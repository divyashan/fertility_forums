I'm sitting here in bed nursing my wounds and trying not to have a full on mental breakdown. Naturally.\n\nI'm convinced my other tube is damaged as well.

I'll be getting testing done to see if the left one is healthy once I'm healed up from this last fiasco but I doubt it.\n\nI know I'm emotional, I'm on pain meds, I'm angry, I'm depressed, I'm probably not in my right mind but I almost just told my husband I wanted a divorce because he said he doesn't consider IVF nor having a surrogate \"natural\". \n\nHe's known from the beginning that I've always wanted children, my own children, and that I have health issues that might make having my own children \"the old fashioned way\" difficult, not only including my damaged reproductive system, I also have a few minor physical disabilities. \n\nHe praised the doctors that just saved my life, was so grateful for the medical interventions that just kept me alive but for some reason rejects the medical interventions that could give us children? I don't get it. \n\nI even have a best friend who's offered to be a surrogate for me since I was a teenager and suffered the major injury that caused my disabilities. She reminded me of this offer when I got married. She's an amazing person and we'd be LUCKY for her to carry our child. We wouldn't have to worry about her eating unhealthy, drinking, smoking, or using drugs which is a huge concern for people using surrogates (what they do when you're not looking), not to mention she's practically a sister to me and would be involved in the child's life and a great influence.\n\nI'm just lost for words and emotions and I'm afraid I'll end my marriage over this. Then I'd have nothing. No husband and no children. Is this a hill worth dying on? I don't know. I'm afraid I'll resent him for the rest of our lives if he denies me the chance to have our own children any way we can.\n\nAgain, I just lost my third baby.

I don't have to explain to this group how devastating these experiences were, how broken I felt. The first one, our first pregnancy, was especially painful physically, and I felt shattered for a while. I wanted to share with you guys some things that have helped me feel better emotionally. To be clear, I don't want to preach. This may not resonate with you and that's ok, but I do hope that this is as helpful to you as it has been for me.\u00a0\n\nMy husband is a social worker and he introduced me to the concept of 'radical acceptance'. As first I balked at it, but it rang a bell with things that I've learned through years of meditation. To start with, there's a bit of a linguistics issue with the phrase 'radical acceptance' in that the word acceptance has a positive connotation. To say \"I accept you\" conveys a sense of positive endorsement. In this case, radical acceptance means accepting circumstances as they are and not resisting what you cannot change. This applies perfectly to pregnancy loss. Every doctor I saw told me there was nothing I could have done differently to stop the miscarriage from happening. This is the circumstance I cannot change.\u00a0\n\nRadical acceptance differentiates between pain and suffering. Pain is the immediate feeling. It was the moment it really hit me walking down the sidewalk after our doctor's appointment when we knew the baby was gone, when I just broke down on my husband's shoulder. Pain was the loss of our hopes. Pain was calling our parents to tell them.\u00a0\n\nSuffering is built on pain, but different from it. Suffering is what you do with the pain and the mental interpretation you put into the pain. Suffering was that, for months and months after, I would cry every day, sometimes at random times. Suffering was when I would get lost in my ruminations about how I was getting too old to have a baby and every pregnancy would be a loss and then we'd never have a family and....\n\nThe point is that the pain is not optional; the suffering is. The circumstances are that I've had two pregnancy losses and I can't change that. However, I can change how I interact mentally with my pain. This sounds easier than it is. Radical acceptance is hard work because you have to learn to accept what you don't want to be true. I've learned to say to myself, \"This seriously sucks. It hurts. But I can't change it. I don't have to agree with it, but I do need to accept that it's a part of my life.\" That's why the acceptance is radical; to say that I accept it as a part of my life even though I desperately want it to be different. By not accepting these painful circumstances is what leads to long drawn out emotional suffering.\u00a0\n\nTo be clear, radical acceptance does not mean inaction. It doesn't mean we've stopped trying to get pregnant. It doesn't mean I'm going to stop trying to figure out what the issue is and fix it. It's something that I'm still grappling with. Sometimes I start going down the mental path of thinking about how we were supposed to have a month old baby right now. Or I get angry that my friend, who I love, got pregnant on the first try. Or upset that I have to participate in yet another baby shower at work. But I'm learning to tell myself that yes, this sucks and it hurts, but I have to accept it. And through that acceptance, I've found healing and peace.", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "ttcafterloss", "subreddit_id": "t5_34scd", "subreddit_subscribers": 4539, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Radical acceptance - about what's helped me cope", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/ttcafterloss/comments/ahxrz5/radical_acceptance_about_whats_helped_me_cope/"}, {"author": "nightwithak", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_6jtue", "author_patreon_flair": false, "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1547996012, "domain": "self.ttcafterloss", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/ttcafterloss/comments/ahy9h5/im_a_ball_of_nerves_waiting_for_my_doctors/", "gildings": {"gid_1": 0, "gid_2": 0, "gid_3": 0}, "id": "ahy9h5", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 6, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/ttcafterloss/comments/ahy9h5/im_a_ball_of_nerves_waiting_for_my_doctors/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1547996013, "score": 1, "selftext": "My wonderful doctor ordered the recurrent miscarriage bloodwork (why women have to wait until they\u2019ve had three miscarriages before they do this panel is insane).

I didn\u2019t pay that much attention then, but always knew my period timing and back then it lasted maybe 4 days sometimes with a gap of no bleeding on day 2. \n\nI got pregnant August 2017 and had my daughter April 22nd 2018 after a car accident and she did not make it. (We are obviously still crushed but that\u2019s not what this post is about so we\u2019re just gonna keep going on with it.) \n\n5 weeks later I got the Mirena IUD. \n\nI have a general idea of when my bleeding stopped (a bit before the IUD) and then my period started postpartum, but not all info because I was grieving and forgot I wanted to track it. \n\nThe second month I had it I remember I didn\u2019t have a period at all. And now it has like most ladies notice, slowed my cycles way down. Which I didn\u2019t care about for months, but now I want to take it out to start trying again this summer. I have been tracking most of my cycles between then and now, except the first 2 or 3 and am noticing how much longer the IUD has drawn it out. My cycle is around 35 days now. \n\nI\u2019m trying to explain to my boyfriend why I want to take it out NOW for LATER this year. I am also hoping it could change my mood for the better- having it out in general (looking forward towards the future) and also the removal of hormones. (I started taking antidepressants so I want less going on if possible.) \n\n\nQuestions:\n\n\u2022 How long did it take you to get back to a more \u201cregular\u201d cycle? \n\n\u2022 Did anyone feel a change in mood after removing their Mirena? \n\u2022part b... Do you think it was hormones or maybe just feeling like things are progressing towards the light at the end of the tunnel so you felt better?\n\n\u2022Does anyone have advice on having the talk about removing an IUD (or going off the pill) way before wanting to try to get things with your body back on track first. \n\n\n** I know with an IUD removal you *could* get pregnant right away but I feel like that is highly unlikely at 34 and the midwife wanted to keep the appointment as positive as possible because of everything that happened to us. \n\n\nWe are cleared to try again medically- because I want a second c section, would be 18 months apart, but we are not both mentally ready yet. \n\nI\u2019m also nervous about trying to get pregnant after a c section, I didn\u2019t have any issues with healing I just feel like it\u2019s something else I have to worry about because it is different than last time. I don\u2019t really need advice on that just knowing someone might feel the same would be nice. \n\n\nAny help is appreciated. \u2665\ufe0f\ud83d\udc7c\ud83c\udffb\n", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "ttcafterloss", "subreddit_id": "t5_34scd", "subreddit_subscribers": 4543, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Cycles after IUD removal", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/ttcafterloss/comments/ai08l9/cycles_after_iud_removal/"}, {"author": "AutoModerator", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_6l4z3", "author_patreon_flair": false, "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1548007730, "distinguished": "moderator", "domain": "self.ttcafterloss", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/ttcafterloss/comments/ai0g7q/ttcafterloss_daily_discussion_thread_2_january_20/", "gildings": {"gid_1": 0, "gid_2": 0, "gid_3": 0}, "id": "ai0g7q", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_css_class": "ttc", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text": "TTC Thread", "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 3, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/ttcafterloss/comments/ai0g7q/ttcafterloss_daily_discussion_thread_2_january_20/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1548007878, "score": 1, "selftext": "**How are you doing today?

My period is 5 days late  and it's not the possibility of being pregnant that is terrifying - it's  the ***possibility of losing another pregnancy.***\n\nLast  January I got pregnant and my husband can't keep a secret to save his  life - he told EVERYONE. He just gets so excited, he can't contain  himself. He told family, friends, everyone, and I even joined in a  little, because yeah, it's exciting!\n\nTwo  weeks after I found out, I started bleeding. For a couple of weeks it  seemed like the pregnancy could be saved, but no... not if it's that  early. I was around seven weeks in.\n\nTwo  weeks of incredibly heavy bleeding and plate-sized clots, a D&amp;C,  then six months of not ovulating because my body decided it needed a  break, apparently, and then exams, and everything went back to normal  and we began to try again.\n\nMy husband is on a work trip and my period is quite late, but I can't be sure because it's been really irregular lately.\n\nI  have a pregnancy test in my bathroom cupboard but I don't want to use  it. I'm not the kind of person who postpones stuff, I always think that  it's better to know than not to know, but this time... I can't.\n\nIf I'm pregnant, I don't want to know, I don't want anybody to know.\n\nThe  possibility of going through all that shit again is paralyzing to say  the least - and I don't even mean just losing the pregnancy (it's not  even a baby at this point). I don't want to deal with the EXPECTATIONS.  With the grandparents hovering and going crazy, with people asking me  how I'm doing, friends getting excited, dealing with the pressure of it -  because if it goes wrong again, I don't know how I'm going to deal with  this. I was never comfortable with giving explanations, with justifying  what I do and how I behave, and this is... so private.\n\nSo I'm working really hard not to talk about this to anyone. Not even my sister, not even my best friends. Not even my husband.\n\nHave any of you gone through this?

This is more asking for guidance rather than a specific question...\nI had a m/c at 8 weeks on December 11th. I had no cramping, a hush of blood for about 20 minutes then just spotting for about a month when my doc finally gave me medication to help it along. It finally stopped on January 8th. Then, my husband and I started having sex again and (tmi) he came inside of me. Then that day I kind of got suspicious and took an OPK kit that I had bought in preparation for next month and sure enough it was positive, and I was ovulating (again, we had just had sex). Then, about a day or two after I passed a couple more spots of (very very small) clots. Now I\u2019m thinking this could mean I conceived and my uterus was cleaning the last bit out. Then I had some mild cramps on the 17th.\nToday I had another symptom. My period is due on Thursday (14 dpo). I went to the bathroom and had a little bit of thickish creamy mucus on my underwear that was pinkish - this happened to me when I got pregnant last time, exactly two days before period due, and I think it\u2019s implantation sporting. \nJust looking for some guidance here - is it really possible that I would have gotten pregnant before I even got a period again?

I was immediately concerned and practically had to fight my OBGYN\u2019s office to see me and check my levels and the first doctor I saw told me it was probably leftover chemical at first. But I pushed for blood tests and it turned out that Hcg was rising normally with progesterone just a little on the low side. I had no regular ectopic symptoms other than what I had thought was AF two weeks before and no risk factors so then they told me not to worry and wait it out. \n\nI pushed for an ultrasound where they didn\u2019t find anything but referred me to a radiologist to double check because I must have seemed a bit \u201cI will sue you if you fuck this up.\u201d Radiologist found swelling in my right tube Thursday, but because my HCG was rising normally but still too low to see anything via ultrasound, they recommended waiting until Monday when they thought they would be able to confirm where the pregnancy was.\n\nYesterday the radiologist confirmed the swelling in my right tube had gotten bigger and I got two very dignified injections of methotrexate into my butt. Now I\u2019m trying to figure out what I can and can\u2019t eat (my doctor said to eat like normal but doctor internet hive mind disagrees) and hoping my levels go down the way they should. One of my cats has been attached to me since my first BFP and my biggest fear is that she\u2019ll springboard off my uterus and cause my tube to rupture. \n\nI\u2019ve been weepy on and off but I don\u2019t think this has fully hit me yet. Being in limbo for the last week was the worst part. I was convinced every twinge or feeling from my middle meant it was a normal pregnancy and that it would be ok and it wasn\u2019t. We\u2019re on hold for at least three months now and my OBGYN has recommended an HSG before we start trying again, which I\u2019m happy about. \n\nThis is a terrible club to join and I\u2019m so sorry for everything anyone here has experienced.

In the past 12 months, my wife and I have had 2 miscarriages. The first one happened a little after 8 weeks, and the second one was a blighted ovum. \n\nI had a semen analysis performed to see if there was anything that I needed to address. \n\nAlthough the analysis was mostly normal, the results show that I have \u201cvery mild esthonnospermia.\u201d The results also stated the doctor\u2019s opinion that he would expect that I am fertile.  The two values that fall outside of the normal range (according to WHO criteria) were \u201cOverall Motility\u201d and \u201cRapid Progressive motility.\u201d My Overall Motility is 44%, whereas the WHO fertile range is greater than 50%. Also, my Rapid Progressive motility is at 23%, where normal is greater than 25%.\n\nMy question is: Does somewhat low motility (like I have) increase the risk of miscarriage or have any bearing on miscarriage whatsoever?  We are trying to determine if I have an underlying problem here or if we just had bad luck in miscarrying twice in a row. Note that we already have 2 healthy boys, ages 4 and 2.   \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf it helps, here are the full results:\n\n* Volume: 2.7 mL --- WHO criteria: 1-6 mL\n* Sperm concentration: 41.5 million/mL --- WHO criteria: more than 20 Million/mL\n* Overall motility (percent of sperm showing movement) 44% --- WHO criteria: more than 50%\n* Rapid progressive motility: 23%  --- WHO criteria: more than 25%\n* Normal morphology (Kruger Method \u201cStrict Morphology\u201d): 17% --WHO criteria: more than 4%\n* pH: 8.0  --- WHO criteria: Between 7.6 and 8.2\n* VAP (Average path velocity): 49.1 \u00b5m/s  --- WHO criteria: more than 44.28\n* VSL: (Straight line velocity): 40.3 \u00b5m/s --- WHO criteria: more than 35.19\n* AHL (Amplitude of lateral head placement): 2.9 \u00b5m/s --- WHO criteria: more than 2.5\n* Straightness (VSL/VAP; Deviation from avg path): 81% --- WHO criteria: more than 74%\n* Linearity (VSL/VCL; Deviation from actual path): 58%: --- WHO criteria: more than 49%\n\nAny input anyone can provide would be greatly appreciated!

The genetic testing revealed trisomy 16. The doctor said while he hates to use the term \"good news\", this is fairly good news because it doesn't indicate anything wrong with my husband or I and it is more just a \"bad luck\" situation. I was feeling (relatively) good about our conversation. He said genetic counseling is available but probably not needed at the point. \n\nToday I logged onto the patient portal to review the full pathology results. The first thing I saw was \"XY\". I searched the karotype information an confirmed that meant the baby I lost was a boy. That was really hard - I would have been happy regardless of gender but my preference was a boy, though I thought surely we'd have a girl (for no real scientific reason, just a feeling). It kind of shifted my thinking from \"I lost a pregnancy incompatible with life\" to \"I lost a son\".\n\nThen I went back and read the report again and noticed a line that said \"It has been reported that there is a 1.8-fold increase in risk for a different viable trisomy (like trisomy 21) after a previous nonviable trisomy has been detected in a spontaneous abort!on.\" I very much want to get pregnant again and had some vague fears around having another miscarriage or not being able to get pregnant but now I am scared I am going to get pregnant and my baby will have something wrong with him/her. When pathology came back with an \"answer\" I thought I was fortunate to know what happened, but now it's seems to be giving me something concrete to worry over. I really want to be positive, I know the odds for bad things happening are still low, and I know it's in my best interest to be calm and unstressed. However I can't help but to feel so unlucky - I read it was a 3% chance of having a MMC, and a 1% chance of having trisomy 16 - and like I might get unlucky again. And then I feel like by thinking these things I am just attracting more bad - like I am putting my negativity out into the universe and the universe is going to give it back. \n\nI know this is all ridiculously illogical, I just needed to say it. The few people I've shared that I've had a MC with have tried  to be supportive but mostly have said (unintentionally) insensitive things, I feel like I have no one to discuss this anxiety with. I reviewed the report with my husband but I don't want to tell him the extent of my worry, and maybe make him worry more too. He is looking at this pretty logically, it was a small chance of genetic defect to begin with and now we know it's a larger but still small risk.", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "ttcafterloss", "subreddit_id": "t5_34scd", "subreddit_subscribers": 4568, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "I got my D&amp;C pathology results", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/ttcafterloss/comments/aj58au/i_got_my_dc_pathology_results/"}, {"author": "beepbeepmotherTruker", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_wmusg", "author_patreon_flair": false, "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1548285883, "domain": "self.ttcafterloss", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/ttcafterloss/comments/aj5z9m/first_af_after_dc/", "gildings": {"gid_1": 0, "gid_2": 0, "gid_3": 0}, "id": "aj5z9m", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 9, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/ttcafterloss/comments/aj5z9m/first_af_after_dc/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1548285885, "score": 1, "selftext": "Hi guys wondering if you guys have any advice.

It is truly heartbreaking to hear your stories, tho it has been very comforting to know I\u2019m not alone in my sadness. Although this is my first ever Reddit post, I have been reading your posts and comments for several months. I\u2019m reaching out to you because I am conflicted about whether to see a RE or just keep trying. I have two healthy kids (2 yrs and 4 yrs old), but this past year I had two miscarriages. The first one we found out in May at the 12 week ultrasound, the baby stopped growing at 9 weeks and I had no signs that I had lost the baby. It was devastating. In November we found out at 8 weeks that we had another miscarriage, this time it was a blighted ovum.  After both miscarriages I had to have D&amp;C\u2019s b/c I didn\u2019t miscarry naturally. A few Ob/gyns at my practice have said that they are 99% sure it\u2019s a chromosomal issue and they think I should just keep trying. I don\u2019t know if I can handle another miscarriage so I insisted on blood work and a semen analysis. The blood work was all normal (thyroid, diabetes, antiphospholipid syndrome) The semen analysis said \u201cvery mild esthonospermia\u201d which impacts motility, but we have not had any issues getting pregnant . My insurance wouldn\u2019t cover an RE after two miscarriages so I became comfortable and trusting of the idea to try again without more tests. We were just getting ready to try again, when my dr told me that because of how long we have been TTC I can see an RE at the end of February. I feel like I just adjusted and began to trust enough to try again and I\u2019m just afraid that the RE\u2019s tests delay will delay us TTC and put us on an emotional roller-coaster without a benefit. I don\u2019t want to do IVF so I\u2019m not really sure what benefit the RE will provide for miscarriage when we don\u2019t have trouble conceiving. My ob/gyn also said that babies conceived within 6 months after miscarriage decreases risk of miscarriage and health issues. I\u2019m 36.5 yrs old btw.

Everything about the stillbirth (the experience, the baby, the aftermath, the what-could-have-beens, etc) dominates my thoughts and completely overshadows the baby I lost in December.\n\nI know it\u2019s partly because the experience was traumatic (I went to the hospital in labor, thinking everything was fine - only to discover when we got there that she didn\u2019t have a heartbeat).\n\nI know it\u2019s partly because I felt her moving inside me for months and got to know her rhythms and preferences. She got the hiccups almost every evening. The last couple of weeks, when I tapped my belly a certain way, she would tap/kick back. It was like getting to have a conversation with her. I felt like I knew her.\n\nI know it\u2019s partly because I gave birth to her, saw her, held her, and named her. I have pictures of her. I know exactly what we lost.\n\nI know it\u2019s partly because when I got pregnant again in October I so closely guarded my heart that I didn\u2019t let myself get my hopes up that the pregnancy would actually lead to a live baby. I couldn\u2019t bear to feel that devastation again, so I didn\u2019t let myself \u201cbuy in\u201d to the pregnancy that early on. When I found out I was miscarrying, it seemed like an inevitability.\n\nBut despite all this, my miscarried baby was my child too. I saw its little heartbeat. It mattered too. I feel so guilty for crying so many tears over one and not as many over the other. It really sucks to feel all the sadness, and then guilt over the sadness on top of it.\n\nI\u2019m currently in the TWW hoping to get my rainbow baby. If/when I do get pregnant, I\u2019m going to try REALLY hard to give that baby the love and confidence and hope from the start that I denied the one I miscarried. I\u2019m afraid of getting crushed again, but I think not getting my hopes up last time hurt more than it helped.\n\nI don\u2019t really know if I\u2019m asking for advice or what. This has just been weighing on me and I can\u2019t really talk about it with friends or family without feeling like a crazy person.

I'm not sure if it makes sense or is all in my head.\n\nAs far back as I can remember, every other period (alternating like clockwork) has been different.\n\nMonth A: period is heavy, dark clots, I am full of hormonal rage, lasts about 4-5 days \n\nMonth B: period is light, smooth like cough syrup, very little PMS, last 3-4 days\n\nI got pregnant with my son (now 3 and healthy) during a cycle in which I would have gotten Period A. Fast forward to now, I'm currently recovering from a miscarriage at 6 weeks (happened naturally) where I had conceived before what would have been Period B. \n\nBecause this was my first loss, my OB would not perform any tests or look at my ovaries or uterus because my bleeding had stopped and my betas were very low (215 on day of miscarriage). Her response was that this could be an issue, but it could also not be an issue. She wouldn't give me much more than that.\n\nMy theory is that there's something with the one ovary or corpus luteum (before Period B) that makes my lining inhospitable to an embryo. Or....it could have just been one of those one in five embryos that isn't  going to develop well and so my body miscarried.\n\nAnd I know very little about the luteal phase, but the one thing I've heard I'd that it's consistent month to month. If that's true, I'm not sure how it could be different from one ovary to the other. I'm also confused about the alternation since I also read that it's antiquated thinking that ovaries actually do that. \n\nGiven this info, would you skip ttc those months, the ones before Period B? I'm generally pretty data-oriented and find it incredibly stressful to be making this kind of decision based on two data points. \n\nOn one hand, better safe than sorry. \n\nOn the other hand, I have long cycles and this puts our next try to late March/early April. It also took us a long time to conceive this one, so I'm looking at another year or two of trying if that's any indication (I know it isn't necessarily).\n\nWhat would you do?

First, what a messed up view of being a parent.  I feel so bad for her kids having to hear that.  And second, she knows exactly what we've been going through these past 2 years and still does this around me and expects my support about how hard it is to be a parent. \n\nI had one of my miscarriages on a family vacation, and she comments later, when I had not brought up the subject, \"You must have had the worst vacation in history, except for that one lady who killed herself.

I think she might legit have Asperger's, but she's super defensive about it - insisting everyone else keeps misinterpreting her words and never apologizing.

I tried to explain over email why her comments hurt me, but she took it personally and did the \"I can't just forget my children!\" and tried to guilt trip me about how much her kids love me and I'm abandoning them.  Now I really don't want to be around her (and it tears my heart to not be seeing my nephews because of this.  But I just can't handle it).  It's making family gatherings more difficult and uncomfortable, because she won't leave me alone and can't handle that I don't want to be around her anymore.

(Little did we know there were other things wrong that weren\u2019t mentioned.) \n\nWeek 27- The one small thing turned in to a much much larger issue. The doctor downplayed the issue (probably because I was crying and close to a panic attack) and referred me to a high risk doctor. This began the worst month of my entire life. After that appointment, I went into a deep depression filled with the worst anxiety I\u2019ve ever had. There were moments I wished I wasn\u2019t alive. I started taking Zoloft. I lost my personality and want my old self back. We had been saving for years to buy a house for our new family. We literally closed on our dream home two days after we found out something was wrong with the baby. It was heartbreaking. It was supposed to be one of the best moments of our lives. We bought this house with our baby in mind and moving in was unimaginably hard. \n\nWeek 28- The MFM confirmed the diagnosis and ordered an amnio and TORCH test. Those came back fine in the next week.  She wasn\u2019t overly concerned with the baby. \n\nWeek 29- I had a horrible feeling and requested an MRI. The doctor told me that most people in my situation would not get an MRI but she ordered one for us anyways. \n\nWeek 30-The MRI came back showing extensive damage. Scientific research showed that babies with this condition would have a very poor quality of life so we decided to TFMR. We told the MFM our choice and she tried to give us so much hope for the baby. I wanted so badly to believe that \"false hope\" and it still haunts me. (We live in a very religious area and through this process so many medical professionals were openly against termination no matter the circumstance.) We requested our MRI report and were shocked to see we were never informed about the other issues with our baby. I cried every hour after we made our choice. Every single baby kick was horribly bitter sweet. He was happy inside of me and it killed me to know what was going to happen to him. \n\nI called the clinic and scheduled the procedure. I was shocked with how professional, understanding and compassionate the ladies were who worked there. Once all my medical documents had been received proving that I was in fact terminating for a medical reason, they put me on the schedule. We booked our flights and hotel. \n\nThe night before the procedure I cried the entire night as I held my bump. My husband felt him kick for the last time. \n\nWeek 30+4 Day 1: We arrived at the clinic where the procedure would happen. We told nobody. I was terrified. My husband was so strong. I was yet again shocked with how kind the staff was to me. My husband wasn\u2019t allowed to be there for any portion of the termination. He had to wait in the lobby for all 4 days. They did an ultrasound, thankfully they had the screen turned from me and they didn\u2019t make me look. Then they took me to talk with a counselor. She explained the procedure to me and they wanted to make sure nobody was forcing me to get it done. I cried most of the morning thinking about my little boy. Thinking about what would happen to him. How much I would miss him. I was scared. Pretty much anytime anybody spoke to me, I cried. They called my husband in at the end of the counseling to explain to him how to care for me over the next few days and see if he had any concerns. They told me they were ready to start the termination. I asked my husband if we were sure that we were making the right choice. He said yes. We cried and hugged, I didn\u2019t want to let go of him. That was the last time the 3 of us were together. They took me to a room that looked like a regular doctors office room. They put in an IV and gave me an anxiety and pain medicine. It did nothing for me. I had about 5 people helping to calm me down as the doctor inserted that thing that opens up your vagina. I couldn\u2019t stop crying. I felt him kick for the last time. I couldn\u2019t control my crying or my thoughts, I cried so loud. I knew they were about to end my baby\u2019s life. I wanted my husband. They inserted the needle through my cervix into my baby\u2019s head which allowed him to go to sleep peacefully forever. I screamed when they told me it was done. None of it really physically hurt but my heart was shattered. They inserted 4 laminaria sticks to help induce me and I was done for the morning. They had me come back in the afternoon to verify that the injection worked. We went and picked up a prescription for oxycodone and I took one. It numbed all of my body and emotions. When I went back later that day, the doctor did an ultrasound and I asked if my boy was gone. She said \u201cyes, but you knew that though.\u201d She was right, I hadn\u2019t felt any kicks since the injection. I took more oxycodone and didn\u2019t really process the fact that I had my dead sons body in my stomach. \n\n30+5 Day 2: They inserted an IV along with more anxiety drugs. They took out the laminaria sticks and inserted 8 more. My cervix wasn\u2019t ready so they gave me a pill to soften it. They sent me back to the hotel for the day. I took oxycodone as directed on the bottle and slept most of the day. I started to get bad cramps in the middle of the night but nothing too crazy. \n\n30+6 Day 3: They gave me two pills of misoprostol first thing in the morning to hold between my cheek and gum for 30 minutes. I started to get concerned that I didn\u2019t have any cramps. The other women there seemed to be doubled over in pain. My flight was scheduled for the next day and I didn\u2019t want to get sent back to the hotel to try again tomorrow. I asked for a double dose of the IV anxiety meds because I swear what they were giving me didn\u2019t work. They took out the laminaria sticks and said we would try and see if my body would respond. I completely forgot until now that they broke my water. They sent me into a room with 2 other women. We weren\u2019t allowed an epidural and we had been informed that the concentration of drip pain meds wouldn\u2019t do much once we actually started to labor. I heard the lady next to me give birth and get taken away. I was jealous. I sat in my bed and wished I had contractions. They gave me 2 more pills of misoprostol then the pain hit me hard. Any time I moved, the contractions killed me. It was the most intense pain of my life. My expanding cervix blocked my urethra and I was unable to pee. I gladly accepted the catheter as they emptied my bladder. I never thought I would be cool with getting something shoved up my pee hole without an epidural. I felt every bit of it and the relief was worth it. My contractions were so bad they made me wish I had killed myself back in week 27 when I had those thoughts. I cried and screamed for 3 more hours. I pooped myself trying to push out a baby that wasn\u2019t close to being ready to be pushed out. About an hour later I gave up and let the pain take over and thats when he finally started to lower. I pushed and pushed and finally made some progress. They saw his head so they covered my legs so I wouldn\u2019t see. I saw them grab the bag they were going to put him in. I yelled that I wanted them to pull him out and I felt the nurse help spread my vagina and try. I pushed and pushed. My baby\u2019s head was measuring 33+ weeks due to the damage and it sure felt like it. Once his head was out, I gave up. They kept asking me to push more I couldn\u2019t. Once I managed to get his whole body out, fluids spilled everywhere they ran down my back. I was soaked, my sock was soaked. I pushed out the placenta and then I looked up and saw them take my boy away in his bag. At this point everything happened so fast. I went limp and they sat me up, contained all my fluids and whisked me away to an empty room. I don\u2019t remember the trip to the other room, all I remember was feeling so empty and lifeless. They quickly transferred me to a different bed. I felt like I had nothing left. My vagina felt like shredded meat and they very urgently did a uterus massage. The doctor came in and did a D&amp;C to remove what was left of my placenta. She told me that I had torn my cervix. I don\u2019t remember what else happened\u2026all I know was that I felt so sad. They made me stay for the next few hours to watch my bleeding. I think I saw pitocin was in my IV bag. I was still unable to pee so they did another catheter on me. I was able to pee on my own later that afternoon and then they sent me on my way. I don\u2019t remember much about what we did that evening, I guess I slept. \n\nWeek 31 (4th day at the clinic) We stayed in bed until about 11am then we packed our bags and went to the funeral home. My husband picked out his urn. It was the exact urn that I was thinking of. When I told my husband it was beautiful, he had a breakdown. It broke my heart to see him so sad. We signed the paperwork to have our baby cremated and mailed to us. We got lunch and then went back to the clinic. They took us into a private room to show us our baby. I was terrified to see him. Completely terrified. This is my first child and I had no clue what kind of emotions this would bring out. I was shaking with fear. What would he look like after I so violently pushed him out of my vagina? What would he look like after being dead for 3 days. Would I be overcome with tremendous guilt? The counselor was there to talk us through these emotions before they brought him out. Once we were ready, they brought him out in a cute little basket. He was under a blanket. I uncovered him and he was swaddled with a blue hat on. He was beautiful. We both had a breakdown. We took turns holding him and being his parents. I can\u2019t stop crying as I type this. We unswaddled him and looked at his cute little hands and feet. They let us stay with him for as long as we needed. It felt like nearly 45 minutes and I didnt want to leave him. Although he was cold, he still felt perfect. He was our child. They gave us a memory box with pictures of him and his hand and foot prints. When they took him, they brought us back his little hat and swaddle blanket. I miss my baby so fucking much. When we left the clinic we went straight to the airport and were home just a few hours later. We walked in our dark, new, empty house and cried. (I know I didn't say too many good things about the clinic for obvious reasons...but they did an absolutely amazing job of caring for me and comforting me in the worst time of my life. I am very thankful for them and how they took care of me and my baby.) \n\nToday: My milk came in with a vengeance. I have about 3 oxycodone left and will take one per day along with the ibuprofen they prescribed to help me through the next few days of boob and vagina pain. Hopefully by then I won\u2019t need anymore medication. I\u2019ve been struggling to go through the motions this weekend. My husband has been making sure I get out of bed each morning and take care of myself. I\u2019m planning on going back to work sometime this week. Everybody knows my baby was stillborn and I think I have a good support system. I\u2019m hoping we can start trying again around my due date (late march/early April.) We want to meet with a different MFM who will help us figure out if it was genetic before we try. Anyways\u2026I know this was long and I\u2019m not sure what the point was. I guess it was therapeutic to type out. We are calling counselors tomorrow to see if we can get help. Thank you for allowing me a space to share what happened as I don\u2019t have anybody else who I can tell right now.

I had an ultrasound that confirmed everything passed, but maybe there was something leftover that wasn\u2019t the larger products of conception? I don\u2019t know.
