However, even with the wealth of knowledge I have come to realise that self advocacy is such a key part of receiving appropriate medical care.\n\nI am a chronic researcher, I don't like the feeling of not understanding something that is being discussed with me. Because of this, I went to my follow up appointments armed with questions and basic knowledge that would help me understand the advice I was being given in relation to the results of my medical tests. Because of this I was able to identify two instructions that I received from one senior doctor that not only was incorrect, could have potentially been detrimental to my chances of a future successful pregnancy / birth (I made sure to receive second opinions from equally and/or more qualified physicians to confirm my suspicions).\n\nPart of my results also showed that a medical condition that I had already known about, that I had brought up with many different doctors over the years and was repeatedly dismissed or put on medication that treated the symptoms but not the condition itself, may be the underlying thread to my history of pregnancy issues, infertility, and pre-term births. I had always thought it was an issue, but I didn't like pushing back on doctors because I didn't want to be a problem patient. But not anymore.\n\nBe the problem patient. Seek second opinions. Demand more if you feel your concerns are being dismissed. Medical science is always advancing, standard advice is always changing. Doctors are not specialists in everything, and are not always going to be up to date in every topic. Opinions differ between doctors in the same specialty.

This post might me a little TMI but I need people to relate to. We\u2019re on cycle #2 after our miscarriage and back on my fertility meds so it\u2019s the first cycle that we\u2019re actively trying again. \n\nHusband has been a trooper this past week, but since I don\u2019t know when I ovulate we\u2019ve been doing the deed every other day, which is a lot since we barely do it once every week (because of me). \n\nHe admitted today that while he knows getting pregnant again is everything to me/us, he gets nervous thinking about me going through a miscarriage again. He also said it\u2019s been difficult for him to stay hard (he has been coming but I guess it took a lot of work for him mentally to get there) and now he\u2019s afraid he might have ED (he\u2019s only 27). He\u2019s been looking into vitamins and all that, getting pretty nervous about himself too. I\u2019m usually the one with anxiety so it\u2019s scaring me a little to see my strong partner unsure of himself. \n\nWe tried again tonight and I thought it was going well but he stopped and got soft inside me. He\u2019s being as open as he can about it and is reassuring me it\u2019s not because of me but I can\u2019t help but feel like it could be me along with his stress. \n\nI just don\u2019t know what he / I / we can do about this. I know he\u2019s anxious and I\u2019ve accepted that we won\u2019t get pregnant this cycle but what can be done before next cycle comes along so we\u2019re / he\u2019s ready?", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "ttcafterloss", "subreddit_id": "t5_34scd", "subreddit_subscribers": 7773, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "nsfw", "title": "Husband can\u2019t perform", "total_awards_received": 0, "treatment_tags": [], "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/ttcafterloss/comments/hrj9j0/husband_cant_perform/"}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "hereberainbows", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_7a6cvet1", "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_premium": false, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1594809481, "domain": "self.ttcafterloss", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/ttcafterloss/comments/hrl9p2/hi_new_here_and_ttc_again_after_3_losses/", "gildings": {}, "id": "hrl9p2", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 21, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/ttcafterloss/comments/hrl9p2/hi_new_here_and_ttc_again_after_3_losses/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1594815455, "score": 3, "selftext": "Hi all,\n\nNew to the group,  I had 3 losses in pretty quick succession a few years ago.

Was told by OB on June 3 that I had a \"very thick lining\" but that all products of conception had passed, and told to come back if I didn't get a period within 6 weeks.\n\nJune 13 I started what I thought was my period - timing made sense - but it was insanely light. Not what I expected based on OB telling me about thick lining.\n\nI shrugged it off knowing that the first cycles can be weird, started OPKs after that wrapped up, seemed to get a totally logically timed positive OPK on CD14, and we were actively ttc.\n\nI got my period again on July 9 (so again timing makes sense - would give me a 27 day cycle) but THIS ONE was bad. I normally have fairly uneventful and relatively pain free periods but this one was cramping, heavy (for me) bleeding, acne, headaches - blegh. So I figured OK - that has to be my first \"legit\" period then compared to the first.\n\nThat period seemed to end last Saturday. Cool. Except then I start very slight (like just when wiping only) spotting, which I've never had before post period. That continued on until last night when I'm getting ready for bed and I nearly have a freaking panic attack because I suddenly feel something passing out of me - it felt just like the m/c two months ago. I waddle to the bathroom pretty much losing it and out comes a walnut sized, red hard/rubbery gigantic lump. WHAT THE FUCK YOU GUYS. Followed by a bunch of sort of bloody mucusy discharge. I have a photo but I'll spare you that unless someone has a reason to look - but if you imagine a walnut sized model of a brain (yeah, weird) that's exactly what it looked like. It was not just a clump of tissue or a clot - it was so thick/tough that I couldn't break it apart, like a rubber ball. After considerable effort I ripped it apart and it looked like thick dark raw steak on the inside. barf.\n\nThe only plausible explanation I can think of is that I had some sort of weird stunted period that first time around, and I got a super excess of uterine lining that had been in there for some time, and it somehow combined itself into whatever came out last night. Because I had multiple transvaginal ultrasounds with the OB who said there was no products of conception left.... and I am 1000% not pregnant so anything weird like ectopic or whatever is also out.\n\nSo here I am feeling humiliated by my own dumbass body again, thinking I was on my way to getting back to normal.\n\nAll that said, I have no idea if I should be going back to OB or if I should just hope for the millionth time that this shit is finally wrapping up. Or if I should be worried about continuing to TTC this month if something is messed.

I saw some signs of ovulation at day 23, took an LH test that looked positive and so started temping that night. I saw the spike, and I'm seeing the crash now, but it's only been 10 days since I ovulated. I often spot for a few days before a period starts, but this started out as actual bleeding, though light. \n\nWe're WTT, so it's not like I'm worried my luteal phase was too short for implantation, but did anyone else experience this after a second trimester loss? Did you even back out to closer to two weeks soon? I'm doing seed cycling to try to regulate, and supplementing with OTC topical progesterone, but I'm anxious that this loss has made my cycle wonky or permanently damaged my luteal phase length. \n\nJust going to add: insult to injury, this first period happened to fall just at the same week as our first real vacation in years.

I have been using OPKs for the past cycle, but my LH seems to surge and maybe not peak, or it has multiple peaks. Temping has been difficult because I do shift work, and work overnights 50% of the time and I seem warmer when I wake up post night shift. \n\nTo add to this I work an extremely stressful job (frontline in healthcare) and my SIL just announced they got pregnant on their first try last month.

I suspect my cycles are irregular more related to stress and not taking care of myself as well. \n\nI am just wondering if anyone else has experience irregular cycles post MC not related to PCOS and if they eventually normalized.\n\nI am awaiting a referral to gyne...", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "ttcafterloss", "subreddit_id": "t5_34scd", "subreddit_subscribers": 7787, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Changes in Cycle and TTC after Loss", "total_awards_received": 0, "treatment_tags": [], "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/ttcafterloss/comments/ht0etw/changes_in_cycle_and_ttc_after_loss/"}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "JoJuJo", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_53wqq9uh", "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_premium": false, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1595009086, "domain": "self.ttcafterloss", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/ttcafterloss/comments/ht0l7b/slightly_bitter_about_past_pregnancy_and_loss/", "gildings": {}, "id": "ht0l7b", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_css_class": "trigger", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_template_id": "7465d7b8-7120-11e4-9568-12313d14791d", "link_flair_text": "Trigger - enter type here", "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 2, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/ttcafterloss/comments/ht0l7b/slightly_bitter_about_past_pregnancy_and_loss/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1595009097, "score": 1, "selftext": "TW loss, abusive relationship, attempt at forced abortion. \n\nOkay I will delete this but I am so sick of it I need to talk. \n\nHad an ex and it eventually devolved into pretty abusive.

Anyway towards the end ish I decided to get a diaphragm instead of condoms. \n\nSo not only did I get pregnant from sex ONE TIME, WITH A DIAPHRAGM, with an idiot who was on all kinds of drugs, but I also \u201cjust knew\u201d I was pregnant.  Ugh.   And then he was really heavily pushing the abortion path which I didn\u2019t really want in my heart but tbh I was scared of him.  I went in to the place and they told me it was what I think was a blighted ovum and there was only a sac no bb.   It was a chromosomal thing nothing wrong with me and it never would have been a full pregnancy. \n\nI was frankly quite relieved and took the pill to eliminate the sac but only did it after being assured I wasn\u2019t having an abortion just based on my own desire not to.  I had been happy about the baby but if I said anything like that he would get super mad.  \n\nI dumped him shortly after.   And then I spent a lot of years beating myself up for \u201chaving an abortion\u201d just in case I like intended it deep down (not judging anyone about this but it was just my own personal view and standard for myself.)\n\nOkay I guess I didn\u2019t understand I was just going through grief of losing a pregnancy even if it wasn\u2019t planned and I didn\u2019t realize it was normal to not be the same, to have felt like a mother and then lost it.

Again not sure why they made me wait) I was given my first round of MTX in the cancer ward of a hospital, at an hcg of over 10,0000 (!!!! Again. Just completely shitty care. None of this should have ever happened.)\nNaturally at this high of an hcg I needed a second round of MTX.\nWhat nobody told me (again, not shocking considering the quality of my care after the fact) was that MTX kills your ovarian reserve. I had blood panels done a month before this ectopic and it was all normal, so I have a good reference point. My AMH was 2.6 and FSH was 5. Perfect!\n\nIt took almost four months for my hcg to hit 0 and I decided to stop listening to the shitty advice of my shitty doctor. I moved across the country and started supplements (yes, even folate, because, f* em, mtx is only active in your body for 7 days, thereafter you can drink booze and eat normally again and after about 30 days you can start taking folate to try to heal your body asap, it will NOT slow down your hcg breakdown, that is a complete myth after 30 days, there is zero evidence to that), working out, etc. \nWhat you can do to increase the hcg breakdown is to increase your liver function and cell turnover, by exercising and eating clean and feeding your damaged cells all the good nutrients they need.\nAlso, please go to therapy: I got post partum depression after my last MTX shot and it's extremely terrible. Yes you can get this even if you didn't actually give birth. It is causes by a sudden dramatic shift in hormones. You don't have to go through this alone. \n\nI changed doctors and sought out a highly regarded fertility clinic here in California to try to figure out what the hell happened and why. Both my husband and I got tested again and well wouldn't you know! \n\nFirst, my AMH was essentially killed at 0.8 now along with my AFC at a mere 4 total, and FSH at a 9 and the rest of my hormones were complete shit. I'm like a couple of months away from being premenopausal. While mtx is only active in your body for 7 days, it damages the environment for proper egg growth for at least 180 days (Stanford study) and your egg reserve and quality will be shit until after that time is over. So I got a little bit of hope here at least.\n\nSecond, my hsg came back clear. Of course. Some of the studies I waltzed through show that up to 97.5% of women with ectopics actually have clear tubes when tested after the ectopic (note, HSGs can only test for structural issues, not functional ones like issues with ciliae, that you can only assess during a lap surgery. You're not likely to have functional issues unless you also have Endo or PCOS or other medical conditions). So I started to become suspicious of why that happened to me in the first place, since I have no other medical conditions. \nAll the doctors so far I had talked to said that ectopics are either just random or due to blocked tubes but that is actually only the minority of cases! The most likely and highly preventable cause is here: \n\nmy husband got another SA but this time, an \"advanced semen analysis report\" that also looks for DNA fragmentation. This does not get picked up by a regular SA. \nAnd what would you know.... Turns out he has pyospermia (white blood cells in his semen) that are the cause of his high DNA fragmentation (it should be ideally less than 8%, he is at 26%. You're considered infertile at 30%). Dna fragmentation doesn't stop you from conceiving, but it does cause ectopics and miscarriages, especially missed miscarriages. \nEven when doing IVF, because unless you ask for a DNA fragmentation test, they will commonly just do a regular semen analysis where this issue won't show, and you will likely make \"normal\" embryos, because even PGS testing doesn't pick up dna fragmentation, and you will keep getting ectopics and miscarriages, wondering what the f*.\nOnce you know your partner has DNA fragmentation, your IVF lab can use a special procedure during ivf to sort these broken guys out, lowering your risk of ectopics/miscarriages, called PICSI/zymot or just do TESE. \nWe decided on the ivf route because of our currently extremely high chance of miscarriage and ectopic and I cannot physically do another treatment for an ectopic and ruin the few eggs I have left. \nWhether or not you do IVF (because hello, cost), definitely also send your partner to a reproductive urologist to get a culture taken to cure whatever underlying inflammation there may be and check for varicoles. All this can cause DNA fragmentation, and it can be improved!\n\nWell now you know. \nGET YOUR MALE PARTNER'S SPERM TESTED FOR DNA FRAGMENTATION!\n\nIt aggravates me to no end that fertility issues/investigations always seem to be focusing the women, as if nothing could ever be wrong with the dudes. \n\nAnyway, hope my experience can help someone out there, good luck and keep pushing! Don't believe what your doctor is telling you, always double check, and get second and third opinions. \n\nI'll do another write up of all things HSG soon. \nThere aren't enough people talking about fertility issues and it's so nice to have a community to learn from and exchange knowledge and stories. \n\nSource of all this: me, 31F medical student specializing in public health.", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "ttcafterloss", "subreddit_id": "t5_34scd", "subreddit_subscribers": 7792, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Recurring miscarriages or ectopics?

Lol.\n\nWell it turns out that the ultrasound you get at your ob or REs office cannot see everything in your uterus that might be helpful. These things can only be seen with more invasive imaging or advanced imaging, as for example through an HSG. \n\nAn hsg can show you if you have a heart shaped uterus, a septum, a septate uterus, polyps, fibroids, other growths, etc. All these things will cause you to miscarry and a lot of them.can be fixed! \nIf you've ever had a late term miscarriage, still birth or early labor, placenta issues such as placenta abbrevia etc, I would HIGHLY recommend for you to get an HSG done. Heart shaped uteri especially can stretch out during pregnancy so on the ultrasound they may look normal, but they're not, and they're causing circulatory problems for the baby as it grows. \nKnowing this before you get pregnant can help to prevent some of these nightmares because it will put you into the high risk pregnancy category and you'll get monitored like crazy to make sure they can get your baby out in the third trimester before anything happens to it, I.e growth issues, still birth, and late term miscarriage.\n\nTHIS was totally worth it for me to get an hsg done and sure enough, I have a heart shaped uterus.\nThank God I know this now because none of my REs or OBs ultrasounds has ever picked this up before.\n\nWhere to go in the Los Angeles area:\nDr Chin at San Fernando valley interventional radiology in Encino, California, is THE BEST DOCTOR OF ALL TIMES when it comes to hsg.\nI FELT NOTHING. absolutely nothing.

I, like all of you I'm sure, didn't expect to be part of this community. But here I am and I'm actually really grateful this place exists. (Mobile, I don't know what I'm doing, I'm still bad at Reddit somehow)\n\nI'm not sure where to start. I have a lot of questions about what to do now and I feel really lost after having the most stressful week of my life. Stress may have played part in some of what's happened, but I am trying not to blame myself. My husband and I conceived on cycle 2 for baby number 2. It was really exciting, but I got vvfl super early on and they never got too dark so immediately I felt dread and concern that something was wrong. My partner, the ever-optimistic one, kept saying things about hydration or maybe tracking incorrectly (lol) and tried to think of every reason why it wasn't what I thought it was. But I called my previous midwife, got my hcg drawn twice, and it was confirmed. I was crushed, but somehow almost relieved I wasn't just paranoid and my instinct was right? But still mostly just really fucking sad. \n\nAbout 3 hours after that call, my old boss called. I took a voluntary layoff in April because my job exposed me to covid-19 (though with extensive protection) and that caused my daughter to be expelled from childcare and we have no family nearby to help us. So they offered me a voluntary out being that their financials crashed due to the virus and told me I'd be welcome back when they could rehire people. When the office manager called, she said they filled my job due to seniority (the other person got hired literally days before me) and offered me a different position with excruciating hours, much more stress, higher exposure risk, and at a different location that's even farther than my almost 1hr commute was. So I had to decline, not only because fuck no but because they needed an answer Monday and I don't know if I can find childcare by the following week. The position I held was so important to me and the best job I've ever had and I'm so sad to lose it. My supervisor made it very clear my job was being reserved for me and to enjoy my time with my daughter and now I feel stupid.\n\nTo top it off, were in the middle of selling our home. It's stressful, I'm not sleeping, I'm sad as hell, I can't go anywhere or see anyone, I'm so exhausted, and now I'm grieving this fleeting moment of joy I had just last week. 7 days ago, I thought, \"Everything is going so well, I'm so lucky.\" I'm fine. I'm safe. I'm healthy for the most part. I'm grateful for the things that are good in my life and I have a really supportive partner. But seriously, I'm so tired.\n\nSo if you made it this far, thanks and sorry for whining so much. Now here are my questions.\n\nThis is my first time experiencing pregnancy loss of any kind. It hit hard for both my husband and me, as it does with everyone. But now we just don't know what's going to happen. For reference, I think I was about 5 weeks when the hcg stopped going up and I have another hcg draw on Thursday. What can I expect? I haven't had any bleeding thus far, I spotted a little bit a few days ago and that's it. Minor cramping started today. Will it take a while? I read it was like a really heavy period sometimes, should that be considered CD1 then? How do I get back on tracking and OPKs? I've also never temped and I thought about starting to do that. Idk, I'm just lost and I don't know what would help, so maybe someone else knows.\n\nSo, thanks for listening/reading my woes. I just don't know what to do now or where to go from here. I appreciate any help or advice. Again, sorry this is so long. \u2764\ufe0f Hope you are all doing well and staying safe.", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "ttcafterloss", "subreddit_id": "t5_34scd", "subreddit_subscribers": 7810, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Intro/Question/Vent: Feeling really low after CP, and life is just hard.

In February at a pens game all my social life fears resolved when my best friend told me she was pregnant too. Great! We get to go through this together, raise kids together and enjoy life. No one knew what was coming when in March my 20 week scan turned out to reveal all these issues and we said goodbye to our first baby girl. It was also the start of covid so good bye coping skills. My SIL and bff are moving along blissfully with their pregnancy with my SIL due this week. I\u2019m so jealous and sad. My due date was the 27th and I\u2019m feeling it terribly. When my period came this month I was crushed, that was it, my last chance before due date and it\u2019s gone. It\u2019s been 4 months of trying with no luck. I had hoped to be pregnant now so I can enjoy my niece and soon to be besties baby in October. \nNow, I find myself not fitting in anywhere.

On the other hand, I\u2019m scared that if we try now before I\u2019ve been taking the supplements for 3 months, that I\u2019ll have another miscarriage (or there will be some type of other chromosome abnormality or birth defect).
