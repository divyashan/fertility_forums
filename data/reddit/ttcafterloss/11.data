It just makes me too anxious to post regularly about my TTC situation, as it makes me think about it incessantly.  \n\nAs background, I lost my first pregnancy at 12 weeks in June of last year, then my second pregnancy shortly after in August.  Since then we hadn't tried again seriously up until four months ago.  \n\nI thought I had finally met someone in real life to relate to somewhat.  A close friend of mine and her husband were struggling with infertility for the better part of a year.  Every month we'd have a 'period party' with wine and have a good time celebrating our independence.  Well, she just found out she's pregnant.  I'm happy for her, but now I feel alone again.\n\nI don't want this life anymore.  Month in and month out, waiting and wondering, and just feeling like my self-worth is tied to my fertility is driving me crazy.  Of course I know rationally that I'm far more than my ability to conceive, but having to put so much effort into it is taking the romance out of it and frankly draining me of my individuality and identity outside of this uncertainty as to whether my life is going to change soon or not.\n\nI hate that everyone around me is having kids.  My parents are wonderful, but I know they want a grandchild, and I hate disappointing them even though I know they love me anyway.  I want to abandon my current life and live alone somewhere with my pets.  My husband can come if he wants.\n\nI'm sorry for the rant.  I just have no one to talk to at all.  My husband is understanding, and he'll tell me that we will do whatever I want to do, but I feel responsible for his future as well and I don't have the heart to make a unilateral decision about our next move.\n\nSo I've taken the last two days off to just kind of wallow in self-pity.  Nothing is helping me out of this slump.  I don't know what to do to stop feeling like this.  I don't want to push my friend away just because she's pregnant, but I don't feel like I can talk to her about my pain anymore.  I feel alone yet again, a familiar feeling since starting this whole journey nearly two years ago.\n\nEdit: I'm blown away by your kindness - I am crying for all of you as well as myself now.  I am so grateful for your responses - thank you so much for sharing your stories and relating to me when I am at one of my darkest moments.  I just had my mother over and told her how I was feeling.  She offered to pay for fertility treatment, which is not what I was looking for in asking her to come over.   I know this is her own way of offering support to me, but I explained to her that I'm just not sure I want my life to revolve around my fertility anymore.  I just don't think anyone can possibly understand how difficult this is unless they have been through it, which is why I posted here.  I know you all have.  I am eternally grateful to live in an age in which it is possible to connect with you, when otherwise we'd never have this chance.

I couldn't breath and had to remove my clothes just to get some relief. This lasted for about 10 minutes and after that I was still feeling very weak. I called the nurse line at my obgyn and they said to go to the emergency room. At the hospital they suspected that I had a pulmonary embolism and did a bunch of tests that all came out negative. They looked at the fetus and saw he was still there but didn't check that he had a heartbeat.\n\nAfter that day I stopped feeling him kick and my stomach started to shrink (I was able to fit into my regular clothes again) but I still had other pregnancy symptoms.\n\nI had a d&amp;c last Friday and went back to work yesterday but I can't seem to stop thinking about what happened and had a very hard time focusing.\n\nThe thing is, I felt a little ambivalent about having a baby because I have a health condition that may prevent me from having kids in the future so my husband and I started ttcing very early into the marriage and I felt guilty about this since he is younger than me and I was concerned that maybe we should enjoy being alone for another year or so.\n\nNow, after I lost my baby, I obviously don't feel this way. I feel very guilty that I felt abmivalent about my poor former stomach dweller. \n\nMy husband and I had almost every test possible. We had genetic testing prior to conceiving for me as well as fertility testing and we had the panorama test for the baby and he had zero abnormalities. The pregnancy was progressing really well until 16 weeks and I was taking medication to reduce the chance of miscarriage (for my thyroid) as well as taking prenatal vitamins. I was walking twice a day and eating healthy and just generally taking care of myself as much as I can.\n\nI'm just at such a loss as to what went wrong since having a miscarriage at such a late stage is so rare with absolutely zero indication of any warning signs. I do have a uterine fibroid but the ultrasound tech has been monitoring it throughout the pregnancy and said it was small enough to not be a problem. Maybe in hindsight she was wrong. I am very afraid of this being the start of a long journey with multiple miscarriages. I don't know if I can handle it.\n\nI asked that the fetus be tested to see if there was something wrong with him. The doctor was supposed to give me an amnio while I was under general anesthesia but since he had been dead for such a long time, there was no fluid left. They were able to take a tissue sample from the fetus and hopefully that will have some live cells in it that they can test.\n\nI was wondering if any of you had any experience with testing after a late miscarriage. My obgyn wants me to just try again and not pursue any testing. She says it may have been a cord accident but I really want some peace of mind so this won't happen again.\n\nShould I insist on a recurring miscarriage blood test? Are you aware of any other tests besides this one?

Like I said in the previous post - I don't want to create too many rules for this sub, because I feel like that can be overwhelming and discouraging for newbies, and I want this sub to be as welcoming to them as possible. I also checked out the user flair page and it seems like the vast majority of \"alumni\" have not mentioned anything about their subsequent pregnancies in their flair. I know that many of us have different words/phrases/etc. that can be triggers.. but since we're all different, it's honestly impossible to make this place 100% free of them. If something comes up in the future that bothers a lot of users, we can definitely do another poll to decide if it should be discouraged or banned.\n\nI'd also like to remind everyone that you can use [Reddit Enhancement Suite](http://redditenhancementsuite.com/) to automatically hide posts with certain keywords (for instance, you could set it to hide the daily \"alumni\" thread by using the keyword \"alumni\").

Same time I'm kinda happy that now I won't have two in diapers but still, that's what I actually wanted. Also since second one takes longer than planned, it has put our life in limbo. We are going to move next summer and I was supposed to be at maternity leave/parental leave until our new address is clear, but now I need to find job I guess.\n\nI'm just hoping that she forgets those few mentions of me being pregnant and she becoming big sister. While those questions are coming rarer, I'm still in tears everytime she talks about it.\n\nSo what are your cons and pros if there are any?

A week before that we'd had our first ultrasound, and little blip was measuring behind, but within the margin of error (I wasn't 100% sure of O date). A repeat scan the next week showed no fetal growth and no heartbeat, and we were diagnosed with a missed miscarriage. I scheduled a D&amp;C for a week later, hoping my body would take matters into its own hands first. It did not, other than very slowly decreasing hCG numbers, so I had the D&amp;C on Friday. It went as well as these things go and the physical recovery has not been bad.\n\nAnyway. I don't yet know what our future TTC plans will involve. We will wait at least until I've had a period after the D&amp;C to try again, maybe longer. We were lucky to get pregnant quickly the first time, so hopefully that will happen again once we're ready, though I have some concerns about my body's ability to hold on to a pregnancy after this. My doctor said the location of a fibroid (even though it's small) could have led to this miscarriage, because implantation was so close. They didn't seem concerned about it happening again but it still gives me pause...what's to stop the next pregnancy from implanting in the same place? I'm scared that we'll get pregnant quickly again only to go through another MC.\n\nSorry for the rambling. Basically just wanted to say hi and that I'm thankful to have found what appears to be a very supportive little corner of the internet.\n\nOne question --- I know everyone is different, but for those of you who had a D&amp;C (or MVA), how long did it take for your bleeding to taper off? I had minor spotting for the first two days and thought I was off the hook, then on day 3 had a few hours of intense cramping / passing clots  (there's no such thing as TMI here, right?). Since then it's settled to something along the lines of a light or medium period with very light cramping. Can I expect it to continue tapering back down now, do you think? Is it bad that bleeding didn't start until a couple of days after the procedure? I haven't had any signs of infection or bleeding of the amount they said was dangerous, so I'm assuming this is all within the range of normal...\n\nI appreciate any thoughts you're able to offer. \n", "stickied": false, "subreddit": "ttcafterloss", "subreddit_id": "t5_34scd", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Intro and D&amp;C question (TW: MC)", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/ttcafterloss/comments/3j5456/intro_and_dc_question_tw_mc/"}, {"author": "raviyoylas", "author_created_utc": 1429052996, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_text": null, "author_fullname": "t2_mwye4", "created_utc": 1441063644, "domain": "self.ttcafterloss", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/ttcafterloss/comments/3j5dj1/wondering_why_i_miscarried/", "gilded": 0, "id": "3j5dj1", "is_self": true, "link_flair_css_class": "question", "link_flair_text": "Question", "media_embed": {}, "num_comments": 14, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/ttcafterloss/comments/3j5dj1/wondering_why_i_miscarried/", "retrieved_on": 1443155485, "score": 15, "secure_media_embed": {}, "selftext": "This was my first miscarriage. Of course my doc said it's very common, something was wrong from conception, nothing caused it other than the egg n sperm didn't go right together. I know that is likely but I can't help but wonder if it was something else.\nBefore my mc I had been to the doctor several times trying to figure out why I am so weak and fatigued all the time. My thyroids been tested, my sugar, and I was tested for pcos a couple years ago. Sometimes after I eat, I get nauseous. My heart races at rest, feel even weaker. I've read this may be reactive hypoglycemia. I am otherwise healthy, no drugs or smoking.\nAnyways when I got pregnant the weakness and fatigue was much more extreme. I have one child, 10 yrs ago, no problems at all. I felt nothing like I did during that pregnancy. If I exerted the smallest amount of energy I felt like passing out, sometimes shaking. I was also extremely thirsty. I drank water all day long and got up throughout the night to drink. I was drinking over a gallon a day. My doc just said to keep my sugar up. I wonder if those symptoms meant something else was wrong? Also before I got pregnant I had been taking spironolactone, quit around the time I got pregnant or shortly after. I wonder if this may have contributed? I feel like I need to fix myself before trying again, but I don't know what to fix. any advice please?

Turns out it was a partial molar with triploidy. Anyone else have experience with this? For a full molar, they recommend waiting 1 year to TTC. For a partial, they have been recommending 6 months of HCG monitoring before TTC. From reading, I guess my risk of having this are higher because of age and previous miscarriages. The curious part of me wonders how many of these go undiagnosed. A lot of people miscarry. Most of them do not have the POCs sent in for pathology - I have only had one of three sent for pathology. They are just told to wait a cycle or two and try again. The cautious side of me is terrified of tempting fate and getting cancer from TTC. My new OB is super smart and forward thinking, she says the new literature for partial molars gauges waiting to TTC based on how quickly your HCG drops. I would love to hear your experiences about TTC after partial molar pregnancies.\nEDIT:  The testing was done by microarray at Progenity. My understanding is that all Partial Molars are Triploidy but not all Triploidy are Partial Molars.  My doc insisted that they are one in the same.  Is there a way to tell them apart?

I took it out for the one week period allowance, had my period the first day it was out, and had sex the evening my period ended. I then realized my prescription was out of refills so made an appointment with a local ob/gyn. \n\nI went in about 8 days after I'd had sex and had my exam and he gave me a referral to a dermatologist to have a mole removed from very near my crotch. He also wanted to schedule an ultrasound and tests with me to actually confirm a PCOS diagnosis from 5 years prior where the diagnosing doctor did zero tests.\n\nHe left the room to schedule the ultrasound and came back in a few minutes later, gently took the referral he'd given me from my hand, and told me I was pregnant. I didn't believe him. I thought he'd accidentally tested the wrong urine. He told me that he'd verified the positive himself and sent me immediately for a blood test and attempted dating scan.\n\nFrom there on was kind of a blur. I had at least 3 more ultrasounds over the next few weeks, and 3-4 more blood draws, and two more doctor's visits. I'd told the guy, cried on the phone to my mom and dad, told my roommate and my best friend for moral support, and most of my other friends because secrets were hard to keep. My car broke down on the way back from the next ultrasound appointment and I was luckily able to buy the guy's old car off him right away.\n\nI knew emotionally without even thinking about it that I didn't want to end it, though I've always been pro-choice. I still at least tried to think about it logically but ended up deciding I couldn't possibly go through with it. The guy was super supportive, though we weren't technically dating. We started calling it Cricket, between us. Everyone was supportive, though my mom had a very brief freak out and told me that I couldn't have an elective termination and that she'd raise the baby (2000 miles away from me) if I didn't want it.\n\nThen things started looking bad. My levels were not quite doubling like they should. They were over 2000 and the technician expected to be able to see something on the ultrasound, but all they ever found was the corpus luteum cyst.\n\nMy incredibly sensitive and kind young doctor called me in on Wednesday, October 1st, after I'd had three weeks to get used to being pregnant and expecting a child, and told me it was ectopic. He didn't know exactly where it was so he'd have to do a laparotomy to find it. I was scheduled for surgery the next morning.\n\nIt was gut wrenching. I actually went back to work and worked the rest of the day just to keep my mind off it. I then went home, took a pregnancy test (that stupidly came up negative, making me cry even more) and cried myself to sleep.\n\nI went in the next day and had the operation. That cyst they kept seeing turned out to be hiding the pregnancy. It had started to rupture my tube and they couldn't save it. I never even had any pain and honestly would have only just started to realize my period might be late.\n\nI hated myself afterwards. I had been pregnant, and *I gave permission* to the doctors to remove that pregnancy. I thought the pain killers they gave me as causing me to have suicidal thoughts but it may have been plain old traumatic depression. It took me a really long time to get back to normal. I ended up moving 1000 miles away a year later just to get away from the memories. It did finally help the guy and I end our incredibly toxic pseudo-relationship and move on to actually being just friends.\n\nIt took until about this time last year for me to even consider trying to have a child. I've always been way too terrified of going through that again because I know I won't survive it next time. I still am, but the fear is outweighed by the possibility of it not happening.\n\nI actually talked to the guy last night. We both used to play an online game and we both quit years ago. He apparently picked it back up casually a few weeks ago and I randomly decided last night to start playing. The timing of it is all too jarring. I logged off after talking to him to go have sex with my new, amazing SO in an attempt at a new pregnancy. I don't really know how to deal.\n\nI never post here because I don't really feel like I belong. My first pregnancy was unplanned, and unwanted until it actually happened. I feel like that makes my loss less than those of most of you ladies. But there are times like these when I can't really handle it on my own. I need support from those who have been there and who understand. ", "stickied": false, "subreddit": "ttcafterloss", "subreddit_id": "t5_34scd", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Anniversaries suck.

Could use some advice. \n\nFor those who haven't been following my relationship saga, husband and I were trying for a couple of months to conceive (husband reluctantly but agreeable) before MIL came for a visit.  Since then, DH stated that if we continue to try for a child, it will be against his desires, and he will suffer from severe psychological distress if we conceive and have another child.  At the time, I decided we should stop until this is clarified, because it would be better for me to regret not having a child than him to regret *having* a child.\n\nClearly we are going to go into counseling of some kind.  But my question is this.\n\nWould I be a heartless bitch if I asked him to keep trying for the next month or two because of the timing of what would be a theoretically perfect maternity leave?\n\nI'm 32 (birthday is in April).  It took us 14 months to get pregnant with my first.  (Only once with the second, but that was random methinks.)  A big part of my job is school consultation work.  If I got pregnant this month, assuming the pregnancy went to term, maternity leave would perfectly hit summer vacation.  If I got pregnant the following month, it would hit two months of summer vacation.  If I don't try for at least these two months, I think the regret would be overwhelming.\n\nHe has a baseline anxiety disorder, and he is still grieving our losses.  I really understand and appreciate that, and I want to respect it.  And early childhood with our son was really REALLY hard on him, and he is scared of going through that again.  And he needs to process that, and process his fears.  And it would be beneficial for me to process my desire for a larger family and to explore that more thoroughly.  I get that.  \n\nBut...that's a long process, and time is against us.  And these two months particularly are the two months I have been foolishly thinking about for over a year.  This was the time I have wanted to try for since before I was even last pregnant.  I'm not sure I can survive the indefinite nature of waiting for something that may never happen, if my husband is not willing to confront his cognitive distortions.  \n\nAnd it is hard for me to decide what to do because my husband, who I love dearly, has a tendency to flip back and forth between stances.  I can't trust that his position at one moment will be his position in the next moment, though I really do believe he will always be reluctant because he gets overwhelmed by the concept of change and transition, even desired change and transition.

I told my parents about my miscarriage tonight and they left an hour ago or so. I was chatting with my sister and I got a notification that a friend commented on my recent post. I was confused, because I hadn't posted on FB in awhile so I looked at the comment. It was in regards to my \"positive pregnancy test.\" \n\nSome **genius** app decided it would be a great time to take an \"online pregnancy test\" for me and tell me and every one of my friends that I'm *pregnant* with triplets. Complete with a beautiful ultrasound of healthy babies.* \n\n*Three days after my miscarriage.* \n\n**Without my consent or knowledge.**\n\nWhat in the actual fuck just happened?\n\n\nSo I suggest you all go to your app allowances and revoke these 'cute quiz' apps from being allowed to post. Unfortunately, I acted very quickly in my anger. Not only did I not catch what app posted it but I revoked access from everything so quickly, I can't remember the name of the ONE app that had permission to post on my page. (I sometimes like to see the results of quizzes but don't want them to post to my page so most everything is set to 'only me.')\n\nHope everyone has a better weekend than I'm having night. Excuse my typos and formatting. I'm practically seeing red right now.
