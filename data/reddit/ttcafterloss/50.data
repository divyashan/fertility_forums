I wrote it the night before my D&amp;C, which was Monday. I wanted to lovingly express my grief while looking toward a brighter future. I reread it often.\n\nI wanted you to live longer, so very much longer. You were born from a sperm and an egg that met through your father's and my love for each other. To our sorrow, you did not have the ability to grow much beyond burrowing into my womb, triggering what would have been your first home to begin to form. You died shortly after that, right as we realized that we had made you, and were thrilling at the thought of you growing bigger and bigger until we could finally meet you.\n\nWhen we thought we would have our first chance to see you, you were already gone. We waited patiently, hoping you just needed a little more time to grow, but you had long dissolved into your surroundings. We grieve your passing terribly, and we wish with all our hearts that you had been able to keep growing. But we also love you just as you were, and we thank you for your presence in our lives. You gave us a lot of joy.\n\nTomorrow I will have the remnants of what would have been your first home removed from my body, which has already begun to collapse in your absence. It will hurt, but I will heal, and space will be made in my womb for a new beginning. We hope that one day a sibling of yours will burrow into my womb, trigger a new home, and grow bigger and bigger until we finally meet them, just as we dreamed of meeting you. In a way, we will finally meet you then too. You will be part of them, because you are part of your father and me, as they will be, and because you inhabited the space that forms their first home... but most of all, because you came from our love and our dreams, as they will, and where I now realize you have returned.\n\nGood-bye, my darling, and thank you again.

Scheduled septum resection surgery. Got pregnant by accident before surgery (just my motherfucking luck), miscarried again as expected because of the septum. Septum was finally removed in May. Conceived again in September, everything going perfect during weekly ultrasounds from 6-9 weeks. We'd never made it that far so we were finally full of hope.\n\nNIPT showed normal results. 12 week NT scan today. No heartbeat. Baby girl measured 9 weeks. We are confused and heartbroken. \n\nMy RE called me right away when she heard the news and she promised to do extended research and talk to her network of experts to find out what, if anything, she can try next for us. I appreciate having her on our team. I feel like I've been tested for everything though, I can't imagine what is left. I am hypothyroid but it is well managed and has been for 15 years.\n\nAll I heard was success story after success story from women who had their septum removed after multiple losses and went on to have healthy babies without any issues.

It'd be a huge help to those who want to know what to expect) To any new user: don't EVER allow your doctor to push a D&amp;C back weeks, it's not right nor is it safe. But here's my story. \n\nYou're told the anticipation is worse than the proceedure. And that is true. (You guys were right!!! Again lol) By the time the nurse came to do my IV I was in tears. When the anesthesiologist came back each time to talk I was in tears again. I was terrified something horrible would happen, no matter the reassurance my anxiety PEAKED. The guy joked that my response is normal, he has that effect on all women. Once he realized I was still pretty upset, he gave me trodol. Drug wise, that did not really relax me. I just felt sedated. Too sedated to cry so that's a win. Told my mom I'll be done soon and wheeled into the OR. I was instructed to get into the surgery bed, which was more like a table. The best way to describe next was literally like a pit crew. Everyone had a different job and they were all really nice to me and each other. They all seemed like they were great friends. \n\nI was then strapped down and told to lay flat. One nurse put a mask over my face and told me to inhale deeply, then cough. At the same time, another nurse put something else in my IV, and this BURNED. It burned and hurt. Not severe pain, but enough to make me cry out. I started to freak out a little but was assured it was normal and it suddenly went dark. I woke up with a sore throat, swollen lip, and pain on a scale of 4, maybe 4.5. They gave me benadryl in case and mentioned I may have bitten my lip instead of it being allergies. Quick mirror check informed me that yes, I indeed chomped on my lip. Was given fentanyl for pain. I was pretty out of it, but grabbed onto the information that they got the little piece out, most was gone already due to my bleeding the last couple of days. I scarfed graham crackers and cranberry juice to make myself pee so I left pretty quickly,  via wheelchair as my legs didn't work \ud83d\ude02 Follow up is in 2 weeks. Usual spiel of no sex, tampons, or douches. Got some chick-fil-a on the way home, grabbed a nap, and here I am. My throat is still sore (normal) and I am feeling weak in the knees, but bleeding is light and so is the pain. You guys have all my love and gratitude. I read every pm and comment all the way up to being wheeled into surgery. God bless you guys. Seriously \u2764\n\n**To those past, present, and future who will read this:** I leave this last part here because like me, and those here, when you learn you have to get a D&amp;C, you want to know what to expect, the stories of those who went through it, and to know you're not alone. Take it from this girl who was terrified...and take it from the lovely ladies who shared here as well. You'll be okay. I'm so sorry for loss, I'm truly so sorry. Take it one step at a time, one day at a time. Grieve on your schedule alone, and no one else's.

We had only known I was pregnant for 2 weeks before it was over, talk about emotional rollercoaster.  I stopped bleeding yesterday and asked the OB and she gave us the all clear to start having sex again.  Well after a crazy day, which involved a flat tire that was unnecessarily hard to change and a very busy and long work day, I figured a good romp session would end the day on a good note.

I feel betrayed by my own body for giving me false hope, I feel so sad that I would have been 4 months pregnant right now, and I feel guilty for not reacting like this when we lost our pregnancy before.

I've had very extensive testing for APS and a long list of genetic clotting disorders - nothing.\n\nMy doctors (high risk ob/gyn and a maternal/fetal specialist) have suggested trying lovenox for future pregnancies, especially if this baby is chromosomally normal.

In May we had an empty sack loss at 6w4d. We've got a 3.5 year old, pregnancy was text book until high Bp at 38 weeks. My progesterone fell quickly this time from 14 to 8 in 2 days around week 5. All 3 conceptions were quick, the losses were both first try. So at least I know that he makes sperms that can swim, and I'm ovulating when I think I am at around 19 days.\n\nWe haven't done any testing because the obgyn assured us it was just a fluke last time. But I can't try again until I know something. I don't know what testing to ask for. I just want to rule somethings out, or ideally find a cause so I know our chances. Will an obgyn do it, or do I have to see a reproductive endocrinologist? I see people saying that they had a hard time getting testing until 3 losses, which is heartbreaking and not something I feel like I can do.\n\nI feel like there are so many women here who have been through such longer and more painful struggles, which makes me feel guilty for feeling so lost. I am doing emotionally better than last time because I knew that there was a good chance of a repeat and decided not to have hope. I know that is cold, but I don't feel equipped to go through that level of mourning again. I have to keep going, and if I had felt this loss like the last one, I don't know how I could do that. \n\nWhere do I start?", "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "ttcafterloss", "subreddit_id": "t5_34scd", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Loss #2 and not sure what to do next", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/ttcafterloss/comments/7covbe/loss_2_and_not_sure_what_to_do_next/"}, {"author": "MISTRESSshake", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_text": null, "brand_safe": false, "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1510596098, "domain": "google.com", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/ttcafterloss/comments/7cowi8/49ers_marquise_goodwin_makes_heartbreaking/", "id": "7cowi8", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_self": false, "is_video": false, "locked": false, "num_comments": 7, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/ttcafterloss/comments/7cowi8/49ers_marquise_goodwin_makes_heartbreaking/", "pinned": false, "post_hint": "link", "preview": {"enabled": false, "images": [{"id": "KoCFxwUWNs-173TLs4Xjj87iYe5Qo73MkcjZAvJuAAQ", "resolutions": [{"height": 60, "url": "https://i.redditmedia.com/Td7dRuNHZHWw5hUSv0yxnMsTKNcJz4p3aouIZJ6CuxY.jpg?fit=crop&amp;crop=faces%2Centropy&amp;arh=2&amp;w=108&amp;s=2bb8c7aacc00dc614a069ba8a609bd27", "width": 108}, {"height": 121, "url": "https://i.redditmedia.com/Td7dRuNHZHWw5hUSv0yxnMsTKNcJz4p3aouIZJ6CuxY.jpg?fit=crop&amp;crop=faces%2Centropy&amp;arh=2&amp;w=216&amp;s=8f7cc0ce7c1c3423e26f952cb4af3951", "width": 216}, {"height": 180, "url": "https://i.redditmedia.com/Td7dRuNHZHWw5hUSv0yxnMsTKNcJz4p3aouIZJ6CuxY.jpg?fit=crop&amp;crop=faces%2Centropy&amp;arh=2&amp;w=320&amp;s=e04ed546182487a84bf54d1079af2e39", "width": 320}, {"height": 360, "url": "https://i.redditmedia.com/Td7dRuNHZHWw5hUSv0yxnMsTKNcJz4p3aouIZJ6CuxY.jpg?fit=crop&amp;crop=faces%2Centropy&amp;arh=2&amp;w=640&amp;s=bf071e85ba883a59c2b058a67f5e70c3", "width": 640}, {"height": 540, "url": "https://i.redditmedia.com/Td7dRuNHZHWw5hUSv0yxnMsTKNcJz4p3aouIZJ6CuxY.jpg?fit=crop&amp;crop=faces%2Centropy&amp;arh=2&amp;w=960&amp;s=a71e3c11ab7794b4dab2d35c3116b1bb", "width": 960}], "source": {"height": 576, "url": "https://i.redditmedia.com/Td7dRuNHZHWw5hUSv0yxnMsTKNcJz4p3aouIZJ6CuxY.jpg?s=d00035670d0c6da154d2f8192bf62e61", "width": 1024}, "variants": {}}]}, "retrieved_on": 1510674112, "score": 26, "selftext": "", "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "ttcafterloss", "subreddit_id": "t5_34scd", "thumbnail": "https://b.thumbs.redditmedia.com/jpy2LChBUIjB2hlh6KuC5hSada8cwJYiuJ9r4OS8w_o.jpg", "thumbnail_height": 78, "thumbnail_width": 140, "title": "49ers\u2019 Marquise Goodwin makes heartbreaking announcement about infant son\u2019s death", "url": "https://www.google.com/amp/ftw.usatoday.com/2017/11/marquise-goodwin-49ers-touchdown-celebration-son-baby-infant-death-announcement-giants-nfl/amp"}, {"author": "joygirl007", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_text": null, "brand_safe": false, "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1510598479, "domain": "self.ttcafterloss", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/ttcafterloss/comments/7cp732/first_day_back_at_work/", "id": "7cp732", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "locked": false, "num_comments": 4, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/ttcafterloss/comments/7cp732/first_day_back_at_work/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1510676599, "score": 4, "selftext": "10 days post-D&amp;C for our second loss. \n\nToday is hard.

Kind of calm and productive. It's rainy and cold but I was like meh! Finally some winter weather. I watched Mindhunter and snuggled with my cat and dog in bed. \n\nCame to work and just got fucking hamstringed (hamstrung?). I had appealed for a promotion which was denied after four months, they didn't recognize my second bachelors despite me sending them two separate transcripts, and I missed one dimension out of eight (you need all eight to get promoted). Then I got a verbal warning about putting my vacation time in before I left. I really just forgot, honestly, I'm busy at work. But the next time I'll be written up. \n\nHaven't heard anything about the interviews I went for. I'm trying to make a lateral move to day shift because, on evening shift, I am only at home with my husband two nights a week and basically it's a hi/bye situation every morning. Can't do that without a promotion, because I lose the incentive money for working off-shifts.  \n\nOh and I got a patient with shingles (I'm a nurse). I'm like I can't even protest, because I'm not pregnant. I just laughed, once, bitterly. Shingles is not a concern for me, because I'm not pregnant despite my best efforts for almost two years. \n\nStill ok with my decision to sit this cycle out. I'm mentally, physically, and emotionally tired. The build up and let down every month is just too much.

I wish I was in an alternate reality where I was working until the last possible second to save my vacation and sick time before going out, looking forward to taking our new baby to Thanksgiving and Christmas at other people's houses. \n\nThank you for listening to / reading all of this. I don't get support from anyone else, and my husband is not emotional about significant dates like I am.  It seems like everyone forgot that I was ever pregnant, and it's the only thing I can think about today especially. You guys are great and supportive and I'm sorry that we all have to be here. \n\nTLDR: due date, managed fine until 4pm and now want to crawl in a hole and die.

I have PCOS, and since switching to keto I ovulated for the first time in well over a year (closer to 18 months) of trying. We were over the moon, and so happy that a diet change was all it took for us to finally have an opportunity to conceive. My husband unfortunately had some issues with the pressure of the situation, so we had to resort to a turkey-baster up my hoo-ha to get the days we needed, but we still did it!\n\nAbout 10DPO I was testing like a madwoman and had some really random results. I'd get *really faint positives*, but not with all of the tests we had. Then all of a sudden at 12DPO it was like the gates of hell unleashed and I had the heaviest period I've ever had in my entire life (and I once had my period for literally 8 months straight). I was going through an Ultra sized tampon once an hour for about 48 hours straight. \n\nI just honestly thought I was pregnant. I kept telling my husband that I just knew I was pregnant and that it was definitely finally happening. Then it just wasn't. I felt insane because I kept telling myself that it was early and maybe the Shining elevator scene in my pants was just \"implantation bleeding.\" \n\nI found out when I went to the bathroom right before I had to walk/run to my class (I work full-time and am in graduate school). I basically burst into tears and then immediately called my RE to get a hysteroscopy with HSG scheduled for my next cycle (which will be tomorrow). \n\nI was a fucking wreck and barely held it together sitting in class for two hours. I got out of class and texted my mom, \"Procedure scheduled for Tuesday. Unsuccessful cycle.\" Then she called me and fucking *yelled* at me for being \"ungrateful for ovulating.\" She said that I needed to be happy I ovulated and not crying that I wasn't pregnant. Then she mentioned my Brother and Sister-in-Law and how she went through something similar and had to wait a \"long time\" and thought they were infertile. I told her I remembered because I ALSO was trying to have a baby back then. Now they have a one year-old and I'm getting fucking catheterized while my husband jerks off in the next room. By the way - they only had to try for six months. \n\nI don't know. I just feel crazy for thinking it was a chemical pregnancy. Could that cause a heavier period? My period came on CD23, which is completely out of the ordinary. I just don't know if I belong here. I'm so heartbroken that my body failed me (yet again), and now I have to have an invasive and painful procedure tomorrow instead of being 3 weeks pregnant. \n\nI'm sorry if this is all over the place. I just needed to get this out.

I have a friend, we are not very close and only chat in a group text setting. She lives across the country. Since I lost the baby last week, I have asked for space and I have not been replying to most messages beyond saying thank you.\n\nThis friend has sent me several texts which have started to come off as more for her benefit than mine... self indulgent, like convincing herself she is doing the right thing by constantly messaging me. I don't know if she wants to just get the details or if she is just not understanding my request for boundaries, but I am at the point of being really angry about it. I want to be left alone. She knows I have had 4 losses before this one. I asked that no one send anything, and everyone including my family has respected my wishes.\n\nI think I may be holding a grudge because she said in my presence before (a group text message) \"I can't believe I'm becoming a mom!\" when she brought a dog home. I had 4 miscarriages under my belt and that comment was beyond irritating. She also complains a lot about babies in public saying things like, \"Your baby is not that important\" which just made me want to put a wedge between us (that comment was super recent).\n\nI sent her a thank you after her first condolence text but she's sent more texts, and my good friend has reached out to her to say please give me space. I found out yesterday she sent me a care package of products that I don't even use (she works for the brand). I am beyond annoyed that she is not respecting my boundaries to be left alone, and I feel like sending me a box of shit is a weird way of forcing my hand to speak to her. \n\nI realize that I am in the thick of the anger stage of grief, and this grief vulture is exacerbating that. But I don't know if I should say something, send a simple thank you, or ignore it. TBH I don't even want to open the box. I am just really annoyed that it feels like she's dumping her burden onto me. Her need to \"be there for me\" when I've asked for the opposite is a burden that should not be mine.\n\nUPDATE: she texted me again tonight saying she is thinking of me and wants to keep letting me know that \ud83d\ude44 and to let her know if she is being intrusive. I replied saying I\u2019d like space and to be left alone. That\u2019s the final warning, next time (if there is one) I am going to block.\n\nI\u2019ll also be ignoring the care package.

The first six months were very laid back, very much a Not Trying/Not Preventing situation. Since then we've been making a concerted effort to predict my fertile window. A few months ago we started to get some investigations going with semen analysis for him and blood tests for me. We were referred to a fertility specialist.\n\n\nWe went from the angst of a fertility consult one week, to the joy of a prenatal consult the next, to the dismay of a loss the week after that.\n\n\nHalloween was rough for me this year. After an awful morning learning that I was no longer pregnant, I managed to take an afternoon nap on the couch. I woke up to the sound of cheerful children on the doorstep, trick-or-treating. They heard me get up, and became excited that someone was home. I couldn't face them. I made my husband open the door and hand out candy. Later, I saw a woman cradling a baby to her chest. When I realised it was a real baby, and not a costume, I burst into tears.\n\n\nI thought that I was unusually aware of parents with prams after we started trying to conceive. But now, after experiencing an early miscarriage, I feel *painfully* aware of every pregnant woman, stroller, and pram that I pass by. I'm sure it's just me, but it feels like there are more babies around than ever.\n\n\n", "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "ttcafterloss", "subreddit_id": "t5_34scd", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Intro Post: Worst.

I guess I officially belong in the \"loss group\", and was encouraged to post here when ready from some lovely ladies over at BabyBumps. \n\nI'll start by introducing myself. I'm a 22 y/o female who resides in Ontario, Canada. My partner is a 30 y/o Male and we were expecting our first. A little boy. I had a  TFMR on Friday, Nov 17th at 20 weeks. Here is my story leading up to this..\n\nAt 15 weeks (Oct 13th) I went for a keepsake ultrasound to find out the gender of our baby. The ultrasound went well and seeing him move around was amazing. Not even 30 minutes after my ultrasound they called me to inform me that they saw something on my scan that looked concerning. They couldn't give me much information as they are not allowed to give medical advice as they're a keepsake ultrasound office, not a medical office and encouraged me to speak to my OB. Of course, I freaked out but called my OB and my OB said he would see me at my next appointment, which was a week away. \n\nOn Oct 25th, I went to my OB appointment. Babies heart beat sounded good so I tried to convince myself that everything would be *just fine*. My OB looked at my scans and didn't seem too concerned, but said he would schedule me for a medical ultrasound anyways. \n\nOn Oct 27th I had my medical ultrasound. At first the hospital had no clue why I was there, so I had to explain the situation. The woman doing my scan was nice, but I freaked out when she asked me if I had the down syndrome scan done at 12 weeks. I said no, because I had opted out of it. (I guess I was a little naive and thought that nothing could happen to me because I am young...and my mom had me at 31 and had no tests done and I turned out just fine so my baby should, too). I asked if I should be concerned and she tried to calm me down, but it didn't work. After that appointment I was a mess because something just didn't feel *right*. \n\nOn Nov 1st my OB called me and asked me to come to his office. The whole ride there I was paranoid and panicked, but my SO tried to keep me calm and told me just to be optimistic. When we arrived at his office he told us he had our medical scans and it appears that the baby either has Gastroschisis or an Omphalocele and would most likely need surgery after birth. However, he was sending me to McMaster to get a detailed ultrasound done and a second opinion. I felt *crushed* after the appointment but tried to remain strong. I tried to avoid doing any research on the topic...but of course I did and found out that the worst case scenario would be that my baby had an Omphalocele with other anomalies and could possibly have Trisomy 18 or 13. After finding out that information something inside of me just told me to prepare for the worst case scenario but I was unsure why. \n\nOn Nov 6th, we had our appointment at McMaster. The day started with an Ultrasound and then would follow up by speaking to a genetic counsellor and meeting with a doctor. When I went into my ultrasound appointment, they said I was there for my anatomy scan. I was slightly confused and told them I was referred because the baby either had Gastroschisis or an Omphalocele but she said her sheet said I was also there for an anatomy scan. My anatomy scan took over 2 hours...and at that point I knew something was not right. They kept leaving the room and coming back to get more images, saying that either the baby was no cooperating or that the doctor needed more images. At this point, I was getting annoyed. \n\nAfter the ultrasound I went to speak with the genetic counsellor and got in pretty quickly...but that's when my world came crashing down.  My worst case scenario came true. She informed us that yes, the baby had an Omphalocele. She then kept asking if I knew anything about Trisomy 18 or Triploidy. I knew very minimal, so she explained that they're chromosomal defects and she was **very concerned** for my baby. I was 18 + 4 when I went to that appointment, but the baby was the size of a 15 week old. In addition to the Omphalocele, he had a abdominal wall defect. She was very concerned that I would either miscarry, or he would pass after birth. Then the doctor came in with more bad news. His bones were measuring small. The one arm was missing a bone completely, the other had all the bones but they were very, very small. His kidneys were small, his bladder didn't appear to be working properly. His jaw was very small and he kept hyper extending his neck backward which is very unusual (and I noticed it on all the ultrasounds, including the 15 week keepsake one). He kept curving his hands inward and they also noticed a heart defect. They were also concerned about the blood flow from the placenta to the baby, as it wasn't passing as well as it should. \n\nAt that moment, I knew exactly what was going to happen. I knew that I was going to terminate for medical reasons. I could not go through waiting for him to pass, or having him pass after birth. It would be too hard on me. The genetic counsellor kept pushing for me to do amnio, but I didn't want to if there was no way for me to save him. \n\nI cried, a lot. The genetic counsellor referred me to London Health Sciences to have the procedure done. I waited almost two weeks to see anyone, and in that time I was able to accept that I wasn't going to have my baby anymore...but it was at that time that he decided to kick and move a lot and I cried harder. How could something so wiggly and so active have so much going against him?\n\nOn Nov 16th I met with a social worker at London hospital and then I met with the doctor who would be doing my procedure. My doctor was amazing. I honestly could not have asked for a better person to be on my team. She helped calm my fears as much as she could and answered all of my questions. She also said she could send some of the tissues from the placenta and fetus away for testing if I wanted to, and we agreed to do it. \n\nThe laminaria rod insertions were very uncomfortable, but what broke my heart was when I had to do the Digoxin to stop his heart. I felt like the worst human being ever for having to do that. I sobbed, and the nurse in the room held my hand. After that I had to have 8 laminaria rods inserted and pretty much went through labour pains the rest of the night. \n\nMy procedure on the 17th went very smooth. I'm healing well physically with minor pain...but the emotional pain is *unreal*.\n\nWe got his foot prints done and I'm so glad we did...but I cannot stop crying. I feel like I've failed my baby...my family...my partner. He's been as helpful and comforting as he can, but I know he hates seeing me in pain. \n\nI didn't know it was going to be possible to hurt this much, and miss something I never got the chance to know. I didn't really consider myself a mom...but I guess I was...and it hurts so bad. \n\nWe are going to try again in a couple of months, and honestly...that's the only thing that's keeping me going right now. I feel so alone, so empty...so *broken*. My eyelids are so incredibly swollen from crying, and I don't have any desire to go back to work. I'm supposed to go back on the 28th, but I don't think I'm going to be able to and I'm so afraid to tell them that I'm not ready. \n\nDoes the pain last this badly forever? Will it ever feel better? I lost my Father when I was 11 years old, and my Grandfather a few years ago...but this pain is so different. \n\nI just need some kind words right now... sorry this was so long, thank you if you've read the whole way through.

TBH I am desperate and in need of some semblance of control (which is impossible in this situation, I know I know). This weekend I read \"It Starts With The Egg\" and she recommends a fuckton of supplements and lifestyle changes, with research to back it up, to improve egg quality for people with issues like infertility or in my case recurrent miscarriage.\n\nObviously not knowing what caused this loss (NIPT had come back normal), I am so lost and confused. I realize it could have been a number of things related to being hypothyroid (which is managed so I dunno...) or some undetectable chromosomal issue, or just horrible luck. I am going to bring the list of supplements to my RE and ask if it's worth it to try something, *anything*, for a few months, to improve our chances of taking a baby home. \n\nI plan to make healthy changes anyway as I haven't been taking very good care of myself in recent months. Just curious if anyone has any experience, through the guidance of your doctor or just your intuition, with taking supplements, lifestyle changes such as removing toxins (plastic/BPA/pthalates), eating a healthier/slow carb diet, etc and had a positive outcome?

I'm so glad to have found this subreddit. No one else really understands these things.\n\nSo, I had a stillbirth this September, on my due date, with no indication until the day of. 9 months of prenatal visits (including one the day before) were perfectly normal. At 2am on my due date my water broke. I called the midwife at our birth center and she said if I wasn't contracting to try to get some sleep and come in in the morning. When we went in they couldn't find a heartbeat. I was transferred to the hospital where they induced me. What no one seems to understand is that labor and delivery of my stillborn daughter was more traumatic (to me) than the loss itself. I assume that no one wants to think about that part of the process. Not to minimize our loss. It's just that no one acknowledges that labor and delivery was the worst day of my life.\n\nI hated how many decisions had to be made that day, but we decided to do everything to find out why this happened. That meant blood samples from me, autopsy of baby, and chromosomal studies of baby. At ~4 weeks out they told us that they hadn't been able to do the chromosomal analysis because the sample was bad. That didn't bother me too much because everything else had come back normal. I made peace with the idea that this was a fluke. Pure bad luck. Something that would never happen again, especially since we have one healthy child. \n\nWell. Here we are 9 weeks out and the final autopsy report is finally in. The midwife called to tell us that the baby had a malformation in part of her brain. She doesn't know if that was the cause of the stillbirth. The medical director of the birth center (an OB) is going to talk to a pediatric neurologist and get back to us. So we wait. And everyone keeps saying how good it is that we might get an answer. No. I did not want this answer. I wanted the answer that I had before. The one that doesn't paralyze me in fear of another pregnancy. \n\nSee, I'm seeing a new OB now. She's closer to where we live now and I don't associate her with our stillbirth. I went to her for my 6 week follow up appointment. We told her that there was no obvious reason for the stillbirth. She was awesome. She told us that I am physically ready to try to conceive again and that some families find it better to wait and others find healing in trying again right away, that that part was completely up to us. \n\nSo, we've started trying and then we get this news. I still want to try, but I'm so scared of something bad happening again. \n\nSo, thanks for being here &lt;3", "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "ttcafterloss", "subreddit_id": "t5_34scd", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Intro (TW: stillbirth and LC)", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/ttcafterloss/comments/7ebzgd/intro_tw_stillbirth_and_lc/"}, {"author": "mamajt", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_text": "Eliza - 15w loss to Trisomy 18, 7/21/17", "brand_safe": false, "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1511214347, "domain": "self.ttcafterloss", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/ttcafterloss/comments/7ech4p/intro_postfeeling_pessimistic_15wk_loss_to/", "id": "7ech4p", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_css_class": "intro", "link_flair_text": "Intro", "locked": false, "num_comments": 8, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/ttcafterloss/comments/7ech4p/intro_postfeeling_pessimistic_15wk_loss_to/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1511289091, "score": 5, "selftext": "I'm a thirty-six year old woman married to a woman. We long-distance co-parent with a married gay couple. In 2011 at the age of 30, I got pregnant with my first child in our 11th cycle trying. That pregnancy and delivery of our son was mostly normal. Nothing drastic to report. In January of 2017 we began trying again. In March we took a one month break and I was diagnosed with PCOS and put on Metformin. In April, on our third cycle, I got pregnant. We were overjoyed and ready to meet the baby who'd complete our family. Because I was 35 and OLD, we did the early Panorama test. With no genetic history of problems, we were basically just waiting to find out the baby's sex before we announced the pregnancy to the world. My morning sickness was just *delightful* but it reassured me that everything was going to be okay. I'd made it to the second trimester! Totally fine.\n\nOn July 6th, a day or two before I entered my 13th week, we received the results. We had a little baby girl, but she was at high risk for having Trisomy 18, which meant that - if positive - she was very unlikely to survive to her first birthday, let alone birth. We scheduled an amnio for late July, just after she turned 15 weeks. I remained in denial, but checked her heartbeat every evening and kept a spreadsheet of the numbers. On Friday, July 21st I had a strong desire to check her heartbeat in the morning and gave in. Still hanging in there.  That evening I couldn't find her. I texted my midwife and she met us at the ob/gyn clinic fifteen minutes later to do an ultrasound, which confirmed that our baby girl was gone, a day before 15 weeks. \n\nI don't have to fill in the rest - you all know what happened next.  The heartache, the grief, the depression, the appointments, the looks, the whispers, the self-loathing. I've already dealt with clinical depression my entire life, and the post-partum depression threw me into a despair I won't describe here. Luckily, I've been seeing a therapist for a long time.\n\nWe decided to try again, and because I'm just *ancient*, we had to begin to try quickly. None of us were emotionally ready, but I'm the youngest of all four parents, and I'm already considered \"up there\" in age. Our first cycle for Baby 3.0 was in early October the weekend of my 36th birthday. I actually had some unusual mild cramping, dark brown spotting, then all that went away and I had Extreme Fatigue (the likes of which I hadn't experienced since my first child, and I'd even put myself through grad school in the meantime) and my temps went up in a triphasic nature. Then Boom, period. I never even got a positive. But I'm positive something was there. My second cycle felt like every regular cycle I've had since I was thirteen. Nothing. I didn't even bother testing, and sure enough, I got my period.\n\nNow we're revving up for the third cycle, but I don't see it ever happening for us. We're all just too old and maybe at this point we're just tempting Fate. Why are we even bothering? All my friends have kids in high school and are so thrilled to be done having babies. A high school friend and my younger cousin just had (adorable) babies with Down Syndrome. I'm at the age where this sort of thing becomes a pretty big concern. Trisomies are very real. Can we afford another Trisomy baby? Is this all just a lot of heartbreak for nothing in the end anyway? When do we call it a day and just be happy with the living baby we have?  We're SO insanely lucky to have him. Maybe we're just pushing our luck. I don't know how I'll survive if this happens again.\n\n**TL;DR: I'm old, lost my second baby to T18 at 15 weeks, we're trying again and I'm wondering if it's even worth it or if we're just chasing a beautiful dream.**", "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "ttcafterloss", "subreddit_id": "t5_34scd", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Intro Post/Feeling Pessimistic (15wk loss to Trisomy 18).", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/ttcafterloss/comments/7ech4p/intro_postfeeling_pessimistic_15wk_loss_to/"}, {"author": "Metsgal", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_text": null, "brand_safe": false, "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1511230553, "domain": "self.ttcafterloss", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/ttcafterloss/comments/7eecs6/question_for_you_all/", "id": "7eecs6", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "locked": false, "num_comments": 2, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/ttcafterloss/comments/7eecs6/question_for_you_all/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1511303668, "score": 2, "selftext": "Ok so I don\u2019t know all the acronyms that come up when I google this so I figured I\u2019d come here.

I miscarried that baby at 7.5 weeks on Dec 3rd. \n\nIt took 6 months to get pregnant again. \n\nWe found out I was pregnant with twins around 6.5 weeks. Due to complications with placenta previa and oligohydramnios, I went into preterm labor at 19w5d and delivered (via c section) my beautiful son and daughter twins at 20 weeks exactly. They passed shortly after birth due to extreme prematurity. \n\nI'm struggling today. Being pregnant exactly a year ago makes this Thanksgiving hard. Going through a second holiday under very different circumstances is hard.  After a year, we have loved and lost three babies.  And I miss my twins the most. \n\nOn the other side of this is forging ahead. This is the TTC after loss subreddit after all.  \n\nI have always healed from other grief or sadness by looking at the next step.  I still want a baby in my arms. I still want to fill the cribs upstairs in the unfinished nursery.  But, because I had an emergency c section with a classical cut, I have to wait 6-12 months before attempting another pregnancy. I can deal with the fact that all subsequent pregnancies will end in c sections. Fine. \n\nBut I cannot move on with my life and fill the empty, bereaved, childless hole in my heart until at least April. So I sit here in limbo. \n\nI started tracking my cycles again on a few apps so I could get an idea of my cycles for when that 6 months finally passed. And I'm ovulating this weekend over the holiday.  Every cycle since Aug 2016 has included inseminations when I've ovulated (we are a lesbian couple. Heavy logistics went into timing insemination with our known donor 1000 miles away).   Now I've grown attached to every egg that doesn't have a chance over the next 6 months. Every chance of potential that I won't have the opportunity to bring to life.  No inseminations this time.

[trigger warning: I give the details of our traumatic birth experience] \n\nWe lost our son at 4 days old in July due to complications during birth. Everything during the pregnancy was great until about 35 weeks when I developed gestational hypertension...still nothing to really worry about since the test for pre-eclampsia came back negative. However, my OB decided to induce at 37 weeks. I was in labor for 36 hours before my OB decided that he became \"stuck\" in my pelvis and had turned sideways. I was in the operating room for a C-section within the hour (again, still nothing to worry about except that I was terrified of the surgery). This is where things started to take a turn for the absolute worse. There were probably 20 doctors and nurses in the room, along with the NICU team.  I was so out of it I didn't really realize until after what was going on.  He was so wedged in my pelvis that my OB had to push his head out from my pelvis. He was taken directly to the NICU with my husband and I didn't get to see him again for almost 8 hours.  The next day was a whirlwind and I naively thought he would pull through. He had suffered a stroke during delivery and started having seizures every 5 minutes or so. On 2nd full day in the NICU we had the dreaded closed-door meeting with the team of physicians and were told that the damage was too extensive and he would not make it. They told us this was such a rare case and most of the time babies don't suffer that much damage (I want to ease others' fears, they told us this was \"one in a million\") We spent the next 2 days in the NICU where we held him, bathed him, changed him, and gave him oral care. He passed away when he was 4 days old in our arms. I think I was in a complete daze for awhile, not knowing what to do and say as I was also recovering from an unplanned c-section too. \n\nWe are now approaching the 6 month mark, which is when we decided we'd start trying again. My thoughts are so consumed with my son and with the desire to have more children.  I'm filled with many emotions and fears but I also know we're meant to be parents.  I started tracking my cycle last month and feel back to my normal self, physically so now I'm just trying to stay positive as we TTC. Everyone (in-laws) have been asking a lot about when we're going to start TTC again, even asking specifically about when I'm ovulating.  I know they just want us to have a child and they'll be so excited and supportive, but it really puts the pressure on as they'll be waiting and asking constantly.\n\nSorry for the long post, hopefully it makes sense.

My RE is wonderful and she is trying so hard to do everything in her power to help us.\n\nToday we discussed every possible option we could exhaust going forward. She is testing my husband's sperm (for quality this time), she is testing my thyroid antibodies instead of just TSH which was/is well-managed, doing a triple check next month on my septum tissue that was removed in May, and she said go ahead and take the laundry list of supplements I inquired about (Ubiquinol CoQ10, vitamin E, vitamin C, extra folate, selenium). She told me I can focus on losing weight which I already had planned on since I am at least 30 lbs overweight. I want to start an autoimmune focused diet since I have Hashimoto's.\n\nThe saddest part was that she's most concerned it isn't a chromosomal issue, as every test on our fetuses and our own carrier screenings have shown normal results. She said that because I have Hashimoto's, my inability to carry a pregnancy full term (so far) could be something that medicine can't cure... and if I keep losing pregnancies, using IVF with a gestational carrier might be our only option for biological children. She wasn't pushy or even recommending it at this time, just making us aware of the option.\n\nI completely broke down hearing that. I am so sad that this is where we are. For the first time I can feel a real disconnect between me and my husband over our struggles to have a baby and it breaks my heart. I just needed to put that somewhere.
