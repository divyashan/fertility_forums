I feel at my wits end. I am feeling like my case has been rare and no one can relate. \n\nOn August 23rd I was diagnosed with an ectopic. The previous month, I had bleeding and I assumed it was my period, so I was about 8 weeks along when the ectopic was discovered. \n\nI was immediately given MTX, and at first, everything was going as expected. My HCG level dropped each week, until the end of September when it started to plateau. At the end of September, my HCG was at 13 and only dropped slightly for 3 weeks in a row. On Halloween, I was given another dose of MTX in hopes that it would move things along, but it didn\u2019t work this time. Since then, my HCG level has only moved down to 7.4 as of two days ago. I am losing my mind. That\u2019s two months of it barely budging. \n\nI had an ultrasound done, and everything looks normal. There is no more mass, nothing in my uterus. My doctors believe I am actually experiencing \u201cphantom HCG\u201d, where low levels of HCG show up in blood but doesn\u2019t actually exist. They had me do a urine test, which was negative. But of course it was, since my HCG is only at 7.4. \n\nBecause of that, they had me start Provera yesterday. I am to take it for 10 days in hopes of it kickstarting my period and resetting my system. But I am freaked out that this is a bad idea. I wish I had resisted a little more, but I already took one dose so it seems bad to stop.

I\u2019ve had some complications after the loss (extensive bleeding) but after some diagnostics and meds we are almost in the clear to start trying again. It\u2019s been a long road for us. With the holidays here it\u2019s been even more of a challenge. My sister in law is currently pregnant with her second and is due a few days after when I was supposed to. I did not handle her news well and when I apologized for my behavior she shot me while I was down and accused me of not being supportive even though I apologized. So we currently aren\u2019t on speaking terms with her. My brother and his wife are celebrating their first holiday season with their baby but have decided they would rather do everything with her family this year.  On top of that my boss decided to threaten to fire me with no solid evidence that I deserved that (it\u2019s a very long story but trust me the only thing I could be accused of is being disengaged at work...nothing that warrants firing).

The doctor diagnosed me with PCOS. I don't have high androgens (my testosterone is 35) and I'm very thin (110, 5'6\"), but I had about 20 follicles on each ovary and no periods, so I got the diagnosis. I was very depressed at the time of the diagnosis due to the miscarriage and not getting pregnant again - I struggled emotionally for a long time.\n\nAfter a round of clomid that ended up with me ovulating while my husband was out of town, I got frustrated and just decided to take a break and try to get back to \"normal\" emotionally before diving into any treatments again. I had also been taking Ovasitol, Berberine, Vitamin D, Vitamin C, Prenatals, NAC, a probiotic, cinnamon, chromium and a whole host of other supplements... I just felt defeated and stepped away.\n\nThen, in September, I started taking black cohosh the first 8 days of my period. I had a 29 day cycle in September, a 34 day cycle in October and a 31 day cycle in November. I am in awe of my body and I can't believe this is happening. I got a blood test done at a \"self order\" laboratory facility 7 days after I thought I ovulated in November and had progesterone over 10...\n\nSo does this mean that I am really ovulating?? It has been 3 months and I haven't gotten pregnant, so maybe not... but maybe I am? Did black cohosh save me?\n\nAlso, a friend of mine said maybe i should try to NOT take black cohosh and see if my body will have a cycle on its own without it... but I don't think I want to lose a month of trying if I don't ovulate without it. Any thoughts??\n\nI don't know how this is happening for me. I feel really lucky, but also really scared. Could this be real? Could I be able to get pregnant on my own again?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAs other background, prior to my miscarriage I had two elective abortions when I was younger. I'm not proud, but I say this to mean that I've gotten pregnant 3x in my life now. But the last year was filled with a miscarriage at 12 weeks followed by 10 months of not getting a period and not getting pregnant again...

I'm assuming that doesn't count the first period I get in 4-6 weeks. I'd really like to try ASAP because I'm AMA at age 36 1/2 right now, but I\"m also trying to be physically and emotionally ready to be pregnant again.

We got pregnant in September and we were so excited. It worked! We were going to start a family and it was on my perfect timeline. In June 2020, we would celebrate our 2nd wedding anniversary, my 32nd birthday, and the birth of our new baby.\n\nI found out I had probably had a MMC on November 1 at my first OBGYN visit. After an awful weekend of trips to urgent care, several transvaginal ultrasounds, and too much drawn blood, the MMC was confirmed and I had a D&amp;C on November 7. At my follow up appointment it was confirmed that there were no complications and, while the doctor recommended waiting a cycle to TTC for dating purposes, she said it was OK to try before my next cycle since we had already had unprotected sex (aka \u201cnot not trying\u201d).\n\nWell, so much for not not trying...I had been tracking my cycles for years while on my non-hormonal IUD and on Thanksgiving I realized I was getting ready to ovulate. We had sex all weekend and now I\u2019m sitting here waiting, terrified that it won\u2019t work - terrified that  it will work and it won\u2019t be viable. This fucking sucks.

I had complained of cramps and was told by my doctor that I needed to get accustomed to some pain as I was nearing my due date. That following Tuesday we had our weekly appointment.

My son Kaden was delivered after induction the following night on 11/27/2019 - a date that will mean so much to me. The silence after delivery was traumatizing. I remembering days earlier being so afraid of delivery - only to get in this moment and be so numb with depression it was a blur. I was able to see my baby boy - who turned out to weight 3pounds. (A fact that was never noted to me until now). The feeling of leaving the hospital empty handed is a feeling ill always remember. Me and my husband cried all the way home - and climbed in bed where we held each other for days. I am just now a week exact able to get out of bed.

I\u2019ll go through all that...again...I\u2019m scared. I know it\u2019s normal but I\u2019m scared. I don\u2019t know what to think.

We do this in order to keep this place a safe space for all who are dealing with the grief of a loss that is fresh.\n\nThe TTC Daily is a very supportive and welcoming place for people who are working through the grief of their loss and either waiting to try again or beginning the process of trying again. It's a good place to ask questions about TTC and the particular difficulties of TTC again after loss, it's a great place to vent about things going on in your life, it's a great place to get support when you're struggling to conceive again. It's a great home for anyone who has experienced loss that is NOT currently pregnant. Pregnant members are welcome to comment in this thread but must leave all mention of current pregnancies out of this thread.\n\nThe Weekly Results and Limbo Thread is for members to announce their results of TTC for the week (both negative and positive results). Users in early pregnancy or in pregnancy limbo may post about those things here, too.\n\nStandalone posts are only for TTC and grief-related topics. This is a good place to link to articles or studies that may be interesting to our members, a place to post standalone rants, a place to post standalone TTC questions, and a place to give and receive support. There should be no standalone posts regarding pregnancies and no comments regarding pregnancy in this part of the sub either.\n\nFor our Alumni, those who have conceived after loss, we ask that you move to r/PregnancyAfterLoss \\-- a very supportive and welcoming sub for questions about a current pregnancy and for vents and rants about pregnancy after loss. The PAL sub is also the place to celebrate any pregnancy milestones when pregnant after loss. Basically, if you are pregnant after loss, r/PregnancyAfterLoss is a great home for you. TTC members are welcome to post and comment here as well to keep up with their friends, should they choose to.\n\nLastly, if you are referring someone here from another sub, please make sure to let them know to post any pregnancy-related topics in the PAL sub. \n\nI know everyone here wants the same things - to end up with a baby in their arms after experiencing a loss - and we have members at many different stages of this journey. I know it isn't anyone's intent to trigger fellow members, but when the topics are so close to the heart it can and does happen. By following these rules we are striving to create a safe space for all of these members.

TW: loss \n\nI have had two losses this year and I\u2019m not sure where to go from here. \n\nMy first loss was a complete, natural miscarriage in January at 6w. My second loss was a MMC at 10w with a D&amp;E. We did not do any testing.\n\nMy cycles are super irregular (always have been, whether it was due to birth control, before that being underweight/hyperthyroid, other unknown reasons.) \n\nI recently went to my endocrinologist and my thyroid levels are all normal. Did other hormonal testing and things looked fine there too. \n\nI just don\u2019t know what to do next. I\u2019m finally at the place mentally where I\u2019m wanting to try again whereas a month ago the thought made me incredibly anxious and wasn\u2019t even an option in my mind. \n\nMy midwife said she could refer me to an RE, but I know the ones she would refer me to are all men at our hospital, and I\u2019d prefer a woman. I don\u2019t know anyone that has experience with any RE\u2019s in my area so I can\u2019t ask anyone personally for a recommendation. I don\u2019t want to just go to a fertility clinic and they empty my wallet, you know? I\u2019m also super, super terrified to have an HSG and other invasive exams.\n\nI don\u2019t want to just get pregnant on my own. I don\u2019t want to have a third loss. I want to do everything in my power to avoid this next time. Should I go to my OBGYN and just ask for different testing? Or should I go to an RE? \n\nI feel like it\u2019s all in my hands and no one is telling me what to do one way or the other. My endocrinologist was not concerned at all about my two losses, she acted like they were both a fluke because they were both so early. I don\u2019t want to have a third to prove this isn\u2019t a fluke. \n\nThanks in advance for any advice!", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "steward_reports": [], "stickied": false, "subreddit": "ttcafterloss", "subreddit_id": "t5_34scd", "subreddit_subscribers": 6472, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "What\u2019s next?", "total_awards_received": 0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/ttcafterloss/comments/e664bv/whats_next/"}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "amugglestruggle", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_3olscdu5", "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_premium": false, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1575502829, "domain": "self.ttcafterloss", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/ttcafterloss/comments/e686qw/i_feel_like_im_setting_myself_up_for_heartbreak/", "gildings": {}, "id": "e686qw", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 2, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/ttcafterloss/comments/e686qw/i_feel_like_im_setting_myself_up_for_heartbreak/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1575502830, "score": 1, "selftext": "Hi everyone!\n\nI posted a little while ago about starting my first round of Clomid.

I never met with the ob I intended to see \u2014 i ultimately met with the woman who was on call performing the procedure that day. So during my 2 weeks follow up, she ultimately agrees to do some testing on me. Turns out I likely have a thyroid condition. She also asked me to come in for a sonohysogram during my recent period. They ultimately couldn\u2019t get me in, and called me as late as humanly possible (aka 4pm on Tuesday before thanksgiving \u2014 which meant I had 2 days, including thanksgiving, to get the testing) to tell me that so I couldn\u2019t go somewhere else. I talk to my provider and she says that they were gonna just look for uterine abnormalities. Guess what doctor \u2014 you\u2019re in luck! I had an MRI completed at another practice 1 year ago looking at the same stuff. They told me everything was fine so this should be sufficient. She is basically like \u201cgreat \u2014 send it over. I\u2019ll take a look at it and call you back with my thoughts soon.\u201d I sent it over to her last Tuesday.  I take a quick look at the progress note and see a potential diagnosis that my old doctor never even mentioned. \u201cHm. That\u2019s funny\u2014 they never mentioned it.. let me google. Holy shit everything listed it all about infertility and miscarriages with this new diagnosis. Holy fuck I am freaking out. Can\u2019t wait to hear from my doctor about this so I can discuss treatment options!\u201d No response on wed. \u201cThat\u2019s cool \u2014 I\u2019ll just drive myself crazy and be miserable until after thanksgiving. Surely she\u2019ll put me out of my misery on Monday.\u201d I call at the end of the day on Monday to ask whether someone can call to discuss the results. \u201cNo big deal Bountiful, you\u2019re doctor isn\u2019t here right now but I\u2019ll make a note for her and ask that she call you. She\u2019ll reach out tomorrow.\u201d I write her a follow up message on my patient portal explaining my concerns after reading research and up to date articles. I thank her for baring with me - that I\u2019m having a hard time and just would prefer to talk to her than keep torturing myself with internet searches. Tuesday comes and goes and I hear absolutely nothing. I wake up on Wednesday and I am literally gushing blood and my blood pressure is 80/50. I feel like I\u2019m going to fall over and can barely eat anything. I call the office to tell them I\u2019m concerned considering I had my first post miscarriage period like 2 weeks ago... this can\u2019t be normal \u2014 there are tons of clots and it\u2019s literally all Over me and looks like a dark black. \u201cOh bountiful, that\u2019s normal\u201d..... I took plan b in early November bc I wanted to be medicated for my thyroid issue before getting pregnant again\u2014 very hard decision.... \u201cbut we suggest you go to another doctor bc we can\u2019t help you with your blood pressure issue. Consider going to the er.\u201d Me: \u201cGreat thanks for your help.. also can you ask my doctor to call? I\u2019ve been waiting for Over a week to discuss this other diagnosis and I\u2019m starting to lose my mind over it.\u201d Her: \u201cOh bountiful she\u2019s not here today \u2014 she will be back tomorrow.\u201d Me: \u201cOk well, she isn\u2019t even the doctor i wanted to see for my ob care. Dr xyz is. Can you ask her or literally anyone to look and just tell me their impressions?\u201d Her: \u201cSure, I\u2019ll make them aware and someone will call you later.\u201d  Me: \u201cthank you so much \u2014 I really appreciate it.\u201d\n\n30 hours later and I\u2019m still waiting for this damn call.

I would have been 9 weeks but baby stopped growing at 6 weeks.\nOnce finding out I wanted to see if I would start bleeding naturally but ended up having a D&amp;C one week after the terrible news.\nAfter the initial loss and depression we began looking to the positives... hey, at least we know we can actually conceive....\nSo since everything has happened we have continued to try. I have been living a healthy lifestyle... prenatal vitamins (elavit and him on menivit), avoiding alcohol, going to the gym, healthy sleep cycle etc and have returned back to a 28 day cycle.  \nThe problem is that it\u2019s taken the fun out of \u2018making a baby\u2019. It\u2019s become so mechanical... oh I\u2019m ovulating, today\u2019s the chance etc... and becoming a chore and bringing so much tension  with no success. It\u2019s so disappointing when my period starts each month. \nWe really want to add a special little person into our special little family but how do we go back to bringing someone into our family out of love not a routine mechanical job? My husband never seems to \u2018be in the mood\u2019 anymore since doing the tests each month and taking the fun/spontaneity out of the equation. \nAny advice on how to move past this and bring some joy into our making a baby life would be greatly appreciated", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "steward_reports": [], "stickied": false, "subreddit": "ttcafterloss", "subreddit_id": "t5_34scd", "subreddit_subscribers": 6473, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "It\u2019s gotten so mechanical", "total_awards_received": 0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/ttcafterloss/comments/e6xguw/its_gotten_so_mechanical/"}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "ttc123454", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_4ek4sf4o", "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_premium": false, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1575636823, "domain": "self.ttcafterloss", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/ttcafterloss/comments/e6ye0r/psa_to_intake_employees_at_blood_clinics/", "gildings": {}, "id": "e6ye0r", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_css_class": "vent", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_template_id": "e465bc62-beec-11e4-a607-22000b6b9cb2", "link_flair_text": "Vent", "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 36, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/ttcafterloss/comments/e6ye0r/psa_to_intake_employees_at_blood_clinics/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1575636825, "score": 1, "selftext": "When you see \u201cHCG Quant\u201d on an intake form, DON\u2019T ASK ME IF I\u2019M HAVING A BABY because I\u2019m forced to say \u201cnot anymore, why do you ask?\u201d While holding back tears, in a very full, very quiet public space.

I work for a big company, but my team is very small and I don't have a ton of interaction with lots of people, so I spend a lot of time at my desk and not socializing much.  It's also more my personality to keep to myself so this is kind of on me and maybe it would sting more if I got asked too much, but lately I find myself just wanting to tell people or talk about it.  No one at my work knows that I had a miscarriage this summer.  My previous manager left our team before I got pregnant, and I never told my other teammates because I work part-time so most of my time off for the miscarriage was when I was out of work anyway so it just never became a necessity to tell them.  Yes, it's painful to tell people that we haven't been able to add to our family in the time-frame or manner we hoped, but it's becoming harder to not talk about it in some ways.  Even my friends and family that do know about it don't ask too much anymore, either about the MC or the TTC again aspect, aside from my husband and mom.  Maybe they're trying to be sensitive, or maybe they think I should be over it by now.  But I'm not over it, and I do want to talk about it because it's all I ever think about anymore.

they've done absolutely nothing wrong, so i feel bad when i start getting upset instead of being happy for them, it's all very confusing. \n\nhas anyone else had to deal with this similar situation? i don't want to compare, but it's so hard not to considering we were all in the same place. i do have great support from other friends, especially my single girlfriends who aren't at the baby place yet. and i know i shouldn't, but i feel guilty that i cant just be simply happy for my pregnant friends. any reassurance in any direction would be appreciated &lt;3", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "steward_reports": [], "stickied": false, "subreddit": "ttcafterloss", "subreddit_id": "t5_34scd", "subreddit_subscribers": 6473, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "6.5 weeks post ectopic and tube loss, starting to TTC again. emotionally ready?", "total_awards_received": 0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/ttcafterloss/comments/e74mli/65_weeks_post_ectopic_and_tube_loss_starting_to/"}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "BountifulRomskal", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_template_id": "8b677c92-711f-11e4-b63c-12313b0b807d", "author_flair_text": "mmc 7/10/19, blighted ovum 10/17/19 - d&e x2", "author_flair_text_color": "dark", "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_445ti2n1", "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_premium": false, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1575675769, "domain": "self.ttcafterloss", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/ttcafterloss/comments/e76l4i/update_to_post_yesterday_could_really_use_some/", "gildings": {}, "id": "e76l4i", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 4, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/ttcafterloss/comments/e76l4i/update_to_post_yesterday_could_really_use_some/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1575675771, "score": 1, "selftext": "If you didn\u2019t read my post yesterday here it is (I don\u2019t know how to link to it on mobile I\u2019m sorry).

One was mmc with d and e in July at 8 (should have been 10) weeks. Second was blighted ovum with second d and e in October. I never met with the ob I intended to see \u2014 i ultimately met with the woman who was on call performing the procedure that day. So during my 2 weeks follow up, she ultimately agrees to do some testing on me. Turns out I likely have a thyroid condition. She also asked me to come in for a sonohysogram during my recent period. They ultimately couldn\u2019t get me in, and called me as late as humanly possible (aka 4pm on Tuesday before thanksgiving \u2014 which meant I had 2 days, including thanksgiving, to get the testing) to tell me that so I couldn\u2019t go somewhere else. I talk to my provider and she says that they were gonna just look for uterine abnormalities. Guess what doctor \u2014 you\u2019re in luck! I had an MRI completed at another practice 1 year ago looking at the same stuff. They told me everything was fine so this should be sufficient. She is basically like \u201cgreat \u2014 send it over. I\u2019ll take a look at it and call you back with my thoughts soon.\u201d I sent it over to her last Tuesday.  I take a quick look at the progress note and see a potential diagnosis that my old doctor never even mentioned. \u201cHm. That\u2019s funny\u2014 they never mentioned it.. let me google. Holy shit everything listed it all about infertility and miscarriages with this new diagnosis. Holy fuck I am freaking out. Can\u2019t wait to hear from my doctor about this so I can discuss treatment options!\u201d No response on wed. \u201cThat\u2019s cool \u2014 I\u2019ll just drive myself crazy and be miserable until after thanksgiving. Surely she\u2019ll put me out of my misery on Monday.\u201d I call at the end of the day on Monday to ask whether someone can call to discuss the results. \u201cNo big deal Bountiful, you\u2019re doctor isn\u2019t here right now but I\u2019ll make a note for her and ask that she call you. She\u2019ll reach out tomorrow.\u201d I write her a follow up message on my patient portal explaining my concerns after reading research and up to date articles. I thank her for baring with me - that I\u2019m having a hard time and just would prefer to talk to her than keep torturing myself with internet searches. Tuesday comes and goes and I hear absolutely nothing. I wake up on Wednesday and I am literally gushing blood and my blood pressure is 80/50. I feel like I\u2019m going to fall over and can barely eat anything. I call the office to tell them I\u2019m concerned considering I had my first post miscarriage period like 2 weeks ago... this can\u2019t be normal \u2014 there are tons of clots and it\u2019s literally all Over me and looks like a dark black. \u201cOh bountiful, that\u2019s normal\u201d..... I took plan b in early November bc I wanted to be medicated for my thyroid issue before getting pregnant again\u2014 very hard decision.... \u201cbut we suggest you go to another doctor bc we can\u2019t help you with your blood pressure issue. Consider going to the er.\u201d Me: \u201cGreat thanks for your help.. also can you ask my doctor to call? I\u2019ve been waiting for Over a week to discuss this other diagnosis and I\u2019m starting to lose my mind over it.\u201d Her: \u201cOh bountiful she\u2019s not here today \u2014 she will be back tomorrow.\u201d Me: \u201cOk well, she isn\u2019t even the doctor i wanted to see for my ob care. Dr xyz is. Can you ask her or literally anyone to look and just tell me their impressions?\u201d Her: \u201cSure, I\u2019ll make them aware and someone will call you later.\u201d  Me: \u201cthank you so much \u2014 I really appreciate it.\u201d\n\n30 hours later and I\u2019m still waiting for this damn call.  Is this appropriate?? I work in healthcare and need to find coverage if I cannot answer my existing patients questions within 24 hours. The medical doctors where I work have 2 days to respond to secure messages. It has literally been 9 days since I sent the mri results and I am going Crazy. She doesn\u2019t even have to do anything \u2014 all she has to do is tell\nMe what the diagnosis means and what my treatment options are. Now I feel like a pain in the ass patient since I\u2019ve been calling the office and feel too anxious to call again. Am I being unreasonable? Is this bad patient care or are my expectations to high since I treat my own patients with dignity and respect and recognize urgency when I hear it? Jeeeez.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014-\nAfter hearing from a few of you, talking to my pcp at an annual visit, and considering the fact that I would never treat my own patients this way, I decided to call the office today to understand what is happening. I call and request to speak with the nurse manager, explaining what is happening and that I want to understand why I never heard back from the doctor. I\u2019m transferred to the nurse line. I start sobbing explaining the story and emphasize that I just want to understand why my doctor won\u2019t call me back ... that I feel such a lack of control over my body and I just need someone to help me or give me direction and I don\u2019t understand what I\u2019ve done wrong for this to be happening. I was for 25 minutes and am put on hold. The nurse comes back and explains that my doctor was here this week but that she went on vacation!!!! They reached her and learned ther she was very busy this week (not to say I\u2019m not important of course) but that I clearly have a lot of questions and keep calling their office looking for help, so my doctor would like me to come in to discuss these results and doesn\u2019t feel comfortable discussing it over the phone. I first inquire about their protocol for for coverage when their staff is out. I am required to develop a contingency plan for my own patients if I\u2019m out of the office \u2014 is this what I can expect if I come here and ultimately have a baby? She explains that no... my doctor just knows my medical history and has been working with me, so other doctors won\u2019t be able to help me. I explain that I already said to two other nurses that I actually wanted to meet with the other doctors who I initially joined the practice for\u2014 I\u2019d like to talk to them instead of this woman. They said I need to wait and meet with this person first, but she will not meet with me for 3 weeks!!!! I ask if it\u2019s standard care there where patients can\u2019t choose their own doctors and ultimately have to wait 1.5 weeks to hear from their providers. They said no, of course not. The whole thing was incredibly upsetting and I felt so shamed for calling in and asking questions about my care. I have been so depressed the past few weeks and this is just throwing me over the edge. I just feel like absolute crap that this happened and now I feel like a terrible pain in the ass\u2014 that I have label on me at this practice. I also feel so upset that they hear how upset I am and worried I feel, and the earliest they can see me is 3 weeks? I feel like that says a lot about. Where should I go from here?

We got lucky on the first cycle. Unfortunately I only found out the day before I found out it was ectopic. I kind of knew it. I had a positive test on (what I thought was) CD10, so I figured it wasn't going to be a good situation and didn't allow myself to get my hopes up. Honestly, for the women who have a loss after weeks/months I can only imagine how devastating that must be. \n\nI couldn't get into the OB for 3 weeks, and I knew I would drive myself crazy waiting that long. The woman who made the appointment said \"so you're pregnant and you're bleeding?\" It sounded so bad when she said it like that.\n\nI went to urgent care. I went alone. I was afraid it would be fine and I'd have wasted my husband's time. I doubted myself, I was worried I would be the first time mom who overreacts at every little thing. I think we do this a lot as women. \n\nI wish I remembered the name of the urgent care doctor because I would like to write her a letter. She looked me in the eye and said we can't help you here, but you can't wait 3 weeks. It's too dangerous. You need to go to the ER today. I needed that validation so bad. She made me tell her which one I was going to, and she called ahead to tell them I was coming. \n\nI did okay dealing with the ER, the testing, the diagnosis, the treatment. I was actually relieved that I went alone. I needed it to be my decision, not our decision. Then came the consent form. I don't know why but the doctor made me read it out loud. The first line was \"I understand that I have an ectopic pregnancy that is not viable.\" I just broke down. The doctor asked why I was crying, not in a puzzled way but I think as a way of making sure I was okay. She pressed me for details. But I really didnt want to talk about it with her. I barely knew her. \n\nThe medicine came in a bag marked \"Cancer\" in big red letters. I was pretty numb by then. The nurse was very kind, with a kind voice. It hadn't hit me yet that that moment was going to kill my baby. I know logically that the pregnancy couldn't continue and would kill me if I didnt end it. I know it was a clump of cells, a yolk sac. I'm not pro-life. But this isn't a logical experience. Its visceral. \n\nI took the long weekend to deal with the physical pain and emotional grief. My husband and mom helped me so much. I took another hour or so of crying on a camping trip a couple weeks later when my betas went to zero and I was officially not pregnant anymore. And then I moved on. Or thought I did. \n\nWe went back to trying as soon as we could. I'm thankful for the TTC reddit community. I've learned so much, but also felt so supported, and I'm so happy to give support to other women. \n\nJust this past week though I finally broke down. It all came up, everything I'd been pushing down. My would-be due date is coming up. I was hoping if I was pregnant by then it wouldn't be so bad, but it looks like that's not happening. I made my first appointment with an RE and admit that I can't do it on my own. I had to write down all the medical details. It's the first time I had to check the \"have you ever been pregnant?\" box. I skipped Thanksgiving because my mom was sick and I could have been pregnant. I missed it for nothing. Then there's Christmas. I'd be 8 months pregnant. I wouldn't be able to fly to see my in-laws like we're planning. I'd be buying baby clothes and toys for my baby, not just my nieces.\n\nI know I need to feel the feelings. It sucks, but it's necessary. It's normal. I'm spending the weekend partly keeping busy and partly having down time to cry and grieve. And so here I am. Putting down all the details to a group of women that I hope will understand. \n\nI think we'll take a break from TTC this month. I've been clinging to hope for the future, but I think I need to deal the past for a little while.", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "steward_reports": [], "stickied": false, "subreddit": "ttcafterloss", "subreddit_id": "t5_34scd", "subreddit_subscribers": 6480, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Finally cracked [Ectopic]", "total_awards_received": 0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/ttcafterloss/comments/e7j6ho/finally_cracked_ectopic/"}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "Rebekahm17", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_4lotsi4u", "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_premium": false, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1575753947, "domain": "self.ttcafterloss", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/ttcafterloss/comments/e7k76q/worrying_about_conceiving_again/", "gildings": {}, "id": "e7k76q", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 13, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/ttcafterloss/comments/e7k76q/worrying_about_conceiving_again/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1575753951, "score": 1, "selftext": "I am new to this community, but I had been pretty involved in the miscarriage community after my missed miscarriage this last August.

But I feel like this must not count as a \u201cnormal\u201d period, so probably should take next month off as well (sigh).", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "steward_reports": [], "stickied": false, "subreddit": "ttcafterloss", "subreddit_id": "t5_34scd", "subreddit_subscribers": 6482, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Super light period after MC?", "total_awards_received": 0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/ttcafterloss/comments/e7kirl/super_light_period_after_mc/"}]}
