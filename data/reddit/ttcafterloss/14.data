We never saw it coming, and we don't know why my placenta was small. \n\nA few months ago, a perinatologist talked with us for nearly an hour and a half and we really like her, but her \"prognosis\" is that she feels like it was just a fluke. As she put it, sometimes seeds grow better than others. Same with babies. She said there is genetic testing that can give indicators for certain blood clotting disorders but that they cost $800, insurance doesn't cover the cost, and her game plan wouldn't change if I were found to be positive. That knowledge wouldn't change anything for me or future baby, according to her. Her game plan for the next pregnancy is ultrasounds every 4 weeks (every week after 32 weeks I think?) and one daily baby aspirin. If my next baby measures behind or isn't growing as expected, we will schedule an early induction. If they do grow as expected, we will decide if we want to induce at 37 weeks for anxiety purposes. So \"Plan A\" is to see this perinatologist plus my original Family Doctor OB for cooperative care. The perinatologist would be my Primary doctor and would deliver the baby (she's a really renowned doctor from the University of Washington). I am homozygous for the C677T MTHFR gene mutation and I will tell you that did not impress her one bit. As in, she says it's not related to why this happened.\n\nHowever, on Friday I'm seeing another doctor because I want to be thorough and I want to either hear the same story or hear some alternate possibilities. I'm also reconsidering doing the genetic test, just to have maximum information in front of us. \n\nDoes anyone have any advice or questions to ask this other doctor or my current one? Does anyone have experience with a similar story? \n\nUPDATE: the doctor was great. She mostly agreed with the others, but felt (as did I) that doing the bloodwork was prudent. So we are awaiting results. If something comes back positive, I may also add low dose heparin to my plan. Otherwise, just baby aspirin and a lot more monitoring.

My BFF strongly suggested I **don't** write to her since tone can get lost in the written word and suggested I message/text her and ask her to call me when she had a chance to talk. I did just this yesterday and was frustrated that she saw it and didn't respond. *I need to remind myself I don't respond to everything right away and I don't have a hungry newborn.* \n\nShe called this morning (literally minutes after I complained on the daily thread she hadn't yet) and we had a REALLY good talk. \n\n**First: My Loss**\n\nShe was really sympathetic about my loss and very supportive. She was a little sad that I hadn't told her earlier when she was pregnant and reminded me that I can talk to her about anything at any time. She said she will be ready to celebrate a baby whenever I am ready to try again and get pregnant. \n\n**Second: \"Real Kids\"**\n\nI then told her how her comments about our mutual friend (MF) not having real kids hurt me. I explained how far along MF was and that I needed a little time to cool off because it felt like a punch to the gut. Then SIL told me something I didn't know. Apparently, after her CP when she was very down she reached out to MF since she had experienced loss and MF posts A LOT about awareness of pregnancy and infant loss. She said MF responded once and then completely brushed her off and there was still a feeling of resentment. She said she was very hurt that MF posted so much about being there for people experiencing this grief and this disappeared when her own \"friend\" was going through something similar. She went on to say that her termination was a traumatic experience and the CP felt like a slap in the face and she tries not to think of them much and she didn't realize by denying her own feelings about them down that she would be discounting other people's pain.\n\n**Third: Yes. We Talked About the Cheesecake**\n\nI finally told her about my irrational anger about her insulting my cheesecake making skills. I told her that when she started suggesting recipes and techniques that I got upset because I *knew* the cheesecake was an experiment and when she said that it made me feel like **\"Oh! You're better at making cheesecake *and* babies!!\"** We had a good laugh and she reminded me that she is an only child, product of a single mother, and her communication skills are different than mine. She said that when she sees an opportunity for improvement she offers advice, it's how she's programmed and she forgets that it isn't always welcome. Knowing her mom is a classic narcissist (Most recently: We had to change the baby shower date because *she* didn't like it. Not couldn't go. Didn't like it. She did not help with *anything,* showed up almost an hour late, complained there were no forks for the buffet of finger foods, and didn't even thank me for hosting a shower for her daughter.) and I reminded myself how far she has come and how much she has grown in the 8 years I've known her. And then I thought about how much I've grown in 8 years and stopped, I don't need to think about how dumb I was. \n\n**Other Thoughts:**\n\nWe talked for a long time and I've completely forgiven her for the comments she made. I'm so glad I talked to her, I do love her, and I feel so much better about a lot of things. This has been weighing on me a lot heavier than I realized or let myself believe. I even discounted our relationship in my anger and that wasn't fair. \n\nSo... I guess I just want to remind everyone that it's okay to talk to people who have hurt you. They may not have realized they did anything wrong and they may have their own shit going on you didn't know about. If you love each other, it might feel better to talk.\n\nThank you to everyone who was mad with me when I wanted to be mad, who gave me support, and who encouraged me to talk to her. \n\nYou are all wonderful and I hope you have a great weekend.

What was your experience?  \n\nI was excited last cycle because I had used up the rest of my Wondfo OPK's and HPT's, which I had assumed was perfect because I was pregnant, right?  Right... just not for long.  I just got my new pack of OPK's and HPT's in the mail yesterday.  In an attempt to not waste any OPK's, I want to be sure I start using them at the right time (I had just gotten down the \"right time\" last cycle and now I have a cycle full of unknowns).  I'm nervous of being that weird one-off lady who O's super early this cycle and I'm going to miss it.  Do you recommend that I just start testing when I normally would for a normal cycle?

I am a grit your teeth and get on with it girl), I was getting a lot of viruses and migraines and I was having a really hard time at work - it was like I was losing my mind, which was harder than anything else. My hair also started thinning at my temples. I thought I was just burning out and saw no reason to talk to the GP about it.\n\n\nGP ran two sets of tests two weeks apart and booked an ultrasound. Ultrasound came back normal, hormones came back normal, most bloods came back normal but I had inflammation and elevated ANA levels. So off to the immunopathologist I go.\n\n\nHe did a full assessment, I told him about my pain, insomnia, thinning hair, migraines, viruses etc and he ran a whole heap of tests including a test for APS. All came back negative except for my ANA levels which he says are 'borderline high' and my inflammation levels which were 'somewhat high'. His diagnosis is fibromyalgia with no autoimmune disorder (like Lupus or APS).\n\n\nFibromyalgia is bang on the money now I have looked into it and I think I have been building up to it for a few years, its just the emotional stress of the CP's tipped me over the edge. But fibro as far as I can see, does not cause miscarriage.\n\n\nThat whole process was about 2 months long so after a 2 month break I am ready to get back into it, but now I am left wondering what to do next?

Most of the women in my life are pregnant without issue right now, so I'm kinda struggling to feel something other than completely alone.\nMy husband and I have been trying for our second baby since May. I got pregnant in August but just before I hit 5 weeks, I started bleeding and tests showed my HCG levels were only at 5.\n\nThe doctor I saw said there was no problem with trying again right away, so we did, and two cycles later got pregnant again. This time, the day before I hit 6 weeks I started bleeding, went to the hospital and learned that my HCG levels were in the 3-4 week range and although they could see a pregnancy with a transvaginal ultrasound, it was around the 4 week mark, too. My HCG dropped and the doctor said I could let my body take care of things on its own. It's been just over a week since then.\n\nThis second one is hitting me hard, and I feel like I'm grieving two losses at once. I know I am 'lucky' that both were early, but I really didn't think it would happen to me twice, and had completely let my guard down this time around. Every little thing is breaking my heart -- I thought I was doing better today, then stumbled across the prenatal appointment I had scheduled in my phone, had to delete it, and feel awful, now. I haven't been able to focus all day and have so much work on my to-do list that is sliding because I'm exhausted and sad but can't take sick time without losing money that we need. I'm so grateful to have my daughter, and my husband, but I know that there are pieces of me missing.\n\nAfter the first loss I wanted to jump right back into TTC and my husband did, too. I felt like I wouldn't be whole again until I was pregnant. Being pregnant the second time helped a lot with my bad feelings from the first loss, and now, I would really, really like to be pregnant again. But I'm way more scared, now. The 'it won't happen again' feeling is gone. \n\nThe doctor I saw (a resident at the ER) suggested taking a break, and threw 3-6 months out as a time frame though she said it was something various doctors would answer differently. I'm torn between throwing that out the window and just not trying, not preventing for the next little while, or taking extra time to deal with things. I know that getting pregnant again won't fix anything, emotionally, but I think I hate the feeling of endlessly waiting even more. And, if we have another loss, a third miscarriage allows for further testing through our health system and I would frankly rather get to that part sooner than later -- same for hitting one year of trying without success. \n\nI took a pregnancy test a few days ago and it was blank, so I'm guessing my HCG is somewhere back around the baseline. I didn't get any solid numbers from testing, all I know is that they weren't particularly high, and that they were dropping. Is it crazy to treat this like the first CP and jump back into things, albeit with less pressure than before? I know none of you are my doctors, but I'm just looking for some perspective. \n\nThank you for reading this giant wall of text, if you got all the way through. I'm sad that we are all here for similar reasons, but thankful for the support. &lt;3", "stickied": false, "subreddit": "ttcafterloss", "subreddit_id": "t5_34scd", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Introduction &amp; a question about trying again", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/ttcafterloss/comments/3qm2hk/introduction_a_question_about_trying_again/"}, {"author": "KanadaEh", "author_created_utc": 1437524543, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_text": null, "author_fullname": "t2_oz9ci", "created_utc": 1446066295, "domain": "self.ttcafterloss", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/ttcafterloss/comments/3qm3we/trigger_warning_what_do_miscarriage_pain_feel_like/", "gilded": 0, "id": "3qm3we", "is_self": true, "link_flair_css_class": "trigger", "link_flair_text": "Trigger", "locked": false, "media_embed": {}, "num_comments": 16, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/ttcafterloss/comments/3qm3we/trigger_warning_what_do_miscarriage_pain_feel_like/", "retrieved_on": 1450699675, "score": 4, "secure_media_embed": {}, "selftext": "I had a miscarriage in March.

Just a little, brownish - pretty much exactly what everything says implantation spotting looks like.  Spotting again yesterday, minimal, same color.  Urine pregnancy test this morning was negative, but I expected it to be.\n\nBut tonight, I'm getting a lot of cramping.  At baseline, I don't have cramps with menstruation.  A little more spotting, but still not like a period.  I shouldn't have my period until Friday, and historically I'm really regular.\n\nIt's just weird.  My body isn't working like it normally does.  Is my body trolling and just messing with me, getting my period a little early?  Is this something I need to be worried about?  Should I be peeing on sticks the next few days until I get a true period (hadn't planned to until Friday at the earliest)?\n\nI know it's stupid... I just kind of thought with the timing, that it was really implantation bleeding.  And my friend just announced her pregnancy.

I selected the place I am going to through approval from my insurance. She's nice enough and I'm comfortable with her but there are some issues. For starters she knows my story (6 pregnancy losses one recent. My biggest trigger is pregnancy) anytime I talk about my pregnancy or the possibility of being pregnant she says something about her pregnancies and how she would feel (she has 2 grown daughter and 1 grown son all have kids) she talks about her grandkids often. She lights up when she talks about these things. This is supposed to be MY safe place. I don't want to go in there and feel guilty about not wanting to hear about her kids/grandkids and their happiness. She also tells me stories about her aunt/friend/whoever that had a lot of pregnancy loss who went on to have healthy pregnancies. Yes I know that's possible I really don't want to hear about it. The most recent thing that I can't seem to get over is I asked for an appointment on December 7th she asked why that day I said it is my stillborn sons birthday (which we have talked about on many occasions she knows the date) then she went on to say oh the reason that date sounds familiar is its my daughter scheduled sonogram to find out what the sex is..... why why would she say that.... the main reason why I haven't dropped her yet is because I have been going to her for a while and I feel comfortable for the most part talking to her. She has also told me if there is ever anything she says that upsets/angers me to tell her and she won't bring it up again. I haven't done this it's hard for me to tell someone what they are doing that bothers me.

Anyways, now my doctor said that I'm high risk for cervical cancer and they found abnormal cells and doesn't want me to go through chemo and be pregnant so they want to rule out cancer first.  I'm freaked out.  All I can think of was that Lucas was my only chance to have a baby and it makes me incredibly sad.  I know I can adopt and all of that but since losing him its made me really want my own so much more.

I just had a D&amp;C last week (they used the term evacuation). No bleeding or pain really until the 6th day after where I just felt \"periody\" and then bled throughout the afternoon. Nothing today.&amp;nbsp;\n\n\n\nI'm struggling with the grief. This baby came for us just as we'd been through the rigors of fertility diagnostics in August. We'd gotten the all clear and aside from needing some thyroid meds (high antibodies but an ok thyroid, my fertility specialist said they would reduce our risk of miscarriage). Well we fell pregnant early Sept.&amp;nbsp;\n\n\n\nAll looked great until the 7 week scan where it looked liked a suspected blighted ovum. We went home, anxiously waited a week and at 8 weeks saw a heartbeat and a baby measuring 6&amp;3.&amp;nbsp;\n\n\n\nI knew my dates weren't out but tried to stay hopeful. At that stage we transferred to an obgyn and at what should of been 9 weeks we received news that the baby hadn't grown and there was no heartbeat. Unfortunately the obgyn was away the next week on leave, so he transferred us to yet *another* obgyn who at 10 weeks confirmed the baby was still at 6 weeks, no heartbeat and so a D&amp;C was performed the next day (a week ago today).&amp;nbsp;\n\n\n\nI am BROKEN mentally. At my age and given it took us 9 months (and a year off BC) to conceive I just can't help but feel like this is a big fat full stop to ever having a baby. I've seen my GP in conjunction with the obgyns etc and after trying valium to help me sleep, and now sleeping tablets for a short course (just to get me some rest - they aren't working though, I awake at 3am with nightmares), he's advocating for anti-depressants.&amp;nbsp;\n\n\n\nI see a therapist weekly. She's thinking yes to them too.&amp;nbsp;\n\n\n\nI just don't know?? She also advised a genetic blood test for MTFHR to see if my body is processing folic acid properly. She seems to feel that taking mega folic acid with the MTFHR gene = anxiety. It would mean adjusting to folinic acid I think? My GP wasn't very versed in it.&amp;nbsp;\n\n\n\nI guess I just want to touch base after lurking? I'm praying for my cycle to return so we can start TTC again. I only ever tracked via dates and EWCM (my cycle was clockwork at 27 days, I always spot before hand but fertility workup showed good progesterone so I was told that wasn't an issue).&amp;nbsp;\n\n\n\nBut now I think OPK sticks might help me feel a bit more on top of it? Maybe even the Sperm Meets Egg Plan.&amp;nbsp;\n\n\n\nMy GP / psych both think if I *do* get pregnant again I'll need medicating to cope with the 1st trimester anxiety.&amp;nbsp;\n\n\n\nI'm so confused right now and would appreciate anything anyone can offer in response. At 36, losing our first, I feel so alone. Our friends have all had their families. I met my husband at 33, married him at 34 and started off BC at 35 so it's not like I waited too long. I just had a crap marriage in my 20s, as did he. No prior kids for either of us.&amp;nbsp;\n\n\n\nSorry to ramble. Thank you for listening.&amp;nbsp;\n\nUPDATE: I saw my GP last night after work and decided to get a script. We talked at length about which medication would be suitable to me for now and weighed it all up. I filled the script and started this morning.&amp;nbsp;\n\n\nHe's seeing me weekly for a few weeks and has said if I start to turn a corner quickly we can conclude it was me and not the meds and view to simply stopping them a week in. If I need them longer, that too is ok. He very much has given me agency over how long I attempt them whilst gently advising that I'm spiralling and the anxiety cannot go on as is.&amp;nbsp;\n\n\nI see my therapist Wednesday and today I went for my first run in months. I'd had a head cold when I found out I was pregnant so had taken a week or so off my regular 5ks that keep me so balanced mentally. I stopped running out of fear as soon as I became pregnant. Today. I braved it. Tiny steps forward and a slow shuffle run but I did it.&amp;nbsp;\n\n\nI thank you all so much. As does my husband. He read the thread and is so grateful for the compassion and understanding. We'd been feeling really alone. Thank you for listening.
