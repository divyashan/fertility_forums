I knew it was coming because my ultrasound earlier that week didn\u2019t look good. Growth was a couple weeks behind and there was a weak heartbeat. \n\nI miscarried very early morning and was able to get into my OB\u2019s office where they performed an ultrasound. I had a small amount of retained tissue that was taken care of with a dose of misoprostol. \n\nI was told to wait 3 cycles before trying again. I did and got pregnant first cycle. My OB\u2019s office didn\u2019t want to do any beta testing and scheduled me for my first ultrasound at 8 weeks. I started spotting brown last week at 5+6 and was told not to worry about it. I started cramping very badly late Tuesday night and was told yesterday morning that they didn\u2019t need to do anything but that they\u2019d test my betas. I think an ultrasound would\u2019ve been better, but okay. I went in for beta testing and then miscarried about 6 hours later at 6+5. \n\nI knew what was happening because it\u2019s happened before. I knew the pain level was tolerable and the blood amount was normal and not worth going to the ER over if I could see my doctor this morning. I definitely passed tissue that was not clots, so it\u2019s pretty obvious what happened. \n\nThe OB nurse in charge of handling same day appointments treated me like crap and said I could get a follow up appointment in 2 weeks. Am I crazy or is that insane?! Isn\u2019t an ultrasound right now important to check for retained tissue or any kind of abnormality?! I told her what they did for my last miscarriage and she basically gaslighted me and said that that\u2019s not how they handle these situations. I was too upset to deal with her and so my husband called back and demanded the doctor call me personally like she did last time. \n\nWell, I never got any kind of call back from anybody and here I am going on nearly 24 hours after a traumatic event with little concern for my well-being. I am honestly furious. \n\nSo my first question is...is it necessary to get any kind of follow up for this miscarriage? I\u2019m not sure if the process was different last time because I was slightly further along. My bleeding and cramps have pretty much stopped so there\u2019s no imminent threat from that. I\u2019m mostly worried about getting an infection later and it affecting my future fertility. Should I start calling around tomorrow to see if any other doctors are willing to see me? I know it can take a while to see new patients, and I don\u2019t want to spend a fortune on an ER visit because my current doctor is a jerk. \n\nLastly...2 losses in a row plus me being 36...am I at a point where I can start getting extra screening now? Do I just need to start calling up reproductive endocrinologists or is there some kind of process I need to go through first? I\u2019m so lost and confused about what to do right now and am getting zero help from my current OB practice. I was counting on them to point me in the right direction, but it\u2019s obviously not going to happen.

Instead I\u2019m lighting a candle for him every night and I sit in front his urn and just cry. This is not what it was supposed to be, he didnt deserve this. He deserved to live his life.

I will never see him go to kindergarten or graduate , I will never see his first steps or play sports. I will never hear his sweet voice say mommy or have sing alongs with me. I will never see him grow up and have a life and kids of his own. He will forever be 33 weeks old. I already have all the pictures I will ever have of him, there won\u2019t be any new ones. I search for his smell in the 2 outfits we dressed him in that day but they have taken on the smell of the memory box the hospital gave me and no longer smell like him. I hate it. I hate it all. I just want him back. I hate I have all these empty dreams, I hate I have all these baby clothes he will never wear. I hate that I have all these baby things I\u2019ll never get to see him use.

I ordered four books off amazon, then went to the bookstore and bought three more. I did everything perfectly. I excercised every day, ate well, cut out everything I was supposed to.\n\nI'm an anxious person, so I was worried about miscarriage from the beginning. Everyone acted like everything was going fine, so of course it would be fine. At about 7 and a half weeks I started believing them. The riskiest time is 4 to 6 weeks which I had been past, so I was beginning to be very hopeful.\n\nOn Monday, July 16th I woke up and felt more tired than I ever had and my stomach hurt. Around 10:30 I had a tiny bit of blood. I freaked out and called my husband and he came home from work. My doctor said that unless it increased to just keep my ultrasound appointment for the next day and wait it out. Even though I was scared I was hoping I was just overreacting. People spot when they are pregnant. It's scary, but normal.\n\nA few hours later the bleeding increased and we were advised to go to the E.R. Everyone that we came into contact with at the E.R. was kind and compassionate and so supportive. They did a pelvic exam, some blood work and an ultrasound. When they brought me into the ultrasound I could hear a baby crying in the other room. My husband wasn't allowed in so he sat in the waiting room. The lady who did the ultrasound explained that she couldn't tell me anything so I needed to calm down becuase it was going to be hours before I got any results. I couldn't see the pictures, but I heard my baby's heart beat.\n\nFinally the doctor came in, he told us that we had a 50% chance of the baby surviving. You could tell on his face what side of the 50% we were going to end up on. They gave me a shot of rogam since I am o- to  help with future pregnancies and we went home to wait.\n\nThe next morning at around 5 am I started having bad stomach pains and the blood was beginning to contain tissue. We had our first ultrasound appointment already scheduled for 10:30, so they asked us to still come in to go over our options. I had been waiting for this day for so long.There was a lady with a baby and a little girl sitting next to us in the waiting room and I lost it.\n\nWe went in and they had us do a vaginal ultrasound. When we walked in I was crying and the nurse said \" Some women just bleed during pregnancy, you could be fine.\" Alex watched the screen but I didn't. The nurse told us that the baby didn't have a heart beat any longer. She left us to get dressed, but she left the picture on the screen.\n\nWhen people show you ultrasound pictures you act like it is cute, but everyone knows they look like little aliens. My baby didn't. She was perfect. \n\nThe nurse spoke to us and gave us our options. We could try to let it pass naturally or take cytotec to make it quicker. The nurse seemed against the cytotec, but the doctor recomended it, so we ended up taking it. We made an appointment for an ultrasound on Thursday to make sure that everything had passed so I didn't get an infection. They scheduled a D and C for me on Friday if I needed it.\n\nThe cytotec was terrible. The contractions were so painful. I don't know how they expect women to do this with just ibuprofen. The pain was so bad that i just screamed while Alex held my hand. After a few hours of pain I passed the majority of it. I will never forget what it felt like when the big pieces came out. I had a panic attack and passed out. Alex had to hold my head so I didn't hurt myself.

I am very nervous mostly about it affecting future pregnancies and about feeling them doing stuff in there. I don't know if anyone can offer positive stories. All I want to do is try again, my GP said she suggests waiting until first period after D&amp;C but that she has had patients get pregnant after the 2 week waiting period of no sex, and not get their period at all, and go on to have successful pregnancies.\n\nI am extremely healthy, young (27) and did everything right. I don't blame myself, but I worry this will happen again or I won't ever get a BFP again. In fact it is my biggest fear.

We wanted a second opinion since it seemed so abrupt with no warning and the doctor had terrible bedside manner (told us in the lobby of the hospital!).

Scheduled for a d/c the next week. \nThis is when all hell broke loose. During the d/c I lost 1/2 my blood, needed a blood transfusion and had to stay in the hospital for way longer than anticipated. So to add insult to injury regarding this loss, now have massive medical bills on top of it. \nDoctor said nothing seemed abnormal and was just a fluke. And gave us the go ahead to start again. This is the first month with the green light and I took a test the other day with a squinter of a double line. Cue excitement all over again. Now today, took another test.  Completely blank. 99% sure it was a CP.

My boyfriend and I miscarried at about 9weeks in November.  I was due July 4th, so this month has been exceptionally depressing but with every month I have a little glimmer of hope that it may be the time!  It\u2019s been a lot harder emotionally for a lot longer than I thought it would be, these posts help me to realize I\u2019m not alone and that therapy is a viable option.  I\u2019ve wanted to be a mom since I was a kid and that\u2019s the only thing in life I\u2019ve ever been 100% certain about.  After a fear of not being able to conceive and then loosing the first it\u2019s hard to keep my head up and be positive that although it\u2019s not happening now it should someday.  I do believe everything happens when it\u2019s supposed to and not always when I think they should but then when I see constant pregnancy announcements and invitations to baby showers, it\u2019s hard to not be envious.  This month was better than last month, emotionally, and my boyfriend keeps trying to understand my pain but remains positive which is helpful at times.  People keep saying it will happen when I least expect it but I don\u2019t know if I\u2019ll ever least expect it so does that mean years??!!  Who knows?

I'm asking for your non-medical-professional, personal experience or information if possible. Thanks in advance.\n\nSo my wife and I are experiencing a second miscarriage at the moment. First was an ectopic last year. This year we made it to 7w5d before pregnancy turned south. After getting advice from several doctors and weighing the pros and cons, we decided she would go the natural route in letting the body abort the embryo naturally instead of a D&amp;C or other drugs to speed the process. \n\nCurrently we are about 12 days into the process. She passed 2 pieces including the embryo on day 6 and a 3rd piece 4 days ago. On day 7 we went to the doctor to have an ultrasound to be checked if it was cleared and they said there were 2 pieces left (one was pretty deep). So, now we think there is 1 more piece (after passing the 3rd piece 4 days ago). My wife continues to have mild to medium pain and cramping but she stopped bleeding regularly. 3 days ago she had no blood, 2 days ago she had no blood, yesterday she was bleeding, today she had no blood. \n\nShe is concerned about the no blood part since she feels (from others and from reading) that the blood should continue as long as the pieces are working their way out. She wanted me to ask if this is normal or if the body may not be prepared to naturally rid itself of the last piece meaning that we may have to do this medically with assistance.\n\nHas anyone else had similar situations with the on/off bleeding during the process? Is that normal? How long did it last? Were you able to finish things naturally or did you still have to go and get the \"remnants\" cleared out?\n\nAny info or advice is appreciated.

He died an hour and a half after birth. Our world was shattered but we moved forward. We decided to begin trying to conceive in March and became pregnant in May 2018. We later, at our 6 week scan learned we were having twins! We were over the moon excited and overwhelmed and nervous. Connors condition runs thicker in twins so we decided to wait until I was 20 weeks or after the genetic scan to announce to the Facebook world but close friends and family knew. We had scans at 6, 8 and 10 weeks to confirm whether they were fraternal or identical, and I had an appointment this passed Friday. My husband couldn't be there since he was in another state on military business and I planned to leave right after this appointment for a week long visit. We figured, this is just the 12 week check up, no big deal. How wrong we were. \n12 weeks is when I thought I was out of the woods, I could relax and not worry about miscarriage. So our doctor (who is wonderful btw) took the fetal doppler, and began looking for heart beats.. and looking.. and looking. Nothing. About 2 minutes in she said she was going to get the sonogram just to make sure. But sometimes at 12 weeks babies hearts are still too small. She went and got it and immediately said \"well they've definitely grown since we've seen the last\", and then she turned the screen to face her, but I was watching her face and I knew. The first one she said had no heart beat. I said \"how do we even go about taking care of that? If the other is healthy....\" and she said \"the second also has no heart beat\".   They measured 11+5.  A D&amp;C was carried out later on the same day.  \nI do not know how to cope with this. I've only dealt with neo natal loss. I could hold him, love on him even post mortem. I have nothing for comfort in this. I dont know what I did wrong or how this happened. They were growing so well, I was already showing. I took my prenatal and drank a gallon of water a day. I drank juice and ate healthy. I dont know if my daughter will ever have a sibling or if my husband will ever be able to have his own child mothered by me. How do people cope with this??? I feel like my body betrayed me or I did something wrong somehow. Its just a nightmare.

If anyone doesn't care about my story but can help me figure out why this is happening, that part's at the bottom! \n\nHey.  I'm back.\n\nNaively never thought I'd ever have to make a post in here after my last 20 week miscarriage  (baby measured 16 weeks, we last heard the heartbeat at 17.5w). I had placenta abruption but after doing a huge blood disorder panel, they determined it was most likely a \"fluke\" and shouldn't happen again.\n\nFast forward to yesterday, when I find out I miscarried at 10 weeks. I went from a perfect 7 week scan with 161bpm, and everything looked great, to dead fetus 3 weeks later. \n\n2 days before I was told baby didn't have a heartbeat, we heard it on an at-home Doppler. Then 1 day later, I was having spotting, and the day after that I was told there was no heartbeat. The OB said baby was measuring 9w6d, so literally died the day before. What are the odds?\n\nI'm writing this as I lay in bed waiting to get the phone call for my suction thing (forget what it's called but it's not a D&amp;C), feeling so fucking defeated after having this happen again. I made sure not to get too attached to the baby until I felt like I was far enough along to be \"safe\", but I got so attached to the due date. I found out I was pregnant on my birthday, and we were due on my husband's birthday. I thought it was finally perfect.\n\nTheory: \n\nWhen the On-call OB read my chart he was shocked that the baby had been measuring so perfectly only a few weeks before. \n\nSo my theory is that I probably have low progesterone? When I'm pregnant I'm hardly ever nauseous, my boobs aren't sore, the only symptoms I get are exhaustion and some dizziness but that's about it. I know progesterone can be linked to having stronger symptoms like nausea and boob tenderness so, maybe that's it? Its obviously something in MY body that keeps fucking this up, and can't think of anything else it could be since blood disorders were ruled out but even as a precaution I was on low dose aspirin.\n\nCan anyone think of anything else I can mention to my doctor? \nBesides a blood disorder, low progesterone, a heart shaped uterus (I don't have that) I can't think of anything else that can mess with the baby??\n\nMy heart can't take another loss, and if it's something that is fixable I'd love to figure it out before trying again.

The blighted ovum was my first pregnancy and the trisomy 16 was last one. These lasted 9 weeks each until intervention with my T16 growth stopped at 6 weeks, but my the gestational sacs continued to grow until medical intervention. My two chemicals my hcg started some level under 100 when blood tested and went down from their, but both were after my period was due. \n\nI've had all the testing done. My AMH is an 8 which my RE can't decide if it is PCOS and looking at my ovaries said it could be lots of follicles instead of cysts. She said I could just be \"young and fertile\" and it's not necessarily PCOS. On pregnant and not pregnant cycles I've had low progesterone - it was an 8 on a cycle where I ovulated but did not conceive on CD 21. My husband is normal except his morphology which is 2.5% (strict) so it is pretty low. He is also twenty-five. We both did karotyping and neither of us have any abnormalities that were picked up by that.\n\nBased on the abnormality in the last pregnancy, I'm beginning to think that they were all abnormal pregnancies as a blighted ovum usually is and so are chemical pregnancies. I used to think it was a lack of hormonal support but I know if they are abnormal, no amount of hormonal support would have saved them.\n\nI am trying to figure out our odds for a healthy pregnancy without IVF with PGD. If I don't count the chemical pregnancies, my odds of the next pregnancy being healthy is good. If I do count them, my odds are lower. Do chemical pregnancies count towards odds of future loss? Is the two pregnancies I experienced considered \"chemical\"? My OB said that they weren't chemical because they occurred after my period was due, but I thought until something is visualized on an ultrasound.\n\nAlso, does anyone have any idea why two twenty-five year olds would be having so many chromosomal losses in a years time? Is it his morphology or my potential PCOS? \n\nThanks so much!

I feel like I never truly gave as much thought and love as I should have to people who went through this before I experienced it myself. This will probably be a long post, I think I\u2019m ready to talk about it and ask questions, thanks for reading, \n\nI started seeing my gynae in January because I had a really long cycle, I\u2019m usually irregular but this was particularly long - he checked me out and straight away suspected endometriosis because my ovaries looked strange but said he wanted to take a look again after I\u2019d had a cycle and would refer me to a specialist after that. Cycle came along, went back and nothing had changed - he wrote a referral and a week before I was meant to see the specialist boom pregnant, \n\nI had a completely healthy happy pregnancy till it wasn\u2019t anymore, I\u2019m fit and young - all scans were great, NT scan doctor said our little girl was a textbook baby. Fast forward to 16 weeks and I woke up in the middle of the night suddenly bleeding and I know now that I knew then already it was all over and I started mourning that night.  Went to see my doctor and he said I had placenta previa - unfortunately bleeding was a symptom and it was likely to happen again but there wasn\u2019t much to be done aside from rest and he prescribed progesterone. She still had a strong heartbeat and otherwise seemed great. \n\nI was bleeding on and off till 18 weeks and just kept telling myself it was just a symptom, I read everything I could on low lying placentas, all the positive stories but I just knew things weren\u2019t right. At 18.5 weeks I was in the shower, reached down there and something was sticking out that shouldn\u2019t have been - when I looked it was like a little rope and I knew it was the umbilical cord. Rushed to the doctor and he confirmed it was and that he couldn\u2019t do anything to save our baby. He said in his 25 years of practicing he\u2019d never seen an umbilical cord prolapse in the second trimester nor with a placenta previa and didn\u2019t know how it was even possible. I was admitted to hospital on the spot, I was given misoprostol the next morning to help things along and late that night she passed naturally.  \n\nThe tests that were done said that an infection caused the reaction. Doc said hopefully lightning doesn\u2019t strike twice and we won\u2019t do anything differently next time, to wait 3months and go for a swab to see if there\u2019s any lingering infection (I was put on heavy antibiotics after miscarrying) and then we\u2019ll be cleared in September to start trying again hopefully. \n\nHas anybody else experienced a prolapsed cord in their second tri? I have so many questions - do I have an incompetent cervix? Was it because my blood type is negative and DH is positive - did the bleeding at 16 weeks cause my blood to attack hers that quickly? Was it just a simple avoidable yeast infection that caused a PPROM? Did the suspected endometriosis play a role?

I delivered my son Albert last Tuesday at 32+2, we found out the previous Friday (20th July) that he had died and had likely been gone a few days.  On Monday 16th we had been in with the OB and had listened to his heartbeat, and while she was concerned that he was measuring a little small everything else seemed fine and I had a growth scan booked in for the Friday anyway, which was when I was told he had no heartbeat. This is technically my second pregnancy (first pregnancy was about ten years ago and terminated for non-medical reasons at 9/10 weeks), was a super easy low risk pregnancy, didn\u2019t even really get morning sickness. No problems conceiving - we got married on December 16th last year and said that after the wedding we just wouldn\u2019t try to prevent it, fell pregnant on our wedding night.\n\nI went into hospital to be induced on Sunday with misoprostal tablets, went into labour Sunday afternoon/evening but for some reason labour just stopped around 11pm. Had two more doses of the misoprostal on Monday afternoon, felt absolutely nothing, got a bit of cramping around 11pm Monday night and was in active labour (again!) by midnight. The contractions were awful, I am a tough cookie and I was crying in pain from the contractions and given multiple doses of morphine plus gas to deal with it. I gave birth around 8am and honestly that was the easiest bit, but my son was so, so small - his birth weight was 840g when he should have been closer to about 1.5kg. He was delivered breech and my contractions basically stopped at that point so I just pushed him out under my own steam, only had one contraction right at the end when delivering his head. He was small but in proportion and didn\u2019t outwardly look like there was anything majorly wrong with him.\n\nObviously I haven\u2019t had any follow up appointments at this stage to discuss test results etc (but we have ordered a full autopsy) so I can\u2019t say for sure whether we have a reason, but my gut says it was just bad luck.  I do have a general wellness check up with my GP on Monday but in the meantime I feel like there\u2019s questions I want personal experience answers to, since google isn\u2019t really consistent.\n\nJust things like, when sex is possible again, when I could start trying to conceive again (if I wanted to), more looking for what other people\u2019s experiences with that are rather than what a doctor would recommend. How long did you bleed for after and when did you get your first period after?\n\nBecause my boy was so little, I have basically no physical trauma from the birth, my bleeding has already majorly slowed down only 5 days post birth (it wasn\u2019t even really heavy to begin with), in a lot of ways I\u2019m feeling physically pretty normal and don\u2019t feel like it\u2019s going to take me 6 weeks to recover. I can do my pelvic floor exercises well beyond the recommendations with no difficulty. I wouldn\u2019t say I was super fit before/during the pregnancy but being a horse rider my pelvic floor and abs were pretty strong and that has probably helped them bounce back quickly. \n\nI\u2019m obviously still processing everything and feeling really muddled and sad and not sure what to think or feel. It has been strangely comforting to read everyone\u2019s stories here - I think it\u2019s just knowing that I\u2019m not alone, and also not alone in having this happen for \u201cno reason\u201d - so I am more than happy for you to share your stories with me here too.

So they are worried about ectopic. Go in for ultrasound. Unlike the other Er, the see a intrauterine pregnancy. But it\u2019s not viable or anything like the OB has really seen. \n\nEmergency D and C. \n\nGood news: it doesn\u2019t look like a molar pregnancy. It\u2019s not high enough hcg, I didn\u2019t bleed a lot, and it didn\u2019t really seem like one. Won\u2019t know till the biopsy. \n\nThe d and c I am having some arm tingling. Called the doctor and that\u2019s fine. Light bleeding. A headache. No cramping. Going to work today. \n\n\nI\u2019m so mad at the first ER. They misread a scan and diagnosed me incorrectly and nothing made sense. Glad I went somewhere else. If it\u2019s molar, we can\u2019t try for a year. After this experience, I\u2019m not sure I want to try and all.
