We have tried 6 iui's and one of which worked but sadly ended in CP. We started our very first round of IVF (in vitro fertilization) with ICSI in the beginning of January with birth control pills, following Hysteroscopy a to remove a polyp from my uterus.I started stimulating in the beginning of March with a mix of Menopur and Gonal-f for 5 days and then started ganerellix for 4 days. After that starting on progesterone suppositories 3 x a day. I produced many many eggs and the day of retrieval i felt very full. Dr said i had 28 eggs retrieved and out of all 9 were fertilized. On March 24th I had one 5 day Blast (c21) put back in.On April 1st i took an hpt and it came back positive. I was over the moon. I had my first beta on April 3rd to which it was 13, Following a second beta on April 6th at 26.I had a third beta on Monday which was 381. Wednesday i started having some gastro type pains on my left side and went in for an early ultrasound. We found what looked like two sacs or possible fluid but couldn't see any fetal development so dr drew blood and will have another us on he following Monday. My beta on Wednesday was 1104,climbing to 2220 on Friday. Monday was a gloomy day and as we walked into the ultrasound room i got a gut feeling something was terribly wrong. The whole weekend was torture for me as i bled on and off the whole time, together with raging back ache. The ultrasound showed nothing, nothing in my uterus nothing in my tubes or ovaries.At this point the Dr was sure this pregnancy was ectopic and set me up for the Methotrexate shot on Wednesday. Tuesday i was doing laundry and felt the sudden pain of gastro type pains again on my left side along with dark red blood, the pain was unbearable it felt worse then contractions and my husband rushed me to the nearest ER(my RE (reproductive endocrinologist) doesn't use this er), I had an ultrasound and was told that i had a \"sac and fetal pole\" measuring 6weeks1 day, however there was no sign of a heartbeat and it could possibly be a blood clot, I was also told there was a mass in my left ovary directly adjacent to my ovary which could be a dermoid. I chose to wait until Wednesday to see my RE (reproductive endocrinologist) and have him decide. I went alone to my visit to see the dr. This time we found a mass in my uterus which didn't look like a sac but rather fluid. We also seen a large doughnut type circle with a fetal pole and immediately dr said i need surgery right away. I rushed to the hospital and was admitted and asked to have the whole tube removed. Today I am at a loss for words. Could i have done something different? I never thought this would be the outcome of my first IVF. I am mad and sad at the same time and am scared to death to try again in fear that this will happen again.I do have one frozen embryo put away but dont know enough to determine if the one will make it past defrosting or if i should just do another fresh cycle and try to put two embryos in this time.", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "ttcafterloss",

Maybe I\u2019m not supposed to have kids? Maybe it\u2019s not meant to be? I just feel completely inadequate and defective.\n\nSince then we haven\u2019t really been trying (mainly not to risk another ectopic) and that\u2019s worked a number on me confirming that I\u2019m just useless in the basest form. Of course that\u2019s not the case, but I\u2019m just sad about the whole thing. \n\nI\u2019m ready to try again and just be completely prepared physically before getting pregnant. \n\nHow did you all face TTC after loss? Anyone try to get fully healthy and still suffer loss? Anyone quit smoking just to get pregnant?

Visiting my grandmother for her birthday. Last night I woke up at 3am, I was heavily spotting. The spotting progressed to cramping with bright red bleeding this morning. I was 4w4d. This is my second  miscarriage in 3 months. \n\nI'm a 7 hour drive away from my home and my husband. The only person on the trip who knew I was pregnant was my mom. I was forced to smile and introduce my toddler to dozens of my grandmother's friends, while being asked, \"do you want another one?\" And \"when will you have another baby?\" And resisting the urge to respond bitterly with, \"I'll let you know once I'm finished miscarrying this one.\" \n\nA friend asked jokingly, \"can I keep her?\" About my daughter. My dad jokingly replied, \"sure! She can just have another.\" I wish it was that easy. \n\nWith my last miscarriage the bleeding was heaviest on the second day. That will be tomorrow. Tomorrow we will be driving home. 7 hours. With a break for an early supper with my aunt, uncle and cousins. \n\nTonight, I am going to a potluck and afterwards heading back to our hosts home. Our host is pregnant. She's due the month I was supposed to be due with the first baby I lost. Now I have to listen to everyone coo over her while I lose my second. \n\nI am bitter.

I knew what  your name was going to be if you were a girl. I am still coming to grips  with the fact that I will never meet you or hold you. I won't watch you  grow up and I won't show you the way. You already found your own way  back to where you were before we met. It's a feeling of emptiness that I  never imagined I would feel.\u00a0\n\nIt has been 2 weeks and 1 day since  my emergency surgery for an ectopic pregnancy &amp; the removal of my  right Fallopian tube. As I am typing this, a little red dotted line  appears under the word ectopic, as if google is asking me, are you sure?  Did that really happen? The word 'ectopic' means, 'in an abnormal place  or position.' I was led to believe that there was no baby. But you were  there, growing inside of me, just in the wrong place.\u00a0\n\n2  weeks and 1 day since the scariest day of my life. In a matter of hours I  went from a place of wondering, but still knowing that something was  wrong with me, to being taken into emergency surgery. It was all a blur  but as time goes on, the memories return to me. I remember being asked  if I had any other children. No, this was the first time I had ever been  pregnant. I remember being asked if I had a living will. No, as an  otherwise healthy 25 year old, I had never pondered my own mortality so  intensely until that day. I vividly remember the way the energy shifted  in the room when the on\\-call surgeon entered the room to tell me what  was going to happen. He was aggressive, and shamed me for not having  followed up on my ER visit 2 weeks prior when I was told that I had a  blighted ovum and would soon have a miscarriage. 'This could have been  avoided,' he said. Well, 'it's water under the bridge at this point,' I  thought to myself as my heart rate monitor made all sorts of crazy  sounds. I asked the surgeon if he was trying to scare me. He didn't give  that much of a response.\n\nLuckily, I was far from alone that day.  My boyfriend and my aunt never left my side. My aunt, who is also a  nurse, was quick to alert the nurses and other staff members about the  aggressive bedside manor of the man who was about to cut into my body  and perform a lifesaving operation. My boyfriend did the same, and  eventually, not long after when we were up in pre\\-op, the surgeon's  demeanor had shifted to a somewhat less intense, somewhat guilty of  terrifying this poor young woman type attitude. He asked me if I was ok  and if I needed anything. I could barely even look at him. He honestly  did scare me. I just hoped he would save my life and tried not to dwell  too much.\n\nThe story begins 4 weeks ago. I was 7 weeks  pregnant. I had been spotting brown blood for a couple weeks. From this  experience I definitely learned, the internet can be your best friend  and your worst enemy. Women have it hard. Pregnancy symptoms can be very  confusing. Pregnant women have such a protective instinct over the life  growing inside of them, that it's hard not to analyze every little  symptom. Then you start to think of yourself as a hypochondriac and you  begin this cycle of worrying and assuring yourself that everything is  fine. I think my body just knew something wasn't right. Spotting is  normal, they said. The reality is about half of the time it is, and half  of the time it ends in early pregnancy loss.\u00a0\n\nIt was late  at night, I went to the bathroom and when I wiped I saw dark red blood.  It wasn't a lot, but it was there. My heart sank and I knew something  was very wrong. I immediately started crying. My boyfriend calmed me  down and asked me if I wanted to go to the emergency room. I felt ok. I  wasn't in a lot of pain. I had been a little crampy, but once again this  can be a normal part of early pregnancy. Your body is adjusting to a  bunch of new hormones, your uterus is starting to prepare to grow, there  will be discomfort. I tried to sleep that night but probably slept for  an hour or two all together. The next morning, I told him I wanted to go  to the ER because I wasn't going to be able to sleep until I knew what  was going on. It was Easter Sunday, April 1st. My first doctor's  appointment was scheduled for just 2 days later but I knew I couldn't  wait that long. We got to the emergency room, luckily the hospital close  to my house is brand new and there was no wait. We immediately got  taken back into a room. They took a urine sample and some blood samples.  I had a pelvic exam which was very uncomfortable, and a transvaginal  ultrasound.\u00a0\n\nWhen the results of the ultrasound finally  came back, the doctor came in to tell me the news. 'I'm sorry,' he  said, 'but all we can see is an empty pregnancy sac.' I was told that I  had a blighted ovum and a 'missed abortion.' As in, there was no embryo  to begin with. Knowing what I knew from my fervent research about  miscarriage, I trusted that my body knew what it was doing and I was  bleeding because my body was preparing to pass the empty sac on its own.  The doctor said I could follow up with one of their OB's if I wanted  to. I was also told that there was a small cyst on my right ovary but it  was normal and was nothing to worry about. I knew about ectopic  pregnancies and asked the doctor if it could be the baby in the wrong  spot. He said no, it's a cyst. I even specifically asked if there was  any chance this could be an ectopic pregnancy and he said no. He seemed  surprised that I even knew what that was and I should have taken that as  a sign that he didn't know for sure. I was so down and distressed that I  just wanted to go home and grieve. I decided to allow the miscarriage  to happen naturally because it seemed like my body already knew what it  was doing. I bled for 2 weeks. It wasn't super heavy but it was  definitely there. I made sure that I wasn't 'soaking a pad every hour'  and that I didn't feel faint or any excruciating pain. As the 2 weeks  went on, my pain did increase. I had gotten used to it and couldn't  separate the increase in pain from the pain I was already experiencing.\u00a0\n\nAt  the almost 2 week mark, on Saturday the 14th, I went into what I can  only describe as a mini version of labor. I was in intense pain. My  front abdominal/uterus area was cramping intensely and my back hurt  worse than it ever had during any of my worst periods. I called my  boyfriend who wasn't home at the time and was panicking. Everything had  been so up and down during those two weeks. He tried to calm me down but  asked if I thought I needed to go back to the hospital. I honestly  didn't know. After I got off the phone with him, I was on all fours on  my bed on a towel, and my body got the urge to push. I did and the  pregnancy sac came out. It was so intense. I felt an immediate relief of  the intense, fiery pain I had been in. I thought it was over. I was  seriously relaxed for about 5 hours when I felt the pain start to  return. I knew then that something was wrong. From everything I had read  about miscarriage, it just didn't seem normal. I barely slept that  night. I woke up the next morning, on the 15th and was bleeding heavily.  Still not 'soaking a pad every hour' but it was getting there. We went  to the emergency room. This time things were different.\u00a0\n\nI  was taken back into an exam room. My aunt met my boyfriend and I at the  hospital and sat with us while we got the same tests run again. My HCG  had dropped from around 11,000 2 weeks ago to 6,000, but it was still  elevated to have miscarried. A nurse told me kindly not to eat anything,  just incase. She was sweet about it and said that she didn't think I  would need surgery but not to eat just to be sure. My back was killing  me, as well as the front. A nurse gave me a Percocet for the pain and I  went back for another ultrasound. I knew what was going on in the back  of my mind when the ultrasound tech asked me if I was having pain in my  right side. I knew something was wrong when she ran the ultrasound  around my side near my liver. I didn't even question her because I knew  she wouldn't tell me anything and I didn't really want to hear it at  that point.\u00a0\n\nI went back to the exam room to wait for  the results of the ultrasound. Somewhere in the midst of this, a doctor  told me I would be fine and if I wanted to eat some crackers and drink  some water I could. I think she probably got in trouble for that later  on. Haha. You have to see some humor in things, that's how we humans  cope. This is when the \\*\\*\\*hole surgeon I mentioned earlier came in to  tell me the news. He started with 'WHAT DID THE DOCTOR TELL YOU WHEN YOU  WERE HERE LAST?!' I told him, 'he said I could follow up with an OB if I  wanted to.' 'COULD OR SHOULD,' he almost yelled. My voice trembled..as I  muttered 'could' and he went in. He told me that the baby was the size  of an orange in my right Fallopian tube. He asked me if I had any other  children and I told him this was the first time I had ever been  pregnant. He told me that he was going to have to remove my right  fallopian tube with the baby in it. I immediately went into a panic and  asked him to please not let me die. He told me that if they couldn't  remove the baby through my belly button that they would have to do a  laparotomy and I told him I didn't care as long as I didn't die. He at  least told me I wasn't going to die.\u00a0\n\nI was 10 weeks  pregnant on the day all of this happened. Ectopics normally rupture  between week 6 and 16 so I was right there. It was very real. I've  stopped myself from wandering down the rabbit hole of what if's and  thinking of all the times when I was far away from a hospital during  this ordeal and I could have ruptured and that could have been it. I am  here, I am alive and I am breathing. I feel so lucky. So many women have  had it worse. So many women have died from ectopic ruptures. Many women  have had to have more than just a Fallopian tube removed. I am  fortunate. Before this happened, I was on the tail\\-end of a 4 year  journey to health. I had lost around 60 pounds \\(I told myself I wanted  to be in a normal BMI so if the day came where I was ready to start  trying to conceive I would be as healthy as possible\\) and I was  extremely calm and peaceful. I wouldn't say I had 'no worries' but  relatively speaking, I did. This experience has shaken me to my core. I  had a 3 day anxiety/panic attack last week which was something I have  never experienced before. I believe it was a combination of the drugs  from surgery leaving my system, as well has having been nearly bedridden  for a month due to the 'miscarriage' and surgery and recovery and going  a bit stir crazy, as well as the obvious reality of what had happened  beginning to set in.\n\n\nI feel like I was initiated into a  tribe of women who have experienced suffering and loss that can't be  fully explained, only understood with experience. We live in a world  where social media tends to show us only the pretty things, women with  successful pregnancies and sweet babies. For whatever reason, pregnancy  loss tends to be shameful and a lot of women will not speak about it  unless you share your own story with them, and then they feel safe to. I  feel fortunate that I do not have resentment within me for those who  are pregnant and those with new babies. I really understand how precious  life is, and what a miracle it is to have a safe and healthy pregnancy.  To any of my friends or family memebrs who are pregnant or expecting in  the future, please don't feel the need to hide it from me. I can handle  it. And I would love to come over and hold your sweet baby and marvel  at the wonder and beauty of life. Don't hold it against me if I can't  contain my tears, they will be happy tears and sad tears. I do not have  resentment or anger but I do have sadness. Today was my follow up  appointment from my surgery, and the waiting rooms were full of pregnant  women. There was even a woman who had just found out she had not one  but two little babies growing inside of her. Her husband and her looked  simultaneously excited and terrified. I felt for them. Those initial  fears and worries while being pregnant multiplied times two. But also  the excitement is doubled. Life is really something else. You can't  control which cards you're dealt but it's up to you what you do with  them.\n\nSo here I am, sharing my story in hopes that I  open a door or a window of communication. To anyone out there who is  going through what I went through, or anyone who has but hasn't quite  been able to put into words what they are feeling. I have promised to be  someone who will be open about my experience in hopes that I can help  someone else navigate the choppy waters of this type of experience. I am  not ashamed or scared to talk about what happened. It does bring up  emotion, but that is all a part of the process. I heal when I release  and so I will continue to let these words flow out of me and into the  collective.\u00a0\n\nI am on a quest to restore the peace  within me. It is still there but it has become somewhat dormant amongst  all the stress of the month of April. My yoga practice went from daily  to 'I can barely touch my toes I am so stiff.' My twice\\-weekly 4\\+ mile  hikes that were a breeze have turned into climbing the biggest mountain  ever by simply getting out of the house and telling myself that I am not  going to die out in the middle of the woods. I am on a relaxation plan,  a plan to tune down my fight or flight system that has gone into  overdrive. I am picking up the pieces and I will be whole again soon. I  am honoring the fact that I will be stronger, more empathetic, and more  understanding. I am thankful that I have the ability to recover and I am  not faced with chronic pain that will never go away. There is so much  to be grateful for, and I am forcing myself to remember that when the  feelings of sadness or hopelessness wash up. Let the feelings surface  but do not let them linger. I am strong, I am capable, I am worthy of  feeling the peace and allowing it to overcome me like it did before.\n", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "ttcafterloss", "subreddit_id": "t5_34scd", "subreddit_subscribers": 3228, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Blighted ovum turned Ectopic pregnancy (very descriptive)", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/ttcafterloss/comments/8g4ei4/blighted_ovum_turned_ectopic_pregnancy_very/"}, {"author": "AutoModerator", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1525158849, "domain": "self.ttcafterloss", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/ttcafterloss/comments/8g6l0a/ttcafterloss_ttc_daily_discussion_thread_may_01/", "gilded": 0, "id": "8g6l0a", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 68, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/ttcafterloss/comments/8g6l0a/ttcafterloss_ttc_daily_discussion_thread_may_01/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1525158850, "rte_mode": "markdown", "score": 4, "selftext": "**This thread is for members who are TTC or waiting to try.

I'm Molly. I'm 33 and reaching the end of my 12th cycle of trying overall. My story is probably a little different than most people here, I think. But if anyone can relate I'd love to hear your story!\n\nI got married in early spring of 2016 and my husband and I started trying right away. By November I was feeling pretty disheartened and my doctor suggested that my weight might have something to do with my not getting pregnant as I was morbidly obese. I'd tried over the course of my entire life to lose the weight and my success was always minimal and short lived so, after many more doctor visits and psychological evaluations, I had weight loss surgery almost exactly a year after my wedding. \n\nThe thing about the surgery, though, was it meant waiting at least a year before trying again so my body could adjust and heal. Unfortunately, at only 5 months post-op, and even though we were using protection, I got pregnant. I'm sure you can imagine my delight and my anxiety. I knew it was too early but I was determined to do whatever I had to do to nourish that baby no matter what physical discomfort I might feel.\n\nI saw her heartbeat at 7 weeks. And I found out at 10 weeks that she'd stopped growing at 8. I was unprepared for the heartbreak I would feel. I was broken. And the worst part for me was that, despite an overwhelming urge to be pregnant again immediately, I still had to wait out my year.\n\nEight months have passed since my MMC and I am now over a year out from surgery. I've lost 170lbs and I'm on CD24 of my third cycle of trying again. I'm full of fears. What if I can't get pregnant again, like that nine months I spent trying before my surgery? What if I can get pregnant now but I can never properly grow a baby and I just miscarry every time? I'm having a hard time with essentially being back to square one, especially since no one knows for sure if it was my weight causing the problem. Maybe there's something wrong with my reproductive system. \n\nI'm trying to be optimistic and laid back about TTC but I'm definitely struggling with a lot of negative thoughts and feelings. \n\nThanks for reading and I'm pleased to meet you all.", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "ttcafterloss", "subreddit_id": "t5_34scd", "subreddit_subscribers": 3231, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Intro Post: Weight Loss Surgery and TTC", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/ttcafterloss/comments/8g7ls0/intro_post_weight_loss_surgery_and_ttc/"}, {"author": "therealamberrose", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1525179027, "domain": "self.ttcafterloss", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/ttcafterloss/comments/8g8781/community_survey_regarding_flair/", "gilded": 0, "id": "8g8781", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 17, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/ttcafterloss/comments/8g8781/community_survey_regarding_flair/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1525179028, "rte_mode": "markdown", "score": 16, "selftext": "Please take a moment to [answer a question regarding flair](https://goo.gl/forms/hnahurefhmpSUM3n1), as we try to improve this sub.\n\nDiscussion in this thread will also be allowed for the time being. \n\nThanks,\nYour TTCAL Mods", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "ttcafterloss", "subreddit_id": "t5_34scd", "subreddit_subscribers": 3232, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Community survey regarding FLAIR", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/ttcafterloss/comments/8g8781/community_survey_regarding_flair/"}, {"author": "aeb949", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1525197335, "domain": "self.ttcafterloss", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/ttcafterloss/comments/8gafpz/favorite_wallowing_music/", "gilded": 0, "id": "8gafpz", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 30, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/ttcafterloss/comments/8gafpz/favorite_wallowing_music/", "pinned": false, "post_hint": "self", "preview": {"enabled": false, "images": [{"id": "imReAmVvkrGqpgI-DEnhx3hAQsvVUQWqpTNTY4NYHts", "resolutions": [{"height": 81, "url": "https://i.redditmedia.com/2pqHe625qSMnGAaNnSEXJaIMS0QOMhuE-b57jNG9trs.jpg?fit=crop&amp;crop=faces%2Centropy&amp;arh=2&amp;w=108&amp;s=995561e1b5c9713fbdba57fa668c8d33", "width": 108}, {"height": 162, "url": "https://i.redditmedia.com/2pqHe625qSMnGAaNnSEXJaIMS0QOMhuE-b57jNG9trs.jpg?fit=crop&amp;crop=faces%2Centropy&amp;arh=2&amp;w=216&amp;s=29b750d907fe4c4a06a66e1f0f878979", "width": 216}, {"height": 240, "url": "https://i.redditmedia.com/2pqHe625qSMnGAaNnSEXJaIMS0QOMhuE-b57jNG9trs.jpg?fit=crop&amp;crop=faces%2Centropy&amp;arh=2&amp;w=320&amp;s=e75fb2c6e7f293871de2cc25002c5460", "width": 320}], "source": {"height": 360, "url": "https://i.redditmedia.com/2pqHe625qSMnGAaNnSEXJaIMS0QOMhuE-b57jNG9trs.jpg?s=4d325df276312a6ef6f26c9157a0511f", "width": 480}, "variants": {}}]}, "retrieved_on": 1525197337, "rte_mode": "markdown", "score": 8, "selftext": "What's your go-to when you just feel like wallowing?

Three years ago I was sexually assaulted and it resulted in my LC. I love her and can\u2019t imagine life without her but sometimes having her causes some really complicated feelings regarding TTC now. \n\nA little over a year ago, I reconnected with a good friend from high school and we\u2019ve been together for a year now. About a week after my LC turned 2 in August, we found out we were expecting. It was totally unplanned as we had only been together a few months. A week later at about 6.5 weeks, we lost the baby. I got some nasty commentary from my mother when I texted asking for last minute childcare to go to the ER. It was along the lines of \u201cNice way for the family to find out.\u201d And his grandfather, after hearing it from his mom, decided to tell everyone and anyone who would listen, including two of my SO\u2019s exes who have been trying to break us up since we got together because they want him back. \n\nAbout a month later, another one came out of the woodwork and decided to try to convince him she was 6 months pregnant with his baby. After repeatedly trying to weasel out of providing blood work and any other proof, she claimed she miscarried because of the stress he was causing her by asking her to provide evidence of a pregnancy. I wish I was making this up.  \n\nAfter that whole ordeal, I just desperately wanted another baby. Needed one. I felt empty. My SO didn\u2019t want to actively try, he was understandably upset and worried. We agreed on NTNP and I got a memorial tattoo as a way to feel some closure. \n\nAt the end of January, he told me to test because he \u201chad a gut feeling\u201d. He was right, and we were terrified but so happy. Because we were so tentative about our excitement, we agreed that if we had a repeat loss, we\u2019d start actively trying. And the next day I started bleeding. I fell apart. We didn\u2019t tell anyone about this one because we didn\u2019t want the toxic reactions again.\n\nThe due date of our first loss recently passed, on April 30th. I avoided everything baby related and I made it through the day totally unscathed. Or so I thought, until today. I got AF a few days before and today was my first day off of it. I\u2019ve been an emotional wreck the past few hours because it hit me like a brick wall. I wanted so desperately to be pregnant again by the due date and it didn\u2019t happen. I\u2019m crushed. \n\nI don\u2019t know why it took until today to hit me but I\u2019m just so tired of being heartbroken. I\u2019ve been doing everything I\u2019m supposed to and have nothing to show for it. It feels cruel and unfair that I got a LC out of being raped but when I desperately want one with someone I love I can\u2019t stay pregnant more than 6 weeks. \n\nThis is my first time posting any of this anywhere and I just really felt like I needed to get it off my chest, so thank you. Any advice you have would be so very appreciated.

On literally EVERY pregnancy forum/community you can think of, I read these posts about being more fertile after a MC... For most people it seemed to be something they had 'just heard', while others said their doctor told them this info.\n\nTruth be told, I did see a lot of posts from women who had conceived on their first or second cycle trying after a MC... Some even without a single period in between! But the fact that there was no scientific backup bothered me, so I tried to find some studies.\n\nWell, I couldn't find a single study that said 'you're more fertile after a miscarriage'! Every study I found said that your odds are exactly the same as before the MC. According to one study, the outcome was better for couples who started TTC within 3 months after a MC, but there is a lot of speculation that this has to do with the effect of ageing (i.e. you get older when you wait longer, fertility decreases, especially when 30+ and mostly when 35+).\n\nI must say I'm totally biased here... SO and I started TTC immediately after the MC bleeding stopped. Because I temp, I could tell that I ovulated about 3 weeks post-MC, and I had high hopes of not getting my first period and jumping straight into a new pregnancy! I thought I was going to be one of these women. Well, that didn't happen... \n\nAnd despite good timing, fertile CM, great looking charts and super regular cycles, it also didn't happen on the 2 cycles after that. I was so pissed and disappointed, especially since I've been taking vitex, maca, evening primrose oil and I just feel it has been having a positive effect on my body. Now we're on cycle 4 TTC post-MC...\n\nWith our MC, we conceived on cycle 2. Despite TTC immediately afterwards, it's already taking us twice as long. This could easily become 3 times as long (maybe even 4!) if we don't conceive this very cycle. Clearly it's just a random ballgame and we just so happened to land on our luck in cycle 2, and now it's taking longer. It really sucks when someone tells me that 'you're supposed to be more fertile after a MC'. I've read it over and over and clearly it does NOT apply to us...\n\nAnyone else pissed at taking longer to conceive after a MC, despite all the claims that you're supposed to be more fertile? Even though you do everything to be super healthy? Even though your cycles went back to normal without issues?\n\nIt's probably just about waiting for our lucky cycle, but we do plan on getting some checks around cycle 6 to be sure there are no underlying issues this time...", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "ttcafterloss", "subreddit_id": "t5_34scd", "subreddit_subscribers": 3242, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "I'm so over \"You're more fertile after a miscarriage\"", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/ttcafterloss/comments/8gps8x/im_so_over_youre_more_fertile_after_a_miscarriage/"}, {"author": "MonoChz", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1525358210, "domain": "self.ttcafterloss", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/ttcafterloss/comments/8gqtyr/how_are_you_observing_maternal_mental_health_week/", "gilded": 0, "id": "8gqtyr", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 3, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/ttcafterloss/comments/8gqtyr/how_are_you_observing_maternal_mental_health_week/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1525358211, "rte_mode": "markdown", "score": 7, "selftext": "I'm wondering if anyone has any special plans or ideas for how to observe Maternal Mental Health Week (30 April- 6 May) and/or Bereaved Mothers' Day (6 May).\n\nI've been amping the self-care this week and taking lots of long walks and I may treat myself to a Starbucks.

In a few hours I will be knee-deep in all my nieces and nephews (6 under the age of 3) and around all the family friends with their budding families. The downside of being the youngest sibling and TTC in your 30s is everyone around you is already popping out babies with (at least visible) ease, and you as the only couple sans kids are an easy target for *the questions*. But that's a rant for another time.\n\nI knew this weekend would be especially rough, so I've been doing my best to lift my and hubby's spirits by:\n\n* boxing up all the baby stuff - it's slowly grown in the last year, but putting it all in one place out of sight has been helpful\n* buying a big-ass puzzle - something we can work on together and stay distracted\n* having my favourite meal - we've been trying to eat better, but sometimes you just need some nasty enchiladas and refried beans\n* changing my hair color - I get it professionally bleached only, so I can change the color when I gd feel like it (I use manic panic). Went for a fresh coat of deep purple this morning. Looks bitchin'\n* cuddling my fur-babies - getting on the floor and playing with them, buying them special treats, getting a good dose of that unconditional-love\n* setting up home 'security' cameras - we bought them planning to make it part baby monitor, but I re-purposed it into a cat camera. I can pull the streams up on my phone and see them anywhere any time. Also, you know, burglars I guess...\n* having a date-day beforehand - we're leaving early for the party and going to go out for lunch and a walk around\n* having an escape plan - if shit gets too real today, we can signal to each other that it's time to go\n* having a plan for next time - I have an appointment with my OB to plan and get some additional testing done. She said my progesterone was low but I was already MCing when we tested, so we'll explore supplements and low-dose aspirin for next time.

My husband and I had been trying for 2 years, but before then we didn\u2019t really use birth control. We had just found out it would be difficult for me to get pregnant anyhow. Yay for messed up bodies. This was our first positive test and first pregnancy. We were over the moon and started to plan and buy a few things. At one of our ultrasounds, my gyno expresses concern with the development of the fetus and gave us the choice to wait two weeks and come back for another ultrasound. Up until then I was going weekly since we couldn\u2019t quite figure out how I got pregnant to begin with. After two weeks of anxiously waiting, getting blood work done every 48 hours, and praying incessantly...we were told our worst fears had come true. I had my d&amp;c the next day and I\u2019m still so angry. I don\u2019t understand why this happened and why I would have the promise and hope of pregnancy just for it to be taken away from me. I can\u2019t go out to any public place without seeing a bump or baby and I cry nonstop. I know I need to get out more but I can\u2019t do it. I guess it doesn\u2019t help that shortly after we found out there was trouble my husband got a job offer three hours away from all I\u2019ve ever known and we promptly moved. Everything is terrible lol.  However in an effort to gain some semblance of normalcy, I\u2019ve been tracking again and I\u2019m trying to get pregnant before my birthday May 27th. If it could happen once, it could happen again...right?
