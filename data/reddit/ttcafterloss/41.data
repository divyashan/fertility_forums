Just wondering whether any of you had been in a similar situation and what you decided to do.  In case it matters, I turned 35 earlier this year.  Personally, I can make peace with not having children if it doesn't work out, but I know my husband wants kids so I want to do all that I can to understand what's going on with my body.  The only way I can really do that is being proactive about collecting data (temping) that can be presented to an OB/RE/whoever in case it helps with diagnoses.  Or maybe I simply need to feel like I'm in control even if I really am not, I don't know.\n\nAnyway, husband and I have been actively TTC since January.  We had a positive (using a digital test) the first month, but lost the pregnancy at exactly 5 weeks.  We waited one cycle before resuming TTC, and got a barely-there positive on a dip test, but lost it at 4+3.  We didn't wait a cycle after that and just tried again right away.  For the third attempt I got two faint but definite positives along with all the same symptoms as the first pregnancy before my period was supposed to start, then at 4+1 I started spotting.  Two days later at what would have been 4+3 I started bleeding heavily.  I'm currently on CD4 after the most recent CP.\n\nSo now it's been two, maybe three CPs within 4 months, each of them ending under 5 weeks.  I only went to see my OB after the very first pregnancy loss, and she suggested I relax and stop stressing about getting pregnant.  She recommended that husband and I take a trip somewhere, chill, and don't worry about the whole baby-making business because the stress is likely not helping the situation.  Instead of relaxing per her advice, I did some research and decided to start temping sometime in the middle of the cycle that led up to the second CP.\n\nWell, a two-week trip is coming up.  I won't be taking any of the OPK stuff, but did plan on continuing to temp.

When I found out I was pregnant we decided to wait to tell our parents in person during their next visit at which point I would've been 8-9 weeks. After telling them, we planned to tell the rest of our immediate family (siblings, grandparents). We never got that far and had to tell them about the pregnancy after the fact. I waited until 4-6 days after the mc to tell our parents what had happened and it was rough to do over the phone. Frankly, neither of our families are terribly enlightened when it comes to this type of loss and made some offensive inquiries that I brushed aside as old school ignorance despite the initial sting. \n\nMIL initially pressured my husband to tell his brother and grandmother. We have a distant, at times I'd say even strained, relationship with him and his wife (who just recently gave birth to their third child in 3.5 years) so I didn't feel particularly obliged to tell them then. It's now been 3 weeks since the mc and we're note sure if or how/when to tell them, though we feel inclined to say something eventually. I just hate feeling like there's a ticking clock on it or something and although she doesn't say it with every passing week I know MIL's disapproval of our silence grows. \n\nHow do you tell someone you don't speak to regularly \"hey, I was pregnant but I'm not anymore. PS. How is your 10 week old?\" I don't want to be pitied, especially since SIL is seemingly so freaking fertile, and I don't want another 2-3 people anticipating a future pregnancy announcement because it just adds more pressure to the TTC mix. \n\nThe other option we've considered is telling if and when we are pregnant again - but I'm also at a loss for how to deliver it then without souring the potential pregnancy announcement? \"Hi, just wanted to let you guys know we are expecting again. We're especially excited considering we had a loss back in April?\" \n\nThey're very religious and will likely take our silence as proof we didn't consider it a life to mourn that we loss, which isn't necessarily the case - so I'm worried about that too. \n\nI hate that this is something I have to waste time dealing with yet here we are so any help would be appreciated. \n", "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "ttcafterloss", "subreddit_id": "t5_34scd", "suggested_sort": null, "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Telling immediate family weeks after a loss", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/ttcafterloss/comments/6aos1s/telling_immediate_family_weeks_after_a_loss/"}, {"author": "AutoModerator", "author_created_utc": 1325741068, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_text": null, "author_fullname": "t2_6l4z3", "brand_safe": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1494572734, "distinguished": "moderator", "domain": "self.ttcafterloss", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/ttcafterloss/comments/6aptpl/ttcafterloss_ttc_daily_discussion_thread_may_12/", "gilded": 0, "id": "6aptpl", "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_css_class": "ttc", "link_flair_text": "TTC Thread", "locked": false, "media_embed": {}, "num_comments": 39, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/ttcafterloss/comments/6aptpl/ttcafterloss_ttc_daily_discussion_thread_may_12/", "retrieved_on": 1497132885, "score": 2, "secure_media_embed": {}, "selftext": "**This thread is for members who are TTC or waiting to try.

There were no outward signs or bleeding. He was perfect and so were the numbers. There was no warning or explanation. Our 9 week ultrasound appointment turned around our lives in less than ten minutes. I had my D&amp;C yesterday. We are trying to look towards the future. \n\nThere was a lot of good and bad from the whole experience. DH and I still cry randomly in public places when we are reminded of Basha. I've cried so much, I don't know why my body can't produce progesterone like it does watery tears and snot. The surgery experience itself was not too bad, but someone let in a pro-lifer chaplain right before I went into surgery and she grilled me on what I thought my baby's remains would look like in a box after the D&amp;C suction. Obviously that was incredibly traumatizing and they kicked her out to wheel me into the OR. I woke up in a recovery room crying hysterically for someone to please let me see and hold my baby, or be kind and put me out again. (They sedated me with Xanax and Oxycodone and I quieted down after the anesthesia wore off.)\n\nWe decided that we just could not let Basha go as \"medical waste\" . We are going to be going through a company called \"Life Gem\" to turn his ashes into a diamond to put as a peek-a-boo stone on my wedding ring. (So that his stone touches the vein directly on the left hand.)\n\n But, I did find out I was RH negative and got the shot. I got progesterone supplements and a new wonderful Ob-gyn team. My tubes are clear, and my uterus was scraped from any endometriosis scarring. \n\nWe are both 27 years old and the doctors are super hopeful that we can become pregnant quickly on our own within the next few cycles. Currently I'm still bleeding from the D&amp;C and can't have sex. They told us to use condoms after I stop bleeding. Of course, grief and the repulsion I feel from my empty baby belly is pretty effective from stopping initiation to begin with. \n\nWe are trying to keep things positive in between crying and asking the universe why. We are trying to think of things to look forward to within the next six weeks before we get the green light. It seems so long of a wait! We are really ready to go, but we have to figure out some way to occupy the time.

I had been on bc for about 12 years and I was thinking it would take many cycles. Since I've really only ever known my body on bc, I have no idea how long my cycles are. I also know nothing about when I ovulated, either. \n\nApril 25, hcg test comes back 142. It seems low to my doctor, so he orders two more. May 1, 6 days later, it's 2,068. Great! May 5, it's slowed and is 5200. Progesterone level is 21.5.\n\nHe seems concerned, so he ordered a 7 week scan. Yesterday, at 7+1 according to my LMP, DH and I went, thinking positively and excited to see our bean. Sadly, the tech said she only saw a sac, which measured at 6 weeks. \n\nMy doctor sounded less than positive. He ordered another scan for 5.22, 10 days later, but began talking about options. Everyone is telling me success stories of it just being earlier than we thought and going back and seeing a flutter, but in my heart, I know it's over. The conception was too easy, the numbers have been too low and I have had zero symptoms and zero bleeding. \n\nI like to be prepared.

We cant afford to have things like IVF to help so if my body doesn't get into some type of normalcy then not having kids will be all my fault! \n\nFor as long as I can remember I have wanted to be a mum and everyone has said I'm great with kids and would be a great mother, but it just feels like life and the universe is hellbent on not allowing this to happen. I'm truly heartbroken... \n\nSorry if this sounds melodramatic or stupid but I have to get it off my chest because I am screaming inside for life to cut me a break and currently crying my eyes out in my bedroom as I write this and feeling like a total failure.

Who wouldn't be dreading their very first Mother's Day as a mom when their child won't be alive for it? How many women spend their first Mother's Day as a mom without any live children? It's horrible.\n\nThe day before Mother's Day, I got a message from a friend in Canada. (I live in the US.) She told me that she was thinking of me and that I was just as much a mother as other moms being celebrated. I cried. It meant so much to me to have her say that. That same day, another friend of mine gave me a cute planter of carnations. She didn't have any fancy words to say, but the action was so appreciated. I told her and another friend why I loved the gift and why carnations meant something to me. I had heard, probably somewhere on reddit, that carnations symbolize a mother's love because they don't lose their petals as they die. So if mothers are carnations, then we all still have our petals (children). I really like that symbolism, and I think carnations are my new favorite flowers.\n\nI also read up on the founding of Mother's Day. Ann Jarvis is considered the founder. She had thirteen children, and only four of them survived to adulthood. I was floored. 9 losses. This woman advocated for children's health by holding \"Mothers' Day Work Clubs\" to improve health and sanitary conditions in a time when infants and children died much more commonly than they do now. After Ann died, her daughter helped it become a national holiday in the US. She later regretted it, and protested it, because it had become so commercialized and lost much of the original meaning. \n\nLearning some of this really made me stronger for Mother's Day. I went to church, but still skipped out on the service because my pastor likes to show videos with terrible songs and lots of clip art, and I didn't want to hear about how much we should appreciate our mothers because of all the stuff they do for us. *eye roll* Don't get me wrong, I love my mom. I appreciate her, and I bought her flowers even though I didn't expect any from her. But in the end we choose to have our children, and getting special attention for taking care of the human you chose to make, doesn't seem all that important when I was denied my right to do those things.\n\nAfter church, I went to a family lunch with my husband, and I had a nice time. Luckily, I'm the oldest and none of my siblings have chosen to procreate yet. I wasn't triggered or depressed, and I have never appreciated my six siblings as much as I did then. Then my husband told me he had a surprise for me. My 17-year-old sister came out with a beautiful painting of my Raffael. The likeness is incredible! I was going to post the picture, but I wasn't sure if that was against the rules, so I didn't. If it's allowed, I might edit and paste a link. \n\nAnyway, I wanted to affirm the motherhood of each and every woman on this subreddit. I got lucky this Mother's Day and didn't have to deal with family drama or triggers or anything. But I know many of you did. You don't deserve that. You are a mother, and you deserve to be loved and taken care of. Please accept my virtual carnations as a gift to you. Heck, PM me and I will get carnations sent to you. Lol. Please take care of yourselves. \ud83d\udc95\n\nTL;DR: I learned a lot about Mother's Day, spread the word, and I got a beautiful painting of my son.", "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "ttcafterloss", "subreddit_id": "t5_34scd", "suggested_sort": null, "thumbnail": "self", "title": "My husband commissioned a painting of me holding my baby for Mother's Day", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/ttcafterloss/comments/6bbcka/my_husband_commissioned_a_painting_of_me_holding/"}, {"author": "Wafflette", "author_created_utc": 1451920141, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_text": null, "author_fullname": "t2_th3ay", "brand_safe": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1494867886, "domain": "self.ttcafterloss", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/ttcafterloss/comments/6bbmus/39_weeks_stillbirth/", "gilded": 0, "id": "6bbmus", "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "locked": false, "media_embed": {}, "num_comments": 77, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/ttcafterloss/comments/6bbmus/39_weeks_stillbirth/", "post_hint": "self", "preview": {"enabled": false, "images": [{"id": "D9ItUoyLHzggstYkDKSgCOIfnUn0iKX2LZcwHYYq41w", "resolutions": [{"height": 163, "url": "https://i.redditmedia.com/VWvmBXuRpCPnV7Jojmetj80ic7-9jNml74ZymJAq7wA.jpg?fit=crop&amp;crop=faces%2Centropy&amp;arh=2&amp;w=108&amp;s=d79e45865ead8a57e33e4fa99e3a71e5", "width": 108}, {"height": 326, "url": "https://i.redditmedia.com/VWvmBXuRpCPnV7Jojmetj80ic7-9jNml74ZymJAq7wA.jpg?fit=crop&amp;crop=faces%2Centropy&amp;arh=2&amp;w=216&amp;s=0a3a46cac083220a095138ffc303d24d", "width": 216}, {"height": 484, "url": "https://i.redditmedia.com/VWvmBXuRpCPnV7Jojmetj80ic7-9jNml74ZymJAq7wA.jpg?fit=crop&amp;crop=faces%2Centropy&amp;arh=2&amp;w=320&amp;s=3a35953f7a76142a479b3c388fd18ebc", "width": 320}, {"height": 968, "url": "https://i.redditmedia.com/VWvmBXuRpCPnV7Jojmetj80ic7-9jNml74ZymJAq7wA.jpg?fit=crop&amp;crop=faces%2Centropy&amp;arh=2&amp;w=640&amp;s=1dc4cd9d60d5a3ca7877b73c6f24c27c", "width": 640}, {"height": 1452, "url": "https://i.redditmedia.com/VWvmBXuRpCPnV7Jojmetj80ic7-9jNml74ZymJAq7wA.jpg?fit=crop&amp;crop=faces%2Centropy&amp;arh=2&amp;w=960&amp;s=12d7e21451c675911e7e27eb3e825012", "width": 960}], "source": {"height": 1627, "url": "https://i.redditmedia.com/VWvmBXuRpCPnV7Jojmetj80ic7-9jNml74ZymJAq7wA.jpg?s=e4f15720340e03840af8c3b3249041ff", "width": 1075}, "variants": {}}]}, "retrieved_on": 1497143640, "score": 56, "secure_media_embed": {}, "selftext": "I am posting this in the hopes someone else who lives through this finds some comfort in knowing they aren't alone.\n\nMy first pregnancy. I had a near perfect pregnancy, ate right, did yoga/exercised throughout, never drank/smoked, did all the testing, even amnio and baby was always fine.\n\nAt 34 weeks, my doc made me get steroid shots to boost babies lungs since they thought \"he will arrive early - no later than 36 or 37 weeks probably\" and was put on bedrest. The weeks passed and I had horribly increasing searing pain in my back and some period cramps. The docs always said I was fine and that it was normal and would use a heart doppler every appointment - baby's heart was always strong. I would go in weekly and baby had dropped and I was 80% effaced since 34 weeks but not dilating. It hurt to walk, that's how low the baby was. My doc commented at 38 weeks, \"I've never seen a baby so low last this long without being born\" and said they'd induce me around 41 weeks if baby still wasn't here. Well, every week passed and nothing. At 39+3, I felt my baby hiccup in the morning (he always hiccuped) and less movement throughout the day. I had my 39 week ob appointment the next morning, where the doctor could not find my baby's heartbeat. There are no proper words that can describe what I felt at that moment. I started to cry and had to drive to the hospital to labor and delivery. It was confirmed my baby died, that it was \"horrible luck,\" and worse, they said, \"You have to have your baby now.\"\n\nI was induced and given pitocin. I labored for a few hours, horrible contractions not even a minute apart and got an epidural and spinal tap. I had the best labor ever - I only pushed 1.5 times and baby came out - not a single tear at all. I would recommend the epidural to everyone as contractions are painful - it was the only thing that helped me get through the trauma of what I was going through - and the pain. Also, after not having a drink for so long, it was so nice to feel \"high\" from the epidural. I went from screaming/crying to feeling amazing physically (and loopy). My baby was born some 6 or 7 hours later, 5 lbs, 11 lz, 20.5\" long, beautiful baby boy with the most golden blonde hair I've ever seen. He was still warm and beautiful. I held him for a long time, rocked him, kissed him and enjoyed the few hours I had with him. We had our family come and hold him, too. It was so sad and yet I felt so much joy and pride in my baby boy - he was perfect with a little button nose and long fingers/feet. I never got to see him open his eyes, hold onto my finger or hear him cry after feeling him every day for months.\n\nWhile I was laboring, I could hear other babies being born in the hallway, crying and it was absolutely the worst day of my life. We had just installed his carseat the morning before, sterilized his bottles and hung up the last of his washed clothes the day before. While laboring, I was asked if we were going to cremate or bury our son, if we wanted an autopsy, etc. We buried him 2 weeks later. We were and still have never been given any reason for why this happened. It wasn't a cord issue, it wasn't a placental abruption - baby had no issue, which is why this has been even harder to accept. I couldn't get out of bed for 2 weeks. It hits me in waves all the time, the reality of what has happened and I truly would not wish this on my worst enemy. While all the new parents walked out of the hospital with their new babies, in our same stroller/carseat that we'd bought, we had to leave our baby in the morgue. As I picked out his funeral plot at the cemetery, I still had his carseat in the back of my car. Coming home to a nursery without a baby, and all his bottles on the counter still, was the most horrific and tragic thing ever. I had 3 baby showers and was given so many gifts for him. I think over 70 items were purchased from his registry. I haven't had the heart to take his nursery down and still cry every day and it's been 7 weeks now. Yesterday for mother's day, I went to take him flowers at the cemetery. It's a strange thing to be a childless mother.\nI honestly feel that had I been induced earlier, this would not have happened. The doctors told me he was so low all the time and did nothing. I was always waiting for contractions to be minutes apart and it never happened but I now think that all my back pain was my contractions (back labor?). The docs always told me I was fine though.\n\nTo add insult to injury, my breasts leaked forever, I bled so much, all the physical reminders and I've not been able to lose the 20 lbs I put on. My pregnancy was one of the happiest times of my entire life and I am now living one of my saddest. I usually find comfort in prayer/God but that has all been thrown in the trash. I find no solace in that. My doctor told me at my postpartum appointment that he had \"no doubt\" that had I been induced earlier, baby would still be here. :(\nI am posting this story because my beautiful boy existed in me for so long and I loved him, knew his patterns, felt him, experienced so much joy with him. All I wanted was to have him. I feel a huge void and as if I had nothing to look forward to. My hubby's father died 2 weeks before our son which has been hard on him. I want to try again but I am so terrified of this recurring. This happens less than 1% of the time in pregnancy. No matter if I ever do fall pregnant again, I know I will be terrified the entire time and the naivety I had over pregnancy with a happy ending is gone. Had this happened early in my pregnancy or even in the middle, I would feel different. But to have had it all go away at the finish line was so heartbreaking. It is the great tragedy of my life.\n\nBaby tax: [Imgur](http://i.imgur.com/6pnVXIV.jpg)", "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "ttcafterloss", "subreddit_id": "t5_34scd", "suggested_sort": null, "thumbnail": "self", "title": "39 weeks Stillbirth", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/ttcafterloss/comments/6bbmus/39_weeks_stillbirth/"}, {"author": "jokersmadlove", "author_created_utc": 1368134516, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_text": null, "author_fullname": "t2_bmby3", "brand_safe": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1494877163, "domain": "self.ttcafterloss", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/ttcafterloss/comments/6bclhg/just_once_i_wish_they_would_ask_if_we_are_ok/", "gilded": 0, "id": "6bclhg", "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "locked": false, "media_embed": {}, "num_comments": 8, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/ttcafterloss/comments/6bclhg/just_once_i_wish_they_would_ask_if_we_are_ok/", "retrieved_on": 1497144115, "score": 34, "secure_media_embed": {}, "selftext": "Saturday my husband and I went out to his parents for Mothers Day.

At registration, I was told my co-pay would be $250, which I was glad I could just get a bill for. Then went to Surgery to check-in. I was called back pretty immediately, and my partner was allowed to come in with me. The pre-op area was one of those areas where there's a large center \"nursing station\", and around the edges are sort of private rooms. It's like separating side walls and large glass slider/curtain in front. The woman who took me back took my vitals and told me how to change. The transition from \"regular person\" to \"patient\" was super weird, and I was in my hospital gown sitting in a chair, and nurse had to ask me to get up on the bed. :P Then my pre-op nurse came in to hook up my IV. Waited maybe half an hour, then the anesthesiologist and OR nurse came to ask a few questions. Then my doc came in to explain all the risks again (same as pre-op office visit). [i specifically asked for one last ultrasound, so he rolled one down from L&amp;D and we also did that during this time]. Then it was my turn to get wheeled in. My gurney got rolled right next to the OR bed, they had me sit up for them to untie me, then I scootched myself over, now with my butt directly on the sheet. They laid my arms wide, which felt weird like a sacrificial way. In the room was my doctor, anesthesiologist, OR nurse, and 1 more person who I hadn't met before (she's the one who had me scootch down, put my hat on). Anyway, I went out quick, then woke up in recovery. I immediately started crying from the loss. The recovery nurse was very nice. She gave me an antibiotic, water, and crackers (which I threw up on the way home). After my okay, she called for my partner to join me. She took care of paperwork with me, helped me change, and wheeled me out to where my husband was now waiting with the car.\n\nQuick thoughts based on what I've read about others' experiences:\n\n- I did not have to take pre-meds night before or during the 2 hour wait to soften my cervix or anything like that. My doc said that's an older practice that hasn't proven to be beneficial.\n\n- I did not take an anti-anxiety med\n\n- ultrasound (to confirm MC, as an example), is not standard at my hospital. i had to make a specific request\n\n- your doc may not know about release of remains to you or funeral home, but they'll figure it out after asking L&amp;D, who have more experience with it\n\n- I thought arriving 2 hours early would be long and boring (brought tablet, podcasts, etc), but there's actually not a long downtime period.", "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "ttcafterloss", "subreddit_id": "t5_34scd", "suggested_sort": null, "thumbnail": "self", "title": "PRE-d&amp;c experiences?

And it's only been five days since the D&amp;C. We both scrubbed down really hard together in the shower and I took an antibiotic I was given, and we made love carefully. I know that's a big no-no while you heal down there. And we are fully aware that it was risky (even with new contraception) as I had just stopped bleeding today. But we needed it so badly. It was wonderful. We just held each other and it was like the very first time. There was no pain. Both of us just felt such a sense of peace and love for the first time since we found out our baby was gone. We fought so much and it was miserable grieving. But tonight was just new and it felt like things would be okay now. \n\nOur TTC journey is going to start soon after things heal up more in the next few weeks. (I have never done anything slowly or as I'm supposed to in my life, this time line included.) But I just wanted to share that even though this week was hell, we are more in love with each other than ever and we are ready for a rainbow.", "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "ttcafterloss", "subreddit_id": "t5_34scd", "suggested_sort": null, "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Today was our beginning.

I had a mc last October and I'm in the midst of another one now, and they're almost exactly the same circumstances. Just over 7 weeks pregnant, heavy bleeding occurring soon after an ultrasound that showed a healthy heartbeat and a foetal pole. Last time it was a complete mc and I didn't need a D&amp;C and I'm hoping when I go to the doctor tomorrow that it will be a similar story this time. I am willing to accept maybe it's just two instances of bad luck but I don't want to have to go through this a third time in a row so I want to push my doctor to do some tests to rule out some basic causes that might otherwise be preventable. For example, I've heard there's a blood clotting disorder some people have that can be treated with baby aspirin in early pregnancy. Do you think the doctor will be willing to get some tests done despite it being only two mc in a row instead of three? I'm in Australia.

We tried long and hard for this to happen and didn't want to get our hopes up but with each doctor visit we got confirmation that not only was she doing fine, she was exceptionally strong, excelling all tests and looked so beautiful!\n\nAt week 35 we took a trip to summer house where she was made, last trip before she arrives. The kicking that has been accompanied us for so long suddenly stopped after a few unusually active hours. We expected as much because she had not yet turned and wasnt alarmed. After all we are past the week where they could keep her alive even if she came early.\n\nA few days later we went for a extra checkup since we were getting a little bit concerned but not alarmed. The nurse measured, then left the room, came back with doctor now and my fiance started looking to be for comfort. I could see in her eyes the fear suddenly washing over her. \n\nThe doctor checked a bit and said. Your babys heart is not beating, I'm sorry but she is not alive. My fianc\u00e9 starting shouting \"how could this be? How could this be? What do you mean?\". I sat with her for a bit and then I had to go outside to inform my mother in law who was with us. This was such a sudden chock she collapsed in my arms. Everything came crashing down around me...\n\nWe went into induced labour the next day. It was all like it should be, only we knew we were giving birth to our dear daughter. I knew better but still a part of me hoped she would come out fine and we would find the all the machine had been wrong. \n\nOutside the window of the room a rainbow was shining and inside my room we screamed of pain and sadness as we untangled the umbilical cord from around our daughters neck.\n\nFor two days they have kept us under observation now. My fianc\u00e9 can not sleep and we both take turns calming the as the tears just never stop. I feel no purpose of living any more and try to hide this feeling from her because she needs me strong. She is missing the kicking, keeps looking at our last ultrasound 3d picture saying how perfect our daughter were because she looked like us, she looked exactly like we hoped and dreamed. Every word from my fianc\u00e9s mouth breaks pieces inside of me, she deserves to be a mother, she deserves nothing of what she must go through.\n\nI still can't understand everything that has happened. I don't know what to do and the only thing I want is to fall asleep because that is the only time I feel less. Every time I wake up I take a second to see if this was all just a bad dream, only to find it was not and then I break down again. The screams of new born babies outside our room makes me miss her so, so much!\n\nI left for a few hours yesterday to pack away the cradle at home, pack all the baby clothes and to get the onsie we sewed for her, as that will be her burial dress. \n\nI'm so forlorn and scared. I don't know how to deal with this and if this indeed was our last chance I struggle to see a reason to continue living.\n\nIf there was anything I could do to change the past I would in a heartbeat, the heartbeat my daughter is missing!

I required emergency surgery and lost my left tube. After time off work, therapy, gaining and then losing weight from all the numb sitting around netflix watching I had my second cycle and the okay to try again. We ate so healthy, did yoga everyday and I even started running. We were both feeling so good, so healthy, so optimistic. When I found out we were pregnant again we didn't get attached or excited or make any plans. Then last week it was over. \n\nI am a teacher and while I was off they gave my class to another teacher so now that I am back I am just supporting other teachers. The class I was assigned to yesterday when I walked in, I saw the teacher and her bump. She's due when I should have been. She is walking around with her bump, getting on with her job, the kids and getting ready for her summer because she'll be on mat leave after that. THAT should be me. I kept it together until recess and then broke. Every bit of sadness that was even unknown to me broke my heart open and I cried. The ugly, heaving, uncontrollable sobs that choke uou. I had to go home. Not many people know I am going through a second ectopic because I am so ashamed. I don't want to talk to people about it. I don't want the pity and the tilted heads asking how I am doing. \n\nSo now I wait for the results to see the chemo injection has stopped this pregnancy from growing. It breaks my heart that I am hoping the pregnancy is over because I want it, I want this baby. So maybe its over, maybe I have to go to the awful cancer clinic for another injection or maybe surgery. Its cornual this time which means I'd lose a wedge of my uterus, making future pregnancies high risk in combination with the risk of yet another ectopic. \n\nHow do I move forward?

This is my third miscarriage but first time medicated (first was D&amp;C second was natural).

Four hours later nothing had started and I decided to check on the tablets. They were all still there!

I went to bed nervous that I'd wake up in pain.\n\nWoke up this morning, still nothing, not even a spot on my napkin.

I'm so sorry for you and I promise this isn't meant to be insensitive.\n\nI'm currently miscarrying at 6 weeks and I just feel this shouldn't be happening. With the twins everyone said they just got sick and it happens sometimes and we just had bad luck but that next time, it wouldn't be twins and it would be a normal, healthy pregnancy and everything would be fine. But everything is not fine. Why am I always on the shitty side of statistics?? What am I doing wrong?? I feel so sad for all these little babies. Maybe it's unfair to them to keep bringing them into existence if they won't even get the chance to live. \n\nI hate that I've now had four pregnancies and I only have one child. Maybe I'm being selfish. Should I stop trying and be content? I just don't know what to do and I hate that this is happening.\n\nAny advice on how long I'll bleed? How long before we can try again? Should we try again?\n\nI'm a mess.
