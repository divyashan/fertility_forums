With 3 of them under my belt in 10 months, I almost think it's unfair that I can't share what I'm going through publicly. If I fell and broke something and needed surgery for it, or had a stroke or car accident, there would be no feeling that I had to \"hide\" and suffer on my own. Things could be posted on social media, relatives and friends could be told and pain and grieving could be shared more openly, resulting in more of a feeling of connectedness and support. \n\nI might just be having an emotional day, as it's currently raining and gross outside, and one week ago today I was in the OR having a d&amp;c, but has anyone here taken a public approach to their pregnancy loss(es)? I've been thinking a lot this past week about posting (on FB) a picture of our 7-week ultrasound where we told there was no heartbeat, and saying \"this is our baby\", etc., making a statement about how many of us do go through miscarriages alone and how difficult things are to share publicly when society tells us to be quiet about such things (something to that effect)...\n\nNow that I'm putting this into words, I'm feeling like it's sounding more and more like \"pity me, give me attention\" than anything else, and would probably just embarrass my husband and myself in the long run, as I don't necessary enjoy being the drama queen/oh-woe-is-me-type. Is this stupid and self-serving? Is there anything to be gained by going public on social media, or would it just be dooming me to months and months of awkward encounters with friends and family in the future? Thoughts?\n\nedit: after discussion with dh, I decided to take a more subtle approach and change my profile picture to a mc awareness ribbon. Though I would really love to connect more with friends who may have gone through this, he feels like the best way for him to grieve is privately (and there's really no way that can happen if I post something public, as we share about 50% of the same friends on there). Maybe this way, the ones who truly care will take the time to look up what the ribbon means and ask me about it.\n\n[mc awareness ribbon](https://fbcdn-profile-a.akamaihd.net/hprofile-ak-xap1/v/t1.0-1/p200x200/11074158_10106442532016014_3028400524922374827_n.jpg?oh=89fde1a2017e774a596c985994b6f976&amp;oe=55AFF4E3&amp;__gda__=1434195510_ef76acbc740bc78cb0ff3724fbbcba50)", "stickied": false, "subreddit": "ttcafterloss", "subreddit_id": "t5_34scd", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Is this tacky and self-serving?", "url": "http://www.reddit.com/r/ttcafterloss/comments/30aa3f/is_this_tacky_and_selfserving/"}, {"author": "mrswaka", "author_created_utc": 1411586493, "author_flair_css_class": "", "author_flair_text": "22, TTC#1, 3CPs, cycle 16, endo", "author_fullname": "t2_ik1mm", "created_utc": 1427322112, "domain": "self.ttcafterloss", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/ttcafterloss/comments/30azkc/what_other_subreddits_do_you_love/", "gilded": 0, "id": "30azkc", "is_self": true, "link_flair_css_class": "offtopic", "link_flair_text": "Off Topic", "media_embed": {}, "num_comments": 47, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/ttcafterloss/comments/30azkc/what_other_subreddits_do_you_love/", "retrieved_on": 1440832596, "score": 7, "secure_media_embed": {}, "selftext": "You guys are the best community I have ever been a part of.

We've been together for nearly 10 years, dated in high school. Anyway, before we started dating, he had two one-night stands with this chick (she was one of my good friends, but really took advantage of him because he had just gotten out of an abusive relationship and was pretty vulnerable). He wore a condom both times, but I remember her bragging to me that she bit a hole in it while giving him a blow job. \n\nA month goes by and she excitedly told everyone **except for him** that she was pregnant and that she was so excited to get married because they had taken each other's virginities. Then, out of the blue, she said she miscarried the baby. He had no idea about this entire thing until after about three years of us dating when I brought up how stupid that was.\n\nHere's my question: What if she wasn't doing that for attention and she really was pregnant?

I was 9 weeks, and it took over two months for the full miscarriage to happen after that. Traumatizing is an understatement! My Dr refused to give a D&amp;C because I have two uteruses (uterus didelphys) and she did not have alot of experience with it, so instead of referring our case to someone who did have experience she just made me take the pill things and wait it out. It sucked. Traumatizing is an understatement. That about three months later found out I was pregnant again, next day started bleeding but levels were still rising, turns out it was probably ectopic. Again no D&amp;C, just the injection thing.......the day before my birthday. Again worst timing ever. We spent the day at the hospital and because it was my birthday the next day we had friends coming over to celebrate, we couldn't get a hold of them to cancel so had to be all cheery and stuff while they were there (wasn't willing really to talk about it with anyone).\nAnyway, after that I asked my Dr for testing, even though I hadn't had a third one and she refused, I asked if I could have this because of the two uteruses my anatomy is different I wanted to know if that could be part of the problem with carrying, she again refused so I went back to my family medical  Dr to get referred to a new Dr, I wait for over a year and finally got in to see one. Who is just plain awesome,  she actually works in the same building as my previous Dr and said she was really displeased by what had happened to me, she listened to my concerns and we are starting to do full work-ups, because of my anatomy thought the HSG test would be both extremely painful and not overly useful to the Dr so she is going to a laproscapy to get a better look, right now I'm just waiting for that to be booked. In the meantime she says I'm safe to continue trying if I'm feeling up to it. So we are kind of trying but not overly focusing on it until all the testing is done.\nIf anyone has any questions with regards to uterus didelphys let me know and I would be happy to answer as best as I can ", "stickied": false, "subreddit": "ttcafterloss", "subreddit_id": "t5_34scd", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Hi everyone!

Physically I'm fine, but emotionally I'm red raw.  I had hidden my pregnancy from all, but one nurse who I had already told about my loss. So I get to work and one of the interns rushes down all excited and asks me if I want to see something cool.  I'm like, hell yeah, first distraction, hopefully a cool surgical case.  So up I go to the imaging room where one of the nurses is performing an abdominal ultrasound.  On herself. Of her 12 week old foetus.  She has just announced (via the ultrasound on shift) and I was completely taken by surprise.  I would have been 2 weeks behind her.  So I did what any good professional would do and crept out of the room with tears streaming down my face.  Spent the whole 13 hr shift in and out of the bathroom crying hoping no-one would notice.

I won't name said subreddit, I'll let you all conclude which it is. But I keep trying to go on there to read and be excited for others and my possible future pregnancy. And every freaking time I am so enraged at what I see encouraged or ignored. \n\nStory 1: I click a post titled \"What not to do during pregnancy\". First comment is a joke about MIL's (guess which sub yet?). I scroll down, and someone says \" Let the downvotes come, I went on a rollercoaster at 11 weeks and I was fine and baby was fine. I listened to my body.\" Oh how in tune of you...\n\nIn response, people are encouraging them for doing this, saying that \"Your body would have told you if you were doing harm to the baby, you would have felt cramps or something, so good for you\". \n\n/facepalm\n\nI explained that it is because of placental abruption from sudden stops and starts, and yes your body will tell you, after, when you either start bleeding or don't. I don't care if rude anymore, tough shit if everyone is making excuses. Your body yes, but I'll not stand by and let ignorance be upvoted.\n\nStory#2: I see a post about a lady with an IUD in, who felt pretty pregnant, her boobs grew, her Mom said she was pregnant, but *it was too early to take a test so...* and she did nothing. Now she is bleeding all strange and it is different and her question is.....\"Am I pregnant?! I'm so excited.\"\n\n\nAaaarrghh!!!! Why?! Why why why. An IUD in while pregnant is so very bad. The risk of ectopic is just...you know what, I can't. \n\nI am enraged at how little these people care about causing the loss of their pregnancies! I am so angry. I don't get my son but they do? These people?!\n\nI'm sorry. I just needed to say these judgey bitter things to someone. I am so bitter.

Life is kinda crazy for me right now. I stopped taking BC(depo shot) end of Jan and well I am kinda just waiting for my body to get back to normal. Finally, I have stopped seeing blood when I wipe, so yay on that. Maybe this means that a) I am pregnant or b) that I will be getting my period soon. I am kinda hoping for A. \n\nAnyway, yesterday I had a breakdown while driving home from the store. There is this girl who I am not related to, but she is the mother of my great nephew.  I used to work at a resturant with this girl when she was going to highschool with my nephew.  (I was 6 when my nephew was born, and there is a 12 yr difference between his mom and me). Anyway, she used to tell me all the time how cute my nephew was and how she wanted to date him. This is not the type of girl I would want my nephew to be dating, if ya get my drift. Anyway, they ended up dating and she got pregnant, this was like 7 years ago. So, again I normally don't have to deal with her. And the only reason we are friends on FB is becuase of my great nephew. So my mom was telling me the other day that Heather was braggin about being a good mom on FB, and how she spent $500 on food. Now, I will say that my g-nephew is a pretty awesome, well-behaved kid. I think that is all in part due to the fact that a lot of time had been spent with my sister. My sister doesn't take any crap and always demands respect. I kinda chuckled to myself about the whole $500 on food. I wouldn't brag unless I was saving $500 on my shopping trip. So I decided I needed to see this for myself, I wanted to know if it was for a week, for a month. \n\nSo I am lurking around looking for the post and I can't find it, oh well. Instead I see this:  (on March 18th) \"Ok.... Well, since I told my grandma, the scariest part is over. Guess I will share my secret with the world now. IM HAVING A BABY!!!!!!\" Now the reason this makes me so angry is because I feel that she is completely undeserving of this pregnancy. While I would like to say she is a decent mother, I can't. Why because she has been in and out of this (what I would label an abusive relationship) for 3 years. This man that she claims loves her is the worst kind of person. He is always throwing her out when he is mad, he bad mouths my g-nephew, calls him names, etc. Just a little over a month ago she posted this:\"How u gonna be so lame as to throw away my sons shoes and take his school uniforms and have the nerve to act like im supposed to give two shits what u say about anything. Everything else u did is in the \"o well\" box but when u act like a petty bitch and act against my kids there is not any comin back from that. U lucky my sons dad dont come smack fire out yo ass for treatin his son and his things that way. Wow.... mmmmm turnt up too early\".  She already has one kid by this man, in which she lied about him being the father for the longest time.  The only reason why I feel she got pregnant was so she can keep this man, thinking that another baby will change the dynamic of the relationship. The girl smokes and drinks (while pregnant too). Can't keep a place of her own (was on section 8 housing for a year), cause she can't keep a job. And here she is pregnant with her 3rd baby. And here I am, eating healthy and exercising. Own my own home and buisness (well my husbands self-employed but I kid that I am his boss), and I loss my baby. Why in the world is this even remotely fair! What in the world did I do? \n\nI just want to message and go off on her so bad. I want to message and say, \"they have learned how to prevent those pregnancies, perhaps you should use Dr. Google and look it up\", amoung others choice words. Am I in the wrong here, should I just ignore it? I am trying to figure out why she is more deserving then I am.

If you use [RES](http://redditenhancementsuite.com/) you can add a filter so you won't ever see the Alumni thread on the sub. Go to your RES settings console (the little cog by the logout button in the upper-right hand corner of your screen), click \"Filters\", and under \"keywords\" click \"+filter\", add the keyword \"alumni\" and have it apply only on this sub (ttcafterloss). There are also filter options in some phone apps like Baconreader, although in that app specifically I don't think you can set it to a specific sub, so it might block any post that has the word \"alumni\" in it. \n\nThanks to everyone who responded to the poll!

I am 25 and currently trying to conceive our second child.\n\nMy pregnancy with DD was very difficult. At my 18 week ultrasound, right after we were told the gender, the ultrasound tech spotted a fluid filled sac on DD back. She was diagnosed with a Myelomeningocele (form of Spina Bifida). The rest of the pregnancy was filled with almost weekly ultrasounds and a couple of MRIs. At one day old, DD had spinal surgery.\n\nMy husband and decided that we were ready for baby #2 in July 2014 and had my Nexplanon implant removed. We waited until August to start trying. September rolls around and I experienced what I thought was a period. So we continue trying. On October 4th, I woke up with extreme pain on my left side. Once in the emergency room, I started bleeding. The doctor told us that I was pregnant and probably experiencing a MC. He wanted to get an ultrasound to confirm. Before the ultrasound, the tech congratulated us on the good news...I couldn't believe she had said that. The fetus could not be seen in the ultrasound and my abdominal pain was increasing exponentially. The doctors then came to the conclusion that I was having a ruptured ectopic. I rushed into the OR for an emergency salpingectomy. The surgeon told me that my left fallopian had ruptured and was too damaged for it to be repaired. He had stated that my right fallopian tube also had scarring on it.\n\nAfter the ectopic, my husband and I were heartbroken. We decided that we would start trying again once my first normal period was over. This time we would be more prepared. At the end of November, I took a pregnancy test that was positive.\nBecause I had had the ectopic, my doctor wanted to monitor everything closely during the early stages of this pregnancy. I was going in every couple of days to have my blood drawn to see is my hCG levels were rising correctly. Everything was starting to look up for us until we had a 6 week ultrasound. The doctor could only see a gestational sac with no yolk sac. We were told that maybe our calculation of conception was off and the baby was younger. Cue the 7 week ultrasound. Everything looked exactly the same as the week before, no yolk sac, no growth. The doctor told us to come the next week for another ultrasound to confirm that I had a Blighted Ovum. I miscarried on January 7th at 8 weeks and 2 days. The miscarriage lasted for almost 2 months.\n\nHaving the second loss of a baby so soon after the first is hard. My husband supports me anyway that he can and I am so grateful for that. But I am very depressed. I have an appointment with a therapist on the 22nd of April. We are hoping that we can start trying again in the next month or two.", "stickied": false, "subreddit": "ttcafterloss", "subreddit_id": "t5_34scd", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Intro Hello!", "url": "http://www.reddit.com/r/ttcafterloss/comments/310x5t/intro_hello/"}, {"author": "AutoModerator", "author_created_utc": 1325741068, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_text": null, "author_fullname": "t2_6l4z3", "created_utc": 1427871739, "distinguished": "moderator", "domain": "self.ttcafterloss", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/ttcafterloss/comments/3111wq/ttcafterloss_ttc_daily_discussion_thread_april_01/", "gilded": 0, "id": "3111wq", "is_self": true, "link_flair_css_class": "ttc", "link_flair_text": "TTC Thread", "media_embed": {}, "num_comments": 75, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/ttcafterloss/comments/3111wq/ttcafterloss_ttc_daily_discussion_thread_april_01/", "retrieved_on": 1440820313, "score": 7, "secure_media_embed": {}, "selftext": "This thread is for members who are TTC or waiting to try.

Thank you for your suggestions in trying to reduce the trigger events; I have spoken to the head of one of the hospitals I work with and I am fortunately not rostered on there with anyone pregnant (the nurse who ultrasounded her baby and another pregnant women) for a month.  By then I should be a little be better able handle things.  At my other (main) hospital, I have not gone to management, mainly because they gossip - they tell me many things they shouldn't and I think it safer to hold my cards to myself as I am a very private person about health.  The good news is that the main nurse I work with has known about my pregnancy and miscarriage (she was my co-conspirator in keeping me away from x-rays and anaesthetics) has been very supportive.  We work with a nurse who is 20 weeks pregnant and very obnoxious about it (actually she has always been a bit narcissistic).  We had always chuckled about the difference between my approach to pregnancy and hers. Obnoxious nurse has been off this week and my awesome nurse has promised to keep her away from me should she start harping on about anything that could be a trigger.  The other vet who is pregnant is not rostered on with me for ages, so I am feeling a little better about work.  I have turned facebook off as I was not blocking pregnancy announcements or births quickly enough and they seemed to be occurring daily. I am exercising, which is helping me feel a little better, although I go through random bursts of feeling teary at training.  I think I have gone from feeling hollow 90% of the time to 50%.  Regardless I think I could be handling things better and am thinking of getting some counselling to help me manage. I have a history of depression (albeit not for 10 yrs or so) and I am scared it is going to rear it's ugly head. Unfortunately the universe has decided I need a bit more punishing and this evening I found out my neighbour (apartment next door) is 14 weeks pregnant.  I can't avoid pregnant people forever and want to be happy for them, so I hope counselling will provide me with some coping strategies.  I am sick of my heart dropping like lead every time something reminds me of where I should/want to be. I think things will get better when CD1 arrives and I can focus on something positive.

I've been a lurker here for the last three months and I finally decided to get company.\n\nLast January 5, my first ultrasound showed my 7 week baby burger along with a subhorionic hematoma (SCH). The SCH was thrice as long as the little one. That time I had a feeling something was wrong, but the OB told me everything will be fine. \n\n6 days later, I had spotting. A few minutes later, the spotting became a huge gush of blood and then I knew something was really wrong. I called my OB and she told me to calm down, take some Duphaston, lie down, and go to her clinic the very next day.\n\nThe next day, January 12, the ultrasound confirmed my horror: my placenta broke at the spot where the SCH was and the fetal age showed the burger died on the night of that bleed. After that the OB told me that SCH had a 50% chance of doing damage to the pregnancy. I am a numbers kind of gal, so I wish she was just honest.\n\nSo I had a D&amp;C on January 13, which at least went well. I  just finished the 3 month waiting period my OB recommended and we are currently NTNP. \n\nWell, I didn't want to go through the symptom spotting and fear by myself, so I decided to stop lurking. I'm still feeling awful since I will never look at pregnancy through innocent eyes again, but I am happy with the other aspects of my life. It's like even with everything working perfectly in my life, it will never be 100% rainbows and sunshine. \n\nThanks, eveyone. I am in your care!

This post will mention pregnancy after loss and a few things about pregnancy/baby preparations. That said, I still think that those who are still TTC may have good insight, so if you are able to read on, I would love to know what you think. If not, I totally get it. And if it shouldn't go here, I understand, but we've all had the conversation about how TTCAfterloss doesn't exactly stop with the positive test.\n\nOkay, here we go. I posted on the alumni thread about how I'm struggling with having in-laws. I don't know how to have or be an in-law. Sometimes I barely know how to people because I'm pretty introverted. But it's more than that. Let me explain.\n\nI don't really like my in-laws much. There, I said it. They have no boundaries with my husband or each other. They are willfully ignorant and being in public with them makes me want to crawl into a hole. For example, last year on Father's Day, we had a picnic at a local park. At this picnic, my mother in law made a joke about @bortion that I won't even repeat here because it was so awful. On Father's Day. At a park. My brother in law emotionally abuses his children. As a licensed teacher, I can only see so much before I'm obligated to report and I've warned my husband about that. My father in law has used the word \"tits\" in reference to my breasts before. \n\nLet's just say it isn't easy. My mom thinks they aren't that smart but I don't see it that way. I think it's ignorance and lack of social skills.\n\nThat said, here's what's going on. Ever since we found out about this pregnancy, it's been one inappropriate comment after another from my father in law and many of them occur on Facebook. It's to the point that I want to deactivate Facebook because I can't handle this. Initially, he was talking with my sister in law about HER having another baby but brought me into the conversation by saying I needed to \"hurry up\" and produce some grandchildren. Needless to say, I was pretty upset. I already knew about this pregnancy, but we hadn't gone public yet and I was still pretty early on and terrified of a miscarriage. But I tried to let it go. I hate Facebook drama and keep all posts pretty light and uncontroversial because of that fact.\n\nCut to today. I posted about maternity shopping with two of my friends. They had looked at baby clothes while I shopped. It was fun. It was good for me. It was a day that I was positive and happy and not sitting on the couch ticking off the ways I could still lose this baby. The post kind of blew up with advice from other moms about where to shop and then my sister in law popped up and offered to let me go through her maternity stash and borrow some stuff. It was all very lighthearted. My father in law pops up and again starts talking about how my sister in law needs to have another baby and THEN goes on to say that I would need maternity clothes next year, too, implying that I needed to hurry up and have another baby fast. As in, in addition to this one.\n\nSo I was upset. I recognize that I'm probably extra sensitive right now. But then he didn't stop. My phone is blowing up from notifications on this post, so I texted my husband to vent. My husband got upset and jumped in to tell his dad to shut up and that \"we're not breeder cows.\" (Okay, that comment was pretty funny.) They ended up arguing. On Facebook. For a bit. It comes down to my father in law thinking that he's joking, telling my husband to \"pull the stick out of (his) ass,\" and that he was only making \"harmless\" comments.\n\nI'm sorry, but it's not harmless. It's incredibly hurtful. Ignoring the implication that my only worth as a woman is tied up in my ability to reproduce, he acts like we haven't *tried*. We lost two babies in a year AND I got the pleasure of having a fallopian tube carved out. I don't even know if this baby will survive, despite all my hopes. Things could still happen. I guess I just feel like it's not cute, it's not funny, it's not a joke. We've been through hell to get here. And assuming we do get to bring home a baby, I'm not sure when or if we'll be ready to go through hell again. Or if it will be possible. I still have endometriosis and Factor V Leiden and one tube. And I have limited emotional capacity to continue. I'd like to think that if we only have one biological child, I still have a purpose in life and that I'm still a woman. I have a lot to offer outside of my somewhat damaged and diseased reproductive system.\n\nAnd this man refuses to see that what he's saying and doing is *hurtful*. He refuses to apologize. It's like my lost babies don't matter and we just need to move on and make more. I know it's hard for people to understand that pregnancy after loss doesn't cure all of the grief and sadness about losses if they haven't been there. It's even harder if those people are emotionally inept.\n\nSo, that said, has anyone encountered similar difficulties? Am I being overly sensitive?

I Oed the 27th with a temp dip which would put me at 10DPO. \n\n**[My Chart](http://tinypic.com/r/2mrrxgk/8)**\n\n\nHello! I am new here. I\u2019ve been lurking around everywhere lately and finally decided to post. This whole experience can be a pretty lonely and depressing one and I don\u2019t think anyone can really understand the extreme amounts of mental and emotional stress one goes through unless they go through it themselves. Company/Advice would be awesome!\n\nA little about me: I\u2019m turning 26 this year. My husband is 24. I was diagnosed with PCOS when I was 13 after dealing with extremely bad medical issues due to my insulin being out of check for a long time. I was told last year that with my blood sugar rising and crashing the way it does if I do not get myself in check I would die by 40. My ovaries were 4 times and 5 times (R and L side) bigger than they should be with massive cysts. I did not ovulate except for once a year and did not have periods. \nSince then I have gone from 280 to 170 lbs (I have gained 20 lbs since Christmas so now I'm 190 ): ) doing the low carb/keto diet. All of my blood panels have come back really good. I have been regular for 6 months now!\n\nMy losses: When I was 21 I lost a bunch of weight (270 down to 150) and got my PCOS under control. I began to have normal periods. This is when I met my husband and we ended up accidently getting pregnant thinking that I couldn\u2019t. We were ecstatic knowing this may be my only chance to have a baby. I ended up miscarrying (very heavily and very badly at the ER) the day after I got my BFP (what a kick in the balls). That one almost killed me because my sister in law was born the month I miscarried and I ended up being her temporary care giver. Being in a bad place with my own mother and watching a newborn, Mother\u2019s Day that year was the most alone and emotionally fucked up I had felt in my entire life. \n\nMy second loss happened around the time my husband\u2019s 15 year old cousin \u201caccidently\u201d got pregnant because she found out her BF was cheating on her and didn't want to lose him(I think if there is a God he is fucking with me hard). I was not around for her son\u2019s birth (though I saw photos on FB) and thank goodness for that because I do not think mentally I could have handled it. \n\nMy third loss happened in the middle of my 12 hour shift at work while I was lifting a patient. That was by far the most physically painful loss. I did not know I was pregnant at the time so it wasn\u2019t as bad as the first two.\n\nMy most recent loss happened this January. This one nearly broke my heart completely in two. My husband and I have been waiting (im)patiently for a little one for five years now. We have a parenting plan laid out, names picked out, and everything set to go. We both want this badly. When my period became regular I was so excited to be late. I got my BFP and had all the signs. It was amazingly blissful. Since we have been working with an RE for a year now they told me immediately to get in for a blood/progesterone test (I have an extremely high miscarriage rate due to progesterone/PCOS). The day I was supposed to get my results from the blood draw I began bleeding everywhere. Literally the second I wiped I got a call from the lab and they apologized saying that I was not carrying a viable pregnancy and my levels were really low. I told them that I was bleeding and they told me when I was ready to come in and we could begin treatments. I was waiting for my insurance to kick in on the first of March.\n\n\n\n\n\n**[If you read anything: This would be the most appreciated]** \n\nWhat\u2019s going on now/Advice is needed: \n\nFor 6 months now I have been regular. My average period length is 35 days. Last cycle in Feb was a little screwy due to miscarriage. Anyways, husband and I went into the RE\u2019s office for lots of testing on 4/4. I was 4 days late. \n\nI told Dr I had been charting my temps. My temp dipped to 97.6 on the 27th of March (My last period was 2/23 through 2/28) but raised up to 99.5 and has been staying in the 99 range consistently high all week. I was due the 30th of March for my period and it is still not here (unless I was supposed to start later since I Oed later than I thought I was supposed to ). My face feels warm and flushed. My boobs hurt. I've been having creamy cm, small cramps. I feel like I want to throw up through the day but don't. Headaches. Hungry and thirsty and peeing a lot. I have been waking up in the middle of the night to pee and in the morning I have to go so bad it hurts. I am extremely bloated. I have been having very vivid dreams (Some zombie dreams/some pregnancy dreams. Last night I kept dreaming that I kept touching my bump and feeling the hard part where baby was) \n\nWell, first they tested husband (which was a hilarious experience) and told us that his sperm count was 130 mil and mobility was 69%. They said this was really good because they want the numbers to be at least 20 mil and 50%. Next they did my ultrasound. She told me that my ovaries have shrunk (though were a little enlarged still) and I did not have any major cysts. She told me that my lining was very thick. With me only being 4 days late that could be a good sign. She told me if I do not start by the 16th they want me to come in for provera and we will go the femara (Clomid overstimulated my ovaries last time I tried it) route and I will have to inject myself with ovidrel. She ushered me off to get bloods done. \n\nThey called me yesterday with my blood results. They told me that my progesterone was lvl 11 (I took the blood test within an hour of eating and I heard that could make your levels go down by 50%) and my blood work shows that I definitely ovulated by myself this month! I tested at 1 day late BFN and then again at 4 days late BFN. I\u2019m not sure I can mentally handle another loss (especially with three of my sister in laws currently being pregnant and the family buzzing over baby shit) and I am very scared/worried/have nobody to talk to about this. My husband wants me to be pregnant but has the mentality that I am killing myself thinking about it and I\u2019m either pregnant or not so why think about it? But ladies, **IT\u2019s ALL I CAN DO**. I don\u2019t think anyone understands that like someone who is TTCing with fertility problems does. \n\nAnyways, I am confused.  Am I feeling PMS and not pregnancy symptoms? Is that progesterone and thick lining and the temps normal to be that high before period or is there any kind of chance this could be my cycle? This is all I have been thinking about because I am impatient and just want to know right now. I know once I find out I am all I will worry about is losing it and not getting progesterone fast enough. But, my levels have never been that high and we have never caught my ovulation with my RE like this before so of course I am all spazzing out.\n\nIt\u2019s great to meet you all!

I hope this doesn't seem like drama or attention mongering; I really just need to vent about this to people who will understand, and I'm too ashamed to talk about it further with anyone IRL.\n\nOne day when I was pregnant with what would turn out to be my second loss, I got an email that brought up a lot of negative emotions from a trauma in my past. I did what I could to mitigate the damage, but that night, I couldn't stop thinking about it and ended up having a panic attack. During the panic attack, I had some mild contractions and started freaking out that I was having a miscarriage. I was then panicking about the panic attack (yay, panic snowball) and thinking how awful it was that trauma from so long ago was going to rob me of my baby, in addition to everything else it had already taken from me. My body felt so heavy, and I had the worst, darkest, cold-burning, empty feeling in my abdomen (sorry, it's hard to describe). I was finally able to settle down and fall asleep around 3 am and then felt mostly okay the next day.\n\nAt the scan where we found out the baby was dead, they told me approximately how far along he/she had developed. When I counted back the days, it turned out to be either exactly or just after the time of my panic attack. Of course my mind jumped to my panic attack as the cause of the miscarriage. I feel like if I were more \"put together\" as a person, maybe this would never have happened. Maybe if I weren't so weak, my baby would still be here. What if I get pregnant again and then something else makes me panic and that baby dies too?\n\nOf course my doctor has assured me that my panic attack could not have caused my miscarriage. And as DH said to me, if all it took to end a pregnancy was panicking about things, the human race would never have survived, and undesired pregnancies would never be an issue.\n\nI still can't help but wonder, though.\n\nI'm shaking and almost crying even writing this out.

Since I don't know which thread this should go in, I am making my own.  \n\nI went in today for my appointment to receive the medication to initiate my miscarriage after blighted ovum diagnosis last week.  Last week, just a gestational sac was found, no fetal pole or yolk sac.  \n\nToday I saw a different doctor, since I was supposed to be part of this research study thing.  She did an ultrasound to confirm there is no viability before giving me the medication.  She was very quiet while doing the scan.  I assumed that meant everything was more or less the same.  At one point, she said \"Did they find a yolk sac last week?\" and I told her no, they did not.  She didn't say anything, just kept clicking around, printed a few images.  At last, she took the wand out, and said her findings were inconsistent with last week's scan.  Today she found a yolk sac and a 2 mm fetal pole.  There was no heartbeat, but she said it looked like a normal pregnancy at 6 week 2 days, so given that, she obviously won't give me the medication. \n\nWhich would be great news, except it doesn't add up at all because\n\n1) I was tracking ovulation with temping and OPKs, clearly pinpointed my ovulation date, and should be 8 weeks pregnant now\n\n2) Even if my charting was completely wrong, I got my first positive pregnancy test almost 5 weeks ago, on March 7\n\n3) My HCG beta two weeks ago was over 25,000 - way too high if I was only 4 weeks at that time\n\nI don't know what to think.  I am trying really hard not to let myself feel hopeful.  Given my points above, it seems impossible I could be 6 weeks pregnant now.  But at the same time, it seems like it has to be a good sign if there has been growth and development in the last week! \n\nDamnit, I feel like I am going insane.  Can anyone make sense of this?  Ever heard of anything so crazy?  I am going to be in limbo for yet another week, then go in for another ultrasound.  At that point there should DEFINITELY be a heartbeat if there is any chance of viability.
