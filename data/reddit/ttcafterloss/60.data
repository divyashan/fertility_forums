Never saw a heartbeat and Dr suggested my really high HCG (73,000!) could be an additional indicator of chromosomal issues with this one. This of course happens quite randomly. However, this is the third miscarriage for my partner. The previous two were with different women and both ended around the same time and a heartbeat was never detected.\n\nOur miscarriage could just be bad luck, however after three where he's the common denominator, he's quite convinced there's something wrong with him.

Was going to post this in the daily thread but realized it was becoming a huge novel so decided to make my own post. Hold onto your butts ladies. It's a long one. Prepare for my brain's overload to just vomit forth:\n\nI'm frustrated. I'm having doubts over the direction the OB/GYN is choosing to take with my treatment. A month ago we saw the OB after the MRI and he said without a doubt we have PCOS and that might be our major issue with conceiving the last year. He decided we were going to go conservative in our approach and start using Letrozole (Femara) for 3 months to see if we could get me to ovulate and get me pregnant. If in 3 months there's no sign of a baby then we would reevaluate then.\n\nI'm now having doubts. DH and I were like bunnies last month. Every other day (occasionally we did every day because holy hormones batman!) we would get down and funky. I felt all kinds of screwed up in the last 7-10 days before my period, more than my usual PMS symptoms and swore up and down I was pregnant. Boobs hurt, and were much larger, stomach was all kinds of funny feeling. Emotional as balls and would go from exploding with happy over silly stupid things to just sobbing like an idiot over something trivial (walked out of daycare drop off when my son wanted the harmonica from another little there. He looked at me and had this completely heartbroken huge pout on his face. Normally I would have been fine seeing that, sad for him, but fine. We walked out the door and I burst into tears. Not. Normal.) Yet my period showed up with such ferocity that it started these doubts.\n\nI'm now on day 3 of my second course of Letrozole and it's different this time. Or maybe it's just I know what to expect so this isn't so weird and new and exciting like last month. I don't know. But I'm starting to wonder if I shouldn't just push for the surgery anyways. He said the cyst that everyone was so so so scared about was about 2.5cm. So like the size of a small grape to put into regular people terms. But while he was going to do surgery to remove this cyst he was also going to get \"all up in my junk\" and do a therapeutic D&amp;C and also take a look at my tubes to see if they were blocked or something.\n\nNow a month later and much time in my own head, I'm wondering if something wasn't missed in the original miscarriage treatment which is causing issues conceiving. That my uterus itself is now inhospitable because there was something super minor left behind that is making my body go \"nah we don't need you tiny fertilized egg! GTFO\" but there isn't enough to cause a positive pregnancy test, stop my period etc. \n\nThe other thing I have floating around in my head is I remember my periods from before having my son, they were very painful for the first day or two, where I would then pass pretty much my entire uterine lining all in one go. Cramps would be instantly gone and it would be another 2-5 days of slowly lessening bleeding before we got back to business as usual free of absorbent \"stuff\" down there. I realized this past period, I don't know the last time I had a period like that. But I can't pinpoint the exact timing of when that all stopped. Was it after I had my son? And this is just my new normal after having a child of my own? Or was this after the miscarriage? I can't honestly pinpoint it on the timeline of my last 2.5 years but there was, at some point, a very clear shift between my period \"before\" and my periods \"after\". \n\nNow that I'm really into monitoring \"all of the things\" when it comes to fertility (CM, cramping, cervical positioning and firmness/open/closed status etc) I've noticed my cervix constantly feels much lower than I ever remember it being. And most specifically since the miscarriage. So I'm wondering now am I having a mild prolapse that somehow no one saw between multiple different types of imaging (U/S and MRI specifically) as well as a regular physical with my GP? Is that a thing? Could that be missed so easily? So now I'm wondering if maybe my cervix is causing my husband's swimmers to miss the mark completely because they simply aren't able to find where they are supposed to go? Has everything shifted positioning so much that the shedding of my uterine lining gotten fucked up and that is causing some kind of blockage for the swimmers, and/or my body rejecting the possibility of carrying a pregnancy now?\n\nI'm a bundle of questions and no answers. Yes, I know, I need to see the doctor and have a word vomit of all of these questions and concerns, but I'm a person who always puts others first, and I don't want to \"take an appointment slot away from someone who needs it's *more* than I do. I'm not having any *real* issues right now. Maybe someone else needs it *more* than me so I won't bother until after next month if we don't get pregnant\"\n\nTl;Dr - I have noticed changes, not sure when they happened. Could these things be real or are they all in my head? Did the original Dr from my care during the miscarriage miss something that is causing my infertility now and not having surgery is just prolonging this issue?

I have this app that\u2019s sole purpose is for venting and people can interact with the posts and dm all that stuff. So I saw this post saying something like \u201cpeople under the age of 25 shouldn\u2019t be having kids, it\u2019s a lot of responsibility, those people are selfish\u201d a lot of stuff like that, very rude. I decided to comment on the post, my own experience, to see if maybe viewing it from another perspective could change her mind or open her up to a different view of it. Basically just told her that two years ago I accidentally fell pregnant and sadly miscarried two months in, put a huge strain on me and my partner but we\u2019ve spent the last two years working our asses off trying to make our future happen and we\u2019re finally starting to try. Her response was so horrible and rude. She said something along the lines of I\u2019m insane if I think I\u2019m prepared to care for a baby, it\u2019s something you\u2019re never prepared for. As if I don\u2019t already know that, who the hell has ever been 100% PREPARED for a baby, we don\u2019t know what we\u2019re doing until it happens. That doesn\u2019t mean I don\u2019t think I\u2019ll be a wonderful mother because I know I will. She also looked back at my posts from months and months ago when I was in a very vulnerable place, I\u2019m not proud of it but whenever I saw girls from my Facebook announcing pregnancies I just couldn\u2019t ever handle it and I would delete them, I couldn\u2019t bare to see all the posts about their baby. I would get really mad sometimes just over the fact these girls had what I lost. So she called me a jealous bitch. That hurt as I don\u2019t actually hate or have any ill feelings towards these people, I explained it\u2019s part of the grieving process. If any of you ladies have never been triggered by seeing everyone around you having children then you\u2019re very strong and I respect you a lot. She also must have not realised I\u2019ve waited two years before trying again but she said I was disgusting for trying to replace my lost baby with another and that I need to grieve first. that made me mad. Nothing will replace her ever. I told her I\u2019ve waited two years and the grieving process never ends once you lose a baby and also she should never judge someone on how quickly or slowly they start trying again after a loss, so so so so ignorant of her. \n\nI\u2019m so sorry for even making this post I\u2019m just so upset and angry that I even got myself into that conversation.

So a short background first.\n\nI came off of BC July of last year. The hubs an I decided to just let nature take its course and if it happened great, if not that is fine as well. I found myself caring more and more as the months have rolled by. But life got crazy busy and we maybe weren't trying as hard as we could. Fast forward to 2ish weeks ago, my BF mentions she thinks she might be preggers, and I comment how I was pretty late, as in 50 days late. And the previous monthly visitor was light spotting. So I finally got a chance to purchase test and it came back BFP, another one did and then next day the same. Needless to say I was THRILLED. This all happened over the holiday weekend (Memorial Day) so I couldn't do anything to call the doc till Tues morning. Math was coming back that I was probably 8 weeks or so. I call Tues get an appointment for last Thurs. My DH and I go and get blind\\-sided by them telling us that the urine test was coming up BFN. I was heartbroken and totally lost. Doc wanted to test my blood and see what it came back, so Fri was told I was at hCG 33. And wanted me back Sat morning to test again and came back Mon saying it was down to 30 and progesterone went from .4 to .2. They state that is a MC but I STILL haven't had any bleeding since the first week of April. And I haven't heard from the doc AT ALL. Only communication I have gotten is from the lab.\n\nThey have me scheduled to come in again for my blood to get tested again on Monday morning. But in the meantime I feel like I am just out here with my ass blowing in the wind. I have GFs commenting about how I am in such a bad mood, or plopping down to tell me how they think they are preggers just because she gagged on her toothbrush that am.. And I am over here angry and lost. I did jump on amazon and got some OPK and I did just purchase the AVA bracelet like a month ago because I was wanting to start to figure out what was up with my body, clearly not knowing that we already had a BFP.\n\nSo with all that being said... Should I be worried that I still haven't had any sign of AF coming? My doc seems to not give a crap. I off course am scared that my body hasn't cleared itself out yet and I have read that I could get a infection. And clearly the friends I have are not super helpful.   \nSorry for the wall of text.

I'm fairly new here and I'm sorry because this will be long but I need to vent. \n\n(Tldr version: drug addict brother's drug addict baby mama gave birth to a healthy baby boy and I am here about to burry my baby boy and my mom decided to tell me all about it despite it being extremely hard for me to hear.)\n\n A week and a half ago I found out my baby boys heart had stopped beating at 24 weeks gestation. I had just heard his heartbeat 6 days before, but went in because I hadn't felt him move in a day or so. And I found out he was no longer living. I gave birth 8 days ago to the most perfect little boy with seemingly nothing wrong with him other than the fact that he wasn't alive. We have no answers as to what could have happened and my husband and I are completely devestated. \n\nMy mom came to stay with us the last couple days to help me around the house, help with my kids, and help us plan his funeral. This morning she was leaving to go back home. And after she got everything packed, she started talking about my brother. My brother is a 35 year old drug addict who is just about the worst person in the world. My mom doesn't know this, but he tried to molest me when I was a girl. He's abusive to every girlfriend he has ever had, to me, my other siblings, to my parents and to his 13 year old daughter that my parents have raised since she was a baby. His baby mama (they are not together because he is abusive) just gave birth to a baby boy sometime in the last week or so. My mom decided to talk all about how this baby could be what my brother needs to get away from herion. And how luckily the baby doesn't have to suffer widthdrals because the baby mama stopped doing herion before he was born.... It broke my heart to hear about their healthy baby boy after the mom was doing hard drugs and smoking throughout the Pregnacy. Meanwhile I was was perfectly healthy through my pregnancy. Never even had a sip of alcohol and I've never smoked in my life and my baby died... I began to cry... My mom kept going on and on about him while I was crying, not taking the hint.\n\nThen I find out that my family told my mom not to tell me about their baby because it would be too hard for me to hear. She did anyway. And she planned it to be right before she left. I feel like she gets off on other people's sadness. Not two minutes after she left, she called my sister to tell her about how she told me and I cried and how dramatic it all was.

My partner barely wants to have sex once week let alone every other day, so I feel like he isn't even trying anymore. I know he's probably stressed as well but I'm trying really hard not to blow a fuse.  \n\nI feel really let down with how he handled the miscarriage as well. Obviously we were both hurting, he took 2 days off work when we found out about the missed miscarriage to sit with me. But the weekend I started to miscarry naturally he had left to watch a sports game with friends. I texted him to say I was miscarrying but he stayed out anyway and never came home that night. The miscarriage lasted 2 weeks, the following weekend he went out drinking with friends again, said he didn't like to see me in pain. He's pretty much been out every single weekend since, sometimes I go with him, at first I would feel a little emotional but I've learnt to cope with it now. 3 weeks after the miscarriage he told me I should be over it by now and to stop using it as an excuse to start arguments because it was his loss too. I just feel like I'm expressing myself.\n\nWe've booked a holiday with his family, I would have been 8 months when we depart. We initially didn't book the holiday because I was pregnant, but since I lost the baby everyone said we may as well have something to look forward to, I don't know why but that really grates on me. I lost a baby, a holiday isn't going to make me feel better about that. I even feel like my boyfriend is more excited about the holiday than he ever was about the baby.\n\nMy co worker is also halfway through her pregnancy, which is gutting for me. No one at work knew about my pregnancy or the miscarriage (I didn't want to harm my chances of job progression until it was safe to announce my plans for a family), so I have to plaster a smile on my face and ask her all the pregnancy related questions that people should have been asking me.\n\nMy boyfriends cousin is also pregnant, I was due within the same week as her. It kills me to see her happy and pregnant. We had a family party recently and I got so disastrously drunk because I just couldn't cope. I feel like such a mess right now with no one to talk to. I just feel like I won't be happy now until I finally have a baby of my own.\n\nMy due date is approaching as well which is just making it all 10 times worse. I've rejoined the gym and go every day just for something to take my mind off this pain. Instead of watching my belly swell I'm now getting thinner. It's a really odd feeling when my co workers and friends are congratulating me on how slim I look when all i want is that round belly. If only the knew the truth.\n\nJust my ramblings for the day.", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "ttcafterloss", "subreddit_id": "t5_34scd", "subreddit_subscribers": 3386, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "5 Months After Loss and Still Struggling", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/ttcafterloss/comments/8q1e2k/5_months_after_loss_and_still_struggling/"}, {"author": "amiamermaid", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1528647135, "domain": "self.ttcafterloss", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/ttcafterloss/comments/8q1t55/a_metaphor_from_my_nonsports_husband_that_helps/", "gilded": 0, "id": "8q1t55", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 10, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/ttcafterloss/comments/8q1t55/a_metaphor_from_my_nonsports_husband_that_helps/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1528647137, "rte_mode": "markdown", "score": 40, "selftext": "I remember the first time I got pregnant, we lost it 11 days later.

We had actually said the week he must have been conceived... let's wait until I graduate. That was in 2014-15. Then, we wanted to give him a sibling. \n\nIn June of 2017, we had a chemical (maybe? I heard FRER had a bad batch and threw lots of false positives). We were standing in the kitty aisle of petsmart and I just broke down sobbing. He held me and said \"You know, it's just a swing and a miss. There are so many things that have to go right to keep a baby in there, it's like a pitcher and a batter. I'm the pitcher, you're the batter. Your body stance, your swing speed, all of it has to match what I do. You swung, hard, and the ball almost connected. We'll swing again, and someday, we'll make the connection.\" It has really helped me cope with miscarriages and its funny because he hates baseball. But a chemical is a swing and a miss, an early loss is a caught ball because you barely get off homebase, and a missed miscarriage is a foul ball because you made the connection and then ran like mad.

Just a quick introduction, I am 35, married for almost 5 yrs to my DH. I own my own business, plus manage a cute little boutique here in town (needless to say, I work A LOT). My DH and decided 11 months ago to come off of BC. We haven't tried super crazy, just because life has been completely insane. But I find myself each month a little more upset when AF comes. I have kept up with my cycle in an app for about 7 months, but honestly beyond that I didn't really know what to look for. I did get the AVA bracelet about 2 months ago but I really haven't done much with it besides wear it and then not bother looking at the results. So fast forward to about 2 and a half weeks ago. After AF being 50\\+ days late, a gf bugged me for a few days straight to take a PT and it came back a BFP, plus 3 more did. So in doing math I was thinking I could very well be 8 weeks along. So I called the doc but they couldn't see me for about a week. We go in for the appointment, only to be told by the nurse when I was brought back, that she was confused as to why I was there for a pregnancy when my test came back negative. Needless to say, I felt like I had been slapped in the face and totally blindsided me. So bloodwork came back last week showing I was, but that I had M/C. \\&lt;/3 So after a week of feeling sorry for myself, I picked myself up and decided to learn as much as I can about my cycle and jump right back on the horse.  I know I need to lose weight, it has always been a goal but a hard one, but now it is SUPER important to me. \n\nAnyways, thank you for reading my long wall of text. I honestly feel a bit silly at 35 realizing that I am clueless as to how my body works. So I am looking forward to learning everything I can.

I don't feel like I'm particularly anxious or depressed anymore, I just have my days.\n\nAfter everything happened, because of having my right tube removed, and being told by the surgeon that my remaining tube was scarred pretty badly, I began to look into my other options. Not because I was ready to explore them then and there, but just to reassure myself that there was still hope for the future of me being a mother, and that this was not necessarily the end of the road. I explored the options of adoption, and gestational surrogacy as these seemed the most likely options for my personal situation.\n\nMy S/O was not supportive of either. He did not like the idea of trusting someone else with safely carrying our child via gestational surrogacy. We are both very health conscious and part of his reasoning stems from the fact that obviously you cannot control what another puts in their mouth or exposes themselves to, and having a person carrying your child would increase the anxiety of worrying about every little thing they do. I completely understand his point on this.\n\nThe other option, adopting...He was very against this as well. I have heard of a lot of men who have a similar stance. Something to do with them not being their blood...worrying that the child would have 'issues' as many adopted children/adults that we have known personally have...But I also know several adopted children/adults who DO NOT have 'issues' and actually recognize that they are tremendously loved because they were 'hand picked' so to speak.\n\nNow it has been almost 2 months since everything happened. My S/O and I have been living together and in a relationship for around 5 years and have known each other for almost 20 years. We used to be the 'we don't need to be legally married to prove our love' type couple. But after looking into requirements for adoption and discovering that many countries prefer couples to have been married for at least 5 years...My stance has changed. Yesterday, I went to have lunch with him at work, and told him that I wanted him to consider us getting married, so that if one day in the future, we decided we wanted to adopt we would already be ahead and wouldn't have to wait 5 years to do so. I am almost 26 and he is 24 so 5 years from now would put us at 31 and 29. A lot can change in that time. He once again said that he does not want to adopt. I asked him 'what if that was the only way I could be a mother?' And he said that maybe it means that I wasn't meant to be a mother.\n\nI guess it just hurts me that he is so dismissive of these ideas. I do not by any means want to force him into either of these ideas. I would never want a child who had already been given up to not be truly wanted by one of their adoptive parents. Our pregnancy that ended in the ectopic was unplanned, but it did reaffirm that I definitely want to be a mother one day, even though I already knew that. \n\nWhen we found out about the pregnancy, we both started scrambling to 'get our lives together' in preparation for the baby. He started working full\\-time and enrolled in online school for criminal justice (he wants to be a cop in the next couple years). I re\\-enrolled in college to finish the last course for my B.A. At this point it just makes me sad, because I know if things had worked out, I would be 4 months pregnant right now, and he would be excited about being a father like he was before things went south. I don't know the right way to go about revisiting these subjects, or helping him to understand why I feel like marriage and/or gestational surrogacy and/or adoption are so important to me. \n\nIf anyone has any similar experiences or advice, I am open to anything right now. I'm not trying to push him so I have been choosing wisely how often to bring these things up.", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "ttcafterloss", "subreddit_id": "t5_34scd", "subreddit_subscribers": 3397, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "S/O does not want to consider other avenues of having kids and I'm sad", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/ttcafterloss/comments/8qlh1q/so_does_not_want_to_consider_other_avenues_of/"}, {"author": "AutoModerator", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1528873941, "domain": "self.ttcafterloss", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/ttcafterloss/comments/8qqghu/ttcafterloss_ttc_daily_discussion_thread_june_13/", "gilded": 0, "id": "8qqghu", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 37, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/ttcafterloss/comments/8qqghu/ttcafterloss_ttc_daily_discussion_thread_june_13/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1528873943, "rte_mode": "markdown", "score": 2, "selftext": "**This thread is for members who are TTC or waiting to try.

A MMC at 16 weeks (baby measured 12) last October and twins at 8 weeks in February.  After the twins I ended up having to get a d&amp;c 7 weeks later for retained products. I got my period back after four weeks, went back to my doctor to get another saline ultrasound and confirm everything was clear. It was so we were able to resume ttc. This was the first cycle back ttc and nothing. Got my period last Sunday. I had been feeling better prior to that. I was glad to finally have the last MC behind me and looking ahead optimistically. Well, when my period arrived my optimism when down the toilet hard. I had already had plans to go to dinner with some friends the other night, one of whom is pregnant. I didn't really want to but forced myself. Then was stuck sitting there hearing her complain about pregnancy.  And she has had fertility struggles!  Everyone there knew about my losses. So that broke me a little more. Add to that another friend texted me that she's pregnant. She also knows about my losses and has been a good about checking in on me and a good ear when Ive needed it.  I knew that she'd been trying. I am happy for her. But it was super triggering to hear that and now I feel completely shattered. I'm also supposed to get lunch with this newly pregnant friend in a few days and I know I'm not going to be able to. I feel awful that she's been there to listen about my losses but I'm not at all going to be able to handle hearing about her pregnancy until maybe I'm pregnant again myself. How can I even explain that?  She has not had any losses. \n\nI am so anxious, sad, crushed, heartbroken, and angry at my stupid body right now.  I've been eating healthy for months, taking supplements, trying to make my body the best it can be. It should be me. I deserve to finally get a viable pregnancy. I have my two LC to look after and for me that does not work to distract.  If anything I am distracted by my emotions and it's making it hard to be a good mom right now.  I'm so worried that my high anxiety will mess up ttc this cycle  and month after month it will just compound and spiral. \n\nThis is mostly just a vent.  Thanks for reading/listening.  I need to get this out to anyone who will understand. How did you get through stuff like this? I feel like the only thing that will make it better is to just wallow in my feelings.

I am by no means ready physically, mentally or emotionally ready to start down that road but I'm just curious if it's even an option.\n\nBackground:\nThis was our second pregnancy. Our first pregnancy ended in a miscarriage at 10 weeks requiring a D&amp;C (June 9th 2017). During this pregnancy they noted I had a little elevated blood pressure around 8 weeks which continued to climb. By 16 weeks I was put on blood pressure medication. At 23+2 I was hospitalized because my blood pressure reached 237/115. I was discharged on bed rest four days later but ended up going back after another 4 days and was admitted for hospital bed rest with constant monitoring. During this I was pricked every 4-6 hours for blood labs to check liver enzymes and kidney function. At 26+2 I began having the dreaded upper right quadrant pain and my liver enzymes started to climb. Our beautiful boy was born via emergency C-section at 26+3(May 6th) due to high liver enzymes and a declining platelet count. We had a very emotional 40 days in the NICU until we had to say goodbye to our Superman (June 14th). His lungs were severally underdeveloped even with two rounds of steroid injections due to IUGR. I'm still recovering physically from the HELLP syndrome. Emotionally I'm dealing with the trauma of almost dying, dealing with the NICU rollercoaster, and mostly losing our baby boy way too soon.", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "ttcafterloss", "subreddit_id": "t5_34scd", "subreddit_subscribers": 3416, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "HELLP syndrome and subsequent pregnancy", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/ttcafterloss/comments/8rmpsx/hellp_syndrome_and_subsequent_pregnancy/"}, {"author": "Hungry_Albatross", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1529205300, "domain": "self.ttcafterloss", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/ttcafterloss/comments/8rodsa/fathers_day_with_no_living_children/", "gilded": 0, "id": "8rodsa", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 30, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/ttcafterloss/comments/8rodsa/fathers_day_with_no_living_children/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1529205301, "rte_mode": "markdown", "score": 23, "selftext": "Looking to see what you ladies with no living children are doing for Father's Day.

I just can't figure out what to do to show him that baby loved him just like I do.", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "ttcafterloss", "subreddit_id": "t5_34scd", "subreddit_subscribers": 3416, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Father's Day with no living children", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/ttcafterloss/comments/8rodsa/fathers_day_with_no_living_children/"}, {"author": "AutoModerator", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1529219536, "domain": "self.ttcafterloss", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/ttcafterloss/comments/8rphsj/ttcafterloss_ttc_daily_discussion_thread_june_17/", "gilded": 0, "id": "8rphsj", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 7, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/ttcafterloss/comments/8rphsj/ttcafterloss_ttc_daily_discussion_thread_june_17/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1529219537, "rte_mode": "markdown", "score": 3, "selftext": "**This thread is for members who are TTC or waiting to try.
