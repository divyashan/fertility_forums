Husband was able to come (thank goodness) because he wanted to see the ultrasound. Some friends of ours told us that we would be able to see an actual baby and he couldn't wait. It almost wasn't meant to be because he took too long to get ready and I almost left without him because I was worried about being late. I am so grateful I didn't do that.   \n\nAfter a short talk, my doctor had me lie down for an ultrasound, saying the baby was now big enough to see through my belly. She didn't see anything but said it could be because my bladder was empty and not to worry because it would definitely work during my next visit.   \n\nSo, I moved so she could use the trans-vaginal u/s. I can't forget just how happy I was when I first saw him. Little arms, little legs, everything. Then, she asked how far along I was. When I told her, she said that he was way too small. She then moved the wand all around trying to find a heartbeat. Nothing. I could tell she was shocked and just kept telling me how sorry she was.   \n\nHe had been dead for a week and my body didn't realize. To be honest, I didn't know that could happen. I thought miscarriages always came with blood and cramps. Plus, I still **felt** pregnant. I still had morning sickness (no more killer heartburn, but the 1st trimester was almost over and people kept telling me I would start feeling better soon) and my hormones weren't going crazy (another 'surefire' sign everyone kept telling me).  \n\nI felt betrayed. By my body for keeping the fetus for so long. By 'society' for not talking about miscarriages in a way that actually lets you know the different ways it could happen. By everything, really.   \n\nHad my D&amp;C yesterday. I didn't want to wait for it to happen naturally and my doctor was concerned that it hadn't happened already. While it was technically easy, it was still very hard. In the recovery room I could hear some of the women crying when they woke up from the anesthesia.   \n\nThis turned into a very long post but I just don't have the heart to leave anything out.

My boobs have been feeling worse as well, it feels a bit like someone is stabbing them.\n\nI'm actually pretty paranoid that something was missed during the D&amp;C.

Obviously even if everything was back in working order by that point it would be way to early for it to be causing my symptoms.\n\nIf my nausea continues (which seems likely at this point) should I go into my GP Monday for blood tests? Or do I just try and ride it out until some sort of bleeding shows up? \n\nThanks for any advice. I'm just really tired of feeling sick. I can barely manage taking care of myself.

In no way, shape or form do I really believe and want these things, I'm just so hurt, which is still no excuse. God, this may seem so petty to you guys. In middle school we all have the one person we can't stand. Well, my person, let's call her Ann, we would literally scream at each other across the class room. She bullied me on my birthday, she was just always rude. I was always around her as my friends liked her. Well, we eventually became friends on Facebook. She announced she was pregnant, almost 12 weeks along. At this point I was about 5 or 6. I didn't really feel anything, good or bad. After my miscarriage, the anger and jealously has just grown and grown. Here I am, in a perfect relationship, studying to get a job, and here she is on and off again with her SO, between jobs, and smoking weed. I feel like I deserve it so much more, I would be a better mom. From middle and high school, I'd expect her to teach her kids to be a raging bitch all the time. All she did was complain on Facebook about pregnancy symptoms and fights with her SO. Eventually I deleted but still tortured myself with pictures of her ultrasounds and \"gender party\". I know all these thoughts are just jealousy and anger, but God I feel so bad for just wishing such bad things on her. Guys, I have to shamefully admit, I even at one point in my head wished she lost the baby so she could feel my pain. How messed up is that? I knew how hard it was to lose your baby, so why was I hoping it for her? These thoughts have been getting lighter but I just can't get her facebook page out of my head. We shared the same best friend and I slowly lost him to her. I had to see pictures of them together and him supporting her, but never once a congratulation message from him. Not that I'd expect it from everybody, but we both helped each other through deep depression in middle school and I thought we were just in a way, still close. Please, please tell me one of you has turned into satan and has a heart of stone like me. I just need to be reassured that these feelings are just anger and jelousy, and that Im not a bad person for thinking these things. I'm really nervous posting this because I know you all have gone through tremendous losses and are working really hard to get pregnant.", "stickied": false, "subreddit": "ttcafterloss", "subreddit_id": "t5_34scd", "thumbnail": "default", "title": "I just can't be happy for her...

The nausea, the fatigue, the headaches...I just wasn't even entertaining the idea that I could get pregnant, so I thought those were all unrelated...so stupid...\n\nETA: The reason I didn't test earlier was because I truly thought I could not get pregnant.    I had resigned myself to be childless given my age and my complete lack of pregnancies while off bc.  All of my sisters had to go through intense fertility treatments to have their babies and I had decided I did not want to go through all that.

She recommended not trying till the fibroids are  out. If I manage to conceive I'm still at high risk for miscarriage as the placement and size of the fibroids will most likely impact placental development. Big fat sigh. \n\nThe surgery has to be done as close as possible to the last day of bleeding, and the surgeon only does them on Wednesdays, so I'll be waiting till April. After the surgery I'll wait till I get a period, then the doctor will send me for an ultrasound, and if everything is normal, I'll be cleared to try again. So we are looking at May at the earliest. One upside is that she will be using a surgery method that requires only half the dilation of the  traditional surgery method. It will put less stress on my cervix.\n\nThe doctor was really nice. She listened to all my concerns and had thoroughly gone through my health records from Toronto. She told me that she definitely would not be using the watchful waiting method of cervical assessment when I do get pregnant. The tear was at the top of my cervix, and she said that even though it healed, scar tissue could contribute to weakness at the top, and once the top starts opening, the cervix is going to open completely. As far as she is concerned my risk of this happening again is too great to wait.  She suggested a TVCIC which is a type of cerclage placed much higher up the cervix, and is done in pregnancy.  She did suggest getting pregnant as soon as we can after the surgery because the fibroids will grow back, and probably as quickly as they are growing now. She also recommended the Mirena IUD for after I give birth to try to keep my uterus relatively clean till we're ready to have another child. (I was thinking 'do this again? Ha!\u2019)\n\nI'm disappointed (currently weeping in a Starbucks while avoiding eye contact with everyone) but trying to tell myself that this is not as bad as it could be. I'm having some feelings of body anger and frustration with this supposedly easy and natural process (fuck that shit) but I'm trying to focus on step 1 and take it from there.

Totally unexpected to be honest, we only had unprotected sex once and while we weren't actually trying to get pregnant, we weren't trying to prevent anything either. Plus it took me a year to get pregnant with my daughter and there's no way that \"only try once and get it\" thing is going to happen to me. We had just talked about having a second baby, so that was good, right? RIGHT? I wish I could hit rewind and go back to that moment and make a different decision, had I know what was in store for me. \n\nPregnancy symptoms hit me, but seemed.. off. I wasn't nearly as sick as I was with my first pregnancy. Odd, but every pregnancy is different. I actually gained 3 pounds and had an appetite which was also different. Only puked when brushing my teeth so that was a nice change.. but then came the discharge. Or so I thought. My body started telling me this wasn't going to work out. At first I didn't know, and the medical professionals (I want to use that term lightly from the way they handled things) kept telling me everything was fine. I started having more and more \"discharge\". My first ultrasound showed a super tiny.. spaceship-looking thing. The tech asked me \"how far along are you again?\" .. Probably a red flag right there. When I got back to discuss my ultrasound, I was told they needed to do another because I was probably not as far along as I thought I was. That makes me want to punch something because I track my cycles, and they made me feel like I didn't know what I was talking about. \n\nI didn't even get to have that second ultrasound to see the spaceship again. That day would be spent making sure I had \"fully miscarried\" it. The process started on a Sunday. I went to the bathroom and when I wiped, red blood. Knew this was a bad sign. My husband had to leave for 3 days for work so I would be alone with our toddler. I wanted to go to the ER right there but with everyone telling me stuff was fine (even though they ordered HCG testing the Friday before, another red flag) I just didn't know. So that day goes by, and then most of the next. I ended up with a massive migraine the second day my husband was gone. Can't tell you the last time I had one, probably like 14 years ago? I was so beyond sick with it, violently throwing up for hours and hours. I had nothing in my stomach. It was causing me to really put tons of pressure on my stomach.. and I was bleeding more and more. I went to bed early and woke up feeling better around 2 AM.. still bleeding. I woke up my 2 year old and we went to the ER. They checked me, and the doctor couldn't tell me anything basically. My HCG levels were dropping and he didn't see anything on the ultrasound, but tried to play it off like maybe my levels had peaked and the machine was too old or some shit. But I knew.\n\nI had to go through that by myself. My husband came home the next day and he felt really bad about not being around. I honestly can't remember when the actual miscarriage took place, but the \"spaceship\" flew away somewhere around 2-3AM. When I went to my scheduled ultrasound they found everything was gone and I was told that I had a \"nice, clean miscarriage\". Well, thanks..\n\nSo here I am. If I were still pregnant, I'd be having a baby in a few weeks... but I'm not. It's depressing. Time has made things worse almost. To be honest I wasn't as upset when the miscarriage happened, as I totally expected it from what my body was doing and it prepared me for it, but.. it still sucks. This is the third month we've been trying and I'm not expecting to be pregnant with my luck, but.. yeah.

If both are positive it's staph, if one is positive it's most likely contamination. On Tuesday I get a call saying one was positive and one was not, so to come into the ER, don't check in as an ER patient, we'll have you in and out all we need is bloodwork. Not sure why I couldn't go to the lab so I went and ended up waiting about 8 hours in the lobby to get in. Got another call today saying they got the same result and to come back into the ER. I flat out refused, saying no way in hell am I waiting in the ER with the flu again, where I could give it to others and possibly get something else. I ended going across town to a newer urgent care hospital and we had barely sat down before we were called in. At this point I'm freaking out, worried as hell about my health. If it's in my bloodstream it means it's progressed and it's more dangerous. The doctor comes in, asks a few questions, and he's like \"So they just want to keep poking and testing you?\" and I just felt dumb. He said if it was in my blood I would be way sicker and this totally made me feel relieved. They did a lactose or whatever test that came out 0.00, my white blood cells are fine, no real sign of infection. I'm just so pissed I was given the idea of needing this bloodwork ASAP and the hospital refused to see me outside of their packed ER. I'm waiting for this result and I'm fairly certain I'll get a normal result from this hospital. I'm pissed I was freaking out about having staph in my blood and possibly giving it to those waiting in the ER, my boyfriend, my mom, and my sister. They told me at my second visit for the blood that a second contamination is a very little to no chance. I never understood why people hate hospitals but now I get it. This was a complete nightmare, and I got absolutely no information from the first hospital, they made it seem very urgent instead of \"we might have made a mistake\". My family has had a doctor there destroy previous files for an illness he never caught, I don't even feel like I want to go there for prenatal care anymore. Anyways, that's my vent.

She decided I should go to A&amp;E in case something was wrong after the D&amp;C. So up to hospital I went. I ended up having to stay in from Monday to Thursday. I had a kidney infection after the MC, which was what was causing my symptoms. Also HGC levels also hadn't gone down all the way to zero, they were at 10 the last time I was tested. I also have an ovarian cyst, 4.8cm. Apparently that coming on around the same time as the kidney infection didn't help things. \n\nLuckily the antibiotics are working for the infection and I'm feeling a lot better, and am super glad to be home. I have a few side effects from the antibiotics, but overall doing better. Also AF decided to show up at the same time as side effects, which feels lovely. \n\nThanks for reading, and thanks for the advice and concern showed at my previous post.

TL;DR if you need to. \n\nI have my CD3 appointment scheduled for tomorrow, but when I talked to the nurse's desk today they said that my doctor's plan was tentatively to keep me on the same dose of Femara that I was on this past month (2.5 mg).  \n\nThis dose is half the dose that I took in May, which is when I became pregnant with Ethan.  It's also the dose that produced only so-so follicles midway through this cycle, which resulted in just one 18-19mm follicle that ovulated before I could trigger.  These are very similar to the results I got on no medication back in January, and 20mm is usually the minimum my doctor likes to see; 24mm is ideal on this medication.  Given that I only got my IUI in after getting a positive OPK on my own at home (the monitoring appointment I had set up would have wound up being post-ovulation), that I know it happened a day too late, and the the egg was iffy at best...I feel like this was a relative failure of a cycle and that it would be a given that we'd up the dose this coming month to what had worked before.  \n\nMy doctor said she's open to upping the dose, but is concerned about multiple follicles.  The nurse made it clear that if I produce more than one follicle that they will cancel my cycle and, I assume, also tell me to not try getting pregnant on my own.  With my bum cervix they do NOT want me pregnant with multiples, which I agree with. \n\nWeirdly, my doctor also seems to think that this cycle isn't the more-or-less failure I thought it was, since we performed an IUI and my follicle was in the \"mature range,\"  I feel like I know my body, though, and pregnancy was not gonna happen.  Circumstances were not anything even close to like what wound up being successful last year. \n\nSo the question is...what do I ask for next month?  Do I up the dosage back to 5 mg BECAUSE THAT'S WHAT WORKED and I only produced one follicle on it back in May?  Overall, the chances of having twins are less than 1% on Femara anyway... so while my doctor is concerned, and having to cancel a cycle would be devastating, I feel like the chances of this happening are really small.  On the other hand, maybe it's worthwhile to listen to the doc's recommendation and play it cautiously for one more month.  There's also the question going back down to a lower dose is a possibility if a higher dose this month doesn't work.  \n\nI just feel more secure upping the dose...but I don't want to set myself up for an even bigger disappointment later this month if I respond too well to the meds.  I can't figure out what the right course of action is, since I'm surprised my doctor and I didn't think alike this month. \n\nMaybe I'm also mainly frustrated because I should have a fucking baby in my arms and instead I wore the wrong absorbency tampon to school and wound up having a leak in the morning.  Gross.  Luckily I think I caught it before anything got onto my pants...which were black today anyway... ugh.  \n\nMy life sucks.

I don't think I ever posted an official intro before so decided I would do so this time. I apologize in advance for the wall of text, it's a been a long journey for us so far.\n\nWe stopped BC in July planning to officially start trying around September and lucky us, actually conceived that very first cycle in September without even \"trying\" much! We were excited, but almost felt like it was too easy. Well after very minimal symptoms my 7wk scan showed only development at 5w+4. We thought it ok, I'd had long cycles since coming off BC and didn't track anything but CM so could easily be off with the dates. However, 2 weeks later the scan (what should've been 9wk) showed exactly the same, still 5w+4. The diagnosis was MMC. I was given blood tests and called back in for a final confirmation scan and all signs pointed still to MMC. At that point it had already been 4 weeks since the baby stopped growing and my doctor didn't feel comfortable waiting longer to miscarry naturally, so we went ahead with the D&amp;C just before thanksgiving. We actually didn't tell anyone because we didn't want to worry family and they didn't know we were actively TTC. \n\nAnother longish cycle after D&amp;C and we were ready to try again in February. I actually had a short cycle (for me, about 26 days because I ovulated at a normal time finally) so was pretty pumped that my body finally seemed to be regulating after stopping BC and all the other junk it had been through! At 8DPO I got a shockingly dark BFP a and was a little confused but hey, a BFP! Just a few days later, at what I thought was about 3w+4, I had an episode of pretty bad nausea which had me excited thinking things were going well; I'd had no nausea with the first. We had a nice, relaxing trip planned for spring break last week and I was able to put everything aside and not worry about the pregnancy. However, on the last day of the trip I started having some intense abdominal pain associated with a bowel movement. Since we were traveling I couldn't go right away so the pain got pretty intense but subsided after I was able to go. It did seem to be lingering a bit longer on the left though. I knew I'd ovulated on the left (I get mittleschmerz) so was a little concerned then but chalked it up to eating bad food, traveling, and waking up early for the flight. I kept having the feeling of being a bit \"full\" in my abdomen but pain was minimal only seemed a little exaggerated on the left. I rested Sunday when we got back, still felt a little meh but seemed totally in the norm for pregnancy. Google scared myself though and decided if I still felt weird the next day I'd call my doc and ask questions. Well Monday, back at work, I made it a couple hours but started to feel another intense wave of morning sickness. After throwing up twice and spending an hour laying in the back seat of my car with a trash can I drug out of my classroom, I decided I was in no condition to teach (lol) and called in a sub for the second half of the day so I could go see my doctor. Thinking I pribbably had a bad ovarian cyst, those run in my family, they booked me an early US right away. The look on my doctors face when she found the pregnancy, with a heartbeat (which never happened last time) but outside of the uterus was probably the most devastating part. She's very supportive and wants good things for her patients just as much as we do. She even took my hand in her office and, knowing we were both strong in the same religion, prayed with me right then and there. I suppose the bright side is I'm ovulating fine, my hormones are fine, and my husbands sperm are fine. I also seem to have a pretty accurate idea of what's going on in my body and that \"full\" feeling was blood pooling in my abdomen. The bad news is my body seems to like being in the unlikely statistic and I'm now down one Fallopian tube. We obviously won't be trying for another few cycles but I just needed to share my story with someone. As soon as my body is ready we'll be back at it. I'm not quitting until all of my reproductive organs are gone! But for now trying to recover from a laparoscopy and get this awful gas stuck in my ribcage out of my body. \n\nThanks to all of those who read this far for allowing me to share. **TLDR been trying since September with one MMC and now one ectopic pregnancy. The two are unrelated with no fertility issues. My body has just decided to take trolling to a new extreme.

My doctor's told me I lost it due to stress.(Everyone in my family had a nasty bug including me. I also had an infection and I had three teeth taken out last month. I started a new job in which I was a caregiver(and I put my patients as well as everyone else, ahead of myself). Then there was my father's diagnoses of cancer.) (In fact, when I found out about the \"MC\" I waited five days to tell my mom. And I said that it couldn't get worse. Her exact words were: Yes they could bc dad's results came in and he does in fact have cancer.)\n\nSo after consulting with my primary doctor, my ob, and my husband I decided to go back to my job as a stay at home mommy and wife. I left my previous caretaking job totally. So no more stress with that. Since the \"mc\"(I'm sorry that's they only way I can say it w/o bawling) I have been really really down. Blaming myself and resenting myself. Why didn't I do what I did with my first pregnancy, and go on complete bedrest for the first trimester? Why did I have to lose it? Bc I wanted it...God knows I wanted it...And I lost it...I wanted it know it better...And most importantly I wanted that baby...I don't want another... I want the one I had and lost.. But enough of beating myself up over that... I went to my ob and he said I'm good to go, the endometriosis I had was scrapped out when they did my d&amp;c last june. \n\nSo now we are going to start trying again and I'm hesitant especially after what just happened. I scared that it will happen again..And I know that's it's a chance you have to deal with...I'm just still trying to get over the previous one I had. But I've been reading tonight on how to get pregnant faster and some of what I read made sense. But are there any other pointers? Is there anyone who has had a \"mc\" and bounced back into trying to concieve soon afterwards? How did you deal with it? And how did it turn out for you in the long run? Bc this was my first in my life and I'm rather new to the whole idea(and I hate it). Ever since this happened I've felt very inferior as a person and woman (especially.) \n\nBut we are trying now, finally...So any prayers and good vibes I could use right about now.

It isn't really TTC related, but I haven't found as wonderful support than you wonderful people (and other wonderful individuals online, but they're asleep).\n\nI have been crying for hours endlessly every day since I had this dream. Since it happened, I haven't wanted to try to conceive. I am almost repulsed by the thought, and I don't know why. I broke down sobbing tonight after our first ttc-sex for this cycle. I couldn't enjoy the experience and felt sick to my stomach after and cried for hours without knowing why. \n\n**The dream (very long, sorry). ** It mentions infant loss/trigger warning.\n\nI was with my ex from a few years ago. This is the man I fell passionately in love with and first ever became pregnant by. I lost the pregnancy, and after he rejected me and shunned me. However, in my dream I felt such passionate, primal love for him. I had \"returned\" to his house, empty-bellied, hiding my post-pardum belly in shame of the way it looked. I hadn't told him I was pregnant, or that the baby had died\n\nWe were rolling around naked, he wanted to make love but I refused, frustrated with him. He was joking and teasing me.\n\nSo we danced and swirled around each other and I was torn between going into his arms and making love, and being cold and telling him the news. I turned away from him and looked into a mirror and inspected myself. I was wearing a big, poofy dress made of patches of ugly dark fabric, covered by gaudy pink tulle. I hated having to wear it and how I looked. \n\nHe came up behind me and remarked that I looked fat. I said why would you say that? He said because I was pregnant, and that was a very intense, still moment. I said \"Not anymore\", and turned away and went downstairs. \n\nI am standing downstairs and see his mother sitting there, she is disappointed that I am there (and in that situation). She stands and goes to fuss with something. I see a little baby sitting on the floor before me, and I pick her up. She has blue tissue paper wrapped around her torso, and I am carefully holding her so not to touch the skin, only the tissue. She felt so, so real. She just looked at me very still and calm.\n\nMy stepmother appears and I hear her whisper to my ex's mother \"That must be so hard, to be afraid to touch a baby again\" and I knew it was because I had poisoned my son with E.coli at birth with my body.\n\nSo I carefully wrapped the baby in more and more tissue and then set her in a gift bag. \n\nThen strangers began to appear in the house, relatives and friends of his, they were running around spreading excited news. They were handing out announcement sheets and I asked what it said. A blonde lady said that it was news that I had had the baby! Everyone was chattering and more and more people appeared around me, smiling and excited.\n\nI became enraged and yelled \"Kieran is dead.... He is my son.\" The words were very powerful, and I felt such intense love, all the love I could ever feel all at once, for him. \n\nI left the house and was inside a very high-class mall-type building with black glass walls. I was weeping and my dress was ripped, my hair a mess, but I stood head high and looked straight ahead as people stopped to look at me. \n\nTwo old Japanese women wearing pale, shimmering silk dresses approached me with respect and sadness and held my hands, then stepped aside to let me begin my march, which was some tradition for those who's children had died. \n\nI began walking the hallways very formally, crying but still trying to stay graceful and follow the traditional path I was supposed to, and people fled when I came near. I came upon a beautiful blonde woman in a marvellous, gorgeous dress of brilliant colours, bright blues and pinks and yellows, just amazing. I saw her before she saw me and she looked afraid and was crying and was looking around for others to pay attention to her. She saw me approaching and she looked horrified at seeing me and began to weep and turned and fled. \n\nI followed after her, walking, and she ran but every time she turned back I was there, behind her, and she panicked and ran into a corner and curled into a ball. I went to comfort her but she had turned into a crystal statue of a fountain, all the colours of her dress. I knew if I touched it, it would shatter. \n\nSo I walked the rest of the hall alone, and came to where I started. I stood there and the strangers would gawk and whisper to each other about me. \n\nThen I woke up and felt the most intense longing for my son. It was very hard. I haven't been able to shake it since. It's been a few days. \n\nAnyway, I think typing it out will help. Sorry this was so long. I'm not one for interpreting too much from dreams, but I think this was a meaningful one.", "stickied": false, "subreddit": "ttcafterloss", "subreddit_id": "t5_34scd", "thumbnail": "default", "title": "(Off-Topic: Grief)[Triggers maybe]I had a dream and ever since I have feel ripped to emotional shreds.", "url": "http://www.reddit.com/r/ttcafterloss/comments/2zvkrd/offtopic_grieftriggers_maybei_had_a_dream_and/"}]}
