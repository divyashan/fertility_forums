I can't stop bawling.. I posted this on FB.. they knew about my ectopic but not my 1st loss..\n\nSomething most of y'all don't know... I didn't just lose this baby during this ectopic pregnancy. \n\nMay 8th was one of the happiest days of my life. It was the first time I ever had a positive pregnancy test. I told Austin and within days he came home with a cute onsie and baby converse sneakers. We were so excited.. so overjoyed! We told close family immediately. Almost everyone couldn't be happier for us! Then it happened.. I became the one in 4. I went to the er on May 22nd and found out I was having a miscarriage. By may 27th I had passed everything. I had lost our first child. My body couldn't handle it. Couldn't do it's one job and protect our baby that we already loved SO much. I'd thought about writing something on here.. not at all for pity.. but for awareness. For me. It was a life I felt people should know about. Even if no one ever got to meet him or her.. our baby was so loved and so worth knowing about. I hate that miscarriage is so common, and SO heartbreaking, yet women feel like it has to be a secret. Like they aren't allowed to discuss it. I stayed quite about it. Cried for weeks. Let my body heal a little bit.. \n\nThen, it happened again!! So fast too! I was cautiously optimistic. This one would stick. I could get excited but not too excited. And this time I had so many more signs.. I was so nauseous. I hated the taste of Dr pepper. I couldn't brush my teeth without gagging or dry heaving. I threw up. Surely these were good signs... right? Every pain and sickness made me happy because it meant that I was pregnant. \n\nAnd then the day happened.. I saw blood again. I lost it. Cried so hard! This couldn't be happening to us again!! I went to the ER August 3rd to find out my hcg had dropped and I was having my second loss in only 3.5 months.. \n\nBut this time it wasn't just a loss of a baby. It was a loss of a tube. The near loss of my own life.. some might say I'm being dramatic and I say I'm not expressing myself enough. Not only am I physically hurt right now, I am emotionally crushed. And you know what? That is okay. I'm not asking for pity. Just awareness. This happens to so many women who feel they can't speak up about it when it's actually a common thing. \n\nHere are some things I have been told since all of this has happened..\n\n\"At least they happened early\"\n\n\"At least you are young and have plenty of time to make more\"\n\n\"This is just probably cause it's not God's time for you to have kids yet\"\n\n\"At least this gives you more time to focus on yourselves\"\n\n\"Its probably a sign that you should wait for a while\"\n\nWhile all of those hurt so bad, most painful one is the clueless, \"so when are y'all going to have a baby?\" \n\nBecause they don't know that we don't know either.. that we try and my body just won't seem to allow it. That we thought we had and then we didn't have anymore... that we already lost 2 precious babies.. that we don't know when.. we don't know if we'll get to ever see our next baby. No one expects a miscarriage or loss. It just happens. Just cause I never knew their gender or saw their face doesn't make it hurt less.. in fact it hurts more because I will always wonder who they could've been..\n\n just please think before you speak.. because words do hurt.. be aware that it's a common thing but that doesn't make it hurt any less. And when you find out someone has had a loss, Don't try to say something to cheer them up.. because most of the time that will hurt them worse. Just apologize or say nothing. Hug them. Let them know you love them. That you're a shoulder to cry on if they need it. \n\nI hate that women feel like they can't tall about it. Like they have to keep their babies life a secret. I had two babies. And they didn't live for long, but they were loved. And their lives and their stories are worth knowing about. \n\n", "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "ttcafterloss", "subreddit_id": "t5_34scd", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Emergencey ectopic surgery on Monday 3.5 months after 1st mc.. got hit tonight with emotion..", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/ttcafterloss/comments/6ufr23/emergencey_ectopic_surgery_on_monday_35_months/"}, {"author": "couldbewitches", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_text": null, "brand_safe": false, "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1503035381, "domain": "self.ttcafterloss", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/ttcafterloss/comments/6ufx1c/playing_the_period_or_implantation_game/", "id": "6ufx1c", "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "locked": false, "num_comments": 4, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/ttcafterloss/comments/6ufx1c/playing_the_period_or_implantation_game/", "retrieved_on": 1503121604, "score": 4, "selftext": "I've been a lurker here since my miscarriage in March.

I called the nurse's line and she was WONDERFUL and told me to hang tight and call her in the morning so we could see what happened overnight.  I threw my diet out the window for the night and ate Ben &amp; Jerry's for dinner.\n\nTuesday evening I passed some tissue and a few little clots and by Wednesday morning, my bleeding had slowed way down.  I called the nurse and she said it sounded really promising and to NOT take the second dose unless she called me back as she felt I was good.  She never called back so I never took the second dose.  My spotting turned from red to rust to brown over the next two days and I passed little bits that looked just like the tail end of a period.\n\nThis morning, I went in for my follow-up and received GREAT NEWS!  My uterus was empty and there was just one little bit of something working its way out (which was why I was still spotting brown) but they said it will be out soon.  They said my natural uterine lining looks \"fluffy\" but that could either be from me being fresh off a miscarriage or I could just naturally have a fluffy uterus and that either way it's not an issue at all.  They're having me go in next week for one more visit for a baseline reading to see if I'm naturally fluffy or not and they'll do a blood test to check my HCG, too.  Regardless, the doctor said I'm clear and won't need a D&amp;C!!  We just need to wait for one period then we can try again!\n\nI AM SO EXCITED!!!

I will go into my next pregnancy with as much optimism as possible since I know there are no guarantees, but I have as much hope as ever at getting a baby at the end of this.

I hope someone can help me or give me some insight. In April I got the devastating news at my 20 week anatomy scan that my baby had passed. I had a d &amp; e preformed because I figured it would be easier emotionally than giving birth. Since then I've had 3 cycles (on my 3rd currently). Each cycle I've had a really heavy period that lasts about 3 days, stops and then a few days later I get a random gush and then that's it for a few days. Then in the middle of my cycle around when my apps say I should be ovulating I get this weird brown spotting and sometimes a little red too. This is my first month using opks (using clearblue advanced). Today and yesterday I received blinking smileys. I am starting to wonder if I'm experiencing ovulation spotting? I am not temping but I definitely plan to do it next month to make sure I am actually ovulating because I fear I am not. The strange spotting is accompanied by light cramping/slight inflammation feeling in the ovary/pelvic area. My cycles have been about 32-35 days long. I have never really been regular before but I don't recall having mid cycle spotting like this. I have 2 kids already whose pregnancies were perfect. I guess I am paranoid something is wrong or something could be wrong with me. A cause for my loss was never found. I desperately want to be pregnant again to complete my family. As if losing a baby halfway through your pregnancy isn't bad enough.... this guessing game is almost just as bad as I feel like my body isn't working right and working against my wishes.

The journey has just begun.\n\nBrian and I got married June 18, 2016 and have been together since New Years Eve 2010.  We started TTC in November 2016 and found out we were pregnant in December 2016.  I surprised Brian with an early Christmas / Anniversary gift by giving him a Christmas ornament that said Our Baby 2016 and a onesie that said Baby's First Visit From Santa.  We were super surprised and super excited for the days to come.  \n\nA week before our 8 week ultrasound we were supposed to fly to Louisiana where my family lives for Christmas.  The morning we were supposed to leave I started spotting.  The doctor said to take it to easy and that this could just be irritation from cleaning the house.  So we got on the plane and tried to make the most of out of the trip.  I continued to have light spotting leading up to the 8 week ultrasound.  The day before the ultrasound January 2nd to be exact, I miscarried and was confirmed the next day at our appointment.  We were shocked and heartbroken, but were told it was probably a fluke and would probably be pregnant very soon.  February and March came and went without a positive pregnancy test.  We decided to take a break and stop with the ovulation kits and timing intercourse for a couple of months.  \n\nJune was our wedding anniversary month as well as my birthday month and we decided to start trying again except without ovulation kits.  A couple of weeks later we were pregnant again.  This time ecstatic and so thankful.  This time though I started spotting in week 5 but the spotting stopped and my Hcg levels kept rising.  I even felt nauseous and breast tenderness which are the most common pregnancy symptoms!  \n\nOn the day of our 8 week ultrasound we found out the baby had no heartbeat and was measuring 2 weeks behind.  Shocked and heartbroken again...The doctor wanted us to come back in 10 days to see if there was any change but cautioned us this would likely end in miscarriage.  Then the pregnancy symptoms stopped and I knew without having to go back to the doctor that something was wrong.  Surely enough the next appointment confirmed the miscarriage and we were given 3 options.  I could have surgery (D&amp;C), take medication to trigger labor, or wait for it to happen naturally.  We decided to have surgery so we could start to move on.  \n\nWe scheduled an appointment with a fertility doctor who reassured us most people suffering recurrent pregnancy loss will go on to have a healthy baby.  It's just a matter of which journey you want to take.  InVitro Fertilization with Pre-Genetic Screening sounded like the way to because it would lower our chance of miscarriage to 7%!  The nurse advised we would need to wait until my Hcg level was below 5 and for my period to start again before they could start fertility testing.  We are now waiting for period to begin again.\n\nAfter the surgery the doctor sent the fetus out for karyotype testing which looks for chromosomal abnormalities.  As it turned out Trisomy 15 was the cause of the miscarriage.  The Ob-gyn and fertility doctor wants us to see a genetics counselor to advise us of our chances of this happening again or if it was just chance.  We are also waiting for their genetics appointment.\n\nMy follow up appointment after D&amp;C is on Monday August 21, 2017, so stay tuned for a new video in a few days!\n\n\nCourtney", "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "ttcafterloss", "subreddit_id": "t5_34scd", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Thursday would have been our due date | 2nd Miscarriage | August 19, 2017", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/ttcafterloss/comments/6uwd1f/thursday_would_have_been_our_due_date_2nd/"}, {"author": "thosebabyblues", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_text": null, "brand_safe": false, "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1503264997, "domain": "self.ttcafterloss", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/ttcafterloss/comments/6uyhmg/anyone_had_success_with_medication_related_to/", "id": "6uyhmg", "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_css_class": "question", "link_flair_text": "Question", "locked": false, "num_comments": 14, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/ttcafterloss/comments/6uyhmg/anyone_had_success_with_medication_related_to/", "retrieved_on": 1503348761, "score": 4, "selftext": "Hey everyone.\n\nStill on the TTC journey. Before I got pregnant, I was diagnosed with Bipoar II disorder at a fairly young age. I was on medication for 17 years. When we started TTC, I got off of my medications. (At the time, a combination of Lithium and Lamictal, as well as Xanax and Ambien for anxiety and sleep.) Weaning myself off the meds wasn't very difficult even though I had been on that cocktail for about four years. I actually did really really well off of meds and didn't really notice a ton of difference. When I got pregnant I noticed that I tended to get very emotional, but that's pregnancy.\n\nUnfortunately, we lost our daughter at ten weeks. I had to have a D&amp;C. I was doing okay up until the actual procedure. Unfortunately, someone accidentally let in a pro-life \"religious official\" into my room after a nurse spotted funeral forms on my file. The lady came in right before I was wheeled into the procedure and started asking me if I knew what my dead baby was going to look like after the D&amp;C. DH and I were both horrified, and luckily the doctor came in to get me as she was talking. I went through the procedure, and woke up crying hysterically in the recovery room and pleaded with the doctors to hold my baby. They didn't say anything, but gave me a sedative.\n\nIt was a really horrible process that haunted me. I didn't heal quickly and ended up with some complications from retained materials. A week after the D&amp;C, I was at work when I started hemorrhaging in the women's bathroom. I was taken to the hospital where they flushed the rest of the placenta out. I bled for about a month until things started to get back to normal. We started TTC when my doctor said it was okay, which was 3 cycles ago. During the first cycle, I had a disappointing CP probably caused by the thin lining. The cycle after that was anovulatory. Luckily, I did ovulate on the most recent cycle. I was sad to not be pregnant, but at least my body was back to normal. \n\nIt's been almost 4 months since my D&amp;C. It doesn't sound like much, but it feels like forever. I had originally decided to not go back on medication because I wanted to TTC again quickly. But, I'm finding that maybe that wasn't the best choice. While I did well before the MMC off of my meds, it seems that the experience brought my mood down a lot and is still affecting me. For the first three months, I had severe nightmares and could not sleep. My memories were really pervasive and would be triggered throughout the day constantly every time I looked at something baby related. There are some days where I cry for hours at a time, and others where I feel like I can't get out of bed. I'm not really interested in anything anymore other than TTC again. Every month that I get a BFN, it is crushing to me because I get so hopeful during the TWW. It really hurts. There isn't a day that goes by where I don't think about our daughter and what happened. Sometimes I experience anger and sadness towards other people when they talk about their own pregnancies or babies. My heart just takes a dive completely. \n\nI have made several changes in the past few months to help with the depression. I dropped down to part-time work to allow more times to book doctors appointments and to relax. I have been seeing a therapist once a week since the D&amp;C. I have become more diligent in taking proper vitamins and my Synthroid along with Metformin. (although I have gained 20 pounds since I first got pregnant) and I have started to get acupuncture. I even got a dog, which unfortunately was stolen by my mother and ended up causing more harm than good for my emotional health. Sleep has also been an issue. I work nights and tend to fall asleep around 2am and wake around 6am. And then I try to get myself back to sleep around 10am-1pm. Not a great schedule to work with.\n\nDespite changes, I haven't been able to shake most of the depression. All of those little things have helped, but I have not noticed any significant improvement. I'm thinking it may be time to go back on medication again. However, I don't want to go back on Lithium, because I have Hashimoto's disease. I have been told that Lithium can aggravate it. So, I'm looking for alternatives to try. Ideally, I'd like to get on a medication that I will not gain more weight on and that would be fairly easy to stop once I get pregnant. I also will probably go back on Ambien for sleep, because that's been a big problem for me. \n\nLadies who have gone through this before, what experiences do you have with medications for mood stabilizing after loss?\n", "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "ttcafterloss", "subreddit_id": "t5_34scd", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Anyone had success with medication related to depression after MC?", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/ttcafterloss/comments/6uyhmg/anyone_had_success_with_medication_related_to/"}, {"author": "AutoModerator", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_text": null, "brand_safe": false, "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1503299432, "distinguished": "moderator", "domain": "self.ttcafterloss", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/ttcafterloss/comments/6v1bu8/ttcafterloss_ttc_daily_discussion_thread_august/", "id": "6v1bu8", "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_css_class": "ttc", "link_flair_text": "TTC Thread", "locked": false, "num_comments": 51, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/ttcafterloss/comments/6v1bu8/ttcafterloss_ttc_daily_discussion_thread_august/", "retrieved_on": 1503377976, "score": 1, "selftext": "**This thread is for members who are TTC or waiting to try.

I had what was to be a \"baseline\" visit today but my uterus was still \"fluffy\" and upon further inspection, it looked like there was more tissue still retained within it that wasn't super obvious the week prior.

We had sex that Saturday night, unprotected, and they just want to ensure I didn't get pregnant.  The funny thing is on Friday I had NO follicle growth on my ovaries and then today I had a 13mm follicle growing on my right ovary so I really don't think I ovulated on Sunday (we haven't had PIV since anyway).  I was so excited that I was crying at the sight of that beautiful follicle.  I knew we couldn't try until I got a period, but it signaled to me my body was coming back to life.  Then I heard I had to get the D&amp;C and all that happiness was dashed.  So, now I have my D&amp;C for Tuesday, no sex for two weeks post-op, and I should get my period about 4 weeks post-op.  August sure was a dry month for intimacy - looks like September is heading there now, too.\n\nI was anxious about not being able to try in August and now September is completely out, too.  :(  Our one year wedding anniversary is in October and I'm too anxious and scared to even hope we could conceive around that time frame.  Our first conception was at our 4 year anniversary from when we met - I don't know if luck like that could strike twice.  Not that it matters when we conceive, I just WANT to conceive.

We had our first miscarriage at 12 weeks in 2015. It was a missed miscarriage though the baby had passed away just a day before at 11+4. Had to have a D&amp;C. Through testing discovered I have Hashimoto's and PCOS. After this miscarriage, I kind of fell apart. I was beyond distraught and this sub really helped me. \n\nGot pregnant in September 2015 and my amazing daughter was born in June 2016. When she turned a year we started trying again and got pregnant again on the first try. First pregnancy was also first try. From beta #1, I'm been anxious. Progesterone was 17, with my daughter is had been 24. But hcg rose well. Second ultrasound at 7 weeks we were told the sac was small (this is very bad and significantly increases miscarriage risk) but baby kept growing and having a strong heartbeat. At 9 weeks went to the RE for spotting and baby was fine, no sign of bleed. At 10 weeks, went to ER for bleeding. Again baby was fine, discovered a small subchorionic hematoma. No one was concerned. Saw my OB 2 days later and baby looked great, SCH was barely visible. 4 short days after that I start bleeding profusely and cramping so bad I can't walk. Go to ER and we were told the miscarriage is almost complete. I've barely passed any clots before coming in so I guess I did while bleeding in the hospital bed. Waiting to hear if I will need another D&amp;C or if I can continue to naturally. I'd already mapped out my strategy if this happened (I'm type A) which has helped me process. I'll be joining you all in the daily boards again. \n\nEDIT: Ended up having to have a D&amp;C due to my bleeding that wouldn't stop. Was discharged in the early AM and then fainted when I got home.

OB wasn't worried though since it  was still early enough to not see anything.  He took a beta draw that day before I left, then I went back two days later for a second draw.  My hCGs for both draws were ~5100 and ~5200 respectively, and with such a low rise after 48 hours my OB pretty much explained that there is a 99% chance that this pregnancy will end in a miscarriage.  This would be my fifth CP/MC.  OB was very apologetic and told me that I should start bleeding in 2-4 weeks, then gave me instructions for what to do after I stop bleeding as well as if after 4 weeks nothing has happened.\n\nWell, today I am technically 8+0 and aside from my nipples no longer being insanely sensitive to everything and a few brief bouts of what I assumed were cramps, nothing seems to be happening.  I don't care about the fact that I'm going to miscarry so much as wanting the damn miscarriage to get going already.  Is there anything I can do or eat to get encourage it to start?  OB did not want to give me meds or shots, favoring to give my body a chance to miscarry naturally.  I assume these are all things that would be on the table should nothing have happened by what would be 10+3.\n\nSome things I've done thus far:\n\n* Lifted really heavy shit down four flights of stairs (I spent the first 3 weeks of August moving between apartments)\n* Got pinned to a wall by a really heavy and bulky couch pressed up against my abdomen\n* Drank raspberry tea\n* Walked a whole bunch\n\nI haven't drank any alcohol or consumed anything that I know is bad for pregnancies.  Should I?  I'm hesitant to do anything that would adversely affect but not necessarily end a pregnancy in case I fall into that 1% where despite shitty hCG levels the maybe-baby is actually going to survive... even though objectively that is most very likely to not be the case as I have no symptoms that could remotely be attributed to pregnancy.\n\nOr should I just be patient?

I've really appreciated this environment in the past because it's so hard to find people in the general population who understand. I've been quiet for a couple of months -- I'm feeling pretty lost honestly and not really sure what I should be doing at this point.\n\nThe TL;DR is that my RE doesn't think we're infertile and didn't give me a solid timeline for starting interventions -- I'd love to hear when other people's doctors were willing to consider them.\n\nIt took us 9 cycles to conceive our first pregnancy and right before we did, we got SA results with 0% morphology. The OBGYN referred us to an RE. We didn't end up going because we got pregnant, but a few months after we miscarried I made an appointment.\n\nThe RE said we \"don't have infertility\" and he thinks we'll get pregnant again on our own, but he said we could do an HSG to check for scarring from the D&amp;C, and the cycle after that do some monitoring to check out my uterus, follicles, and hormone levels around O time. He seemed to think the morphology might be a slight problem but wasn't too concerned since we did get pregnant.\n\nWe did the HSG last month (clear!) and I didn't get pregnant, so this cycle we're supposed to do the monitoring.\n\nThe RE seemed to think we'd be pregnant very soon, but I find that pretty optimistic given that this is our 6th cycle after the miscarriage and it hasn't happened yet. He said something about how we could start looking at meds/insemination after the monitored cycle but wasn't clear about a timeline because the primary message was \"chill out, you'll get pregnant soon.\" I'm mostly worried the previous pregnancy was one in a million and our chances are low for it to happen again on its own, and I'm so sick of struggling.\n\nI thought a MMC wouldn't count against the \"12 months\" definition of infertility, especially with 0% morphology, but it turns out it does (at least as far as my RE is concerned).\n\nIf you've gotten there, at what point was your doctor willing to talk interventions like IUI/IVF with you? Any words of wisdom for a reasonable timeline? Of course I'd love a free sex baby but I'm not sure it's a realistic dream, and I'm having a pretty hard time waiting for it. :\\", "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "ttcafterloss", "subreddit_id": "t5_34scd", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "When is/was your doctor willing to consider interventions (IUI/IVF) after your loss?", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/ttcafterloss/comments/6wdxu5/when_iswas_your_doctor_willing_to_consider/"}, {"author": "[deleted]", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_text": null, "brand_safe": false, "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1503892734, "domain": "self.ttcafterloss", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/ttcafterloss/comments/6wh0he/2nd_cycle_after_early_miscarriage_random_brain/", "id": "6wh0he", "is_crosspostable": false, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "locked": false, "num_comments": 0, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/ttcafterloss/comments/6wh0he/2nd_cycle_after_early_miscarriage_random_brain/", "retrieved_on": 1503975752, "score": 4, "selftext": "[deleted]", "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "ttcafterloss", "subreddit_id": "t5_34scd", "thumbnail": "default", "title": "2nd cycle after early miscarriage - random brain dump", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/ttcafterloss/comments/6wh0he/2nd_cycle_after_early_miscarriage_random_brain/"}, {"author": "AutoModerator", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_text": null, "brand_safe": false, "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1503904248, "distinguished": "moderator", "domain": "self.ttcafterloss", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/ttcafterloss/comments/6whtzn/ttcafterloss_ttc_daily_discussion_thread_august/", "id": "6whtzn", "is_crosspostable": false, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_css_class": "ttc", "link_flair_text": "TTC Thread", "locked": false, "num_comments": 34, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/ttcafterloss/comments/6whtzn/ttcafterloss_ttc_daily_discussion_thread_august/", "retrieved_on": 1503986306, "score": 2, "selftext": "**This thread is for members who are TTC or waiting to try.

At the anatomy scan at 20 weeks he was diagnosed with a complex heart disease, Tetralogy of Fallot. We spent two scary weeks waiting for a chromosome test, because this heart disease is associated with a certain chromosomal complex. The test came back negatively and we decided wholeheartedly to proceed with the pregnancy. Tetralogy of Fallot in itself can be mostly fixed with surgery and after that our son could expect a mostly normal life. We did everything we could to prepare ourselves for the time to come. We knew he would spend his first weeks in the NICU, because he would probably need a medicine to regulate his blood flow.\nA couple of days before our due date our gyn decided it was best to induce, so we had to stay in the hospital. But at the time there was no room in the NICU, so we had to wait 3 days before the actual induction could start. Labor actually went rather well according to my wife, and our little boy Hidde was born. His start was rather good, with Apgars of 8 and 9, so there was time for him to be with his mother for a couple of minutes and for me to cut the umbilical cord. After that he was brought to the NICU, given an ultrasound and hooked up to all the machines.\nFollowing this were 11 roller-coaster days. We could visit him 24/7, but it costs a lot of energy to be at the NICU. But after a few days we settled into a sort of rhythm which seemed to work for the three of us. We could wash him, change his diapers, we tried some breastfeeding, but this was rather tiring for him.\nThe cardiologists decided he needed surgery as a temporary solution. For the more permanent surgery to correct all the defects he would need to be older, about half a year, but to be able to make it to that age he would need a shunt between his aorta and his pulmonary artery.\nWe were visiting him the day before that, a day with a lot of talks about the surgery scheduled. He was lying on my wife's breast, and apparently the line for his medicine was blocking up. Not a big problem, this happened before, a lot depended on how he held his arm. So we put him back in his bed, and the nurses tried to make sure the line stayed free. One of the side effects of his medicine was that it made him a bit more sensitive. He was mostly used to us touching him, but he didn't like it to much when he was handled to much. After a while he started crying, which wasn't that unusual, but rather than stopping after a few cries he went on, it became worse, and suddenly he started turning blue...\nThe doctors were rushed in, and for 45 minutes they tried to reanimate him. We were present for the first part, scared out of our minds, people rushing by, no-one who really took note of us. We left, not knowing what to do. One of the nurses found us, and after some time one of the doctors came, telling us it was best if we were present now, to see for ourselves they did everything they could. And they did, when we left there were 2 doctors, by now at least 9 people were standing around him, giving chest compressions, trying to figure out what was wrong with our little boy. But whatever they tried, it didn't work. And so came the world shattering moment when they brought him to us and laid him on my wives lap...\nWe spend the next couple of hours just holding him, washing him, clothing him for the first time, making little footprints. We buried him yesterday, and are trying to figure out what to do now. We already said to each other we would certainly like for him to have a brother or sister at some point. We still have to wait for a full genetic test to be sure about this, and of course try to make some kind of peace with what happened to us.", "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "ttcafterloss", "subreddit_id": "t5_34scd", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "[Introduction] Lost my son after 11 days", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/ttcafterloss/comments/6whwuh/introduction_lost_my_son_after_11_days/"}, {"author": "Metsgal", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_text": null, "brand_safe": false, "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1503933407, "domain": "self.ttcafterloss", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/ttcafterloss/comments/6wk0ss/flashbacks/", "id": "6wk0ss", "is_crosspostable": false, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "locked": false, "num_comments": 8, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/ttcafterloss/comments/6wk0ss/flashbacks/", "retrieved_on": 1504016472, "score": 1, "selftext": "So it's been 2 months since my TFMR at 17 weeks.

July we kind of did a \"Hail Mary\" attempt just to see if we would get lucky (we didn't). This month I paid attention to both my regular period tracker app and my Ovia app. Had sex when I was in my fertile period (according to the apps) and am now in the home stretch of the TWW. Ovia says I have 4 more days until I *should* take a pregnancy test.\n\nWe realized we may have conceived during a very difficult time period in regards to my husband's past - an ex girlfriend's (who tragically passed in an accident) birthday was a day we had sex during the peak of my fertile window. We may find out we are pregnant in and around what would have been our 20-ish week for the baby we lost. We plan to announce around Christmas which was roughly our due date with our angel baby.\n\nI want this so bad, but at the same time I can't shake the fear. All the questions in my head swirling. What if we aren't pregnant? Do we just keep going in the \"natural\" way of TTC? Do we invest in OPK's or other forms of more in depth fertility tracking? What if we are pregnant? All the milestones with this theoretical pregnancy line up almost perfectly with other milestones for the pregnancy we lost. Plus all the questions I have about pregnancy itself - I had a super rough, high risk, complicated, traumatic pregnancy with my (almost) 2 year old son. Will we have a Unicorn going on or am I in for another shit-show of horrible.\n\nI want to pee on all the things but want to wait until I know it's the right time to test so I don't get a negative result simply because it's too soon to get accurate results.

After our initial consultation the genetic counselor suggested that husband and I can consider chromosome analysis and carrier screening.  Chromosome analysis may not be covered by insurance (though the counselor said they could make an argument for us after 4 CP/MCs) and it would typically take a week to get the results back.  Meanwhile carrier screening is commonly ordered by OBs anyway, and it would typically take a month to get the results back.\n\nAt the time I was about 5 weeks into my fifth pregnancy so husband and I decided to hold off on both tests and re-evaluate if we have another miscarriage.  Long story short, we're having a fifth miscarriage.  Already spoke with my OB who will refer me to an RE after this miscarriage is complete.  I expect that I won't get to see my OB until 9/19 the earliest.  When I asked my husband if he'd like to move forward with the two tests suggested by the genetic counselor, he preferred to wait until after our first RE appointment to see what tests they order.\n\nI'd be fine with waiting on the chromosome analysis since it only takes a week for results to come back, but the month's wait for carrier screening has me feeling impatient.  Since we're waiting for the miscarriage to end anyway, I feel like we could make use of the time to get that test done and out of the way. I know we would still need to wait if fetal testing is required, but at least the first half of the screening is already done.  While we would of course prefer not to spent a crazy amount of money on \"elective\" testing, money in itself is (fortunately) not a factor.\n\nWhat are your thoughts?  If I'm just being impatient, please do let me know!\n\n**Update 8/31:** Called OB's office to scheduled the follow up appointment to check that the miscarriage completed.  It won't be until 9/19, which gives my uterus plenty of time to get rid of everything, but hopefully not enough time for an infection to form should it not.  Also got the RE's office number.  It's not a single RE, but a group of them who work in the reproductive medicine department.   Called the reproductive medicine dept, gave the receptionist an overview of the situation, and asked if I should go ahead and do the tests.  Unfortunately she couldn't give me a straight answer on whether to proceed with the tests unless I'm registered as one of the RE's patients.   I assume this is for legal/liability/HIPAA reasons, so I didn't press.  She did offered to register me as a patient with an RE of my choice, but I didn't know if my OB would refer me to a specific one and didn't want to inadvertently step on his toes, so I said I'd wait until after seeing him.\n\nI then sent an email to the genetic counselor and asked if she'd suggest I proceed with the tests she recommended, or if I should wait until after talking to OB/RE.  I'm assuming that she'll say something similar to what she told me at my last appointment, that it's up to me whether to do the testing through her office or the OB/RE's... in which case I'm just going to move forward with the testing.  Looking back, I probably should have just gone for both tests after our initial consultation.  The tests are non-invasive so other than chromosome analysis potentially costing a few thousand because there wasn't enough evidence to make a case for insurance to cover it, there was no real risk or downsides for us.", "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "ttcafterloss", "subreddit_id": "t5_34scd", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "While waiting for the RE referral, should I move forward with tests suggested by genetic counselor?", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/ttcafterloss/comments/6x2cq7/while_waiting_for_the_re_referral_should_i_move/"}, {"author": "AutoModerator", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_text": null, "brand_safe": false, "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1504163281, "distinguished": "moderator", "domain": "self.ttcafterloss", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/ttcafterloss/comments/6x5cs6/ttcafterloss_ttc_daily_discussion_thread_august/", "id": "6x5cs6", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_css_class": "ttc", "link_flair_text": "TTC Thread", "locked": false, "num_comments": 50, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/ttcafterloss/comments/6x5cs6/ttcafterloss_ttc_daily_discussion_thread_august/", "retrieved_on": 1504248216, "score": 2, "selftext": "**This thread is for members who are TTC or waiting to try.

I had two ultrasounds the first showing a flicker, but unable to count HR and the second showing a hr of 118. I was so thrilled, but soon lost all my pregnancy symptoms which weren't terribly strong to begin with. Well a week and a half after seeing the heartbeat I had my new ob appt where there was no heartbeat anymore. He insisted on checking with the ultrasound tech with her machine and same story. I just felt so numb and couldn't even cry. I made the decision to have a d and c and was scheduled on aug 8. Things have been smooth sailing since then.

Yeah, didn't help.\n\nSo now I'm not sure where to go from here. I want to get more serious about trying, figure out if there are any issues, and make sure future pregnancies have the best chance possible.\n\nShould I see a fertility specialist now? Should I try temping/charting first to see if I can get pregnant again faster? 3 small uterine fibroids (two were 3 mm and one was 1 cm) were discovered during my first ultrasound as well, although the midwife did not give any information on whether those should be removed or not in the future (so helpful). Anyone have any experience with those? \n\nI'm surprised by how I received no guidance after my miscarriage.

I was here for a bit earlier this year when I had a MMC around 6 weeks. Waited to pass it naturally but ended up taking misoprostol around 9 weeks. That pregnancy was a result of our first IUI, we had tried for eleven cycles prior to that. \n\nAfter the miscarriage we tried just timed sex for four cycles, and then did two unsuccessful IUIs. We were taking a break from treatment to decide what to do next when we got pregnant again in July from just sex. A huge happy shock! And even better, I was pregnant during the due date from my last pregnancy. Which just felt, right? I don't know. \n\nObviously we were very cautious after our first loss and tried not to get excited until after the ultrasound. At the 7 week ultrasound, I had convinced myself the pregnancy wasn't viable. I had few symptoms, and just didn't feel pregnant. So I was mentally and emotionally prepared for bad news. To my surprise, the baby was there, measuring right on track, with a perfect heartbeat that we got to hear. It was truly one of the most incredible experiences of my life to hear that little heartbeat. I could not believe it. We scheduled a follow up u/s for one week later before my RE would release us to an OB. \n\nWell, all the stats say that your risk of of miscarriage is drastically reduced after you see a heartbeat. And so, I let myself get excited. I started planning when we would announce, looking into a midwife practice, making notes on my calendar about when I needed to do things. I was really confident. \n\nUnfortunately at our follow up ultrasound on Monday, there was no heartbeat. I decided to have a D&amp;C so that we could send off the embryo for testing, because I'd really like to know if something was wrong. We are obviously devastated. I'm asking a lot of questions. Why? What was the purpose of getting to hear the heartbeat when it was just going to die? Why couldn't we have gotten the bad news two weeks ago when I was prepared? How is it possible that we are in the very small percentage of couples who miscarry more than once? What is wrong with us? Our doctor is going to start us on RPL testing now, which I hope will give us some answers. \n\nWhile I'm mourning the loss of this baby, I'm also just so defeated. Trying to get pregnant has been the most miserable (almost) two years of my life. I'm exhausted at the idea of trying again. How long will it take this time? And if we succeed again, I have to try to make it through another first trimester. How many losses will I have to endure? How do people do this? \n\nAnyway, the D&amp;C was yesterday and it went well. Although I'm not really cramping or bleeding much, so I don't know if that is normal? I'm also feeling pretty numb about it. Besides yesterday, I haven't really cried. Like, I know that I'm heartbroken, but my brain won't even let me go there. Must be survival mode. \n\nThanks for letting me tell my story and get this out. &lt;3 ", "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "ttcafterloss", "subreddit_id": "t5_34scd", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Second miscarriage", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/ttcafterloss/comments/6xe4fl/second_miscarriage/"}, {"author": "Pretendtotile", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_text": null, "brand_safe": false, "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1504269437, "domain": "self.ttcafterloss", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/ttcafterloss/comments/6xe8jr/a_sad_intro_missed_miscarriage/", "id": "6xe8jr", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_css_class": "intro", "link_flair_text": "Intro", "locked": false, "num_comments": 13, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/ttcafterloss/comments/6xe8jr/a_sad_intro_missed_miscarriage/", "retrieved_on": 1504356769, "score": 4, "selftext": "I'm heartbroken to be posting here.

I was 9 weeks and went in for a routine ultrasound and we found out that it was a twins, and b that they had stopped growing at 6.5 weeks. I elected to have a d&amp;c, as I did not want to wait to naturally miscarry, and had it July 20th.  Everything went well I was feeling pretty well until the following Tuesday, so 5 days post op. I started having cramping and heavier bleeding. The next day I worked, and I was feeling pretty crappy, bad cramps. I work in the ER (3p-3a) so I came home from work that morning and when I woke up around 1:45 passed a grapefruit sized clot.  It was concerning but I thought ok I'll go to work and call the ob's office.  I got to work and began passing more baseball sized clots and my co-worker made me check in to be seen. They diagnosed me with retained products of conception, offered to admit me, I declined, and they gave me a dose of methergin.  I went home passed one more very large clot and then it stopped.  They checked my hcg at that time and it was 611.  That was the only one I had done during this whole thing.\nI believe I ovulated around August 12/13th, as I had positive OPKs and other fertile signs.  I was stupid and took a test 10dpo and got a faint positive.  I believe it was residual from the miscarriage, but perhaps it could have been a chemical too.  I took one 10, 11, and 12 dpo and had faint lines.  I got my period at 14 dpo.  We will be trying again this month, as I was told I did not have to wait. I've been having long cycles and the cycle before and during which I conceived I took soy isoflavones and they helped shorten my cycle and move my ovulation from day 28 to day 18.  We have a 2 year old daughter and it took three months to get pregnant with her, and it took five months for this last one.  \nI think I am doing relatively ok, it just hard to move on from the I should be x number of weeks pregnant this week.

In March my husband and I lost our daughter at 34 weeks and delivered via emergency c-section. There were some complications during pregnancy with intermittent bleeding, growth and the cord insertion site so I spent the third trimester worried but still full of excitement to meet her as we had a confident medical team and additional scans. Nothing could have prepared us for the shocking complications at the very end which at this point I am not ready to discuss in any more detail. \n\n\nWe had just had our baby shower two weeks before, still had the banner with her name over the fireplace, a completed nursery, all the clothes folded and sorted by size. When we came home from the hospital it was all there but we didn't have her. I feel like at that moment my life was divided into two sections. Before and after the loss. She was our first child so we came home to our two dogs and otherwise silence. \n\n\nThe first few weeks we had family visiting and cooking for us. I was on painkillers and anti-anxiety medicine and was grieving very hard but otherwise very out of it and I hardly remember that first month. I had already left my job in my third trimester to rest and prepare for her arrival and was planning on getting a new job when she was 6 months old. I didn't have to leave the house for awhile so I posted up on the couch with my dogs, took my pills and tried to eat when I could. My husband went back to work after a few weeks and I began three months of healing physically after the surgery and having therapy multiple times a week before looking for work again. My doctor let me know that due to the surgery we would have to wait 6 months to try again, which has been incredibly hard as I have the strongest feeling of needing to be pregnant again and due to my age I am in a panic that pregnancies could become harder to achieve or be more complicated. \n\n\nI started my new job 6 weeks ago. My husband and I spent 8 days on vacation in Australia, a trip planned in May. I thought the new job and the vacation would help with the grief but since returning from our trip I have spent the last week in the deepest depression since March. I have so many triggers. Seeing photos of or hearing about babies of the women that were pregnant at the same time as me is the hardest. One sister in law has 4 girls ranging from 1 - 5 years old. Two other sisters in law are recently trying and it seems like every other woman at work is either pregnant or coming back from maternity leave with baby stories. I can hardly get in an elevator without being around expecting women. I cry about it almost daily because seeing them is like seeing a mirror reflecting the inverse of my life, the opposite outcome of my horrible loneliness and pain without my daughter\n\n\nAnother thing I am struggling with is the lack of support I have received from friends and family. After the first few weeks of our loss people stopped asking how we were or asking about our loss. My friends grow silent and change the subject if I bring it up, even though I only do extremely carefully and thoughtfully. People openly talk about their babies or other babies loudly and with with glee, in detail like how they are eating their first solid foods or taking their first steps. People brag about healthy pregnancies, using the word healthy, when they know exactly what I went through. Nobody has stopped to ask if what they are talking about might be hurtful. It seems like people have forgotten or don't care and it makes me so sad that I feel like throwing up when it happens because the grief is so overwhelming. I am kind and supportive and rarely bring up what happened but i wish people would be more thoughtful. \n\n\nI am open to advice on how to deal with triggers and the feeling that I am unsupported by the people in my life. I have appreciated reading this sub occasionally when I can bring myself to. It's hard because my husband and I are not even talking about TTC until the end of this month, and it could be months or longer until we are actually able to try. There are a lot of painful variables. \n\n\nThank you for listening. \n\n\n\n", "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "ttcafterloss", "subreddit_id": "t5_34scd", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "First Post.
