I am the husband of a beautiful 28 year old woman and we\u2019ve now experienced two miscarriages, back to back. First was a chemical pregnancy and the second was diagnosed as a blighted ovum. \n\nIt took us 12-months to conceive and decided to see a RE. Of course as soon as we made the appointment we were pregnant. After that loss we rescheduled our initial consult and then boom, pregnant again. Our doctor explained all of the testing that they would do for traditional infertility testing - one of which is an HSG (I believe that\u2019s the acronym... it\u2019s the test to see if one or both of her tubes is blocked). I really hope this isn\u2019t a dumb question but how could her tubes be blocked if we\u2019ve now successfully conceived, even if they\u2019ve both ended in loss. Neither was ectopic so I can\u2019t physically understand it? Sperm travels to the egg, fertilizes the egg, and the fertilized egg travels to the uterus (with the exception of ectopic), right? So if neither pregnancy took, wouldn\u2019t the fertilized egg be what my wife is passing? Does what I\u2019m typing make sense? Again, this is coming from a man who is just truly confused and trying to understand.\n\nTo be fair, we haven\u2019t had the HSG test yet but it\u2019s one of those tests we\u2019re both worried about and I can\u2019t tell if there is a reason to be worried or not?

I've waited for this news for a long time, and basically worked out I'd get two possible answers; 1) that its just the very small fibroid I know I have in there, TTC at your leisure or 2) its a polyp, time to schedule polypectomy (which I had done enough reading about to know it was relatively easy, and would improve my chances of carrying, and I was on board with this.) I guess I knew there'd be an option for a 3) but I didn't factor it in. \n\nTurns out, no polyp - just the small, symptom-less fibroid I knew I had, that didn't interfere with conceiving, and that I have been promised over and over didn't cause the MC. Saline ultrasound reveal it is in the uterine cavity, not in the walls, but that was the extent of the revelation. However, the doctor still wants to discuss me getting surgery to remove it.\n\nI'm confused, because as far as I can tell, there's no need to do this - unless I have trouble conceiving or it causes me pain, right? (We conceived on the third cycle, unless we got extra lucky I'm not sure that's a problem). Also not that a polypectomy is minor, but a myomectomy seems like way more of \"a thing\" with more potential complications and longer recovery. \n\nAnyway, I guess I'm asking for...myomectomy experiences, fibroid experiences, or anything like that you all might have to share. I'm going to be pushing my doc to really make the case for surgery to me in a few weeks, because I certainly don't want to do it if it's unnecessary. (Might also be that I got a really brief CYA answer in the limited time between ending the ultrasound and the doc moving to the next appt, so I'm wondering how set she is on it.)", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "ttcafterloss", "subreddit_id": "t5_34scd", "subreddit_subscribers": 7622, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Questions about fibroid removal?", "total_awards_received": 0, "treatment_tags": [], "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/ttcafterloss/comments/hga9nw/questions_about_fibroid_removal/"}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "FMLtoOTF", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_2i3gu1x7", "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_premium": false, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1593188002, "domain": "self.ttcafterloss", "edited": 1593192009, "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/ttcafterloss/comments/hgaihu/grief_vs_depression_after_miscarriage/", "gildings": {}, "id": "hgaihu", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_css_class": "support", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_template_id": "0b925822-beed-11e4-97e6-22000b3c81cc", "link_flair_text": "Support", "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": false, "num_comments": 14, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/ttcafterloss/comments/hgaihu/grief_vs_depression_after_miscarriage/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1593192547, "score": 6, "selftext": "Many women have stated that miscarrying is something you don\u2019t ever get over; it\u2019s just something you learn to live with.

We started the investigations in Aug and found out the issue was on my side as I had a grade 3 varicocele which had given me a very low count and morphology. (6 Million/ml and 2% morph). Which was devastating, especially since we didn\u2019t know whether fixing it would help us. \n\nFor those who aren\u2019t familiar with what a varicocele is, it\u2019s enlarged veins within the scrotum which is theorised to generate heat and kills off/damages sperm. The idea is to block those veins off to treat it.\nIn the meantime while waiting to get referred for this operation I changed my diet and began eating healthier and taking vitamins which helped things somewhat but my count was still low to borderline after 2 more tests were done. (11-30 million)\n\nThen I had my varicocele embolisation to treat it in Nov and the worst part is that the wait time to see if it has worked is about (3-4) months, maybe longer as that\u2019s how long it takes for new sperm to be created. We kept trying in the meantime but had no luck still. I got impatient and went in for another test at less than 3 months in Feb and got my results back at 161 million/ml, 100% morphology and great progressive movement. I actually cried with happiness that maybe everything was going to be ok. Not only had it improved my count but it was now more than twice that of the average count.\n\nNo later than 2 weeks after this test we found out my wife was pregnant and we were over the moon! We went in for various scans at 8, 12 and 13 weeks and the baby was healthy and developing right on time and had a strong heartbeat.\n\nThe only issue we ever had was that at 14 weeks one morning my wife got some very very light spotting which quickly went away. Another scan that day confirmed everything was fine. We had been moving things upstairs in our house, so put it down to my wife overdoing it/straining.\n\nWe then went for our 20 week scan this Monday, very excited to find out the baby\u2019s gender only to have the most devastating news that there was no heartbeat and the baby had passed on at 15 weeks. It was absolutely heartbreaking and devastating to us and we are still in a great deal of pain. The worst part is that we swore we had been feeling little kicks and movement throughout and had no warning signs at all.\n\nWe have been truly been heartbroken, also having to endure the actual delivery of the baby up at our local hospital earlier in the week. However, we are so glad to have put this behind us though and we now feel that we can close this chapter on our life and begin to move on slowly each day.\n\nAfter speaking with our fertility specialist she checked the baby for us sadly confirming that it had been a baby boy and said that it had been developing well with no obvious genetic issues. It tears me up inside that I know I\u2019ll never get to meet and hold him.\nOur specialist thinks the issue may have been due to the placenta as during the delivery they had a great deal of trouble getting it to detach properly. We will find out more information in time though.\n\nWe have both been talking about everything lots this week and decided that we both want to start trying again as soon as possible and try not to let this loss define us as a couple. We are glad that the underlying issue we had before has been fixed so hopefully next time we will be able to conceive quickly. I\u2019ve already started taking vitamins again and eating healthy as possible. I just want to do anything I can where I feel\nI can help.\n\nFor now we are going to take some time to mourn and be together. I\u2019ll post again a little nearer the time and let you all know how we get on.", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "ttcafterloss", "subreddit_id": "t5_34scd", "subreddit_subscribers": 7632, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Our journey so far (long!)", "total_awards_received": 0, "treatment_tags": [], "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/ttcafterloss/comments/hgqkqo/our_journey_so_far_long/"}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "mommyofanangel", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_6nt9a2uk", "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_premium": false, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1593272805, "domain": "self.ttcafterloss", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/ttcafterloss/comments/hgvtdn/how_often_do_you_take_ovulation_tests/", "gildings": {}, "id": "hgvtdn", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 11, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/ttcafterloss/comments/hgvtdn/how_often_do_you_take_ovulation_tests/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1593276203, "score": 1, "selftext": "Hi, how often do you all take ovulation tests?

I\u2019m perfectly healthy, all normal numbers, insides etc. Same with DH sperm count motility etc. At month 12 we did our first IUI and it worked! However we soon found out based on my betas and a failed d&amp;c that it was ectopic, and I had the two methotrexate shots.\n\nThen came the 3 month wait for the methotrexate poison to leave the body, which happened to correspond with covid quarantine. Finally our clinic reopened just as I was ending the wait. We did another IUI right away, but due to covid they didn\u2019t do a baseline ultrasound and I just started on clomid, and had an ultrasound before the trigger shot. Unfortunately no luck.\n\nWhen I went in for my baseline at my next cycle, they discovered 3 cysts, 2 small on my right ovary and a larger on my left. Doctor said it could be left over from the follicles from clomid last cycle and recommended a rest cycle from clomid. My estrogen levels were also high from the cysts. Still tried naturally. During the 2WW was my 33rd birthday, which was sad because it marks yet another year without a child.  \n\nThe NEXT DAY my little sister told me she.  was 9 weeks pregnant. I\u2019m happy for her but obviously devastated. She knows about my ectopic And fertility issues so was very sensitive in telling me , which I appreciate, but it still hurts. \n\nI went in for my next baseline after waiting a cycle yesterday. The smaller cysts disappeared but the larger was still there, and my estrogen was still high. They have no put me on birth control for the next 3 weeks (maybe longer, TBD). I have an ultrasound scheduled 3 weeks from now to see if the bc helped the cyst go away, and if so we will start another clomid cycle and try another IUI.\n\nThis will be my 3rd IUI which is the limit my doctor recommends. I\u2019m so sad and frustrated. I don\u2019t know why this isn\u2019t working. I\u2019ve never drank a soda or coffee in my whole life, so no caffeine. I\u2019ve never smoked a cigarette ever. I eat healthy, work out 4-5 days a week, healthy BMI. DH has other kids from a previous marriage so I know he doesn\u2019t have issues. I\u2019m so sad and frustrated and every new pregnancy announcement I see or pregnant belly gets harder.\n\nI have NO IDEA how I\u2019m going to make it through my sister\u2019s pregnancy. Watching her get more and more pregnant every week...I\u2019m going to lose it. She\u2019s due January 11th and I just don\u2019t think I can sit through Christmas with the family if I\u2019m not pregnant. DH is from England ( we are in the USA) so I already warned my mom I may have to be elsewhere for the holidays for my mental health. \n\nJust venting.

My gut says clexane isn't treating the issue which I suspect is autoimmune, and I really can't just keep having miscarriages while they try and figure out what works.\n\nI don't really know what I'm looking for in this post I'm just so depressed and anxious and feel so isolated by this process \ud83d\ude29", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "ttcafterloss", "subreddit_id": "t5_34scd", "subreddit_subscribers": 7638, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Feel too scared to try again", "total_awards_received": 0, "treatment_tags": [], "upvote_ratio": 0.88, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/ttcafterloss/comments/hh51sq/feel_too_scared_to_try_again/"}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "[deleted]", "author_flair_background_color": "", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_text_color": "dark", "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1593306166, "domain": "self.ttcafterloss", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/ttcafterloss/comments/hh5gpe/em_feelings_cycle_12_1_em/", "gildings": {}, "id": "hh5gpe", "is_crosspostable": false, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": false, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_css_class": "vent", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_template_id": "e465bc62-beec-11e4-a607-22000b6b9cb2", "link_flair_text": "Vent", "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 0, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/ttcafterloss/comments/hh5gpe/em_feelings_cycle_12_1_em/", "pinned": false, "removed_by_category": "deleted", "retrieved_on": 1593318811, "score": 1, "selftext": "[deleted]", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "ttcafterloss", "subreddit_id": "t5_34scd", "subreddit_subscribers": 7638, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "default", "title": "EM feelings cycle 12// 1 EM", "total_awards_received": 0, "treatment_tags": [], "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/ttcafterloss/comments/hh5gpe/em_feelings_cycle_12_1_em/"}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "_redacted666", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_5mgug8l3", "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_premium": false, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1593306310, "domain": "self.ttcafterloss", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/ttcafterloss/comments/hh5hwe/em_feelings_long_vent_cycle_111_em/", "gildings": {}, "id": "hh5hwe", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_css_class": "vent", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_template_id": "e465bc62-beec-11e4-a607-22000b6b9cb2", "link_flair_text": "Vent", "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 7, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/ttcafterloss/comments/hh5hwe/em_feelings_long_vent_cycle_111_em/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1593318872, "score": 3, "selftext": "I took a FRER on June 11th (my period was two days late) with my second urine of the day and had a faint line, not a complete squinter, but definitely not a dark line. I was at work and took the test to one of my coworkers, who is about 12 weeks pregnant with her second child. She confirmed she saw the line, but said \u201cit\u2019s really light you should take a digital cause those are more accurate\u201d. \nAs far as I know, and correct me if I\u2019m wrong, but any line is a positive. I took 3 more tests, at different times, including a digital. I kept getting faint lines, but they were always there. Except the digital said no, so I broke that open and saw a faint line. I just thought I ovulated late and it was early still. \nOn June 12th I called my PCP and asked for a beta, but he said he just needed a qualitative test to get an OB referral. The qualitative test only shows a positive over 25 HCG. I went with my mom to her mammogram and got the results on my phone, and it was negative. I tried to explain qualitative HCG to my mom, and she just told me \u201cnot to do that, you can try again\u201d it felt like a slap to the face. \nMy PCP called me later that day and said he would order another test the following week if I didn\u2019t start my period. I asked about the possibility of a chemical pregnancy and he said that he doesn\u2019t like that term, and if I got my period it was probably a false positive. Over the weekend I was obsessing and taking test after test, different brands. Each time there was a faint line, again I told myself it was just early. I was exhausted, taking naps every day. I was dry heaving into the toilet every morning, and everyday at three pm like clockwork. My husband was rubbing my belly at night, we were excited but I was trying to be realistic, I felt like I knew i was going to lose it. \nOn the 16th around 2 am I woke up with abdominal cramps and was spotting. I cried but tried to tell myself it could be normal, and tried to sleep. I went into work, and the bleeding stopped for a few hours, but I was too scared to take another pregnancy test. I kept running to the bathroom to check for blood, and around 11 I started bleeding bright red. I knew it was over. I cried in my charge nurses office for about 15 minutes, and then tried to carry on, but by 1300 I told her I had to leave. I couldn\u2019t stop crying I felt like I was dying. I know it was early but I knew in my heart and mind I was pregnant. And then I wasn\u2019t. \nI took the following day off work ( my husband and I just laid in bed all day, and he was really supportive, even when he was hurting too) and came back on the 18th.  A couple of my coworkers were being distant but I just wanted to be alone, so I didn\u2019t think much of it. On Father\u2019s Day my husband and I went to my parents house (I hadn\u2019t spoken to my mom since she made that comment) she could tell I was upset with her, but I couldn\u2019t bring myself to talk to her about what was going on. \nMy husband, my dad and I were talking in the basement about cars or something I just came out and told my dad what happened, and how my mom had made me feel, and he was sad, but just told me my mom doesn\u2019t have the best \u201ctact\u201d sometimes. \nOn the 22nd at 11pm I went to the ER for 8/10 abdominal pain. (I have chronic abdominal pain and sometimes my meds don\u2019t work) in the ER I asked for a pelvic ultrasound and explained what had happened, and I was concerned that I had an ectopic pregnancy. Instead they gave me morphine and sent me home. \nI took the next day off as I was groggy from the meds and hadn\u2019t gotten home until 3 am. My charge nurse has been very understanding the last couple weeks and had no issue with it. When I came back the next day my coworkers continued with the distance, and I was starting to feel like myself again, so it hurt my feelings a little. But I just figured they were closer with each other than with me, and i was being sensitive. \nAnyway yesterday they came up to me at the end of the day and asked if I thought they were acting \u201cdifferent\u201d and I told them I had noticed it a little but just figured I was being sensitive. The pregnant one said they were trying to give me space, because they didn\u2019t know what was wrong with me. So I told them a little about what had happened and the whole time the pregnant one is rubbing her belly and asking if I had got it confirmed by my doctor. So I lied to her, and said yes just because I didn\u2019t feel like explaining myself to her. She just looked like she was judging me the whole time, and I just wanted the conversation to end. She kept implying that she didn\u2019t believe me. I don\u2019t know why she felt the need to minimize my feelings, it doesn\u2019t affect her in any way, so why does she feel the need to judge the validity of my experience? It just really bothered me. \nThere\u2019s so many little things that I forgot to include, (like how I had all my positive tests sitting in a full trashcan in my bathroom for days after, but I couldn\u2019t throw them away completely) but it\u2019s already long, and I\u2019m sorry if you stuck around to read it, it\u2019s not that interesting but it helped to get it out in its entirety. \nI cry everyday, even just for a minute, but it gets just a little easier each time. I\u2019m terrified to ever see another positive test again, because I won\u2019t trust it until my child is sitting in front of me. It was my first every positive and now I\u2019m seeing all these pregnancy announcements on social media, my husbands sister had her gender reveal yesterday and it\u2019s a girl. My husband was convinced our baby was a girl. A few years ago I was talking with his sister about names and mentioned I love the name Noelle, and she said she did too, and whoever had a girl first could use the name. She has three boys, and was trying for a while this time around. \n\nAgain I\u2019m starting to ramble, so here\u2019s a TLDR:\nI had an early loss and a pregnant coworker and my mom are making me feel crazy and minimizing my experience.", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "ttcafterloss", "subreddit_id": "t5_34scd", "subreddit_subscribers": 7638, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "EM feelings (long vent) //cycle 11//1 EM", "total_awards_received": 0, "treatment_tags": [], "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/ttcafterloss/comments/hh5hwe/em_feelings_long_vent_cycle_111_em/"}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "seajess1", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_3twfjpjp", "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_premium": false, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1593312004, "domain": "self.ttcafterloss", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/ttcafterloss/comments/hh6tu7/anyone_been_able_to_help_fibroids_stopping_things/", "gildings": {}, "id": "hh6tu7", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 0, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/ttcafterloss/comments/hh6tu7/anyone_been_able_to_help_fibroids_stopping_things/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1593321066, "score": 2, "selftext": "So a little back story.

Unfortunately my fibroids and scar tissue have pushed my ovaries so far out of the way that they couldn't get to them to get any eggs.  And I have a blocked tube.   I am now 40.  I feel like I have everything against me but I desperately want to give my husband a baby.  Has anyone had any success with fibroids or scar tissue and still been able to conceive?

I got a positive on #4 (four months trying back to back) and we were so excited. Part of the excitement was getting off the fucking gay babymaking rollercoaster.

Dread for the soul-crushing BFNs, the appointments, my wife\u2019s inability to comfort me, her own anger over this process and loss, the thousands on more sperm... all of this. Just dreading it.

I\u2019m currently experiencing some really frustrating issues with my body while trying to conceive... a little background- back in 2012 I experienced two miscarriages 9 months apart (both within the first trimester), the second being extremely traumatic for me. Fast forward to tail end \u201817 to mid-\u201818, I\u2019m trying to convince with my then husband... my body goes into this crazy hormone swing that over the course of 4 months (\u201817) I\u2019m experiencing pregnancy symptoms but still getting a regular period and then completely swings to the other side where for 9 months I have no period and no pregnancy and all depression, going to the ob/gyn twice a month every month I don\u2019t have a period (this all started with a false positive). The doctor couldn\u2019t find any reason why I would be experiencing these symptoms- checked for PCOS, estrogen levels, blood count, thyroid, etc.\n\nIt ended up being one of the reasons my ex and I ended up divorcing... go figure, after we split and I stopped trying my periods came back right on schedule...\nfast forward to January, I get remarried and we start talking about kids and how soon we want to start trying, as soon as we do? No period for two months straight. I\u2019m so afraid that the last miscarriage is causing not just a psychological issue but now has manifested into a physical trigger. I\u2019ve been working through my past issues concerning the loss with a therapist but it\u2019s been hard to be excited or even mindful of trying. I\u2019ve been mildly monitoring my cycles but so far have refused to acknowledge my ovulation tracking or to take the ovulation tests because of how scared I am that I\u2019m going to end up going through the same thing I experienced again.\n\nI will also add that I am married to a woman and we have a donor lined up for when we\u2019re ready to try. I\u2019m just so afraid it\u2019s not going to happen and I\u2019m terrified for her to go first because I don\u2019t want her to feel the same level of gut wrenching pain of miscarriage or even just not conceiving.\n\nI wasn\u2019t sure where else to turn where someone else would understand the sinking feeling I keep getting..", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "ttcafterloss", "subreddit_id": "t5_34scd", "subreddit_subscribers": 7650, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Anxiety to even try", "total_awards_received": 0, "treatment_tags": [], "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/ttcafterloss/comments/hhp90d/anxiety_to_even_try/"}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "mommyofanangel", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_6nt9a2uk", "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_premium": false, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1593389715, "domain": "i.redd.it", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/ttcafterloss/comments/hhplg8/clearblue_digital_ovulation_test_said_negative/", "gildings": {}, "id": "hhplg8", "is_crosspostable": false, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": true, "is_robot_indexable": false, "is_self": false, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 1, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/ttcafterloss/comments/hhplg8/clearblue_digital_ovulation_test_said_negative/", "pinned": false, "post_hint": "image", "preview": {"enabled": true, "images": [{"id": "0uXiNNzep1UUrnpS1c9vlYt0yyAA57o9R3foPvF3K1g", "resolutions": [{"height": 144, "url": "https://preview.redd.it/t0h9twr5sq751.jpg?width=108&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=feb9a9b2bf2fbf8b59f95086a01af44c33acc456", "width": 108}, {"height": 288, "url": "https://preview.redd.it/t0h9twr5sq751.jpg?width=216&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=05a59033a1e34a40e15de83e182a1475cb18739a", "width": 216}, {"height": 426, "url": "https://preview.redd.it/t0h9twr5sq751.jpg?width=320&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=49e1891c2740ba09bdc666ff12d2923ad0d8c413", "width": 320}, {"height": 853, "url": "https://preview.redd.it/t0h9twr5sq751.jpg?width=640&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c5bf0c7c22183f393d0e6e8dcc54d1ab1d83b80a", "width": 640}, {"height": 1280, "url": "https://preview.redd.it/t0h9twr5sq751.jpg?width=960&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6b31dcb5abc835672597be187f206f32663d68c1", "width": 960}, {"height": 1440, "url": "https://preview.redd.it/t0h9twr5sq751.jpg?width=1080&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6eebc0e60756fa77a4f241f4b9c42c4b56bccc93", "width": 1080}], "source": {"height": 4032, "url": "https://preview.redd.it/t0h9twr5sq751.jpg?auto=webp&amp;s=a6458f32096e4e729316dcef1eec75aa3d563397", "width": 3024}, "variants": {}}]}, "removed_by_category": "moderator", "retrieved_on": 1593398348, "score": 1, "selftext": "", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "ttcafterloss", "subreddit_id": "t5_34scd", "subreddit_subscribers": 7650, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "image", "thumbnail_height": 140, "thumbnail_width": 140, "title": "Clearblue digital ovulation test said negative but what about the lines?

I mistakenly went out of town with my husband and ended up passing the miscarriage in a walmart on the way home, after that the cramping stopped almost immediately. My HCG levels dropped from 8000 to 400 in a week, and my nurse said that confirmed that it was passed, and that i might still have some bleeding for some time. I had some spotting and then it stopped completely for 1 whole day. 2 days ago I noticed some very dark spotting so I knew it was old blood and figured that it was finally at the end of everything, this morning I woke up with weird cramping (period, poop cramps lol) and now I'm bleeding again, and it's a little more than spotting, but a little less then actual bleeding, and it's red again. I have to go back in on the 6th of next month for my last HCG screening, and I'm not sure if this is something to worry about since she was adamant that the worst has passed and my HCG levels have lowered enough to where she isn't worried about an infection, it doesn't smell \"foul\" so I'm sure that it isn't an infection, but I also shouldn't be getting my period a week after my miscarriage passed. I'm just worried and don't want to bother my doctor with this. I just want to go to the bathroom one day without seeing blood. After this though, I will never take for granted a period that lasts a week of me wearing a pad. I'm so sick of wearing these diapers at this point. \ud83d\ude41", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "ttcafterloss", "subreddit_id": "t5_34scd", "subreddit_subscribers": 7650, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "I swear everytime I think its done", "total_awards_received": 0, "treatment_tags": [], "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/ttcafterloss/comments/hhqijg/i_swear_everytime_i_think_its_done/"}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "flutterby-daisy", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_4qo956r3", "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_premium": false, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1593397829, "domain": "self.ttcafterloss", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/ttcafterloss/comments/hhrmnw/im_constantly_worried_im_going_to_miscarry_and_it/", "gildings": {}, "id": "hhrmnw", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_css_class": "vent", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_template_id": "e465bc62-beec-11e4-a607-22000b6b9cb2", "link_flair_text": "Vent", "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": false, "num_comments": 9, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/ttcafterloss/comments/hhrmnw/im_constantly_worried_im_going_to_miscarry_and_it/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1593403093, "score": 7, "selftext": "I miscarried in April, we tried this month, and I\u2019m already getting symptoms back that vanished in April.

I was 8.5 weeks with no heartbeat and measured at 6weeks - medically managed with misoprostyl (actually passed the fetal tissue in the shower on my 33rd birthday), and another chemical in May at 33 years old. The MMC products of conception were karyotyped, and it was a normal 46xx female embryo. We are now working with an RE, who has been a wonderful support. We are also lucky to live in Illinois, where much of fertility treatment is covered by insurance!\n\nI have done the RPL panel - negative for diabetes, anticardiolipin, antiphospholipid, lupus anticoagulant. TSH and T4 are normal, but I am positive for TPO antibodies. I have been put on 25 mg of Synthroid, and my TSH is now 1.9 (it was about 2.3 or so before Synthroid). From what I understand, there is a correlation between having TPO antibodies and RPL, but mixed results in studies on whether taking Synthroid actually helps reduce risk of miscarriage in this population. I did an SIS in April before the third loss and they found a 5mm fibroid within the uterine cavity, although my OB was not concerned. I am getting a myomectomy per my RE's suggestions next week to remove it. All my other blood work is \u201cnormal\u201d - day 3 FSH is 9, day 3 estradiol is 33, and AMH is 2.0 (I think this may be on the lower end of normal for 33 years old, but my RE is not worried about it and says it\u2019s normal nonetheless). I am worried about my AFC - it\u2019s somewhere between 6-8, which everywhere I have read says is low. My doctor says it\u2019s on the low end of normal, although she anticipated higher for my age, but I can\u2019t tell if she is assuaging me or not. \n\nSo, I feel completely stuck as to what to do next. We have had no trouble conceiving any of the times we\u2019ve tried, it only takes about 3 months or so to conceive. But clearly none have stuck, but that was also before the Synthroid, removing the fibroid, and progesterone support (which my RE is going to prescribe to me in the luteal phase if we choose to not do IVF and try naturally). We are considering IVF with PGS, but with my AFC I am not convinced it\u2019s the best approach. We also miscarried a chromosomally normal embryo before. I know ultimately it\u2019s about egg quality over quantity, but I\u2019d rather not go through several retrievals. I also feel like maybe it would be best to just keep trying on our own - I\u2019ve read that upwards of 60% of women with RPL will eventually carry to term. I have started to take COQ10, DHEA, fish oil, selenium along with my prenatal, vitamin d3, etc, and trying to avoid plastic and artificial fragrances, as well as attempting to drink less, all in hopes of improving egg quality.\n\nI know no one can make a decision for me, but I am really torn between trying the old fashioned way while I\u2019m still in my \u201cgood years\u201d, with the addition of removing the fibroid, having progesterone and Synthroid, or potentially risk losing some of that time to IVF with PGS which also yields no guarantee. We also are not planning on living in IL for much longer, so feel some pressure to use the IVF coverage while we have it, and while my embryos will still be 33, as opposed to changing my mind a few years down the line when I am older and have to pay out of pocket in a different state.\n\nAny thoughts?

Is there any good way of knowing whether this is a period or just more post-miscarriage spotting?", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "ttcafterloss", "subreddit_id": "t5_34scd", "subreddit_subscribers": 7657, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Spotting or Period?", "total_awards_received": 0, "treatment_tags": [], "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/ttcafterloss/comments/hierlb/spotting_or_period/"}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "squeeze-penguin", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_6fmgpwym", "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_premium": false, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1593487393, "domain": "self.ttcafterloss", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/ttcafterloss/comments/hifa2r/in_the_past_two_days_three_of_my_fb_friends_have/", "gildings": {}, "id": "hifa2r", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_css_class": "support", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_template_id": "0b925822-beed-11e4-97e6-22000b3c81cc", "link_flair_text": "Support", "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 10, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/ttcafterloss/comments/hifa2r/in_the_past_two_days_three_of_my_fb_friends_have/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1593487399, "score": 1, "selftext": "I\u2019m definitely excited for them, but as we all know, it\u2019s super hard not to be jealous.", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "ttcafterloss", "subreddit_id": "t5_34scd", "subreddit_subscribers": 7657, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "In the past two days, three of my FB friends have announced they\u2019re expecting, and I just ended up with another negative test. :/", "total_awards_received": 0, "treatment_tags": [], "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/ttcafterloss/comments/hifa2r/in_the_past_two_days_three_of_my_fb_friends_have/"}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "PtheloGreen", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_6emihom9", "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_premium": false, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1593492154, "domain": "self.ttcafterloss", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/ttcafterloss/comments/higfsl/first_cycle_trying_again_plus_ovarian_cyst/", "gildings": {}, "id": "higfsl", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 4, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/ttcafterloss/comments/higfsl/first_cycle_trying_again_plus_ovarian_cyst/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1593492158, "score": 1, "selftext": "I lost my first pregnancy at 15 weeks, on April 16th.  I had a subchorionic bleed that presented itself 10 days before my loss, and ultimately resulted in PPROM.  It's wild to think that it's been almost 11 weeks since that happened. In order to get myself out of some pretty deep despair, I've had to grow in a lot of ways.  Talking to a therapist and a holistic health coach has been super helpful. I've called on all of the support and resources I knew how.  And I am surprised at how strong I feel. \n\nThat said, the fear crops up from time to time, especially as I'm now on day 4 of the cycle during which my husband and I have decided to try again.  For a while after the MC I was convinced that the same thing would inevitably happen the next time I tried. It was like seeing the outcome of loss put me in this extremely negative headspace and I felt like I would never have a live baby. I am now in a better headspace and am open to the possibility that everything could be fine, and am simultaneously trying not to be attached to any expectation this time around.  Man, miscarriage really is a mind f\\*ck.\n\nI went in for an ultrasound yesterday as there was some question of a possible fibroid when I had my last ultrasound before my MC. The results are that I do not have any fibroids (yay) but I do have a cyst on my ovary.  Not sure if or how this will affect anything moving forward but I was given the go ahead to try from my OB. \n\nI'm not really asking a question. More just saying that now that I have these ultrasound results, that I don't have a fibroid... I feel like I'm at the very beginning of the next chapter of an already emotional journey.
