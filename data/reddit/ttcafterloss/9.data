I know I'm still in a recovery stage technically as a MC may change what is considered normal for my cycles, but they seem to not have been affected much.\n\nNow for my inquiry: my gut instinct is that I'm not pregnant (mostly because I don't quite want to be; I planned to start trying again next month), but I can't help feeling like I'm spotting symptoms like crazy. AF is about 5/6 days late and I'm experiencing cramping (for 3 days or so) with a brief period of more painful cramps this morning. Last night I was experiencing a crazy amount of very white, very thick CM. This morning there was less CM and some tinted pink. I've also been experiencing horrible constipation today and yesterday (never ever ever happens to me!). I ended up taking a test this morning after seeing the pink CM, but I got a BFN \n\nDoes anyone have any similar experiences or opinions about my info?

I tested positive at 11DPO (Friday, only 6 days ago?!), again for 3 days after that, and then on Wednesday afternoon I started to bleed, hard.\n\nI guess I had always been nervous about this pregnancy, partly because everything was falling into place: it was only cycle 2 TTC, my dad's birthday and his grandfather's visit both fell on a week that we were planning to tell our families, the due date was great for our work schedules. And, most of all, starting a few days before my BFP, I had a mysterious pain in my right pelvis that felt a lot like ovulation pain. This is why I kept POAS for so many days--just to see the line get darker.\n\nIt turned out the right pelvic pain may have been a clue as to the cause. I went to the ER almost as soon as I saw the blood, where I got a urine test, bloodwork, and an transvaginal ultrasound. Negative urine test. hCG of 9. NINE! And the US pointed to the possible cause: a leiomyoma (fibroid) on the right side. I had ovulated on the right, and there was evidence that the fibroid may have been the site of implantation.\n\nAt the time we had scheduled a first appointment with an OB that wasn't close to where I work, so I called an OB near me and they sent me to the ER. I have a followup appointment with our original OB in two weeks, and I have a million questions that are just going to plague us until we see the new OB. The ED doc didn't have a lot to tell us. So I thought I'd ask my questions here.\n\nFirst, has anyone experienced a miscarriage caused by implantation on a leiomyoma?\n\nDoes anyone know whether a leiomyoma can cause problems with pregnancy later on, even if it's not the site of implantation? \n\nDo you have any, any, any advice!? Anything we should prepare ourselves for in terms of further diagnoses?\n\nRight now I'm waiting out the bleeding and exploring the wikis here. Since yesterday afternoon I've been resting and my husband has been working from home. I'm hoping my cycle gets right back on track so we can start trying again. I got back into a regular cycle immediately coming off the BCP, so I'm hopeful for that.

Seeing as we were so early on when the loss occurred we have gone with the unisex names, Auburn and River. I feel like by giving our little ones names we have made the experience more real, and therefore there is more closure. I have decided I would like to get a tattoo in remembrance of them, and was wondering if anyone had any ideas?

My partner and I got pregnant with our twins in our second cycle, but I wasn't temping, charting or using OPKs, just checking cervical position once a day. Are you following a strict schedule? Or do you prefer to leave things relaxed? I've heard some mixed opinions on Vitex for regulating menstrual cycles, as I have a somewhat irregular cycle. Have you tried Vitex? If so, what did it do for you?\n\n\nSorry for the long, ranty and question-filled post.

I'm recovering from my second consecutive miscarriage, and being a data-driven person and someone looking for comfort, I've been trying to get my head around the statistics here. I've heard and read some misleading information, so I just wanted to clear up a few things that I've been thinking about lately. (But! As with all data found on the internet, who knows if it's 100% accurate...)\n\nMost folks have heard that about 20% of pregnancies end in miscarriage (may be much higher including CPs that ladies didn't recognize). The stats generally go on to say that 5% of women go on to have a second MC, and 1% have another after that. (source: [MayoClinic!](http://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-lifestyle/getting-pregnant/in-depth/pregnancy-after-miscarriage/art-20044134): *\"Miscarriage is usually a one-time occurrence. Most women who miscarry go on to have a healthy pregnancy after miscarriage. Less than 5 percent of women have two consecutive miscarriages, and only 1 percent have three or more consecutive miscarriages.\"*). However, this means 5% and 1% of the TOTAL, not 5% and 1% of women who've *already had* an MC.\n\nSo some people are like \"hey, i had one miscarriage, so there's only a 5% chance that I'll have another!\" But no, that's not it. Luckily, the truth isn't so bad:\n\nLet's say there are 100 women who get pregnant.  \n\nLet's say 80 of them have babies, and 20 miscarry.\n\nOf that 20, 5 will miscarry again next time (2 MCs total).\n\nOf that 5, 1 will miscarry again next time (3 MCs total).\n\n(20%, 5%, 1%)\n\nSO! Since ~20 out of 100 is ~20%, and 5 out of 20 is 25%, and 1 out of 5 is 20%, **EACH MC UP TO 3 MC's has nearly the same rate/risk of MC as the first one!!!** For some reason this really helped me.

We did timed intercourse and found that we were also looking at MFI. \n\nI switched to a RE and was diagnosed with a uterine fibroid acting like an IUD. I had it removed and did 3 IUIs. Still no success. We moved on to IVF. The fresh transfer failed. \n\nWe did an FET on July 8th  where two embryos were transferred. Our first beta hCG was 56 10dp5dt and we were thrilled. It was the first positive we had in nearly three years of trying.  Our next beta didn't double. We were still hopeful because we knew two had been transferred maybe one dropped off.  The third beta also didn't double.  We began coming to grips with the thought that we lost it.  I pushed for a fourth beta on 16dp5dt just to be certain before discontinuing hormone support.  In 6 days it went from 56 to 90. \n\nWe stopped medication on Friday and now I'm waiting for my period.
