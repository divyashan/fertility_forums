I feel the most frustrating thing is not knowing what I could of done better, and what I can try to do better to conceive after this miscarriage. Every doctor, nurse, midwife I've spoken to for both of my losses have said the same thing to me. That two early trimester miscarriages are very common, so common that they do not actually have much studies or answers to give me. I'm 33, healthy, I keep active and try to follow a very balanced diet, and all I hear is to just keep doing what I'm doing and I should have no problem conceiving again. This is so not reassuring to me, and I just keep running through my head everything I could of done differently or better. Just wanted to ask what helped others during this time, what advice was given to you after your loss, any advice on what I could look into to try and make my next attempt more successful?

The following day, which was also my first day at a brand new job, I had pretty uncomfortable cramping. I rushed home during the lunch break to take another test, hoping that I'd be able to show the even darker lines to my husband and celebrate together before going back to work. This test was way lighter, and I went back devastated, knowing that I was having a CP. It took a few more days for my period to finally come, with one final negative test the day before it finally arrived. \n\nThis cycle, which is our first actively trying, I tried to be really optimistic. I never got a truly positive OPK, but wasn't able to do these consistently due to work and travel, so figured that was still OK.

I'd also had more CM than usual during my LP.\n\nWe are currently on our honeymoon and I thought about how amazing it would be to have a BFP during this trip. I held off as long as I possibly could, and then took a test this AM on what I think is probably 11 DPO. It was the starkest BFN.\n\nI'm trying not to let it get to me, because I know that two cycles is so early in the scheme of things. But I can't help worrying that there's something wrong with my body and I'll never carry a pregnancy to term. I guess I just wanted to vent a bit since I don't feel comfortable sharing how I'm feeling with any friends/family, as I don't want people to know we're TTC.\n\nThanks for reading this novel!", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "ttcafterloss", "subreddit_id": "t5_34scd", "subreddit_subscribers": 6889, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Feel like a bit of an imposter but here I am!", "total_awards_received": 0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/ttcafterloss/comments/f6loga/feel_like_a_bit_of_an_imposter_but_here_i_am/"}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "mercurialmaam", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_5qefwlmy", "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_premium": false, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1582182455, "domain": "self.ttcafterloss", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/ttcafterloss/comments/f6pd2g/ft_stillbirth/", "gildings": {}, "id": "f6pd2g", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 11, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/ttcafterloss/comments/f6pd2g/ft_stillbirth/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1582182456, "score": 1, "selftext": "I literally just joined reddit and I'm not sure what I'm doing yet lol.

It's surprisingly difficult to get grief counseling where I live.\n\nOur 3rd daughter was due in August. I had my 40 week appt at 39/6, and I asked ob if he could send me to get my water broken. He refused. He told me that he'd like to wait another week and then considered scheduling an induction. I was 4cm and 60% effaced. My other 2 girls were both born at 39/6, and they both required intervention. 1st was an induction and my water was broken with the 2nd. I went to L&amp;D at 40/5 because I was concerned and I asked to be induced. They said that my water was intact and baby's heartrate was good so I had to go home. She died that night while I was sleeping. The next morning I was induced and she was delivered 2.5 hours later. \n\nIdk how to process what happened to me. I'm so incredibly traumatized! I've been crying myself to sleep for 6 months. I'm angry that no one would help me... she'd be here now if they had. I'm 37 so this was to be my last but now I feel like there's a huge hole in our lives where the 3rd child should have been. I want to try again but I'm afraid. I'm afraid that I'll be an anxiety-ridden mess the whole pregnancy. I'm afraid that there'll be something wrong with the next baby because of my age. Most of all, I'm afraid that it'll happen again. \n\nNothing but time will ease the distress I'm feeling but I'm glad that I found a group of others who can in some ways empathize with me. I'm so very sorry for your losses. *hugs*", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "ttcafterloss", "subreddit_id": "t5_34scd", "subreddit_subscribers": 6890, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "FT Stillbirth", "total_awards_received": 0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/ttcafterloss/comments/f6pd2g/ft_stillbirth/"}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "AutoModerator", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_6l4z3", "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_premium": true, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1582182524, "domain": "self.ttcafterloss", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/ttcafterloss/comments/f6pdhh/ttcafterloss_daily_discussion_thread_1_february/", "gildings": {}, "id": "f6pdhh", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 6, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/ttcafterloss/comments/f6pdhh/ttcafterloss_daily_discussion_thread_1_february/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1582182525, "score": 1, "selftext": "**How are you doing today?

At 37, I was worried it may take us a while to conceive but we were lucky enough to conceive in our third month (my first son took nearly a year, and I was much younger then). The timing seemed perfect and our baby even shared a due date with my younger child--October 9. \n\nHowever, as week 5 came and went, I started to get nervous. I had no morning sickness. With both of my living children I had been extremely sick from weeks 4-11. Vomiting up to 8 times per day and just feeling generally awful. With this pregnancy, I felt great. No vomiting, no food aversions. I could even drink coffee. Everyone said to consider myself lucky but it felt wrong. By 6.5 weeks I was really concerned. My OB's nurse told me not to worry, as each pregnancy is different. My OB, however, said she trusted women's intuitions about their bodies and sent me for an HCG draw. I got my test done and that same night while I was awaiting results, I went to the bathroom and noticed pink on the tissue. My heart sank and I started crying. The spotting turned bright red and I was up all night with painful cramping. I cried all night for my little October baby. \n\nThe next morning I called my OB's office and told them what was going on. They said to hang tight and someone would get back to me. I waited 7 hours and tried to stay busy at work but I really should have stayed home. I had an important meeting but I cried all day and was generally useless. My bleeding had intensified and my cramping very much hurt but I didn't want to take anything for it, not knowing for sure that it was a loss. \n\nFinally I got frustrated and called back. They told me I needed an ultrasound right away so I had to drop everything and run to get one before the radiology dept closed. Because I had to leave work suddenly, I needed to tell my bosses what was happening and that was tough. I was frustrated that no one mentioned an ultrasound when I called that morning. (With my first miscarriage, I did not get one.) \n\nThe ultrasound was uncomfortable and I had to wait a half hour after for the radiologist to review the slides and talk to my doctor. I then (wrongly) assumed that either the radiologist or my doctor would tell me what was going on. Instead, the tech sent me home and said my doctor would call me in the morning and he couldn't say anything else. I was so upset. I knew I'd lost the baby but you're really going to let me go home and bleed all night and not even tell me if my baby died?  My OB did end up calling me in the evening, at least, and did not make me wait until morning. She said there was nothing in my uterus and my HCG was lower than she'd expect for how far along I was.

I'm on cycle three post resolution of that ectopic and my ovulation test just doesn't make sense to me.\n\nLonger version:\n\nI had three rounds of MTX from August to November to resolve an ectopic (my first and only pregnancy thus far at age 36). I had a 40 day cycle after I finally resolved the ectopic where I didn't TTC (doctor's advice).\n\nThen I had a 28 day cycle where I did TTC, but my ovulation tests didn't really line up with my temp data. My chart has an orange dot for ovluation on CD 14 last cycle, which aligns with the peak ovulation test from the day before.\n\nNow I'm on my second cycle of trying again, and got a surprise peak ovulation test today on CD 9. (I've never had one this early before, even when I was TTC last year before my ectopic. I always got my temp shift and peak ovluation test in sync and usually between CD12-14.) The ovulation tests I took on this cycle CD 7 and 8 were negative. Fortunately we did the whole BD thing last night.\n\nPart of me panicked and immmeditely took a pregnancy test, because this is how my ectopic happened last time. I had had my period, and when I had taken an ovulation test it was a dye stealer. So I had then taken a pregnancy test and it was positive. No such positive pregnancy test today, so I'm hoping that's a good sign that I'm not having that bullshit ectopic thing happen again.\n\nI am just so frustrated. Could this be a false start kinda deal, where I don't actually release an egg despite a surge? I've read about some women having two LH surges.

I\u2019ve been going to the same yoga studio for years. It\u2019s a community I love. And even when there are times I don\u2019t go regularly, I always go back. When I found out I was pregnant I had been in a yoga lull. And I started going to their yoga mama class as a way to get more exercise. It got me back into the studio, and back into a community that is warm and welcoming. \n\nI started going back to the regular classes shortly after the procedure. It helped me with feel grounded, and allowed me to continue to process my grief in a safe space. Basically, it\u2019s a moving metrication that helps me work through my feelings and not grow stagnant, so I sometimes cry during class. The lights are usually low, so I don\u2019t think I bother other classmates, and it\u2019s good for me. So I\u2019ve been continuing to go. I usually leave class feeling good, even though I\u2019m a little emotionally raw. \nToday\u2019s flow was hard. The instructor, who I adore and look up to, would occasionally add instruction that \u201cif you\u2019re expecting\u201d to not do fire breath or give some other modifications. It made me feel even more vulnerable than normal. After class, when I was in the lobby getting ready to I realized why these instructions kept happening. There was this lovely lady who was seven months pregnant in the class. The instructor was oooing over her belly and excitedly asking the mom to be questions. I broke. I couldn\u2019t stop the tears, left as quickly as I could, and cried the whole way home. It felt like the scab was ripped off again, when it had just started to heal. \n\nI just wish I could go through my days without being triggered. I don\u2019t blame others for it. I just wish I could heal to the point that instances like this, or seeing parents with their small children didn\u2019t cause me to fight back tears. Some days seem so much more normal.

I checked my cervix after that and got some obvious clear ewcm that stretched about 10cm, with no trace of blood (directly after I had wiped) I figured period was coming any moment as I'd been lightly crampy and moody.

I took a test because 8days prior my hcg was only down to 573 so I ordered a bunch of tests and planned to do a test every Friday until I got a negative, then hopefully positives again after that with a new pregnancy. The test was extremely faint positive. I thought ok I must be able to ovulate my hcg has quickly gone down, yah! I put my moon cup in just incase my period started over night, when I woke up there was just 1 drop of blood mixed with clear ewcm. Ok weird. I checked my cervix, it was high, soft and open. That night I was sure my period would start as I had been crampy on and off and not to mention totally bloated all week. So I put my moon cup in again. The next morning (today) I took it out and there was even less blood and ewcm then the day before. I checked my cervix and this time it was so high I could almost not reach it, completely open and the softest it's ever been, like mush almost! I did another test hoping it would be completely negative but instead it was slightly darker than the one 2 days prior, but I had drunk alcohol the night before and it may have dehydrated me making the hcg stronger in urine. I was so confused, am I ovulating or am I about to get my period? I wanted to have sex but I felt damp, I wiped and was pink cm. I checked my cervix and when I pulled my finger out it was bright red blood, no mucous. Ok so I AM getting my period. I put the cup in again. A few hours later I take it out to clean it before bed, it's EMPTY? So, just incase I AM ovulating, my husband and I had sex. No blood residue on him or I after or the toilet paper I wiped with.

Brief history since i\u2019m sure most of you know my story. My husband and I have been married for just over 4 years. We have been TTC since. I\u2019ve had 2 CP\u2019s, one 6 week MC, and one 10 week MMC, which we discovered january 7. I miscarried the embryo with the first round of miso, and a lot of blood, but not much tissue. They gave me a second round two weeks later and that did nothing. They finally did a D&amp;C on January 27, and after passing tissue after that, i stopped bleeding two weeks ago after bleeding for a month. The doctor didn\u2019t do any genetic testing even though i asked him to and he is just now interested in testing for autoimmune issues. It\u2019s a reality that i may never have bio children and that hit me hard while recovering. I am just now starting to feel physically and emotionally a little bit more like myself.\n\nDuring all of this, my SIL, who was 22 weeks pregnant with a low-lying placenta, decided to go on a cruise, which lasted 5 days and included a 28 hour round trip car ride. On the last day, she woke up around midnight covered in blood and clots. They rushed her to the port and then to the hospital, where they said she had a tear in her placenta. Her baby survived, and she is doing well, and NOT on full bedrest. Her mother was on the cruise with her and therefore experienced her issues firsthand, and learned of our loss around the same time. \n\nDuring the weeks since she got home, i haven\u2019t been able to go see her. All she talks about is the baby and who else is pregnant, and then announcing what they\u2019re having (almost all girls, like I was supposed to) so i avoid her. She also has a \u201cmeal train\u201d service so friends and family bring her dinners, flowers, etc and take her LC places. \n\nWe were left alone after receiving a few condolences. The family that knew I was so weak from blood loss after miso that I was too tired to cook never offered us dinner. After the D&amp;C, my husband had to pull some strings and come home early from work because I wasn\u2019t supposed to be alone. My MIL suggested I go sit with my SIL. My mother stepped in and sat with me, helped me clean, and cooked dinner a few times. \n\nNow. MIL and FIL just came home from vacation. After helping them unpack today, my MIL waited until we were alone and unleashed a tirade of anger, about how no one in the family can believe that we didn\u2019t cook for them, how i\u2019m selfish and self-centered, and how they were excited about our baby but now it\u2019s time to focus on SIL and her bay, etc. She then looked at me and said she understood the lack of contact during the first week but that I have no excuse after that.

Found out it wasn\u2019t a viable pregnancy January 13, and had to be rushed to the hospital for an emergency D&amp;C one week later.\n\nThe whole ordeal was traumatic. And I\u2019ve been just devastated at the thought that I may never be able to give my son a sibling or at least not one close to him in age.\n\nThen last week, my son got sick on our cruise vacation with my in-laws. He\u2019s fine, but was feverish and snotty and just in a terrible mood. The three of us slept very poorly all week since he had to sleep between us in our bed and would toss, turn, and scream all night. He threw more and worse tantrums than we\u2019ve ever seen from him.\n\nWe still had fun, don\u2019t get me wrong. And we handled it the best we could, but it was rough. He wasn\u2019t feeling good, was in an unfamiliar place, and is two years old. Of course he acted up.\n\nBut for that time, I was grateful to be the parent of an only child. Our focus was on him. No older sibling who was losing out on his/her vacation with their parents because mom and dad kept having to tend to younger brother. No little baby sibling who would be woken and upset by his tantrums.\n\nI\u2019ve always wanted more than one child. And honestly, I still do. But I\u2019ve been so desperate for another, so dejected by my failure to get pregnant for nearly a year followed by a loss when it finally happened.

After my D&amp;C last Wednesday at 11w6d, my boss told me yesterday that he'll be leaving our nonprofit in 6 months at the end of August. So, not only am I facing not having a baby in September, but losing my very favorite colleague. We're a teeeeny-tiiiiiiny group with 3 full-time staff members and I took this job across the country about 4.5 years ago just to be able to work with my boss. OH and I also just bought a house closer to family and in a city we love, so I work from home two days a week and commute about 100 miles each way, three days a week to keep working with my team. I've never worked with an executive director as awesome as my boss and would move mountains for him. I'm devastated on so many levels about all that has gone on in this last week. Anyway...\n\nWe are TTC, as soon as the dr clears me, which should be in about 6 weeks. So, best case, if I get pregnant again quickly and all goes well this time, I'd be delivering in January - February 2021. I'm on the older side of TTC and so I'm not skipping any months of TTC, so I need to figure out the best timeline for job hunting, while also considering maternity leave. I've got really transferable skills in the nonprofit world and about 18 years of experience and should be able to find work near our new house relatively easily. That said, my field is small and relies on good relationships and everrrrrryone knows if you burn bridges. Here are my thoughts and I'd love to hear your advice, experience, etc.\n\n\\- **Start Job Hunting Now:** I risk upsetting my current colleagues and board of directors (thus, risking future recommendations, etc.). I know my board is expecting me to be an integral part of the search process and staff transition. \n\n\\- **Job Hunt After the New Boss Starts:** I could be showing while interviewing, which feels dangerous for my prospects. I also don't love the idea of starting a new job and then going on maternity leave right away.\n\n\\- **Take Maternity Leave at Current Job, Stay for a Few Months, then Job Hunt:** I'm leaning toward this. It locks me into staying at my job for probably another 18 months, if all goes well on the TTC front. \n\nObviously, if I'm not pregnant by the time my boss leaves, all this is moot, but I'm a planner and I like to have a road map.", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "ttcafterloss", "subreddit_id": "t5_34scd", "subreddit_subscribers": 6898, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Job Hunting and TTC?", "total_awards_received": 0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/ttcafterloss/comments/f919dv/job_hunting_and_ttc/"}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "juju1107", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_z3iws", "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_premium": false, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1582595177, "domain": "self.ttcafterloss", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/ttcafterloss/comments/f92eb1/lh_strips/", "gildings": {}, "id": "f92eb1", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 10, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/ttcafterloss/comments/f92eb1/lh_strips/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1582595179, "score": 1, "selftext": "Do they work for everyone?

No repeat losses, no late losses, no massively long time period of infertility. That\u2019s part of why I honestly don\u2019t get why this hurts so much. \n\nI got pregnant by accident two years ago at the age of 26. I wanted to go ahead with the pregnancy, but it turned out to be a MMC at around the 7 week mark. I was still long distance with my husband, unsupported by my family, incredibly stressed about the pregnancy itself, and had to wait two and a half weeks before getting a D+C. It caused a period of pretty bad acute PTSD and I haven\u2019t been the same since.\n\nNow my husband and I live together and have been TTC for 6 months (7 cycles) now. I have mild endometriosis, but my family has excellent fertility, so I figured it would happen right away. I\u2019ve been doing everything right. Testing, tracking, timing everything, taking the fancy prenatals and a couple other supplements, I won\u2019t even touch caffeine. And...nothing. I can reliably take a pregnancy test in a few days, and I was hopeful about this cycle (I seemed to actually ovulate as per my BBT chart, which doesn\u2019t seem to happen every time), but I\u2019m pretty sure my period is coming. I think my luteal phases are too short (10 days), but there isn\u2019t a whole lot I can do about that now. \n\nI saw an endometriosis specialist a few weeks back, and she\u2019s not opposed to doing an excision surgery, especially since I last had a laparoscopy 9 years ago. But since I\u2019m not in extreme pain and mainly want to get/stay pregnant, we decided a better plan would be to refer me to a fertility clinic in the same building. My appointment is in June. I know it\u2019s not technically infertility until the one year mark has passed, but because of my diagnosis and previous loss, they\u2019ll take me after 6 months of trying. \n\nAt the same appointment, I saw my old surgical records, and I found out my MMC in 2018 was basically an empty sac with some placenta tissue. Which was gutting. I was talking to an empty mass I thought of as a baby. My husband and I thought he was a boy. We named him. I\u2019m really spiritual and always thought I\u2019d see him again in some kind of afterlife one day. But since I found out about the empty sac, it feels weird and artificial to say his name. And I used to picture him as this little chunky redhead baby (my husband\u2019s a ginger), but I can\u2019t see him in my mind anymore. And I hate it. It gave me some kind of bittersweet comfort, and for now, it\u2019s mostly gone. \n\nTo top it all off, I\u2019m pretty sure someone I considered a good friend, who went radio silent as soon as she would have found out she was pregnant (I only found out this was the likely reason months later by way of a public announcement), has just straight-up ghosted and is not coming back. I\u2019m giving her some leeway as she\u2019s busy juggling career stuff (she\u2019s a musician, as am I, she was kind of a mentor to me, that\u2019s how we met) and raising her infant daughter, but I just don\u2019t feel good about it. I sent her a really heartfelt message she might not have even looked at. So not only have I probably lost a friend, it\u2019s a reminder that she\u2019s joined the mom club, and I\u2019m not there.", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "ttcafterloss", "subreddit_id": "t5_34scd", "subreddit_subscribers": 6902, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Everything feels terrible and unfair and bleak.", "total_awards_received": 0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/ttcafterloss/comments/f9lbui/everything_feels_terrible_and_unfair_and_bleak/"}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "Purple_soup", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_gdtu7", "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_premium": false, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1582685366, "domain": "self.ttcafterloss", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/ttcafterloss/comments/f9mbn7/endometrial_growth_after_dc_and_cytotec_looking/", "gildings": {}, "id": "f9mbn7", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 6, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/ttcafterloss/comments/f9mbn7/endometrial_growth_after_dc_and_cytotec_looking/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1582685373, "score": 1, "selftext": "I had my d&amp;c January 10, one month later my ultrasound showed retained tissue.

Period started Dec 29th 2019**\n\n**-I have not had any pills since**\n\n**-I tracked Ovulation from the day my period ended until I got a line on the Ovulation strip that matched the control line. This day was the 17th, meaning (at least I think) I ovulated on the 18th of Jan 2020**\n\n**-Jan 31st I saw the first traces of a positive pregnancy test, like the faiiiiiiintest line, the hold in the light and look at it the right way type of line.**\n\n**-I have been taking pregnancy tests since to keep measuring the increase and theyve all gotten darker. Except the past few days theyve been light**\n\n**-I havent had any typical \"worse than period\" cramps or pains.**\n\n**-The only instances I have that may be cause for worry are: bleeding after my husband and I had sex (after finding the first positive test) I bled for about a day and it stopped. on Feb 11th I had some spotting and some cramping but we were out to dinner and I could still be social and move around. Saturday 2/22 I had some cramping that kind of felt like gas pains from gas that I couldnt let out, and I felt like I had to waddle around. Other than that there was no pains where I felt toppled over or pains worse than period cramps.**\n\n\\-**I went to my appt yesterdat Feb 25th and when they did the internal ultrasound there was no baby. Thoughts? experiences?**\n\nSo I got more blood drawn this morning and I go in for a follow up appt today at 930 am Hawaii Standard Time.
