I honestly felt a bit sheepish because we haven\u2019t really had any issues conceiving and it had only been one month of trying after the D&amp;C.  I\u2019m so glad we decided to go.  The RE is testing for every possible issue and yesterday he found something in my uterus that is likely scar tissue from the D&amp;C and it is quite possibly hindering implantation.  If I hadn\u2019t gone to the RE we would not have known about this.  Now we can have it addressed and be in the best position possible to conceive.

Prior to TTC I had a hormonal IUD in which I did not have periods and I do not think I ovulated.\n\nMy first cycle trying I got pregnant, but had a MMC at 9 weeks, and had a d&amp;c. My period was MIA for five weeks, so second cycle wasn\u2019t until November. We did not get pregnant that cycle. I had a 25 day cycle, with an 11 day luteal cycle.  Third cycle trying, I got a late BFP and was pregnant for about two days before it ending in a chemical pregnancy today. This cycle I was tracking my progesterone with PROOV strips, and my progesterone test went negative at 9dpo. I think this means I have progesterone/luteal phase defect, but I\u2019m not sure.\n\nI got beta tests this morning and go back Saturday for my second test. It\u2019s pointless because AF is here in full force, and my FRERs have gone negative. But I\u2019m hoping my first test caught at least a little bit of hcg so this pregnancy is on record.\n\nI think I have a progesterone issue, since I seem to have no problem getting pregnant, but I cannot stay pregnant. My questions are basically \n\n- Does anyone have any thoughts on my conclusions re progesterone ?\n\n- I know low progesterone is a common culprit in early CPs, but is it possible it was related to my MMC? We saw the heartbeat and everything looked ok at 7.5 weeks, but discovered the MMC at 9 weeks.\n\n- Any advice for how to approach my doctor about progesterone supplements? I worry she is going to tel me to just keep trying for a few cycles to see if things level out, but I\u2019m really afraid to go through this again.\n\n-If she says she doesn\u2019t want to give me progesterone, are there natural ways to try to increase progesterone? I bought a bunch of seeds to try seed cycling this cycle, but I\u2019m not sure if that\u2019s likely to have any real affect.\n\nThanks", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "steward_reports": [], "stickied": false, "subreddit": "ttcafterloss", "subreddit_id": "t5_34scd", "subreddit_subscribers": 6552, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Progesterone supplements?", "total_awards_received": 0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/ttcafterloss/comments/eczem5/progesterone_supplements/"}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "thekittyweeps", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_neac9", "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_premium": false, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1576806643, "domain": "self.ttcafterloss", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/ttcafterloss/comments/ed379h/can_i_just_vent_about_how_undignified_the_whole/", "gildings": {}, "id": "ed379h", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 20, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/ttcafterloss/comments/ed379h/can_i_just_vent_about_how_undignified_the_whole/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1576806644, "score": 1, "selftext": "At least it was for me.\n\nFirst I find out that my baby doesn\u2019t have a heartbeat with a fucking wand up my vagina with a stranger trying to comfort me by patting my legs.\n\nShe calls another stranger in to join in the worst moment of life while I\u2019m still naked from the waist down and I can feel the stupid jelly dripping out of me.\n\nThen I have to pull myself together long enough to pick up the fucking pills.

I can't really fault the way she's handled it and she's a lovely person but ever since I heard this news it unlocked new layers of grief that I didn't know we're there. It's so difficult seeing the timeline I had spent so many hours dreaming about play out for them and not for me. There's anger at the injustice of it, intense jealousy and also guilt because I want to be happy for them.\n\nWe are heading back to my husband's parents for Christmas and MIL has asked us to come on Monday to have dinner with SIL before she drives back down South to spend Christmas with her in-laws. My husband thinks it's important we do this. Even my counsellor thinks it's important we do this but every fibre of me just wants to run the other way. MIL told me yesterday that \"She's huge already! Wait until you see her belly\" which hasn't helped at all.

Why is my track record so shitty and other women just can't stop having babies? It's such a crappy system.  We should just be able to put in an order for healthy pregnancy and baby and get that. Human reproductive systems suck. \n\n\nThis post brought to you by holiday parties full of pregnant relatives and self pity.", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "steward_reports": [], "stickied": false, "subreddit": "ttcafterloss", "subreddit_id": "t5_34scd", "subreddit_subscribers": 6555, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "How do so many women get pregnant accidentally?", "total_awards_received": 0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/ttcafterloss/comments/edc6ge/how_do_so_many_women_get_pregnant_accidentally/"}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "Fillimilli", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_f3iix", "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_premium": false, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1576863003, "domain": "self.ttcafterloss", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/ttcafterloss/comments/edd789/trying_to_prepare_for_the_worst_news/", "gildings": {}, "id": "edd789", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 5, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/ttcafterloss/comments/edd789/trying_to_prepare_for_the_worst_news/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1576863004, "score": 1, "selftext": "I\u2019ve had four ultrasounds and have seen the sac, but no baby.

I mean no one talks about this stuff right? Anyone I knew who got pregnant you assume their first success sticks. This was my first pregnancy ever. I\u2019ve never had a scare in my 36 years on earth! \n\nAnyways, the doctor told us there was no fetus. We cried. A lot. Waited a week. Nothing happened on it\u2019s own, so I got the pills and then bleed for about a month. It was devastating. At first I didn\u2019t know how i\u2019d get over it. Our due date was going to be January 4, 2020.  \n\nIt was a hard summer. I drank a lot to cope. My period returned to normal and we started in September trying again. Each month was a disappointment when nothing happened. \n\nSince nothing was happening I made a crazy decision. I switched jobs after 7 years with one company and moved to a completely different industry. \n\nThen as luck would have it....I find out I\u2019m pregnant again a week into my new job.  Great! A bit awkward but I live in Canada so I\u2019m lucky that I\u2019ll be able to take maternity leave no problem. My due date is estimated for Aug 1, 2020.\n\nYesterday we went in for our first ultrasound. My doctor was a saint and managed to get us in before the holidays so that we could confirm things were progressing and tell our parents at Christmas. I knew there was still a risk in things not working out but my doctors said that after one MC my chances of another are decreased so I was hopeful. I bought ornaments off of Etsy that said \u201cGrandma and Grandpa EST 2020\u201d as gifts to surprise them. \n\nOk, back to the ultrasound. I filled my bladder to the top! Like seriously, I thought I was going to pee my pants but I wanted to be in the best position as possible for them to see something. It happened again. I was supposed to be 8 weeks and they saw nothing. \n\nI\u2019m just numb now. My family doctor has been an amazing support. I just got my blood taken this afternoon so she can double check that my levels are declining but I really feel like these last two month have been just....I dunno...fake. Like my body is lying to me. The nausea, sore breast, feeling in my stomach. It\u2019s all fake. How can I trust my body again? Are two blighted ovums normal? Is this my bodies was of saying I\u2019m just too old and should stop trying...and even if I\u2019m successful would a full term pregnancy result in a child with abnormalities? \n\nI\u2019m turning 37 in March and things and just looking hopeless. \n\nI know there are so many others in worse situations and who have been trying harder but I just wanted to vent cause if you can vent to women in r/ttcafterloss who can you?!\n\nThanks for listening. \ud83d\udc99", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "steward_reports": [], "stickied": false, "subreddit": "ttcafterloss", "subreddit_id": "t5_34scd", "subreddit_subscribers": 6552, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Second blighted ovum...seriously WTF!?", "total_awards_received": 0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/ttcafterloss/comments/edifdm/second_blighted_ovumseriously_wtf/"}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "amugglestruggle", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_3olscdu5", "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_premium": false, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1576889325, "domain": "self.ttcafterloss", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/ttcafterloss/comments/editkv/im_so_over_this/", "gildings": {}, "id": "editkv", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_css_class": "vent", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_template_id": "e465bc62-beec-11e4-a607-22000b6b9cb2", "link_flair_text": "Vent", "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 8, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/ttcafterloss/comments/editkv/im_so_over_this/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1576889327, "score": 1, "selftext": "My last period was 100% a period.

Then they took a couple more x-rays and consulted with a foot specialist orthopedic surgeon. He suggested they sedate me and attempt to align it a little better just to see if they could get me a couple days to let the swelling subside before they attempted surgery.\n\nApparently the pain was too intense for the propofol to actually sedate me enough to not fight them. they did, according to my husband, get it a little straighter but when they asked the surgeon to look at the new films, he wasn't satisfied. He said I needed surgery right away.\n\nThey weren't sure before going into the OR if my swelling was down enough to do one surgery and place the permanent hardware to correct it or if they would have to do external pins and rods in the meantime and a second surgery later.\n\nLuckily, they did it in one surgery because they were pleased with it not being as swollen as they anticipated.\n\nI have a plate with 6 pins holding my fibula together and 2 screws holding my tibia together.

I was admitted for severe preeclampsia at 21.3 and terminated at 21.5 in early November. \n\nThe core question I'm working on answering is \"How do I categorize this within my own mind?\" The first question my councilor and I are digging into is was this our first pregnancy or first child? (pregnancy I think is what I'm settling on) I know many of you would answer this question very differently for yourselves, but I'm trying to figure out the right answers for me. \n\nAnd boy oh boy do I have some feelings.\n\n----\n\nWe named her Jane. I told everyone we named her Jane because I wanted people to know. But I don't know why I want you to know she had a name, and I like to see it written down, but I don't like it when you say it to me out loud. It makes me feel like you think she was more of a person than she was. \n\nI don't consider myself a mother, though I've been through labor and half a pregnancy. \n\nWas this a stillbirth? A miscarriage? A termination? I've used all the words and none of them capture everything.\n\nI had a choice and want you to acknowledge that. Don't say \"you didn't really have a choice\" because my health was in danger. I felt fine the whole time. It was *possible* we could have managed my heath for a few weeks. But also don't act like I should have done something else.\n\nMy sister in law is pregnant. My pregnancy was supposed to end up the first grandchild. But my sister in law's child will be the first grandchild now. That makes me sad, but I don't want you to \"honor\" my loss by offering to call Jane your first grandchild. \n\nI don't think of her as my child but I do think of her as my daughter. She never got to be a child. \n\nWas she a baby or a fetus?\n\nShe wasn't a person (yet). \n\nI like it when you acknowledge that it happened, but I don't want you to dwell on the loss part. I can talk about the medical stuff for hours and educate you on pre-e. I mean, I was in the hospital for 5 days. \n\nI'm angry that this happened and jealous of those around me, but I also want to be engaged and joyous. Don't talk about how incredibly excited you are, but don't avoid the subject entirely to spare my feelings. \n\nI am uncomfortable watching an episode of Gilmore Girls where Shari has Gigi but I specifically watched the episode of Downton Abbey where (spoiler alert) Sybil has eclampsia and dies. \n\nI am ready to be pregnant again but terrified of losing another in the same way. \n\nMy grandmother's name was Jane. We didn't name her after her specifically, but liked that there was a family connection. Don't tell me that baby Jane is with Grandma Jane. \n\nMy grandmother lived to be 93 and had a life and experience that deserves memory. There's nothing about my Jane *to* remember except for possibility.\n\nI'm grieving the possibility of a person. Don't tell me you're thinking of Jane, tell me you're thinking of me.\n\nDon't ignore it. But don't dwell on it. But let me talk about it and dwell on it if I want to. \n\n-----\n\nTLDR: I'm confused and still sorting out what I think.", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "steward_reports": [], "stickied": false, "subreddit": "ttcafterloss", "subreddit_id": "t5_34scd", "subreddit_subscribers": 6548, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Categorization frustration", "total_awards_received": 0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/ttcafterloss/comments/edrpt0/categorization_frustration/"}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "jessic-schwa", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_r1evaj2", "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_premium": false, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1576947702, "domain": "self.ttcafterloss", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/ttcafterloss/comments/edsadm/my_husband_doesnt_understand_my_grief_and_i_dont/", "gildings": {}, "id": "edsadm", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 9, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/ttcafterloss/comments/edsadm/my_husband_doesnt_understand_my_grief_and_i_dont/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1576947703, "score": 1, "selftext": "It\u2019s been one week since my d&amp;e at 20 weeks.

We\u2019ve been ttc since then with no luck. \n\nThis last month was cycle 6 since the MC. I took a cheap pregnancy test around 11 dpo, and I kind of thought there was like a hint of a hint of a line or more like just some color, but I really couldn\u2019t confirm it, it absolutely could have been nothing. My period came on time with one day of spotting before, and I had really bad cramps (not that unusual for me) and lots of bleeding and blood clots (very unusual.)

The lady said \u201cI am not a medical professional so I can\u2019t tell you what to do, but my advice is you head straight to the ER.\u201d I knew then. We went to the ER and the lack of heartbeat was confirmed. Not three weeks ago, we got the results of our Panorama testing. It was a boy and he was genetically low risk for abnormalities. We had started celebrating. I started moving things around and preparing a space. We started trying our names. \n\nNow I\u2019m in L&amp;D with cytotec. They don\u2019t really want you miscarrying at home at this stage, because of the bleeding.

I am at a complete loss. Everything I see about children living with all the issues that come from having spinabifida makes me feel so sad.

And now I\u2019m back. And a mess, so.. apologies in advance because this is gonna be a long one.\n\nThe issues with my tubes were found to be caused by a ruptured appendix when I was a kid. Scar tissue and adhesions littered my pelvis. Multiple HSG\u2019s and even a laparoscopy with a fertility specialist to try to clear out the adhesions to make the remaining tube functional were fruitless. After the lap, I was told that it is 100% blocked and there wasn\u2019t a chance I could conceive naturally. The doctor left my tube in, saying that it wasn\u2019t causing any harm. Okay, whatevs. That conversation made me think I would never have to come back here.\n\nOn 12/7 I felt weird. Period two days late (not super unusual) but I had a feeling and took a test. Bright ass instantaneous positive. The following Monday I went to my regular OBGYN due to the obviously high risk for ectopic. Lab work came back perfect, but nothing on the ultrasound. Doc wasn\u2019t concerned, it was still early. Two weeks of labs every other day, all of which were textbook perfection. Another ultrasound at the end of the first week, still nothing. I\u2019ll admit I did the thing I know I shouldn\u2019t have. I got my hopes up. This shouldn\u2019t have been happening, this was a miracle in and of itself. This could be THE miracle I\u2019ve been waiting for. I ignored the science that I knew, the information I\u2019ve had for years. And I got hopeful.\n\nAnd then at the end of last week I had another ultrasound, and the pregnancy was found to be in the end of my tube, lodged right up against my ovary. Because my hsg was over 15000 at this point, my doctor wouldn\u2019t give me methotrexate. So they sent me to the hospital across the street for surgery. I sat there for ten hours, they wouldn\u2019t let me eat or drink or have ice chips. I was an add on to their schedule, so I kept getting pushed back due to emergencies. I was a sobbing, uncomfortable mess. I wanted to be home with my husband crying in bed and eating pizza. I was asymptomatic and pissed that they didn\u2019t just put me on the schedule for the next day, which I requested and was told no. When they eventually told me I couldn\u2019t get in until 10 am the following morning, I left. Went home for pizza and husband cuddles and already felt better. \n\nSurgery was okay. I wanted the tube out, because I never wanted to go through this ever again. Turns out my tube, ovaries, and part of my uterus have fused to my abdominal wall from all the scar tissue, so that\u2019s fun. That also means the tube couldn\u2019t be fully removed, but it was closed to avoid this from ever happening in the future. And now, I just wanna get drunk and use a tampon. I\u2019m tired of pads. I\u2019m tired of being sore. I hate being bloated and the pain from the CO2 is 10 times worse than the pain in my abdomen. Counting down the days until this year is over. \n\nIf you\u2019ve managed to read this to completion, you\u2019re a saint.

I wanted to introduce myself and ask a question if that\u2019s ok. TLDR at the end.\n\nI got pregnant via IVF after and FET earlier this month. From the start something felt off. I got a positive FRER relatively late, and had the feeling something was wrong. Had good rising betas, however nothing seen on ultrasound in scans done at 4+5 and 5+2 following some on and off spotting. However, due to good betas, my RE wasn\u2019t to concerned yet. I knew something was wrong but no one seemed to agree.\nFlew across the country to visit family for the holidays. Cue increasing cramps on my right side at 5+4. Nothing really painful, but definitely getting worse. Wanted to avoid going to the ER so I went to a women\u2019s urgent care center where they still couldn\u2019t find anything via ultrasound despite climbing betas.\nAt this point I called my RE who suggested I go to the ER.\nWent to the ER where a great US tech finally located the pregnancy in my right tube. My beta and this point was 5800 so they recommended surgery over methotrexate.\nMy right tube was removed and thankfully I was able to leave the hospital the same day.\nI\u2019m glad this is finally over and I have my answers. I\u2019m mourning my loss but can\u2019t wait to move forward as soon as possible.\n\nMy question is: for those of you who had tube removal following at ectopic, what were your pre-surgery beta levels and how long did it take for them to get back down to zero?\nI took a pregnancy test one day after surgery and it was still a very very strong positive. My RE wants me at zero before we can talk next steps.\n\nTLDR: had my tube removed due to ectopic pregnancy.

The father was my rapist, but that changed nothing. I loved my baby and I still do. \n\nI hadn\u2019t had my period in three years, and I have stomach issues so I live with constant nausea and vomiting. I didn\u2019t know I was pregnant for a while, so prior to finding out I was drinking and smoking. I was hurting my baby and didn\u2019t even know. I also didn\u2019t have health insurance, so once I found out, I struggled to find a free clinic near me. I eventually found one, and the earliest appointment was several weeks away. In the meanwhile, I started to eat better, sleep better, and take prenatal vitamins. I genuinely had no clue how far along I was because the weeks after my assault were tough. I estimated myself to be around 3 months.\n\nA few weeks after finding out I was pregnant, I started bleeding excessively. My baby stopped moving. I just knew I was having a miscarriage, so I shut down. I only left my dorm room to go to class. All I did was sob in my room. A week after I started bleeding, my water broke. I still refused to go to the hospital because I didn\u2019t think they\u2019d let me hold my baby. I was ready to give birth in my dorm.\n\nMy friends eventually convinced me to go to the hospital. I agreed to go once my contractions were closer together. There was a hockey game that night and I told them to go and I\u2019d call if anything happened. I didn\u2019t call, I took an uber to the hospital where they immediately took me to the back. A nurse came in to do an ultrasound and I just kept praying that I was wrong, that my baby would have a heartbeat. My baby did have a heartbeat. My baby was also a girl. She also had gastroschisis.  I was also 23 weeks along, not the 13 weeks that I previously thought I was.\n\nThe doctors then examined me and determined I was too far along in labor to stop it. I gave birth on October 4, 2019 to a beautiful baby girl. I named her Violet. I held her and kissed her forehead and lover her. Holding her, I thought that I could survive this. She later died in my arms. When the nurses took her away, they took me away too. I died right there with her. I couldn\u2019t survive this. My daughter is dead and nothing will bring her back.\n\nOne more week of pregnancy and I would\u2019ve had to file a birth and death certificate. My friends say this would\u2019ve been harder in the long run, but I don\u2019t think so. My baby died with me being the only one who loved her. Atleast if she had a birth certificate, there would be some proof she existed. All I have is her ultrasound, and one photo of her.\n\nViolet was taken away to do genetic testing to see why my body rejected the pregnancy, and why she has gastroschisis. I was delirious and sad and told the nurses I didn\u2019t want the results, but that was lost in translation. That\u2019s Florida for you. I was later called with the results: my baby has Trisomy 13. She was broken before she even had a chance to be whole. She was in pain before she was born. I live with chronic abdominal pain, and this all just feels like a cruel joke. \n\nIt\u2019s been almost 3 months, and there\u2019s been no change to my pain. Everyday feels like a living death. I try to smile and act normal more so I don\u2019t make people feel uncomfortable. My family still doesn\u2019t know what happened.

I was 13 weeks pregnant. I was also very sick and they admitted me for sepsis and pneumonia. I saw baby on the ultrasound with a strong heartbeat. He was kicking and waved at us. As the day went on my cramps got worse. Then they came in waves getting worse and worse. I knew I was in labor but somehow my mind couldn\u2019t actually process it. I went to the bathroom and my baby fell out. I had to push out the placenta. It was traumatic and more heartbreaking than I could have imagined. We were in the \u201csafe\u201d zone. \n\nI was healthy! I\u2019m 30, I carried and delivered a healthy baby over 2 years ago. I eat really well, drink lots of water, exercise, and avoid anything that could potentially harm a baby. \n\nMy mind has been spinning since. What caused it? Was it the sepsis? Did the baby somehow save my life? After all I would not have gone to the ER for my sickness so it could have progressed to a point of true danger. Was it my thyroid antibodies? I\u2019m now on levaquin for my infections and they say severe side effects can show up months after taking it. Side effects are more common in pregnant women. If I were to get pregnant quickly does that increase my risk of these severe side effects?\n\nI\u2019m heartbroken, still super sick, and anxious about all of the above. \n\nMy husband and I talked about waiting until I get my period and then trying again. I know I could technically ovulate in a week or two but it just feels too soon given my other health issues right now. \n\nI\u2019m so frustrated. I was in a due date group and watched so many women ignore the safety advice to avoid lunch meat, alcohol, sushi, etc. I did everything right and I had to suffer this late loss. \n\nHow long did you wait?
