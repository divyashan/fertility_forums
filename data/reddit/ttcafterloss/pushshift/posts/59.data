Setting goals, making plans and acheiving them is like a high for me. After we miscarried I did what I usually do to help me get through. I made a list of what I wanted to accomplish before I was able to get pregnant again. Some were body goals that I couldnt control like stop bleeding, normal hormones and first period. They were more just like a checklist so I could see I was progressing. The other list was goals i could control - lose some weight, buy a bigger bed etc. I miscarried February 5th. Ive since accomplished all of the goals I set. Why do I still feel stuck. Why cant I stop thinking about the baby and feeling sorry for myself? Whats stopping me from moving on?\n\nThen the other day I realized that all of my goals that i set, though the goals were fine, the reason I set those goals was not helping me. Everything was to help us prepare for being pregnant or having a baby -lose weight for a healthier pregnancy, buy a bigger bed to sleep better when pregnant etc etc. Everything i was working towards was still revolving around this baby so every time I got a BFN or something else happened that discouraged me it felt like my whole world was crashing because in a sense thats all I was working towards. \n\nFinally I started to ask myself \"besides baby what else do I want\"? Who do I want to be besides a mom because even when I have this baby I do not want to be defined solely as a mother. I need goals just for me so my whole world doesnt revolve around baby or no baby.\n\nSo what I realized that seems to be helping me and maybe will help you too is that I want to be a whole woman before and after this baby. Other than motherhood what do I want to define me and my life? What can I work at thats just mine because I cant control when the next baby comes and if everything I am is waiting for a baby Im going to keep being miserable about something I have no control over.", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "ttcafterloss", "subreddit_id": "t5_34scd", "subreddit_subscribers": 3307, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "My Revelation", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/ttcafterloss/comments/8jdzxi/my_revelation/"}, {"author": "Chinasun04", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1526327203, "domain": "amandamillswoodlee.wordpress.com", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/ttcafterloss/comments/8jf8ry/beautiful_blog_by_my_friend_who_has_lost_two/", "gilded": 0, "id": "8jf8ry", "is_crosspostable": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_self": false, "is_video": false, "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 0, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/ttcafterloss/comments/8jf8ry/beautiful_blog_by_my_friend_who_has_lost_two/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1526327204, "rte_mode": "markdown", "score": 2, "selftext": "", "send_replies": false, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "ttcafterloss", "subreddit_id": "t5_34scd", "subreddit_subscribers": 3309, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "default", "title": "Beautiful blog by my friend who has lost two", "url": "https://amandamillswoodlee.wordpress.com/2018/05/13/for-the-almost-moms-an-invitation/"}, {"author": "mae_loving_me", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1526328938, "domain": "self.ttcafterloss", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/ttcafterloss/comments/8jfh86/intro/", "gilded": 0, "id": "8jfh86", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_css_class": "intro", "link_flair_richtext": [{"e": "text", "t": "Intro"}], "link_flair_text": "Intro", "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "richtext", "locked": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 6, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/ttcafterloss/comments/8jfh86/intro/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1526328940, "rte_mode": "markdown", "score": 6, "selftext": "Hello, this sub was recommended to me by r/miscarriage, so here I am.

We struggled to get pregnant in the first place and because we both are older (m 39, f 41) the whole pregnancy was a long beautiful but scary time. We were so happy that we made it to the end and was about to have the long-awaited family. My wife is the most perfect mother, I find children to be the meaning of life and have always looked forward to being a father. \n\nWe got married and bought a house, I built a crib and we visited all friends with babies to learn about different ways of being a parent. We were in heaven and 365 days ago we fell down from there to what is best described as limbo, others might call it hell. Unscrewing the baby crib again and putting it in the basement was one of the most difficult things I've endured, but then again those days were just a torrent of \"most difficult thing ever...\".\n\nWe are back to trying again, month after month. We eat medicines, take temperature, stay positive and most importantly try to add love and happiness to our lives. But nothing seems to work and looking around all I hear are sad stories and people trying to comfort us explaining how life without kids is also great, while their toddlers are crawling around their legs... \n\nWhere can I find the 40+ that managed to get pregnant, that have stories with happy endings, that can give us hope and spirit back? I'm starving to be convinced that yes, it will happen...I don't care for realism, I want to believe that it will happen!\n\nAnd no, this is not a throw-away account because I'm proud of what I have gone through and still able to keep my s**t together.

I thought \"Hey, I just went through some terrible shit, I deserve to eat the food I want.\" and in doing so, I have gained about 20 pounds in 7 months. \n\nYears ago I went on a dangerous crash diet involving boxed shakes and nothing else (literally, no other food) for 6 weeks.

Moderation does not work for my body anymore. \n\nMy question is, can I possibly lose the weight I've gained since my loss? I've been told that if you start a strict diet and begin a new exercise routine, your body won't allow a pregnancy because it thinks you're starving/in trouble. Does anyone know if there's truth to this?

I had some brown discharge that started a few days ago at 10+0. It was a bit unsettling, but I had the same thing with my first pregnancy that was pretty much a unicorn pregnancy so I wasn't too worried. At 10+1 we tried to listen for a heartbeat with our home doppler and heard a steady 148. At 10+2 in the morning I suddenly had a bit more discharge and it was pinkish. Still not too bad but I called the hospital. They were very good at calming me down and weren't too worried. Said to come in on Monday (tomorrow) if it stayed the same, but earlier if it got worse. This afternoon there was more. I needed a pad and the discharge was redder. I called the hospital again and they told me to come in. Mainly because I'm rh-. In the car I bled through my pants and the towel I was sitting on just in case. When I took my jeans off in the hospital the floor was covered in blood. That's when I lost all hope. The ultrasound confirmed a miscarriage. The doctor and midwife were amazing and kept emphasizing that it was nothing I did. Still I can't help but think that perhaps it was because I got pregnant on the first post partum ovulation or because it was so close to the previous c-section or even that the home doppler is to blame... They asked me if I wanted misoprostol but that it might not be necessary since my body was taking care of it. I didn't take it. And hopefully I won't need a d&amp;c later on because of my choice.\n\nWe're anxious to try again, but of course have to wait until HPTs are negative again, and preferably one normal cycle after that (but that's mainly for dating reasons, right?) Back to FF and temping it is.

I had minor brown spotting when I peed the Wed-Sat before that, and at one point had reddish mucous discharge, but it was super small and they told me not to worry (we had just had sex, so I assumed it was spotting and discharge). On the 8th, my Beta levels were at 24, and they were down to 13 on Thursday the 10th. They expected them to continue to drop but I didn't ask me to get anymore blood work. \n\nI still haven't passed anything. They said I may pass it, my body may absorb it, or it may pass with my next period. This might sound crazy, but Thursday when I spotted, I didn't \"Feel\" pregnant anymore. I kind of just, knew, I think. After the hospital I cried, for probably a week straight. Then I got angry, like we're talking hulk angry, and I am NOT an angry person, ever. I remember wanting to rip my steering wheel off my car at one point. Then, all of a sudden on Thursday, I just felt like me again. I am not sure if this is a sign that I absorbed it fully, or I am just telling myself this. \n\nSo my question, where do I go from here? I started temping again last week, and they're about 97.1-97.5 (my line is usually around 97.2-97.3). But, I have heard temps are usually crazy after miscarriages. I did an OPK test Thursday and I got a faint line, but nothing major and I dont really want to waste my strips if nothing is going to happen.\nMy cycle is usually 35-40 days, but should I expect it roughly 35 days from the 5-6 week mark of when the baby stopped growing, or from the day I actually pass the miscarriage (which might not even happen?). I am so confused. I just want to actually start TTC again :( \n\nOur dr said we could ttc right away, but recommended waiting a cycle so we had a LKP and if we needed time to heal emotionally.

There were only a few people we told after the fact. From the beginning, we were open about the cause of our loss - most people got a text saying that the baby would make it due to a genetic condition. If people had questions, which we encouraged, we were happy to answer them - I want people to be aware of the variety of genetic tests you can have done in early pregnancy, and I also just wanted people to remember our child and know that it was real and why this happened. We told only our very close friends and our parents about actually making the decision to terminate though. If people asked flat-out if we terminated, I said yes - if anyone had an issue with it (no one did), I would have reconsidered my friendship at the point. However, our friends could not have been more supportive throughout this entire ordeal. We received flowers, notes, fruit arrangements, meals, ice cream, gift cards, etc. Each text and card and delivery made us cry that our friends were this caring and thoughtful, and I'll remember those gestures for the rest of my life. \n\nWhen we told our respective moms about the termination, they had different reactions than our friends. My mom offered to tell the rest of the family and immediately said \"I'll just tell them you had a miscarriage since that's easier.\" I told her not to say that, since that wasn't the narrative - that isn't what happened, but I appreciated her letting the rest of the family know. I asked for her to be informative and provide the trisomy number in case people wanted to do some research. She wound up telling both sides of the family that \"There have been some complications with the pregnancy that indicate she won't be able to carry to term.\" I found this out and was extremely frustrated because that *doesn't even indicate we had a loss* - talk about vague. I gave everything the information and encouraged questions, and basically backtracked a lot of the stuff she told everyone. An annoying thing to deal with while you're also coping with the loss of your child. I thought that this would be the worst reaction we'd have to deal with. However..\n\nThis weekend, we got together with my husband's side of the family for a belated Mother's Day gathering (ugh). My husband's grandmother had a seven-month loss due to chromosomal abnormalities back in the 60s, so she and her husband might be the only people in either of our families who actually know what we're feeling right now. She was also the only person besides a cousin who wished me a happy Mother's Day - neither my mom or MIL acknowledged whatsoever. My husband was talking with her and she said \"We've been thinking about you every day, I wanted to send you a white azalea but MIL had told us we weren't allowed to contact you.\" *screeeeeech* what? Not once did we say this, she just took it upon herself to email all the family members and forbade them to talk to us about the loss. I don't have the actual email so I don't know what was said, but there's not many ways to say \"you can't talk to them\" without actually saying those words. It breaks my heart that there were supportive family members on this side that were too afraid to say anything because my MIL bullied them into not contacting us about our loss. His grandmother was livid so I wouldn't be surprised if this was not the end of it..\n\nFor any future pregnancies, I'm thinking we only tell our friends and wait to tell our families (specifically parents). Can we do that?? It kills me because both of our dads didn't do anything at all and would be so excited about another pregnancy - it feels mean to exclude them but there's no way to keep that a secret from their wives. Has anyone dealt with family just completely bungling their losses and do you have any suggestions on what to do in the future so this doesn't happen again? \n\nTL;DR: Friends have been great, moms have omitted crucial information about our losses and have forbidden family members to talk to us about it. Please help me figure out what to do for any future pregnancy because I'm kind of just thinking I'll let the kid do the announcing to them.

Ended up going to an independent ultrasound place since they were the only ones with availability. We were pretty excited since those places usually do special pictures in 3D and stuff that my normal office doesn\u2019t. Still had my usual symptoms though nausea had decreased, which I had expected (hoped for) since we were entering the second trimester. \n\nWithin moments the tech told us she couldn\u2019t find a heartbeat and was going to call a doctor to review. As our hearts were breaking, several people came in to figure out how to put the doctor on speakerphone in the room, since he wasn't in the office, then left awkwardly. Some complete stranger that I\u2019ve never seen or heard of told us the official news. I called my OB, totally lost as to what to do, and the unhelpful front desk woman had zero sympathy. She said something like, \"oh okay, what do you want to do? I guess you can leave a message with the doctor?\"\n\nWe found out the gender a few weeks ago after NIPT came back clear. I thought we were safe and I feel so stupid about that now. We had just announced to family and friends on Mother\u2019s Day. It took us months to get here and now everything is over after my D&amp;C yesterday. Some of the staff was great, some were shitty. They made me \"describe in my own words\" what the procedure was for. \n\nThe original doctor from the boutique said it looked like it was measuring about a week behind, but it had been measuring progressively ahead for my past few appointments (I'm inherently high risk as a type 1 diabetic and therefore have more frequent appointments). The last ultrasound we had on May 2, I should have been 10+4 but it was measuring 11w. The heart rate was 163 that day. Before that, on 4/27 I would've been 9+6 and it was measuring 10w (only 1 day off) so they let me do the NIPT that day. I feel like the timeline is confusing and just want to know when it happened, even though it won't make any difference or help me feel any better. Was it when I flew out for my business trip? Did it happen before we even announced? \n\nI\u2019m having a really, really hard time processing everything. I just want my little girl.

I am still processing the trauma of my birth experience, and trying to figure out why a healthy, 34 week neonate born at 4 lb 6 oz with APGARs of 7,8, and 9 died the day after her birth. \n\nShort birth story: Went in to the hospital with pre-eclampsia and a BP of 200's/100's, instead of immediately delivering, they put me on mag and induced 24 hours later, when I didn't progress, they broke baby A's water. That didn't move things along, so I finally said to do a C-section because the mag had exhausted me and I couldn't've pushed if I'd been able to. Baby A began having respiratory problems, and soon things spiraled out of control. She died of E.Coli Sepsis. Baby B stayed in the NICU for 3 weeks after that.\n\n6 months later, I got pregnant again, but miscarried at 9 weeks. Perspective is everything, I guess, and the loss settles in on occasion and I realize again what all I've lost. We took a long break from ttc, but are finally ready to try again. The past two years have been the hardest of our lives. Watching our daughter grow is the most joyful torture we could imagine, and I miss her sister every day. \n\nI posted in this sub a long time ago, but there weren't many other mothers who had experienced loss in the same way, or they weren't talking about it.

We did know that he was going to be born with a clubfoot, but we did a lot of research on it and it didn't concern us much. It was just something we would get use to, dealing with the casting stage and then the boots and bar, but no big deal because all the ultrasounds showed that everthing else was fine. Then I started having contractions at 39w and didn't feel my baby move, so we went it thinking it was nothing and he was just in a bad position for me to feel or something, I never could have imagined that something was wrong. He was gone though. I had lost my son. My husband and I were just completely in tears, I remember calling my mom and sobbing to her over the phone. He was her first grandkid, though he was the tenth on my husbands side. I ended up being induced, which was a 40 hour process, and my husband's six siblings (and two of the spouses), his parents, my parents, and my sister stayed in the hospital with us the whole time (some went home at night/others a hotel), a few did end going back to our house and packed all of our baby stuff up so that we didn't have to see it.

I am sorry, this my be painful to read to some of you, but I hope that more and more people become aware of the sad state of laws of some states and insurance coverages that prevent safe care and access to us in our greatest need. \n\nMost of you read my recent story on my anencephaly diagnosis this week. This is what happened next. We decided to go with the D&amp;E option. Until 2 days ago, I was not aware that in December 2017 Texas passed a law that FORBIDS and makes it ILLEGAL for any insurance to cover ANY early terminations of ANY pregnancy even if the baby is completely terminal with the most severe chromosomal or physical deformities. The only way they will cover any such termination is if the mother was dying from a complication.\n\n\u201c The bill, called House Bill 214, prohibits private, state\\-offered, and Affordable Care Act \\(ACA\\) insurance plans in the state of Texas to cover abortion procedures as part of their general coverage. The bill was heavily criticized by abortion rights advocates and Democrats due in part to the fact that the law does NOT offer exceptions for FETAL ABNORMALITIES or for women who are victims of RAPE or INCEST. Abortions for medical emergencies will still be covered\u201d\n\nI was in complete and utter shock and my OB office actually didn't even know about this. They scheduled me for preop and said D&amp;C is approved code on my insurance and I won't have an issue, scheduled me for Tuesday. I had been reading about the law and called the insurance myself asking and they said no it's 100&amp;#37; not covered because D&amp;C on a baby that's still alive is not covered and considered termination. My OB office called me back 30 minutes later with a moment of silence saying that she couldn't believe it herself but when she called to reconfirm it was true. The cash price out of pocket at our hospital with my OB was around $8000. They suggested we go to an abortion clinic instead because who the hell can dish out $8000 for this kind of stuff, hell the pregnancy was going just fine a week ago, we thought. \n\nWhile I am pro choice because I wouldn't ever tell anyone what to do with their body, I have never thought I would end up in an abortion clinic with my only option for medical care. I saw 2 physicians there, one the day before and was not comfortable at all because he said he performs curettage severely to prevent bleeding.... ok guy. And the second one was nice, but she is actually a family practice doctor that does these abortions once a week I am guessing. NEITHER of these options made me feel comfortable with history of miscarriages I really want to prevent more scarring and god forbid more complications. Alas, those were my choices, and I am exhausted, tired, so just defeated, emotionally, physically, I am sad for ALL TFMR women who have ABSOLUTELY NO choice in whom they have for their care to terminate such wanted pregnancies and it's abhorrent to be to think this is OK in 2018. \n\nI will be having my procedure next Wednesday. I am so scared and just hoping it's going to be OK and I just want to bring awareness to the fact that women shouldn't be scared to try to get pregnant and have a chromosomal abnormality that's terminal ... and both the government AND insurance to basically give us a big F U. For what? We are already suffering. It's a sick loophole and I can't believe people signed this in to law. \n\nFor those of you who have been trying or are scared, please research the laws in your state and also your insurance policies because I was not prepared for this. I DID NOT know. Also who the hell is prepared for a terminal diagnosis? \n\nTHE JOKE is that some states allow supplemental \"abortion policies\" for their plans. Like, you'd never think to ask for this or to add it or to even know this is not a benefit to have to TFMR. Oh, we've been trying to have a kid a few years, let us get an abortion policy. WHAT? \n\nBASICALLY. The government has made sure that women can't terminate even in this case unless they can fork out a bunch of cash. AND they closed all the abortion clinics that can even perform this. So What's next?? You will never be able to TFMR because you'll have to either pay cash for this to your OB/Hospital and loose 10k per pregnancy on TFMR OR have to fly somewhere else ... OR be forced to carry it to term.... for what? \n\nI just hope that you guys spread the knowledge, if you live in Texas, please write to the government, and please vote blue. I have been a republican ALL MY LIFE until 3 days ago. I will NEVER vote red again. This has changed my whole perspective of how government is going to control women's bodies forever. \n\nAgain, I am so so sorry for all of us who have suffered. SUFFERED ENOUGH.

I am sorry, this my be painful to read to some of you, but I hope that more and more people become aware of the sad state of laws of some states and insurance coverages that prevent safe care and access to us in our greatest need.\n\nMost of you read my recent story on my anencephaly diagnosis this week. This is what happened next. We decided to go with the D&amp;E option. Until 2 days ago, I was not aware that in December 2017 Texas passed a law that FORBIDS and makes it ILLEGAL for any insurance to cover ANY early terminations of ANY pregnancy even if the baby is completely terminal with the most severe chromosomal or physical deformities. The only way they will cover any such termination is if the mother was dying from a complication.\n\n\u201c The bill, called House Bill 214, prohibits private, state\\-offered, and Affordable Care Act \\(ACA\\) insurance plans in the state of Texas to cover abort!n procedures as part of their general coverage. The bill was heavily criticized by abort!n rights advocates and Democrats due in part to the fact that the law does NOT offer exceptions for FETAL ABNORMALITIES or for women who are victims of RAPE or INCEST. Abort!ns for medical emergencies will still be covered\u201d\n\nI was in complete and utter shock and my OB office actually didn't even know about this. They scheduled me for preop and said D&amp;C is approved code on my insurance and I won't have an issue, scheduled me for Tuesday. I had been reading about the law and called the insurance myself asking and they said no it's 100&amp;#37; not covered because D&amp;C on a baby that's still alive is not covered and considered termination. My OB office called me back 30 minutes later with a moment of silence saying that she couldn't believe it herself but when she called to reconfirm it was true. The cash price out of pocket at our hospital with my OB was around $8000. They suggested we go to an abort!n clinic instead because who the hell can dish out $8000 for this kind of stuff, hell the pregnancy was going just fine a week ago, we thought.\n\nWhile I am pro choice because I wouldn't ever tell anyone what to do with their body, I have never thought I would end up in an abort!n clinic with my only option for medical care. I saw 2 physicians there, one the day before and was not comfortable at all because he said he performs curettage severely to prevent bleeding.... ok guy. And the second one was nice, but she is actually a family practice doctor that does these procedures once a week I am guessing. NEITHER of these options made me feel comfortable with history of miscarriages I really want to prevent more scarring and god forbid more complications. Alas, those were my choices, and I am exhausted, tired, so just defeated, emotionally, physically, I am sad for ALL TFMR women who have ABSOLUTELY NO choice in whom they have for their care to terminate such wanted pregnancies and it's abhorrent to be to think this is OK in 2018.\n\nI will be having my procedure next Wednesday. I am so scared and just hoping it's going to be OK and I just want to bring awareness to the fact that women shouldn't be scared to try to get pregnant and have a chromosomal abnormality that's terminal ... and both the government AND insurance to basically give us a big F U. For what? We are already suffering. It's a sick loophole and I can't believe people signed this in to law.\n\nFor those of you who have been trying or are scared, please research the laws in your state and also your insurance policies because I was not prepared for this. I DID NOT know. Also who the hell is prepared for a terminal diagnosis?\n\nTHE JOKE is that some states allow supplemental \"abort!n policies\" for their plans. Like, you'd never think to ask for this or to add it or to even know this is not a benefit to have to TFMR. Oh, we've been trying to have a kid a few years, let us get an abort!n policy. WHAT?\n\nBASICALLY. The government has made sure that women can't terminate even in this case unless they can fork out a bunch of cash. AND they closed all the abort!n clinics that can even perform this. So What's next?? You will never be able to TFMR because you'll have to either pay cash for this to your OB/Hospital and loose 10k per pregnancy on TFMR OR have to fly somewhere else ... OR be forced to carry it to term.... for what?\n\nI just hope that you guys spread the knowledge, if you live in Texas, please write to the government, and please vote blue. I have been a republican ALL MY LIFE until 3 days ago. I will NEVER vote red again. This has changed my whole perspective of how government is going to control women's bodies forever.\n\nAgain, I am so so sorry for all of us who have suffered. SUFFERED ENOUGH. I really feel like we shouldn't have to suffer in all other sort of way and have to worry about ALL THIS SHIT when all we can think about is \\- are my betas doubling, omg is it going to be ectopic. Just no. I feel for all of you ladies.\n\nYou have to call your insurance and check the benefits basically \\- if it's based somewhere else OTHER than your state that has these laws, you may still have coverage. For example, people that work and live in TX may have like Blue Cross Blue Shield of California \\(IDK just example\\) but since Cali is pro this they will still cover it. The opposite is also true. If you have a Texas plan and you want to travel outside of TX to see if this procedure is covered in California \\- it will not be. Your plan will follow you. \n\nEdit: for title and !! to get rid of trolls", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "ttcafterloss", "subreddit_id": "t5_34scd", "subreddit_subscribers": 3343, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Texas and other states deny insurance coverage care for TFMR, as they did with me and my diagnosis of anencephaly with my baby.

I\u2019m looking for some advice about follow up care after a loss. \n\nI went through a miscarriage at 10 weeks (mmc, baby had died at 7) it took about a week to pass everything, though a few days after that my pregnancy test was still positive, though much lighter. I didn\u2019t take another one, as I was no longer bleeding at all and was in no discomfort, I figured things would finish up on their own. \n\nFast forward 2 weeks, I have an appointment with a new obgyn, and she has me do a urine pregnancy test in office to make sure it\u2019s totally negative. It is. \n\nFor the following couple of days I\u2019m spotting. (Yesterday and today) my first thought is that maybe I\u2019m starting to ovulate again, it seems too early for a period, and mid cycle spotting isn\u2019t unheard of for me. \n\nToday, I\u2019m still spotting, so I took a pregnancy test on a wild whim, and it came back just faintly positive. Not much, but not nothing. \n\nHere\u2019s the question part. Is it possible that my test is just more sensitive than the one used at the doctors office, and there is still something retained in there? 2 weeks after the completion of a miscarriage seems WAY too early for another pregnancy. I\u2019ll call the doctor on Tuesday when they open, but I\u2019m curious if anyone else has still had a positive test this far out, especially after a negative at the doctors office. \n\nSo far I\u2019ve done everything without medical intervention, and I\u2019m a little worried about what\u2019s going to happen. If I\u2019ve retained tissue, will I need a d&amp;c?

Two days later I had severe cramping and bleeding and was determined I miscarried at 5/6 weeks.\r\n\r\nMaybe it's bc I just paid the final bill from the miscarriage doctor visits, or bc we're in the middle of my fertile week now and ttc again, but I Cannot. Stop. Crying.\r\n\r\nMy husband is so loving and supportive, but I feel like he isn't processing it as a loss (1)bc his body didn't feel the excruciating pain of regecting pregnancy (and his hormones are going haywire), (2)he is so damn rational about everything and doesn't show sad emotions well. I know it was just a clump of cells (he kept repeating) but it still feels very much like a loss of life to me. He is his own person and processes emotion different than me, but why am I still so ****ing sad about this and he is fine!\r\n\r\nI have a great relationship with my mom but haven't told her any of this and it's killing me. I just know there's 100% chance anything I tell her won't be kept a secret. She can't help but talk about life (good and bad) to anyone that will listen, and I'm feeling very sensitive to this and it's no one else's business to know and judge. Im not looking for pitty from family, friends or strangers, I just need to tell my story to help me heal emotionally. \r\n\r\nSo thank you, people of the internet, for listening and letting me anonymously grieve and heal.
