Happy Friday everyone!\n\nI read the sidebar and I didn't see anything about what information you want exactly, but I'm 31/F and my husband is 31/M.\n\nIt's so weird to be posting here.  I told myself I would never get wrapped up in the TTC culture again after what I went through before, but I've heard such amazing things about this sub from other parts of Reddit, so I'll give it a chance!\n\nI lost my first pregnancy a year ago next week.  I was 12 weeks along and had had a great 8 week scan that put my mind at ease.  I went to my NT scan and learned the bad news from a doctor I had never met.\n\nWe tried again right away and I had a CP two months later.  It was then that my (now former) OB told me that I needed to wait at least three months to try again.  This news devastated me, but it ended up being very good for me.  I was having a really tough time dealing with the first loss as it was, and seemingly all of my friends were announcing their pregnancies and babies were being born.  I just needed to get away from the TTC and loss cycle for a while and clear my head.\n\nDuring that time I was pretty convinced that I didn't even want to try again.  I was already on the fence about having a child to begin with, and TTC was making me really anxious and a different person.  I wanted to continue living the life that I had before I fell pregnant the first time - oblivious to fertility issues and content.  My husband has been supportive of my decision although I know he wants a child.  I have struggled with that knowledge intensely and spent a long time trying to convince myself to try again while also trying to discuss the issue with him and lay out all of my trepidations about parenthood.  Our discussions almost always ended with \"You don't want to do it, so we aren't doing it.\"  It was very difficult to get an actual discussion going.\n\nWell, I recently switched to a new insurance provider and now I have an OB who actually cares about my history of loss.  She tested me for some things and I came back with one MTHFR gene mutation.  She said I am heterozygous.  \n\nI hope this is not a trigger for anyone, but in doing research I started down the rabbit hole and came up with a theory for my first loss.  I know it's probably not smart to speculate, but it's difficult not to, especially armed with this new knowledge.\n\nBasically, from what I understand, I have a difficult time processing folic acid, and taking it as a supplement is actually bad for people with this mutation (which evidently affects something like 40% of the population).  When I got pregnant the first time, I immediately started taking New Chapter prenatals, which contain folate, not folic acid.  At my 8 week scan, I asked me OB what I should be taking as I was thinking about making a switch.  He told me it absolutely did not matter as long as I was getting folic acid.  I switched to a popular drugstore brand that contained high amounts of folic acid.  Based on the measurements of the fetus at the NT scan, I had to have lost it shortly after I made that switch.  I was still taking those high folic acid prenatals when I had the CP.\n\nNow, I know that this could all be coincidence and that I'm still at risk for MC even with the changes I have made (I started taking a methylfolate supplement in addition to the prenatals with folate in them), but this gave me a renewed hope and made me feel optimistic about trying again.  I have really warmed up to the idea of trying again, and now we're aiming to try starting with my next cycle (I just finished ovulating this cycle, during which we have prevented).\n\nMy husband and I have also both been taking high doses of ubiquinol (CoQ10) since February to improve egg and sperm quality.\n\nThis is getting obscenely long, so I'll stop here.  Thank you for reading and I wish everyone the best of luck in their journeys!\n\nP.S. - I was delighted to see rule 6 in the sidebar. :)  I think I love you guys already!!", "stickied": false, "subreddit": "ttcafterloss", "subreddit_id": "t5_34scd", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Intro post.

Immediately headed to the bedroom. My husband was out of town for the next 4 days. Wasn't really tracking so we kept trying every other day.  2.5 weeks later got a BFP. Went to the doctor and was told I was due about 6 days later than I thought. Ok, 6 days, not a big deal. Except it stuck with me, always in the back of my mind was that isn't right.

I learned about this sub from the ladies over at r/CautiousBB and figured I'd come over and do an intro since I'm really hoping to be actively involved over here. My husband and I learned on Friday at our 12 week ultrasound that the fetus stopped growing at 7 weeks and had no heartbeat. I miscarried naturally over this weekend (worst pain of my life, good lord!) and the bleeding/cramping/contractions seem to finally be settling down. (It wasn't my plan to go natural - I wanted the D&amp;C - but my body moved too fast.)  \n  \nWe're both 34 years old and I'm not gonna lie: I'm so scared that I'm too old to conceive again. We got pregnant on the third cycle the first time around (and it was the first cycle where we used the OPKs correctly.) Emotionally we're both handling this really well and we both want to try again as soon as possible, both because we really want a baby and because I'll be 35 so soon. I'll be going in to see my midwife for blood work on Wednesday and I'm hoping my hcg levels will have gone down significantly (maybe even to 0). \n  \nSo, if my hcg goes back to 0, is it safe for us to start trying? I know we'll probably wait one cycle, but I cannot imagine dealing with condoms for the next month! (I had an IUD for the last 8 years so condoms aren't really a part of our sexy times :P) I'd really love to hear from other ladies about their experiences trying soon after a natural miscarriage (no D&amp;C / cytotec). Is not-trying-not-preventing a really irresponsible idea?  \n  \nWhile I'm not happy for the reason I'm joining you all, I AM glad that this place exists and I look forward to learning from and sharing with you all.

I'm sorry I don't have the energy to individually respond to you all.  Its 10am and I have made it out of bed. First thing I did was make an appointment with my OB as I have little faith in the GPs. I have also been able to request a psychologist referral.\nShortly after making this I began to miscarry.\nI have not yet heard from my GP, but I will have to call them as I need a medical certificate - I won't be going in to work tonight.\nI am shaking, but a little more to terms with it.  Although I have been very anxious throughout and could not see ahead of each day, I didn't actually expect this to happen.\n\nI can not imaging how I would have felt if I had not contacted the nurse yesterday to find my HCG was dropping - I would have been miscarrying on the way home from work or worse at work.  This is a new experience for me as my last one was a D&amp;C at 9 weeks.  I am guessing since it is so early there shouldn't be any complications.\n\nI am really pissed off at the GP.\n\nThank you again for all the love.\n\nEdit: so I called my GP and *she hasn't even checked my blood results yet*. She was in yesterday, but obviously didn't check them, even though I called and the nurse was aware they had dropped.  So much for keeping a very close eye on things for me.  I have asked them to get her to call me back when she gets in at 1445.\n\nEdit 2: so got back from the GP, they insisted I come in and see a different GP as the original one was busy, but that I was also going to get a call from the original GP.  Never got the call, but when I got there and they realised that I was booked with an 8month pregnant GP I was switched back to the original. \n\nAnd the story changes.  She now tells me that she was holding off calling me with the dropping HCG numbers as she wanted to see if I would bleed first, she thought if I got them before bleeding I would worry.  *ummm* if you had rung me with them I would have known what was happening and been prepared.  You're not to know the nurse slipped up in giving me the numbers, but I'm so glad she did.

I've now split from my fianc\u00e9e. \n\nI'm not coping. AT ALL. I haven't even processed my second miscarriage. We're still living together (we're both moving in two weeks) and every time I see him I cry. All over him.  I'm barely coping. He's my best friend and has been for seven years. We've spoken nearly every day for nine years. The thought that by the end of the month i won't be seeing him every day or talking to him is like a stab in the gut. But I need to as he doesn't love my romantically anymore and I deserve that. But I'm dying at that thought. I honestly feel like I'll die without him. (I am NOT suicidal) I'm in my 30s and he was my first serious relationship so this is my first break up. \n\nHis parents are here overnight tomorrow and it's going to be horrific. I put a fair amount of blame on them for this because it all started happening once we moved in and they got in his ear. First six months he'd take my side whenever there were issues (and they were always having issues with me) Then it became 'I don't want to be in the middle anymore' and that's the time he started having issues. And I'm so angry at him for that. Because I deserved to be alerted that there were issues before his fucking parents. And I deserved to hear of it before I told him I thought I was pregnant the second time only to be met with the response 'well I guess I'm stuck with you now' I deserve someone who will fight for me and it breaks me it's not him. \n\nTo top it all off I finally got my period today, first time since the miscarriage. And I'm destroyed. Because last week I was having symptoms that were so similar to my other pregnancies and there was that hope. And while logically I know it's for the best not to be tied to him, emotionally I wanted his baby. It's also now two weeks since my original baby was due. I want a baby so badly and now I know it's a long way off, if ever. \n\nI alternate between wishing this was a nightmare (though after all this I won't take him back) to hating him to hating that I hate him. I feel so pathetic and broken right now. And the actual nightmares I'm having are making me wake up crying. \n\nI just need to talk and I'm going nuts.

I wasn't sure where to post this and figured you guys could give some great advice. \n\nMy BFF found out that she was (unexpectedly) pregnant in the beginning of December, the father being not the greatest guy. At that time, I was also announcing that I was engaged. \n\nAround 20 weeks, she found out that her son will likely not live to birth. He has a lot of malformed organs though they cannot figure out genetically *why* this is happening. As it is, I have been planning a wedding with my HS sweetheart while she is trying to not get attached to her in-utero son. I didn't even know what to say, but have been trying to be there for her as best as I can (she is a very private person, even with me). She says she \"doesn't mind talking about it\", though.\n\nVery recently I was also diagnosed with endometriosis, and upon talking extensively with the doctor, my husband-to-be and I decided to start TTC. Although my BFF has told me that she wants to try for kids again in the future (even as early as next year), I feel like my whole wedding + TTC journey is not helping with everything going on with her.\n\nVery soon, they will be setting a date to induce her. Like I said -- her son will likely not live to birth, and if he does, it will be a poor quality of life e.g. a respirator, feeding tube, etc. and it wouldn't be for very long.\n\nMy heart has been absolutely breaking for her. I haven't known what to say the whole time that this has been going on, though I know there isn't really anything *to* say. I know she is trying hard to be excited for me (I did inform her that we were going to be TTC) but I can tell she is really struggling. She'll be at my wedding in less than two weeks, 7 months pregnant with a baby she'll likely not keep, fielding awkward questions, all to be there for *me*.\n\nI pray for a miracle for her every day.\n\nHow do I help her? How do I be a good friend to her in this time of need?

Hubby and I started TTC May 1st of this year. I've had issues with super long cycles due to PCOS and was put on metformin 2000mg a day back in March which seemed to cut my 35+ day cycles to an average 28 days for both March and April. Then May hit and we started actively trying.  My OB ordered a standing order of progesterone for my day21. I did it in May and it came back a measly 3. Meaning I had not ovulated. I was upset because having never gotten a + OPK even tho we weren't yet TTC I had been monitoring it under the suspicion I may not be ovulating. I wrote off May as an anovulatory month and hoped for better for June. \n\nThen before I knew it I was back to a super long cycle by the end of May AF still hadn't come and finally on Sunday (June 8th I took a preg test to rule it out and it was a faint but very there positive). My hubby and I were elated but wanted to be sure as I knew I must have ovulated VERY late. Like.. After Day24 of my cycle. Had my first HCG level done Monday and it came back a measly 15. Still hopeful though. \n\nI took a whole bunch of HCG pee tests on Tuesday because the line seemed lighter and my sore breasts had seemed to settle down. I had to wait another 24 hours before my next HCG draw. Finally Wednesday came and I went to the lab and got my blood drawn again. In the meantime at work I noticed a very slight amount of pink tinged mucous when I wiped. I knew it wasn't going to stick then but the second HCG level came back a 9 and I knew for sure. Later on in the evening my cramps got pretty unbearable  and I started spotting more. Today I haven't been able to leave my apartment because it feels like the heaviest, crampiest period I've ever had. \n\nOn one hand I'm happy because at least I know I can get pregnant, but I'm worried because I ovulated so late this might be an indicator I may have viability issues. \n\nI'm counting today at CD2 and hoping my cycle regulates enough again that I ovulate within a normal time. \n\nHas anyone had any successful late ovulation pregnancies?\n\nSending love to all those out there reading this experiencing similar situations.
