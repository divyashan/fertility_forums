I am in a better place now, and looking forward to being part of the community again.\n\nIn the past couple months, I have started seeing an RE.  I like him a lot--he is personable, happy to answer questions, and has mostly very positive reviews.  So far, we have done lots of blood tests, an SHG, and an endometrial biopsy.  The first two didn't show anything of note, but the endometrial biopsy showed that the endometrium was out of phase with my menstrual cycle, which means I have a luteal phase defect.  This makes sense to me, because with both of my miscarriages my progesterone was low.  The RE prescribed femara for me to start next cycle, and I came away from the conversation feeling relieved to have a diagnosis and a plan.\n\nHowever, when I began to research, I found many sites that said the endometrial biopsy is an outdated an ineffective way to diagnose luteal phase defect.  This is making me nervous that:\na) Maybe the diagnosis is incorrect and\nb) Maybe I should not trust my RE if he is performing outdated procedures.\n\nI was wondering if you all could share your experiences with endometrial biopsies.  Are they still commonly performed?  If you had one and were diagnosed with luteal phase defect, were you prescribed femara?  If so, what has your experience with femara been like?  Do you think this is a big red flag?\n\nThanks so much for your help, and hope you all have a great day.\n\n", "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "ttcafterloss", "subreddit_id": "t5_34scd", "suggested_sort": null, "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Endometrial Biopsy--Outdated?", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/ttcafterloss/comments/6d9tpj/endometrial_biopsyoutdated/"}, {"author": "BabyCalebsMommy", "author_created_utc": 1469849145, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_text": null, "author_fullname": "t2_zy2k0", "brand_safe": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1495721294, "domain": "self.ttcafterloss", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/ttcafterloss/comments/6d9tu3/our_friends_with_close_due_date_to_us_just_had_a/", "gilded": 0, "id": "6d9tu3", "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "locked": false, "media_embed": {}, "num_comments": 29, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/ttcafterloss/comments/6d9tu3/our_friends_with_close_due_date_to_us_just_had_a/", "retrieved_on": 1497178480, "score": 12, "secure_media_embed": {}, "selftext": "A couple who is close to me and my husband found out they were pregnant with their second around the same time as we found out we were also pregnant with our second.

They had been closely monitored ever since, but it wasn\u2019t looking good. Over this past weekend they told us that she had been in and out of the hospital for monitoring and that there was a good chance the baby wouldn\u2019t make it through the weekend.

But I am wondering if we should reply to the text giving our condolences and offer any assistance they may need or just to not reply at all.

After we found out they were having complications I didn\u2019t bring up the topic of pregnancy or talk about my pregnancy around them unless they brought it up themselves. When they were pregnant with their first I was also pregnant, but I had a miscarriage. While it is nowhere close to the pain of a stillbirth, I still was upset and jealous for a while that they were having a healthy baby and I had lost mine.

My husband has sperm issues including low but not awful sperm count, and low motility. At my first ultrasound around 5+6 weeks the heart rate was very low at 76, second ultrasound a week later showed it at 83 but with growth. Final ultrasound at 8 weeks showed no heart beat and no growth. \n\nI had a D&amp;C then and there because I didn't want to wait for it to pass on it's own. Well, the RE informed me after that they couldn't get it all, and that it would probably pass on its own after a day or two. I went in 3 days later and ultrasound confirmed nothing passed. I was given misoprostol and holy heck did it work well; last ultrasound showed a clear uterus, yay. \n\nI'm still bleeding (9 days post D&amp;C, 6 days post misoprostol). My cervix is still open and very very low (like two inches from my vaginal opening) and I can feel around the outside of my uterus, which feels hard and cone shaped. My RE mentioned that it was normal, though I haven't been able to find any information online about it. I express my concern, hoping it's not a vaginal prolapse but she kind of laughed at me. \n\nSo here we are. Just waiting for my cervix to rise and stop bleeding before I can even feel remotely normal again. This is my third loss (although the first two were very early, 4-5 weeks-ish) and I I want to do another IUI but I'm terrified of this happening again. The tissue taken from the procedure has been sent for pathology/histology so we're waiting to hear about that. \n\nI'm happy someone else told me about this community. I can't talk to any of my friends about this as only one of them has had a healthy baby her first month trying, the rest are not at that stage in their lives. My father has just been diagnosed with lung cancer and I do not want to burden my family with this at this time. So, it's only me, my husband and you guys.

Anyone have any experience with these?\n\n\n**Long version -**\n\nI'm 25, pretty healthy overall, and my husband (25M) and I have been trying to have a baby for about 18 months. In that time, we've lost six babies in the first trimester. First miscarriage was last April at 10 weeks (missed miscarriage), then we had three between 4 and 5 weeks, then in December another at 6 weeks, and the most recent this May at 7 weeks. Needless to say, we're not having trouble conceiving!\n\nWe've had a lot of testing since the first miscarriage. Things we have discovered: subclinical hypothyroidism, high-end-of-normal fasting insulin levels, high-end-of-normal pro-lactin levels (though this was right after miscarrying, which can drive the levels up), and high-end-of-normal testosterone.\n\nI was placed on thyroid medication, which I think has been great for my overall health. Also started taking metformin about 6 months ago. It seems to have improved my testosterone levels and it's made it easier to lose weight (although I have always been in the \"healthy\" range for my height). I've also had progesterone support for all but the first pregnancy - though it's not clear that it's doing anything since my first pregnancy without it was the longest.\n\nWe've also had a lot of dead ends while testing. Things I don't seem to have: PCOS, autoimmune issues, adrenal issues, Prothrombin Factor II, Factor V Leiden.\n\nWe weren't able to get chromosomal information for the first five miscarriages, but we're hoping to get info for this sixth baby. I've had ultrasounds to check for structural abnormalities, but my understanding is that not all issues can be detected this way.\n\nMy husband and I are currently both on a course of antibiotics in case an endometrial infection is causing these problems. My doctor said that this diagnosis is hard to make since it requires a biopsy of the endometrium and then culturing the bacteria, which is tough if the bacteria is slow growing. After this course of antibiotics, I'll have a hysteroscopy to check for structural abnormalities in the uterus and we'll also do a biopsy.\n\nI'm also having a lot more tests for blood clotting issues. We're also going to be talking to a rheumatologist. It currently looks like I'll be placed on Lovenox/heparin even if the tests are negative, based on previous pregnancy loss and family history.

I thought it was time to share my story. \n\nI'm 32 years old and decided with my partner that we wanted to have a baby late last year. We got pregnant quickly and felt very lucky. My pregnancy wasn't easy, but it wasn't too bad either. I was very tired and nauseous, but had been feeling better since the end of my first trimester. I got monthly ultrasounds for no particular reason (just the done thing around here) and everything looked great. I received good results from the NIPT as well and had scheduled an anatomy scan, but was told I could start feeling good about the pregnancy. Until then, I had been pretty detached. That's my nature and I'm also a scientist who knows a little too much about these things and I was acutely aware of the risks of something going wrong. \n\nAt 18 weeks, I had a routine ultrasound and something was clearly wrong. A series of follow up scans confirmed that the foetus was not going to survive much longer. I immediately stated my choice to electively terminate, but was advised to remain pregnant for as long as possible (until the foetus died) because I had a low placenta and could expect complications when induced into labour. Waiting gave a chance of my placenta moving, but this was a difficult period as I stopped feeling any movement and was constantly wondering whether our baby was still alive.\n\nA little over two weeks later (20+2), the decision was finally made to induce labour for a stillbirth. The first round of medication went ok and I was responding well, but on the second round, things escalated way too quickly. I had very strong contractions with the need to push, but my placenta started coming first, which resulted in too much bleeding. My doctors took the decision to get me into surgery for a D&amp;E, where everything went well, but I lost more blood. \n\nRecovery has been hard. I have been terribly tired because of the blood loss. My milk came in, which was upsetting, though it's stopped now after some medication. And I've had waves of hormone-induced emotions that make me desperately sad, which I didn't expect. I'm getting better but it's going to be a while still. My partner has way exceeded my expectations and I feel so lucky to have him around... though also terrified something will happen every time he walks out the door.\n\nPart of me wants to be pregnant again as soon as possible. The other part is terrified this may happen again. None of the tests have revealed anything to explain what went wrong. That could be good in the sense that it was a random event, or it could mean there is something lurking in our genes. \n\nAnd that's my story. I wish this community didn't exist but I'm awfully glad it does. I will probably start posting on the TTC thread when my cycle normalizes and I work out whether I'm ready to try again... so see you there.

Due to our long training schedules we have put off having kids for years, but last fall decided it was time to start trying as we are in a decent place financially.  We were NTNP for a few months without much luck, and then I wised up and started temp tracking, using OPKs, etc.  2 months later, I was pregnant!  It was wonderful.  We were so happy.  Baby's due date was around Thanksgiving.\n\nI had my 8 week appointment with my OB and was told everything was fine.  A week later I went in for my dating U/S (by myself, as hubby was working) and that's when everything fell apart. The tech didn't say a word to me during the scan, and had the screen turned away from me the entire time so I couldn't see what was going on.  The mood in the room was...cold.  During the scan I was trying to remind myself that techs aren't really allowed to say much, but I thought that surely she would say *something*, maybe \"There's the baby!\" or something vague like that.  Instead, after 20 minutes of probing around my vagina, she abruptly pulled out the wand and said she needed to go talk to the radiologist.  I got dressed and sat in the chair, feeling slightly sick.  After a good 15 minutes, the tech came back in and said that a physician from my doctor's office was on the phone and wanted to talk to me.  My stomach sank even further.  I knew it wasn't going to be good news if they had called my doctor in the middle of my appointment.\n\nThe doctor I spoke to informed me brusquely that there was nothing on the ultrasound but a large number of cysts in the placenta.  \"It's probably a molar pregnancy,\" he said, \"and we need to take it out immediately.\"  \n\n\"You're joking,\" I said.  I honestly couldn't believe what I was hearing.  Of course I had read about molar pregnancies way back in medical school, and knew there was some association with cancer, but that's all I could recall in that moment.  Now dazed, I half-listened while the doc gave me some instructions for drawing an HCG level and setting up my D&amp;C. Before leaving the exam room, I called my poor husband, who was in clinic with his own patients, and broke the news.  \"It's a molar pregnancy,\" I managed to choke out.  \"There's no baby.\"  He didn't respond for a second, then said, \"Honey, I'm so sorry.\"\n\nThe rest of that day was a blur.  I did my preop stuff and drove home, crying the whole way.  When my husband got home he too burst into tears and we cried together for a long time.  I don't think even he had realized until that day just how attached we were to the pregnancy.  \n\nI guess I will mention at this point that I am a pediatrician.  As luck would have it, I was on call the next day and had to go to the hospital in the morning and round on the newborns.  That was pretty rough, knowing that my own pregnancy was about to end while having to smile and congratulate the new moms, and examine their babies, and talk about baby topics like breastfeeding.  I somehow managed to stumble through the day without crying in front of any patients or my colleagues, but inside I felt numb.\n\nI had my D&amp;C the next day, which went as well as could be expected.  Again, as luck would have it, I was scheduled to be on vacation the following week and so had a good few days alone to heal after the procedure.  Even with a week off to brace myself, the first few days back at work were not easy.  I love working with kids, but after losing my own very much wanted pregnancy, I felt like I was in a never-ending nightmare.\n\nMy path results returned 2 weeks after the surgery and I was relieved to find out that it was not a molar pregnancy after all, just a blighted ovum/MMC.  My period returned 29 days after the D&amp;C (and holy heavy bleeding Batman!).  I had my postop visit with my OB and my HCG was negative. My doctor gave me the all-clear to start trying again.\n\nSo, here I am, a few days into my first cycle after my miscarriage.  I am feeling slightly better about the whole thing but I know my outlook on pregnancy has been irreparably changed.  We are going to start trying again this month and while I am hopeful we will conceive again, I know that seeing that second line on an HPT is going to bring on a lot of anxiety and fear, rather than just joy and excitement as it did last time.\n\nI want to say that I am incredibly grateful to you ladies for sharing your stories on this forum.  It has been very comforting to me to know that there are plenty of women out there who have experienced pregnancy loss, and that my own experience isn't so different from the hundreds of other stories I've devoured over the past month.  Although I'm mostly a lurker, this page has been so helpful in helping me heal emotionally.  \n\nBest of luck to you all as your continue through your TTC journey.  \n\n      ", "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "ttcafterloss", "subreddit_id": "t5_34scd", "suggested_sort": null, "thumbnail": "self", "title": "coming out of lurkerdom...", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/ttcafterloss/comments/6e0xuu/coming_out_of_lurkerdom/"}, {"author": "daenerystagaryen", "author_created_utc": 1353538287, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_text": null, "author_fullname": "t2_9o9po", "brand_safe": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1496074534, "domain": "self.ttcafterloss", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/ttcafterloss/comments/6e15cf/opk_advice/", "gilded": 0, "id": "6e15cf", "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "locked": false, "media_embed": {}, "num_comments": 3, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/ttcafterloss/comments/6e15cf/opk_advice/", "retrieved_on": 1497192156, "score": 5, "secure_media_embed": {}, "selftext": "How soon after a loss should I wait to start using ovulation predictor tests?

My HCG on May 8 was 82 and 87 on May 10, and I was told to keep taking home pregnancy tests until they were no longer positive. They initially said it was a chemical pregnancy. After continued positive pregnancy tests (that were turning positive fast), I demanded that they do blood work to see exactly where my HCG levels were. That lab draw came back at 400, which is over 4x the levels drawn on May 8 and 10. Obviously, still not doubling or tripling and not at all measuring where they should be at 7 weeks.\n\nThey called to tell me that there was a possibility of an ectopic pregnancy and that they wanted to continue to monitor. I took that information, and then began thinking about the back pain and abdominal pain I had over the last few days and became concerned. It was already after 5 and I started really spinning into a lot of anxiety about ectopic pregnancies, rupture, and future fertility.\n\nWe ended up going almost immediately to the ER and I had bloodwork and a transvaginal ultrasound. My HCG levels had dropped since the morning into the 300's. The ultrasound found a 3mm sac in my uterus with nothing inside. They also found a 2.6cm cyst on my ovary. They said my lining was thin at 6mm. They didn't see evidence of an ectopic pregnancy or any complications in the tubes at the ER.\n\nI went in for followup bloodwork two days later and my HCG was 427. My OB's office called and told me to drive to the cancer center an hour away and get methotrexate, as \"the possibility of an ectopic is great\". So I did.\n\nNow, 3 days out I feel awful- metallic taste in my mouth, nausea, abdominal pains, and constipation. When do these symptoms let up? What should I expect? I haven't started bleeding yet. I did the 4 day labs, and they were 480-- I know that its common for them to rise. We are supposed to go out of town on the weekend (beginning on day 7). Is that a mistake? Am I going to feel worse?\n\nAlso, what is up with the sac in my uterus? It measured 4-5 weeks which matched the HCG levels. Is it possible it was on its way to being a missed miscarriage (if we hadn't been monitoring?) I'm confused about the diagnosis with no ultrasound proof. I know that the pregnancy was not viable, as I was tracking closely and supposed to be 7-7.5 weeks, but my question is really about the HCG levels and presence of the \"gestational sac\".", "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "ttcafterloss", "subreddit_id": "t5_34scd", "suggested_sort": null, "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Ectopic Pregnancy?

I'm 26, in a serious committed relationship with an amazing man. My first pregnancy was after our third month of NTNP.  I'm just about to finish my first period after having miscarried something between February and April, and just about to start getting back into TTC. \n\nSO here's my story:\n \nI found out I was pregnant at the very end of January. I decided to take a test because my boobs had been hurting and I was spotting a lot longer and sooner than I usually do before a period. I was spotting and I never really stopped. I went into the ER and my OB a few times, my HCG kept going up but I kept bleeding. A few ultrasounds later my OB confirmed it was not a viable pregnancy. He prescribed Cytotec to get things started. April 10th my HCG finally naturally hit zero, I spotted on and off for two weeks.  About a month later my period started just about right on time, a couple days after my Ovia app sad it would start. \n\nI have questions:\n\n1. When do you count the first day of your miscarriage? The day your pregnancy was deemed non-viable? When your HCG started going down? Or when it hit 0? Or when your bleeding I stopped?\n\n2.

My levels were low and doubled over 48 hours. The doubling time then increased but my symptoms disappeared. I decided to contact my OB to get a redraw because I just knew my levels had stopped increasing. The only doubled once in 8 days. I am now waiting to miscarry naturally and I have a confirmation ultrasound on Tuesday if I have not by then.

I called my midwife on Tuesday, she sent me for a blood test. I was supposed to have my first appointment on Wednesday. Wednesday morning she called to tell me that my HCG level was 6.9, and that I would not need to come in for the appointment, or the ultrasound they had decided to add when I called the day before. I went for a follow up blood test on Thursday, and my HCG is now at 3.4.

I went in this past Wednesday with bleeding and had blood drawn, hcg was 1657. Bleeding was heavy and I knew it was a miscarriage. \n\nWednesday night I passed the sac, unmistakably. Have never seen anything like that come out of me before. Very surprised (disconcerted too) that it was painless, but I have had a full-term baby vaginally so I suppose it shouldn't surprise me that my cervix can pass a tiny gestational sac without hurting. Incidentally it was small, under 10mm, and a cursory google tells me this would be average for about 5 weeks so, so perhaps embryo never developed to the point of having a blood supply/heartbeat and died the week before I began to bleed. \n\nThursday I had an ultrasound to confirm no ectopic. Nothing in my uterus, sides of uterus were 'back together', nothing concerning showed up.\n\nWent in again on Friday to get another blood test to confirm hormones were coming down appropriately and hcg was 300.\n\nSeems like it has dropped fast! I did an hpt and an opk out of curiosity and both were positive. I will probably keep doing that every 2-3 days until I get a negative hpt. \n\nI was wondering if those numbers compared with anyone else's experience and whether you tracked ovulation in the cycle immediately following a miscarriage this early. I am desperate to try again and have been cleared to do so after I get a negative hpt but I don't know what to expect in terms of cycle length.

I still am not pregnant again, six months after my miscarriage. Last month, after testing and ultrasounds for mysterious severe back pains that last for a couple hours then disappear for weeks, I found out I have gallstones. So now I am torn on whether to TTC this cycle (I'm on CD6) so that I can get my gallbladder removed (surgery scheduled for July, expected CD 11 of next cycle). Here's my thoughts:\n\n- This is cycle 12, but we haven't done any fertility testing yet. As a teacher who lives in a rural area (the hospital is 40 minutes away without traffic), July and August are the most convenient for medical procedures, but I'm not sure how the surgery will affect my cycles. \n- Through tracking my BBT, I seem to alternate LP length between 9 and 11 days, even though my cycle length is constant. The cycle I conceived was an 11 day LP cycle, and my current one is on track to be 11 day LP as well. I think that means I have a slightly better chance of conceiving/implanting this cycle compared to last cycle (or the one in which I have the surgery). \n- If I conceive this cycle, the surgery would have to be cancelled. They won't operate during the 1st or 3rd trimesters if they can avoid it. \n- Pregnancy is known to increase gallstone symptoms. I haven't had a flare-up since March, but who knows what would happen if I conceived before removing my gallbladder. The pain of a flare-up is really intense, worse than my miscarriage (where Tylenol 3 didn't touch the pain). \n\nI'm leaning towards NTNP this cycle, so we aren't actively trying to put off my surgery, but neither are we giving up on the chance of a baby. But since I chart my BBT and my cycles are fairly regular, I will have a good idea of when I'm in my fertile week. I don't want to give up my BBT data from this cycle. \n\nArgh. Thanks for reading if you made it this far. I'm not really looking for advice, I just wanted to vent a bit. Though if you have a suggestion one way or the other....

It does make me question why female fertility (and issues) is not discussed openly but also seeing the experiences and the support that this sub gives really helped me over the past month. \n\n\nA month ago on the 8th May I found out I was pregnant, which would have been the news I was looking for the past year, but not when it was accompanied with heavy spotting, stomach cramps, pain passing urine and stool. I found myself in the nurses room, she did two pregnancy tests and referred me to the on call gynae. That\u2019s when I called my husband in from the waiting room.\n\n\nI had seen the nurse practitioner a week before for an examination after being referred due to some spotting between periods for the last couple of months, so she knew I wasn\u2019t expecting to be pregnant. My cycles had been normal (one had been slightly longer but I linked that to my thyroxine dose and my thyroid becoming overactive\u2013 another story but only found out from hormone tests as TTC), only sign of being pregnant was my left boob being tender and sore to touch. Something I had put down to PMT but had remained so was going to mention next time I saw the doctor.  The positive pregnancy tests were the first positive ones I had seen in a year, I couldn\u2019t believe what I was seeing, which is why the nurse did two tests. \n\n\nWhen I got to the hospital, I went into several rooms, each time they felt my stomach, asked about pain etc, most of that is now a blur, they did a couple of scans, one over the stomach (normal ultra scan) and one internal scan. The Doctors doing the scan advised that they were not specialists in early pregnancy scans but would be able to see if something was where it should be. They noticed a mass of cells by my right ovary, not able to say anything more. They said that it would be best for me to be admitted overnight, repeat the scan in the morning with a qualified technician and in case I need an operation nil by mouth from 2am. \n\n\nDuring the night I cried a lot, nurses came in every two hours to take my blood pressure and other vitals, this I understood to ensure the mass of cells had not ruptured through my fallopian tube. At some point through the night the Doctor came and saw me, she was probably gave me the best information out of all of the doctors, I had researched treatment options for an ectopic (nhs website) and she explained that my treatment would be consultant led, as I was in pain and bleeding, there was more of a chance that it could rupture, therefore the treatment that they are likely to recommend (if scan conclusive next day) would be surgery.\n\n\nThe next day, they repeated the scans, she confirmed, I had a mass of cells by my right ovary, along with a cyst on both ovaries. along with a sac in my womb. I went back to my room and curled up on my bed with my husband and cried.  The doctors came in and explained everything, recommended keyhole surgery. \n\n\nIt was then a waiting game to see when I would be called into surgery, I had been on a drip since I was admitted the night before, but nil by mouth since 2am. I have difficult veins when I am fully hydrated, getting blood out of me was more than a challenge for nurses and junior doctors. The registrar finally got blood out of me. Just the ordeal in getting blood out of me caused extra pain and discomfort. I cried again and again. \n\n\nI finally went into surgery at about 3pm, the notes from my surgery \u2013 ruptured right tubal ectopic pregnancy, normal left tube and ovaries, laparocscopic right salpingectomy (they removed the tube) performed, endometriosis in pouch of douglas, left pelvic side wall, left uteroscral ligament. I was also told that my remaining tube was connected to both ovaries, I questioned this, to be told in the body it\u2019s not the same as the pictures and the ovaries are together behind the womb and this can happen. Took this as positive news. \n\n\nLooking back I am not sure what is worse the first night and the uncertainty and the constant interruptions, or the second night when I was constantly harassed by the nurse to pass urine, and when I did it was really painful and difficult, along with the interruptions. It got easier but I still remember now when going how much of a struggle it was. \n\n\nThe next day they moved me into a shared ward, I managed to wash myself and get dressed, and eat hospital food. I was good to go home, but signed off work for 2 weeks. \n\n\nMy recovery time at home \u2013 I though great I can repeat all the GOT box sets, but no couldn\u2019t deal with them, found myself binge watching catfish and listening to the podcast My Dad Wrote A Porno (so funny \u2013 had to wait until at least week before I could laugh and it didn\u2019t hurt). I was and still very sensitive to programmes and adverts, not sure when I will get less sensitive. \n\n\nThe stitches \u2013 I have three entry holes, one to the right of my belly button, one in the belly button and one towards the left hip. All had dissolvable stitches. The belly button stitches as they were above skin they did not dissolve. I had to get these removed by a nurse 10 days after surgery. The one on the left had a stitch poking out which the inner bit had dissolved, I was able to pull that out. Both made me feel really queasy and I love to pop spots/splinters etc). One month on I now can wear my jeans which waist band fall at the level of the wounds. \n\n\nWondering if anyone knows when I can have a proper bubble bath? I have had one essential oil bath, but really crave a bubble bath and not sure when I can have one.\n\n\nI didn\u2019t get told about the amount of bleeding after the op, I spotted for 10 days, some days heavier than others, no days were heavy enough for a tampon but worrying when I didn\u2019t know to expect it. \nThe whole situation has shown how people deal with the new differently, some people can\u2019t cope, others know exactly what to do. My husband is continues to think that it was a mass of cells, and if they hadn\u2019t removed it they would have killed me. And the positives, we can get pregnant, his sperm doesn\u2019t swim backwards (he was just about to have sperm analysis done). My boss is so understanding, some of the people at work are, others don\u2019t know what to say others ignore the issue.  It is very obvious when people don\u2019t know what to do, but some actions even with best intentions really do hurt. I took the approach to tell people to try and make it more tangible, also by telling people over the phone or via text I don\u2019t have to see their faces, which generally makes me cry. \n\n\nThe look on doctors faces, in hospital or the local gp surgery, when I answer the following questions \n\nIs/was this your first pregnancy? \u2013 \"Yes\".\n\nWere you trying for a while? \u2013 \"yes, a year\".\n\n\nI am better when I can talk straight facts at people, which I have stuck to with my brother &amp; his wife, she due to pop out their first in the next couple of weeks, it was difficult anyway as they got pregnant on the first try, and knew my husband and I were trying. We had a family BBQ at my mum\u2019s I had to be honest with her questions, \n\nHow are you feeling? \u2013 \"not good in a lot of pain today\" (I had very little sleep the night before) \n\nHow are you feeling about everything ? \u2013 \"I don\u2019t want to talk about it\". (I could just see myself falling into hysterical crying) \n\nOne of the actions I mentioned above featured her baby shower, which I found out about via instagram, now I don\u2019t know If they didn\u2019t invite me because\n\n -they didn\u2019t think I should be invited (I\u2019m only going to be the auntie and her sister was there) \n\n- I work during the day\n\n-Or they thought I would be upset with the invite. \n\nI\u2019m more upset finding out about it via instagram, I wouldn\u2019t have gone but at least they could have invited me. \n\n\nI had to take a pregnancy test 3 weeks after the operation, part of me was hoping it was positive and there was a normal growing baby in the sac in my womb (not realistic as I had been bleeding since the op). \n\n\nA couple of nights ago I did a online due date calculator, working from the date of my last normal period, now all I can think about is that I could have had a Christmas baby. Even the point that it would have been the worse timing ever doesn\u2019t register in my feelings. \n\n\nWhat\u2019s next \n\nI see the specialist about my endometriosis in July, I have been told not to try to conceive before this apt. \n\nI would like to hope that things get better, that I am more emotional at the moment because I am getting PMT and my normal cycles will start again, so we can start trying again. \n\nWait for my left boob to realise I am not pregnant and stop being tender/sore (I've been told this could be 6 weeks).\n\nEdit: formating \nThank you for reading this, I didn\u2019t think I could write so much. \n", "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "ttcafterloss", "subreddit_id": "t5_34scd", "suggested_sort": null, "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Introduction", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/ttcafterloss/comments/6gbd63/introduction/"}, {"approved_at_utc": null, "author": "AutoModerator", "author_created_utc": 1325741068, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_text": null, "author_fullname": "t2_6l4z3", "banned_at_utc": null, "brand_safe": false, "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1497078451, "distinguished": "moderator", "domain": "self.ttcafterloss", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/ttcafterloss/comments/6gdzvn/ttcafterloss_ttc_daily_discussion_thread_june_10/", "gilded": 0, "id": "6gdzvn", "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_css_class": "ttc", "link_flair_text": "TTC Thread", "locked": false, "media_embed": {}, "num_comments": 43, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/ttcafterloss/comments/6gdzvn/ttcafterloss_ttc_daily_discussion_thread_june_10/", "retrieved_on": 1500125117, "score": 5, "secure_media_embed": {}, "selftext": "**This thread is for members who are TTC or waiting to try.

Afterwards, I shared a bit about how my \"morning sickness\" didn't end; I had extreme nausea and vomiting so we were WTT until I found out what was up.\n\nWell it turns out I have a genetic condition called Familial Adenomatous Polyposis (FAP, lol) which causes polyps to grow in the digestive tract. I ended up having an emergency surgery to remove my colon and inside of it they found a cancerous tumor which was blocking food from getting through (hence the vomiting and weight loss).\n\nI'm now about to start chemo and then need another operation as the cancer had already spread to my liver by the time it was discovered. Then I'll need a third surgery to remove my rectum and anus as the polyps are everywhere.\n\nI've decided not to delay chemo and freeze my eggs, so I'm not sure where this will leave my fertility. The rectum surgery may make it impossible to carry a child, anyways. I'm not sure.\n\nI'm thankful to my little Leo for alerting me to my health issues but I'm so desperately sad that I wasn't healthy enough to give him a fighting chance at life. \n\nAll I know is that I can't think about TTC anymore; I have to think about the fight ahead.

My dnc was exactly a month ago, and I eased into my exercise and weight loss routine very slowly after it. In fact, I didn't really accomplish exercising 3 times a week until last week, and I didn't calorie count until last week. But the results of doing a week of calorie counting and exercising is that I'm ridiculously tired, almost pregnancy level, \"can't lift my head up mid-afternoon\" tired. I've kept taking pre-natal vitamins, and I've put \"lose 0.2kg a week\" as a goal into \"my fitness pal\" so I'm not really restricting my calories that much. Because I was aware that Chinese people (like my people) have a very different attitude toward what one should do after a miscarriage,I googled \"weight loss after miscarriage\" in chinese and it's always strongly advised against, with the reasoning that a miscarriage is like a birth and in fact, I should've done 2 weeks to a month of after birth care where I eat and drink nutrious things that new mothers eat and drink. It's making me think I should just give up calorie counting and exercising and focus purely on eating nutritiously? But my belly is (to my eye), the biggest it's ever been, and I'm not fitting in my old clothes, so from a self confidence perspective I really want to lose some weight. Is it really counter productive to attempt weight loss a month after a mc? I feel as if I can't do a gentler weight loss program, since exercising 3 times a week was what I was doing pre-pregnancy and lose 0.2kg per week is such a low reach goal. But did my body just change that much after the pregnancy and MC that I should be just that much gentler, and stop the calorie counting?

I've had a host of complications on and off since then. \n\nWarning: Thyroid jargon impending.\n\nI've occasionally had instances (an on various pills) where my levels would inexplicably go haywire. I'm recovering from an instance like that now. The last time I had an instance like this, I was told to wait several months before TTC. I did, levels went back to normal with some dose tweaking, and I conceived my daughter first month trying. No issues, and remarkably, my thyroid levels stayed somewhat stable throughout pregnancy and I only changed my dose maybe once or twice.\n\nI had two early miscarriages (one at 7 weeks, one technically a CP) following my daughter's birth, and we discovered it was because my thyroid levels had gone too hypo while tweaking my dose lower postpartum. We worked on adjusting over the several months since, had gotten almost perfect, then WHAM -- my levels went super hypo again.\n\nThis was pretty depressing, but I badgered my endo into upping my dose more aggressively to get me into TTC levels and he agreed. Then, surprise, despite my terrible levels and my husband and I practicing overly cautious pulling out, I got pregnant. I then lost the pregnancy very early, again (I'm currently bleeding right now).\n\nMy endo insists it was because my levels probably weren't stable yet (I'm getting them tested at the end of this week). This is likely true. But I also know this is loss #3 in a row, and I know that tends to be a magic number for concern. I asked if he could test progesterone too just to be safe, but he said he wouldn't do that and to go to my gyno. I'm now waiting to hear back from my midwife to see if she'll run it.\n\nIncidentally, I had had a lot of the clotting factors checked years ago for a suspected TIA (ended up being a migraine with facial paralysis) that all turned out fine, and I remember the doctor then noting, \"This is the same bloodwork we do for women dealing with infertility, so you should be good to go!\" \n\nSo knowing all this -- should I just chalk all of this up to thyroid levels probably not being stable then? I'm worried we'll finally get them stable and then, because we focused so much on thyroid, miss that there might have been another issue contributing to the losses. And at the same time, a probably illogical part of me goes, \"If I was still able to get pregnant THREE times despite these levels, could they really be so bad as to cause these recurring early losses? Is it really the thyroid issues causing this?\"", "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "ttcafterloss", "subreddit_id": "t5_34scd", "suggested_sort": null, "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Is there any point in additional testing if I know I have a thyroid issue?", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/ttcafterloss/comments/6gukkd/is_there_any_point_in_additional_testing_if_i/"}, {"approved_at_utc": null, "author": "kittyvonsquillion", "author_created_utc": 1407463959, "author_flair_css_class": "", "author_flair_text": "TTC#1, MMC, MC", "author_fullname": "t2_hs0pq", "banned_at_utc": null, "brand_safe": false, "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1497299147, "domain": "self.ttcafterloss", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/ttcafterloss/comments/6guwah/weird_cycle_any_idea_what_it_means/", "gilded": 0, "id": "6guwah", "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "locked": false, "media_embed": {}, "num_comments": 4, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/ttcafterloss/comments/6guwah/weird_cycle_any_idea_what_it_means/", "retrieved_on": 1500134216, "score": 6, "secure_media_embed": {}, "selftext": "Alright, this is a weird one - I've asked the folks at r/stilltrying for help, but the thread drew blanks.

Although I'd had somewhat irregular periods before that, they always arrived every month or so (except for one stretch when I started college where it was missing for 5 months, but I've heard that can happen when undergoing a big life change). Anyway - after going off the pill, three months passed and no period, no withdrawal bleeding, nothing. \n\nI went to the doctor, who I think at first thought I may have PCOS (she asked me about acne or weight gain, I have none of them), but then she did an ultrasound and said that it looked like I was about to ovulate and everything looked great and normal (no cysts, etc). After that I DID get a period 2 weeks later, but a very short and light one.\n\nThen I started tracking ovulation - I didn't ovulate or have a period that month, but I did ovulate the next month, on CD45 (so late, I know). I ended up getting pregnant! But I miscarried at six weeks. Although the doctors reassured me that it had nothing to do with ovulating so late, I feel like it MUST have something to do with it. I've read some research that the egg can be \"cooked\" or \"bad\" when you ovulate so late.\n\nAnyway - now I'm waiting for my period to come back again, but feel totally hopeless since I already went so long without one, and now with the MC I feel like it may  never show up. And even if it does, when I do TTC again, I'm going to be so paranoid to even try when I do ovulate, unless by some miracle I ovulate on perfect CD14. \n\nFeeling so lost and scared...\n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "ttcafterloss", "subreddit_id": "t5_34scd", "suggested_sort": null, "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Intro and Advice", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/ttcafterloss/comments/6gyutr/intro_and_advice/"}]}
