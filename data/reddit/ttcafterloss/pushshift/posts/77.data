I should be 6 weeks today (or maybe only 5 weeks 4 days) and the doctor couldn't see anything on ultrasound.

I'm so very afraid.  I don't want to believe that I am miscarrying or carrying an ectopic and want to believe that this is actually going to work out.  But the doctor is too concerned that if I wait to take the injection I could be in trouble with a growing ectopic.  Also, I don't want to take methotrexate and pause TTC as I wait for folate levels to rise (my last loss included a neural tube defect among others).  I suppose it is not worth the risk to my life to halt taking the injection?

I weighed the pros and cons, but my Dr really couldn't guarantee which option was the best and left it mostly up to me.\n\nI ended up deciding to take the MTX shot, with a follow up on Monday to check my HCG levels and take a second shot depending on if they are dropping accordingly. \n\nHere I am, almost 24 hours later, and I'm still not bleeding. I havent had any severe pain for almost 24 hrs and I've also had time to properly research the decision I've made to take the drugs instead of select to have surgery. \n\nI have only read one study where women with such high HCG levels have had success...mainly when there is no fetal heartbeat (which they would not detect) and the pregnancy is under 2.5cm (mine is 2cm).\n\nCan anyone here offer any experience with an ectopic with such high HCG levels? \n\nI'm considering calling my Dr again and just asking for the surgery. I didnt realize the MTX would be such a long process...although she did explain this to me, I dont think I REALLY thought about it. \n\nThis fucking sucks and I dont think I've even had time to process this as a loss. Right now, I'm just scared of tubal rupture. I'm scared of having to go back to the ER. \n\nThank you all..im sorry we are all here.", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "ttcafterloss", "subreddit_id": "t5_34scd", "subreddit_subscribers": 5492, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Ectopic with high hcg levels.

Unfortunately, it was quite short lived. \n\nWe discovered around 7 weeks along that our baby had stopped growing. My doctor didn\u2019t want to do a D&amp;C, and rather wanted to wait for things to happen naturally. When nothing had happened 4 weeks later, discovered my placenta was still growing and my HCG had increased from 19000 at time of the growth end to around 48000 and finally scheduled a D&amp;C. We had the procedure on May 15, and as of May 23 the HCG was down to 545 and seems to be moving in the right direction finally. \n\nI\u2019ve been struggling to come to peace with this, as unfair as it has felt to me, and putting faith and confidence in moving forward and knowing this will happen for us and I just want for my body to do what it does so we can officially try again and not pass any more time by. This weekend was especially tough as it was our \u201cannouncement weekend\u201d as we moved into the second trimester, but we never got that far. \n\nAnd then I wake up to my best friend texting me a picture of a positive pregnancy test. For a baby she wasn\u2019t trying for. With a man she\u2019s been dating for a month. \n\nI love my friend. I genuinely do. And I am happy for her because I know she had fears that she may not be able to have children, so I hope in my heart that this works for her and goes positively. \n\nBut, my God that was hard news to take in and be positive and supportive on. \n\nI\u2019m sure it seems like I\u2019m asking for thoughts on dealing with other people announcing pregnancies, etc., but really I want to know what people\u2019s experiences are getting pregnant after a MMC on Clomid - timelines, experiences, etc. \n\nIt\u2019s a focus of mine right now and I know everyone\u2019s experiences are different, but it would help having an idea", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "ttcafterloss", "subreddit_id": "t5_34scd", "subreddit_subscribers": 5508, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Recovering after first loss, outside pregnancy announcements, and trying again... talk to me", "total_awards_received": 0, "updated_utc": 1559644262, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/ttcafterloss/comments/bu68lm/recovering_after_first_loss_outside_pregnancy/"}, {"all_awardings": [], "author": "Connor04242019", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_3unwghl8", "author_patreon_flair": false, "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1559093803, "domain": "self.ttcafterloss", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/ttcafterloss/comments/bu8kec/fathers_day/", "gildings": {}, "id": "bu8kec", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_css_class": "support", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_template_id": "0b925822-beed-11e4-97e6-22000b3c81cc", "link_flair_text": "Support", "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 5, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/ttcafterloss/comments/bu8kec/fathers_day/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1559093808, "score": 39, "selftext": "I lost my son, Connor, at 18 weeks gestation on April 24, 2019 at 2:26 a.m.. \n\nAside from my little man, my husband is the most amazing man I\u2019ve ever met.

I want to tell my story of my miscarriage to maybe help begin to heal. I was surprised to find out I was pregnant at the end of February, but my husband and I were so excited. This was my first pregnancy.\n\nOn Thursday, May 23rd I went in for an appointment at 16 weeks pregnant. They could not find a heartbeat, which has happened several times before (tilted uterus) so I was not concerned when they set up an ultrasound. I laid down expecting to see my baby bouncing around in my womb and I knew immediately the baby was gone. There was no movement and the ultrasound tech quickly moved the screen and rubbed my arm and said she would be as fast as possible. I started crying. After what felt like an eternity, the doctor finically confirmed my fears. The baby had passed away the week before. Thank God I text my mom during the ultrasound and said things didn\u2019t look right and she headed to the doctors office. She arrived right after they confirmed the baby had passed. \n\nThey gave me the option of having a D&amp;C/E or being induced. Since it was a holiday weekend, they said the D&amp;C/E would not be able to be scheduled until the following Tuesday. I opted for being immediately induced. I could not handle the waiting. \n\nThey sent me over to the hospital and my husband and I were placed in a nice private room at the far end of the labor/delivery unit. The doctors and nurses were so amazing. They were the most caring, empathetic, loving people I have ever experienced. They placed the medicine against my cervix and told me to sit back and wait. At that moment I realized this might take longer than just a couple hours. \n\nThe cramps started about four hours in when they put the second dose of medicine against my cervix. They also started pumping me with pain killers to help numb me a little emotionally. I was a mess, and the doctor was totally fine with drugging me up to help the process be less traumatic. About 10 hours into the induction, I started to have diarrhea and a fever. I also was starting to freak out and asked if I could go to any hospital nearby that would be willing to give me a D&amp;C/E. Unfortunately nowhere was willing to do it without a preliminary appointment and it would take a couple days, so I decided to continue with the induction.\n\nAbout 23 hours after starting the meds, my cramps became severe enough that I thought I would get an epidural. As the nurse walked in to discuss it with me, I felt the baby come. The nurse and my husband held me as I wept. The placenta took about 30 minutes to come out, so for that time I laid there with my baby between my legs. \n\nI was so scared to see the baby, but the nurse encouraged me to do it. He was a perfect little baby who was so tiny and precious. I was able to hold him and say goodbye. My husband and both of our moms were also able to hold the little baby. He measured about 5\u201d and was 4 ounces. We instantly fell in love with him. We felt so connected to our sweet baby. We were able to leave about 3 hours later and my husband and I wept on the car ride home over the emptiness that we both felt. \n\nWe decided to get testing done to try to figure out what happened. The doctor seemed very sure it was chromosomal. I have blamed myself for it even though everyone says it is nothing I did. I am a teacher, so I have decided to go back to work for the last day of school on Friday, which will be exactly one week from when I delivered my sweet baby. I had told my work I would not be back for the next school year, so I had to ask for my job back, which was horrible and so sad. All I want to be doing is taking care of my baby, not figuring out if my job will take me back.\n\nI am struggling with the grief, sadness, hormones, everything. The mornings are the worst for me. I cry constantly, but my husband has been incredible. He is such a huge support, and has cried with me, and held me. Today I went to the doctor to get something to help me get through these insane hormones and grief. Thankfully she agreed to give me some Ativan which made today seem slightly more normal. I feel like I will be able to make it through the school day on Friday with minimal crying now. \n\nOf course now I have huge baby fever. I am aching for a baby. My doctor said no trying for six months, but I feel like I am going to question her on that more when I go in 3 weeks from now. \n\nDid anyone else go to 16 weeks and have to wait six months? \n\nThank you for reading my story. As my bleeding and cramps subside I worry the importance of the baby will also disappear. I want to remember every detail of him and how important and precious he was.", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "ttcafterloss", "subreddit_id": "t5_34scd", "subreddit_subscribers": 5514, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Intro - 16 weeks gone", "total_awards_received": 0, "updated_utc": 1559652633, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/ttcafterloss/comments/bumczb/intro_16_weeks_gone/"}, {"all_awardings": [], "author": "AutoModerator", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_6l4z3", "author_patreon_flair": false, "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1559200271, "distinguished": "moderator", "domain": "self.ttcafterloss", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/ttcafterloss/comments/buq57n/ttcafterloss_daily_discussion_thread_1_may_30_2019/", "gildings": {}, "id": "buq57n", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_css_class": "ttc", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text": "TTC Thread", "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 14, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/ttcafterloss/comments/buq57n/ttcafterloss_daily_discussion_thread_1_may_30_2019/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1559200295, "score": 1, "selftext": "**How are you doing today?

I miscarried at 8w and we don't know why. I have always leaned more towards doctors than midwives, and so has my husband. My view was kind if like, why *not* see someone who has been all the way through medical school? However, I went through THREE obstetricians during the pregnancy/miscarriage. I don't know if I am being crazy or they really do suck. When I knew something was wrong, doc #1 downright refused to run any labs to find the problem, and was just like, \"we'll see what happens\". So I went to doc #2. He was great, ordered ultrasounds + labs, saw some obvious issues and diagnosed threatened miscarriage. I told him that in the last year, workups showed I was vitamin d deficient and I don't metabolize folate correctly, and asked if we could look into that. I also told him my luteal phase was only 7 days. HE LAUGHED and said no, that I'm fine and luteal phase defect didn't exist, and folate doesn't affect pregnancy. 2 weeks later, I  miscarried. Went to doctor #3 for a follow up. Told him about the vitamin d and folate thing. He said thats ridiculous to think a vitamin d deficiency could cause harm and too many people are paranoid about vitamin d...also luteal phase defect doesn't exist. Totally dismissed me. \n\nAll 3 of these doctors are at the two clinics that people go to for pregnancy, and all three are extremely well reviewed by patients. Am I really being crazy and paranoid? I'm seriously considering seeing a midwife instead when/if I conceive again because it's the one thing I haven't tried. I honestly know nothing about how midwives are different...would they maybe be more thorough, if just for my peace of mind? If I am lucky enough to get pregnant again, I am going to be miserable with anxiety if doctors won't let me make sure I'm not missing anything, because another loss will kill me... especially if I wasn't allowed to do everything possible to prevent it.", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "ttcafterloss", "subreddit_id": "t5_34scd", "subreddit_subscribers": 5521, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "A loaded question/doctors suck", "total_awards_received": 0, "updated_utc": 1559658013, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/ttcafterloss/comments/buw9d7/a_loaded_questiondoctors_suck/"}, {"all_awardings": [], "author": "AutoModerator", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_6l4z3", "author_patreon_flair": false, "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1559239763, "domain": "self.ttcafterloss", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/ttcafterloss/comments/buwgod/ttcafterloss_daily_discussion_thread_2_may_30_2019/", "gildings": {}, "id": "buwgod", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 17, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/ttcafterloss/comments/buwgod/ttcafterloss_daily_discussion_thread_2_may_30_2019/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1559239765, "score": 2, "selftext": "**How are you doing today?

I\u2019m so frustrated and I just need to get this out before I explode. \n\nThe stats: My husband (33 M) and I (32F)  have been TTC for one year now. Had a successful conception on our own right before OB put me on Letrozole for developing big follicles (although we didn\u2019t realize I was already pregnant until later). Had a strong heartbeat and good ultrasound at 7 weeks, then lost the pregnancy at 8 weeks for unexplained reasons. Medical abortion didn\u2019t work so we had to do D&amp;C (right before Christmas, of all times). Everything went as planned and we started TTC again in late January 2019. At first we did it the old fashioned way. Then we started doing Letrozole to grow the follicles + trigger shot to start ovulation + estrogen and progesterone 3 x daily in order to hopefully conceive and keep a pregnancy. This past month we did IUI. Today I got my 5th BFN of this year. \n\nYay. \n\nWe\u2019ve tried every single goddamned month since January and NOTHING. Not ONE positive pregnancy test. \n\nWe\u2019ve both had our equipment looked at/scanned/poked and prodded and there\u2019s nothing apparently wrong with either of us. No infertility in either of our families. No obvious reason why this isn\u2019t working. I\u2019m just getting so incredibly down about it all. I\u2019m tired of scheduled sex. I\u2019m tired of getting BFNs EVERY SINGLE MONTH. I\u2019m tired of my OB saying \u201cI feel good about this round!\u201d And \u201cWe\u2019re going to get you a baby, don\u2019t worry!\u201d\n\nWe are very fortunate in the fact that we have the means to continue doing this\u2014as well as IVF and even a gestational carrier if it comes to that\u2014but it\u2019s still a huge financial strain as money we were trying to save, put into a retirement account, or even use to start a college fund is being earmarked for more fertility treatments/attempts. I should be thankful that we are technically *able* to take advantage of these options, but instead I just feel bitter about the fact that it will still be a major financial hardship. It\u2019s upsetting to both of us that thousands (and possibly hundreds of thousands) of our hard earned money will have to be spent on something that most couples can achieve for free. \n\nI just feel so pissed off and bitter. And I know that doesn\u2019t help this entire process of TTC, but I don\u2019t know how to change it. \n\nPerhaps the worst part of all of this, for me, is the look on my husband\u2019s face when we get a BFN. It\u2019s breaking his heart and I can\u2019t do anything to fix it. I just can\u2019t bear seeing him hurt like this. I want to comfort him but I find myself incapable of doing so because I\u2019m so frustrated myself. And I just don\u2019t have anything reassuring to say to him, because I don\u2019t even have anything reassuring to say to myself. \n\nThank you for letting me vent. I\u2019m sorry for anything I may have said that triggered anyone or rubbed anyone the wrong way.

Trying to understand how my body will readjust after the miscarriage, I logged it as CD1 and started to record my bbt again. \n\n\nTemperature-wise, it is astonishing obvious how hectic my body was when trying to readjust those first days. Two weeks after my miscarriage, my bbt chart started to follow my regular pattern. I've had my usual temperature drop before a steady rise so both apps (Flo and premom) have \"detected ovulation\" on the same day. Funny enough, it was after some days of watery CM.\n\n\nBut here comes the thing. Every single OPK I've done have been negative. I'm not talking about \"not so sure\" results. I'm talking about 11 OPKs with the faintest lines ever. I had to log the results manually in premom because it will automatically set the result to 0. The maximum I got was 0.25. So, yep. That kind of faint lines.\n\n\nAlthough this is my first month using OPKs, I was counting on them for accuracy. So I was simply ruling out this cycle as anovulatory.

But as time goes on, I find myself physically dreading going to work, and once I'm there, I have no concentration or focus. Since my son died, my job (and my career in general) feel so...pointless. I just can't imagine spending 30+ years doing what I do and looking back and thinking - wow, that was a life of *meaning*. \n\nI'm working in therapy on what might be \"next\" but I wanted to know: **did any of you successfully change jobs or careers after your loss**? **Are you glad you did**? **What compelled you to make the change**? **Would you do it again**?", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "ttcafterloss", "subreddit_id": "t5_34scd", "subreddit_subscribers": 5542, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Anyone change careers/leave job after loss?", "total_awards_received": 0, "updated_utc": 1559687251, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/ttcafterloss/comments/bwcg6a/anyone_change_careersleave_job_after_loss/"}, {"all_awardings": [], "author": "bb2211", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_3ppxgwcx", "author_patreon_flair": false, "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1559580102, "domain": "self.ttcafterloss", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/ttcafterloss/comments/bwcteg/3_miscarriages_and_feeling_defeated/", "gildings": {}, "id": "bwcteg", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_css_class": "trigger", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_template_id": "7465d7b8-7120-11e4-9568-12313d14791d", "link_flair_text": "Trigger - Loss", "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 16, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/ttcafterloss/comments/bwcteg/3_miscarriages_and_feeling_defeated/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1559580104, "score": 47, "selftext": "I just found out this morning that I am having my third missed miscarriage.

Weird to say that I hope people here have some experience with this because I wish it on no one, but some support would be appreciated:\n\nA few weeks ago I posted about our 18 week anatomy scan and how there were a few concerning findings. We did an amnio but were told it didn\u2019t look like a genetic issue and basically just to wait the three weeks to see the follow up scan. The karyotype testing all did come back normal and at our 21 week scan our baby\u2019s brain looked totally normal - the choroid plexus cysts were gone and the entire cerebellum was seen. Baby\u2019s kidneys had duplicating collecting systems but the MFM said it\u2019s basically meaningless with a slight chance of UTIs. \n\nThat same day we got insurance pre-approval for the microarray portion of the amnio. I was actually hesitant to do it because I worried about getting a result of unknown significance that would stress us out. But my husband wanted it and the genetic counselor said since they already had the sample and there is a kidney abnormality, it was worth it. \n\nTen days later, after we finally relaxed back into pregnancy and all but forgot about the impending results, the genetic counselor called. Over the phone she explained that there was a large deletion and went over some basics and suggested I come in with my husband. I knew then and there that it was over. I made him come home immediately and sobbed as I told him the news. At our appointment two hours later, the genetic counselor explained how many genes were affected by a deletion of this size and also informed us that it\u2019s extremely rare - she was only able to find ten similar cases. My husband and I knew immediately we would terminate. We cried. \n\nAt our hospital these late D&amp;Es are only done on Fridays, so we had to wait a week, though they started treating my cervix on Wednesday. So this past Friday, at 23+4, our pregnancy ended. We were previously not finding our baby\u2019s gender but learned from the amnio report she was a girl. We named her Skylar. \n\nWe\u2019re devastated and pretty lost. Physically I\u2019m uncomfortable, particularly now that my breasts are engorged (anyone have any tips on dealing with this?). But emotionally we basically live in a loop of crying/being devastated, managing to distract ourselves, then remembering and being sad all over again. Truly don\u2019t know how to handle grief like this. Hoping to get us in to see a counselor soon because I\u2019m at a loss of how to get us both through this. \n\nI spoke to my RE and he said generally between waiting for HCG to go down and wanting to check for scarring, it would be 2-3 months before we could get back to trying. We will be tested to make sure this was a fluke and not something we have and were told it almost certainly is, though so far we\u2019ve managed to be unlucky in every way so not sure how much comfort to take from that. \n\nAnyway, I don\u2019t know what else to say.

My doctor scheduled me for a D&amp;C to happen tomorrow.  He recommended doing genetic testing as this is my second MMC.  The first one, last November, was a blighted ovum.  \n\nI was told that they use Natera Anora kits for genetic testing and that it was my responsibility to contact Natera to determine costs and insurance coverage.  Natera was very hard to get in touch with but they told me that they are out-of-network for my insurance and the out of pocket expense was $799 if insurance did not cover it.  My insurance company confirmed they were out of network but stated the testing would be covered if my doctor provided precertification.  My doctor's office was huffy about this and said they never had to provide precertification but nevertheless called my insurance company to authorize it and were informed that a panel would have to determine whether or not to cover the testing and they would make a decision in 2-5 business days.  Ridiculous.\n\nI don't want to delay the D&amp;C for many reasons but I obviously won't have a concrete answer about whether this testing is covered before the procedure tomorrow morning.  My question is this:  is the testing even worth it?  My understanding is that the majority of miscarriages are due to chromosomal errors that aren't likely to be repeated with future pregnancies.  And there is the risk that the test may be inconclusive.  So if the test doesn't provide me with much useful information for a future pregnancy, why get the testing?

I've been lurking here the past few days, but things have taken a turn and I wanted to introduce myself sooner rather than later on.\n\nSo, story time.\n\nMy husband and I started trying for our first last month.  We were unicorns, and we found out the day of my missed period.  For a week, I had increasing pregnancy symptoms (mainly increase in sense of smell and nausea).  I was so excited to be pregnant so quickly.  We started trying in May largely for sentimental reasons, even though we thought that July made better sense timing wise.  We were on an international trip, and I knew that I'd find out if I was pregnant while we were in Paris.  France was my Grandfather's favorite country and Paris was his favorite city.  I was always very close with him, and both of our potential children's names are tied to him in some way.  Not only that, but the due date of this pregnancy would have been within a week of his birthday.  My husband and I both thought it was meant to be, I even said that I'd be less worried about miscarrying if I ended up getting pregnant this cycle, because it just felt so right.  I very much regret thinking and saying that now.\n\nMy test progression wasn't what I thought it should be and my tests never got very pink.  I started bright red spotting on 20dpo.  I called my doc, they had me come in for betas and an ultrasound.  My betas were very low, only 38.  They saw nothing on the ultrasound (of course, my HCG was so low they didn't expect to), just a thickening of my uterine lining. They sent me on my way and scheduled follow up betas.  I started bleeding heavy, so they had me come in again for another blood draw and pelvic exam.  At this point, my betas were still 38 and I was bleeding a lot, so they told me that I was definitely having a miscarriage.  They sent me home, told me what to expect and scheduled a follow-up blood draw for yesterday.\n\nYesterday rolls around and I did my blood test. I wasn't concerned because I clearly miscarried - or so I thought.  I had been bleeding for 6 days at this point. They got the results and told me that my HCG levels actually increased to 61.  This would be a 5 day doubling time, so definitely not viable regardless of implantation location.  However, the fact that they're increasing so slowly and I bled for so long makes both me, and my doctor, believe I'm having an ectopic pregnancy.\n\nThey're having me come in again today to meet with the doctor and have another ultrasound.  My HCG is so low that they don't expect to see anything regardless... I'm trying not to freak out, but having an ectopic pregnancy was always my worst fear.  I had just come to terms with the fact that I'd lost this pregnancy and now I'm still in this state of limbo.\n\nIf anyone has dealt with anything similar, I'd love to hear your experience.  I'm hoping that they'll just give me a Methotrexate shot and that my HCG will drop super quick because it's so low anyways.  However, I have this fear that they're going to want to wait and see if they can confirm that it's ectopic before doing so... Either way, I'm so glad that I have an amazing doctor who has been monitoring me super closely and taking everything so seriously.  I feel blessed in that regard.\n\nMoving forward, I have no idea what the hell to do.  I know that I don't have to know right now, but I can't help but have it on my mind.  My husband and I always said that if I miscarried we would only wait as long as the doctor recommended.  However, with this likely being ectopic I'm petrified of going through it all again, especially with increased chances of it being ectopic in the future.  \n\nSo anyways, hello.
