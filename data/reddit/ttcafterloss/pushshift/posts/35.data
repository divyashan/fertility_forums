I had seen this subreddit after our 5w miscarriage in 2015, when we struggled for almost a year to get pregnant again. At the time, I wasn't sure that this sub was the type of support I needed so I checked out other avenues of support instead. I could really use some support from you guys now. This is long because I just need to vent.\n\nAfter getting pregnant again and passing all the \"risk milestones,\" we felt like this was the one. Sadly, our daughter Violet passed away and was born on Thanksgiving day, at 20 weeks.\n\nMy husband and I are struggling to keep it together. We support each other and have a great network of friends and loved ones, but it is so hard. We agreed that we would wait 6 months before revisiting the idea of trying a third time. Docs are doing genetic testing to give us a better idea of what went wrong and how likely it is to happen again.\n\nSometimes I want nothing more than to get pregnant again, thinking it was just bad luck. But part of me is so afraid to try again. I keep feeling like we are the cliched good people that bad things happen to. I'm  irrationally angry at extended family who \"pray for us\" or say it's part of God's plan for us. How could you put your faith and support in a God who could kill my daughter and torture us like this? Not trying to bash anyone's faith, just venting. I find myself angry at a God I don't believe in.\n\nI just need to hear it's going to get better. Or commiseration that it sucks and it isn't fair. I am stuck between longing for a baby and feeling terrified at getting pregnant again. \n\nDocs started me on Zoloft for PPD and anxiety, but not long after starting it, I got a huge rash all over my chest. They couldn't tell if it was from the medicine or Violet's cremation necklace, because they were the only two new things and I got them at the same time. So I had to not wear her necklace for almost two weeks while they sorted it out, which shattered me (it was the Zoloft in the end and they switched me to Lexipro).

We went there and found out that my husband would have to stay in the waiting room; not even allowed to be there when I'm talking to the doctor or in the recovery room. And they told me I can either pay $900 upfront or if I try to bill it to my insurance but they don't pay out, the clinic will automatically charge my card $2700. I was trying to figure out what to do since there's a chance maybe they won't pay since I wasn't explicitly referred to this clinic and that's a lot of money to gamble, and then I just thought, screw this, I'm just going to go to the hospital my OB recommended where my husband isn't going to be treated like he's not involved in this too and it doesn't feel like making sure they get money out of me is more important than treating my health issue. 45 minutes of sitting in a waiting room playing nothing but pop music like Ke$ha and Katy Perry was not helping either.\n\nAnd hence the week long wait before anything gets done about this. I just want to move on and start TTC again. I want this over with ASAP so I can get my period sooner and start ovulating again. I also just want the reminder gone.

But we were both quietly elated and I felt relieved that I'd be pregnant on my due date so the day wouldn't hurt so bad. \n\nAnd then last night I started spotting dark brown blood, which my google searches reassured me was not a definite sign of miscarriage.  But today, I woke up to bright red blood and lots of it, cramps and passing tissue.  My hope that this year would start out joyful is gone. \n\nIt just seems so cruel that it had to start today.   \n\nUpdate: My miscarriage was confirmed at the ER.

We found out we were pregnant in early December after our first IUI. I was shocked that it worked the first time, and elated to have a positive just a few days before my 31st birthday and weeks before Christmas! I couldn't believe our luck. \n\nUnfortunately, at our 6 week ultrasound, just before Christmas, the baby was measuring a week behind. I spent the week of Christmas in anxious limbo, expecting the worst and hoping for the best. At our follow up ultrasound this past Thursday the baby had only grown two days and our doctor told us the pregnancy wasn't viable. I stopped my progesterone shots that night. \n\nWe are absolutely devastated, to say the least. We were actively trying all year for this baby and each month we were unsuccessful was so hard. Then, to have received this wonderful gift only to have it taken away is unbelievable to me. Honestly, its made me question everything I believe about God and life and how I see the world in general. \n\nI've had to get off social media because I absolutely cannot bear to see the Christmas and New Year baby announcements. Its killing me. \n\nI still feel pregnant, with sore boobs and nausea. I was hoping my body would start the process on its own relatively soon after stopping progesterone. But I think I'm going to call the doctor on Monday to schedule a D&amp;C to just so I can get it over with. \n\nMy doctor said, \"silver lining, we know you can get pregnant now, this is good news.\" My husband says, \"we will try again right away and make another baby.\" But I wanted this baby. I wanted this one to work. What was the purpose in even getting pregnant if it was going to end like this? I'm seriously struggling. Not only have I lost this pregnancy, I've lost hope and joy and I feel like I've lost my faith. Not to mention the lost time that puts us even further behind our goal of becoming parents. What a shitty way to start 2017. \n\nAnyway, thanks for reading and letting me vent. I just needed to write it out.

Please excuse my formatting issues. I have no idea what I'm doing. I've been lurking in this sub since my loss and I finally found the courage to share my story with all you lovely internet strangers. I'll apologize in advance for the word vomit that may happen, I need to get this out.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nSo, here's my story: (tw - stillbirth)\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nMy DH (29) and I (30) were very surprised when we found out that we had conceived on our first try in March this year. Everything was going well, no morning sickness or nausea, just really bad heartburn starting around week 20, no big deal. Found out we were having a baby boy and started preparing everything. We were *almost* done putting all of the finished touches on the nursery.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nFriday night, Nov 5, right before bed, I realized I hadn't felt him move in a while but DH assured me that it's happened before and he was probably just sleeping. The next day, I started pulling everything out to pack into my hospital bag, picked out his going home outfit, packed the diaper bag, and the car seat was ready. He still wasn't really moving. As a FTM, I figured he was just getting himself into place an running out of room. I had a growth scan scheduled for Monday and figured everything would be fine. Sunday comes around, and I wake up with a sick feeling in my gut. He stopped moving. I called L&amp;D and was told to go get monitored.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nThe nurse gets out the heart monitor and starts moving it all over my belly. At this point, I look at DH and start freaking out. She tells me she's going to get the midwife on call to perform an ultrasound. There's no heartbeat. What happened next felt like something you only see in movies when a mother loses their child. I screamed so hard that I scared myself.\n\nI was induced and given all the pain meds possible and an epidural. Right before it was time to push, the midwife on call (who was absolutely amazing at calming me down through this shit storm) told me something that I'll probably never forget. She told me that he was going to be perfect.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nHe was perfect. Born sleeping 37w2d at 7:40am on Monday, November 7, 2016 weighing 4 lbs. 8 oz. He had my hair and my nose. DH and I are completely heartbroken.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nThey said I had a textbook pregnancy and don't know what happened. I have a consultation with MFM this coming Friday to get the autopsy results. I'm not sure what kind of questions I should have ready for this appointment. I'm scared. I'm sick of crying. I'm sick of hurting. I'm sick of everyone treating me differently and ignoring me. I just want my baby.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nThanks for reading if you made it this far.

During the two weeks of recovery, I told myself that I am thankful to be alive and that I'm (sorta) okay with losing this pregnancy and my tube. My first day back to work today,  I find out there's more newly pregnant girls, and that one of them has the same due date that I would have had (Aug 6 2017). She told me in the most considerate way and has been nothing short of compassionate for me and for what just happened. Yet I can't help but feel angry that she got pregnant two weeks after stopping her birth control, and that her pregnancy has been textbook perfect. So now here I am, trying to get through another 9 hours without crying at work, and trying to keep telling myself that  I'm thankful to be alive and that I'm okay.", "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "ttcafterloss", "subreddit_id": "t5_34scd", "suggested_sort": null, "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Can anyone else relate??

Long time lurker, first time poster. I have posted my story of loss in the abort!on subreddit (I apologize I am unaware of how to link while on mobile). TL;DR of that post is I had an ectopic pregnancy with my ex that ended up rupturing and caused internal bleeding/emergency surgery. That was many years ago and it was horrific and I still hurt so bad from the loss, I am glad I don't have to see my ex any longer. \n\nNow to the actual post: I have been married to my husband for over a year and have been wanting a baby since before we got married. I have always felt like it was my destiny to be a mother. I am turning 29 this year, and I want to at least try before I turn 30. My husband and I have had several discussions and he has always been keen on waiting. I was always upset, but he said in 2017 we can discuss it. We decided February to start trying/discuss when we will officially start trying. I was overjoyed! Now that it's a month away I have been feeling...terrified. first thing that I am terrified of is another loss. I only have one tube left and I am petrified of another ectopic and losing my one remaining tube. But the thing that is on my mind even more is...I'm almost embarrassed to say...that I will lose my \"life\". I enjoy going out to bars, reading for hours on end, going to the beach, going on road trips, and just generally doing what I want. I know I want a child but now that it's \"real\" I am so nervous. I feel like I am going crazy because I want a child but have these fears. I am mad at myself for being selfish and wanting to be \"free\" when I know I also want to have a child. \n\nSorry for the rambling, just needed to get it off my chest and possibly relate to someone.

Or seek support?\n\nI have a healthy, almost 7 month old daughter. Why would I even be trying again so close, correct?\n\nWell it started out when we got unexpectedly pregnant between 3 and 4 months postpartum. We had been doing a very cautious form of coitus interruptus, but apparently it wasn't enough. I even posted about it on reddit elsewhere because I was in such disbelief. We ended up losing the pregnancy around 7 weeks.\n\nWe made sure to use condoms, etc. the cycle after, and after then we thought -- well, maybe we'll go for it. We wanted our kids closer together for a variety of reasons, my now 6 month old daughter was taking to solids and already on the path to self-weaning, etc. So we tried. And we got pregnant. And it's now resulted in a chemical pregnancy.\n\nI know I have a healthy, living child. I know I am not in the trenches in the way some of all of you are. And I know I'm fortunate to have gotten pregnant so easily -- but it still hurts. That initial pregnancy was like an absolute sign to me because of so much that was going on at the time in my life... but then it was gone. Then to actually try after thinking I crossed my t's and dotted my i's and lose it is demoralizing.\n\nI've read that losing pregnancies isn't correlated with breastfeeding, or even proximity to last live birth -- that not ovulating is how the body shows it's not ready, not getting pregnant and being unable to carry it. My thyroid levels are different now than they were before I conceived my DD, but my endo didn't think they were off enough to be an issue and we're changing the pill I'm on there anyway.\n\nI don't know -- should I give up? IS it too soon, despite my body seemingly getting pregnant just by looking at my husband? Should I wait?

I read a few comments here and there that it's common for the first cycle to be strange and to experience cramping. Question is how do you differentiate between just a \"typical\" (whatever that means) post MC cycle versus a uterine infection?\n\nI had an early (5+weeks) natural MC about 4 weeks ago. I only bled for about 6 days and the cramping was only painful in the first day (I passed the biggest clots only a few hours into the cramping). My OB did an ultrasound on the 5th day of the bleeding and said that MC was completed and everything looked fine, she did however prescribe me a 3 day course antibiotic \"just in case, as a preventative measure.\" Well... I decided I know my body better and since the bleeding stopped one day later and I no longer had cramps or anything, I didn't take the antibiotic. \n\nWell... 1DPO (cycle day 15) I had terrible cramps. Really really painful. They felt a lot like the MC cramps, and they were definitely around my uterus area. They were so painful I took tylenol (which I very rarely do. I don't like painkillers). The cramping lasted 2 days and it went away. At that time I didn't know it was 1DPO and was freaking out. Then, a few days later, FF gave me crosshairs and I figured: well, it was 1DPO so maybe it was just ovulation cramps, made worse due to the MC...\n\nThen... 2 days ago (12DPO, cycle day 27) the cramps started again and are still going on. Except now, the pain isn't located around the uterus but higher, in the guts. It just feels like stomach bug + pre-period cramps (which for me is chills - I always have chills before my period arrives). However, no period. So, basically, I'm confused as to what the fuck is going on in my body. Is it just a 'normal' thing to experience post MC?\n\nAnother thing... because of the strange pain/cramping, I decided to do a urine dipstick test (I have a box of urinalysis sticks from something unrelated) and decided to check it out. Well, imagine my surprise when the urine test showed white blood cells present (there should be none) which indicates infection - usually a UTI (however I have no UTI symptoms whatsoever). Anyway, that's when I started getting worried. I tested again this morning and the white blood cells are still present but in lesser quantity. Cue in me looking into whether this could be something that happens in early pregnancy (why, yes, it could). But together with the cramps it definitely has me worried - and my DH this morning went: \"Oh shit.. remember the doc prescribed you antibiotics you never took.\" I had totally forgotten about it and now I'm freaking out about actually having a post MC infection and the painful cramps being a symptom of it. But if that was the case I'd had the painful cramps earlier, no?\n\nSorry for so much story, but I just have no idea what the hell to do. The soonest I can see my OB is Monday. I could go to a GP and they'd probably give me antibiotics for a UTI but they're usually clueless about stuff like MC and gyne stuff. On the other hand, if cramping post MC is 'normal' then I might just be freaking out for nothing. \n\n\nEDIT: One more question, if anyone on here was prescribed an antibiotic against a possible post MC infection, which antibiotic were you prescribed?

I am a newly 23 year old, going to grad school this fall. My boyfriend of 3 years lives in another state working on his first year of med school. We're long distance for at least 3 years. I did not at all have pregnancy on my mind until this week - I've had an IUD in place for 2 years. Long story short, Monday night I was in the ER having emergency surgery due to a rupturing of a surprise ectopic pregnancy. I lost my right Fallopian tube in the process, and due to timing I went through the whole thing - my first surgery - alone. Trying to look up support seems to focus more on the loss of the actual pregnancy which totally makes sense, but I'm trying to come to terms with the loss of the tube and what that could mean.\n\nIf you'd asked me before this, I would have told you an accidental pregnancy meant termination (I apologize if this is at all upsetting). My boyfriend and I had long agreed on this. Now I can't stop thinking about what I'll do if this event ever happens again since the chances are higher, if I lose the other tube... or if I have another \"normal\" accidental pregnancy, thinking if I terminated and later the first *planned* one caused the left tube to be lost... it's nothing but \"what if\"s but now they're all right in my face. Especially since there's a fair chance any future pregnancies could be with the same man as now. My boyfriend is being as supportive as possible seeing as he's been on a Hawaiian cruise for this whole thing and I won't see him until next Thursday. To a point though he can't fully understand why I'm as upset as I am, or why this is going to be on my mind for so long.\n\nI was doing what I considered to be the most reasonable thing to combat pregnancy having the IUD, and it failed me in a serious way. My body beat ridiculously low chances of even getting pregnant, only for it to then fail such that I am now going to spend the next however many years until I actively try terrified that it may not happen. I rationally know I can still get pregnant with 1 tube, and many women do not struggle albeit it perhaps taking longer. But others do, and I just don't know what'll happen. I am heartbroken to lose a piece of what feels like my womanhood, and I can't decide if that doesn't make sense. And now I have concerns about how my feelings in the event of a second unplanned pregnancy may possibly have changed. \n\nI'm not sure where I'm going with this. Mostly just looking for anyone who had an ectopic pregnancy end this way, and how the future panned out for them. The good and the bad. Or just how to categorize my thoughts to seem less scared. I'll take anything.

I was 13 weeks along and the baby was already showing major birth defects and growth problems, a clear indicator that it would likely not survive to full term. We consulted at length with a genetic counselor and doctor and decided to terminate the pregnancy. Part of me considered waiting until the baby died naturally but I decided it would be too painful given our history, past losses and ages (I'm 36, husband is 40). \n\nWe've been trying to have our first child for over four years and conceived this baby via IVF. I also had a miscarriage in Dec. 2013 (conceived naturally, MC at ~7 weeks) and an ectopic/pregnancy of unknown location in Dec. 2015 (conceived via medicated IUI). We were really hopeful that this pregnancy would work out since it was the farthest we'd ever gotten (13 weeks), but it wasn't meant to be.\n\nI had a D&amp;E yesterday and feel like I should feel more sad. Instead I'm just numb, almost like my mind is pretending nothing happened. Has anyone else felt this way? Part of it might be that I didn't allow myself to get too attached to the baby since we've already been through so much loss, and I wasn't showing yet so I kind of ignored the fact I was pregnant. I figured once we had the early scans and got confirmation that all was well, then I would let myself relax and try to enjoy the pregnancy and prepare for baby. \n\nRight now my mind is on how to move forward. I plan to make an appointment with my RE (reproductive endocrinologist) to discuss when we can start IVF again. Is it wrong to just focus on moving forward?

I need to stay at work and I need to stay quiet about it and I'm miserable, nauseous, and in pain, so I thought I'd come here. \n\nThis is my second loss, I guess, though I hadn't really counted the first one. The first one I didn't even find out that I was pregnant last summer until I was in the ER finding out that I had an ectopic, so I never got excited to start with. I guess that's why I didn't count it. But now that I'm losing another, it really feels like twice all of a sudden. \n\nThey never found my ectopic. So many ultrasounds and so much monitoring and a D and C and they just couldn't ever find out where the pregnancy was, so they just gave me the methotrexate. It made me really sick for a few days and then I went back in and I was still pregnant and they still didn't know where so I had to do it again. Fortunately it worked that time, after being even more sick for even longer, because next up would have been some scary exploratory surgery. \n\nI found out I was pregnant again last week and went in for immediate blood tests and the hcg more than doubled in two days that time and we instantly got excited. Then the cramping and spotting started today and so we did it again and the hcg cut in half, so I guess I'm just losing it. \n\nMy OB told me today that it might be better to wait a cycle before trying again but she understands if I want to try again immediately. See, my husband and I only have half the year each year to try. His work takes him away half the year each year and we don't want to have any babies during that time frame any year. \n\nSo we only have a few more months to try this year. \n\nIs it important, well we have better luck, if we do wait a cycle? \n\nThanks", "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "ttcafterloss", "subreddit_id": "t5_34scd", "suggested_sort": null, "thumbnail": "self", "title": "I guess I come here now?", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/ttcafterloss/comments/5nfhqn/i_guess_i_come_here_now/"}, {"author": "LJttc2016", "author_created_utc": 1478105173, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_text": null, "author_fullname": "t2_12jsd9", "brand_safe": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1484186165, "domain": "self.ttcafterloss", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/ttcafterloss/comments/5ngi4l/suffered_a_miscarriage_finds_out_sil_is_pregnant/", "gilded": 0, "id": "5ngi4l", "is_self": true, "locked": false, "media_embed": {}, "num_comments": 7, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/ttcafterloss/comments/5ngi4l/suffered_a_miscarriage_finds_out_sil_is_pregnant/", "retrieved_on": 1489425856, "score": 10, "secure_media_embed": {}, "selftext": "I'm back to reddit after a much needed break. The last time I posted, I was over-the-moon happy because we got our BFP. First faint line was 7 DPO, and had my first positive digital at 12 DPO. This was around Thanksgiving, and I felt so unbelievably lucky to have it happen on our first real month of ttc-ing.\n\nOur due date was on our 1 year wedding anniversary, which was really special for us, even though the likelihood of the baby being born on that actual day was low. I scheduled my appointment with my OB for my first ultrasound for 9 weeks. It felt like forever away and I wasn't sure that I could make it that long without knowing anything about my baby. I asked if they would do a blood test to see where my levels were at and they declined. They said it was not necessary for someone who has never had a miscarriage or complicated pregnancy before. I felt okay and both my husband and I were positive that everything would be alright. I started having pregnancy symptoms, didn't get a period or have any bleeding so I did not have any second thought that something was wrong. One morning I woke up and decided to take a line test just to make sure that it was continuing to get darker. There was hardly a line at all. I called my OB office and asked what I should do, I felt like I was freaking out over nothing (my husband probably thought I was nuts) but I seriously had a feeling that I was losing the baby. I went in for HCG blood draw. The next day I was driving to work and the nurse calls me, she tells me that unfortunately my HCG is only 36. Way too low for where I needed to be at this point. She tells me to go in the following day and we would see where my levels are before determining whether or not it would be a viable pregnancy. I do, and my HCG is 40. Even though it went up slightly, she confirms that I was going to miscarry. I was so heartbroken. I have never felt so lost in my entire life. \n\nA week goes by, and I have no cramping or bleeding. Doctor is concerned that it may be an ectopic pregnancy. HCG is hanging around the same 30-ish area, so he decides I need an ultrasound ASAP. I go in, they confirm my miscarriage at 6 weeks 3 days. Luckily, it's not an ectopic and the overall health of my reproductive system is \"very good\" and exactly what they would like for it to look like at my age. My OB says that my body likely is going so absorb the embryo since I was so early. No explanation of what happened, that it was just random. \n\nFast forward a few weeks, I was still in a lot of pain emotionally, but I was starting to get back into the swing of things and feeling somewhat normal. I log into Facebook and see a baby announcement from my husband's best friend and wife, their baby due the same week that ours would be. I lost it. Not upset because they are expecting, I am happy for them... but it was the day that we were scheduled for our first ultrasound, so for some reason it just hurt. I screenshot the announcement and send it to my husband and my mom, just saying how I can't stand seeing these announcements right now--they make me too upset and I feel like a huge bitch for feeling that way. My husband comes home, he's hurt too--he said it just felt like a punch in the gut to find out that they were expecting on the internet and that our babies would be only a week apart. Not even 2 minutes after my hubby comes home, my mom facetimes me and says she needs to tell us something and we need to be calm. My brother and his wife are expecting their 1st child--they have known for a long time--everyone else in the family already knows-- she is 5 months pregnant. They were planning on telling us in person a few days later when we went to their house that is 2.5 hours away... I know they were just trying to be considerate of our feelings. They will be the best parents, and we are excited to have a niece or nephew-- but we are broken... and I think that's a valid feeling. When we went to their house, they talked a lot about their baby-- my SIL asks when we are going to try again, and says maybe if I don't stress out as much this time then everything will be okay. \n\nMy cycle is all messed up. We are going to try again. I just ordered ovulation tests so that I can start tracking my cycle and get back on track. Thanks for reading, I haven't talked to hardly anyone about any of this. I just needed to get this off my chest. I am willing to talk if anyone else is going through a rough time TTC after loss, don't hesitate to reach out. \n", "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "ttcafterloss", "subreddit_id": "t5_34scd", "suggested_sort": null, "thumbnail": "self", "title": "suffered a miscarriage, finds out SIL is pregnant and has been hiding it.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/ttcafterloss/comments/5ngi4l/suffered_a_miscarriage_finds_out_sil_is_pregnant/"}, {"author": "AutoModerator", "author_created_utc": 1325741068, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_text": null, "author_fullname": "t2_6l4z3", "brand_safe": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1484204801, "distinguished": "moderator", "domain": "self.ttcafterloss", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/ttcafterloss/comments/5nhzee/ttcafterloss_ttc_daily_discussion_thread_january/", "gilded": 0, "id": "5nhzee", "is_self": true, "link_flair_css_class": "ttc", "link_flair_text": "TTC Thread", "locked": false, "media_embed": {}, "num_comments": 58, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/ttcafterloss/comments/5nhzee/ttcafterloss_ttc_daily_discussion_thread_january/", "retrieved_on": 1489426584, "score": 2, "secure_media_embed": {}, "selftext": "**This thread is for members who are TTC or waiting to try.

Discussion in this thread is allowed, too, but only answers in the survey will be collected/shared.\n\n[See the results here](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScT6yoobiuDxU6tQuhrzC32Yd_o3ca3VpvfivrRaPbVrJk_dQ/viewanalytics)\n\nIf you ask a question \"for the members of the sub\", we'll do a stickied question later on for each one to try to compile answers for people. :) \n\nThanks to u/RubyRedByrd and u/nutella47 for suggesting this and compiling questions!", "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "ttcafterloss", "subreddit_id": "t5_34scd", "suggested_sort": null, "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Repeat Loss Survey", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/ttcafterloss/comments/5nlfiu/repeat_loss_survey/"}, {"author": "rainbowbabyresearch", "author_created_utc": 1484252206, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_text": null, "author_fullname": "t2_14dt7t", "brand_safe": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1484254819, "domain": "self.ttcafterloss", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/ttcafterloss/comments/5nlze0/rainbow_pregnancy_a_journey_to_motherhood/", "gilded": 0, "id": "5nlze0", "is_self": true, "locked": false, "media_embed": {}, "num_comments": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/ttcafterloss/comments/5nlze0/rainbow_pregnancy_a_journey_to_motherhood/", "retrieved_on": 1489428558, "score": 5, "secure_media_embed": {}, "selftext": "[removed]", "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "ttcafterloss", "subreddit_id": "t5_34scd", "suggested_sort": null, "thumbnail": "default", "title": "Rainbow Pregnancy: A Journey to Motherhood (Anonymous Survey)", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/ttcafterloss/comments/5nlze0/rainbow_pregnancy_a_journey_to_motherhood/"}]}
