It was my second miscarriage, the first was spontaneous and no testing could be done. I asked if the hospital could do any tests on my baby's remains to try and figure out what had caused the miscarriage. They arranged to do chromosomal testing but said it was unlikely that they could tell us what happened. On Saturday, we saw our doctor and she gave us the results - our baby had Down Syndrome and had stopped growing at 8w2d. She is said the DS may have been just a random thing and it happens more frequently in older mums (I just turned 38) or we could do testing to see if DP and I are at risk of having another baby with DS. Has anyone had this kind of testing done? I am really unsure about whether to go ahead or just hope for the best in the future.

Prior to pregnancy/CP #2, the ladies at TFAB suggested I go in and get my progesterone tested because I have a 11 day LP, spotting around 8DPO+, and had had one previous CP. I made an appointment to discuss/order a day 21 test and boom! It turned out I was pregnant. I got my BFP that day. We did a beta confirmation blood draw that I thought was going to have progesterone but didn't so no results from that time. I also asked them to please prescribe progesterone because of my suspicions, which they did. Once I was on progesterone the spotting stopped. I stayed pregnant for about 10 days and then lost it. \n\nAfter that, I asked them if we could still do the progesterone test this month, and so I went in last Friday (7DPO, which is nowhere near CD21 for me ever, but w/e) for that test. I got a call and they told me it's low - 5.7. She advised I get back on my leftover progesterone from last pregnancy for now since we were trying again this month.\n\n**Now -**\n\nI've sent some medical questions to the midwife, so I'm not here seeking medical advice as much as people's own experiences. \n\n- How low is 5.7? Is that really low? Kinda low?\n- What else can I do? The midwife said diet/exercise doesn't really affect progesterone. \n- What other tests might be relevant for me? I was at a regular OBGYN/midwife practice, but does this mean it's time to go to a fertility specialist? \n- Just... now what? \n\n**Can anyone who has had experience with this give me a run down of what you did next?**\n\nThank you :)", "stickied": false, "subreddit": "ttcafterloss", "subreddit_id": "t5_34scd", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "So my 21 day progesterone level was 5.7... now what?", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/ttcafterloss/comments/53iofl/so_my_21_day_progesterone_level_was_57_now_what/"}, {"author": "booze_and_hotpants", "author_created_utc": 1337657069, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_text": null, "author_fullname": "t2_7s0de", "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1474307542, "domain": "self.ttcafterloss", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/ttcafterloss/comments/53itrz/is_anyone_else_ttc_immediately_following_a_loss/", "gilded": 0, "id": "53itrz", "is_self": true, "link_flair_css_class": "question", "link_flair_text": "Question", "locked": false, "media_embed": {}, "num_comments": 27, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/ttcafterloss/comments/53itrz/is_anyone_else_ttc_immediately_following_a_loss/", "retrieved_on": 1476433744, "score": 8, "secure_media_embed": {}, "selftext": "Hey everyone, the first day of my miscarriage was September 2 and I bled normally for a week (almost identical to a period) and it was finished.

My OB (the one who delivered my son) took a week to get back to me to follow up with results from blood work I have had done. And now she's sending me for more blood work (apparently my prolactin was super high and so now she wants a fasting prolactin - let me tell you - it's high because I just had a baby and I'm still making milk). I must have called the office four times after I already saw on my insurance website that the results were in.\n\nI feel like after a loss, I need an office that will get back in touch with me promptly. I called up another OB that I had seen a few years ago but decided against because she's in a group with 10 other doctors and it seemed like an overwhelmingly large practice. Her academic credentials are the best I've seen for my city though. The scheduling line had to forward a message to another scheduling line and the very nice lady on the phone said that she was leaving them a note explaining my whole situation so that they would call me ASAP. I called this morning and they didn't call me back all day.\n\nShould I just keep calling practices until someone returns my calls in a reasonable time frame? For me a reasonable time frame is sometime the same day. I know that if I were to get pregnant again, I'd want someone to call me back that day if I had questions (I'm not a total nut - I just mean if I call in the morning of a work day and leave a message, I want someone to get back to me before they close for the day). I work in healthcare, in a couple of different busy offices and we return calls very quickly so I know it can be done. I also want a doctor that is close to my house because I want to know I can come in quickly if I'm freaking out and need reassurance. The MFM said I'll be going 3x/week in the third trimester anyway.\n\nAnyone else had a hard time finding a doctor to guide them through a pregnancy after a loss?

This is our 2nd loss after a CP last year. We plan to try again as soon as we can and luckily don't seem to have problems getting pregnant, just staying pregnant. : / \n\nBut looking back at this pregnancy, I feel like there were some things that could have been done differently or should have been taken more seriously. First, I went to the ER at 6w2d due to severe cramping. I was diagnosed with a subchorionic hemorrhage and a bicornuate uterus, after a hell in which they used the term \"cornuate pregnancy\" and the nurses interpreted it as an ectopic and I was scared to death. \n\nNo one seemed to think this was a big deal. My best friend did research and got pretty freaked out by whatever she found but since my Dr. didn't want to see me sooner, I figured it was fine. After all, most SCH heal on their own. \n\nBut now, after the testing has come back and the baby had no genetic issues or chromosomal abnornalities and my Dr. Is saying the most likely explanation is placental abruption due to my uterine anomaly, I am looking at it differently. With a bicornuate uterus, I am more at risk for placental abruption at baseline. And having SCH increases that risk and can be a precursor to placental abruption. And bedrest is generally, while iffy, the only thing that even might prevent it. \n\nI feel angry, like my situation was blown off and not addressed properly. But more than that, I am determined that it not happen again if anything can be done to stop it. I want to ask for far more frequent ultrasounds and even ask about bedrest if any severe cramping occurs. At the time the SCH was diagnosed and even a week later, the baby was growing and had a strong heartbeat, but I was working a high stress job in which I am on my feet a lot due to client demands. I can't help wondering if bedrest COULD have saved my baby, and if there is even a chance it could prevent this again in the future I want to do it. How do I address this with my DR?

It should be noted that any other brand's test I took in the last day or so were all stone cold negative, so I believe there's no chance this was a chemical pregnancy. \n\nNow, enough of you experienced wonderful women might already know of this issue with FRER tests. I'm pretty new to TTC and the case of Early Testing Syndrome in the dreaded TWW. I assumed because of FRER's super sensitivity that they were considered the gold standard for early testing. Maybe I just didn't do enough research ahead of time, but I don't feel like I should *have* to research something like this. In any case, I just wanted to pass along the info in the hopes it might help someone else out. \n\nNow that I've been completely disenfranchised by these expensive pieces of crap, I won't use them anymore. This has also been a good lesson for me about the detriment of testing too early, and the case for false hope and misinterpreting shitty tests. I'm not saying one shouldn't be hopeful and optimistic during the TWW, but one place that should be as black and white as possible is home pregnancy tests. So, maybe think twice before using these next time you're getting an itch to test early. Lots of love to you all!

Still working hard on couch to 5k and I'm going to register for a turkey trot 5k to do on Thanksgiving. I think I might start to TTC after that, if I ever get my period again or get my doctor to call me back about taking medication so I can get my period again.

He was incredibly patient, listened to my concerns and questions and validated them, and we made a proactive plan. \n\nFirst, and most vindicating, he did say that the SCH should probably have been taken more seriously, as although 2/3 of women have them heal on their own, I am more at risk for abruption due to my uterine anomaly. He said the evidence on bed rest for preventing abruption after a SCH is weak, but that bed rest certainly won't hurt and can be very comforting in that \"I did everything I could\" way. I told him that I know bed rest isn't fun, but fortunately my work offers good STD benefits and my husband and I can afford for me to do bed-rest (it will be really tight but I have run the numbers), so if the severe cramping happens or an SCH is found I would like to do at least modified bed-rest next time.\n\nHe is scheduling me for an MRI to determine whether my uterus is septate or bicornuate. If septate, we will do surgery. Apparently there IS a surgical option for a bicornuate uterus but it is intensive and has risks of uterine rupture or scar tissue. So I probably wouldn't do it if that is the case. \n\nWe are also planning biweekly ultrasounds at minimum until 18-20 weeks in the next pregnancy, and weekly ultrasounds if any SCH or bleeding are found. He made sure to say that this won't prevent anything, which I know, but not knowing my baby was dead for 3 weeks really messed with me. \n\nOverall, I feel really good about the appointment. I feel like I am being taken seriously, and like my doctor is on board with doing everything we can to prevent more losses. Obviously, I am still a higher risk for miscarriage and all of these precautions won't necessarily stop it, but being proactive feels better. Unfortunately I found out I owe his office $400 for the D&amp;C, which brings the total cost up to about $2500 so far and I haven't even gotten the anesthesiologist's bill so that's going to be fun.

It was basically an exact repeat of the last scan except now I got the bad news a month earlier. There was a well shaped sac in the uterus, and a small embryo measuring 6+0, no heartbeat (I am actually 7+3, confirmed ovulation with temping and OPK, BFP at 9 DPO). Mathematically there is no way I'm 6+0. They gave me the speech they are obligated to about how it could be too early to see, I need to come back in a week to check. But I know how it's gonna go. This isn't my first rodeo. \n\nStatistically speaking, the chance of 2 consecutive missed miscarriages is .01%. That is where I find myself now. I feel broken. I feel like it *has* to be a problem with me, because my eggs and my body are the only common denominator (I even live in a different state, with a different job in a different field, and different pets. Literally everything is different but me). I hate that I have to wait around in limbo for another week just to be told what I already know is coming. Right now I hate my husbands shitty optimism--he literally just came in the room and told me he read stories on the Internet where people when in for a 7w scan, saw and empty sac, and then saw a healthy baby the next week at their follow up. Yeah, those people probably had irregular cycles or didn't know when they actually ovulated. Knock that shit off, I don't need your false hope. I hate the realization that I will *never* have a pregnancy that I just enjoy. No matter how they turn out they will all feel like a terrible mindfuck until I am actually holding a baby (if it ever even happens). I just want to get my D&amp;C (which I know I'll need based on my last MMC) and get it over with. \n\nSo that's my rant for the day. Now I get to go try and explain this shit show to my boss, because I will need to go back for the confirmation ultrasound next week and getting time off is damn near impossible. \n", "stickied": false, "subreddit": "ttcafterloss", "subreddit_id": "t5_34scd", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Second Consecutive Missed Miscarriage--Feeling Broken", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/ttcafterloss/comments/53zui3/second_consecutive_missed_miscarriagefeeling/"}, {"author": "channelfrida", "author_created_utc": 1472603738, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_text": null, "author_fullname": "t2_1117af", "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1474575761, "domain": "self.ttcafterloss", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/ttcafterloss/comments/54105s/triggered_by_upcoming_holidays/", "gilded": 0, "id": "54105s", "is_self": true, "link_flair_css_class": "vent", "link_flair_text": "Vent", "locked": false, "media_embed": {}, "num_comments": 24, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/ttcafterloss/comments/54105s/triggered_by_upcoming_holidays/", "retrieved_on": 1476443092, "score": 9, "secure_media_embed": {}, "selftext": "I've been feeling pretty okay considering I'm healing from my 3rd miscarriage this year.

The gestational sac had been growing the whole time but there was no embryo or yolk sac. The bleeding quickly got much lighter, like within an hour of it starting, and there were never any clots.  Now I haven't had any bleeding at all today or yesterday, and never had any cramping.  I know the doctor said it could take a couple weeks for the miscarriage to complete naturally, but now it seems like it has completely stopped.  I don't remember if he had said anything about that being a possibility.  Is this normal?  I would like to avoid a medical procedure, but I don't want this to drag on forever as we are eager and hopeful to try again.  I guess I should probably just wait the 2 weeks as the doctor had suggested before considering other options, but I just want to know if others have had similar experiences.

Mid-August at my 9 week appointment and first ultrasound of the pregnancy, I learned that my baby no longer had a heart beat. This was especially devastating as I had suffered the exact same scenario with a previous pregnancy at my 8 week appointment in March. [Original Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/ttcafterloss/comments/4y3mo4/i_tried_so_hard_to_be_optimistic_but_my_fears/)\n\nThese two losses in a row has been the hardest trial of my life so far and it has been impossible for me not to feel extreme bouts of anxiety, guilt, and regret though I really didn't think there was much I could have changed. I'm also frustrated at the wasted time slipping away as I would be almost due with my first pregnancy had it worked out and really hoped to be pregnant again by this point as I had envisioned a certain gap in age between my daughter and her sibling. So much for trying to get life to conform to my plans...\n\nI had a panel of blood tests done, but everything has come back normal. About 3 weeks after my D&amp;C the doctor called with the results of the fetal tissue analysis. I was surprised to learn that the baby had tested positive for a chromosomal anomaly, non-translocation Trisomy 21 (Down's Syndrome). I was also surprised at how much of an immediate relief it was to suddenly have a good explanation for the loss of my pregnancy (up to 80% of DS pregnancies spontaneously abort) as I didn't have any testing done after my first loss. Given some time to reflect, I am now relieved that I lost the baby naturally so my husband and I did not have to face the decision whether or not to medically terminate the pregnancy at a later date.\n\nSo now we are starting over, again. I'm hoping to be pregnant again right away, but so discouraged going through the TTC process for the third time. I bled lightly for a few days after my D&amp;C, then had another bout of bleeding a week and a half later, and then I had what I considered to be my period almost 4 weeks after my D&amp;C on September 10th (pregnancy tests were finally negative). Now, exactly two weeks later on the date I would expect to ovulate normally, I am getting cramping, back pain, sore breasts, and brownish spotting. This is not normal for me so I am wondering if I might be having another period which is discouraging as we were going to restart TTC this round. I didn't have the chance to test today, but OPK strips the last few days have been negative.

I need to be able to talk about everything I'm going through.\n\nI did look into finding a therapist, but I don't have money for that. I was hospitalized during my miscarriage, so I'm already paying some crazy medical bills. The medical bills, as a matter of fact, were what sent me into crying mess. I can't afford to pay them all right now, so I set up payment plans for them. And with every payment I'm reminded of everything all over again and I bawl my eyes out.\n\nSo here I am on Reddit. I had no idea there was a subreddit on miscarriage and loss, but I don't know where else to go.\n\nIs anyone else feeling they don't have anyone to talk to and can't move on?\n", "stickied": false, "subreddit": "ttcafterloss", "subreddit_id": "t5_34scd", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "I need to Share", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/ttcafterloss/comments/54u44h/i_need_to_share/"}, {"author": "AutoModerator", "author_created_utc": 1325741068, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_text": null, "author_fullname": "t2_6l4z3", "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1475046238, "distinguished": "moderator", "domain": "self.ttcafterloss", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/ttcafterloss/comments/54v628/ttcafterloss_ttc_daily_discussion_thread/", "gilded": 0, "id": "54v628", "is_self": true, "link_flair_css_class": "ttc", "link_flair_text": "TTC Thread", "locked": false, "media_embed": {}, "num_comments": 56, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/ttcafterloss/comments/54v628/ttcafterloss_ttc_daily_discussion_thread/", "retrieved_on": 1476459015, "score": 3, "secure_media_embed": {}, "selftext": "**This thread is for members who are TTC or waiting to try.

How kind, such things are truly appreciated by people in their time of grief!\n\nHowever, sometimes the most well meaning of words that are intended to provide comfort or solace can in fact cause more upset to the grieving person during an already difficult time. This friendly guide is intended to show people some of the things that are helpful to grieving people in times of loss and also, more importantly, some of the not so helpful things that should be avoided.\n\nLet's start with the Do's since the list is smaller.\n\n**Do**\n\n* Say \"I'm so, so sorry for your loss.\"\n\n* Let the family know your thoughts are with them.\n\n* Offer to bring meals to the family, or send food cards to anyone close to you that suffers a loss. They won't be thinking about cooking and easy to heat up and eat meals are a godsend!\n\n* If you have suffered a pregnancy loss (Note: pet loss should not be compared to child loss), it's OK to share your experiences of surviving that time in a way that lets the person know they can survive it too. (Note: take care not to say that you understand what the person is going through, every loss is a different experience and is a unique devastation to that person.)\n\n* Ask what the grieving person wants and needs. Some grieving people don't consider themselves parents after loss, some do. Some like to be hugged, some don't. Some may want to talk on the phone or text about their feelings and thoughts, while others want to be given space for a brief period, or longer.\n\n* Give the grieving person space to grieve however they need to without judgement, they may have periods of anger or bitterness, or perhaps appear withdrawn, and that's OK.\n\n\n**Don't**\n\n* Tell the person how upsetting or sad *their* loss is hard for *you* to hear. Support only.\n\n* Use the hope for a future pregnancy as any consolation for the death of a baby. \"Hope to see you back in /r/babybumps soon!\" is not appropriate when someone is actively mourning and yearning for the specific baby that they just lost, not just any baby. Future pregnancies do not diminish the pain and loss of a baby that has died.\n\n* Make any religious comments. Don't assume the person finds comfort from words such as: \"God needed another angel.\" \"S/he wasn't meant to be.\" Even the most religious people don't want to hear these things in their time of deepest grief, few people find comfort from these words and many more are caused hurt by these words.\n\n* Assume the baby died because there was \"something wrong with the baby.\" or that it was \"natures way\".\n\n* Set a timeline for the grieving person to be done grieving. People are often surprised when a person isn't \"back to themselves\" after a few weeks or months. \n\n* Tell the grieving person what they should or need to do following their loss.\n\n* Use \"at least\" or try to offer any consolation to the situation. The grieving person isn't looking for you to make things better, nothing can make the situation better but your support and presence can aid the person through that time.\n\n* Offer the grieving person your children in jest (yes, this happens...a lot). Or suggest that children are in anyway a nightmare and the person is better off for their baby dying.\n\n* Ask why the baby died. It comes across as being nosy and looking for the grieving person to comfort you that what happened to them won't happen to you and your baby. They can't and won't give you that assurance.\n\n* Ask the grieving person what they could have done to have caused or prevented the loss.)\n\n* Say that you can't imagine what they are going through. To a person who has no choice but to live that loss daily, it doesn't help that they have to survive something that other people can't (or won't) even think about.\n\n* Say \"at least you know you can get pregnant.\" \n\n\n**Words from our /r/ttcafterloss family**\n\n\"A few of the most hurtful things I have heard:\n*You'll be a mother one day (I am a mother I cared for my baby as long as he was in my womb)\n*Everything happens for a reason (there's no reason for this, and personally I think it insinuates that I deserved this kind of pain)\n*Don't be sad, he wouldn't have wanted you to be sad (I'm grieving and no one can tell me how I can or cannot grieve)\n*When you have a child.. (boss referring to going on mat leave)\n*Time to move on (honestly I'll never move on, I may cope better)\n*You've had time to heal and now it's time to get back to normal life (my heart will always be broken)\nI know in my heart that people mean well but those 'comforting' words/sayings hurt. The only real words of comfort are 'I'm sorry for your loss' and a private hug. Or even just a hug and no words. I appreciated the hug when I went back to work, I wasn't ready to talk about it but my coworker gave me a hug. If you've also suffered a loss I appreciate when the stories are shared of your loss, it's nice to know you're not alone when it feels like your world is crushed.\nOne other thing that meant the world to me is when someone knew my baby's name (Mackenzie) and they would use his name. It makes me feel good that his name is being used, it gives me a small sense of peace that he won't be forgotten.\nAlso, if you are friends or family with someone who suffered a loss, just be understanding that there are good days and awful days. Understand that if they make plans with you and are having an awful day, don't hold it against them if they decide last minute that they don't want to go out or see anyone. And especially if you are expecting. There are two people who are expecting in my husband's family and I've been avoiding them since my loss a few months ago. It just hurts to be reminded of what I've lost. I hurt enough without the reminder. But if they are still hanging out then just be thoughtful and don't talk only about your pregnancy or children.\nShortly after our loss the in laws would not stop talking about their grandchildren, and it hurt so much because there will never be a time when they talk about my baby. I loved him just as much as anyone loves their child. But he's gone now and only my husband and I will probably ever talk about him now. And it breaks my heart.\" - anonymous ttcafterloss redditor\n\n\n\n\n\"Has anyone seen this video about the difference between sympathy and empathy? (TW: Mentions Miscarriage briefly). I think it perfectly expresses what everyone is talking about here. We want empathy and sympathy just makes us feeling worse, more alone, or if you are me homicidally angry. Here is the link (video in the article): http://www.karmatube.org/videos.php?id=4646 \" - anonymous ttcafterloss redditor\n\n\n\n\n\"Mother with multiple losses here. One of the kindest things anyone did for me after the miscarriages was to tell me she was pregnant via email, not in person. It gave me the chance to process her news in private (our due dates would have been just a few weeks apart) without having to react on the spot.\" - anonymous ttcafterloss redditor\n\n\n\n\n\"I wanted to share a very negative experience, with some of the most hurtful comments I have heard. I had a TFMR at 14 weeks. I did not keep it to myself but I shared what happened at work to explain my absence and also to acknowledge what happened. A colleague did not get the fact I was grieving. And she didn't mind interrogating me about it. She told me (and yes this was all one traumatic conversation):\nhow I couldn't have been attached since I was only 14 weeks and did not feel it kick yet\nthat she also had a miscarriage (not the same lady!) but that she wasn't phased at all because baby was probably not healthy, like mine, and sure she was crampy, but she showed up to work the next day regardless of the physical pain\nthat she knew people that lost a full term healthy baby and of course that was very sad\nthat this was so unlike the person she thought I was, a strong person\nIt took me, quite literally, a week to stop shaking and crying after this conversation.\" - anonymous ttcafterloss reditor\n\n\n\n\n\"Heres my 2 cents...\nSome DON'Ts\nDo NOT tell them, no matter your religious affiliation or theirs, that this \u201chappened for a reason.\u201d (No reason seems ok when you\u2019re grieving. No reason IS \u201cok\u201d)\nDo NOT tell them \u201cit will happen when the time is right.\u201d (Um I just had a baby die, think about it)\nDo NOT tell them \u201cat least you can try again.\u201d\nDo NOT tell them \u201cat least you weren\u2019t further along.\u201d (I haven\u2019t had a late term loss or a still birth\u2026that\u2019s another aspect I can\u2019t even fathom, but an early loss doesn\u2019t diminish my pain)\nDo NOT tell them \u201cIt wasn\u2019t a baby yet.\u201d (I don\u2019t care if you believe that, it was my baby. I\u2019m sad. That\u2019s a BS statement) *Do NOT tell them \u201cat least you didn\u2019t meet him then lose him.\u201d (Do I need to point out why this is bad?)\nDo NOT tell them \u201cit will happen for you, I know it.\u201d (Because you do not know it)\nDo NOT tell them \u201cmaybe you should stop trying if you get this upset.\u201d (Just ugh)\nAnd for DO's\nDO tell them you\u2019re sorry for their loss.\nDO ask if they need anything, and let them know you\u2019re there if/when they decide that they do.\nDO just LISTEN (and let them know you are there to just listen)\nDO validate their feelings. They are grieving. It\u2019s real.\nDO understand it takes time and grief is a process\u2026they won\u2019t just be over it on some set timeline.\" /u/therealamberrose\n\n\n\n\"The comments that bugged me the most (followed by my bitter internal responses):\nAt least you know you can get pregnant now (Yeah, I know. Staying pregnant is the problem)\nIt is just part of the process (NO IT ISN'T)\nIt just isn't the right time for you (I'm glad you have such a knowledge of when things are right for my life)\nHave patience (Yes, I'm sure being patient will fix everything about this)\nI honestly hated most advice that people tried to give me, and really appreciated when it was kept simple. \"That's terrible, I'm so sorry for your loss and I'm there if you need me.\" I wasn't in search of advice from people, and most of the time, it was hard to talk about.\nI think a big part of talking to someone after she's experienced a loss (or a male partner as well) is to take their cues. If they don't continue the conversation on it or seem uncomfortable, don't grasp for trite sayings; leave it alone. If they open up the conversation, let them talk and you can be a listening ear.\" - anonymous ttcafterloss redditor\n\n\n\n\n\n\"I also think its important to ask women how they want to refer to their experience. I don't like being called a mother, as I don't feel I was one. I did not want acknowledgement on Mothers Day, though many women do. I don't like referring to my pregnancy as my \"baby\" because, to me, it wasnt. I was pregnant and then I was not. Because I am not open about my TFMR in real life &amp; people think it was a miscarriage, I prefer the phrase \"lost pregnancy\" or \"my loss\". I know this is so, so different than how many women feel in this sub, so I feel it should be mentioned. We dont all feel the same way, so asking someone how they prefer the experience to be referred to is important, I think.\" - anonymous ttcafterloss redditor\n\n\n\n\n\n\"The most helpful and comforting words I've received are when people mention my son by name, or tell me they're thinking of him. His name is like music to my ears. Of course it's appreciated when people say they're thinking of or praying for my husband and me, but when people remember there was another real person involved, it means the most.\" - anonymous ttcafterloss redditor", "stickied": false, "subreddit": "ttcafterloss", "subreddit_id": "t5_34scd", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Come screen this /r/babybumps etiquette post for me please guys", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/ttcafterloss/comments/54xo7u/come_screen_this_rbabybumps_etiquette_post_for_me/"}, {"author": "MrsShort", "author_created_utc": 1400094371, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_text": null, "author_fullname": "t2_gkf4v", "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1475095231, "domain": "self.ttcafterloss", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/ttcafterloss/comments/54yidc/not_sure_when_to_start/", "gilded": 0, "id": "54yidc", "is_self": true, "link_flair_css_class": "question", "link_flair_text": "Question", "locked": false, "media_embed": {}, "num_comments": 8, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/ttcafterloss/comments/54yidc/not_sure_when_to_start/", "retrieved_on": 1476460857, "score": 6, "secure_media_embed": {}, "selftext": "I had a MM @ 8.5 weeks, found out at 10 weeks, D&amp;C @ 11 weeks, and today, 2.5 weeks after the d&amp;c I took a pregnancy test and it was negative!

(sorry in advance for any and all grammar/spelling errors, english is not my first language!)\n\n  \nI've been lurking here since my second loss (a MMC) in June, and it has been incredibly healing reading all your stories, and finally finding others than you can relate to.\n\n   \nMy story is, I think, pretty typical. Me and my husband started trying a year ago this   month (can't freakin believe it has been a year already, gah!) and at first we were   SOO exited, because, you know, we were going to be parents soon - right!? Wrong.   On the seventh month of trying we finally got our first BFP, and we were so happy.   A few days later I lost it and we learned CP's is a thing. The next month we got lucky   again, but the anxiety had really gripped me this time around. What if we lost it   again? But the weeks rolled by and everything seemed to be going well. I didn't have   a lot of symptoms (only swollen breasts and fatigue) but hey - lucky me!   \nWe started to tell our closest family, and also learned my husbands brother and his   GF were expecting, we were due only two weeks apart. That was such a cool feeling,   having someone to go through it all with. At 11w0d I started to have the most   minimal pink spotting, and two days later I started bleeding for real. The MMC was confirmed via ultrasound at the ER - and the days that followed are some of the most   painful (both emotionally and physically) I've ever experienced. Ended up having a   D&amp;C while awake, and the doctors and nurses were so amazing that it didn't feel so scary.\n\n\nAnd now I'm here, two \"real\" cycles after my MMC, trying to get pregnant again.   The process is stressful, and I feel really jaded. I miss the first happy, innocent   months of TTC, before I had these experiences, when I still thought miscarriages was   something that wouldn't (couldn't) happen to me.

So...just to put that out there. \n\nToday is my first day back at work after my natural mc on Monday. I'm still bleeding, and it's really on and off. It will seem to be nearly gone for a few hours and then I'll get a big gush and need to change my pad. I work a very unusual job (so I don't want to give a ton of detail and doxx myself), but I work in operating rooms, and we work independently so there is only ever one of us there at a time (unless there are two surgeons working at the same time who both want our services). That boils down to: if the patient is in the room, we are in the room. No breaks. No leaving. Most surgeries only run a few hours and it's not a big deal (although it's not uncommon for us to cover multiple surgeries a day and end up working something ridiculous like 16 hours straight). But then there's days like today...\n\nLast night someone asks if I can cover a surgery that should just take a few hours. Perfect, I'm happy to do it and I think this is a great \"re introduction\" back into work. Then my boss tells me there is another surgery, a big one, with a notoriously slow surgeon going right after that, so I'll just stay for that too. This surgery with this surgeon has the potential to run 7-8 hours or longer. Normally, that setup would be standard protocol. I'm hesitant but we had 3 people (basically half our staff) out on unexpected leave this week and everyone has been slammed. I hang up the phone and call a coworker (who also knows about the loss). Let them know I am so anxious that I'm going to be in the middle of a case and suddenly bleed through my undies and scrubs, and it's suddenly gonna be like \"oh shit\". He encouraged me to call my boss back and tell him that, because it's a pretty critical piece of info. \n\nI begrudgingly do, and it's so embarrassing. Which is even weirder for me, because I am generally an open-book-no-shame-about-bodily-functions sort of person. I can tell my boss is frustrated, and he's he wants to know when I am going to be able to go our \"normal\" long breakless stretches again, like, when can I go back to sitting in an OR 8 hours and not need a bathroom break. I tell him my honest answer: I don't know. There is no way for me to speed this process up or know how long it will take. It could stop tomorrow or this weekend or in two weeks. \n\nSo at this point I'm like ugly crying and an emotional mess. We find a resolution that works and all is fine. But having to tell my boss I basically couldn't do my job because I'm worried about bleeding through a pad was *the worst*. I'm so ready for this bleeding to stop so that so many different parts of my life can go back to some semblance of normal.", "stickied": false, "subreddit": "ttcafterloss", "subreddit_id": "t5_34scd", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Had to tell my (male) boss that I would prefer a schedule change because I'm still bleeding.

I flew home to take care of her.\n--I found out I was pregnant.\n--My mom got a bad infection from the surgery and almost died. She was in the ICU for a week. I flew home again to take care of her.\n--I had a miscarriage.\n\nSo here I am now. New city, no job, and no baby. \n\nMy husband and I would like to start trying again right away, but we're also just trying to catch up to all the crazy stuff we've been through recently. None of my friends have kids, and while they've been the most supportive, loving friends anyone could ask for, they don't really get why I'm so upset, and have been saying a lot of the stuff I'm sure you guys have heard too about how there will be other babies, and it'll happen soon, etc.\n\nAnyways, just wanted to introduce myself and try to have more of a community around me who gets what this feels like without my having to explain it over and over again.\n\nThanks for listening/reading.
