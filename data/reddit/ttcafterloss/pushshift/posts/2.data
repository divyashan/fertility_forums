Also sorry for the stupid ! in place of the letter i, I wouldn't write that word like that on another sub but I'm trying to avoid trolls coming here.\n\nI haven't watched the show since like season 1, but on my TFMR board someone posted that there was a storyline going on where a pregnant character (April) was carrying a baby that was found to have birth defects on ultrasound. They found out that it was [Osteogenesis Imperfecta](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Osteogenesis_imperfecta) and were awaiting results to find out the severity. Apparently the character is very religious so lots of people were worried that they would have some sort of \"miracle\" happen where the baby was miraculously cured. \n\nWell, in last week's episode April found out that the baby's condition was Type II, which is severe, and most babies die within the first year. She decided to induce labor at 24 weeks - terminating the pregnancy. I didn't watch the episode (because holy shit, TRIGGERS) but apparently it was extremely emotional and many of the people on my TFMR board said it was really well done and realistic. However, the word \"abor!on\" wasn't used once on the show. Not surprising, but a little dissapointing, IMO, because that's what inducing labor at 24 weeks for birth defects *is*.\n\nThen someone posted an interview with the actress who plays April, Sarah Drew. She said this:\n\n&gt; Yes, we're going to deliver early, but it's not going to be an abor!on. \n\nThis seriously makes me SO MAD. Terminating a pregnancy for medical reasons *is still an abor!on*. I understand that word makes people uncomfortable BUT IT'S THE TRUTH. The reason I think it's harmful to deny that TFMR is abor!on is because anti-choice legislation directly affects people who terminate for medical reasons. The reason for your abor!on doesn't matter in many states. There are some that have exceptions for the health of the mother or baby, but some don't. The federal bill that just failed in Congress a few weeks ago didn't allow for any exceptions. By trying to separate TFMR from abor!on for other reasons, I think we're risking people forgetting about us, and letting these anti-choice bills pass.\n\nI constantly hear people supporting term limits on abor!on, saying stuff like \"well, I support these limits because you need to decide if you want an abor!on before 20 weeks, that's plenty of time.\" But TFMR is often done past 20 weeks because many issues aren't found until the anatomy scan, sometimes even later (like in my case). I saw comments like this on another sub a few months ago and I commented about what happened to me. I had SO MANY people respond and say \"I wasn't even thinking about termination for medical reasons when I said I support abor!on term limits, I'm sorry.\" I also have heard people who say they're anti-choice say \"well, TFMR isn't abor!on, that's not what I mean when I say I don't support abor!on\". Therein lies the problem. IT IS THE SAME MEDICAL PROCEDURE. Your reasons DON'T MATTER. The law is still going to affect if, how, and when you can have an abor!on.\n\nLastly, because I'm a glutton for punishment or something, I went and checked out the comments for this episode on the Grey's Anatomy sub. A highly upvoted comment before the episode aired was someone saying \"I hope that April gets a miracle and the baby is okay!\" and another person saying \"a baby was just born without kidneys in my state and lived, miracles do happen!\". OKAY. First of all, the whole idea of \"miracles\" is just fucking hurtful for someone going through this. You don't see severe birth defects on ultrasound and then go back for a followup and see that everything's cured. THAT DOES NOT HAPPEN and to put that false hope in a woman who is already going through this horrible pain is just cruel. Also, some people may not consider a baby surviving without kidneys to be a \"miracle\". My baby wasn't going to have kidney function, and if he had survived birth and the first few weeks (unlikely), he would've spent the first year or two of his life in pain, hooked up to machines 24/7 and enduring multiple surgeries. To me, that wouldn't have been a \"miracle\" and that's not \"living\", that's just \"being alive\". Those are two different things to me. \n\nI'm happy that Grey's Anatomy portrayed TFMR in a (mostly) realistic way. But I wish that actress hadn't made those comments, and I wish the show had been able to directly use the \"A\" word and not tiptoe around the issue. \n\n\n\n", "stickied": false, "subreddit": "ttcafterloss", "subreddit_id": "t5_34scd", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "A long rant about Grey's Anatomy [trigger warning - termination]", "url": "http://www.reddit.com/r/ttcafterloss/comments/2w3ucb/a_long_rant_about_greys_anatomy_trigger_warning/"}, {"author": "SansaScully", "author_created_utc": 1406227887, "author_flair_css_class": "", "author_flair_text": "Moderator - TFMR 8/14", "author_fullname": "t2_hk1cj", "created_utc": 1424115990, "domain": "self.ttcafterloss", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/ttcafterloss/comments/2w3wyl/subreddit_rulessuggestions_poll_results/", "gilded": 0, "id": "2w3wyl", "is_self": true, "media_embed": {}, "num_comments": 4, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/ttcafterloss/comments/2w3wyl/subreddit_rulessuggestions_poll_results/", "retrieved_on": 1440903947, "score": 5, "secure_media_embed": {}, "selftext": "I just finished looking through the results of the poll I posted a couple weeks ago.\n\nOverwhelmingly, most people didn't want to *ban* any terms or phrases (like baby dust, sticky, BFP, etc) from the sub. \n\nThe results on *discouraging* their use were more split, but the slight majority of people were in support of discouraging use of the phrases \"baby dust\" and \"sticky\".\n\nAs for allowing self-posts about positive tests, the majority want to keep allowing them as long as they're tagged. \n\nI'm thinking that as for discouraging \"baby dust\" and \"sticky\" there should be a note in the sidebar about it.

She only has four 'categories' to go through, but I need more structure than that so I'm using the categories from [this website's](http://www.whitehouseblackshutters.com/areas-to-declutter/) areas of the house to declutter and also the [non-stuff to declutter](http://www.whitehouseblackshutters.com/non-stuff-things-to-organize/) list, keeping track with this [printable](http://www.whitehouseblackshutters.com/40-bags-40-days-2015-printable/). \n\nShe did a reddit AMA and was asked about things that were too functional to get rid of but didn't bring joy: \n\n&gt; Dear Marie,\n\n&gt; What about keeping objects that don't spark joy but that I don't want to spend money or time replacing right now and which are still helpful - for example a computer, a mattress, a toothbrush, a frying pan, a suit, a blender, a coffee table? Should I keep these if they don't spark joy but I still use them regularly?\n&gt; \n&gt; [\u2013]MarieKondo\n&gt; \n&gt; So those things are helping you every day. Because you are using them. \n&gt; \n&gt; Even if they are not sparking joy, they are helping you every day. They are making your days go by - meaning, you have not realized that they are making you happy. They are sparking joy to you, subconsciously. So it's you, just not realizing that sparks joy for you. So you should convince yourself that they are sparking joy, and you should prioritize their status, because they are making your day, everyday. Then, gradually, you will start seeing some sparking joy concepts from those items. \n&gt; \n\nI've found that this is a great thing for taking my mind off TTC. This is my third cycle post MC and it took 7 cycles with good timing (11 total) to get pregnant. I not really feeling pessimistic about it but I have low expectations for getting pregnant again soon. What if it never happens? Will I still be here this time next year?\n\nSo getting my house in order is a great distraction (for me). There are a couple of KonMari facebook groups that are fun to follow to watch other's cluttered spaces improve and get tips and such. \n\nHas anyone else read the book and are trying it out?\n\n", "stickied": false, "subreddit": "ttcafterloss", "subreddit_id": "t5_34scd", "thumbnail": "default", "title": "[OT] Has anyone else read The Life-Changing Magic of Tidying by Marie Kondo?", "url": "http://www.reddit.com/r/ttcafterloss/comments/2wol8k/ot_has_anyone_else_read_the_lifechanging_magic_of/"}, {"author": "AutoModerator", "author_created_utc": 1325741068, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_text": null, "author_fullname": "t2_6l4z3", "created_utc": 1424592153, "distinguished": "moderator", "domain": "self.ttcafterloss", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/ttcafterloss/comments/2wqssd/ttcafterloss_ttc_daily_discussion_thread_february/", "gilded": 0, "id": "2wqssd", "is_self": true, "link_flair_css_class": "ttc", "link_flair_text": "TTC Thread", "media_embed": {}, "num_comments": 21, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/ttcafterloss/comments/2wqssd/ttcafterloss_ttc_daily_discussion_thread_february/", "retrieved_on": 1440893149, "score": 6, "secure_media_embed": {}, "selftext": "This thread is for members who are TTC or waiting to try.

My husband took it very hard, but is doing fine now.  I used Cytotec to help it pass, as with my career, waiting wasn't an option.

Having these 2 beautiful, strong women has helped me so much.  \n\nI'm at  the point where I'm waiting for AF and wanting my body to be back to normal so that I can move past this completely and start over.

Do I only count the days I have flow and ignore the spotting? \nThank you for your help.", "stickied": false, "subreddit": "ttcafterloss", "subreddit_id": "t5_34scd", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Tracking period question", "url": "http://www.reddit.com/r/ttcafterloss/comments/2xk6n4/tracking_period_question/"}, {"author": "MackieMouse", "author_created_utc": 1345487806, "author_flair_css_class": "", "author_flair_text": "TTC #1; missing Ethan after 22wk loss; 2 ectopics", "author_fullname": "t2_8qcwd", "created_utc": 1425226354, "domain": "self.ttcafterloss", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/ttcafterloss/comments/2xkis4/gettoknowyou_thread_pets/", "gilded": 0, "id": "2xkis4", "is_self": true, "media_embed": {}, "num_comments": 60, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/ttcafterloss/comments/2xkis4/gettoknowyou_thread_pets/", "retrieved_on": 1440879101, "score": 5, "secure_media_embed": {}, "selftext": "They will never take the place of a two-legged human baby, but pets in your family sure lessen the sting of loss and infertility just a little.

She's a little older than me, and her clock is ticking louder (She's early 30's so we're not running out of time yet). We've had two different donors, the second one yielding two pregnancies. Our beautiful Veronica who was stillborn Sept 2014, a loss I still feel keenly and one that has no explanation. A month ago we lost another pregnancy just shy of 12 weeks, also unexplained. We're trying again soon, but I'm looking for community because I've never gotten back to feeling like myself again after Veronica.\n\nOur first shot back on the TTC wagon after the stillbirth took, late in 2014 and we were over joyed. I felt like my brief revisiting of the TTC world was a hazy mistake that I wouldn't have to return to again. It wasn't too painful because we had this comfort of a new pregnancy to ride out the bad feelings left over... We were a few days shy of 12 weeks, confident as all get out and I started to tell people. My cousin spilled the beans to the entire family... Again... You'd think I would learn, but last time it was my mom who couldn't keep it to herself. We were excited and happy and looking at those 'loss' stats again, feeling ourselves inch closer and closer to the 12 week 'all clear!' mark.\n\nThen the blood came and by the time we got in to an ultrasound they could barely tell that my wife was pregnant the week before. Now, we're just waiting for normalcy to return, having told everyone again that we lost... My wife tells me that she wants to try again soon, and my only caveat was waiting until she had a normal cycle BEFORE we inseminate, to get the timing right. I want to as well, I just... Don't really want anything right now. \n\nI've spent the last month trying to get my head on straight. My life has been a series of hard and confusing days ever since we left to deliver Veronica without a car seat. TTC sucks right now. Everything that I have to do is a reminder of how much harder it is to get knocked up. We're stepping out of every established institution but the law. We have a legal donor agreement that we had Canada's top family lawyer (who happens to work in our province) sign off on, but other than that... We've been making it up as we go, meeting dudes off the internet to get sperm, and buying sterile cups to get the job done. We've got a SA of our donor (and he has an army down there, seriously,) and fresh medical records for him everytime we try, so it's not dangerous per se... But it feels foreign and unknown.\n\nAnd then there's the pain and jealousy that comes as everyone in my life has beautiful babies. My sister gave birth last year to a truly stunning little girl. We were supposed to have similar due dates with Veronica, if she made it that long... My coworker I get coffee with every day is having his second accidental child, via c-section in two weeks... And while he's super sensitive 90% of the time, I spend 80% of my time trying to choke down my natural reaction to tell him to fuck off about anything baby related. Everyone I once knew from roller derby seems to be knocked up or nursing a beautiful child and most of my fb is blocked for that reason. I hate them all with every fibre of my being, then hate myself for being so damn spiteful and jealous. \n\nSo... I'd love some people to talk to who aren't going to judge me on those ugly, frustrated feelings... I know I don't speak to the major experience of carrying, and losing a child, but I think that there's enough overlap to belong here. I'm glad there's a place like this, and people who fill it, even if we're all here for shitty reasons.

You're telling me it's oh so rare when I'm told by my doctor 1/3 pregnancies are miscarriages, and chromosomal errors are most likely the cause? Fuck you dude. And fuck biology.

Of course that was before December 17th 2013. I've had two healthy pregnancies in the past. So when  I found out I was pregnant in Nov 2013 I didn't think anything could go wrong. The ironic thing was the reason I had found out I was pregnant was because my husband had a dream I was pregnant with a boy, but that I would lose the baby. \n       I was over the moon when I found out I was pregnant with our third child. I refused to take into account for the rest of my husband's dream. How would I, a pretty healthy person lose my baby? Its not like I was out drinking, smoking, or doing drugs. I'm going to tell everyone I was pregnant at Thanksgiving dinner, but my husband wanted to wait. Looking back I think the reason why is because he believes his dreams. Maybe had I listened to him I wouldn't had been so excited, or devastated. \n       For about 6 weeks I was one of those blissfully happy pregnant  women. I was already picking out names, color schemes  for the nursery, making my amazon registry. I went  about my  daily  life trusting my body to do what it has done in the past. Guess I was far to trusting of my own body to do something as natural as creating life.\n       I finally  had my first u/s, left the office with an edd and a picture of that beautiful little life inside of me. I was told it appeared that I was starting on my sixth week, so that was why we weren't  really  able to pick up a heartbeat . I swear I saw the  flutter of a heartbeat. After speaking to my ob she pushed back my due date and then scheduled  me for  another u/s on Dec 17th. Something didn't seem right when I did the math, but I thought maybe I was wrong.\nHaving my first u/s in hand I told my parents  that I was pregnant  and invited  them to the second ultrasound . I then told my sisters and everyone was happy.\n       The day of the ultrasound arrived, and I couldn't  be more excited  to see my little bean. I would have been 8 weeks and would be able to pick up the heartbeat. My mom went back into the room with me, while my husband  and father happily waited for us. \nThe room with silent at the tech conducted the ultrasound. It wasn't like the one before, for the young lady was talking to me the whole time. I had that gut feeling that something was wrong , especially when the tech told me she had to take this to the radiologist. Before she left the room I asked her how far she thought I was a long. She said about 6 weeks. At that point I knew I lost the baby I didn't want to break down in tears and cry in front of my mom but she knew I was upset. My mom did her best to comfort me, telling me to wait till he talked to the doctor. Finally the test came back in she told me my only was on the phone for me. I walk into the other room and she went to go get my husband and father. \"I'm sorry to inform you but it looks like you have lost the baby.\" hearing those words I broke down, I didn't want to believe what she was saying. I definitely wasn't ready for the next question she asked. \" You have two options, and you can do a D&amp;C or you can go home and wait and pass the baby naturally, which do you want to do?\" My baby had been dead inside me for over a week already and my body couldn't  do yet again  what it was suppose  to do. I opted  for the d&amp;c and luckily  we were able to do things that night. I broke down in my husband's arms, I felt like a complete failure. \nI left the hospital empty that night, broken. My body failed to do a simple, yet complex task as it had done before. \n        For so long I carried around bitterness, jealously, hatred  for those who were pregnant. How dare they flaunt  their pregnancies in front of me. Didn't they know or care? Of course they couldn't know because  they were strangers to me. I suffered in silence, my husband didn't  even realize how deep a depression I was sinking  into. To this day I will never know why I lost my baby, why the universe or God picked me to suffer. Why I was so undeserving  of my little  baby. I have now been jaded and will never be that blissfully ignorant happily pregnant  person again SO FU UNIVERSE  FOR TAKING AWAY MY IGNORANCE AND NOW FILLING ANY FUTURE PREGNANCIES  WITH WORRY AND DOUBT.\n\nThanks for taking the time to listen, it feels  good.", "stickied": false, "subreddit": "ttcafterloss", "subreddit_id": "t5_34scd", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "My introduction and story", "url": "http://www.reddit.com/r/ttcafterloss/comments/2xu9q8/my_introduction_and_story/"}, {"author": "pscalici", "author_created_utc": 1370140842, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_text": null, "author_fullname": "t2_bw6xv", "created_utc": 1425431068, "domain": "self.ttcafterloss", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/ttcafterloss/comments/2xur58/trying_to_conceive_question/", "gilded": 0, "id": "2xur58", "is_self": true, "link_flair_css_class": "question", "link_flair_text": "Question", "media_embed": {}, "num_comments": 6, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/ttcafterloss/comments/2xur58/trying_to_conceive_question/", "retrieved_on": 1440874327, "score": 6, "secure_media_embed": {}, "selftext": "So, I  wanted to know if any of you know why is it that you can ovulate, have sex before, during ovulation , but you still don't get pregnant.
