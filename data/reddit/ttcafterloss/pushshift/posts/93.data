But the last few weeks have been more difficult. Specific people putting down how I'm feeling, which just causes me to be even more upset, especially when they say hurtful things. Whether they mean it to be that way or not... \n\nAnd I'm sure everyone here is feeling the stress that the pandemic is causing. I needed some testing done for something unrelated and all of that has been put on hold until who knows when, but can't have it done if I'm pregnant but it isn't urgent by any means... The country I live in, hasn't been hit that hard which I'm grateful for. But there's a lot of restrictions in place and they aren't going anywhere. Which I don't really mind, I'm a nurse so the longer the restrictions are in place the better really. \n\nMy period came \"early\" I don't temp but use ovulation strips.(temping is hard/unreliable when you work rotating shifts) And my period was probably 4 days early from the LH strips. Which has never happened before... this is cycle 4 after the loss. I'm not sure at what point you start looking into fertility treatments when you've had an unsuccessful pregnancy. It will be a year of trying in June... \n\nAnother thing that's kind of eating away is that in our house, the room that was going to be the nursery, it's almost finished now. My partner has had the time to work on it because he's laid off. So it's just about done. All the walls are up. Just needs mudding, paint, trim, flooring then finishing touches..... But it's come such a long way. But it's depressing thinking about what color to paint the room... and then it will be empty for who knows how long. \n\nI just keep hoping that the next cycle is the one. But it hasn't been....

I recently had a missed miscarriage at 11 weeks and a D&amp;C in March, and a friend I shared my story with referred me here, a place that helped her after she experienced pregnancy loss.  \n\nI'm really terrified to try again, because even seeing ultrasounds on TV makes my heart race at the moment.  Too bad I've been rewatching ER virtually with my Mom...maybe it will help me build up to actually being able to get one without panicking if I am fortunate enough to become pregnant again...here's hoping.\n\nThis pandemic also has me stressed about the idea of conceiving too...how are other people feeling about it?  I think I may ovulate in a few days, so I'm unsure of what to do.  Everything is so uncertain right now.  \n\nAnyway, I was feeling really alone until I shared with others about my experience, and I'm hoping for more of that as I think about trying to become pregnant again.  Not many people who are close to me have been through this, so it's hard for my usual support people to relate and to comfort me as I process everything.  \n\nAnyway, that is my introduction post.

The blood and cramps are reminding me of when my mc was at it's worse. I'm ready for this shit to be over with. I pray that we're able to conceive again...I know it's wishful thinking to hope we get pregnant again after the 1st cycle but I need to hold onto that hope... \n\nBeen feeling hopeful during the day then at night is when all of my thoughts turn to shit and I can't control my emotions.

I've tagged this as an \"Intro\" post, but I was very active in this sub from 2015 - 2017 when TTC #1. This post is likely going to be long - I haven't been here for a while and I feel like I have a lot to get out. \n\nI began TTC in 2015 and I had 3 early losses (CPs and 1 ectopic that lasted 3 months and had to be resolved with various procedures and methotrexate). My first was especially hard because my bff/cousin got pregnant the week I was losing the pregnancy and told me on my birthday (wtf)...but as it kept happening I sought out help from this sub and an RE. This sub and so many of the people in it literally saved my sanity. I still talk to a small group of the friends I have from this sub every single day. \n\nI had basically every test under the sun (including expensive karyotyping and a surgery to remove a uterine polyp and check my tubes) and everything came back normal. Although several docs poo-poo'd the idea of baby aspirin, I decided to take it on my own and give it one last hoorah before either doubling down and doing medicated cycles or giving up altogether. At the time I didn't realize why, but the baby aspirin worked and that cycle resulted in my son. My pregnancy was uncomplicated other than developing severe pre-eclampsia at the end. \n\nFast forward two years and we decide to casually TTC#2. I got pregnant quickly and it ended after some spotting similar to my other losses occurred and I asked for an ultrasound. All that could be seen on ultrasound was a gestational sac and I was close to 6-7 weeks so I knew it was not good. \n\nI saw an MFM doc for my pregnancy with my son, so I saw again when I got pregnant that time. When it ended in loss, he still saw me for a \"pre-conception consultation\" and he did what he called a \"shotgun of tests\" on me. He also hilariously said \"I am looking at your neck, you have kind of a thick neck...have you had your thyroid tested?\" to which I said \"yeah and it's normal\"...this man has the worst bedside manner on the planet and I joke about my thick neck constantly now. So thanks to him for that? WELL...TURNS OUT DR BAD BEDSIDE MANNER WAS RIGHT...I have elevated TPO-antibodies, so Hashimoto's Thyroiditis. No one tested me for that in the years I was TTC and visiting REs. Also, as he literally handed me my bloodwork results via individual pieces of paper, said, \"AND THE BIG ONE - Lupus Anti-coagulant Antibody!\", which was a shocker to me. I was negative for this in 2016 and it came back positive in 2019. So I have apparently have Hashimoto's and Antiphospholipid Syndrome. \n\nIt was like in an instant I had an explanation for my losses, for all of the pain, the unanswered EVERYTHING, my body being a troll and a failure...it felt so redemptive to HAVE A REASON. A scientific medical reason that is a documented and well known reason for pregnancy loss. And the treatment - baby fucking aspirin and lovenox injections. NO BIGGIE. CAN DO! It also clued me in as to why my pregnancy with my son worked out while the others did not (baby aspirin alone seemed to work that time). \n\nAfter getting my answer, I had a lot of hope that loss was behind me. In addition to all of these losses, my cycles are quite irregular and so sometimes I have to wait til CD 30+ for O, which is so frustrating. We decided to give it a go on our own before jumping into medicated cycles. I did twice daily lovenox injections in my stomach and baby aspirin for 4-5 months and eventually got pregnant. I was sick as a dog, so damn nauseous, and the pregnancy mirrored my one that worked out very closely, almost to the day as far as symptoms go. My husband was so hopeful. I had an early scan and they saw all the right things, but it was a little early for a heartbeat. The next appointment, at 8 weeks, there was no heartbeat. My nausea was so bad and my body would not initiate bleeding so I decided to get a D&amp;C simply to end the nausea. This was December 2019. \n\nLast month we decided to try a medicated cycle (femara) and I responded well to it. We decided to do baby aspirin preconception and lovenox shots upon a positive test. I got pregnant, started lovenox, but my betas eventually dropped and that one ended, too. So I am 6 losses in, 3 prior to my LC and 3 post. The treatments that are recommended for my issues have not worked for me, twice now. And then COVID happened and my RE stopped all new cycles. \n\nI don't know where to go from here. I'm almost completely numb. I don't have tears left. The losses are so clinical and normalized for me. I didn't even cry when I found out about the last 2. I'm so fortunate that they have all been early. When I'm in the middle of loss, I swear I can't handle it again and I'm done, only for it to end and I find myself wanting to try again and get right back on the horse. As most of you in this sub probably are, I am a planner and the whole \"just see what happens\" simply doesn't work for me. \n\nWell, if you have made it this far, thanks for reading. I've glossed over many parts of this 5 year journey, but this is the gist. I am going to try to dive back into this community and thought I should introduce myself, albeit in a long-winded way.

The CP was the only time I've seen a positive test. Friend's pregnancy announcement yesterday sent me into a tailspin and I basically cried myself to sleep. \n\nHas anyone else started to doubt if TTC is good idea? This whole situation (particularly the last month) has wreaked havoc with my mental health and I'm not even sure I want to do this anymore, but I don't know how to switch it off in my brain. For nearly a year I haven't gone to the bathroom without thinking \"should I be doing an OPK?\".  I know that now, if I ever get to see a positive test again, I'm going to be a nervous wreck. I've always imagined I'd really enjoy pregnancy and now it just seems like 9 months of panic. I read stories of couples who have gone through so much more loss than us and I feel like a total weakling. If I'm not strong enough to get through this then am I actually strong enough to be someone's Mum? \n\nI've wanted to be a Mum since I knew what a Mum was. This taking a while feels like a huge personal failure and I'm really struggling.

I tracked 50 cycles and I thought maybe cycle 51 would be that magic number. \n\nI ugly cried, snots and tears were all over the place but I was so happy that I couldn\u2019t wait to share the excitement.

After examination and ultrasound, it was confirmed that I indeed had a miscarriage. I know all the stats, the risk, the chances, but that doesn\u2019t mean it hurt any less. There was worrisome no symptoms prior to it happening. \n\nI would have gotten a beta test at the hospital but due to country wide lockdown at the time, there was no public transportation, not even taxis, it\u2019d been difficult and expensive for me to return. I figured the lockdown was going to be lifted and transportation would resume on the 24th, I can wait a few more days to find out at home.

This morning I was supposed to have my first pregnancy appointment, instead I was in the ER for the miscarriage. How very cruel is this coincidence.\n\nI\u2019m going to take a break from IVF for a couple months to take care of my mental health.

But mostly a vent. I have yet to introduce myself: I'm 32, husband is 34. Started TTC after IUD was removed last August. After what felt like the longest 6 months of my life, we had a positive pregnancy test in February. Pregnancy was confirmed in March. On April 1, I had a routine 11 week appt, at which time, no heartbeat was heard :( embryo was 8 weeks in size, so I had a D&amp;C to remove it. The resulting emotional pain and sadness was unlike anything I could've imagined. Physically, I have recovered just fine (though no period yet after 3 weeks, which I know is normal). \n\nNow here comes the \"question\" (/ dilemma / vent). Yesterday, I was peeing a lot. It reminded me of pregnancy (but no other pregnancy symptoms). I was losing my mind at the incredibly slim possiblity that I could've gotten pregnant again in the last 3 weeks. I figured 3 weeks since d&amp;c (but embryo stopped growing 6 weeks ago), urine HCG should be back to zero. So against my better judgement, I took a urine HCG test, which showed a very faint positive line. I'm 99.9% sure it's residual from the miscarriage. But I want to wait a few days before confirming to limit wasted tests. In the mean time I'm losing my mind. \n\nThe truth is, all of this is hard. The loss. The waiting. The not knowing. And that stupid test just made everything more confusing. \n\nThanks for listening.

On a few days I went out for a tiny walk (like literally 5 minutes) or just a little stroll in the garden, but I didn't have the energy for much more.  After about a week I was feeling much better, and my post-op bleeding had lessened a lot, down to a few drops of brown that can easily be contained by one pantyliner for a day.  \n\nI had not done any proper exercise for many weeks (was too scared during pregnancy) and so I was keen to get back into the swing of things ASAP.  I did some research and everything I could find said that you can start exercising once you feel OK in yourself.\n\nSo, yesterday I went out for a jog/walk for quite a while; I had the usual aches/pains afterwards, but noticed that my stomach (uterus?) seemed a bit tender when pressed.  I hoped it might just be my stomach muscles, but in honesty the tenderness seemed internal, not in the muscle layer.  I've done the same thing again this morning and the same thing has happened, to a slightly greater degree (possibly because exercised two days in a row?).  The tenderness seems to fade away after some time, so is this just related to the fact that I'm exercising, and when I'm moving things are 'jiggling around' inside?  Or could it be my stomach muscles squeezing/pressing against my uterus?\n\nI'm just a bit worried because I've read that one of the signs of infection is tenderness.  I obviously don't want to set back my progress, but on the other hand, I'm really enjoying the exercise and it's helping me a lot.  Aside from this, I don't have any other symptoms that could suggest infection, exercise doesn't seem to make the little bleeding I have any worse, and I feel fine.\n\nI will call the hospital tomorrow regardless to get their opinion, but just looking for some reassurance if anyone can provide it here.\n\n**TLDR; Am around 10+ days post-op.  Just started doing more moderate exercise and concerned with some uterine tenderness that seemed to result afterwards.

It wasn\u2019t a squinter, but over the next three days my line hardly progressed.\n\nCue me going into a reddit and google black hole. It was agonizing.\n\nQuick backstory, missed my period for 9 months and diagnosed with pcos. Didn\u2019t want to do Clomid so decided to try working with a dietician. Didn\u2019t work. Went on to acupuncture for six months and have had five cycles. Acupuncturist said my bbt chart looks perfect and not like someone with PCOS. \n\nBack to present. First beta is 28.

Husband (29) and I got pregnant on first cycle of actively trying (first pregnancy), we were really excited but since I work in the medical field, I understand MCs are pretty common so I tried to not get too attached. Then, I got to see my baby on transvaginal US and hear a healthy heartbeat (measuring 8+3, I was almost 10 weeks but I didn\u2019t know my exact ovulation so the doctor and I assumed I ovulated later, no biggie).This is when we began to feel it was real and started telling our families... a day later the bleeding began... and since I am here, you know how the story ends. My very first pregnancy ended in a natural MC. \n\nHcg levels returned to baseline four weeks after. Got my period almost exactly 7 weeks after the MC. Seemed to be a pretty normal period minus two days of light brown spotting. \n\nI feel optimistic but deep down have a fear of this happening again. \n\nGood luck to everyone out there who is going through this, I hope we all get our rainbow babies soon.", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "ttcafterloss", "subreddit_id": "t5_34scd", "subreddit_subscribers": 7120, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Started TTC journey", "total_awards_received": 0, "treatment_tags": [], "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/ttcafterloss/comments/g8fluh/started_ttc_journey/"}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "AutoModerator", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_6l4z3", "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_premium": true, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1587924541, "distinguished": "moderator", "domain": "self.ttcafterloss", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/ttcafterloss/comments/g8j6an/ttcafterloss_daily_discussion_thread_2_april_26/", "gildings": {}, "id": "g8j6an", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 7, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/ttcafterloss/comments/g8j6an/ttcafterloss_daily_discussion_thread_2_april_26/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1587924548, "score": 1, "selftext": "**How are you doing today?

It took a few years and a lot of therapy to get over the trauma of that experience, and we started trying again in fall 2019. When we did get pregnant, it felt wrong from the start. Very faint lines , spotting, and left side pain. My ectopic was diagnosed and when expectant management didn't work I was given MTX. My cycles are mostly back to normal now and we have waited the required 3 months. I want to be excited about trying again, but it feels like there must be something wrong with me for 2 relatively rare and apparently unrelated things to happen to me.\n\nI hope this doesn't come to across as insensitive.

We only told our parents and a couple other friends. My husband's grandfather was dying so he told his grandparents but he also told him that we were not announcing yet and to please keep it private. Well my mother in law and my grandmother in law both told EVERYONE. (They never told us they told everyone either.) And then we lost the baby. In an Easter zoom video call his grandmother gushed to everyone about how excited she was to have two grandkids on the way- our's and my husband's cousin. I couldn't take it and left. It was fairly obvious everyone except grandma knew and we hadn't announced to any of these people. I found it pretty mortifying and spent Easter crying. \n\nThen today I got a card from his aunt sending her condolences. And that's nice. I love his aunt and I love her for seeing me and thinking of us. But I'm really pissed at my mother in law for telling everyone something we explicitly told her was private. We had wanted to mail out announcements and if we had then  she already took that joy from us but alternatively she also took away our privacy to mourne the way we need to. \n\nI've been struggling with grieving and I've been meditating a lot to deal with the sadness and stress but getting that card today just set me back. I was doing so well. I felt like I was doing a lot better with getting back to normal and refocusing on TTC. \n\nIt's hard for me not to want to smack my MIL for being such a loud mouth. It's hard for my to blame my grandmother considering her husband just passed. My husband and I have agreed that MIL and grandma won't be told next time we get pregnant and they can find out in an announcement just like everyone else. I wish I didn't feel so set back by this today. I was doing so good with meditation and now I'm back to 24/7 cry fest.
