It happened so fast I was just left in total shock. At about 5pm I went to the bathroom and there was blood. A lot of blood. I got in the shower right after that and ugly cried for about an hour. The bleeding wasn\u2019t stopping. When I got out of the shower I called my OB who told me to go to the ER if the bleeding was heavy or if it didn\u2019t stop within an hour. Hearing that I kinda panicked and called my SIL who is a doctor and she rushed over to check on me. When she was on her way I passed a really big blood clot. When she arrived, she looked through what I passed and found the entire placenta perfectly in-tact. I had already accepted this as a fact once everything started but it still sucked. And my god there was so much blood. Her doctorly way of talking me through everything held me together and I got through the night with the help of some hot chocolate, popcorn, pizza and a silly movie. \n\nWhen I went to my OB the next morning they did a pelvic exam, ultrasound and blood work. I guess there was still some blood clots I needed to pass so she prescribed me something to induce labor to push the rest out and I was ordered on bed rest thru 10/30. Right now I\u2019m hanging out on the couch while the drugs do their thing. Hopefully I pass everything and no infections occur. \n\nThe plan is to monitor my hormone levels and make sure they go back to normal and then try again as soon as my body is able. \n\nAfter the initial shock and crying I\u2019m feeling much better. If I can find a silver lining it\u2019s that this all happened so early. I know what I was carrying wasn\u2019t viable and I know it happens to a lot of women so I\u2019m not alone. It sucks but I\u2019m not going to dwell on it and let it get me down. \n\nIf anyone has a similar story and would like to share, please do so in the comments or message me directly. \n\nThank you for taking the time to read my story \ud83d\udc99", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "ttcafterloss", "subreddit_id": "t5_34scd", "subreddit_subscribers": 4038, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Hello!

Was told we should do fertility treatment, and at the time, couldn\u2019t afford it because I didn\u2019t have a job. Fast forward to May and I took Clomid for the first time. Well, after taking my dose, was having weird symptoms so I decided to take an HPT and BAM. Big fat positive with my first ever pregnancy. Bawled my eyes out, freaking out over the phone with the nurse because clomid is category x for pregnant women. Did blood tests, My HCG levels were rising normally though, and I was having normal pregnancy symptoms and all that. Well, a week later, I started to cramp really badly and had some bright red spotting. Off to the ER we go. Come to find out, my pregnancy was ectopic and I went into surgery that very night. \n\nSo fast forward to now. I took my second dose of clomid this month. I feel like an idiot because I got my hopes up over the last few days because I wasn\u2019t having any signs of my period except for mild cramping and some brown spotting, which I had hoped was implantation. Hubby and I decided to get a little busy this morning and guess what? AF shows up DURING and I\u2019m fucking devastated. Not only did it kill the mood, I started bawling my eyes out, I couldn\u2019t look my husband in the face, I didn\u2019t even want him to touch me. \n\nThis has been such a frustrating experience and I\u2019m ready to give up. How am I supposed to feel confident going through these fucking treatments! My husband keeps telling me not to give up, that it\u2019ll happen, that we don\u2019t need the treatments, but month after month my trash can fills up with negative pregnancy tests and AF rears her ugly head. I never thought I would be devastated about getting my period, but it\u2019s EVERY SINGLE MONTH. Does it get any better? Any easier? It\u2019s been 5 months now and it\u2019s still so hard. I don\u2019t even like to see pregnancy announcements or happy pregnant women because I feel so bitter and it\u2019s really sad. It\u2019s not their fault but it doesn\u2019t make it any easier. \ud83d\ude2d\n\n", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "ttcafterloss", "subreddit_id": "t5_34scd", "subreddit_subscribers": 4043, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Defeated.

My SO and I didn't share the news with anyone besides 2 close friends and my coworkers (at hospital so it's unavoidable due to safety concerns). So I just feel really lonely lately, as it seems like no one that knows what I've been through really understands. \n\nWe've been together 4 years as of yesterday. I've been on just about every birth control out there, last one being mirena IUD that spontaneously left my body last Sept. terrible side effects led us to revert back to using the NTNP pullout method + calendar watching. Got excited one day, accidents happen. Took plan B within 24 hrs. \n\n9 days later I got my first positive test after being tired as hell all week, literally useless and exhausted. That was June 2, estimates DD Valentine's Day. We made an apt @8 weeks for July 2. \nOn June 27 I had a little spotting after sex, but \"so many people spot during early pregnancy, it's probably nothing\" says the nurse on the line. \"Come in if it gets bright red or more in volume\". Que us 8 hours later headed to a concert, stopping by target with blood clots falling out of me my the handful. Tears running down my eyes nearly having an anxiety attack I told my bf to drive to the ER instead. Had a friend come pick up the tickets so he and his fianc\u00e9 could go.. at least not everyone's night was ruined. \n\nThey treated me well, my nurse was the bomb and actually went to school with a few of my coworkers. She was literally a saint, and the ED resident was sweet and helpful. The bleeding subsided and started to resemble coffee grinds- signifying old blood. (Sorry if TMI). Pelvic US, pelvic exam and bloodwork later revealed a moderate SCH, baby's HR 88, measuring 6.2 weeks, beta at like 5.5k. \n\nMy thoughts: But that's impossible because we only had 1 accident, and I found out 9 days later. So if baby measures a week behind, I would've found out TWO days after we conceived? Great, I'm obviously losing the baby. Oh, and I have clinicals in 3 hours. \n\nSo I went home, teary-eyed, praying for a miracle, anxiety level 1000, got 1 hour of sleep and went to clinical at 6am because there were no makeups available. \n\nThey advised me to go ahead and go to the 8 week apt the following Monday. These results were subpar at best. Another pelvic US revealed baby still measuring 6.2 with a HR of 102. Still bleeding every time I wiped, everyone still saying \"it's so early the measurements can be a little wacky, just wait it out\" \n\nThen the next Saturday came, on July 7. Two of my best friends' birthdays. Arrived at clinical again, this time a little better because the bleeding had subsided. Considered telling one girl in my group who was close to me, because she seemed concerned and I wanted to have someone to vent to. Literally walked up to her when suddenly I felt something slip from me, like some sort of joke. \n\nThat clot was about the size of my palm. Stayed in the restroom like all day until I could leave at 2. Texting my SO, my boss saying I'm not coming in, praying that this isn't what I think it is, but deep down I knew. I've always known. What was I doing, though? What exactly was I doing when my poor baby's heart beat for the last time? Was it last night laughing and watching gossip girl? Or was it while I was telling my coworkers? What meaningless task was I doing while I was oblivious that my little one was struggling to survive?\n\nI drove strait to the ED from clinicals. My Heath insurance means I can only go to the hospital I work for, and we were on deferment so I had to wait. I recognized the same ED resident and he gave me Benadryl and zofran.. helped a little I guess, at this point I'm numb. This time I didn't even get a room. They took blood, gave oral meds, and sent for me to follow transport to ultrasound. \n\nSo off I go, walking upstairs with blood running down my legs, dropping on my feet, cramping like a bitch and having to walk upstairs with some other crackhead who needed an US of her leg (??) she's chatting with everyone. God I wanted to just kill her. Just shut up, I kept thinking. I can't keep up with this girl, I've been to US before just let me go alone. I'm cramping and short of breath, having to hold onto the rails to walk. Having to stop and literally push because I feel contractions coming, and feeing my baby slip from my body...but it's fine, there are people who need the ED's help more than I do. And my problem is already over, they can't save my baby, and they could save someone else... so I just didn't say anything. \n\nI'm not sure why the US tech insisted on doing an abdominal before pelvic. Sitting there with what I could feel was a ball of blood clots and my baby in my blood pants as she frantically tries to find a heartbeat on a baby that want there anymore. She finally let me go to the restroom and there it was, there was my little one. I didn't ever want to leave that bathroom, I swear it was the hardest walk I've ever been on. Climbing on the table was the worst. Every time she asked me to hold my breath to look for the heartbeat I think I died a little more. Finally I was freed to go downstairs and me discharged, as my beta hcg was 4.2k, down from last week. \n\nI don't remember much about the next few days.. just a lot of tears. My poor  boyfriend had no idea what to do, so he just gave me space. Our fur babies were my saving grace, I swear they just know sometimes. \n\nAlthough our baby wasn't planned it was loved from the start. The only reason we ever considered waiting (and taking the plan b) was because we wanted to be married first. But now it just seems so irrelevant. We had it figured out, we so excited to make it work. \n\nAnyways. Since then I've had a number of periods and they've returned to prepregnancy horribleness. I've been put on 3 month continuous HBC pills and have a lap consult scheduled in Jan. to check for endometriosis. \n\nI think one of the hardest parts is hearing the people say \"getting pregnant again is what helped me!\" But we've been back and forth. We've honestly considered eloping and trying in Jan. (Before the consult) now everything has just gone to shit. And I'm so tired of having been through \"my worst nightmare!\" As some say. \"I don't know how you could do it\" - yeah, I don't either, it's not like I have a fucking choice. \n\nMy SO's best friend is due a week before I was, and it's such a kick in the gut, and I have 3 other friends all due in Feb. and it is just so depressing.

I should be 9+1 today (due 2 June). In the past two days I've had two scans and it's clear that the baby we thought was so real and would be with us next year was just a phantom. There is nothing in the gestational sac.\n\nI'll be going back to the doctor in 7 days and if I haven't naturally miscarried by then the doctor recommends either a medical miscarriage or a D&amp;C (either vacuum suction or the traditional kind).\n\nAll I want is for this situation to go away. I want to get back to normal and ttc again. I want to be pregnant again. I've had no cramping, spotting, nothing, so I don't think this is going to happen naturally for me. Does anyone know which of the medical/surgical options would allow me to achieve closure the quickest? Is there a difference in how quickly my cycle is likely to go back to normal with each option?

I have December gatherings in the diary when I was going to tell my sisters, my friends, my wider family. All that is down the toilet now.\n\nThis is my first pregnancy and I know it's just chance and it just happens but I can't help wondering why it had to happen to me, and on my first pregnancy. I feel like it would have been fairer if I already had a child when it happened. I'm scared that I'll never have a child, just keep having miscarriages again and again until I'm too old.

She did an HCG and progesterone, with a repeat HCG 2 days later.  The day after my 2nd HCG, my OB called.  She said that my HCG didn't rise as expected and progesterone was at 2.99.  I was 5+2 when it was drawn, so she was expecting above 10.\n\nI go tomorrow for an US to confirm placement (she was slightly worried about ectopic, but I'm not having any pain) and I guess discuss options as this doesn't seem to be a viable pregnancy.  I'm still having the brown spotting (14 days and counting...).  I'm anxious for tomorrow as I want a resolution to this one way or another.  I've been so frustrated as the phone nurse acted like I just wanted an early US, and I've had to call each time to get lab results (including a blood test prior to all this for confirmation).\n\nI have so many questions for the doctor that I made a list so I won't forget anything.

Why didn't my body produce the progesterone? and on and on...\n\nI'm very sad, I was so excited for my first pregnancy.

I just need to get it all out. Before I had my son (now 15m) I had a MMC at 5w. Well I recently found out I was pregnant with baby #2. We had been trying for a few months so we were both super excited. My Dr scheduled me for a t/v ultrasound but at the appointment they said I was too early and to come back a week later. Came back a week later for them to tell me I was only 6w instead of 8w and that he can't seem to get a good heartbeat and that this would put me at a high risk for a MMC. They told me to come back two weeks later. Went in yesterday because I had been spotting. As soon as I got there I started bleeding. Ultrasound still showed the embryo being barely over 6w and it had only grown a tiny bit even though I'm 7w1d. Still a small flutter of a heartbeat but it was still low. Dr once again said it would most likely lead to a MMC. During the t/v ultrasound he discovered I had a yolk sac within a yolk sac...btw if anyone has googled it, it pretty much doesn't exist so myself and the Dr have no idea what it means. Now I sit at home with my son, sick as crap and trying not to worry while I still bleed and have clots. I'm pretty sure by my next appointment in November that there will be no baby and no heartbeat. I thought the chances of having a MMC after having a healthy baby were very low. It's frustrating having a Dr who ready doesn't answer my questions and I leave there feeling defeated. I also have issues with the type of uterus I have. Was first diagnosed with having a bicornuate uterus, current Dr rediagnosed me with having a partial septate uterus and just yesterday said it was either arcuate or bicornuate partial. Not helpful and he didn't address that after the ultrasound either. I just had to vent. I love my son and so blessed to have him. For now I'll snuggle him and watch his favorite movie as many times as he wants.

We went to the emergency and the doctor said that most of it is cleaned out. After that she had one regular period and then it suddenly stop. After that she had a lot of spotting and some bleeding (she did not have any feelings of periods).\n\nThis continued until August where she was concerned and wasn't sure why her body hasn't recovered. So we went to her GP and she booked us an appointment with a gynecologist. She did an ultrasound and then the Gyno gave her misoprostol to clear out what could be left in there. We came back a month later to do a check up and they did a vaginal and stomach ultrasound. Once that was done the gyno came into the room to talk about the situation. He didn't bring any papers with the results and started asking the exact same questions as he asked the first time we met. he said it should come back in 2 to 3 weeks but my wife was worried and started crying because she's been told that her body is fine and it will get better but it only gotten worse. then the gyno had the audacity to ask her ''why are you crying?'' in a insensitive manner. after that he said that she had some cysts and that we should wait again 2-3 months before coming back to see him. A few days later my wife gets a phone call from the technician who did the ultrasound saying that she wanted to do a biopsy in 1 week to see what is wrong. So we went to my wife's GP and told her that we would like to change gyno because the one she sent us too was a jerk and didn't care.

Both times before, I had barely even a line and immediately started my period after finding out. This time, I have no idea how far along I was because my cycle was odd and I had a pretty dark line on early Monday morning. I had been testing prior but got all negatives up to two days before my positive test. I was cramping that entire time, and then I started bleeding lightly, which then turned moderate about twelve hours after I got my positive. I'm still cramping and bleeding at this point, bright red.\n\nI took two further tests yesterday. The first was significantly lighter than my positive and the second was barely even noticeable. I probably shouldn't have tested quite as much, but I was freaking out.\n\nI just took another test (about two days after my positive), to make sure my hcg was going down, and it's actually slightly darker than the my test from yesterday. I've included a picture of all four of my tests.\n\nSo my questions are this:\n\nIs this normal? Should I just assume my tests are all off because of urine concentration? Have I just tested too often to see my hcg going down? I've read online that many people with chemical pregnancies got a negative test before their bleeding even started. Should I be concerned that my hcg may possibly be going back up, as I've read that may be related to an ectopic pregnancy? Should I just stop testing or wait a week and test again to make sure my levels have gone down?  \nI have no idea what I'm doing as the last two chemical pregnancies felt just like a regular period and this feels nothing like it.

We had gotten pregnant on our honeymoon and had no clue. I was on the pill but hadn't taken it for a week due to typical wedding stress. I began bleeding heavily mid-pack and it was like no period I'd ever had. I took a test and it was positive. I was about 5 weeks pregnant. \n\nAfterwards I stayed on the pill for another 6 months before going off and TTC for real. Over the next 16 months I was diagnosed with pcos, tried multiple medications, but wasn't getting a regular period or ovulating. My progesterone was horrible and I was referred to a fertility specialist. \n\nWe decided to stop TTC and work on our health. We went on vacation to Colorado and had the time of our lives. When we got back I met with a new doctor and was prescribed a weight loss pill. I decided to wait 2 weeks just in case. It was good I did because at exactly 4 weeks I took a test and it turned positive immediately.\n\nWe had ultrasounds at 5w2d, 6w2d, and 8w2d. My progesterone was 22 early on and my hcg was tripling in 2 days. We were cautiously optimistic but after the last US and seeing everything looked great we let ourselves get excited. I kept seeing posts about missed miscarriages and always hid them because I didn't want to think about that happening to me. \n\nAt 9w I over exerted myself and had some bad cramping that night. My doctors office said if there was no blood we were okay. But they were wrong. At 10w my husband and I went to an elective US. He hadn't been at my last two and wanted to see the baby before we announced on Halloween. We already had our announcement photos taken as well.  There we found out our baby had no heartbeat. \n\nWe went to the ER afterwards and had another US. It showed our baby died at 9w2d and I had two SCHs.

I\u2019m back at work, I attend my grief counselling, I have huge amounts of support from family and friends and haven\u2019t encountered too many idiots or people saying the wrong thing or being triggered by the real world etc. I\u2019ve been coping with what seems like the incessant amount of pregnancy announcements and invitations to baby showers - probably the only thing that really sets me off is hearing people complain about their pregnancies. \n\nWe got the ok to try again in September, and while I haven\u2019t been meticulously tracking ovulation or BBTs or OPKs or anything, we\u2019ve been trying to have sex at roughly the right time and see what happens. I got a bit excited last month because my period was 2 days late - right as I\u2019m thinking of testing, AF shows up. No biggie, I don\u2019t really know what to expect of my cycles right now and having a 30 day cycle instead of a 28 day cycle isn\u2019t a big deviance - prior to pregnancy I was a pretty regular 28/29 day cycle.\n\nI\u2019m now on day 32 of this cycle and while part of me wants to test, I actually think I\u2019m more nervous of seeing a negative test than I would be if I just wait a bit longer and see if AF shows up. My cycles may still be out of whack. I know I\u2019m being paranoid about symptom spotting, and I also know that pregnancy symptoms with my last pregnancy didn\u2019t really become obvious until my period was about a week late, so I don\u2019t trust myself when I notice a bit of nausea in the morning (especially because I have both fibromyalgia and anxiety, which both manifest in mild nausea fairly regularly). \n\nI was expecting to be anxious during a subsequent pregnancy - especially as I face a 20% chance of the same placental issues happening again, and there\u2019s absolutely nothing I can do to prevent it - but I didn\u2019t expect to be this nervous right before a *potential* pregnancy. I don\u2019t even know if I\u2019d want to tell my husband right away. I definitely don\u2019t intend to publically announce it next time (on Facebook etc). I have a new fear of miscarrying that I didn\u2019t have before, probably because my eyes have now been opened in regards to how common that is (we all know the statistics but never think it will happen to us until it happens, and I can\u2019t shake that now). I\u2019m scared that if I face placental insufficiency again, my child might not survive or might be disabled or premature or both. My doctors tell me to focus on the 80% chance that everything will go just fine, easier said than done! But I\u2019m trying.\n\nI don\u2019t know, I think I just needed to express these feelings and this is one of the safest spaces I have. I could talk to my husband about it, but while he\u2019s amazing and sympathetic I don\u2019t think he quite understands the level of mistrust I have in my body now and the fear that entails. I also don\u2019t know whether I should test and get it over with, or wait another few days and see what my body\u2019s doing.  I\u2019m still very new to the TTC club and I\u2019m not used to having to actively try for a baby and going through the experience of seeing negative HPTs when hoping for a positive.

Went into the hospital for a check on 10/5/2018 because I though I was habing gallbladder issues - nope just my liver throwing a raging tantrum. Platelet count was at 21,000. The OB on call held my hand and told me I had to deliver within 12 hours or risk death and/or permanent organ damage. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThey had to transfuse four units of platelets, two before and two during, my c-section. I had to be under GA and I had a classical internal incision due to his small size - an updated ultrasound showed him as measuring nearly a full month behind. At his 22 week ultrasound he had been 2 weeks behind - but my husband and I are shorter and no one was overly concerned. Little did we know he hadn\u2019t grown much past that point. He weighed 310 grams upon arrival. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy husband held him and talked to him and cuddled him for an hour until I came into recovery and woke up - I got to hold him during his last fifteen minutes of life. I barely remember and it breaks my heart. Our only solace is that it was peaceful for him and he spent his whole life being loved by us. \n\n \n\nI am so devastated. My body failed us both and I hate it for this. I want my baby back. I hate that I\u2019m picking out an urn and not picking items for a registry. My best friend gave birth 10/1/2018 and I feel so jealous and bitter that I haven\u2019t been able to look at her baby\u2019s pictures. I\u2019m angry my life got turned upside down and I don\u2019t have any inkling of how to turn it right side up. I miss my Theo so much it is a physical ache. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTo keep it relevant to TTC, my next pregnancy will be very high risk because of how early I developed my health issues. Oh and it will definitely be a c-section next time - if there is a next time. Doctor has cautioned holding off on TTC for minimum 10 months and my heart is screaming that it\u2019s too long. Then I feel guilty for wanting another baby when my first child hasn\u2019t even been gone a month. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSupport groups in my area aren\u2019t really an option - we\u2019ve called a few contacts the hospital social worker gave us but no one has contacted us back and we think some of the group might just be defunct. Hence why I\u2019m reaching out to the internet today. Thanks for listening. I appreciate it.

In June, the doctor pretty much told us our chances of conceiving on our own is 4% and we would have a higher chance with an IUI or IVF, both of which are not options for us. \n\nSince then I've been working on eating healthier, taking prenatals, Synthroid for my thyroid, and Metformin to help regulate ovulation and have had regular cycles for the past 3 months. Since my cycles have been regular and I feel like I've been handling work stress a lot better, I've been really hopeful and I want to keep ttc, but my husband has been really distraught since hearing those chances and work has been very stressful for him. Yesterday was extremely hard on him since he talked to a lot of people at work saying they were taking their kids trick treating and he was really quiet when he got home. I tried to encourage him and tell him that 4% doesn't matter now since my cycles are you more consistent and I've lost weight but that number is haunting him... We both absolutely want kids but I don't know what to say or do anymore. I do all the cooking, finances, and chores so when he comes home he doesn't have to feel even more stressed... I've tried to get us both to go out more and have date nights, talk about things other than ttc, etc... But I just don't know anymore because now he just wants to be alone a lot of the time and it's heartbreaking. \n\nHave you and your partner been through something similar where it just get so emotionally stuck from even trying anymore? How do you stay positive and motivated to ttc?", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "ttcafterloss", "subreddit_id": "t5_34scd", "subreddit_subscribers": 4088, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "How to keep ttc and be supportive?", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/ttcafterloss/comments/9teq6w/how_to_keep_ttc_and_be_supportive/"}, {"author": "RoxyFurious", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_zj2t1", "author_patreon_flair": false, "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1541130429, "domain": "self.ttcafterloss", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/ttcafterloss/comments/9tgp35/heck_of_an_october_hi_everyone/", "gildings": {"gid_1": 0, "gid_2": 0, "gid_3": 0}, "id": "9tgp35", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_css_class": "intro", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_template_id": "a05e5124-7120-11e4-952e-12313d148545", "link_flair_text": "Intro", "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 11, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/ttcafterloss/comments/9tgp35/heck_of_an_october_hi_everyone/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1541130429, "score": 1, "selftext": "My story has been quite the saga, best summed up here:\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/CautiousBB/comments/9rejcm/cw_possible_mc_blood_i_dont_know_what_to_think/?utm_source=reddit-android\n\nUnfortunately, i had a follow-up scan today at 8w and the sac is right where it should be, size wise, but is empty- a diagnosed blighted ovum. They were able to fit me in for a d&amp;c tomorrow- i hate hospitals but it seemed the best of a bad bunch of options (my hcg just keeps rising so it doesn't seem like it's happening naturally). I'm nervous and sad. This was my first pregnancy, 2nd cycle trying and I'm 36. It was the most perfectly timed pregnancy you could imagine and I'm super disappointed to be closing that door. My husband has been great through this whole ordeal, very supportive though i don't think he truly \"gets it\". He's very much in the \"oh well, we can try again\" camp.  I just said sadly, half to myself \"i guess this is my last night pregnant for a while\" and he said \"well you can't really call this pregnant, can you?\"\n\nUm, none of my clothes fit, I'm nauseous as hell, ive got a sac I'm feeding, and I'm crying. Yeah I'm pregnant, even if there's no fetus. I told him that felt insensitive and he said \"why? You know what i meant\". \"Yeah, and you know what i meant,\" i said. \"Tell you what, you have the next one and we'll see how you feel\".\n\nAt least I'm more angry than sad now. \n\nAnyway, any advice for someone about to go into not only their first d&amp;c but their first surgery?

Dinner is in the oven, my man is gaming, but instead of browsing artisan cheese recipes and figuring out next week's to-do list, I'm trying to hold myself together so I don't cry again. \nOn Sunday, everything was normal. We spent the day doing housework and shopping, cleaning and enjoying the day before another week of work. Settling into bed, I began to notice some pressure in my lower belly. It became more and more rhythmic, and I started to think the worst. All of the sudden, my water broke and we were rushing to the hospital. 24 weeks and 2 days, and my mind was racing. \nI was up all night, poked and prodded and eventually transferred to a hospital with a great NICU, but was told before leaving the baby had complications. \nMonday morning a team of doctors evaluated me and did another ultrasound, confirming that my son had a strong heart, but there were extensive complications with his brain, and even full term he likely would not live long or at the very least have a difficult life. I understood, basically saying that Jeremy was not meant to be.\nI received an epidural as they were expecting me to deliver at any time, then I began to bleed out. I was losing a lot of blood, and was rushed to the OR for an emergency C-section. As soon as I made it there, the bleeding stopped and I was sent back to continue waiting. \nA whole day goes by and nothing. Just sitting and waiting. Wednesday I met with the lead doctor on the team, who explained I was in an unfortunate circumstance. Although my baby was not \"compatible\", I had to wait until I either gave birth or was bleeding out again before doctors could intervene due to Texas abortion law. It was also determined that the placenta had blocked the birth canal, and if I did deliver I would definitely need a C-section. I was taken off the epidural and transferred to a new area.\nIt was late in the evening on Halloween when I began to feel some cramping. It turned into more painful contractions, but they were barely being picked up on the monitor. The pain was increasing, even after 3 shots and demerol, to the point where I was nearly screaming in agony. It was 3 AM when I was brought back to labor and delivery, crying in almost constant pain. \nI was brought into a labor and delivery room, feeling like something was tearing me apart from inside. My contractions felt like they were in my birth canal. I had never felt this much pain in my life. I had no medication, no epidural, just my fiance's hand and the sides of the bed. The nurses rushed to try and get me something for my pain, and when they returned with an anesthesiologist to put in an epidural, I was on a new level. My legs were writhing in pain, and I could feel pressure everywhere. The baby was coming.\nI knew I had to push, and after I did everything was a blur. No more pain, and a rush of nurses around me, asking how I was, taking the baby, checking me to make sure I was still there.\nI don't remember all that much except that I wanted to sleep. I had no tearing and no complications, and no pain.\nI finally got to meet Jeremy when I woke up, even though he was not alive when he was born. The hospital had a professional take some beautiful photos, and made a memory box for me to remember him by. It was a tough goodbye.\nThrough everything, I'm still gasping for breath at how much was changing in the blink of an eye. I can hardly believe how much I went through, and still came out with best outcome considering the circumstances. No c-section, no tearing, no stitches. Just a broken heart but a determination to try again. Jeremy wasn't ready yet, but I know he will be next time.\nI'm just laying here trying to wrap my head around the wildest, most painful and powerful week of my life.

He was born alive, but died about a minute after. \n\nAs I expected, there was nothing wrong with my son. I'd had excellent prenatal care and every test and scan showed that he was growing and developing as he should have. \n\nHowever, the conclusion after placental examination was a placental separation with hemmorhage/partial abruption. I was also apparently low on amniotic fluid, even though I'd just had my anatomy scan a few weeks before and the placenta and fluid levels looked ideal. \n\nI had a subchorionic hematoma which caused a bleed daily from weeks 7-15. The last two months of my pregnancy were happy and uneventful. But I specifically asked my doctors about the risk of placental abruption, and in both the US and UK they said I had nothing to worry about. \n\nSo...now I'm terrified to be pregnant again. My husband and I have access to an excellent fertility clinic in the US. Our son was conceived via IUI, although they found no medical reasons for why I didn't get pregnant on our own after trying for over a year. Although I'm 40, I have a high egg count and my hormone levels are very good. According to my RE, closer to that of a woman 10 years younger in fact. \n\nWe can apparently make a healthy baby, I just can't seem to carry one.\n\nMy husband has a cousin in her mid 20's (in the UK, where we live) who is unmarried and has a toddler daughter from a healthy pregnancy. The pregnancy was a surprise from a trip abroad and the father is not in the picture. She's been very kind and supportive and has said often how much she loved being pregnant and would love to be pregnant again. \n\nGiven these factors, I don't think it's an outlandish idea for us to ask her to be a surrogate, since my chances of undergoing IVF and having some quality embryos are decent. I don't want to pin all my hopes on her, but I don't think it would be too crazy of an idea. \n\nI'm just not sure how to approach her about it. Thanks for listening.

We've stayed close and have visited back and forth at least once a year.  We aren't as close as we once were, but I still consider(ed) her one of my closes friends up to this year.\n* I am travelling home to Canada for 2 months starting in a week\n* When I lost my son, I texted her to let her know, and give her some small details about what happened.  She responded quickly with an I'm so sorry message, not asking for any more info or really asking me anything in particular.  She sent me a random message about 4 months after that about something unrelated to my loss, and then messaged me a week ago to ask when we were going to catch up while I'm in North America for 2 months. Literally 3 messages in almost 10 months. \n\nSo - the WWYD - I really don't want to see her.  I'm disapointed in her reaction to my loss, as one of my closest friends I would have at least liked her to maintain the level of communication we had before, which she didn't.  I would have liked for her to check in with me at least once to see how I was doing - she didn't.  \n\nAll my friends and family are saying to let it go and just see her, don't blow up the friendship over this - but I don't know if I can look past it. Literally everyone in my life that I can think of, close or distant, was more sympathetic and responsive than she was. \n\nWhat would you do? Would you try and move past it?  Am I being too petty?\n\nPS - A mutual friend of ours had a late loss in 2011 and was also very upset by the way this friend reacted - they don't talk anymore. I have been talking to this mutual friend a ton this year because we share this experience - this may be clouding my judgement.

Cue much crying, anger, confusion (I've been pregnant twice with no issues conceiving) and the beginning of this stage of my journey. This was after about 6 months of unsuccessful TTC. My doctor hadn't been originally worried until I mentioned that we were pregnant twice, neither with any issues, but suddenly we couldn't conceive. Things didn't add up. She sent me for full blood panels, ultrasounds, you name it. We found a \"cyst of considerable size\" and off we went for an MRI and referral to an OB/GYN.\n\nWe had our MRI and found multiple cysts on each ovary and were told that he was thinking of surgery with a \"2-for-1\" style approach. He wanted to hit \"Reset\" on my fertility. He would go it, get rid of the cysts that looked concerning, do a D&amp;C, do a dye test of my fallopian tubes to be sure they were open, working, and happy, and off we would go to screw like bunnies and make a million babies. (because as my OB/GYN said \"you should go and make more cute babies! Because that's what you make!\").\n\nWell after the MRI results came back and he really seemed to look at the cysts, they weren't of concern. So he started me on Letrozole (Femara) to help kick my ovaries into high gear to force ovulation and to get me pregnant. It's been 6 months of said protocol, with 1 dosage increase and nothing. I've had increased pelvic pain around ovulation, narrowly avoided ending up in hospital a few times due to the pain (I'm stubborn okay. I can't help it) and have had issues with severe vertigo during ovulation *week* and put on an \"as needed\" medication when I have the vertigo issues.\n\nThis Monday I had another visit with the OB/GYN and said I was at the end of my rope. I don't know what to do, we are coming up on another full year since we started this process and we haven't had as much as a single \"pregnancy scare\" every month I have pretty much gone \"it's not happened this month. This sucks, moving on, bring on the period, and the cramps, the tampons, all of it. Let's start over\". I mentioned the pelvic pain, the quality of my life as a result of the pain, and he asked me some questions and poked around.\n\nGUYS!! We are finally actually doing the surgery!!! Instead of removing cysts he is going to check me for endometriosis, and presumably treat it should I have it, check my fallopian tubes, do a D&amp;C, and a couple other things that I forget off hand (and couldn't read on the forms because doctor handwriting is awesome). It's not for another month (December 19) but we have a date. I'm getting looked at and taken seriously. Even if this doesn't fix my fertility, we are going to be treated for some of the other issues.\n\nWhile he's in there, he will likely be able to see if I do indeed have some level of prolapse in my pelvic organs (another thing I mentioned since I'm oh, so familiar with my lady parts, my cervix feels like it's down and in front of my vagina - like the heel area of the sock versus the top of my vagina - like the toe area of the sock for lack of a better analogy). \n\nSo yeah. I'm ready. I'm terrified, I need to do way too much between now and then and I don't have enough time. I am scared of the pain, the recovery and all the unknowns that are coming with this surgery since many things won't be answered until I'm under anesthetic and I can't answer things myself so they have to ask my DH, plus what is going to happen with my LC during my recovery period and how that will all play out.  But I'm ready. It's another like 2-3 months were I can't get pregnant, but this will be worth it since this is actual tangible progress.\n\nNow to fill my freezer with make ahead meals.

So I tried to put the fear out of my mind and my symptoms were much stronger this go around. Every few days or so I\u2019d tell my husband I just didn\u2019t feel pregnant starting last week. He just said don\u2019t worry we can\u2019t do anything about it anyways. So again I ignore it. \n\nThen I started getting this sore throat, and I thought ok maybe it\u2019s just allergies. It persisted for over a week and I lost my voice. Went to the doctor they said they don\u2019t know what\u2019s going on but I couldn\u2019t speak at all. I had a very low grade fever but I took Tylenol and the antibiotics I was prescribed. Woke up today after taking the antibiotics once last night and I felt horrible so I called in sick to work stayed in bed. \n\nAround 2:00 I went to the bathroom and noticed I was spotting. I don\u2019t even know how I feel. I really just expected this but this was also my biggest fear, that I won\u2019t be able to conceive or carry baby to term. I feel so defeated. I have no problem getting pregnant I just have a problem with keeping it. I\u2019m waiting on my doctor to call me back and we will see what is said. Part of me feels like being sick for so long is to blame and maybe this isn\u2019t a huge underlying issue. I\u2019m not super sad because I really tired to distance myself from this pregnancy and not get excited. I\u2019m just frustrated. \n\nSorry I just needed to vent I guess.

For both, I spotted/bled lightly almost every day until I eventually started cramping and passing clots. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHas anyone here had a similar experience? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI feel like the cause of my losses lies in the fact that I start bleeding soon and that it continues.

Had had the Harmony test which showed lowest risk categories, then the 20w anatomy scan showed some anomalies that were expected to not be too much of a big deal considering Harmony results, went to see an MFM specialist and got a better ultrasound which showed additional issues, then got an amnio which revealed T21 diagnosis but some of the issues found on the second ultrasound were not common to T21 so would have been even more issues on top of that diagnosis... so then we TFMR. (And during that delivery I found out I have PTSD from my first birth with my now 3 year old, so that was a nice addition to a truly terrible day...)\n\nWas pregnant again after my end of Aug period and then this Monday I went in for my first appointment at 10 weeks with the MFM, but when she went to do an ultrasound at the end of the appointment I knew something was wrong. The machine wasn\u2019t great but she basically couldn\u2019t see much of anything except maybe a tiny shadow when really zoomed, so she sent me to their radiology department for a better ultrasound (had to wait 5 hours) which confirmed that the baby had stopped developing at about 6 weeks and had no heartbeat. Was holding up on because I kind of knew what was coming after the first ultrasound, but then when the radiologist was handing me the report she asked \u201cyou have a tiny baby at home now right?\u201d But no, I don\u2019t. And then I lost it and had to walk past all the other pregnant ladies in the waiting room trying not to completely lose it and start sobbing loudly.\n\nHad the D&amp;C today (which went well, all things considered), they\u2019re going to karyotype test the embryo to see if there was another trisomy.

And what\u2019s with the first and then maybe another trisomy?? After the TFMR they confirmed that it was an accidental form of T21 (rather than inheritable form) but are my eggs just damaged now or something? And wtf Harmony?! And then they refused to refund me because it was in the acceptable margin of error. IM NOT JUST A NUMBER, IM A PERSON!
