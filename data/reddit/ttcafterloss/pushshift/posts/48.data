This is what I felt compelled to share with people today because I want people to know. I don't want to pretend it never happened. \n\n\"For most people, today is just another Wednesday. For me, it\u2019s the day I was supposed to become a \u201creal\u201d mom (or at least close). I\u2019ve learned a few things in the past six months. For one, I\u2019m a lot stronger than I\u2019d ever thought. I didn\u2019t know that it could feel like my heart shattered into a million pieces and still keep beating, but here I am. I never knew that just words or photos or seeing strangers leading perfectly normal lives with babies could cause physical pain, quite literally gut wrenching, nausea inducing pain. I\u2019ve learned what it feels like to feel completely alone, despite the fact that \u201cmiscarriage is so normal.\u201d (Screw those people, by the way. That doesn\u2019t help anyone.) And even though I know I'm strong, I also feel completely broken, torn apart at the seams, barely hanging on, and as low as I've ever felt. \n\nI\u2019m writing this now because there are some things I just wish people knew, and they don\u2019t because no one really talks about miscarriage, and talking about it has to start with someone, so why not me?\n\nI wish people knew that it\u2019s not just losing a baby, you lose hopes and dreams that you had begun thinking about. You lose an entire future that you\u2019d begun planning. I started almost obsessively searching online forums for people going through the same thing, feeling the same shitty feelings, just to feel normal and sane. I went to complete strangers on the internet because most people find it uncomfortable to talk about. I get it. It's not easy. It really sucks. It seemed like people expected me to move on in the same way that you move on when a grandparent who\u2019s lived a full life passes away. I want people to know there\u2019s a big difference. I want people to know this experience is life changing. Honestly, six months later, I\u2019m not ok. I don\u2019t know when I\u2019ll be \u201cok\u201d, and that\u2019s fine for now. I\u2019m not as happy as I used to be. I hate it, but that\u2019s just how it is. I'm still struggling to come to terms with who I am as a person now. I wish people knew that it\u2019s generally ok to talk about it, or to ask how I\u2019m doing (spoiler! Not well at all). I might cry, I might ramble, but it just means so much to know someone cares enough to ask. I might not always be ok to talk, and I'll tell you if I'm not. I guess it just feels like that support system you have when people know you're pregnant just disappears because you're not anymore, when really you need that support system even more. Miscarriage doesn't just end with a D&amp;C. The emotional roller coaster continues well beyond that day.\n\nI\u2019m choosing to think that my purpose for God today wasn\u2019t to become a mom (obviously), but to start discussion and to encourage people to reach out to their friends and family who have gone through this, or will go through this in the future. I don\u2019t think miscarriage should be such a taboo topic. It really sucks, but maybe it can suck a little less for people in the future if everyone starts to realize just how seriously devastating it can be, and to just be there for each other whether you understand it or not.\u00a0\"", "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "ttcafterloss", "subreddit_id": "t5_34scd", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Should be my due date...

It started with confusion but acknowledgement that everyone handles loss differently, but I'm now starting to understand how many of you ladies (and some gents) may have felt.\n\nSince joining this and similar communities, I've seen many posts about how their due date is coming up soon or will be in X days, along with words explaining their feelings and/or desires to do something to commemorate the day to recognize the loss.  In no way do I think negatively of anyone who wishes to do that, but it's not something I felt I would have needed to do so it was a desire I couldn't really relate to.  My loss *was* a blow and I was pretty down for a about a week or two, but eventually I accepted the loss and moved on.  Then came a few more losses, some more emotional roller coasters, and I thought I finally reached some sort of dark zen of resignation.  After my most recent loss, my OB and the other staff at his office were very sympathetic, asking how I felt, and I just sort of shrugged and said, \"Well, already had 4, what's a 5th?\"\n\nWell, now it's my turn to reach what would have been my due date.  I never calculated what the EDD would have been for the first pregnancy, but but full term would have fallen sometime in September or early October.  If the pregnancy didn't end, I'd very likely be running around (or lying down and recovering) with a wailing newborn, freaking the F out not knowing WTF to do.\n\nI'm neither sad nor relieved, but I don't exactly feel neutral about it if that makes sense.  It's just... sort of a weird thing to realize because I *could* have had a baby and be feeling like I've been thrust into chaos, but instead I'm totally not pregnant, can't try until sometime in mid-November at the earliest (doctor's orders), and will likely be pouring myself a glass of Japanese whisky to sip with dinner before settling down to play some video games.  It's like two completely different realities, and it just feels... *weird*.\n\nI think I'll talk about this with husband tonight and let whatever feelings emerge just take their course.\n\nIn other news, I resumed charting the day my MC started.

On June 29, at 27 weeks, I had a bout of what I thought was food poisoning - and my midwives concurred. That evening, I landed in the hospital in septic shock, and the doctors couldn't find my baby's heartbeat. My baby had passed, and I almost died, too. I was so drugged up those days are thankfully a blur. I was put on Pitocin until our little girl, Rose, was born in the ICU late on June 30. \n\nI had two D&amp;Cs as the doctors tried to figure out how I had gotten so sick. They assumed it was a uterine infection that had spread to the rest of me, but after multiple scans, tests, and consultations (25+ doctors examined me to varying degrees), they determined I had an obstruction in my small intestine that had perforated. I had two more surgeries, then finally went home after 28 nights in the hospital. \n\nI've been home, slowly recovering, ever since. I was so focused on keeping myself alive that the grief over losing Rose was delayed, but it's hit with full force, especially as I approached her September 25 due date. A couple weeks ago, my husband and I spent a weekend at [Faith's Lodge](https://faithslodge.org/) in northern Wisconsin, where we met other couples going through similar circumstances, and it helped a lot. We found peace there, and it put us in a much better headspace. \n\nSince I had most of my small intestine removed, nutrition is a big problem, and I'm gradually learning how to eat to nourish my body. My doctors urge patience, and say that once I've healed enough from the surgery and am getting adequate nutrition to support myself, let alone another person, only then can we talk about trying again. Depending on the doctor, they predict that it could take anywhere from 6-18 months. But they also urge me to remember that I'm 36.\n\nSo here I am. My period finally (finally!) returned yesterday, almost 12 weeks after the last D&amp;C, which is a really good sign that enough nutrition is getting through and that I'm healing. But there's a long road ahead.

It's like half way through the month but whatever!\" month). But waking up this morning after feeling like garbage all day yesterday (when I was pregnant with my son I *knew* before we tested that I was pregnant. My sense of smell was off, my emotions were all out of wack. I was a different person and it was fucking weird). Woke up and went to the bathroom and right away bright red, Aunt Flo in all her bitchy glory is here in full force. \n\nI keep trying to remind myself that most couples on average take a while to get pregnant. It's normal to spend multiple months trying and not having any positive results. But I can't help but compare back to getting pregnant with my son (1 month was a hail mary and was a negative. The next month it was literally wham, bam, thank you ma'am) and the pregnancy we lost in the spring was an accidental failed pull out and it happened to be the right timing and we were pregnant. This whole trying, and actively tracking this is so fucking foreign to me it's downright cruel feeling. \n\nOPK's are ordered on Amazon and slated to be here on the 3rd, I've got 20 of them and here's hoping I actually am ovulated at some point during my cycle because I have no fucking clue what's going on these days in my lady bits. Going out to buy pre-seed (or some other clone that I saw on the shelf the other day that I can't remember off hand) and then I'm going to be peeing on all of the things.\n\nWas going to be doing temping, but my work schedule makes temping a little difficult as I don't always have a consistent wake up time. I live in Canada and we are coming into cold and flu season so my temperature could potentially be all kinds of wacky simply because of getting sick here and there (and with a slime monster in daycare 40 hours a week, we get sick pretty easily these days). \n\nSupposed to go to a Stag and Doe tonight and it will be the first time meeting one of our newest baby cousins (he's like 5 months now, but he was born right after we miscarried so his existence is a painful reminder of everything.) I also am pretty sure a number of friends/family there will be asking if we are going to be having #2 any time soon as we are really the only ones in the family who are married, own a house, and only have 1 (or none) children so we are kind of the \"next in line\" to have more babies. \n\nOh and I'm already sick with a nasty cold and don't really drink at all anymore as it messes with my PPD/PPA related issues.

Our family is pretty cool, but we would like a child together.\n\nWe spent a lot of time on the fence about having a baby, and finally decided to \"let the universe decide\" and I went off the pill in Dec. 2015. Got pregnant almost immediately in March 2016. Saw the heartbeat at 7 weeks. Started spotting at 11 weeks, went for an US and no heartbeat (and no growth). Had a D&amp;C and we decided to try again.\n\nTook 3 months to get my cycle after my D&amp;C. Got pregnant in January 2017. Went for the first US at 8 weeks and no heartbeat. Gave it another week and nothing. Another D&amp;C. Did genetic testing and found two trisomies that made it not viable.\n\nWe are both over 40, so we decided to pursue IVF. All out of pocket, unfortunately. Testing found nothing wrong. \n\nWe went through a round of stimulation and after 12 days only had 3 follicles and my estrogen wasn't super high. We had prepaid for two cycles, and we were able to cancel that round before the retrieval and it did not count toward our 2 cycles.\n\nSecond round seemed far more productive. My estrogen rose much more quickly and my follicles were measurable more quickly, too. (The protocol was different.) Unfortunately, I still only have three measurable follicles. But we pulled the trigger last night and are going in for egg retrieval tomorrow morning.

We've been married for 2 years. We both have great jobs but mine is pretty stressful and sometimes requires international travel (I'm a lawyer at a big firm in DC). We waited to try for kids until we got in a good emotional and financial state. We were so happy when I got pregnant on our first month trying in July 2017, though my fertile window that month happened to be during the absolutely most stressful week of my entire career. So it was basically me getting home at 11 and leaving at 6 am, with us somehow getting the energy up to have sex late at night or after the alarm went off at 5 am. Not exactly the super romantic babymaking I had dreamed of but we were determined and excited to finally be trying.\n\nI got a squinter on a Sunday and went to the doctor for a blood draw first thing on Monday morning at CD28. Got the results back the next day and my HCG was only 13. So of course I spent the entire day on Dr. Google and was a wreck of worry. I told my husband the good news when he came home that night but it was a double whammy of \"yay I'm pregnant!\" followed immediately by \"so my numbers right now might be concerning.\" Again, not at all how I'd pictured that moment for so many years.\n\nLong story short, my doctor had me come in for an HCG test each week for the next 2 weeks. The first one was an encouraging rise and I started to relax and hope. The second one was bad and she had me come in the next day for an ultrasound at 6+3. The sac was empty and the baby was measuring at 4-5 weeks. We were told I'd probably miscarry within the week. About 24 hours later it started.\n\nThe past 6 weeks have been one of the worst times in my life. I keep having horrible thoughts, like did my stress levels during conception kill the baby, yelling \"F&amp;$@ YOU!!!\" at my phone when a friend complains on Facebook that her baby is wiggling too much #36weeks #preggoproblems, feeling like I'm drowning at the bottom of a pit, and feeling so guilty that I don't have anything left of my first baby - that his burial was on a pad that got thrown away or in a toilet. I don't go on social media anymore and I was super happy that a work trip meant I couldn't make it out to Seattle to help my SIL take care of her toddler and newborn while her husband was away for a few days. I didn't take any time off from work and no one has offered me any.\n\nBut! So many friends and family have reached out with unceasing kindness. Mr. LuvU and I are closer than ever. He encouraged me to pick out a ring to wear every day to remember the baby and I ordered one from the same lady who did my engagement ring and wedding band (can't wait for it to come!). I know beyond a doubt how much I want to have kids. And things are gradually getting better. I planned a surprise anniversary trip for us to Amsterdam at the end of this month and that's when we can start trying again. Of course I still find myself crying for hours once or twice a week.\n\nAnd I've found this community. You are all so honest about your struggles and triumphs, and so supportive.

I\u2019ve been diagnosed as IBS-D in the past, but it\u2019s been largely under control for the past few years. \n\nI lost the pregnancies, but not the stomach problems - if anything, they are much much worse now than when I was pregnant. I\u2019m starting to get desperate for relief. I\u2019m with Kaiser, I saw my doctor, who gave me an antispasmodic. It helped a little, but not that much (slightly fewer cramps just meant less of a warning that I needed to find a bathroom). I told them I\u2019d been treated for SIBO in the past, so they threw some antibiotics at me. I got so sick from them that I couldn\u2019t keep water down, so was unable to finish the course (they weren\u2019t the same antibiotics I was on previously for SIBO). I\u2019m living off Imodium and peppermint oil to get through the work day. I\u2019m trying to take the right kind of fiber, as well as good probiotics, but nothing is working.

I can barely eat without nausea or my food running right through me. \n\nHas anyone else gone through this? I feel so incredibly alone and like my doctors don\u2019t care.

I\u2019ve tried acupuncture, which I think had a slight positive effect, and I intend on going back for more treatments, but frankly I\u2019m desperate and grasping at straws.

It was an exhausting day with a lot of cajoling her to follow instructions/get out of the way of the tractor. At one point, she wanted to play in this little fenced in area full of toys that were clearly intended for children younger than she was, but she's quite small so I knew she wouldn't be overpowering to any of the one year olds in there, and I was relieved to have a few minutes to sit in the shade and catch up on a few texts while she played somewhere safe and contained. \n\nThere was an older woman in this area-- I have no idea if she was an employee assigned to maintain this area, because she seemed overly interested in taking charge of the children, but she wasn't wearing an employee tshirt, and her daughter was there (with what I assumed was HER daughter; she seemed to be about two years old) and the daughter was holding the baby of someone who I presumed was a friend, because she said something that made it apparent to me that the little baby wasn't her own. The older woman made some comment like, \"I've been telling you to have another one!\" I rolled my eyes at this because I always find it annoying when people tell other people to have children, but whatever, if this is normal in their family that's none of my business. \n\nThen the older woman engaged me in some chit-chat-- she asked me my daughter's name. She asked me if she was my only child. This is a triggery question for me, because I truly never know how to answer it. I have one child and I have another child, but I don't really feel like I have two children. So I tend to answer this question based on my feelings that day/the situation, but generally when it comes up, I say, \"yes, she's an only child\" because I don't really want to get into it with strangers who are generally just trying to make idle chit chat. So that's what I said today, because I didn't want to get into it-- I just wanted to chill in the shade. \n\nThen she asked me my child's age. I told her, \"she turns three later this month.\" Her response?  A joking, \"Oh, well, then it's time to have another one!\" Fuck you very much, lady. That's none of your business. But again, I didn't want to talk to this woman any more than I had to so I just stared at her stony faced for a second and then went back to my phone.\n\nA few minutes later it was time to collect my daughter, so I geared myself up to have a negotiation about how many more times she could go down the slide before we left. As I was trying to engage my daughter, the old lady came up to me AGAIN. \"My daughter doesn't think she wants another one just yet. But are you thinking about it?\"\n\nWHAT THE HELL, LADY. How dare you? This is none of your goddamn business. I was crouching on the ground to try to talk to my daughter but I looked up at her and was like, \"You know, I did have a baby. In May.\"  And she got SO excited, like, \"Oh, you did?\"  And I said, \"Yes. He was stillborn.\" \n\nAND THEN.\n\nShe looked at me, tried to bend down and HUG ME, and then the most preposterous thing of all-- she said, \"It's okay.\"\n\nI took a step back. \"No. It's not okay. My baby is dead. It's not okay.\" \n\nShe was still trying to hug me. (Seriously, what the hell.) \"You'll see him again someday.\" (WHAT? ARE YOU GOD? NO? THEN DON'T TRY TO MAKE SOME BULLSHIT GUARANTEES LIKE THAT TO ME.)\n\nI rebuffed her again. \"I don't want you to hug me. It's not okay. Don't tell people that they should be having children, it's none of your business.\" And then I scooped up my daughter, who, bless her, knew better than to have a meltdown about being pulled from her play in that moment, and stormed off. \n\nI hope I ruined that woman's day. I hope she is still thinking about this encounter as much as I am. I hope she feels terrible for butting into my business and forcing me to delve into a painful topic on yet another day when I am trying to survive the world after burying my child and help my other child navigate that loss as well. I hope she can't sleep tonight because she is replaying this situation over and over in her mind. And most of all, I hope she never ever suggests to another person that they should have a baby on HER timetable instead of their own.

Not graphic, but... I just have no one else to talk to right now, and I'm struggling. But I don't want to weigh anyone down with it. \n\nHere we go.\n\nI'm almost 30, lost our first child to miscarriage earlier this summer.\n\nBeen married several years, friend just got married and is due weeks after ours was due. She is being very delicate about it (long-distance friendship, so luckily I don't see the bump). She was very kind to me when I shared news of our loss, and hardly gives me any news on her pregnancy... but now I'm just... I'm just angry.\n\nAngry and scared. But I feel like an asshole. \n\nSo now my friend is due when I was due, a honeymoon baby for her. All my married friends had babies right away, I feel like they look at me sideways for still begin childless. \n\nAnd no, I admit we didn't try right away because A) I had just begun hormone therapy to even sustain a pregnancy and B) my husband lost his job shortly after we married and spiraled into depression over the corruption he uncovered in his field. \n\nI was constantly angry and ashamed.\n\nFast-forward to this summer, we're overjoyed. New job, new town, new home... new baby... \n\nGone. \n\nShe's gone. We'll never meet her.\n\nI felt like a walking tomb. I hate my body, I fucking hate it. Stupid cycle makes me sick, my bleeding is so heavy EVERY month that 2-3 days are basically spent in the bathroom. Ovulation HURTS so much I have trouble walking, using the bathroom, but still have incessant thirst. PMS is so bad I'm almost a different person. Fuck you, body.\n\nMy hormone levels were less than HALF what they needed to be. \n\nNone of my in-laws who got the news sent me a card, sent me condolences. They all have 4+ kids. It's like I'm supposed to forget it ever happened. \n\nI'm constantly angry and ashamed.\n\nI haven't forgotten. I think about it every day. Every period I re-live the loss.\n\nI'm so angry. \n\nWe finally got the ok to try again, Dr has put me on hCG injections, which my husband will administer in my back. We'll do one month's round without TTC and then try the following month if my response is good.\n\nBut why NOW when I'm still mourning our first, I'm fighting with cold feet?? NOW I'm thinking of all the negative things people say about having kids, NOW I'm thinking about the other parts of my life...\n\nI should be grateful that we're making progress with my health, that we're moving in the right direction... but I'm scared of losing another baby, I'm scared the injections will make me sick, my health will rob me of more productive time... \n\nNow I'm scared and angry. What the hell is wrong with me? I should be grateful, things are going so well.\n\nJust a few weeks ago, I got the opportunity to go back to school and focus on my art full-time, BUT I'm scared pregnancy will make me too sick to work, baby will make it impossible to keep focused... I spent (wasted) so much time and energy taking care of us when we hit rock bottom, that now I'm playing catch-up with my art skills... I feel like I'm under so much PRESSURE to get my skills to a professional level in only 9-12 months (if we're lucky) then... stop? What? Having a baby is a good thing! WHY are these things running through my head? What is my problem?? \n\nWe just moved nearer to family, BUT we have yet to settle in and make friends. I'm scared I'll become isolated. One person told me, \"It's really hard to make friends once you have kids.\" Great. \n\nI would rather have our first alive and growing than have all that time. Even if it meant being sick and alone...\n\nSorry, I'm just... having a bad day, needed to vent. I know there's so much I should be grateful for, so I feel guilty that I'm even upset.  \n\nI can't make head or tails of my emotions. If anyone reading this prays, please send one up for me.\n\nThanks. Let me know if I violated any rules here, I'm feeling uncharacteristically impulsive, so I very well might have missed something.

Since then I have been doing everything I can to be there and support her through her pregnancy even though a part of me hates all of it. But she keeps telling me how she doesn\u2019t have anyone else to talk to and how thankful she is I am here for her so I feel guilty when all I can think about is how much I wish I didn\u2019t have to see it and hear about how much she hates being pregnant. \n\nIt helped that the worst of it we were out for summer so I was able to deal with some of it without seeing her, but every major event like finding out gender and announcing it, I keep being reminded that had things worked out it would have been me...\n\nOne of our coworkers who knew what happened to me made a comment yesterday while we were both standing there about how impressed she was that I was still involved and could talk to her about her pregnancy. I kind of wanted to throw a fit about how I didn\u2019t want to be that person... I want to be the person that says I can\u2019t handle this and I don\u2019t want to do it. But then I feel guilty...\n\nI managed to make an excuse to get out of her gender reveal (she had told me the gender the day she found out so didn\u2019t even need to be there for the surprise with everyone else) but now I\u2019ve been approached about cohosting her work baby shower.   They want it to be the day which had things worked out for me would have been my last day of work... again chances are no one but me has put that together but I just don\u2019t think I can do it. Not just host it but I don\u2019t know if I can even be there... how do I manage to say no at this point?

I went to the doctor at what was supposed to be 8 weeks and there was only a sac measuring 6 weeks. That was on the 27th. This Sunday I started spotting red, then monday it turned light to dark brown. Both days it didn't last long. They did an ultrasound monday afternoon and actually saw development in the sac and a possible heartbeat that was too small to measure. Yesterday morning I started spotting red again that during the day was more constant and less spotting. I awoke at 1am in extreme pain. Really close to my period pains (which get really bad) but a little worse than I'm used to. I have not really fallen asleep since then and it's now 830.

I am making a list of questions to ask the doctor when I go to see her a week from Friday. She already said I can start again as soon as I am ready but I am  going to wait for my cycles to normalize. The questions I have so far are: \n\n1. Can I get my progesterone tested before I am pregnant again?  My progesterone was a 4.5 at 5 weeks which led them to putting me on progesterone. I've now done some research that says I should be on progesterone before I get pregnant for it to be effective. \n\n2. My right tube was damaged to due a burst appendix (thanks high pain tolerance!) and appendectomy when I was younger. She said the left tube looked ok but is IVF something that I should look into in order to avoid another ectopic. What if this surgery damaged my left tube? \n\n3. I have PCOS (cysts are on my right ovary and elevated hormone levels). Is there anything I need to do in order to carry to term (like taking metformin). I was not on metformin with my last pregnancy but would like the next pregnancy to have the best chance possible. \n\n4. Are my chances of another ectopic really 1 in 10 with the right tube removed? The right tube had all of the scar tissue. The left one looked fine. I know ectopics only happen in 1 -2 % of all pregnancies (I should seriously but a scratch ticket) but I am terrified of it happening again. \n\nPlease let me know if there are other things I should ask.

I bled really heavily for maybe 4-5 days, then it tapered into on-and-off spotting for another two weeks.

We were cleared to have sex, but were told to avoid getting pregnant for 2 months.\n\nSo, my first post-MC period started Sept 30, 33 days after I started MC'ing.  I had 3 day of heavy bleeding (normal for me), followed by one day of very light spotting.  Normally the rest of my period will taper out after about 6-8 days during which my body will expel clots and dark brown blood.  My husband and I have also had sex during the spotting days of my period, and at most it may pump some clots out.  But after yesterday's sexy times, I bled bright red blood.  Overnight, more bright red blood came out and when I went to the bathroom in the morning my pad was soaked.  The only time this has happened in the past was when my hymen first broke/tore/whatever.  The bleeding has subsided a bit but bright red blood is still coming out.\n\nHas this happened to anyone else?  I've read that the vaginal wall can become engorged with blood during pregnancy and there could be spotting after sex while pregnant, but I'm not right now. \n Does the vaginal wall tend to be more delicate after a MC?

To keep this as short as possible, I'll post two comments I left in BabyBumps six months ago:\n\n\"Hey Everyone!\nI'm ecstatic to be back in the BabyBumps community. I'm 4 weeks pregnant with my second - found out at 3 + 1 but had that \"feeling\" almost immediately.\nMy first is 22 months and this is definitely a whirlwind for us. I ugly cried about not being ready as my initial reaction, but hey, I was even less prepared for my first.\nI was pretty active here before but under a different account. I was diagnosed with MRKH (and therefore the inability to have kids) as a preteen. I posted my story then and got lots of encouragement. Having a kid was never in the cards for me, but now I'm on round two.\"\n\nAnd to explain my medical condition:\n\n\"I have a full copy of it saved somewhere on my laptop but basically:\nI was diagnosed with MRKH when I was 11. I had severe abdominal pain and kept going to the emergency room. It turns out I'd been menstruating for about five months. With my case of MRKH, I have a fully functional uterus but was born without a vaginal canal. So my periods backed created a huge mass and I had emergency surgery to drain it.\nBetween 11 and 18 I had several surgeries - four or five I believe - to create an artificial canal. But with all of the surgery, endometriosis, and tons of scar tissue in my reproductive system, I went from being diagnosed infertile to being told I could probably get pregnant but could never actually carry a pregnancy to term.\nI got pregnant with my first at 23 and had a fairly healthy pregnancy. I have to have birth via c section; it's impossible to give birth naturally for me. But I can have healthy pregnancies and babies!\nI spoke with my old treatment team from years ago, and there's no other documented cases of an MRKH carrying out a pregnancy. Pretty incredible and wild to me!\nThat was a lot longer than I expected, lol. Sorry! It's hard to sum it up without leaving out important details.\nEdited to add: I also started receiving depo birth control shots regularly at age 11 to stop my periods. I think that was another contributing factor for why they thought I'd be infertile. It stunted my puberty growth a bit.\"\n\nI had a MC at 10 weeks (measured about eight weeks). The cause was listed as some sort of tear in the sac. I honestly can't remember. I was alone when I found out, so the shock kind of took over.\n\nDue to my medical history, I had no choice but to get a D&amp;C. I also had to get another surgery simultaneously because of my medical history. Long story short, it involved stitches and a skin graft inside of my cervix. My OB gave me instructions to call her ASAP if I get pregnant. But I don't even know if I can. I don't know if those surgeries messed things up. \n\nI had a long recovery - physically and emotionally. But my fiance and I decided to try again. I'm 14 DPO, cramping, and I know my period is starting within a day or so. Negative tests all around. Edit: period is here.\n\nI know nothing about TTC. I just know we tried during my \"peak fertility\" according to Clear Blue. I'm taking folic acid, eating healthy, prenatals...you ladies know. I'm 26. I don't have a mother. I don't know who to talk to about this. At all.\n\nIf you read this, thank you. I needed to get it off of my chest. I know that one month of TTC is nothing. But getting the courage to join here and write this was something I needed to do.\n\nThank you to the people who keep this sub active. It's bittersweet to find a group like this.

Devastating. I don't even have the words for it. \n\nMy bff, who is like a sister to me for nearly the past 20 years, was there for me entire pregnancy/loss and then one day in June, at a mutual friend's birthday party/dinner out in public that she organized, sat me down and told me she was pregnant with her second, a boy. \n\nI lost my shit, bawled, cried and this happened in front of everyone. It was the most miserable/embarrassing birthday dinner because the focus became her pregnancy and my agony/despair, not the birthday girl. I don't think she could have chosen a worse way to tell me when I'd been talking to her daily via text/phone about my pain/grief, etc. Why didn't she just tell me over the phone or give me some privacy? \n\nOur relationship has been strained since. We were supposed to hang out once but I cancelled- couldn't handle it. We text every once in awhile but nothing like before. Our relationship feels fundamentally different. \n\nOf course I am happy for her, but it felt like a knife going through my chest when/how she told me. It felt like a betrayal of trust to tell me that (I know that sounds dramatic!) but to me it felt like a level of our friendship was breached.\n\nHer sister sent me an invite to her baby shower yesterday - which is next month. \n\nI cannot go, guys. Emotionally, I cannot handle it and being around pregnant women still makes me sad.\n\nI hate that my loss has impacted so much: my friendships, my faith, how excited (I'm only sad) about pregnancy announcements I get, my feelings when I see pregnant people. Feel so robbed of so many things. \n\nWill gently tell her via text prob that I cannot go because of this. Wonder all the time whether our relationship is now changed forever. :( This is someone who has always been like a sister to me/who I always could count on til this moment happened. \n\nUPDATE: FML. I got invited to another shower today. Both boys, of course. Boys are so hard to me. I haven't responded to my bff (doesn't feel bff these days) but did respond to the new invite saying:\n\n&gt; Hi, Hope you have been well. Thank you for inviting me to your baby shower, though I regret, I cannot attend. Since my baby son died, it has been very emotionally difficult for me to go to those/be around it. I hope you understand and that it's fun. Wishing you lots of good vibes for your baby.\n\nShe didn't even respond back. \n\nIf's someone's child/mom/family died and they cared enough to write me about why they couldn't attend something so triggering, I'd at least say SOMEthing.

Additionally the prognosis for unexplained RPL is good - most people will eventually carry a baby to term.\n\n10-15% of rpl sufferers suffer antiphospholipid syndrome, and this is the only thing that really worries me (since uterine abnormalities and other problems are either rare and require IVF which isn't an option, or are less implicated in early losses). Though it's not highly likely I have it, the chance of carryinf to term if I *do* have it are slashed in half without treatment. \n\nI'm trying to decide whether I sit around and wait the 3-4 months for testing (if not longer) and take the risk of wasting my  eggs and maybe a chance at a good one, or whether I continue and risk another loss.

Yesterday I found out at my first appointment that my baby stopped growing at 5 weeks. I was 6.5 weeks pregnant. They tried to tell me that my dates could be wrong, and it could just be early. After explaining that I not only was certain about my date from temperature from I also found out at 11dpo, so my dates couldn\u2019t be more than a couple days off, the nurse practitioner just said \u201coh...\u201d. She wants me to wait for this to happen naturally for a week or two. I just want it to be over. I can\u2019t believe how hard this is. There are so many things. And unfortunately so many negative stories that I am telling myself. \n\nI\u2019m at a loss for what to do next. I know I don\u2019t have to decide now, but I\u2019m so conflicted. The pregnancy was really hard on me. From week 4 to 5, I cried pretty much the entire week. It got better at week 5 and I thought I could get through it. Now I guess maybe that was just when the hormones starting to decrease. I don\u2019t know how long this process will take. I just feel like I am forever waiting. Waiting for the official confirmation from blood tests on Tuesday... waiting for the miscarriage to start... waiting for the bleeding to start... waiting to see if it takes time for my cycles to regulate again.  And I miss my baby. \n\nWith the pregnancy being so hard, I am hesitant to think that I could do it all again. One part of me wants to never have kids now. Another part says I need to wait another year to be more stable in my career. Another part says it needs to be closer to at least a year and a half. I have so many concerns. Then I worry about how to wait or if to wait. If we wait, do I go back on the pill and risk having to wait for my cycles to regulate after getting off again? Do I start charting again and use that to avoid? It\u2019s an awful feeling to think about really trying again. I loved the information it gave me especially now when I know it gave me real information now instead of waiting to be in limbo until the blood work came back. But trying was so stressful. It was such a rollercoaster of emotions and getting up early was not my favorite since it woke me up or gave me anxiety thinking about it all everyday. We tried for seven cycles before getting pregnant and the entire process was stressful. I don\u2019t know what to do. This has been so hard, and the miscarriage hasn\u2019t even started. \n\nWhat was your experience like? Did you wait to try or go right back at it?

This has been the case since August 2016.  We were ready February 2016, but postponed the process because I switched jobs and wanted FMLA protections and maternity benefits from my new employer. \n\nAfter two failed rounds of IUI, we conceived in early November via artificial insemination (fresh sperm) and low dose of Clomid.  We were over the moon. Ordered a crib, assembled it. \nMy body miscarried at 7.5 weeks in early December. It was physically painful but the heartache hurt even more.  I did not have a D&amp;C, but passed our baby naturally, albeit in an airport bathroom since I was traveling to a conference for work. \n\nWe TTC at every cycle following with fresh sperm and good timing (ovulation strips, fertility monitor, tracking BBT). Our fresh sperm donor is also a 2.5 hr flight away, so monthly trips to see him were also part of this process. \n\nI was ready to give up end of May/early June, but decided to go one last round. Back on clomid. Ordered a syringe called \"mosie\". 3 daily inseminations. A week and a half later, I sobbed when we got our positive. \n\nAt our 6w3d appointment, July 3, and my wife's birthday, we found out that twins were in my womb and our world turned upside down with joy.  Double rainbow babies. So we started painting the nursery sky blue with rainbow decor everywhere. We wanted so much to celebrate. \n\nBabies were right on track for growth the entire pregnancy. We consulted with the doctor about potential risks, nutrition, morning sickness, etc. \n\nAround 14 weeks I started spotting and OB diagnosed me with a low lying placenta, which resulted in pink and brown spotting. \n\nThen it became red a few weeks later.  OB blamed it on the previa. Recommended we \"take it easy\" but not to worry since it didn't look like an abruption. Just a small bleed at the edge of baby A's placenta.  Also, they voiced some concern over low amniotic fluid. We had an anatomy appt the next week with the MFM, so decided to proceed with them monitoring all concerns. \n\nThe morning of the appt, I passed a blood clot the size of my palm. I figured I would ask the MFM about it. He confirmed the amniotic fluid was low and concerning. Also, complete placenta previa. But everything else was perfect. Perfect hearts, kidneys, bladder, lips, brain and eye development. Everything was spot-on for development. He couldn't explain the fluid issue and told me to take it easy with the bleeding. I cancelled the next day's business trip. \n\nI bed rested all week. I drank 4 L of fluid a day to try and hydrate our twins.  We found out they were a big and a girl. \n\nA week after the MFM appt, I started feeling Braxton hicks contractions. Overnight the bleeding worsened, passing 3+ clots everytime I went to the bathroom, but I was not in any pain.  We waited until morning, when I started to feel back pain, and called the on-call doctor. She told us to go to L &amp; D right away. \n\nI woke my wife and we drove to the hospital (1hr in rush hour traffic). I had 11 contractions along the way.  \n\nThey admitted me to the hospital where I was out in an IV for hydration. They monitored the contractions. And most importantly, they monitored our babies' heartbeats. They were strong. \n\nOver the next 2 days, blood flow was up and down. Contractions lessened some. They had me on procardia and it seemed to help. Dr wouldn't let me out of bed even to urinate so they would help me with the bedpan. Babies heart would beat on. \nWednesday overnight, the cramps became strong and painful. The doctor examined me in the morning and delivered devastating news: I was 1cm dilated and the placenta was bulging or pro-lapsing.  She told me I needed a c-section that day. \n\nBabies still had strong heartbeats and I wept at every state of prep for my 20 w c-section, knowing we would lose them.  I bawled through the epidural. I screamed as my wife hugged me in her matched grief. \n\nI delivered a perfect little son and daughter at 12:30pm on 10/5/17, and their hearts were still going. Our son, Leith Verdon, passed 10 minutes after delivery as I held him and his sister on my chest. Our daughter, Lyra Estelle, passed 2 hours later in my arms. \n\nMy wife and I are devastatingly heartbroken again. We held our babies, loved them, kissed their foreheads. Took as many pictures as we could in order to preserve their memory.  \n\nAnd we bawled as we said our final goodbyes to release them to the funeral home last night, 10/6/17.  They are being issued birth certificates and SS cards. And subsequently, we'll need to request the death certificates as well. \n\nWe don't know how to process all of this. No words seem to help right now but I needed to vent.  I can't even start to think about TTC again, but if anyone has been through anything similar, I would appreciate insight into the timeline of your own return to fertility. \n\nAgain, I'm sorry if I am posting this in the wrong thread or if it causes anyone else duress. This is our heart wrenching story. Please help us process it. Thank you so much for letting me vent, and for reading our story. \u2764\ufe0f \n", "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "ttcafterloss", "subreddit_id": "t5_34scd", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Loss of Twins at 20 weeks", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/ttcafterloss/comments/74xsut/loss_of_twins_at_20_weeks/"}, {"author": "mmmmmpopplers", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_text": null, "brand_safe": false, "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1507433061, "domain": "self.ttcafterloss", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/ttcafterloss/comments/74zh97/how_soon_after_miscarriage_will_see_lh_surge/", "id": "74zh97", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "locked": false, "num_comments": 7, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/ttcafterloss/comments/74zh97/how_soon_after_miscarriage_will_see_lh_surge/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1507526025, "score": 2, "selftext": "Pregnancy ended on September 27 and I bled for 6 days.

I had debilitating sickness when I was pregnant so I'm addition to fearing another loss, I am also anxious about having to spend another 9 month period feeling absolutely awful.  Moving forward to try again is terrifying but being stuck is excruciating. \n\nWe had Thanksgiving dinner (Canadian) with my family yesterday.  My younger sister is getting married in a few months and after going on and on about her wedding, asked me if I could send her all the info about my losses because she is meeting with her doctor in Jan to discuss getting pregnant after they get married. \n\nIt felt like a punch to the gut and a reminder of how long I've been on this path.  I never had a wedding, never had a big reason to celebrate and it was exciting that my parents were so happy when I announced I was pregnant.   I immediately felt so jealous and angry at the thought that she might bring home a healthy baby before me.   I felt like the script I had started writing in my head a year ago was being torn up in front of me. \n\nThis morning, I mentioned to my partner that it hurt to think that she might have children before us.   He became extremely angry at me, saying I was cruel and that Its awful that I can't be happy for other people.  He called me foolish and that I'm not owed a baby and life isn't fair so I need to suck it up.   He said that if I was going to think that way, I should not tell him because it makes him think less of me. \n\nI was shocked into silence and asked for some privacy to understand what had just happened.   I had never wished her I'll, I had just said it would suck.  We needed to leave to go to his mothers for another family dinner so he came back into the room and wanted to try and talk it out.  But I felt so vulnerable and was so hurt that I said I didn't want to keep fighting and that we should just get in the car.   When I am upset, it's hard for me talk it out right away because I get very emotional and struggle to express myself. \n\nIn the end, after a few back and forths, he left without me.   I feel awful as I love his mother and am embarrassed about my absence.  I'm ashamed that I can't be a better person and not compare my journey with other people. \n\nThis process is so hard - hard on my body, hard on me emotionally and hard on my relationship.   I wish he could understand that I don't want to be a jealous, angry or sad person but I am struggling with so many emotions and I need him to be a safe person to share them with.   I know that life isn't fair but I don't understand how he can view things so objectively.   Our babies keep dying, my body keeps failing us and everyone around us is moving forward.

No cause was determined and I still often blame myself. The baby was supposed to be my 3rd and final child. I\u2019m lucky enough to already be a mom of 2 awesome boys. It\u2019s been 6 months and I\u2019m still so angry and upset over what happened. It still feels surreal some days. A year ago I was the happiest I have ever been - I had just lost over 50 lbs and ran my first half marathon. Life was good. We talked about adding \u201cjust one more\u201d to our family for a long time and decided in November we would stop protecting and see what happened. I got pregnant that first cycle and found out on Christmas Day. It was all so perfect or so I had thought. Everything went great until my 16wk appt and they couldn\u2019t find s heart beat with the doppler. I was sent for an emergency ultrasound and to our surprise the baby was fine! Whew! The very next day I got a call from my doc saying my blood work came back 1 in 5 for trisomy 18. I had to get another blood test done and for 2 weeks I stressed out waiting for the results. Turns out, the baby DID not have trisomy 18. A few days before my anatomy scan I started spotting. I called my doctor and they told me to take it easy, I probably just overdid it. The day of my anatomy scan I felt really \u201coff\u201d. I couldn\u2019t get excited. Maybe I knew it was the end. When they brought the baby up on the screen I knew something was very wrong. My baby died. In comes the doctor to talk about labor or d&amp;e. 2 days later I had a d &amp; e. 3 weeks later a nurse from the doctor\u2019s office called to tell me my baby\u2019s pathology report came back \u201cnormal\u201d. I\u2019ve never cried and screamed so hard in my entire life. I actually woke up one of my son\u2019s from his nap and my other son told me I was scaring him. I never got help and my hospital never gave me info on grief. I wish I had and I know it\u2019s not too late. The summer was hard counting down the weeks I would have been. Seeing all the perfectly round baby bumps at the pool I take my boys to. All these women looked like they were due around the time I should have been due. My very good friend announced her pregnancy and then another good friend announced she\u2019s pregnant the same week as the other friend. Knives in the heart. I\u2019m happy for them but I\u2019m also very envious as well. The one thing that would help make me feel better, I\u2019ve been failing at - getting pregnant again. I\u2019m miserable. I put weight on. Nothing makes me happy anymore. I can\u2019t even go to the beach for a few days with my family without thinking of how I should have a newborn with us. My due date was last month and no one remembered. I\u2019m only happy when I\u2019m drunk or sleeping. I\u2019ve been nasty to my husband. My marriage is on the rocks because of all of this. I\u2019m not the happy, loving wife and mother I was a year ago. This loss has really ruined me. I don\u2019t see light at the end of the tunnel. I start getting hopeful and then my period shows up. I thought for sure I would be pregnant by now...Why am I having problems getting pregnant when it was so easy a year ago? Will I ever be happy again? Will I ever get out of this funk and live again? \n\nThanks to whoever read my rant.... having a bad weekend....

The initial shock of it has passed and I now find myself learning to navigate the waves of grief that come over me. My husband has been absolutely amazing and I don't know where I'd be without him. Our relationship and love for each other has gotten stronger through this, but I wish this wasn't our path. I am a really healthy and fit person, did everything I was supposed to, and never in a million years thought this would happen. While I know my son is gone, there are days I wake up and think \"Fuck, how is this my life?!\" Like, really world? I have my good days and they're increasing in frequency, but damn when the sadness and anger set in, it's rough. I'm trying to take care of myself...get back into cooking healthier, exercise, pick up some new hobbies, but there's always an underlying emptiness and sadness. I love my job, but my workplace is sometimes difficult as there are several new moms. Just brings up so many emotions, as you all know. \n\nMy husband and I just started trying again, and it's a lot tougher emotionally this time around. It's only our 2nd month trying but we conceived really quickly the first time and I have this lingering fear in the back of my mind that something is wrong with me. I can get into this spiral that there must be something wrong with me for this to happen even though all the tests I've had done have come back normal. We never got an answer for our loss (we didn't do an autopsy bc in the moment it felt unthinkable and our midwife said they often don't turn up any answers...it was the right decision in the moment, but now I sometimes regret that), and I don't do well with the \"sometimes shit just happens\" thing. So there's a lack of confidence in my body and a strong dose of fear mixed in with all this. \n\nThere aren't a ton of resources in my area, which makes this more frustrating.

I was very, very overweight so I decided to put TTC on hold and focus on weight loss instead. I've struggled with my weight my entire life so after many failed attempts to lose the weight myself I decided to have weight loss surgery. I went into this knowing I'd have to wait for 18 months before getting pregnant. It was hard choice to make but in the end I knew my best shot at a healthy pregnancy (or any pregnancy) would be if I lost weight.\n\nI had the surgery in March. By August I'd lost over 100lbs. And I was pregnant. We'd been careful but clearly not careful enough. I was over the moon because I've wanted to be a mom for as long as I can remember. I mean, I had lists of potential baby names as a teenager. Like physical, printed out lists. Anyway, I knew it was too soon after surgery but I was determined to keep myself and the baby healthy.\n\nBut since I'm here you know that I failed. Baby was measuring two weeks small at my first ultrasound but there was a heartbeat. I was nervous about this but found ways to be optimistic and carried on planning for our new addition. Three weeks later I woke up one morning feeling like something was wrong. I went to the doctor and another ultrasound showed no heartbeat. I'm sure you're all familiar the tidal wave of emotions that followed. \n\nIt's been almost three weeks since then and I'm having a much harder time than I anticipated. The hardest thing is that, because of the surgery, I still have to wait another YEAR before we can try again. I'm 32. I'll be 33 before we can try again and 34 before a baby is born...if a baby is born. This was all true before the miscarriage and I'd made my peace with it. But now...all I want is to get pregnant again *immediately*. And just when I think I'm healing I have a set back. Today my cousin announced that she's pregnant and my heart broke all over again. I want to be happy for her but all I can feel is broken. I'm completely broken.\n\nI'm beginning to panic about my age, about the pain of waiting, and about this broken feeling that I know isn't going anywhere anytime soon. Some days I'm fine and some days it hurts so much I want to tear my own skin off. I'm starting to doubt I'll ever be a mother. And I just can't cope with that possibility. It's killing me. It's all I've ever wanted and I can't imagine life without at least one kiddo. And every time I try to I just end up in tears.\n\nI'm sorry this is long. But thank you for listening.\n", "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "ttcafterloss", "subreddit_id": "t5_34scd", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Having a hard time coping.
