I've been lurking for weeks and started posting comments here and there, so I'm finally introducing myself.  My husband and I were eagerly anticipating the arrival of our first baby at the end of August 2019, but ended up going through the nightmare of termination after our son was diagnosed with trisomy 13.  I'm about a month out and still a wreck, obviously, but I'm starting to think about actively trying to conceive again.  Right now I'm desperate to get my cycle back and wondering if the heavy spotting I'm having is actually a light post-termination period.  I'm sure you can all relate to the maddening waiting period where you try to figure out what the hell your body is doing.  I ordered a TempDrop last week (so, you know, maybe it will arrive in June or so?) because my chronic insomnia has always made traditional temping useless.  It was a splurge but after what we've been through, I decided I didn't care.  I'm going to be 36 in a few months and I need all the useful data I can get.\n\nAnyway, while it's shitty to be in this situation, it's nice to have a community that gets it.  I had to take a long break from Reddit and I can't bear to visit my August and September bumper subs long enough to even submit a farewell post.  I've been trying to write a TFMR story for BabyBumps because it's part of the range of pregnancy experiences and I found other users' stories helpful, but I've only been able to write a little bit at a time.  Maybe one day I'll put that mess out there.\n\nShout-out to\u00a0/u/PokeMyEyes for listening to me when I was facing the procedure, sharing her experience, and checking in with me later.

I called my on-call Obgyn and after some discussion she insisted I go to the ER. Of course the concern was retained tissue or an ectopic that hadn\u2019t dissolved with the miscarriage (as my hcg is 0). \n\nSo anyway, after a pelvic exam, bloods, and ultrasound, they can\u2019t find anything wrong. They literally said everything looked perfect on the ultrasound. They did see that my cervix is irritated which was noted during the pelvic exam. They sent me home and basically told me they have no idea why I\u2019m in pain. \n\nI will have the information sent to my OB tomorrow and we will discuss later this week. I\u2019m just alarmed with the type of pain that nothing is showing up as a red flag. \n\nAlso: neg for UTI, White blood cells are normal, no unusual discharge and none found during exam. So doesn\u2019t seem to be BV or yeast related. And I wasn\u2019t far along, about 5weeks, 6 at most. \n\nSo it leaves me wondering if this is normal to experience after a natural mc?

And the moment that I get pregnant, I will not think twice up about these things I'm about to complain about. \n\nI've been on this journey for a year and a half now. And I'm sick of always thinking but what if I'm pregnant by then? Here is a list of my things: \n\n1. Avoiding sushi dates during the TWW. It is what it is, but sometimes I want sushi and decide to pass just in case. \n\n2. Trips and Vacations. Anytime we plan a trip, visiting family or a weekend getaway I wonder can I participate in activities we've planned if I'm pregnant? So we shouldn't plan to go ziplining Hawaii?\n\n3. Doing something about my acne. This one is frustrating. Over the last year my skin has really gotten out of control but so much of the acne medication/regimens are not pregnancy friendly. So I'm not pregnant but still can't really do anything because who knows I might be. \n\n4. Drinking juice and caffiene intake. I make juice at home, not for some crazy diet or fad, I genuinely like the taste of fresh juice. Fun fact though, can't have unpasteurized juices if I'm pregnant. I also drink coffee  which is still below the allowed amount for pregnancy,  but no really, should I be drinking this right now? \n\n5. Buying furtniture. I literally won't buy things for my house because when I have a baby I'll need the space for the babys things. Why buy shelves when that's the perfect spot for my baby's changing table?\n\n6. Getting a new job. Anytime I've wanted to get a new job, I've convinced myself it's not the right time because I'm comfortable and they trust me so I don't have to worry about \"proving myself\" at a new company. \n\n7. Really expensive gym membership. I cancelled my really expensive gym membership because every month during the TWW I started taking it easy just in case I was pregnant. \n\nSo here I am a year later, missing out on sushi, worrying about upcoming trips, with frustrating breakouts, drinking questionable juices and caffeine, with random empty spaces in the house, at the same job, getting out of shape, all without a baby to bring home with me.\n\nDo I sounds crazy or what? What kinds of things do you put on hold during this process? \n\n", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "ttcafterloss", "subreddit_id": "t5_34scd", "subreddit_subscribers": 4883, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Tired if putting my life on hold", "updated_utc": 1554346860, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/ttcafterloss/comments/b675p8/tired_if_putting_my_life_on_hold/"}, {"author": "AutoModerator", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_6l4z3", "author_patreon_flair": false, "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1553710148, "domain": "self.ttcafterloss", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/ttcafterloss/comments/b67k7i/ttcafterloss_daily_discussion_thread_2_march_27/", "gildings": {"gid_1": 0, "gid_2": 0, "gid_3": 0}, "id": "b67k7i", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 10, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/ttcafterloss/comments/b67k7i/ttcafterloss_daily_discussion_thread_2_march_27/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1553710149, "score": 1, "selftext": "**How are you doing today?

I\u2019ve learned a lot  \n\n\nI\u2019m at about 6weeks 4 days with a nonviable pregnancy, and spent yesterday at the hospital getting multiple scans and tests run. \nEverything was pretty unclear, but it\u2019s definitely not viable, and they scheduled an urgent D&amp;C for Sunday. \nIt might be a MMC but the sac they saw was very irregular. \nI\u2019m terrified it\u2019s going to be molar. And they said that\u2019s a strong possibility. \n\nI\u2019m so sad and shattered but not really surprised. I hadn\u2019t felt \u201cpregnant enough\u201d or like this was real - I\u2019m really glad I trusted my intuition and tried to look into things earlier than my Dr had suggested. \n\nI had been told by a few doctors and specialists I would need to undergo IVF to get pregnant. My partner and I have been trying (some tracking, some NTNP) for a year without thinking it would ever work. \nI have moved cities and need a new GP anyway, so I\u2019ve been on a wait list to see one who is apparently great with queer / assisted fertility situations. That appointment is coming up on the 8th April and I was planning to pursue as much fertility as I could afford ASAP. \n\nSo I was so, so shocked when I tested on day 27 of last cycle (when my period normally arrives) and got what I thought was an evaporation line. But over the next few days we kept taking more tests and they were definite positives.  \n\nMy partner has been so so excited, he had the best reaction to a surprise positive that I could have asked for. He\u2019s so devastated now. \n\nMy test lines were super slow to develop though, and never got super dark. \nI saw my partner\u2019s Dr really early on to confirm with bloods. With a history of endometriosis (laparoscopy about 4 years ago) I knew I was at risk for ectopic so I was super nervous. I also have had massive hemorrhagic luteal cysts rupture (February last year) and pain from a non-hemorrhagic one on my left ovary currently. \n\nThe bloods were doubling but low - 100s to 200s in just under 24 hours. (I wish I\u2019d pushed her to keep taking them in the interim. I\u2019m super nervous now not knowing my HCG.)\nPartner\u2019s-doctor said everything was fine and to book in an early scan for 8 weeks. The anxiety of not knowing if this was growing in the right place was really messing with my head!\n\nThis week I hit 6 weeks and started having persistent and intrusive left side pain. I waited a couple of days then called the scan place - they said to come in early, they could always re-do later on. I\u2019m so glad they encouraged me. \n\nWhen I went in I was already sure they weren\u2019t going to see a baby. But I wasn\u2019t really prepared for the fear of a molar. \n\nWe are both so scared about this coming procedure and the results. I started spotting a little today which I\u2019m weirdly happy about, it feels better thinking maybe my body is getting ready to let this go. \nI had known I needed to get a D&amp;C anyway as my endometrial lining is too thick. So hopefully this will help with my health too. \n\nSomewhere in there I\u2019m still just THRILLED that conception happened at all - it seems like I do ovulate, he does make at least some swimmers, at least an occasional egg makes it down the tubes, my uterus is receptive (too receptive maybe), and through all of this I haven\u2019t spotted at all so it seems like my cervix can do the job. I honestly can\u2019t believe any of that and it\u2019s amazing. But right now I\u2019m overwhelmed and it\u2019s hard to look on the good side with all of the scary possibilities of the next few months. \n\nI know I just have to wait and see what this D&amp;C shows. The thought of the pregnancy symptoms  continuing until my levels drop is making me so sad. \n\nDoes anyone have any tips for how to proceed now? \nOr any advice on resources for my partner? I want to support him as well as him caring for me. \n\nI know I will need my hormones monitored after the D&amp;C and that it will be really different depending on whether it\u2019s molar etc. \nI plan to push the hospital to order bloods in the interim until I am called back to their clinic (in a fortnight) for the results and consultation about next steps. \nDoes anyone know how often it would be ideal to monitor HCG? \n\nIs there anything else I should be keeping in mind to ask? \nWhile we wait to TTC again, any suggestions on steps we can take eg tests? I\u2019m worried about my partners morphology due to past smoking, tight jeans, cycling etc. Is that worth looking into if we are waiting, for instance?\n\n\ud83d\udc95\n\n", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "ttcafterloss", "subreddit_id": "t5_34scd", "subreddit_subscribers": 4894, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "First post and sad to be here", "updated_utc": 1554428698, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/ttcafterloss/comments/b6ry62/first_post_and_sad_to_be_here/"}, {"author": "fitnurse_foodie", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_3i1s2soz", "author_patreon_flair": false, "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1553837766, "domain": "self.ttcafterloss", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/ttcafterloss/comments/b6tgte/90_day_cycles_after_dc_mmc/", "gildings": {"gid_1": 0, "gid_2": 0, "gid_3": 0}, "id": "b6tgte", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 11, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/ttcafterloss/comments/b6tgte/90_day_cycles_after_dc_mmc/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1553837767, "score": 5, "selftext": "First post here, my friend suggested this sub because she found so much support here.\n\nLong story short, I had a very abnormal 12 week scan and no heartbeat on the follow up 1 week later. They scheduled a D&amp;C in September and things seemed to be fine initially (about 4 days of moderate bleeding, minimal cramping). We decided to wait until at least 1-2 periods to TTC since previously I have had a regular 35 day cycle, but each cycle since D&amp;C have been 90 days, so 2 cycles so far. I would go to my OB after 10-12 weeks of no bleeding and negative preg tests and he suggested progesterone twice but magically I would have my period the week after without taking anything. \n\nAfter 1st period I started using OPKs and they were all over the place. High for 10 days then low for a couple so I would stop testing and when I had a negative preg test I did the OPK again and it would fluctuate high again. I did notice a darker \"peak\" level one day at CD 75 but had another peak a week later, finally had my period on day 92. OB said my hormones need more time to regulate so I'm on CD 35 and still having fluctuating/low OPKs. I started BBT this month but that is unreliable since I work night shifts. Also just started on synthroid for hypothyroid that was just diagnosed 1 month ago, OB said likely pregnancy related and I may not need meds in 6 months to a year.\nAlso should mention that I used to have a lot of noticeable CM during cycles and sore boobs around ovulation pre-pregnancy and now I have no symptoms the past 6 months.\n\nAny suggestions? I'm kind of just accepting the possibility that my cycles are now 90 days long but I'm afraid of missing a peak OPK or that I may not be ovulating. OB says if I'm having periods I should be ovulating but I'm not used to such long cycles and lack of my typical ovulation signs. I know everyone says to stop stressing out but I felt so in tune with my body before and now everything feels so out of whack.

She was just a very big plus in the package\n\nwe had a few arguments after about the first year nothing out of hand. a baby was always in talks me as a person with no kids it took me a little bit to warm up to the thought just out of pure ignorance and nerves i wanted to be overly prepared in life to maintain a child. \n\nwe had our discrenpancys at times i was depressed after losing a job and not having income, at one point we would fight so much that it led me to entertain other females via text but nothing ever physical but we patched those holes in our relationship. \nonly once did our arguing get somewhat physical and it wasnt something like a fight or me hitting her. \n-------------------\nPREGNANCY \n-------------------\nabout 3 months ago we found out she was pregnant, we were both beyond excited because two months prior we started actually trying to concive. Every chance we could get we were intimate and it payed off, she got on a cycle of clomid and bam a baby was on the way. \n\ni was in shock when she annouced it to me, the whole week prior i seen the change in her start to take ahold and i knew something was up and i was right. \ni wasnt overly excited my life flashed before my eyes i didnt know how to react she found it odd but i re assured her that everything was fine and i was indeed excited. \n\nwe shared the news and my side of the family were ecstatic , her side not so much. her mom cried out of anger, her moms husband wished death on the child. \ni was there for her and told her not to worry that the baby wouldnt need for anything and that we didnt really need them like that. \n\nwe started our journey. a few weeks in i saw a change that wasnt plesent in her. she was very very tired always sleeping and that cut down our contact since she lived with her mom and i lived with my brother. \ni was putting the ducks in order to move us out and into our own place and was transitioning into a newer higher paying job. \n\nmy mistake was that i took it a bit personal, i didnt really know much about the female body and how it works while preganant i just found it odd that she didnt really bother to talk to me as much as she did prior to being pregnant. \n\none day she snaps, she starts telling me that i was worthless and that we were better off as co parents via text. that same day she rushed out her home and fell off the top of three steps and scraped her hand and knee. \nshe was about two months at this point. \n\nwe went to one more appointment and the doctor gave us more pictures and a due date. \n\nafter a week or two it comes to last friday she was sleeping i texted her and when she awoke she replyed to the text and went off on me and blocked my number. this is something she did almost regularly when she was mad at me and i didnt think much of it . another couple hours or a day of being blocked then some love and affection after is what i told myself. \n\nfriday turned to monday with no contact, i left a bunch of messages no replys. i then proceeded to contact her mom (me and her never seen eye to eye but were cordial) her mom blocked me. \n\nmy gf blocked me on every thing she could find, blocked my sister and mother as well which i found odd. \nso i started to lost my senses a bit and started to use every avenue i had to contact her and she finally gave in with one reply:\nafter the fall i felt something wasnt right, there is no baby, i need you to move on with your life. \n\nthis shattered my whole being, everything about me felt like it died after i read those words. i cried and sobbed and felt a pain i never thought was possible to feel. it hurt to let out the energy in those tears and vocal gasps for air. i felt my heart crack. \n\nafter a few more trys to contact her she decided to change her number. \n\ni cant pop up at her house because she wont come out and her mom would call the police on me, i cant go to her school because they will also call the police on me so im stuck without any other avenue to contact her because shell just block me without a chance to talk. \n\nher story doesnt really add up to me just due to the fact that the doctor said everything was fine, i just want answers i just want to talk i was baiscally told a life changing thing and left to figure it all out by myself. \n\ni do not resent her im not angry with her i dont blame her for the fall if thats really what did it, i just want her and her daughter back in my life so i have some love to get my through this traumatic experience. \n\nwhat do i do?\n", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "ttcafterloss", "subreddit_id": "t5_34scd",

I had a really difficult IUD remove a few years ago and wonder if I should expect something similar (although at least I'll be medicated this time and this OB seems much more skilled).\n\nAlso, we are trying to decide if we should have the embryo's chromosomes analyzed.

Finally naturally miscarried one week ago today. I joined this thread without knowing if I was ever going to try again.\n\nOne of the most hurtful things people asked me as soon as I told them we had miscarried was \"are you going to try again?\". It was like this baby didn't even matter or exist. I would always politely say we haven't discussed it yet. Or that we weren't ready to make that decision just yet. \n\nMy husband and I had not been planning on having children of our own. He has 3 from a previous marriage and we were content with our little family as it was. So when we found out we were pregnant we were shocked and for a time very unsure of how we felt. Then the miscarriage happened. We have talked about maybe just returning back to our old plan of no children for us. Grieve this child and heal, but focus our energy elsewhere. \n\nWell last night at a George Strait concert he begins to sing I Saw God Today. The song is about a man becoming a father. Before I knew it we were both in tears. We immediately knew how much our hearts hurt and yearned for a child. When we got home from the concert we finally had our first real conversation about how we felt and what we wanted. We will still probably wait at least 6 months before we try again. Because we realize we still need to grieve for our baby. Also, having had weightloss surgery less than a year ago I don't believe my body is ready to support a healthy pregnancy just yet. But at least now we have had a real conversation about how we feel and now we know we what to try again.

I had a huge breakdown in November, I really wanted to get a BFP by the time the original due date was (December 20), and I had a feeling it just wasn't going to happen. It didnt. It still hasn't.\n\nBut, this time last year, I didn't know it, but I was pregnant. I wouldn't take a test until April 16, 18DPO, because I was loosely tracking and didnt notice. We found out in May that I had a blight ovum and was MC'ing. \n\nI feel like we'll never have that moment again. I have undergone blood work, ultrasounds, tests, homeopathic appointments to appease my \"naturopath\" MIL.... nothing. I am healthy. We ordered an at home sperm test and got the low range of normal, but I cant control my husband. He is a little overweight, he owns a restaurant and is a chef there, so he's always hot, and hes working 5-6 days a week 8-14 hour days. \n\nNothing on his end will change. He used to smoke weed, and has decreased, but hasn't quit. He \"doesnt have time\" to work out, and he never gets enough sleep. So, I feel like why bother? \n\nSince my November meltdown, I had positive mantras, I stepped back from tracking, I stepped back from social media, but this month, I just crumbled. I had a wonderful chart, I got hopeful, and I was crushed... again. I know it takes the toll on my husband as well, but he only has the instant shock of, oh got my period. Not the build up and let down every single month. The positive mantras clearly havent helped. I cant help but feel like I will never be a mother, and honestly, what's the point then? I work 6 days a week, 5 days at my job that I drive an hour to every day just to pay my 1300$/month in student loans, and then one day waitressing at his restaurant... for what? I am alone every night but one night a week, I hardly have any friends here, because I moved to his home town and he bought the rest shortly after I moved here, so I never really \"got in\" with his friends, and I am shy, so I dont really meet people that easily. The 2 friends I do have own their own business' and are just as busy as my husband. \n\nI just feel so down. I dont know why I am wasting my life, if I'll never be a mother, what's the point? I have done everything in my power so far, my midwife does not think its me and while she said I can do an HSG and further, she thinks it is just a matter of time. I went off BC christmas 2016, it took months for my period to regulate (like 8 months), and 14 months to get pregnant. after the MC, it was months again for my period to regulate, and here we are, 10 months later, and again, nothing. We wanted 2-3 kids, and here I am, over 2 years off BC, turning 32 in May, and childless. \n\nI cant even go on facebook, instagram, snapchat, because as happy as I am for my friends with kids, my eyes well up every time they send me videos... because it seems that will never be me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThis got long, I am sorry. I feel like my husband is scared every time I am sad, so I stopped talking to him about it, because I know he is sad as well. He would be literally the best father, hes the best uncle and god father... and I probably will never allow him to be a father. I am contemplating going to therapy, but my family was always really hush hush about every thing, and even though depression runs in my family, therapy seems to be taboo and I was never raised with it being acceptable. i dont even know where to start.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI know if you're on this sub, you have your own problems, and I really do try and be positive for people, but even the facebook groups I am part of, every time I see a BFP, I am happy for them, but so angry at the same time. \n\nThanks for letting me vent &lt;3", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "ttcafterloss", "subreddit_id": "t5_34scd", "subreddit_subscribers": 4898, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "This time last year, I was pregnant.", "updated_utc": 1554489245, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/ttcafterloss/comments/b81yrn/this_time_last_year_i_was_pregnant/"}, {"author": "AutoModerator", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_6l4z3", "author_patreon_flair": false, "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1554142212, "domain": "self.ttcafterloss", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/ttcafterloss/comments/b869mj/ttcafterloss_daily_discussion_thread_2_april_01/", "gildings": {"gid_1": 0, "gid_2": 0, "gid_3": 0}, "id": "b869mj", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 17, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/ttcafterloss/comments/b869mj/ttcafterloss_daily_discussion_thread_2_april_01/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1554142214, "score": 2, "selftext": "**How are you doing today?

I was nervous but also excited. I did not allow myself to get too excited because from the start, I just felt something was wrong. I felt better when I saw the baby on my first ultrasound and every time I heard the heartbeat on the doppler. On March 28th I was about 19 weeks and went in for my anatomy scan. At that time we found out that there was no heartbeat and that the baby stopped growing at around 16 weeks 4 days. I didn\u2019t really feel anything at first. I met with a few doctors, had blood drawn and laminaria put into my cervix for the D&amp;E the next day. Everything went smoothly and I\u2019ve been at home shifting between feeling fine and feeling really depressed and wanting to hurt myself (I wouldn\u2019t act on it, it\u2019s just a feeling). My boyfriend doesn\u2019t care about the loss at all.

It hurts so much, I don\u2019t know how to cope. I\u2019ve been drinking and taking anxiety medication because it helps me forget. I just want this feeling to go away. I want my baby back.
