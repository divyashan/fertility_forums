I just received the results of their chromosomal testing, trisomy 13 and they were most likely identical twin girls. Everything is raw still, we wanted girls so badly, my husband is an identical twin so it hit hard that their lives were not meant to be. We are waiting for our genetics counseling appointment in March. We are waiting to try but of course I refuse birth control and my husband refuses condoms and didn\u2019t pull out every time. We are educated but irresponsible at this point, no excuses. \n\nLast Tuesday my urine pregnancy tests were still very faint positive from my pregnancy. I used the amazon one and a Walmart one. Both very faint. I had blood work at my follow up OB appt on Wednesday and I was told I was not pregnant (I was not given my hcg level). Yesterday I started spotting which I read after a tmfr, a period will be very light. I am crazy hopeful and neurotic despite being a nurse and knowing I shouldn\u2019t hope, the little girl that just wants my baby inside of me is so hopeful it is implantation bleeding. I know it\u2019s not so I took a test this morning to help ease my mind. The Walmart test was positive, not super dark but definitely pink and not really faint like the one last week. I didn\u2019t use a fmu. I took a First Response (because my bathroom is a pharmacy with multiple tests just waiting for use) and it was extremely faint but this one I didn\u2019t have much urine left in me so I didn\u2019t soak it like I would have liked. \n\nSo here I am, I know it is likely just a chemical pregnancy, in my heart of hearts I pray (and I\u2019m not a praying kind of girl) that it\u2019s for real. I\u2019m scared I didn\u2019t give my body time to recover. I\u2019m scared I\u2019ll be so disappointed when the lines disappear in a few days. I know I can\u2019t tell my husband because it will just hurt both of us when I realize it isn\u2019t real. I have no symptoms, and I\u2019ve had a chemical pregnancy before and I know how upsetting it is going to be but I can\u2019t help but be just the slightest bit hopeful. All I have is hope.

The baby\u2019s heart, intestines and liver are outside it\u2019s body. 4.5mm nuchal, Hydrops, a severe heart defect, and chromosomal abnormalities - tri 18 is suspected. They went in today for a follow up with a genetic counselor and a CVS. They were told that although the baby is alive and growing, there\u2019s only a 5% chance of surviving to term and if he survives birth he\u2019d require tens of grueling surgeries, after which he\u2019d live probably only 18 months or less. They don\u2019t think they can cope with that for a number of reasons, including a young and impressionable LC. That said she\u2019s really struggling with the decision to TFMR and would feel most comfortable with an induction but apparently the doctor she saw said they don\u2019t do that until 24 weeks (NY). Is this accurate? \n\nAre there any resources that would be of use to her in advance and after a TFMR? I know there\u2019s a great Facebook support group and I\u2019ve made note of the link and will pass it on. \n\nAlso what can I as a friend do to help her through this - I\u2019ve been watching her LC so she can go to appointments and offering words of comfort and support where I can but it\u2019s such a tough position I struggle to find the right thing to say. Our LC are a month apart and I am due just 5 weeks before she is.

And triggery. \nSo unfortunately for me, my induction did not go as smoothly as we would of hoped.\nWe had our consult Monday where we went through what would happen and I was given mifegyne to shut down the placenta.\nI then returned to the hospital Wednesday lunch to start the induction with misoprostol. Having had this before my D&amp;C\u2019s I was not too keen on the idea and was vocal about requiring pain relief. At first the nurse was reluctant but after reading my notes gave me oral morphine. Unfortunately this didn\u2019t do much so moved to IV morphine. I had been given 3 doses of misoprostol by this point without much happening, and I was starting to worry how long it was going to take. Luckily things started moving a bit about an hour after the third dose and I delivered the baby fairly quickly. The nurses were amazing and respected our wishes to not see anything (baby was beginning to deteriorate due to dying over a week before) or know the sex. I was actually really surprised at how easily this part went and how relieved I felt. \nThe pain really subsided at this point and they put me on some other IV drug to encourage the uterus to release the placenta. Unfortunately this did not go to plan, my temp began to rise and had a couple of uncomfortable physical exams. They managed to manually remove most of the placenta but given my fever, bleeding and risk of retained products they sent me to theatre at 3am.\nIt sounds like a  horrific experience when I write it out but my husband was by my side the whole way and all the staff were amazing, and answered all my annoying questions. This coupled with having had surgery before helped it not be as traumatic.\nSo I stayed in hospital for an extra night for an iron infusion and IV antibiotics, but happily left just before lunch Friday. \n\nFor anyone reading this before going through the same thing please remember this is probably a worse case scenario. My body just seems to respond dramatically to drugs and doesn\u2019t want to let pregnancies go. \n\nAs for the whole grieving process. We decided not to see or find out the sex. I know others don\u2019t, but I find it hard to think of the actual baby.  Possibly due to our previous losses making us disconnected. I grieve for the idea of what this baby could have been and the few plans we had made for it, and I\u2019m not sure seeing would help that. I also grieve our hopes to have a family and all the anxiety that future pregnancies will bring. We are getting momentos made, I\u2019m not 100% sure what they are but better to have them packed away than not at all. \nWe decided to go with cremation and they get scattered in a special area at the local memorial gardens. \n\nNow is time to rest and reflect. We have been referred to a repeat loss clinic by our GP and will have a few weeks wait for results from the hospital. The next few months will just be for us, no baby making pressure. \n\n", "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "ttcafterloss", "subreddit_id": "t5_34scd", "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Induction of 2nd trimester loss- 3rd consecutive mmc", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/ttcafterloss/comments/7zmbu6/induction_of_2nd_trimester_loss_3rd_consecutive/"}, {"author": "Lexielo", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "brand_safe": false, "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1519386078, "domain": "self.ttcafterloss", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/ttcafterloss/comments/7zngdu/trigger_warning_blighted_ovum/", "id": "7zngdu", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_css_class": "trigger", "link_flair_richtext": [{"e": "text", "t": "Trigger - enter type here"}], "link_flair_template_id": "7465d7b8-7120-11e4-9568-12313d14791d", "link_flair_text": "Trigger - enter type here", "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "richtext", "locked": false, "num_comments": 2, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/ttcafterloss/comments/7zngdu/trigger_warning_blighted_ovum/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1519493340, "rte_mode": "markdown", "score": 1, "selftext": "I found out yesterday that I have a blighted ovum and the pregnancy is not viable.

(This is our fourth miscarriage). They offered expectant management but I knew i wanted it over so scheduled a termination for yesterday afternoon. It was really hard and so shitty but it was fast and now it\u2019s over. Feeling very much relieved. I wanted to take a little time and write my (someone positive) termination without anesthesia story because the internet is awash with really crappy stories. This is somewhat detailed so trigger warning ahead. But I couldn\u2019t find anything that wasn\u2019t doomsday levels of fear inducing. \n\nWhen I was the midwife on Tuesday she told me I was absolutely a candidate for a termination without anesthesia. She told me it is tough but so am I. The cost savings and the speed of procedure without anesthesia were big pros for me. She gave me my consent form and prescribed meds for me. I asked for Xanax to help with anxiety. I absolutely 100% recommend this. I had never had Xanax before and found it hugely helpful. \n\nAbout two hours before the procedure, I was so nervous that I started vomiting. The internet is full of people who say it was the worst thing that has ever happened to them. Honestly, it wasn\u2019t fun and it was very painful but it lasts for only a few minutes. I took antibiotics. An hour before the procedure I took a Xanax. I could feel it kicking in within 10-15 minutes and I felt my body calm right down. Then, in car ride over, I took two norcos, an ibuprofen and a med to help with nausea.\n\nWhen I arrived,  I asked to wait in a treatment room and not in waiting room. Honestly- they can almost always make this happen and it is the best. There is no reason for you to have to wait with pregnant women when you\u2019re experiencing a loss. They met me and took my vitals and asked me to use restroom and got me settled into a room with my husband. The doctor came in and told me what was about to happen.\n\nI asked several questions: will I have to see anything? No. I explained that I didn\u2019t want to see anything at all. Can I listen to music? Absolutely. Can you insert an IUD? Yes. I told him that I was feeling very sad and would likely cry and he said that it was ok. He told me when to stop him and to try and stay so still.\n\nThen we started. I undressed from waist down except for socks and put headphones on. I can not recommend them enough. I put my legs up in stirrups. He inserted a speculum and clamped my cervix. (No pain). Then he did two shots of anesthesia to my cervix. A little cramping.\n\nWe waited a few minutes for them to take effect and then the procedure began. This part wasnt very uncomfortable to start. Then it became Deeply crampy and I could feel/hear the suctioning. I was blown away by how deeply it hurt (as in, in my uterus- I had an unmedicated vaginal induction in 2015- this is nothin in comparison)(manageable; just like \u201cI stubbed my toe and dropped my phone on it at the same time and very intense, but the emotional pain was very bad) and was about to ask to take a break when they told me it was almost done. I closed my eyes and counted back from ten and it was over. I cried during the procedure. They checked to make sure I wasn\u2019t bleeding excessively. I told them that I couldn\u2019t have the IUD inserted today (I was done). and had me lay down on bed for 10-15 minutes. My husband got me a cool cloth for my forehead and I experienced some bad cramping which went away in less than ten minutes. We packed a thermos of juice and I had some when I sat up. My husband helped me get dressed and less than 15 minutes after procedure we left.\n\nIt was hard (but more emotionally hard than physically. But this week has been so hard emotionally that \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0f). It was so fast. The doctor was so kind to me. I took one more norco when the first set wore off and since that no pain and very little bleeding. I spent afternoon under my heating pad and being waited on hand and foot. \n\nI\u2019m so glad I elected to have an in-office termination and I hope this helps a woman who is making a decision. The midwife said the big factor is motivation. For me, I wanted to be at home as quickly as I could be and with my family. I wanted my husband to be there. I wanted to have it be a low stress experience. So in office was a good choice for me.\n\n \n ", "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "ttcafterloss", "subreddit_id": "t5_34scd", "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "And just like that, I\u2019m not pregnant any more (warning, termination)", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/ttcafterloss/comments/7zoa9o/and_just_like_that_im_not_pregnant_any_more/"}, {"author": "smf88", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "brand_safe": false, "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1519401460, "domain": "self.ttcafterloss", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/ttcafterloss/comments/7zp1fu/intro_longish_oops_mmc_with_2/", "id": "7zp1fu", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_css_class": "intro", "link_flair_richtext": [{"e": "text", "t": "Intro"}], "link_flair_text": "Intro", "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "richtext", "locked": false, "num_comments": 15, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/ttcafterloss/comments/7zp1fu/intro_longish_oops_mmc_with_2/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1519505534, "rte_mode": "markdown", "score": 1, "selftext": "Hi everyone,\n\nJust thought I\u2019d introduce myself - I think I\u2019ll be here for the next few months!\n\nI have a 2yr old and we had been trying since last summer to conceive our second, and were so so excited to get the positive this January!\nAnyways, had my dating scan on Wednesday (was supposed to be 10-11w) and it was measuring a month behind and no heartbeat.

We'd just gotten married a month beforehand, and we had already beautiful little boy who was 16 months old and completely unplanned. We had only tried for two months, so you can imagine how excited we were to have gotten pregnant again so quickly. I tested positive on Father's Day and got to give him the happy news... yeah, that perfect.\n\nWhen I was about 9 weeks along I started streaking pink when I wiped, and then the bleeding came. We were panicking and rushed to the ER to find out that I had a subchorionic hematoma. The baby was fine, though the HB was elevated to 191. My OB decided it was possibly due to stress and we would keep an eye on it, but overall everything was fine.\n\nMy OB does a blood test to check for chromosomal abnormalities as well as the gender at 9 weeks, so I had that test done which came back inconclusive. This was considered normal as sometimes there's not enough fetal DNA in the mothers blood at that point, so we retested at 12 weeks with the same result. I was given an appointment to see a genetic consultant at 15 weeks, but then further disaster struck in the form of Hurricane Irma and we weren't able to get in until I was just shy of 19 weeks.\n\nSeptember 28th, the second worse day of our lives. We went in for the genetic consultation and the ultrasound showed severe abnormalities.\n\nTrisomy 13.\n\nIncompatible with life.\n\nA 1 in 16,000 chance, you were struck by lightning.\n\nYou can choose to continue with your pregnancy, the baby MIGHT survive long enough for you to hold it.\n\nI had an amnio done so we could double check the diagnosis, but the doctor was firm. Trisomy 13, and a very bad case of it at that.\n\nOctober 3rd, the worse day of our lives. We terminated our very loved and wanted baby, because the thought of forcing it to suffer unnecessarily was more heartbreaking than knowing it would die. We chose not to find out the sex after everything was said and done, even when we were called back to confirm the diagnosis via the amnio results.\n\nAnd now here we are. The baby was due Feb 28, just 5 days from now. I should be a giant beach ball complaining about aches and bloat and dying to go into labor, instead all I feel is this intense emptiness in the place where life once was.\n\nWe're TTC again, this is our second month of trying. I know that the average time it takes couples to get pregnant is between 6 to 12 months, but we were hoping so much that I would be pregnant again around this time.

We\u2019ve been married for 10 years and have a 2.5 year old daughter. It took about 4 years of TTC to have her (though we admittedly weren\u2019t in a big hurry most of that time and were mostly NTNP). \n\nThis time around we lazily tried again for around a year, then got pregnant the first cycle we were really intentional about it. \n\nEverything seemed to be going well. Ultrasounds at 9, 11 and 13 weeks all looked good and the baby had measured normally each time. My second trimester screening tests all came back normal. Baby had a strong heartbeat at my 16 week appointment. \n\nMy husband\u2019s brother and his wife (who we are very close to) also happens to be expecting and her due date is a month behind what mine would\u2019ve been. We scheduled back to back appointments with them at a local ultrasound studio to find out the sex of our babies at the same time. \n\nThis appointment was where we learned that out baby was not moving and had no heartbeat at 19 weeks. This was a total shock because I had had no symptoms indicating that anything was wrong. My husband, daughter, mother sister, brother and sister-in-law and two nieces (3.5 and 5) were all there with us. Part of me hated that our families found out like that but I was also relieved that we didn\u2019t have to call them out of the blue to deliver the bad news. \n\nAfter getting to the hospital and getting checked in to a room on the labor and delivery floor, the doctor did an ultrasound to confirm and noted that he saw some swelling around the baby\u2019s head. He then told us I would be induced with Cytotec (misoprostol), given vaginally every 6 hours. They said I would probably be there for a day or two. After just two doses, our baby was born at 6:15am on February 4, 2018, less than 9 hours after the process was started. It was then that we learned that we had a son. The OB noticed that the umbilical cord was a bit thinner than normal where it connected to the baby. Thankfully, I didn\u2019t have to push at all because the thought of doing so was quite scary to me for some reason, especially since I\u2019d had a c-section with my daughter and had no idea what to expect. I don\u2019t remember much else that happened during the delivery or for several hours afterwards since I was still groggy from Ambien (sleeping medicine) and Stadol (pain medicine). I was given both of these medications when I\u2019m sure everyone thought the delivery was a long way off still. Part of me regrets that I don\u2019t remember more since that was the only memories I\u2019ll ever have with my son but part of thinks perhaps it was a blessing as it was by far the most difficult experience I\u2019ve ever had. \n\nWe didn\u2019t get any answers as to what exactly happened. We weren\u2019t offered to have testing done in the hospital and by the time we realized it, it was too late. My doctor proactively ordered lab work to test me for clotting disorders. The results should be in next week. \n\nTomorrow will be three weeks and I feel like I\u2019ve been on a rollercoaster emotionally. The next several months will be hard with my due date approaching and the addition of a new niece to our family who will always be the same age that my son should be. On top of that, a close friend of mine is pregnant with twins. My husband and I want to try again right away and got the ok from my doctor after my first period. I\u2019m scared that it will take a long time to conceive again and I know another pregnancy will be so difficult after this but I\u2019m fighting to remain hopeful.

I know quite a few people who've had trouble getting pregnant.  And I qualify as AMA--with all the associated risks.   When my husband and I started TTC, we took everything month by month, and took nothing for granted. \n\nShortly after I learned I was pregnant, my sister announced that she was pregnant with her second.   She was about 7 weeks along, I was 6.  And her news made me feel worried--it was so early, and our EDDs were so close, that if anything were to happen to either of us, it would just be really hard\u2026.  I didn't want to share our news at that point.\n\nWe had the first ultrasound to confirm the pregnancy/heartbeat, the NIPT, the NT scan, the quad screen.   All OK.  Still, I wanted to wait to share our news.  At the anatomical US at 19 weeks, everything looked healthy. I knew there were still milestones to get through, but I felt hopeful for the first time, like I could start enjoying my pregnancy a little.  We started sharing the news that we were expecting.\n\nThe next week, we learned that the baby had one, possibly two congenital heart defects (CHDs).  This was completely unexpected.  Still, we were comforted by the fact that the issues were common, and treatment was straightforward, with no lasting harm to the baby.  \n\nFrom there on out, worse news rolled in every few days.   The baby didn't have other symptoms, but the cardiologist wanted to rule out a specific microdeletion syndrome as the cause of the CHDs, so we went for an amnio.  In the meantime, a third CHD was discovered.  The baby would need a more serious and very rare type of operation, right at birth--one that not all infants survive, and which sometimes results in some neurological damage/developmental delays.  Obviously, this wasn't the situation we wanted for our baby, but it still seemed to us like chances for a good outcome/good quality of life were too good to not give the baby its chance.  \n\nThen we got the amnio results.  The suspected microdeletion syndrome was ruled out.  Instead, the baby had a different, much rarer microdeletion syndrome.  It affects roughly 1 in a million to 1 in 3 million births.  The syndrome generally can't be identified in an ultrasound---essentially, everything looks okay on the US, but many things aren't functioning properly.  It was a completely unexpected, blind-siding diagnosis.  [And I'm sorry if that's hard to hear about for those of you who might already be anxious about the future.]\n\nOur baby turned out to have a particularly severe form of this microdeletion. It's extremely rare, and babies often do not survive the first 9 months.  There were at least 5 or 6 foreseeable ways the baby could die before or after birth.   Whichever way things developed, the baby would have to undergo multiple surgeries if it was born alive\u2026.  If the baby survived those, no one could say what quality of life our child would have.    Future surgeries were definite.  Blindness, deafness, never learning to speak, walk, or control their bladder/bowel movements, predisposition to two types of cancer in childhood and beyond\u2026.all of these things were possibilities.    And that was without considering complications from the heart surgery/other things that could go wrong.      \n\nWe felt like we couldn't risk putting the baby through so much potential suffering with such poor a prognosis for quality of life.  Faced with so many different, and painful ways the baby could die, we felt like the best thing we could do was protect our baby from that suffering.  We decided to have an induction.  We had 36 hrs to make arrangements and spend some last time with the baby, and then we had to go to L&amp;D.  Our baby passed away in peace, warm and safe in mama's belly, surrounded by the sounds of mama's heartbeat, and maybe mom and dad's voices.  I delivered him the next day.  \n\nI had wanted the sex of the baby to be a surprise, so we only learned when the baby was born that it was a little boy.  He was amazing.  So tiny and perfect, you wouldn't know to look at him that he was so sick.  \n\nOur family is sad for us...no one's second guessed our decision.   They have good intentions, but have kind of botched attempts to be supportive.  Our visit home for Christmas was particularly bad, and since then, I've mostly stopped talking to them about how I'm doing.  Friends have been a little better.  \n\nInitially after the loss, I oscillated between wanting to be pregnant again as soon as possible, and being afraid of future pregnancies.  Testing indicates that we are probably not carriers for this microdeletion.  My OB said we could start TTC in the new year.  \n\nSo we started in January.   In one way, it was a relief.  Being of AMA, I didn't want to wait too long.  But on the other hand, I still have all the risks of (now even older) AMA, along with some not easy decisions about other tests/scans, related to our son's diagnosis, if/when it gets to that point.   Not to mention all the other diagnoses one learns about when seeking support from others who've experienced TMFR/perinatal loss.  This is going to be a long road.  \n\nI decided to join this sub, because this past month, I feel like I've kind of plateaued in feeling better.  Or even been back-sliding.  Getting my period the first cycle we TCC was sad.   On balance, the thought of being able to TTC again helped keep me going in those first couple months, and now that wind has kind of been taken out of the sails.  Plus, my sister's daughter is going to be born in two weeks\u2026.and the week after, our son...will not.   Even though I've been to a bereavement counselor a few times, and my husband and I have connected with a parent support group for perinatal loss, one of the most helpful things for me has been reading threads of people who've gone through this.\n\nSo here I am.

We saw a heartbeat. We saw the baby moving their arms and legs. We got an ultrasound photo and we were in heaven. \n\nAs my midwife practice doesn\u2019t do \u201cofficial\u201d ultrasounds, we were referred to a regular OB to do a dating scan. At 9+2, we found out the baby had stopped growing at 7+4. I had no cramping, no signs to indicate anything was wrong. Looking back, I had noticed that I wasn\u2019t as tired and my boobs weren\u2019t as sore. I brushed it off as getting closer to the second trimester. \n\nAt what should have been 10 weeks, I went in for a D&amp;E as I still wasn\u2019t having any symptoms. I couldn\u2019t imagine waiting in anticipation for my body to register that the baby was no longer alive. The procedure was quick and done under general anesthesia which I was thankful for. My recovery has been ok for the most part. At just over a week out, I only have cramps or bleeding if I am particularly active. \n\nMy OB said we could start trying again after 1-2 cycles. Emotionally, I know I need time to recover. But the rational part of my brain would like to prepare for when we can try.

I told my best friend that I was pregnant and she was so happy for me, she and her husband started trying.  We always talked about being pregnant at the same time and this was our chance!  But it didn't work out that way. \n\nA few weeks after I miscarried, she told me she was pregnant. Now, her little bean was very wiggly during her ultrasound and they found out she's having a boy.  I am so happy for her, but I can't help but be incredibly sad for me and my husband. I haven't told anyone this because it makes me feel horrible and small. \n\nI love my best friend, her husband and the little girl they already have and I know I'm going to love this new little boy, but hearing from her and talking about her pregnancy just makes me feel like a sad failure. She loves me so much and cried when she told me because she felt bad and, oh my God, that just tore me apart, because I am so happy for her and I want to be there for her, but it's so hard. \n\nAm I selfish? Should I be over it all by now? I just don't know.\n\nHas anyone else been in this situation?

We started trying to conceive again about six months later. But haven't been able to get pregnant since. \n\nWe were in denial for sure for a while. But when I turned 30 we decided we couldn't be in denial anymore. So we saw a specialist, ran a bunch of tests. Found out we have issues on both sides. More on mine than his though. We decided to do Ivf. We had a good retrieval and after wards I got surgery for endometriosis. \n\nWe finally did an embryo transfer last month. And I started getting positives! And they would get darker and darker. We got a positive beta on Valentine's day. The baby would've been due five days from our wedding anniversary. It was a boy. We affectionately called him Elmer, so he would stick. It felt meant to be. But our joy was short lived. The betas wouldn't double. Then they slowed down a lot. And last week I found out I was gonna miscarry. Stopped my meds and two days ago I miscarried the sac. It was extremely traumatic for me...I didn't expect to see it as I hadn't last time. And now I am just...in hell. I feel so worthless. And so empty. And I'm so sad that I have to suffer through another empty mother's day. I also have to wait to try again till summer as I'll need another surgery which just makes it all worse...\n\nAnyway I'm sorry for the wall of text and thank you for reading.", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "ttcafterloss", "subreddit_id": "t5_34scd", "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "I wanted to introduce myself.

Discovered somewhat diminished ovarian reserve a year ago while getting tests done for embryo banking (only made 2, no PGS). Got a little more serious in December and visited an RE. First medicated cycle was Clomid/TI, second was Letrozole/Ovidrel/IUI.\n\nThe IUI resulted in a pregnancy with an October EDD. This was a bit unexpected, since I had never gotten a positive and thought it would take much longer. I had just quit a terrible job and was looking forward to some time off, and started to panic a bit about looking for my next job so I could get maternity benefits.\n\nThe pregnancy itself looked promising for a few weeks, albeit with some lower than average betas and minor spotting. And then suddenly, I had some heavy spotting and my betas took a nosedive during week 6-7, a few days before my scheduled ultrasound.\n\nI am unusually pragmatic (to the point where some may consider me cold), so I wasn't terribly upset over the news of the miscarriage (nothing I could have done, etc, etc). Yes, I was sad that it didn't work out, but I am incredibly hopeful for future attempts. I was more frustrated that I'd spent so much time obsessing over mc statistics during the last few weeks (which, in retrospect, had no impact on the outcome), and now I have to spend more time waiting until my body is ready to try again (at 35, I don't feel like I have all the time in the world). On a less serious note, there was also a family wedding/trip in August that I was hoping to avoid attending with my pregnancy as an excuse.\n\nI love that there is such a supportive community on Reddit. I've read posts by women (and men) who are going through fertility journeys that are much more difficult (and longer) than mine, and these stories are not only inspirational, they help me maintain perspective. My heart goes out to everyone on this sub; it's a shitty situation, and I wish everyone the best of luck. \n\nThanks for reading!", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "ttcafterloss", "subreddit_id": "t5_34scd", "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Intro from a noob", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/ttcafterloss/comments/8337bs/intro_from_a_noob/"}, {"author": "AutoModerator", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "brand_safe": false, "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1520579562, "distinguished": "moderator", "domain": "self.ttcafterloss", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/ttcafterloss/comments/834v3x/ttcafterloss_ttc_daily_discussion_thread_march_09/", "gilded": 0, "id": "834v3x", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_css_class": "ttc", "link_flair_richtext": [{"e": "text", "t": "TTC Thread"}], "link_flair_text": "TTC Thread", "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "richtext", "locked": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 56, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/ttcafterloss/comments/834v3x/ttcafterloss_ttc_daily_discussion_thread_march_09/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1520632716, "rte_mode": "markdown", "score": 3, "selftext": "**This thread is for members who are TTC or waiting to try.

This sounds so scary to me but I\u2019m more scared not to try or god forbid to have another one and need to repeat this process again.\n\nI\u2019m looking for any advice on how to fully heal the body to try again. I\u2019m going to stay on prenatals, continue not smoking, no more than 1-2 glasses of wine a week and keep my generally healthy diet in check. Planning for my rainbow baby has been the only thing that will keep a smile on my face right now so I know it\u2019s really soon, but I want to feel like I\u2019m attempting to work towards something. I\u2019ve never felt so empty in my life.", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "ttcafterloss", "subreddit_id": "t5_34scd", "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Missed miscarriage at 11.5 weeks due to a possible trisomy 18 diagnosis", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/ttcafterloss/comments/836vxu/missed_miscarriage_at_115_weeks_due_to_a_possible/"}, {"author": "paperducky", "author_flair_background_color": "", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [{"e": "text", "t": "28, WTT, MC 1/22/18"}], "author_flair_text": "28, WTT, MC 1/22/18", "author_flair_text_color": "dark", "author_flair_type": "richtext", "brand_safe": false, "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1520622254, "domain": "self.ttcafterloss", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/ttcafterloss/comments/839766/beta_hell_what_next/", "gilded": 0, "id": "839766", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "no_follow": false, "num_comments": 6, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/ttcafterloss/comments/839766/beta_hell_what_next/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1520683106, "rte_mode": "markdown", "score": 7, "selftext": "To preface this post, I do mention positive HPT results, but I'm sure I'm not pregnant and I'm just wondering if anyone else has been through this. I had a D&amp;C six weeks ago. My baby's heart stopped beating at 8+5 and I had the D&amp;C 3 days after they found there was no heartbeat. My doctor told me to wait 3 weeks before sex and 3 cycles before I start trying to get pregnant again. We waited 3 weeks before having sex again and for the most part I haven't had much sex and what I've had, I've used protection with my partner. We did one stupid thing where we went for round 2 and didn't put on a condom right away, but that's still considered unprotected sex. \n\nAlmost 2 weeks ago I took a FRER to calm my mind and reassure myself I wasn't pregnant, that my period was coming. It was positive. I called my doctor and they scheduled me to have blood work done to see if this was a viable pregnancy or HCG that was still dropping after the D&amp;C. I wasn't able to go in for my first blood work appointment until Wednesday because the day I got the positive pregnancy test I had to leave town for business. I kept testing, and all other tests that aren't First Response have been negative. Wednesday's blood results showed HCG at 5, Progesterone at 12.6. I know there was only one day I could have conceived, and those numbers aren't right for someone who would be 5 weeks pregnant. I also have no symptoms whatsoever. I don't know what happens next, even if this is slow dropping HCG. I just wanna be able to start trying again if I want to...", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "ttcafterloss", "subreddit_id": "t5_34scd", "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Beta hell - What next?", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/ttcafterloss/comments/839766/beta_hell_what_next/"}, {"author": "walkalong123", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "brand_safe": false, "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1520637577, "domain": "self.ttcafterloss", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/ttcafterloss/comments/83b46r/recurrent_pregnancy_loss_tw_pregnancy_possible/", "gilded": 0, "id": "83b46r", "is_crosspostable": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 2, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/ttcafterloss/comments/83b46r/recurrent_pregnancy_loss_tw_pregnancy_possible/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1520704006, "rte_mode": "markdown", "score": 0, "selftext": "[removed]", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "ttcafterloss", "subreddit_id": "t5_34scd", "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "default", "title": "Recurrent pregnancy loss (TW: pregnancy, possible loss)", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/ttcafterloss/comments/83b46r/recurrent_pregnancy_loss_tw_pregnancy_possible/"}, {"author": "Nic_14", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "brand_safe": false, "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1520646442, "domain": "i.redd.it", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/ttcafterloss/comments/83c25e/need_help_reading_opks/", "gilded": 0, "id": "83c25e", "is_crosspostable": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": true, "is_self": false, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_css_class": "ttc", "link_flair_richtext": [{"e": "text", "t": "TTC Thread"}], "link_flair_template_id": "7b46ee92-a6ad-11e4-8cec-22000bb24123", "link_flair_text": "TTC Thread", "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "richtext", "locked": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 1, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/ttcafterloss/comments/83c25e/need_help_reading_opks/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1520712473, "rte_mode": "markdown", "score": 1, "selftext": "", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "ttcafterloss", "subreddit_id": "t5_34scd", "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "default", "thumbnail_height": 140, "thumbnail_width": 140, "title": "Need help reading OPKs!", "url": "https://i.redd.it/hkmuatp2duk01.jpg"}, {"author": "whoawookie", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "brand_safe": false, "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1520650148, "domain": "self.ttcafterloss", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/ttcafterloss/comments/83ceuo/mc_at_7_weeks_after_cp/", "gilded": 0, "id": "83ceuo", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "no_follow": false, "num_comments": 10, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/ttcafterloss/comments/83ceuo/mc_at_7_weeks_after_cp/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1520715688, "rte_mode": "markdown", "score": 12, "selftext": "I\u2019m devastated, numb, and just feel so helpless.

I had a dating ultrasound at 6 weeks 3 days and we heard baby\u2019s heartbeat. It was a beautiful moment and I felt so secure. There was a heartbeat! What could go wrong? But two days ago I started spotting which worried me but I was still hopeful. It\u2019s probably a SCH I thought. Then yesterday I passed a large clot and my heart sank. I went in for an ultrasound and there was no heartbeat. Is it just bad luck that I had a CP and a MC one after another? I\u2019m only 30 and otherwise healthy. I have this horrible fear that I won\u2019t be able to carry a baby to term. I think about my young naive self wanting 3 or 4 children and now I would be so lucky to have just 1. I\u2019m just so mentally and physically exhausted from being pregnant and then not pregnant. I feel so empty now.
