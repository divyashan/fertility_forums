I used to spend a lot of time on an app-based ttc board, but you have to enter due dates to view the posts from the app, and entering new hopeful due dates each month is just the pits. Alas, I stumbled upon this board and have been so comforted by your kindness and encouragement of one another. This is a world I never imagined I'd be a part of, but how grateful I am to be surrounded by such beautiful souls. My sincerest love, empathy, and hope go out to each of you. XOXO!\n\n**Buckle up this is majorly long, but so therapeutic in writing &lt;3 No worries if you TL;DR!**\n\nHere's a bit of my story. Back in 8/15, I forgot to pick up my BC pills, and stumbled into a surprise pregnancy. I was all \"ooh look at me and my super fertile woman powers\"--yeah THAT girl. I read everything I could find on pregnancy, birth, babies, etc., with one exception: the second I read the word miscarriage, I skipped the paragraph. No way that would apply to me. NEXT\n\nOn the evening of Oct 1, I looked down to see the bright red blood. Over the next 10 hours, I miscarried naturally at 8 weeks. I was devastated.\n\nThis pregnancy convinced us that we were indeed ready to start a family. After waiting three months, we tried for 6 months. The due date came and went, and marked CD 1 of a cycle where we once again found ourselves pregnant. Oh. What. Joy. We told our closest friends and I told my boss. I had just been promoted and was working under a new supervisor. The summer months were our craziest, so I needed her to know I would be out for Drs. appts. Plus, she was a bit of a sour puss and I hoped that by telling her my story, she might empathize a bit and wouldn't hold it against me if I needed to be out for an afternoon. \n\nI must say, I kind of gave this pregnancy the stiff arm. I didn't want to get too attached. I was still super hopeful, but I had so many walls up when it came to just loving this baby. I didn't want to hurt again.\n\nI had an appt at 6w+5, where baby was only measuring at 4w+6. My Dr. said I probably just ovulated late, but I knew my dates and knew it wasn't progressing. I began spotting at 7w. Within 2 days, the bleeding and cramping intensified. I told my boss that I was actively miscarrying and may need to leave work. This was THE busiest day of the year: the last in a string of five 14 hr work days. She was scheduled to leave for vacation that afternoon, and essentially told me I needed to stay, and she couldn't believe how selfish people could be with there time off...I mean...she had been planning her trip for MONTHS (ugh). Being young, eager to please, and oblivious to my rights, I stayed, and hid the emotional and physical pain best I could. \n\nI walked in the door that night at 9pm, and completed the miscarriage by 10pm. I crawled right back in bed and went to sleep. I don't even think I cried.\n\n\nFor the sake of length, here's a summary of what's happened since then:\n-My stiff-armed pregnancy left me in a void I couldn't even recognize. I slowly crumbled. I harbored intense resentment for my job, supervisor, and my body. As I let myself get mad, I also let myself get sad. I quit that job 3 months later. It was terrifying, but has proven to be the absolute best decision.\n-My OB did a fertility work up 3 months later. All has come back \"normal,\" which puts me firmly in the \"Unexplained\" category. He did put me on low-dose aspirin \n-I've been working from home the last 6 months. Those first two months I just let myself be really really sad. Since then, I've balanced healthy work with a healthy lifestyle. I've lost 10lbs, started exercising again, joined a church, and revitalized my marriage. I think I was borderline PCOS (although my Dr never said so) but essentially all of my related symptoms have subsided since modifying my diet. \n-We are coming up on a year since our last conception, and we are 20 months into this journey all together. That sucks. I recognize it may only be a fraction of your journey--sending you love my sister. \n\n\nThere have been invaluable lessons in these losses and in this waiting. I am a different woman. When I think of the mother I will one day be, I am proud of her. She will be so strong, and her babies will be so precious.\n\nBut the truth is, a part of me envies the girl I was 20 months ago. Of course my MCs robbed me of two babies, but they also robbed me of that innocence and optimism and JOY. By the time my second pregnancy came around, those were gone, and the walls were up. \n\nSo my vow is to let that girl be a part of me once again. No more stiff-arming from me. The second I see those two lines, I'm going to jump up and down (gently of course...haha...let's not get crazy) and cry tears of PURE JOY. I am going to fall. in. love. with that baby, I'm going to think to myself \"look at me and my super fertile woman powers.\" After all, those walls are only meant to protect me, and that baby will deserve more. I am filled to the brim with hope. \n\n\nIf you've made it this far, you're pretty super. I recognize that all of our stories are so very different, with those common threads that bind us. Maybe some of this sounds familiar, or maybe you've taken a totally different road when it comes to coping, healing, and celebrating. Either way, my heart goes out to you and I can't wait to learn from you and heal with you. Much love, sisters!\n\n\n\n", "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "ttcafterloss", "subreddit_id": "t5_34scd", "suggested_sort": null, "thumbnail": "self", "title": "(TW: MC) Intro: What are gals like us doing in a forum like this", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/ttcafterloss/comments/656yzq/tw_mc_intro_what_are_gals_like_us_doing_in_a/"}, {"author": "RealityTVSuperFan", "author_created_utc": 1487698566, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_text": null, "author_fullname": "t2_15m3eu", "brand_safe": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1492123763, "domain": "instagram.com", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/ttcafterloss/comments/658wh4/nancy_kerrigan_speaks_about_having_6_miscarriages/", "gilded": 0, "id": "658wh4", "is_self": false, "link_flair_css_class": "offtopic", "link_flair_text": "Off Topic", "locked": false, "media": {"oembed": {"author_name": "dwtsfntsy", "author_url": "https://www.instagram.com/dwtsfntsy", "description": "60 Likes, 2 Comments - DWTSFantasy (@dwtsfntsy) on Instagram: \"@Nancyakerrigan's story that every mother should hear.

This is light, barely a pad worth in 12 hours (I have changed it several times regardless, in case that sounds gross!) but it is a mix of red, pink and brown bleeding. Some clots now later in the day. Perhaps it's just coming on slowly. The light bleed makes me think there's a chance it's just a bleed, not a loss, but maybe it varies. \n\nYesterday I got a blood test at my GP but that won't be in til Tues and I fear it won't tell me much without a second test for rising hcg- if the FRER was a positive the bloods will be. Perhaps the level will tell me something. I hold very little hope.

I just had my 3rd chemical pregnancy last weekend. We have been trying for over a year and right before my 3rd loss, I had blood work done.

My ob/gyn didn't even think I would ovulate that cycle but I did, just late, and my pregnancy was confirmed via HPTs and multiple blood tests. Because of the low progesterone result, I had my levels checked again and it was 11.7 at 4 weeks pregnant - my dr was not concerned and happy that it went up, but from what i've read, that's still a low number. Anyways, a couple of days later, my progesterone dramatically dropped to 2.9 and I lost the baby 2 days later (last weekend). My ob/gyn has now prescribed me Endometrin in suppository form to use this current cycle. Does anyone have experience with this progesterone suppository? I cant find much personal use on the internet. Is if considered \"bio-identical\"? From what i'm researching, most prescriptions are synthetic progestins and come with a slew of side effects and increased risk of blod clots, cancer...etc. So Im really hoping to find a prescription strength progesterone suppository that is specifically bio-identical.\n\nI've read many women successfully used Prometrium but it contains peanut oil so i can not use that.

My name is Maggie, and I lost my son in February when I was thirty-five weeks along. I didn't have as long of a wait for my first pregnancy as some, but I had been actively trying for a baby and was EXTREMELY excited for my baby boy. When I was about 12 weeks along, my BIL jokingly called my baby \"lil' Raffael\". It had made us laugh, and it soon became a running joke to call the bump Raffael at every turn. I, always a fan of the spontaneous and fun twists of life, of course fell in love with the name, as did my husband. It was not too out there, and it just felt so right. I already felt I was having a boy, but now I wanted it to be true even more.\n\n(TW: happy ultrasound/doctor visits, and lots of gross happy moments lol) We got every ultrasound we could. At 14 weeks, my doctor was ready to place a bet that we would have a boy. Then, at 17 weeks he thought he may have seen girl parts. At 21 weeks, we got an anatomy scan. Still no luck. We laughed it off. We would love our Raffael even if he was a girl. Lol. (Of course, the name would have to change. :P) At 32 weeks, we finally saw the boy bits. Our ultrasound tech was a little hesitant to say for sure, but I was convinced. I immediately bought a blue cake and invited my family over for a simple gender reveal. I had a lot of fun and smiled so much my cheeks hurt. You should see the picture we posted to Facebook. Back then, it was annoyingly happy. Today, it's absolutely heartbreaking. Funny how that changed so suddenly.\n\nSoon after, I was 35 weeks pregnant, and I couldn't feel Raff's rambunctious kicks anymore. I immediately remembered all the things I had read about babies kicking less because they had less room. It comforted me a little, but this was not the energetic boy I had gotten to know. We went to the hospital. I was not my usual self because I was worried. My husband tried all sorts of jokes, and I could only manage weak smiles. I'm glad he tried, though. It made me think maybe this wasn't as serious as I thought.\n\nIt was even more serious than I thought.\n\nMy doctor was away on vacation, so the nurses searched for a heartbeat with the doppler. The searching was so much quieter than what I was used to. For the first time, I wondered not if Raff was okay but if he was even still with me. I remember looking at my husband in a bit of a panic. The nurse noticed and shook her head fiercely. \"No,\" she said pointedly, already knowing where my thoughts were. \"Don't go there. The baby might be in a weird position. Let me order you an ultrasound.\"\n\nI'm glad she said it, because I would have driven myself insane with tears if she hadn't. But it only delayed the inevitable. After probably another hour and a half, we got our ultrasound. The room was dead silent, with about five more people than usual. Of course something was wrong, there was no denying it. But I needed to hear it. My husband and I gave each other comforting smiles as they finally got a doctor in the room. He looked at the ultrasound for an eternity.\n\nAnd then he said the words that broke my heart into a million pieces. \"Your baby's heart isn't beating.\" He said it with compassion, and I could tell it hurt him a lot to say it. I later found out he and his wife had gone through the same thing. He was a good doctor for the situation, but he had a hard time looking at me whenever we spoke. Anyway, we went through the whole ordeal of labor and giving birth, and I finally got to see the little person I had spent so long germinating. It was awful. It was wonderful. It sucked that the most beautiful person I had ever seen was dead. Those words may not be elegant, but they're true.\n\nAnyway, here I am. I'm glad to have you, if you'll have me. I hate that we're here, but I'm so glad I'm not the only one to have gone through this. I've also just started a blog.

My body didn't take to being off birth control very well, and it took 4 months and a round of Provera to get with the program.  I couldn't believe that my cycles really seemed to kick into gear after that - and I was seemingly regular for 3 cycles.  At the end of the 3rd, we got our BFP, and were absolutely over the moon. We found out shortly after getting home from an awesome vacation, where I did *everything* a pregnant person shouldn't... roller coasters, all the alcohol my heart desired, sushi, hot tubs, the whole nine yards. It felt so perfect that our little baby waited until after we'd gone, because when we started planning that vacation (in August) wed somehow deluded ourselves into believing there was no way we wouldn't be pregnant by then, and I wouldn't be able to do any of those things (ha. haha. ha.)\n\nWe spent 3 weeks day dreaming about nurseries and announcements and calling our little blob by cute nicknames...we told people (dammit, why did we tell people).  Then my OB called to let me know that my latest beta wasn't good, and I was going to lose it. That was 4 days ago...so we spent 4 days in pregnant limbo - pregnant with a baby that would never exist to anyone but us, and waiting for that baby to die.\n\nNow that I've finally started spotting and feeling generally AF-y, I'm relieved that there is an end in sight and that we can get back on the horse soon... but it still hurts so bad.  The dreams of our December baby are over. The tiny Red Converse I bought for our announcement and the afghan I started crocheting no longer have an owner.  I know it was early... today would be 6w+2, and statistically it's not at all uncommon but... this was never supposed to be part of our story. Before now miscarriage felt like something that only happens to *other* people, it would never happen to *us*.

Since then I have not been very active in posting or commenting on reddit as I typically keep busy to clear my mind. Also, I think it's important to note I'm the husband posting.\n\nFlash forward to now and I'm concerned. My wife and I prior to losing Austin have been trying to conceive since January of 2016. We had a chemical in early February, a 6-week miscarriage in March and then Austin was born still in November. After doing every test we could, doctors said we'd have a 90% chance of finding out something, well, we found nothing. We are in that 10% chance of never knowing why we lost him. \n\nWe decided to start trying again as soon as we could after testing, which was this past March 2017. It's been now two cycles, and both times now we have not been able to conceive. For many this is not new, but for us it is, and it is upsetting. We went from always conceiving but losing to not conceiving at all. \n\nMy and my wife's theory personally is my wife's thyroid issue. For backstory; a month after my wife and I got married, she was diagnosed with Thyroid Cancer. A couple of months later, we were lucky enough for her to have surgery and she received a Total Thyroidectomy. 6 months after was when we decided to start trying as the doctors told us it was safe. And here we are. \n\nBlaming the Thyroid as our main issue since we could not find any other reasons, and her levels were definitely different compared to other online thyroid friends who were pregnant and successful, in February of 2017, my wife talked to her doctor and he switched from her generic Levothyroxine to Synthroid. She didn't like it and switched back in March 2017 (last month).  I personally think this switching might be some of the cause, if not the cause of our issue right now since the hormones are a HUGE part of pregnancy, and I'm trying to convince my wife to be patient, but I also am not her and don't want to overstep since I'm not a doctor.\n\nOur other concern though is that during the pregnancy of Austin, her thyroid levels were not documented well enough by her endo. She supposedly has the best endo doctor in the area, but it does seem the thyroid is all he cares about. Not thyroid and how it comes to play when pregnancy is involved.\n\nI'm curious if anyone here as ever gone through what we have or something similar and is willing to talk with me and I can be more specific about where we are so I can get some recommendations. We really want to have a baby and if every test comes back saying that we should have no problem having one, it's really frustrating that we are having these issues right now.\n\nCan anyone provide us with some insight?\n", "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "ttcafterloss", "subreddit_id": "t5_34scd", "suggested_sort": null, "thumbnail": "self", "title": "TTC After Loss and Questions relating to No Thyroid (Specifics in Text)", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/ttcafterloss/comments/65w2v1/ttc_after_loss_and_questions_relating_to_no/"}, {"author": "vivifyallthethings", "author_created_utc": 1390764426, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_text": null, "author_fullname": "t2_ezmob", "brand_safe": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1492460958, "domain": "self.ttcafterloss", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/ttcafterloss/comments/65y4vi/healing_from_miscarriage_and_issues_with_soon_to/", "gilded": 0, "id": "65y4vi", "is_self": true, "locked": false, "media_embed": {}, "num_comments": 5, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/ttcafterloss/comments/65y4vi/healing_from_miscarriage_and_issues_with_soon_to/", "retrieved_on": 1494606076, "score": 10, "secure_media_embed": {}, "selftext": "As of today, I'm six and a half weeks post miscarriage and almost physically ready to try again. I had a complete miscarriage naturally after a few days of bleeding where I just knew it was over. I was just under six weeks pregnant and I know my PCOS makes miscarriage more likely. I believe that if I had experienced this miscarriage in a vacuum, I would likely be mentally and emotionally ready to try again as soon as possible. But as it is, I'm... struggling with the thought of bringing a grandchild into this world for my in-laws.  \n\nMy brother in law and sister in law are going through a divorce that started within days of conceiving. The divorce is extremely ugly and the family will be much better off without her toxicity. However, I\u2019m concerned that if my husband and I were to get pregnant right away again that everyone would always look at our child and think of this other child that we\u2019ll probably never see. She says she\u2019s currently 8 weeks and I\u2019m probably ovulating next weekend, so *if* I got pregnant this cycle, the children would be very close in age.  \n\nFurther, we aren\u2019t even sure that she\u2019s pregnant. She says she had a vanishing twin miscarriage at 4.5 weeks, but that there is still a viable pregnancy with a sac (u/s at 5 weeks). My sister in law won\u2019t let my brother in law call the doctor to confirm the pregnancy. I\u2019m upset that she could be insensitive enough to lie about a vanishing twin miscarriage/ pregnancy. We suspect that she\u2019ll lie about a subsequent miscarriage.  \n\nThroughout all of this, I know that this is my brother in law\u2019s hardship. I\u2019m trying to focus on him and support him through this, but I can\u2019t help but be a little selfish trying to protect my future children against this toxicity. I know that my in-laws, who are so kind and caring, will always remember this other child if it\u2019s really there, but if I could lessen that sting by putting some more time between the births, is that something that I should do? Has anyone else gone through something similar?  \n\nI don\u2019t want my child to be a source of pain for others. That\u2019s a hard start and the exact opposite of what a child should be.  I know many think I should forget her and live my life without her influence, but she will influence it just the same through others because the pregnancies/children will be so close.\n\n\n\n\nTl;dr - I miscarried around the same time that my soon to be ex sister in law conceived. Can\u2019t be sure if she\u2019s being truthful about the pregnancy or a vat of toxic waste that doesn\u2019t want to get a divorce.  \n\n\n*****\nThere is some history that I originally wrote out to be included as part of the main post, but the post became too long and it wasn\u2019t 100% relevant to my question. If you\u2019d like some additional background, it\u2019s below.  \n*****\n\n**Background on Brother and Sister in Law:**  \n\nThis past weekend I learned that my sister in law may be eight weeks pregnant. And while this would normally be a fantastic coincidence (despite my miscarriage), this sister in law has always been difficult. As my husband\u2019s brother\u2019s wife, she has never warmed up to me for reasons that are beyond me. And while this has been a source of disquiet within me to be slighted by her in my attempts to get to know her, I thought that it would resolve itself eventually or she would be divorced out of the family. (Before you think that it was something that I did to her, I can assure you I did nothing but mind my own business. This is a woman that stays on her phone throughout a family dinner, not engaging in conversation, ignoring everyone around her.)  \n\nTheir divorce was imminent and it was just a question of when. And unfortunately it has turned ugly; extremely ugly. I\u2019ll forego the details that don\u2019t relate to this story, but what you need to know is that she\u2019s emotionally abusive towards my brother in law while trying to manipulate him to stay with her. She\u2019s also stated to several people that she\u2019s going to drag this out as long as possible. My brother in law uses his phone to record every moment that he is in their house so that there is indisputable proof against \u201che said\u201d/\u201dshe said\u201d. On it\u2019s own without the alleged pregnancy, their divorce is heartbreaking. There is so much unnecessary pain.  \n\nIt appears that my brother and sister in law conceived two days before agreeing to move forward with a divorce. My brother in law says that they used a condom because things were rocky, but his wife has since told him that she \u201ctampered\u201d with the condom (she tried to backtrack that statement later). To complicate matters even further, she didn\u2019t tell him until she was five weeks pregnant and suffered a vanishing twin miscarriage. And the way that she told him was over text and part of a backhanded comment regarding fatherhood. I don\u2019t remember the exact text, but it was something along the lines of \u201cwell, you were a father for four and a half weeks\u201d.  \n\nShe claims that she started bleeding so she hopped into the shower, but she didn\u2019t call her doctor (supposedly because she\u2019s an EMT and knew what was happening). A few days later, she went to a clinic in another state while visiting her mom where they did an ultrasound confirming a viable pregnancy. They told her that the bleeding was probably vanishing twin because they could still see a sac (she was five weeks at this point).  \n\nThere are many things that don\u2019t add up, but we can\u2019t NOT believe her until it is confirmed independently by a doctor.  \n* First, there is the hopping in the shower. I understand that every woman and every pregnancy is different, but when I had my miscarriage there was no way I was hopping in the shower. I was curled up in front of the toilet going between dry heaving and going number two for about 45 minutes before I passed the tissue. It\u2019s hard for me to imagine that someone could take a shower through that.  \n* Second, my brother in law didn\u2019t know if she\u2019s had a serial hcg test, but it didn\u2019t sound like that\u2019s been done. She has her annual gyno appointment in a few weeks that\u2019s been scheduled since before she got \u201cpregnant\u201d, but wouldn\u2019t her doctor want to confirm the pregnancy is viable with serial hcg test especially if there was bleeding to rule out a missed miscarriage?  \n* Third, she won\u2019t let my brother in law come to any of the appointments or even talk to the doctor to confirm the pregnancy because it \u201cstresses her out\u201d and she doesn\u2019t want to miscarry the remaining fetus.  \n* Fourth, if you calculate her pregnancy from the date they conceived she\u2019s a week behind. She\u2019s saying she\u2019s eight weeks, but the date they conceived would make her nine weeks.", "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "ttcafterloss", "subreddit_id": "t5_34scd", "suggested_sort": null, "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Healing from Miscarriage and Issues with Soon to be Ex Sister in Law", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/ttcafterloss/comments/65y4vi/healing_from_miscarriage_and_issues_with_soon_to/"}, {"author": "AutoModerator", "author_created_utc": 1325741068, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_text": null, "author_fullname": "t2_6l4z3", "brand_safe": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1492499079, "distinguished": "moderator", "domain": "self.ttcafterloss", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/ttcafterloss/comments/661bja/ttcafterloss_ttc_daily_discussion_thread_april_18/", "gilded": 0, "id": "661bja", "is_self": true, "link_flair_css_class": "ttc", "link_flair_text": "TTC Thread", "locked": false, "media_embed": {}, "num_comments": 25, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/ttcafterloss/comments/661bja/ttcafterloss_ttc_daily_discussion_thread_april_18/", "retrieved_on": 1494607647, "score": 5, "secure_media_embed": {}, "selftext": "**This thread is for members who are TTC or waiting to try.

Fairly light, brownish blood... which lasted four days. Great... we can start trying again as soon as it's done. My ovulation app was saying the 19th was ovulation day so we're we're aiming for that. \n\nHowever the week after I thought my period finished, the blood kicked up a notch and went bright red.... and the cramps.... my god! I have ever experienced anything like that in my entire life and they got that bad that I became physically sick and hubby took me to the local hospital as I was in tears and finding no relief from over the counter medications. ER said I'm not pregnant, therefore ruling out ectopic pregnancy, and I got pain and nausea relief, but they seemed very blas\u00e9 about my pain and I got the impression they thought I was being melodramatic. \n\nSo on Monday next week, I will have been bleeding for three weeks straight with the last week being utterly brutal due to the cramping. I am physically and emotionally exhausted. I'm scared to go back to the hospital as they really didn't seem to care and in terrified at GP will also fob me off.\n\nHave any other ladies suffered like this or something similar after an extended delay in getting your first period after your loss?

Loosing my daughter and having a memorial service and whatnot I took a break. \n\nI've done a few things to help me cope. At least I think it helps. I've opened my own business in her honor and been super busy getting that up and running. I'm barely sleeping bc I work once my 2 year old is in bed.\n\nThis year just seems to suck for us though. After all of that pain, hubbys workplace harassment got so bad he had to be placed on suicide watch and was committed to a psych ward for 1 week. It kind of left me and my daughter stranded (no family close. His work sucks. Yay military life) because I don't have a drivers license. Long story. \n\nI'm so sick of 2017. I haven't managed to go to see my therapist since January. Because his workplace told him he can't clock out at 4:30 to take me to appointments bc he's in a supervisory position and needs to be an example... yeah...\n\nAnyways. Now her due date is coming up. I'm supposed to be 39 weeks pregnant now. For a while I was ok. But now with the due date I'm starting to loose it again. All I want is to be able to hold my little girl. I want those sleepless nights. The growth spurt and constant nursing. \n\nBut instead I get to look at her urn. It's so unfair. My best friend is pregnant as well. She was 4 weeks less than me with a little girl. We were both pregnant at the same time with our first kids as well. And now I told her that I'd be blocking her Facebook posts for a while. \n\nI just want my baby.

H and I have had some pretty shitty life experiences lately. \n\nWe have a 14m son and he is my everything, he is smart and handsome and really one of the best kids I have ever encountered (I am sure there is a little bias in there \ud83d\ude09). We tried for over two years with everything but IVF and IUI before finally getting pregnant and it was a ROUGH pregnancy (subchorionic hematoma, borderline preeclampsia, and I was sick 24/7). Since my first pregnancy was so rough we said we would wait until he is 2-3 to start trying again.\n\nMy husband went in for a physical and since he is in his 40's, adopted (no family history) and hadn't seen a doctor since he was like 22 they sent him to a few specialists to help get a better history for him. One of those specialist was a urologist, who saw a small cut on his penis and decided to biopsy it just to be safe. Turns out husband has penile cancer (very very early stages) so with this news we decided to not wait any longer and see what we can do.  \n\nI shockingly got pregnant pretty fast, I had just known I was but wanted to wait for first MP to test but nursing my son was uncomfortable, towels felt like sandpaper and I was peeing all the time (this has been my first symptom with both pregnancies). I was excited but nervous too and thankfully told him don't say a word to anyone until we get a scan. I found a new OB and set up and appt for 8 week scan. \n\nWithin 4 days of our BFP I started spotting, I called the OB told her the history of my SC hematoma with first pregnancy and she said to wait but if bleeding gets worst come in or go to ER for scan to be safe.  I was hopeful that all would be fine and that I just have a shitty uterus that doesn't like to play nice with placentas. Bleeding got very heavy and I went to ER and they were so awfully mean to me.  NP told me I was never \"really\" pregnant and that I probably didn't know how to read a pregnancy test and just go home because I was having a period. OB was furious with them, she requested my records and said it was a textbook ectopic ovarian pregnancy. \n\nWhile all of this was going on we found out husbands biopsy did get everything and he needs to go in for another one, they have to take more and hope this time they get it all, if not he needs chemo and that postpones everything by a long time. \n\nI want another baby so bad but I can't get out of my own way.  I just can't get into it and I feel like sex is a chore.  It's a chore to try and make a baby happen and also a chore to sexually engage my husband before they slice him up again and tell him no stimulation of any kind for like 6 weeks while it heals AGAIN.  I feel awful, I want to want it but I just can't and he definitely notices. \n\nSorry this was so long and thanks for reading, admitting is the first step to healing right?", "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "ttcafterloss", "subreddit_id": "t5_34scd", "suggested_sort": null, "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Introduction", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/ttcafterloss/comments/67a8cw/introduction/"}, {"author": "berniesherbatsky", "author_created_utc": 1471207471, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_text": null, "author_fullname": "t2_10i9h8", "brand_safe": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1493052420, "domain": "self.ttcafterloss", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/ttcafterloss/comments/67a9bo/healthy_eating_exercise_after_loss/", "gilded": 0, "id": "67a9bo", "is_self": true, "locked": false, "media_embed": {}, "num_comments": 22, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/ttcafterloss/comments/67a9bo/healthy_eating_exercise_after_loss/", "retrieved_on": 1494629840, "score": 7, "secure_media_embed": {}, "selftext": "After my second MC in early March, I said F*** it and stopped working out, drank wine during the week (which I never do) and indulged in way too many carbs. \n\nI felt like my body let me down so it didn't deserve the best from me.

I'm curious if anyone else on prog has had this experience? What does this mean? I reached out to my obgyn with questions. I assume it's just the prog making the lining more thick and fluffy, but interestingly endometrial cysts are very hard to find online in scientific sources, save for endometrial hyperplasia, which I doubt I have as all my US prior to, during, and following my MC showed a normal lining. \nOn the bright side, my premenstrual spotting has stopped. \nThanks for your thoughts.

I had two miscarriages (one very very early, one at 12 weeks with twins). On the third try we had luck and I stayed pregnant with a beautiful baby girl for a whole 39w5d. \n\nIt was a perfectly normal pregnancy, but she had a couple of heart defects that were discovered after birth. It was a completely operable condition, and although that was mighty scary the doctors were really optimistic, and we left the NICU with a mostly healthy baby. \n\nThree weeks later she stopped breathing in the reception area for a CT Scan at a wonderful children's hospital -- we were so lucky to have been there when it happened, but she never breathed on her own again. They diagnosed her with tracheal stenosis and told us that it was effectively a time bomb, sooner or later it would catch up with her, it just happened at 3 weeks old.\n\nIt's closing in on three months since she died, and while I'm nowhere near ready to get pregnant again, I know deep down that's what I want. Aside from grieving our baby as a person, I am brought back to the years of wondering and grieving \"a baby\" in general. \n\nMy husband was already concerned about being an \"old dad\", he turned 43 on what would have been her 3 month birthday. I'll be 36 this summer, and I feel like we are under a lot of pressure if we ever want to have living children. If we were in our 20s I wouldn't even be making myself think about this right now and would just concentrate on mourning our baby. \n\nI also spend a decent amount of time reading blogs and scrolling through online support groups. While that is super comforting in the moment, it leaves me with this fatalistic view that babies are statistically more likely to die than live. Before this stillbirth and SIDS were things I was aware of, but I'd only ever known one couple who had a stillbirth. Now it feels like those are the only options after an otherwise healthy pregnancy. You can show me the statistics, but I can show you ten blogs of women who *were* that 1 in 10,000. \n\nWhat if I encourage my husband (who's understandably terrified of the whole idea) to try again and we have another baby who then dies of SIDS? I would never forgive myself, and I think we would both just stop living completely. \n\nWhat if we try again and face miscarriages again? That's a statistic that's a bit more likely, and still terrifying. \n\nAny thoughts would be appreciated. \n", "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "ttcafterloss", "subreddit_id": "t5_34scd", "suggested_sort": null, "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Introduction/Seeking Advice [trigger warning - death of infant]", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/ttcafterloss/comments/67rxfq/introductionseeking_advice_trigger_warning_death/"}, {"author": "AutoModerator", "author_created_utc": 1325741068, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_text": null, "author_fullname": "t2_6l4z3", "brand_safe": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1493276717, "distinguished": "moderator", "domain": "self.ttcafterloss", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/ttcafterloss/comments/67u1uv/ttcafterloss_ttc_daily_discussion_thread_april_27/", "gilded": 0, "id": "67u1uv", "is_self": true, "link_flair_css_class": "ttc", "link_flair_text": "TTC Thread", "locked": false, "media_embed": {}, "num_comments": 41, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/ttcafterloss/comments/67u1uv/ttcafterloss_ttc_daily_discussion_thread_april_27/", "retrieved_on": 1494639824, "score": 3, "secure_media_embed": {}, "selftext": "**This thread is for members who are TTC or waiting to try.

I'm a long time lurker and first time poster. (TW: loss, graphic medical discussion) \n\nI had a MMC at 12 weeks back in March. I had a pretty traumatic experience which I'm struggling to move past. I was not an ideal candidate for a d&amp;c because I had previous surgery on my cervix for cervical cancer and my OB wanted to avoid any additional scarring or damage. So I had several failed rounds of cytotec at home and then ended up being admitted to L&amp;D to induce the mc. I received several more rounds of cytotec over 24 hours and while my cervix dilated a little bit, the tissue would not pass. My ob ended up using forceps to remove what he could manually, while I was completely conscious in the labor suite. This meant my little boy was taken from me piece by piece until I was ultimately rushed down to surgery for a d&amp;c since the placenta adhered to my uterus and I was starting to bleed out. Note, I was not in any significant physical pain during this time and completely trust and respect all of the clinical decisions my OB made. I was just not prepared for the mental anguish which would follow.\n\nTo make matters worse, my best friend was also pregnant - just a few weeks ahead of me. I was so excited to go through this experience with her and to have our kids grow up together. After my loss, she was great - respectful and sensitive. She stopped sharing all of the details we once commiserated over, and I understood and appreciated why. However, when it came time for her baby shower, I told her that I couldn't go as it would be too hard for me. I thought she would understand given how supportive she was initially. Instead, she was upset and hasn't spoken to me since. I think my grief/depression started to wear on her during what should be a happy and exciting time in her life, and now my selfishness and inability to be a good friend (albeit out of a sense of self-preservation) likely was the last straw. \n\nBesides my husband and therapist, I don't have anyone else to turn to anymore. I am lost, sad, and struggling. I thought I would reach out here. \n\n**TL;DR: In the last two months I've lost my child and best friend.** \n\n**Edit: Happy update! Spoke with my best friend and explained more about my situation/feelings. Things are much better. Thank you for all your comments.

So it does seem like just horrible luck, but I don't want to wait until a third to find out there was some underlying cause after all. And I love my doctor's and his staff, but it seems like they are much more equipped to deal with normal healthy pregnancies. They don't seem to deal as well with high risk pregnancy. I also have no idea what tests to even get. I just want a doctor that will be a little more involved in the early pregnancy next time. Someone who will order beta and progesterone testing right away and put me in progesterone or baby aspirin, if needed.\n\nTo be honest though, I'm mostly just scared to get any of it done. \n\nSo what type of testing would you get done?
