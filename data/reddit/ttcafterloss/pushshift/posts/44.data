I'll try to keep it short, but she met husband, married, and got pregnant in less than 2 years. She straight up told me she didn't want kids for a long time, but guess what happened 1 month later.\n\nShe announced at Christmas, which was less than one week past my should have been due date. It was so unexpected that my husband and I had to hide away for an hour. The inlaws asked if everything was alright which made us tell them about our loss. We figured that they would be courteous around us, knowing what was up.\n\nI guess not, because SIL didn't seem to remember or care. She straight up asked my husband to paint her nursery. She also spent Mothers day sewing cloth diapers in front of us. I feel like she has never even cared to ask how we are doing.\n\nI started slowly going on social media blackout closer to her due date. Then on June 2nd, I got another positive test. Unfortunately I lost it again. We told the parent inlaws and they basically gave us the cliche \"just relax\". They have never been great with support or asking how we are doing.\n\nSIL had baby June 27th. She was texting my husband while she was in labour, but never actually told him she was in labour. We only found out the next morning when FIL texted us. She hasn't reached out or contacted me in any way since before the birth. Any new information was sent to only my husband via group text. \n\nShe asked us to drive 3 hours to her place to meet the baby on the 30th. We declined saying we were busy but all the other SIL went. MIL and FIL have been there for the last 11 days.\n\n_____________________________________________\n\nToday I feel like I reached a point where I could finally look at her facebook to see pic, but I find I still get really sad/angry/jealous/bitter feelings. Part of me wants to meet up only because I love babies, but I'm also really afraid that I am not ready to do it. I didn't want to meet with MIL around anyways (for long story reasons). I figured we could put it off until we are ready.\n\nHowever our whole next 2 months are completely filled up on weekends. This Saturday is our only free weekend until the end of August. Logically, if we are going to rip the bandaid, it has to be this week, but MIL will be there and I am a mess of emotions.\n\nI know that I should wait until ready, but I also have this crazy fear that they are pissed at us for not being super happy and supportive. If we don't go visit for 2 months, I worry that they will grow bitter and angry at us (even though it is the other way around). SIL is the golden child so I'm sure inlaws will take her side. Other SIL already gave us some mild shit for not sucking it up and going with her. Husband is coming to terms with the fact that his family runs away when we have real emotional problems, but I don't want to cause more strain because of my feelings.\n\nSorry for this mess of a post. I hope it makes a tiny bit of sense.\n\n______________________________\n\nTLDR: Having a hard time with SIL. Feel like I should go meet her new baby but I don't think I'm ready. If we don't go this weekend we won't be able to go for several weeks. Afraid they will get angry and cut us out of the family, but also afraid of having a break down in front of them.

I just feel deep down there is an underlying issue. Am I just being negative? Is it just overwhelmingly likely that I had bad luck?\n\nWhat are your thoughts on progesterone? Should I ask for it? Test for thyroid issues? MTHR? Should I take baby asprin just in case? I have a symptom indication that I have low progesterone (brown spotting before my period every cycle). Underactive thyriods run in my family and I have been chronically fatigued since I was 19 (though I never sought treatment for it). I also think I'm a bit of a hypochondriac and those things may be nothing.\n\nWhat are your thoughts? Should I push for testing?

I lost my baby on Saturday at 15w4d; I chose to be induced so that I could meet/hold my baby. It was a girl, what I had wanted so badly - we named her Stella Rose. Here is my (long) story...\n\nMy fiance and I had been sort of trying for almost a year, when we got serious last December and I downloaded Fertility Friend to track my BBT and also started losing weight using MFP (myfitness pal). In 4 months, I lost close to 45 lbs and my periods began to regulate - in April, I found out I was pregnant. I was in disbelief, but overjoyed! My pregnancy was un-eventful at first, no morning sickness, constipation or any other inconvenient symptoms. I had been running since I started losing weight, but began to limit myself to run/walk as I was trying to keep my heart rate below 160 which was almost impossible in the heat. I had registered for a 5K race in June which I wasn't sure about, but i went ahead and participated... just mainly run/walking then sprinting at the end. This was at about 10w3d.\n\nCut to 11 weeks pregnant, I got home from work and went to the bathroom - wiped - blood. Cue: panic! Called my fiance and we went to the ER. In retrospect, this was just some spotting so I definitely could have just gone to my clinic the following day.. however the ER did diagnose a UTI and we saw the baby jumping around with a healthy heartbeat. I got some antibiotics and was on my way instructed to follow up at my clinic that Friday.\n\nFridays follow up was with a t/v ultrasound, baby was fine and cervix was closed - instructed to finish antibiotics. Then over the weekend the bleeding worsened to red in color and more than spotting. I went back on the following Monday to my OBGYN and he referred me to a Maternal Fetal Medicine clinic, baby was still doing fine at this time but he spoke those words.... \"threatened miscarriage\" which are awful to hear.\n\nOvernight the bleeding increased a lot, to the point that we were convinced the baby was lost - we mourned our baby and just cried in bed waiting for our appointment with the specialist later in the day. Again, baby was doing great on the u/s at the specialist - fluid levels were great, and baby was strong. They diagnosed me with a subchorionic hematoma (not on the placenta side). I was told the chance of miscarriage was now higher but not by much, and instructed to take it somewhat easy, pelvic rest, and to come back in 3 weeks for a check.\n\nThe bleeding slowed and turned to brown over the next weeks, I was feeling positive but still scared. I went home to visit my family over the 4th of July, but the bleeding had come back a little bit - mainly just a bit more red than before which I noted but tried not to panic. The specialist doctor told us the signs to look for would be intense bent-over pain, or hemhorrage (i.e. filling 2 pads/hour) and I was no where near either of those. For 2 days while I was visiting family, there was NO bleeding.... but I noticed my pad was slightly wet... which I tried to push to the back of my head but the fear lingered. Then after some dinner one night, I felt a gush - a big gush. Rushed to the bathroom and had completely filled a pad in 1 minute - was so scared. We were 5 states away from our Doctors and this did not seem normal. I cried all night as we contemplated what to do. By the morning the bleeding had somewhat slowed, we decided we could make it to our 15w appointment back home in 2 days and try to relax.\n\nOver those 2 days I was miserable in fear, I knew something was very wrong - but my fiance tried to stay positive. We got back home and went to that appointment... the ultrasound tech found the heartbeat but was very quiet, I asked about fluid and she said \"not much fluid\" you could tell the baby could not move, it was terrible. I knew something was so wrong, but I held on hope as there was still a heartbeat...\n\nThe doctor came in and told us our options... basically, there was no fluid, not a drop. The baby's lungs cannot develop without fluid, and at that point we were just in a waiting game for the baby to pass. We decided on induction, as now my health was at risk due to no fluid and the possibility of infection of my uterus. This was on a Thursday afternoon, they scheduled the induction for Friday at 5pm. I treasured the last day with my baby living inside me, we spent some time walking around the University hospital gardens in the hours before the induction, which brought some peace - but my heart was completely broken.\n\nThey induced me that night, the hospital doctors and nurses took such good care of me. I gave birth overnight to my baby girl, Stella Rose, and she was perfect. We got to hold her and touch her, and take pictures; and I will treasure that forever. Unfortunately they had issues getting my placenta out which left me extremely nauseous for much of that time. I am struggling with some regrets of not holding her for longer, but I was holding a puke bucket most of that time.\n\nIt was hard to leave the hospital as that is where I had to leave my baby, it has only been 4 days since I gave birth - and I am healing physically, but I know the emotional healing will take much longer. My milk came in yesterday, so I am longing to nurse my baby and so sad that I cannot. I feel empty in my womb, and I long for my baby. I want my baby to matter, but I fear so many will just view this as a mc that I need to move on from (not that MC are easy by any means to move on from but there is the societal view that they are, which is awful). I know this was a mc, but since I gave birth and the baby was alive the day before - it feels different. I am caught in a sort of limbo of thoughts about how everything went down, and how to think/talk about my loss in the future. Technically this was not a stillborn as the baby was only 15w, but I also have a hard time thinking of this as a termination as we just did what was medically necessary. To me it seemed the baby was totally healthy, and it was a spontaneous membrane rupture probably due to infection after weeks of bleeding... but I may never know. They did send the placenta for testing so that may give me answers eventually but I am aware I may never have an answer.\n\nWe want to start trying again right away, but I know the next pregnancy (if I am so lucky) will be filled with anxiety and fear. I had passed the \"safe zone\" with the last one, yet still lost my baby. We are attending a support group at the hospital clinic tomorrow, and I have taken this week off work - but I am having anxiety about returning. There is a gal I work with who is due 4 days after I was due (which was Christmas). I fear the holidays now as I will have to deal with Stella's due-date and will always remember on Christmas that I should have my baby. Sometimes I feel like the only thing that will make me happy again will be to get pregnant quickly, and this thought process scares me also because I realize this is probably unhealthy and also it puts a lot of pressure on myself.\n\nThis was a lot of rambling, I needed to get this out somewhere so thanks for reading. I plan to start trying right away, so will be around here a lot more. Once my bleeding stops, I plan to upgrade my FF again to VIP and start tracking BBT. This seems like an amazing community, so thank you for having me.

I've been lurking for a few days now and finally decided to introduce myself. I'm Rachel! I'm 28, and my husband is 27. I have one son, who turns 7 next month, from a previous relationship. So we were/are trying for my number 2 and his number 1. \n\nI had my last injection of the depo shot in September 2015, and we were NTNP until I got my period back in August 2016 and then we actively started trying. We successfully conceived on cycle 8 and we were so excited! Went for my first ultrasound at 6w2d and baby was measuring exactly on track and had a heartbeat of 114. We felt confident enough to announce to all of our friends and family, and then to Facebook about it. Which I regret now, but I am glad for the support I am receiving. Last Thursday, I went for just a regular appointment with my doctor at 9w4d. My husband had just left town for a bachelor party 10 hours away so I went by myself. During a surprise ultrasound we discovered that there was no heartbeat and the baby was measuring at 9 weeks exactly so it had just happened. I'd had no spotting or bleeding, and was still having normal symptoms. \n\nI was completely blindsided. And to have to find out alone was even worse. My husband got the first flight home he was able to and hasn't left my side this whole time. He's been my rock. I had my D&amp;C on Tuesday and all went as planned and my doctor is sending the fetus off for genetic testing to see if my chromosomal abnormality could be what caused this. \n\nMy husband and I talked to the doctor, and have decided to start trying again immediately. Sorry for the long backstory. \n\nNow for my questions... For those of you who have had a D&amp;C done, how long until you started your period after the procedure? \n\nHow long did it take for your hcg levels to go down to zero? \n\nIs it okay for me to start vaginally temping again now, or do I need to wait until the two weeks after the D&amp;C? \n\nAny help is appreciated, and I'm so glad to have found this community! I feel less alone now. \n\nTl;dr Baby had no heartbeat and stopped developing at 9 weeks, had a D&amp;C, and just wanting to know what to expect after the surgery.

(Never mind that I'm already assuming they'll all be losses, but could we expedite this whole fucking stupid process?)\n\nI feel very much (today) that I solely carry the weight and burden of TTC.

I didn't bother with the subsequent CPs because they all ended at around 4 weeks--which didn't leave much of any time between getting a BFP and scheduling an appointment--and it was really inconvenient to get to her office.  I \"knew\" I was pregnant from home pregnancy tests that went from positive to negative plus symptoms, then bleeding started.  After that discussion, I felt like maybe I still should have seen a doctor about them, but it just felt so futile at the time.\n\nThe initial physical examination suggested everything was OK, but he took two vials of blood and referred me for an ultrasound scan to rule out physical deformities in the uterus and also for genetic counseling.  Blood tests results should be coming back next week, I should get a call from the genetic counselors people in that time as well to match me with a counselor that takes my insurance, and I'll just need to call to make the ultrasound appointment.\n\nI asked if we should wait on TTC this month, and he said he didn't want to tell us no in case chance would have it that this month we are successful in keeping a pregnancy.  Plus if we're going to wait this month, we would probably want to consider waiting until the results are back from the genetic counseling.  So with the information we have now--which really is only that I've had repeated consecutive losses--he sees no compelling reason for us to wait.\n\nIn one of my previous posts a few people had suggested that low progesterone could be the cause.  I asked about it and he said while that is true, I'm at the wrong stage of my cycle to test for it.\n\nSo right now it's a bit of a waiting game, but I already feel a lot better being referred to for scanning, testing, and to specialists.

Husband and I are private people so aside from one work-friend who I trust to not blab, my husband, and my obgyn, I haven't told anyone else about them or that we are TTC.  I don't know if my husband had mentioned it to any of his friends, though it seems he hasn't.  We both agreed to not tell our families about these losses or any future pregnancies until at least week 8. He sees no point in disappointing his parents with bad news after the fact; I fear my well-intentioned-but-overbearing parents will be judgemental about my lifestyle and pry about treatments, my doctor appointments, etc., and stress me out even more.\n\nAfter all these months of holding this in I now have the urge to confide in specifically two of my friends about the losses.  I don't think I'm necessarily looking for support, I just\u2026 want to talk about it sometimes. Maybe that's the same as support.  Anyway, right now it feels like I'm hiding a big bad shameful secret when it is simply a life experience.  I trust these two friends to not gossip should I ask them not to so I'm not worried about that.  I *am* worried that should either of them become expectant mothers in the near future, they may avoid telling me out of consideration that the news might be upsetting, even if I emphasize that I have no problems being around pregnant women or babies.  And yes, while it would sting initially (especially if I still haven't managed to keep a pregnancy by then), I would rather just deal with the emotions upfront than to find out later on that I was excluded *and* have to deal with the emotions anyway.\n\nWhat are your experiences with this?  Any advice on how to approach the decision?  If I do decide to tell these friends should I run it by my husband first?  When I mentioned that I had told my work-friend (this was soon after our first loss), he seemed taken aback that I did after we had a talk about keeping it a secret from family and friends (which in my mind referred to long-time friends from school).", "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "ttcafterloss", "subreddit_id": "t5_34scd", "suggested_sort": null, "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Those who had told family/friends/work about their losses, did you come to regret it later?", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/ttcafterloss/comments/6nuplj/those_who_had_told_familyfriendswork_about_their/"}, {"approved_at_utc": null, "author": "AutoModerator", "author_created_utc": 1325741068, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_text": null, "author_fullname": "t2_6l4z3", "banned_at_utc": null, "brand_safe": false, "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1500361679, "distinguished": "moderator", "domain": "self.ttcafterloss", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/ttcafterloss/comments/6nz689/ttcafterloss_ttc_daily_discussion_thread_july_18/", "gilded": 0, "id": "6nz689", "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_css_class": "ttc", "link_flair_text": "TTC Thread", "locked": false, "media_embed": {}, "num_comments": 68, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/ttcafterloss/comments/6nz689/ttcafterloss_ttc_daily_discussion_thread_july_18/", "retrieved_on": 1502115867, "score": 5, "secure_media_embed": {}, "selftext": "**This thread is for members who are TTC or waiting to try.
