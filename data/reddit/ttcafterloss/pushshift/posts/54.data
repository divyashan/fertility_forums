Had an ultrasound and the doc could see absolutely nothing, just a little pocket of fluid in my uterus. It\u2019s definitely not viable, and I\u2019m seriously hoping at this point the HCG has hit its little peak and will plateau and/or go down on its own by the next time i go in, but part of me wants to take the methotrexate and get it over with because I\u2019m so terrified of rupturing a tube if it did indeed implant there.\n\nI\u2019m not sure what to expect, side effect or pain wise. My other option was to do an endometrial biopsy first, which would essentially accomplish the same end goal (disrupting the growth of this tissue), only it just seems unnecessary to put myself through something so painful. I guess the crux of my question is... for anyone that\u2019s experienced this and presented with those two options, whatd you go with? What can I expect? A long road of getting my cycles back to normal?  This is all very scary, stressful and sad, not to mention isolating. I don\u2019t regret sharing any of this with close friends but I\u2019m almost irritated with all their optimism like \u201coh well look you CAN get pregnant after all\u201d like just no.

We plan on having her serum iron tested again for sign of overload (ferritin tests can be wrong in those with thalassemia), but in the mean time, we want to find her an iron-free prenatal with folate.\n\nWe've found Iron-free prenatals that contain folic acid, and folate-containing prenatals that contain iron, but none that is iron free and contains folate.

The doctors assumed we lost him due to either a genetic defect or underdeveloped kidneys/lungs. Genetic issues were a real concern because my husband's family has a lot of genetic abnormalities. \n\nThe doctors advised against an autopsy because if the genetics didn't show anything, than the likelihood was it wouldn't repeat in further pregnancies. Cue three months of genetic tests on both my husband and I, testing on the placenta, and two very invasive internal exams to make sure I didn't have defects with my uterus. Everything came up as normal, or as the geneticist said \"genetically boring.\" \n\nBecause of this, our original wait time has gone from six cycles to three. My third cycle is next week. I have a pre-conception meeting with a maternal fetal medicine doctor on day 2 to decide how to proceed once I get pregnant again. I was so excited, but suddenly I'm having flashbacks of my first pregnancy and the loss of my son. Sometimes they are so vivid I can actually smell the baby oil they rubbed on his skin, and can feel his skin touching mine. It's making me feel apprehensive to try again, even though the doctors are assuring me that this was random and only has a 5% of recurrence. I know that pregnancies are never perfect or easy. Something ALWAYS goes wrong, even if it's minor. But I am so freaked out I feel like I'm reliving my loss! Has anyone else experienced this? \n\nLast time, we told family at 9 weeks and friends at 12, and everyone got so excited and began giving us baby items, which are now boxed up in my mom's storage room. This time, I'm not sure I want anyone to know when we are pregnant until baby is 20 weeks and showing as heathy, since that's when we found out about my son's issues. I don't want to announce to extended family or anyone I don't see on a near daily basis until after baby is born and home safe. I'm freaking out.

At 7 weeks I had a fairly heavy bleed. I thought I had miscarried, but the ultrasound showed TWINS! Two healthy tiny babies... and a tiny bleed behind one of the placentas. But the bleeding stopped and all seemed well. We were very nervous... a high risk pregnancy as our very first. But at 12 weeks we allowed ourselves more excitement, real hope... the statistics were with us. Diamniotic dichorionic twins were very likely to go to 36 weeks if not 38 even! At each ultrasound all was well. Couldn\u2019t see the previous bleed... babies growing perfectly well... the 20 week ultrasound confirmed we had a baby girl Eleanor and a baby boy Otto. As the first grandbabies on both sides, family immediately began sending me clothes, books and nursery furniture. We were so ready. \n\nOn January 24, I woke up at 5 am with bad pelvic pain. I thought it was constipation... it went away soon. Then it woke me up again an hour later, and I had some bleeding. We went to the ER and by 7 am the doctor on call told me, \u201cyou\u2019re in labor. Your cervix is completely dilated.\u201d I felt my world crash down... \u201cbut they can\u2019t survive... what if I stay on bedrest? Are you sure there\u2019s no cervix left? What about a cerclage? Can I be shipped somewhere else?\u201d I knew the answers already... \n\nAfter 12 hours of wrestling with the idea that our lives would suddenly no longer be centered around the promise of our babies\u2019 futures here on earth, I agreed to an epidural, which relaxed my body enough that Otto came into the world. Ellie came 23 minutes later. My husband and I held them their entire lives... nearly 4 hours for Otto and nearly 3 for Ellie. They spent their lives in our arms and side by side. I know they knew our love. They made us parents, they changed us. \n\nNow I grieve with the heaviest of hearts alongside my sweet husband. We will never be whole again... two pieces will forever be missing. \n\nThe working theory is the subchorionic hemorrhage must have still been present and turned into an abruption. Little Ellie\u2019s placenta just couldn\u2019t hold on any longer. I did suffer a fall on the ice 48 hours before, landing on my bum. My doctor has assured me over and over that a fall on the bum wouldn\u2019t cause this. If it did, she says it would have happened that same day. I hope she\u2019s right, but at the same time I don\u2019t know if I can accept that this is a mere coincidence. \n\nMy doctor says we can try to conceive again as soon as I feel ready. It\u2019s only been a week and a half. But I\u2019m so ready to hold babies in my empty arms. \n\nI\u2019m here looking for support, thoughts and prayers if you pray and new friendships forged in our shared horrible experiences as mothers.

I got pregnant in July after two years of trying. I've always been anovulatory but it got worse after two rounds of cancer treatment (last one May 2013).\n\nSo got pregnant, super happy. Then he was measuring small and we lost him at 23 weeks on December 28.\n\nI was able to deliver him and the placenta naturally. I obviously bled for a while. Negative pregnancy test on the 9th and Blood HCG at 4 on the 15th. I had \"fresh\" blood on the 18th which my doctor and I believe was CD1. I had a light 5 day period. I had been temping (although I can't make heads or tails of it, cross posted to r/TFABChartStalkers) and using OPKs. According to the OPKs my peak fertility was on CD17 (Saturday). Sunday evening I had brown spotting/discharge and today it seems to be more red.\n\nI have a call into my RE but just wanted to see if this has happened to any of you or if it makes any sense.\n\nThanks!!\n\n**Update:** Officially seems to be a period. It makes no sense to me since I supposedly ovulated Saturday (although the temps make no sense: https://www.reddit.com/r/TFABChartStalkers/comments/7vew8y/introspotting_with_ovulation_story_in_comments).\n\nBut if it is a period I had a super short cycle.

I lost 10-15 pounds when we started TTC, and after a few months in the normal BMI range for my height, I started ovulating and conceived my second cycle where I got a positive opk. After he was born, I wanted to start trying right away for #2 because I didn't know how long it would take to conceive again. My period returned 8 months PP with some regularity, but I'm 99% sure I was not ovulating (my son still breastfeeds frequently). \n\nCurrent Issue\nSo, my LMP was Nov. 27th. I believe that I ovulated right around Christmas. On Jan. 9th I had what I thought was a very light two day period (unusual for me, but I didn't really think much of it). A week later I had some really light spotting for two days. That hasn't happened since I was pregnant (I had spotting throughout my whole first trimester), so I decided to test and got a very strong positive on Jan. 21st. I kept testing every other day and my line kept getting darker. On the 27th, I started bleeding a little heavier. It still wouldn't fill a pad, but it was brighter red and I just knew something was off. The next week my HPTs were getting lighter and I noticed less pregnancy symptoms. At that point, I knew it was over. So, I got an ultrasound Feb. 1st and there was nothing there. I was really shocked because I had had such dark tests for so many days, I figured there would be something. The number one concern at that point was that it was ectopic. They did blood work and my hcg was 257. They tested again 48 hours later (this past Saturday) and my levels had dropped. I'm not sure by how much, the midwife didn't say when she called. She said that she thinks it is a chemical pregnancy and they are going to continue doing blood tests until my hcg goes down to 0, and hopefully I won't need any other intervention. Since I started bleeding on the 27th, it has not been enough to even fill a panty liner and sometimes drops off to almost nothing. I guess I'm just wondering how long this could go on for? Has anyone had any similar experiences? I would really just like to get this over with so we can get back to trying.

I had no symptoms of miscarriage (no cramps, no bleeding). Doctor wanted me to wait for a bit, so I did, but after about 2 weeks of waiting, I started spotting very lightly, and decided to take misoprostol at the recommendation of my doctor. I wanted D&amp;C, but he said that he was afraid that I might have scarring in my uterus. 1st pregnancy, 1st miscarriage. \n\n**8PM**\nI started cramping and having contractions, so even though I had originally planned to take the med the next morning (so I will have a whole day to 'labor'), I went ahead and inserted misoprostol (first 4 pills) vaginally. I waited and within 30-40 minutes, I could feel some burning sensation, and increased pain in my uterus that would come and go in about 5-10 min interval. I was laying down, trying to relax. \n\n**10-11 PM**\nFirst gush and blood and tissues came out. I could feel it coming, too, so I was able to do this in the bathroom. Along with blood, a small egg-size grey-ish mass came out. I thought this was the sac + baby, so I started tearing up, but when I broke it open, there was nothing in there that looked like a baby, so I flushed it down the toilet. Contractions along with severe back pain continued. I inserted 4 more pills as directed.\n\n**11:45PM**\nThe pain was at its worst, I was cold and shivering, and the blood/clots/tissues size of my fist were now coming up so quickly and constantly, I just decided to sit in my bathtub, naked from waist down. No position was comfortable, so I kept switching between standing and squatting/sitting. Every time I squatted, more stuff came out. I could no longer feel the pain because I was so focused on getting everything out. The blood and everything else literally filled the tub. I went through every single clot to find the baby. And finally, I did -- at around 2 AM. A small pinky sized baby was found in one of the bigger clots. It had perfect little arms and legs and eyes. I cried and my husband came and hugged me. I scooped everything else into the toilet and flushed, and decided to take a shower. It was around 3AM. \n\n**3AM**\nI finished showering but this was a mistake, as I started to bleed and expelling a lot of stuff again. I did not know that I could have so much stuff inside of me. I did not even get a chance to dry myself with a towel, but just had to squat back down, watching more and more blood and tissues come out. I was getting so tired by now. \n\n**4AM** \nI suddenly realized that I had not been drinking water, so I started drinking a huge bottle of water...then I had to pee so I sat on the toilet. Then out of nowhere, I started to feel dizzy, and I looked down, expecting to see urine come out of me, but instead it was bright red blood shooting out of me -- it was as if there was a blood filled water gun inside of me, and someone was shooting. I filled the toilet with blood and I started to get scared for the first time. Within 10-15 min (blood coming out the whole time), I felt light-headed and passed out. My husband came in (he says he heard a crashing noise -- prob my arms knocking over some stuff as falling) and found me collapsed and mumbling gibberish. I was in a weird half awake, half asleep state. Somehow I came back and had some juice which made me feel A LOT better. I felt almost normal, but the bleeding wouldnt stop, so I had to sit back in the tub for about 1 hour. \n\n**6 AM**\nThe bleeding slowed down a bit -- 1 overnight pad per hour -- so my husband decided that he would make me a bed on the floor of our living room. He wanted to put me into a real bed, but I was afraid that I might bleed everywhere, so I opted for the floor, but it was comfortable. Yoga mat + fluffy blankets. It was much more comfortable then the bathtub. \n\n**8AM** \nBleeding finally slowed down A LOT more. I showered and moved to the bed and slept for about 4 hours straight. I only woke up because of very painful contractions. \n\nThat's pretty much it. 12 hours. I have very high tolerance and am physically fit, but oh boy, this was a whole different thing. I am thankful that I did not hurt myself while passing out. Honestly, I don't know why my doctor did not warn me about this. He told me that the pain would be \"moderate to severe cramping like when you have your period\" and that the bleeding would be mild to heavy and that I would need to have a lot of overnight pads. Umm.....no, the pain so extreme that I had to take prescription pain killer every 2-3 hours and the bleeding was so crazy that I did not leave the tub for the most part. \n\nI really do not recommend this whole process to anyone who is as far along as me. I just talked to a friend who miscarried at 6-7 weeks, and she told me that it was a whole different experience for her (about 2-3 hours of heaving bleeding, little tissues, and bleeding stopped after 1 day). For me, I am still bleeding HEAVILY and it has been 4 days. \n\nAnyway, I hope this helps some of you guys out there make a decision. God forbid if I have another miscarriage, I am getting a D&amp;C because misoprostol at home is just a terrifying, painful experience. Have someone with you THE WHOLE TIME if you have to do it.

It went horribly wrong and I had to have an emergency surgery the next day..  They had left one of the gall stones and also severed my lower intestine. In the mist of all that chaos they had told my mother then that I also had an ovarian cyst but at the time she didn't think anything of it and as a  16 year old  niether did I. But years later now that I am having fertility issues I'm wondering if I might have pcos ... there are many reasons why I feel like I may have it... My family has a history of diabetes and I have weight issues along with excess hair growth, I have anxiaty and depression and also had a miscarriage at 9 weeks in 2014 before my husband and I started dating.... there are a bunch of things that just make me think I need to be checked for pcos.... my main question is would I go to a  family doctor to be tested or an obgyn?

I'll try to make it short, but it'll still be kinda long.\n\n\n2 chemical pregnancies before baby number 1. Tried over a year. \n\n\n1 10 week loss and 1 chemical pregnancy  before baby 2, who had a vanishing twin, and borderline low progesterone, just high enough not to need anything. Up to 5 losses at that time.\n\n\n1 chemical pregnancy before baby 3, low progesterone and sch.\n\n\nSeptember 2017 I found out I was pregnant again, needed progesterone again. Had been trying to prevent with symptothermal charting but surprise. Viability scan in Oct showed baby about a week behind the ovulation -based calculations but they assured me everything looked fine, but something felt wrong. About 2.5 weeks later I was in ER, baby measured almkst 8 weeks, almost 3 weeks behind where it should have been by ovulation and still behind the date given any my viability scan, and I was hooked up to heart monitors while the doctor was debating whether or not I needed a transfusion.\n\nI was sent home to use misoprostil and once my bleeding stopped I started nuvaring, the only hormonal method I used in the past without a problem.  So much for that. I ended up with debilitating headaches and was told not to use hormonal methods, so we went back to charting.\n\nMy husband and I agreed that we would be happy with a surprise, but after 7 losses, we couldn't try-try (1 and 2 I charted,used opks, soft cups,supplements, all sorts of stuff, 3 I gave up charting when my cycle went MIA and we conceived while I was starting doctoring to figure out what the issue was) ever again. The last loss broke us, especially me.\n\nWell, now here we are, 4 months after the last loss, the 7th loss, I'm in my fertile window, and my husband mentions that he wants to let nature decide. Not actively try, but what we jokingly call \"normal people try.\" A 4th felt right, but I doubt I can go through the pain of another loss, especially one beyond chemical pregnancy range. \n\nNow for my question:\n\nHow, especially for those with multiple losses, did you get over the fear and decide to try again? I always had some anxiety about trying, but this time is different. I'm literally afraid.\n", "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "ttcafterloss", "subreddit_id": "t5_34scd", "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Intro and a question", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/ttcafterloss/comments/7vo0s9/intro_and_a_question/"}, {"author": "Pandahloohoo", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "brand_safe": false, "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1517931674, "domain": "self.ttcafterloss", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/ttcafterloss/comments/7vo51l/im_having_a_bad_day/", "id": "7vo51l", "is_crosspostable": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "num_comments": 3, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/ttcafterloss/comments/7vo51l/im_having_a_bad_day/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1517979070, "rte_mode": "markdown", "score": 1, "selftext": "[removed]", "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "ttcafterloss", "subreddit_id": "t5_34scd", "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "default", "title": "I\u2019m having a bad day.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/ttcafterloss/comments/7vo51l/im_having_a_bad_day/"}, {"author": "Aridedede", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "brand_safe": false, "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1517977326, "domain": "self.ttcafterloss", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/ttcafterloss/comments/7vtje2/maya_richard_my_little_boy/", "id": "7vtje2", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "num_comments": 9, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/ttcafterloss/comments/7vtje2/maya_richard_my_little_boy/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1518035473, "rte_mode": "markdown", "score": 24, "selftext": "Maya Richard,\nMy little boy.

I suspect I ovulated around 12/27. I had what I thought was a period, but was much lighter than normal, on 1/6-1/9. On 1/18 I started mildly spotting, and on 1/19 I got a positive OPK and also a positive HCG test. So I called my doctor. Beta was 76. Retested Monday, beta 154. Spotting stopped the next day.\n\nOn 1/29, I did some of my normal exercise in the morning, and started having a tight muscle feeling on my left side, near my pelvic bone. On that day it was accompanied by light pink spotting upon wiping, and there was one dollop of what appeared to be dark red CM. Spotting stopped within an hour, didn\u2019t think much of it. \n\nFast forward to 2/1 where we go for an ultrasound. There was nothing. No sac, no yolk, nothing whatsoever. More bloodwork ordered. Beta level a 51, and on 2/3 a 23. Doctor says it\u2019s a MC, and to expect bleeding. Nothing\u2019s happened, and a urine test is stark white. I took an OPK out of curiousness and it was super positive.

How did it go? What should I ask? \n\n**Longwinded Exposition:** I've been going to my ob/gyn office for a long time. I started there because it's the office my mother goes to/recommended when I needed one at 18, and since then, for gyn appointments I've liked them just fine. I assumed that when I got pregnant I would continue seeing them because their location is so conveniently located in a doctor's pavilion connected to a very good local hospital where I planned to deliver one day.\n\nBut since I've switched to the OB side of the same office, I have not been impressed. Even going back to my first appointment when things were \"ok\" I was not really happy with the information I received (aka NONE) regarding my pregnancy. When we went in for my first appointment I got a US, the tech said \"oh you're not as far along as you think. We can't see anything yet. Come back in two weeks!\" and sent us on our way. No vitals taken (weight, bp, nothing) no info packets given. Literally in and out in 10 minutes. And now, since the MMC, it's just been a shitshow. They almost didn't even tell me I was having a miscarriage! I mean, I had figured it out on my own, but I never spoke to the doctor confirming it before some nurse/secretary called me saying \"Your numbers are going down, so just keep getting blood tests every 2 weeks until your hCG levels are zero.\" UM. What? The last time I spoke to the doctor he said there was a 50/50 chance things were fine, sooo what are you telling me? I haven't had *any* bleeding... There's more, but I've told this story a few times. It's in my post history, so I won't get too into it. \n\nBut the bottom line is... Here I am waiting out a MMC. 14 days since I figured it out on my own. 1 week since it was actually confirmed to me, and 5 weeks since the embryo stopped developing at 6w. Still nothing, and my doctor won't discuss intervention until I do one more hCG test, which I'm doing after work today. After this is over, I think I'm done.\n\nI've never had to change doctors before (I've been lucky not to have had a lot of medical issues) so I'm not quite sure what to expect. I've found an OB/GYN office that is at a satellite campus for the same hospital and it is practically right down the street from my house! (current office/main hospital is about 25-30 minutes away.) I imagine I won't have to do much record transferring if I go there since its all connected. Should I call and ask for a consultation appointment when we're ready to start ttc again? Do I have to inform my current doctor about the change, even if it's basically in the same practice, just a different office? I know I should just call the new office and ask, but I just wanted to hear if anyone else switched their OBs after a miscarriage situation, prior to getting pregnant again... Thanks! \n\nEdit: Sorry for the weird formatting of the title...

Every new pregnancy announcement, every cramp, every time I catch a glimpse of the box holding all 5 losses\u2019 worth of hospital bands, ultrasounds, small early baby gifts... just tears at my heart. I\u2019m hurting so bad. And I feel so frustrated because, while I haven\u2019t been totally okay the past few weeks, I\u2019ve at least been relatively numb or able to shift my focus to daily life. It\u2019s currently feeling like our D&amp;C was yesterday and not 5 weeks ago. \n\nNeed to hear from people who get it. \n", "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "ttcafterloss", "subreddit_id": "t5_34scd", "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Not okay.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/ttcafterloss/comments/7wdeeb/not_okay/"}, {"author": "muffinmamamojo", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "brand_safe": false, "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1518218681, "domain": "self.ttcafterloss", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/ttcafterloss/comments/7whjtl/what_do_i_consider_cd1_after_two_dc_procedures/", "id": "7whjtl", "is_crosspostable": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_css_class": "question", "link_flair_richtext": [{"e": "text", "t": "Question"}], "link_flair_template_id": "64bc0a4e-a73f-11e4-8d5c-22000bc1c25f", "link_flair_text": "Question", "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "richtext", "locked": false, "num_comments": 2, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/ttcafterloss/comments/7whjtl/what_do_i_consider_cd1_after_two_dc_procedures/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1518286599, "rte_mode": "markdown", "score": 1, "selftext": "[removed]", "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "ttcafterloss", "subreddit_id": "t5_34scd", "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "default", "title": "What do I consider cd1 after two d&amp;c procedures?", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/ttcafterloss/comments/7whjtl/what_do_i_consider_cd1_after_two_dc_procedures/"}, {"author": "msblk", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "brand_safe": false, "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1518218747, "domain": "self.ttcafterloss", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/ttcafterloss/comments/7whk2j/excuse_my_language/", "id": "7whk2j", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "num_comments": 9, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/ttcafterloss/comments/7whk2j/excuse_my_language/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1518286656, "rte_mode": "markdown", "score": 12, "selftext": "Fuck evaporation lines.

He doesn't know what to say and he just listens as I rant about how everyone else is getting pregnant right now, mostly people who will admit they weren't even trying!\nI don't know about you guys, but the most frustrating thing close friends and family have been saying to me lately (when I bring up my due date approaching) is \"Oh it'll happen soon for you...\" does anyone else ever get that?

I know I\u2019m young and there\u2019s no real reason to think anything is wrong and I probably just have had bad luck but I\u2019m afraid. \n\nHow do I deal with this?

One thing that surprised me was how incredibly unhelpful the doctors office was. When I first got a positive test, they tried to schedule an intake US at the six week mark, but my ob was booked up for three months. So I ended up affiliated with some random new OB, and I think part of the problem was that half my messages ended up with her and half were sent to \"my\" OB. Emails to the care provider got replied to by one of their staff, and then I'd hit \"reply\" with a follow-up question and get a reply to that from someone else. I hardly ever talked to the same person twice so I had to explain what was happening from scratch every time I called in.\n\nHCG results took like 24+ hours to come back (but was magically available 20 minutes after I called to ask where the result was). My email about whether to test (and consider supplementing) progesterone got overlooked. I eventually asked \"isn't waiting missing the chance to do something?\" and they just stuck to the script. \n\nIs this normal? It feels worse than the experiences I had at Kaiser before we switched insurance, but maybe I have inaccurately rosy memories.\n\nSo now, while I know that objectively this wasn't their \"fault,\" I also feel like they didn't do anything to help try to prevent it.  They didn't really care. Right when I most urgently wanted some medical monitoring and possibly assistance, they were unavailable. There was hardly any \"they\" there; it was a group inbox and a phone tree. And their database thought I was still very pregnant, so I kept fielding questions like \"have you been seen yet for this pregnancy\" and having to correct them that it wasn't exactly a pregnancy anymore.\n\nSo now, I want to meet with an OB to make a plan for getting pregnant and what they'll do to monitor hormones etc. the next time. But even though I know it's irrational, I feel so angry at them that I can't exactly bring myself to do that. I don't want to stick with the new OB I randomly picked, because her staff was part of not replying. But how to choose another OB? And maybe this was dumb, but I tried telling the last person I talked to how angry I was, and what I hoped we could do moving forward, thinking that would yield resolution, [ETA: I just described my frustration and how hard it had been to have to repeat the story for every new person, and asked if it made sense to have a follow up appointment; I wasn't yelling at a random staff member], but it only made it worse because she was clearly in phone-manners \"I'm so sorry that happened to you\" as opposed to like, really caring. It was just another database entry to her, it seemed.\n\nSo then I think \"well, it's not healthy to hate your OB's office, and it's not healthy to feel like their hold music is mournfully saying 'I'm sorry you lost the pregnancy,' and it's not good that you know just exactly how many seconds the 'we are experiencing a higher than average call volume' message is, so you need to find a different OB's office.\" But I try researching it and then think, well they're all probably the same anyway, and at least I know the pitfalls with this place, and this is the largest practice group in the area so it's probably the best despite everything. But then I wonder, are they really?? I mean, my dentist is a small office, but they're much more human about things.\n\nAnyway, is this normal? Does anyone have any tips, either about finding an OB's office that's better or for getting over this at least to the extent of making my next appointment? I feel like if I make one, I'll just want to tell them how frustrated I was and then dealing with them trying to patiently tolerate me, and I just want to have a good relationship with some helpful place.\n\nSorry this is kind of a rant.", "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "ttcafterloss", "subreddit_id": "t5_34scd", "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Anyone else have trouble with doctors?

I've posted my story here once before, but here's a quick recap: MMC November 2016 followed by a D&amp;C, then an ectopic and salpingectomy the following March. Since then, we've been unable to get pregnant at all, so we just started seeing a fertility specialist. We've been going through the whole battery of tests for the past few weeks. Prior to my HSG, I (of course) read everything Google had to offer, and got pretty damn nervous! It didn't help that my husband was away for work that week, so I had to go alone. But, with the help of some ibuprofen and half a Xanax, I made it to the clinic. \n\nAs it turns out, I was nervous over nothing. I had fairly little discomfort, even on the side without a tube where they said I might feel more pressure. I asked the NP about it, and she told me that there's a lot of variation in how they perform the test that can lead to very different experiences. My clinic didn't use a catheter with a balloon to keep the dye in there; they just let it flow. Also, instead of asking me to tilt and move around, the X-ray machine was on a mobile arm - I stayed still the whole time. The whole thing took maybe 2-3 minutes. Although I know this is very much a your-mileage-may-vary situation, I would have been less panicked about the procedure if I'd known about the range of ways it can be performed, and which way my doc did it. Hopefully this will help the next freaked out HSG googler :)\n\nPS - my one tube looked good!

I made the decision to wait until now because I wanted to make sure I was emotionally ready before we started trying again. Which was really hard because of some reason after giving birth my sex drive was crazzzzzzzy like never before lol. I mean that is literally all I wanted to do especially during ovulation so I couldn\u2019t wait until February when it was go time! Well this week has been awful. I am so depressed probably as bad as the first week when we lost him. I want to be pregnant again so badly but now I\u2019m scared if this time did work my stress and sadness messed it up. Also I had no sex drive this week, had acne, had a mental breakdown yesterday(which was O day). Is this normal? Did anyone else experience this the first time back trying again? No sex drive, stress and depression? I don\u2019t even want to get out of bed.. I called my boyfriend and he was so concerned he left work.. he never does that. I\u2019m so sad right now.
