I don't know what I wanted her to do (OK, I do, I wanted her to somehow order a growth scan for me), but I didn't feel much better after talking to her. If anything, the appointment made me realize that I need to set more realistic expectations of what I can do for the rest of this pregnancy. I'm done trying to function like a normal person. I'm going to work shorter days, and if we eat takeout every night until this baby is born, I'm not going to feel guilty. I'm tired, dammit, and that's OK.

Pitocin started at 5 am, made it until 10 am before I opted into the epidural. They broke my water very early on, which erupted like in the movies! All that extra fluid. I'm glad we got that one \"traditional\" labor moment, because things didn't go according to plan. Baby's heart rate was dipping with contractions- nothing too low or too long (they never had to push the emergency button). But then around 2-3 my progress stalled at thinned out but 6/7 cm. We waited a couple hours, but said she wasn't seeing what she wanted, and not knowing how long it'd be before we started progressing again combined with the heart rate deceleration, she was recommending a c-section. If I'd been more dilated they'd have recommended labor, but the c-section was the best option to get him out while he was still looking good and before any potential issues could arrive. I was terrified. I wanted to experience birth and labor, and avoid surgery I was awake for. Plus my epidural had started failing on the left side so I was worried about pain. \n\nBut we agreed, and all of the sudden, despite it not being an emergency c-sect there were tons of people in the room, and about 20 minutes later I was in the OR. I was shaking horribly, which was honestly the worst part. I was terrified. My husband was great though. Before I even knew they began, they were pushing on my upper torso saying \"we see the head, shoulders, butt, look at his chubby cheeks!\". And he whimpered right away. We cried. Many times I thought I'd never actually meet him. Apgar of 8 and 9, loud crier. Nice and round and plump since he didn't really spend any time in the birth canal. Pediatrics says he looks great. Born at 4:37 pm. \n\nNo NICU time, though I have to stay til at least Saturday and am really sore at the incision. It was so hard not getting to hold him at first, and being scared to hold him due to the shaking. I'm glad we didn't allow a flood of visitors right away, as at first I think I was so overwhelmed and scared and hadn't gotten the skin to skin I was worried... that I wasn't excited enough? But spending all afternoon,  night and morning with him has been amazing, and I was up all night just holding and checking on him. He's perfect. When he was just born I'd been through 10 hours of labor, an unplanned major surgery a partially failed epidural, and a baby, so I just am reminding myself how crazy that all is. I'm so happy he is here. He's fuzzy all over! He has loud lungs and was a champion latched at first, but breastfeeding is work. My nipples are pretty flat so that's not helping. Can't wait to take him home. Expecting plenty of visitors today.\n\nIn a couple weeks it will be the anniversary of my first loss. This sub has helped me immeasurably, and I'll miss you all.

It was almost three minutes before baby calmed down and let us measure a heartbeat, which was perfectly healthy! \n\nI got the order to schedule my anatomy scan between 18-20 weeks, which just feels so surreal.

Yeah, it's cheesy, but we are just so excited and I can't turn down an excuse for cake.\n\nI also decided to get the Quad screening done to try and ease some worry. It is hard trying to keep my anxiety under control, and since I didn't do the NT scan (super expensive because insurance wouldn't cover it), I want some sort of genetic testing before I go in for my anatomy scan.\n\nMy main complaint at this point is just how achy my body is.
