I wanted to say how grateful I am to all of you on this sub who provide comfort and support to me and others, while simultaneously making me laugh out loud. I was talking with my newlywed friend a few nights ago about all that's going on with me and through tears I described that no one really can understand the struggles of ttc, loss, and ttcal until you've been through it. I told her about how my internet friends have gotten me through and in that moment I truly understood that this isn't \"internet vs IRL support\" but that this sub actually *is* my IRL support. I feel so vulnerable almost all of the time, but here I feel safe and supported. I know what I put out to you all will be not only understood, truly understood, but I can count on you all for actual words of wisdom and advice that does not make me want to climb the walls with frustration. It makes me sad that all women going through what we are might not have such a protective bubble of warmth and support. \n\nI say all this while I am still fortunate enough to have friends IRL that are so supportive and amazing:  I came home yesterday after a pretty overwhelming day to a huge bag on my porch filled with my favorite drinks, soaps, mini bottles of liquor, a book about being \"comfortable with uncertainty\", homemade pumpkin muffins and a balloon of a dog that said \"you are awesome\".  My three girl friends signed the card with lots of love and kisses and I just melted. They are the greatest. And you all are the greatest.

I was just now looking through pictures of a family trip to Germany in 2007.  It was my first time out of the country.  I distinctly remember being very distracted the entire time by thoughts of my boyfriend back home (a boyfriend I don't even remember).  Here I was, in this gorgeous place, seeing these amazing things, and all I could think about was whether my boyfriend was missing me.  I wasn't as present as I should have been.\n\nTraveling and seeing the world has been my dream since I was little.  And I've been lucky enough to have the opportunity to do quite a bit of it, especially now that I have a good job and am financially able to do so.  And for many years, whenever my family (now including my husband and SIL) would go on a trip, it would be the happiest, most carefree times of my life.\n\nBut now, I wonder if I'm doing the same thing I did with that boyfriend back in 2007, but instead with ttc.  It seems like getting pregnant and having a baby is all I think about.  I probably fret over it dozens of times in an hour.  And most recently, when we were doing a long weekend in Toronto, I spent so much time obsessing over ttc that I sort of floated through our trip.  I wasn't very present.  And now that we're gearing up to go to Italy in two weeks, I'm worried it'll be much the same.\n\nI want to be present in my life.  I want to be able to enjoy and focus on the good things now, even though bad things have happened, and could happen again.  That Germany trip in 2007 - spending time with my mom and dad and brother - will never happen again.  It's over.  I have photos, but in ways that truly matter, I kind of missed it.  I don't want that to be the case with every other experience in my life until we manage to have a baby.  My life NOW matters, too.  I don't want to look back on Italy photos in nine years and feel like I didn't truly absorb it because I was mired in sadness and worry.  I want to remember that while having a baby is my dream, traveling and seeing the world is ALSO my dream, and it's not made lesser because I haven't yet done the former.\n\nSorry for the novel - and sorry for the jumbled thoughts.  I just wish I knew a way to be more present in the now, and not so anxious about the things in the future I can't control.", "controversiality": 0, "created_utc": 1475937425, "distinguished": null, "gilded": 0, "id": "d8j7xae", "link_id": "t3_56fxll", "nest_level": 1, "parent_id": "t3_56fxll", "reply_delay": 27224, "retrieved_on": 1478449801, "score": 9, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "ttcafterloss", "subreddit_id": "t5_34scd"}, {"author": "mimikyu5", "author_created_utc": 1469455160, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_text": null, "author_fullname": "t2_zso6e", "body": "I truly feel like I would not be in as good a place I am if it weren't for all you guys.

Husband wanted to try right away, but I didn't think I'd be ready anytime in the next year (OB laughed at my tears when told I was miscarrying and the fear of that happening again was just too much for me to even consider dealing with at any time, but I told husband a year with hope that he would let it go by then haha). Around 5 months after my miscarriage, I really wanted to try again so we found a new OBGYN who is a little on the crunchy side, just like me, and was very sympathetic towards us and our loss. That made me feel much more confident about trying, but the new OB assured us that whenever we decide to try and (eventually) conceive, she would be there for us from beginning to end and beyond, however long it lasted.", "controversiality": 0, "created_utc": 1475971949, "distinguished": null, "gilded": 0, "id": "d8jukz7", "link_id": "t3_56fxjt", "nest_level": 1, "parent_id": "t3_56fxjt", "reply_delay": 61781, "retrieved_on": 1478460721, "score": 1, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "ttcafterloss", "subreddit_id": "t5_34scd"}, {"author": "nekomancer_lolz", "author_created_utc": 1323482953, "author_flair_css_class": "", "author_flair_text": "33, mmc 12/26/14, mc of a twin 4/2012, 1 LC", "author_fullname": "t2_6eq7e", "body": "Preach, sister.

I felt empty inside and wanted to try again immediately, even though we hadn't been actively trying when we were blessed with our too-brief time with our child.  My husband was hesitant even considering trying for another child again (he would probably say I am minimizing his position and that he was actively opposed to trying again).  \n\nI stayed in the sub for quite a while in the waiting to try camp.  And when we did start trying, I ultimately met criteria for secondary infertility because of our difficulties getting pregnant again.  And I did ask myself, if we had started trying immediately, would I have benefited from the fertility boost post-loss and have been saved a long period of heartache?  But of course it is impossible to know.  And my husband simply wasn't in the right place to try again at that point.\n\nI quote Frost a lot myself (\"the best way out is always through\").  When does the hope outweigh the fear?  I think in some ways, being here at all does suggest a certain degree of hope, that it will happen again, and that this time we will get to meet our child.  \n\nI guess I might suggest thinking about both outcomes.  If you did get pregnant immediately, would you be in a good mental place to enjoy carrying your child to some degree, celebrating their life, no matter how long that time may be?  Alternatively, if you waited, would you be able to remind yourself that you made the best decision for you and your future child by waiting, even if you have difficulties becoming pregnant again?  There is no right answer.  Only the answer that is best for you, and best for you guys as a couple.\n\nGood luck with this hard decision, and I am so terribly sorry for your loss.  I wish none of us were ever in the situation of needing to make these heart-wrenching decisions.
