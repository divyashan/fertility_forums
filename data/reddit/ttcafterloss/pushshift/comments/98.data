I lost my shit at work, and took a week off to recollect myself (luckily I work at a great place that was really nice about it). But I didn't.. I was, I am, so broken... My RE basically told me to just keep trying. But the idea alone made/makes me sick.  I never want to go through that, ever again. \n\nAbout five weeks ago, my mom told me she was worried about me. And I broke down. After a while she said that you can't properly grieve something, you haven't ever said goodbye too. \n\nSo, when I got home.. I started talking to my baby. Or at least, who I thought he would be. My mind conjured up this image of a very tall, gangly, socially awkward, 17 year old, ginger boy. And I knew in my heart that he had been my beautiful baby. Or that he would have been. I asked him to stick around for a little while if he wanted.. \n\nA couple nights passed and I kept feeling his comforting presence. Which healed, and soothed. After a few nights I was ready to let him go.. so I said my goodbye. I have never cried so much as I did that night.\n\nBut I have been feeling a bit better. I am not whole, or healed fully. But neither am I this husk of a person anymore.\n\nI am truly not sure if I am ever able to start trying again.. I am not sure I even want to.

I swear by Clearblue Advanced Digitals and supplement them with cheapies.  However, I think that provided you are getting a clear result with whatever you are using (as in, you don't have PCOS or some other issue that means you can't divine a clear positive during your cycle) it doesn't really matter what brand or type it is.  \n\nTracking temps is the at home method to confirm ovulation.  If you want to make sure you did ovulate when an OPK indicated, then seeing a temperature increase shortly after will indicate that it did happen.  This is because sometimes you can get a positive OPK, but it will not lead to actual ovulation.  Some people can have 'false surges' which can mean that you might miss ovulation if you take your first positive as it for that cycle, hence the confirmation via the temperature rise.  \n\nIMHO if you have regular cycles (as in your period shows up around 14 days after you first believe you ovulated) then everything is most likely all fine and good, and temping is just the icing on the cake.  There is loads more you can get into re. temping - check out [Fertility Friend](https://www.fertilityfriend.com/courses/) for a course around it.  \n\nTo be very clear, you don't **have** to do any/either of these methods to get pregnant, and although it's a bit of an old chestnut, provided it didn't take you too long to conceive your loss, odds are good that you will be able to get pregnant again provided you are having regular sex (i.e. two or three times a week).

I fell pregnant again in May and was CERTAIN that this would be the one-- but lost it at 8 weeks again and had to undergo a D&amp;C. my diabetes is fully controlled with the A1C of a non diabetic, so my doc's are sure it likely had nothing to do with the third loss. I'm now waiting to get into a RPL program at the fertility clinic, which is taking AGES, and also dealing with the prejudices of the medical community (refusing to do tests on my husband because \"you can get your wife pregnant\" so it obviously has to be MY fault, as the woman... Completely discounting things like sperm quality and DNA fragmentation). I'm just super tired and frustrated, and angry that my body feels \"broken\" and that I can't do the most basic thing that women are supposed to be able to do.
