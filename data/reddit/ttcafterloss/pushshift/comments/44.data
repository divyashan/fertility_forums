It was a PITA to pump, and I was thrilled at 1 oz. a day. Total 18 oz. over the course of a month. Small, but I'm proud of it. \n\nI tried to get an LC to look at me in the hospital, but they really tried to shake me off. I knew it was likelier than not that I'd produce; I'd still been able to make decent drips up until a few months into my pregnancy. Within a half hour of knowing my son was gone, I knew I wanted to do this. I struggled through hell and back to breastfeed my daughter, and failed in as many ways as I succeeded. If I had the opportunity to save a life from the life that was lost, then I was going to take it. \n\nIt took me a few days to notice that I was dripping in the shower, and wasn't sure what to think. I own several breast pumps and all the supplies from my first kid, so I just went with it. I was in the position to take a long leave of absence from work, so I started pumping. 8-12x a day, drank 100 oz. of water, and ate and drank everything I remembered that could help build supply.\n\nObviously my supply never \"built.\" I think it was just too early, and I didn't have enough hormones to keep it going. I dried up about a month in. But it gave me something to focus on. Every 2 hours, I pumped, because I had to. Someone needed me. I had to provide for them. I had to make up for what I felt I had done to my son. \n\nInterestingly, this helped me more than my LC did. I felt very comfortable \"weaning\" at a month. It didn't effect the return of my cycle too much; AF arrived 5 weeks after my induction, and again 32 days later. So in this way, it didn't effect my fertility, AFAIK. If you went full pedal-to-the-metal and got a huge supply, my best guess would be that it could affect your fertility, but decreasing your pumps per day should fix that. My cycle returned after 9 months PP with my daughter, when she stopped feeding 10x a day and went to daycare. \n\nI'm working with the Milk Bank, a quick Google search or a call to an LLL member can connect you. It typically starts with a phone interview, then a longer survey, then a blood test, and then you can donate. My bank offers free bags, bottles, hospital-grade pump rentals, coolers, whatever you need. They also cover the blood test you'll need to get done to prove you don't have any infectious dieseses (this is what I did today). My bank also has a memorial in their main office for babies whose lives were lost, and whose mother's donated afterwards. \n\nIf you want to try, you're providing a wonderful gift. If you don't, that's okay, too. If you want to do it for a week, then try it for a week. I reevaluated every week to make sure it was what I still wanted, and one week, it wasn't. But if you think you want to try, time is really of the essence to build supply.\n\nThe other thing that I really like about the whole thing is breastmilk jewelry. I have a pendant from when I was breastfeeding my daughter, and have decided to save a little bit of my donation for another one for my son. The lady who does them for me says about 0.5-1 oz. is typical for these types of things. I don't have pictures or prints or even a name for my son. But I have this memento of the lives we saved together. And I think that's beautiful.

First round of IVF we had our miracle. Twins! For as long as I can remember I wanted to be a twin mom. My dream was coming true. My husband and I were over the moon. I had a pretty easy pregnancy and all of my check ups and bi  weekly cervical length checks were prefect. One Sunday I woke up with what I thought were poop cramps ( I hadn't gone in a few days) the pain came and went pretty randomly so I thought nothing of it and continued to pack some boxes for the bigger house we were about to move into. I went to the bathroom later that evening and had bright red blood in the underwear. I freaked and we went to urgent care. After waiting forever I was finally sent to L&amp;D and hooked up to a monitor and waited for a Dr. While i was waiting my water broke. I was checked and dilated to a 6. I was told by MFM there was nothing they could do for our son. I had an incompitent cervix. If some how labor stopped and he managed to stay put until viability he would be born with extreamly underdeveloped lungs and would not survive, but we couldn't induce labor because that would be an automatic death sentence for our daughter. So we opted to wait to give our daughter a fighting chance. Monday came and went with no more contractions and both babies looked good on ultrasound, heartbeats were strong and they were wiggling all over. Tuesday morning they did another ultrasound to check our daughter amniotic fluid. That's when we were told our sons heart had stopped. Our nightmare wasn't over yet. At 9:31 pm on April 11th our beautiful baby boy Samuel was born still. Much of that night is a blur. After delivery I was sent up for an emergency cerclage as a last ditch effort to save our daughter. At 4am on the 11th I was woken up by my water breaking. By noon my blood pressure bottomed out, and I spiked a fever of 103. At 2:21 April 13th our daughter Margaret was born, her heart beat for 1 hour. The Drs are pretty sure along with The incompetent cervix, I had a uterine infection. They can't tell when I got it. It could have been present for weeks, or it could have happened during one of my checks at the hospital. The last 8 weeks have been hell on earth. And I'm not quiet sure how we will get through this.

No medical problems, minus some thyroid and mild anemia, which are both under control.\n\nI was induced and gave birth on April 29 at 10:41 PM. A few days prior, at a 17w appointment, there was just no heartbeat. No warning. I always felt like something was wrong, but had no proof. Birth was uneventful; I was mostly asleep for it. Epidural was amazing. We made the choice not to interact or take pictures in order to spare us the trauma, or find out the sex. I eventually found out the sex of my child by accident. My son. He was also too small for prints. So all we have to remember him by are a baby blanket, his 8 week ultrasound, and eventually, a breast milk pendent. My husband is currently in the process of making a memory box for these things. \n\nHis death was \"inconclusive.\" This is medical speak for \"we don't know, but it's unlikely to happen again.\" My lovely biology friends have reassured me with countless journal articles that rates of loss see a slight uptick again between 16-19 weeks, and the theory is that something that's replicating during that time went faulty, but it's random and, again, unlikely to reoccur for me.\n\nI pumped milk for 1 month following my loss. Partially to give me something to do, and because I wanted my experience to mean something. I'm still struggling with getting the donation in (mail lost my paperwork) but it seems to be wrapping up soon. \n\nThis month will be my first cycle TTC after my loss. I'm hopeful.

Keep taking those prenatals (studies suggest that taking them 3+ months before TTC gives you the maximum benefit), limit smoking and drinking, do some moderate exercise, eat well, and limit or eliminate caffeine. \n\nLots of those TTC here use OPK (ovulation predictor kits), which you can buy in bulk on Amazon (~50 for $12). If you use them 1-2x a day after the 10th-ish day after your period starts, it can predict ovulation roughly 12-36 hours before it happens, so you can have sperm there to meet the egg. Studies indicate that using OPK can increase your chances to conceive by ~10% (up to 40% or so for any given cycle). Others just do the \"sex every other day\" method, as sperms live approx. 12-48 hours (don't quote me on that number, or really any of these, they could be a smidge different).

If this pregnancy doesn't work out, that's what we'll be doing next, and it's a bit scary.\n\nSo I know how you feel, especially with regard to not knowing how to feel haha.

We decided to try again, and were unable to get pregnant for nearly two years. Decided to go through 3 rounds of IUI, all fails of course. Had every test imaginable ran by our RE and we fall under the unexplained category. So we decided we'd give it one last go and pursue IVF. I had a surprise positive right before starting meds. Unfortunately I am in the process of miscarriage #3 as I type, this one we lost at 5+2. Pretty sure I just have piece of shit eggs at this point and I have zero confidence in my body right now.\n\nSo now we reevaluate. I would love it if were able to have a \"free baby\" but who knows when or if I'll get pregnant again naturally. Since I already spent over $3k on IVF meds we may just go ahead and give that a shot and stick to the original plan before this surprise pregnancy threw a wrench in things and gave us false hope.

We didn't have any prenatal testing until our 20 week anatomy scan were it was immediately obvious something was very very wrong. After nearly two hours the MFM came in with results. Our daughter hadn't grown any long bones, so while all four limbs were present, they did not have any bones in them. Her rib cage was shaped like a bell (which confirmed a skeletal dysplasia/dwarfism), but the bell was so narrow at the top that her heart and lungs did not have the space to form properly. She would never be capable of breathing independently. We had lots of confirmation testing and my husband and I were both very sure that a TFMR would be the most humane option for our daughter. \n\n\nSo the rest was a blur. We couldn't think straight we were so shell shocked and grieving, the doctors kept telling us to terminate but wouldn't tell us how or where (it wasn't legal in our state past 14 weeks) and the days kept marching on while we got second opinions. I wanted an induction, but no one would do it, or tell me where/how I could do it. We ended up with only one option: a clinic out of state that would terminate without question up until 24 weeks. It was a three day process. Two days of laminaria, and the final day of the D&amp;E. I'll spare the details of my experience (unless anyone wants it), but it was incredibly traumatic. To this day I will fight to the death to defend TFMR, there has never been any doubt in my mind that termination wasn't absolutely the most loving and humane way to end my daughters life, but the actual process was something I would never put myself through again. Between the second opinions, travel costs, costs of the procedure, genetic testing, and time out of work, we paid approx $10k OOP, which was our entire savings. \n\n\nWhenever we are near any large bodies of water we think of her and talk about her, idk why but that is the place I have always felt closest to her memory. We have her last ultrasound picture, pregnancy announcement, and her name in a memory frame in our home. \n\n\nIf anyone ever wants to talk TFMR with me, as someone three years out from my experience, feel free to PM me anytime :) ", "can_gild": true, "collapsed": false, "collapsed_reason": null, "created_utc": 1499357767, "id": "djuy7wr", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_6llmr6", "parent_id": "t3_6llmr6", "score": 7, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "ttcafterloss", "subreddit_id": "t5_34scd"}, {"author": "lizlemon_blerg", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_text": "30, 2MMCs@8W, 1 CP", "body": "So cool you got an extra peek at your peanut!
