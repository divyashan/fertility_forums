I was prepared for the worst and it was worse than I anticipated but in a different way.  There wasn't any baby talk really, nor did she ask me to feel him kick.  But the second she walked through the door with her very noticeable baby bump, my eyes welled up with tears.  Just from the *sight* of her.  I smiled and quickly looked at my phone to keep anyone from noticing.  She instinctively rubbed her belly the majority of the time she was there, but I can't blame her for that (I'm not even pregnant and I find myself subconsciously rubbing my belly as if I were from time to time).  My husband pointed out to me yesterday that she doesn't seem to be liking the not drinking thing as she kept taking drinks from her husband's beer and spoke about how she had drank a few glasses of wine at their party the day before.  \n\nWe stayed at \"mom and dad's\" house so \"sister\" and her husband left at about midnight on Saturday night.  When I woke up yesterday morning it was just \"mom\" and I up.  She confided in me that she's not loving my \"sister's\" husband.  He's very childish and apparently somewhat verbally abusive to her (she didn't use those words but that's what I'm classifying it as).  They fight all the time and it results in him screaming at her about how everything is her fault- all of their fights, issues, etc..  This has continued through the pregnancy.  She told him that it's not healthy for her or the baby to get worked up like that all the time and he told her \"that's a myth\".  \"Mom\" told me that she doesn't think their marriage will last (something my husband and I suspected from the beginning; they've only been married a little over a year).  Then she told me that when my \"sister\" told her they were pregnant she had a pit in her stomach.  Of course, she's thrilled to be a grandma but she knows what that baby is being born into.  I asked her if my \"sister's\" husband knows what having a baby will be like.  She said no, he has no idea.  He will do zero work and it will be completely on my \"sister\" (he's never gotten out of bed just to let the dogs out).  \n\nI asked her why they started trying 2 years earlier than they had planned on as it was something that's been bothering me (I'm still convinced she wanted to one-up me and be the first one pregnant because that's just how she is- just petty).  She said she has no idea.  I said something about how they managed to conceive on their first attempt and she agreed that it was a surprise.  I made a comment about how I wished it were that easy for us and she gave the typical don't-know-what-to-say response of \"it'll happen\".  Without really thinking I said \"oh, it already has... twice... I just can't seem to keep it\".  She said \"oh, Alison... I know exactly what you're going through\".  We hugged and both cried.  She told me that she lost her first at 18 weeks- something I had never known.  It's amazing how many people have suffered loss and most would never know it.  I really wasn't planning on telling her but I'm really happy I did- I don't like holding that in.  \n\nI've said it before and I'll say it again- this just isn't fair.  Here are my \"sister\" and \"brother-in-law\" in a failing marriage and they were blessed with conceiving on their very first attempt.  Then there's my husband and I, who are so ready to become parents, and we all know the hand we've been dealt.  I've always said that my husband and I are those lucky, lucky people who found the person that we are truly supposed to be with.  So why are we being punished?

It could potentially have caused problems in later pregnancy due to it's size, I was told they'd remove it in the second trimester if it hadn't shrunk. Since I do want to have a baby and it was taking up a lot of space in my abdomen it seemed best to remove it before going again.\n\nThere are so many different types of cysts though that this probably isn't relevant to your situation. Some types do interfere, most won't cause a problem. My reading suggests anything below 5cm is considered fairly typical and likely to resolve itself. Most people have a cyst about that size at the start of the pregnancy from where the egg left the ovary.\n\nRemoving mine has had an impact on my fertility, but it's negative - he had to take some of the fallopian tube to remove it completely.\n\n", "controversiality": 0, "created_utc": 1450716443, "distinguished": null, "gilded": 0, "id": "cy6pqud", "link_id": "t3_3xoblh", "nest_level": 3, "parent_id": "t1_cy6o6zd", "reply_delay": 2524, "retrieved_on": 1451776062, "score": 2, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "ttcafterloss", "subreddit_id": "t5_34scd"}, {"author": "AmarilloByMorning", "author_created_utc": 1388348304, "author_flair_css_class": "", "author_flair_text": "TTC#1 | 3 MCs, 1CP", "author_fullname": "t2_eka0c", "body": "Thanks!
