In a Facebook thread with me and two moms, she invited us to go to a mom/baby cafe with her at the end of May. I was like...are you freaking KIDDING me? I'm sure she meant it to be nice, but it was such a punch to the gut that I would have had my baby boy by then. As if I needed another reminder. She and the other two moms had baby boys months apart, and they would have been close in age to my Isaac. We had already planned play-dates for the four of them. Seeing those three boys together kills me. No, I have zero interest in going to a cafe with a bunch of moms and babies while I drink an extra-large coffee and cry in the bathroom.\n\nI decided to say, \"Thanks, but I don't think I'll be up for it\" and leave the conversation.
