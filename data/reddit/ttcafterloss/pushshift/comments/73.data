That\u2019s because conceiving within 18 months of giving birth increases the odds of some complications in the following pregnancy, including having a premature and/or low-birth weight baby \u2014 especially if conception occurs within six months of birth. That can, in turn, increase the risk of a child having asthma, developmental delays and vision and hearing problems later in life.\n\nExperts aren\u2019t sure why, exactly, shorter intervals between pregnancies has been linked to these complications. It may be because there\u2019s residual inflammation in the uterus from the previous pregnancy, and because the body doesn\u2019t have enough time to fully replenish the vitamins and nutrients required for the following pregnancy.
