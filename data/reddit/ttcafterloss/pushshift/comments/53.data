I am going for the first time this pregnancy to the Dr\u2019s alone. My husband seems to have picked up the flu from somewhere so I\u2019ve been staying at my Mom\u2019s. My mom or Sister didn\u2019t seem to want to go to the appt with me either. :( Going to the Dr\u2019s makes me so incredibly nervous, especially alone - I always feel like I\u2019m going to get bad news. I haven\u2019t been since Thanksgiving so I hope everything is okay. Keep your fingers crossed for me. \n\nETA - ALL GOOD! I don't have to go back to the MFM and will just be monitored by my OBGYN, every 2 weeks now. Baby weighs almost 5 pounds, has hair, placenta is where it should be, good fluid and is in the 60 percentile for growth. I have suspected that my EDD is a little early based on when I know I ovulated but we will see. My Mom ended up coming with me because she saw how nervous I was this morning. This was the first time my Mom has seen the baby this pregnancy and she was SO HAPPY. She also loved meeting my Drs at the OB offices. We went to lunch afterwards and she picked my brain about a million things. It was a good day!
