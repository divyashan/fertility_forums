The weather was beautiful, I had a few moments of relative peace. We got a lot of nice messages that we didn\u2019t really feel an obligation to respond to\u2014 I had kind of warned people that I just wanted to hunker down. \n\nBut my husband\u2019s parents didn\u2019t reach out on Saturday to acknowledge that they were thinking of us, or of Sam. His dad had mentioned earlier in the week that he and his sister and mom (as in, husband\u2019s aunt and grandma) had donated a sizable sum of money to a charity in Sam\u2019s name. That definitely counts as acknowledgement in my book, but I know my husband would have liked to actually hear from his dad. Also, his mom (my MIL) wasn\u2019t included in this donation, which I find so odd since my inlaws are married. (Though\u2014 long story, they live in different states caring for their aging parents and have a very non-functional marriage, even before my FIL moved down to be with his mom for her health. They very much do not operate as a unit and functionally, my husband and I tend to treat them as a divorced couple. But it\u2019s still not hard to put someone\u2019s name on a gift, especially one you are bestowing verbally... my guess is that it just literally didn\u2019t occur to him to make the gift from him and his wife. I know that sounds insane but it is pretty on brand for my FIL.)\n\nAnyways, my MIL *did* text my husband Saturday to tell him she received the Mother\u2019s Day gift we sent her\u2014 a picture frame with some pics of our 3yo. So like, she was alive and texting that day and just... didn\u2019t acknowledge Sam\u2019s birthday. And my husband is so understandably disappointed in both of them, but especially his mother because his dad at least gets partial credit for mentioning the donation earlier in the week.\n\nHe has had to have so many painful conversations with his family about how their tendency to whitewash Sam out of our lives makes it harder for him\u2014 he feels they forget him, he feels they forget Sam, that they just don\u2019t want to deal with us when the harder aspects of this come out. I know I feel differently about my family; I almost wish they would mention it less because their attempts are so clumsy (and occasionally overly sentimental) that I never know quite how to respond. But I absolutely understand that he feels this way about his parents, and has told them as much, and he still can\u2019t convince them to show some love to their son over the loss of his son. It\u2019s hard for me to observe, as someone who cares for him and even more as someone who mainly feels contempt for my inlaws, even aside from Sam\u2019s loss.\n\nI know that we will have to confront this sooner or later\u2014 we are scheduled to have another baby in less than three weeks and I just don\u2019t think that we can silently stew over this in that interim, but I also don\u2019t want to push my husband into dealing with this before he\u2019s ready/figured out how exactly he\u2019d like to handle it to safeguard his own emotional health as much as possible. \n\nAnyways.

The short of it is that I kind of had a gut feeling that things weren't right after the first ultrasound. After the second ultrasound I had betas done. I checked my online chart after the second draw and saw my levels were dropping, and I knew that instant. That's how I found out myself. Getting it actually confirmed by a doctor was something else completely.  \n\nIn the full story, my OB's office hugely miscommunicated things to me basically the whole pregnancy. First, when I called to make an my first appointment the secretary scheduled me for JUST an 8w dating ultrasound. I didn't know anything about the procedures, but I expected that at my first appt I'd get *some* pregnancy info. But nope, just a less than 15 minute appointment where the ultrasound tech/NP told me I measured less than 6 weeks, my dates must be off and to come back in two weeks and try again. I didn't even get my vitals taken! I immediately felt in my gut that the us didn't seem right, but I was hopeful that maybe things were just developing slowly. \n\nTwo weeks later I had another similar us appointment, no vitals taken, no health history asked. This time I still measured at just around 6 weeks. I knew as soon as I saw the screen it was not right, and the tech found no heartbeat. The doctor came in then and told me, not that it was a MMC, no, he said that there was a 50/50 chance of things continuing *normally* from here but ordered betas just to see what was going on!! So, I got the first blood draw. I spent the next week going up and down over it. \"there's a chance!\" vs \"it's a miscarriage.\" and finally after my second draw I obsessively checked my online portal all day and when it came in, I saw my hcg down and I knew for sure it was a MMC. \n\nI waited *two days* for the doctor to call and confirm to me the news, and when I got the call this is what happened: It was some random nurse who called me. She assumed that I had *already had* the miscarriage and the call was just a followup for the blood draw. She said to me something like \"Ok, your levels are going down, so we're just going to have you come in in 10-14 days and make sure they keep dropping. I see you had an ultrasound appointment scheduled here for next week, but I'll just go ahead and cancel that for you, ok?\" I managed to sputter out something like \"Uh... so... what does this mean? I realize that it's a miscarriage but, I haven't actually *had* the miscarriage yet, like, what should I do?? Shouldn't I come in and talk to the doctor?\" and she said, (I kid you not) \"Well, I'll ask him, but I don't think he needs to see you.\" After that I just got off the phone with her. I was too stunned to do anything. \n\nAfter I got my wits about me, the next day I called back and DEMANDED that I have an appointment with the doctor to go over what was happening to me and what I should do. I got an appointment that afternoon. I finally got it actually *confirmed* by the doctor that it was indeed a missed miscarriage. They were nice enough about it, saying sorry it happened and all that, but all in all, it was not a great experience. I have since switched doctors. I won't go through that BS again.
