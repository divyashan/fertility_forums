I was punishing myself for what happened to my son and trying to find control. The next thing she told me was that if I want to get pregnant again not eating and smoking was absolutely not going to get me there.\nI joined a gym and It took a few weeks for me to adjust my eating habits, and I still have bad days where I back slide but now that I have a goal, or a reason to concentrate on being healthy it helps keep me accountable.\n\nI don\u2019t believe in scales ( I do blind weigh ins at doctors) I get really fixated on the number and let the number control me and I think there is more to my health then that one number. I can\u2019t tell you how to instantly reach your goal but I can tell you what helped me get back to having a healthy relationship with my body was finding that motivating reason to focus on health and after identifying that things like getting exercise and making nutritious meals came a lot easier. \n\nAnd in full transparency despite the fact that I did lose the weight quickly (from an extremely un healthy way) I also lost muscle so even though I was fitting into my old clothes I wasn\u2019t looking like myself. That\u2019s when after committing to get healthy again I started working with a trainer and she had me decrease my cardio and start weight training 3-4 times a week and after a few months everything is tighter than before. \n\nTLDR: Take care if your mental health first and identify what motivates you to be the healthiest version of yourself.

We lost our daughter in February, in the 27th week of pregnancy, due to a hypercoiled umbilical chord. My brother and his wife gave birth to their lovely son in April. So the way, I recognize the situation is in regards to my own family. They were of course marked by our loss, and divided between this and happiness for the birth of my nephew. Even so, it didn't take long for them to sort of \"forget\" the grief, and only focus on the new addition to the family. \n\nTo be honest, I don't have the best of relationship with my own parents, but still - I have been disappointed of how the rest of my family and they've acted since the birth of my nephew. When we have a family gathering - which there are a lot of now with a grandchild - I/we never want to be there. It is my mothers first grandchild, and she's all over him. Taking pictures of him when he sleeps, only to come out and put it in my face, saying \"look at this blanket, which you slept in when you were his size, blablabla\". Only reminding me of what my daughter is missing and that she's not here. When my mother does this I do say \"mom, this is really hard for me to look at\", with the tears almost running. Even with me saying so, and the look on my face, she doesn't put it away or go to someone else. \n\nMy grandmother, whom I've always loved very dearly, the last time I saw her, asked me \"is it still as bad\", regarding how I felt about our loss. In addition she at one point said \"maybe it was for the best, that your daughter didn't survive\". Now she's soon to be 92, so I'm trying to give her some slack for these things, but are having a very hard time doing so. In the situation, I'm being honest about my feelings and I explained that nothing was wrong with our daughter, and it was most definitely NOT for the best. I must admit I'm still very resentful towards her atm. \n\nMy nephews parents are great and understanding towards my husband and I, but it takes a toll on us to be around the rest of my family. \n\n*To try to answer your question:*   \nI would always try to be honest. Even if they would react harshly towards your honesty, at least you have been honest to yourselves. Of course you can discuss how honest you should be, and try to say something in a \"nice\" way.   \nHow to address it in a nice way could be next time they put a photo in your faces. Say something alike \"I can see that you're very happy, and I'm happy that you are. But what you're doing is actually hurting my feelings atm\". If you feel like having a break from pictures and such, this could be added. I don't know if this helps, but as I said: true towards your own feelings. I believe this is the best way to find some sort of peace in your own mind, and if they can't understand this - well to be honest, I would try to not see them for some time.
