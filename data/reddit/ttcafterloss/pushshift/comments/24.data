Yeah, I'm back to keeping track again. Even though I was trying not to I kept subconsciously noting where I was at no matter how hard I tried not to. \n\nIn other news I know I've been avoiding talking about this because, well, it's Reddit. I know I've mentioned that my husband missed our daughters birth but unusually don't get into specifics or give a super summerized half-truth version. The day we lost our daughter my dh was on a work trip (hes a forman at a fairly large construction company, so it isn't uncommon for him to have to travel to different sites that they bid sometimes even across the country), and he got pulled over on his way to the air port. Usually not a big deal except that his liscense is suspended, and carries a mandatory minimum 2 month sentence if you get caught driving. He ended up missing the flight and in turn missed Peyton being born. He made it home in time to pick me up from the hospital. Anyway, we hired a lawyer and this whole thing just went to intermediate punishment (the magistrate and the officer that pulled him over both recommended house arrest and said we should have no trouble getting it. But here in pa it has to be sent up to an intermediate punishment hearing which is determined by an actual judge. Aka higher up than magistrate). And the judge denied his petition for house arrest. So yeah. He's in jail for 60 days. 48 left to go. He shouldn't have been driving, and I know he has to deal with the consequences of that I'm not trying to make excuses for him or anything, but for gods sake he never even get to hold his daughter and now if something happens to his son (we lost Peyton at 25 weeks and he will be in jail for that point in this pregnancy) he will miss his only chance to meet him too. This pregnancy has been nothing but complications, I'm on bedrest and dealing with placenta previa, notching on my left uterine artery, a calcium deposit on the baby's heart, unexplained symptoms of super early pre e (high liver enzymes, low mpv, signs of moderate kidney disease, etc.) That theyre still running tests for (hoping it's cholestasis), etc. The notching is raising my blood pressure and developing into hypertension which the doctor strongly believes is going to turn into pre e later in the pregnancy if I don't have it already, and I'm not even getting into the rest of the stuff that's gone wrong you get the point. \n\nOn top of everything, there's a good chance he is going to lose his job. And since I'm on bed rest we have zero income right now. Closest family lives 2 hours away (we just moved here in March and literally know no-one). So it's just me and the dog and a stack of bills until the beginning of July. It caught us totally off gaurd.. The magistrate and the officer made it sound like the chance of him not getting house arrest was basically nonexsistant. Of course the cocky lawyer told us not to worry that we definitely were getting house arrest.. He never even hinted that we should prepare for things to go bad. Of course we did anyway but deep down we didn't think it would actually happen. But it is what it is and I just lost my main/only support for the next two months (not counting you all of course). I'm sure you guys can understand why I haven't been more open about this all in the past. It's embarrassing and awkward and I know a lot of people don't have sympathy because of the legal issues. But it's my reality right now. \n\nThank you guys for letting me vent. I know I haven't been around much recently and well, that's why. The baby seems to be doing good, my next appointment isn't until the 25th but his movement's get stronger and more consistent every day. I've been able to feel him since 16 weeks and at this point I feel his movement's much more and much stronger than I ever felt my daughter. I take that as a good sign.

So at least I have that going for me. I'm in pa and I wouldn't qualify for diability and because I don't have any living children I don't qualify for welfare or anything like that. I'm not entirely sure how it all works to be honest. But nothing happens very quick do by the time I got my application in it would probably take at least a month to process it and by the time it all goes through he will be out anyway (if id even qualify). Really I just have to get through one more month of rent/utilities and then I'll be alright. We have been on a crazy bad luck run..My car needs a new shifting cable and clutch (my first stick lol) so I'd been driving my husbands truck and of course the day after he went in the damn thing overheated on me and turns out it needed a new head gasket. So for the first week I was stranded out here with no car either but it's back up and running. I'm just feeling extremely overwhelmed and when I told my parents what happened (they knew what was going on but like us they didn't think they would actually send him to jail over it) my mom lost her shit. She's worried about me being alone in a town where I don't know anyone and about my financial situation, but her idea of dealing with it is for me to move in with her and my step dad until he gets out then finding somewhere closer to home. To do that I would need to get rid of my dog, put all my stuff in storage, break my lease and risk being sued, live with my abusive step father while pregnant, and she isn't ok with dh moving in when he gets out so he would go...where? His mothers two hours away when we have the baby coming? It's just a totally insane idea. Then she expects us to find a place and move in while I'm literally weeks from my due date (I'm being induced at 37w). That's all assuming he doesnt lose his job. If he does, then what? It makes more sense for me to just stick it out for a month and a half. Money will be tight and some bill's might be late but it is nothing that can't be caught up on. I understand she's worried about me being along with the medical stuff going on (and she isn't in a position to help financially), but for gods sake woman it's temporary.\n\nI'm not sure if you saw this before but dh had been laid off for some time and had actually just got back to work recently, so we were still dealing with the financial fall out from him being laid off after the company he was working for went belly up (which is why my mom's so concerned about money issues right now which I definitely understand). We keep getting blind sided by these huge life altering things and at the worst possible time. Before losing Peyton (which seems to be the beginning of the bad luck)  last year at this time I wouldve described our financial situation as very comfortable. And now neither of us are working and I'm struggling to cover a month of rent. If I would have known things were going to end up like this only a year later, I don't know if we would have tried to get pregnant right after losing Peyton. It isn't fair to the baby to bring him into this right now when things are such a mess and so uncertain. I just don't know what to do. I'm sure it'll work out it just seems so impossible right now.

I underwent 2 rounds of misoprostel with no complications. I'm lucky enough to have a great OB that recommended we go see a fertility specialist. I had no expectations and when we met with the specialist it was amazing. He did not brush off all of my chemical pregnancies and miscarriages and he did not try to push meds the first appointment. He understood my history and offered detailed explanations as to why I have recurrent miscarriages. He put me and my husband on a strict diet and I have labs and a procedure this month that will rule out anything like endometriosis (I doubt I have it but we are being thorough). Its been a week since we started the diet and I have to admit I feel great. I think I'll put up a post about our fertility experience tomorrow. Its too much to talk about all at once. I hope you ladies know that I'm thinking about you and my heart breaks for all your loss. My little baby girl would have been born 2 weeks ago today.

I'm so glad that my body is finally back to normal. It took so long for everything to be cleared out. I didn't even realise I still felt pregnant until suddenly a couple of weeks ago I didn't. I don't want to think about all this, I hate that it's suddenly at the front of my brain again.

Baby was active and has a nasal bone.  The technician didn't comment on the nuchal translucency measurements, but we saw the numbers and they are fairly high: between 0.25 and 0.34 cm.  A few dark hours followed, then we pieced together a picture that even if the scan + blood test come back with a high risk result, it's more likely to be a false positive than a true positive.  We're getting the Harmony test later this week anyway, and if we need it there's amnio after that.  \n\n\nOn a different note - my boss has been away for a couple of weeks as we're having a team lunch in a couple of days.  It's at a funky new Asian restaurant run by one of the country's top chefs.  Ordinarily I'd be really excited, but right now my nausea + pregnancy food rules mean that most of the menu isn't going to work for me.  There are worse problems to have, but it's going to be a bit of a challenge.
