Every time I see someone complaining on Facebook about morning sickness, or having a sore back in their 3rd trimester, or being tired because of their newborn, or whatever pregnancy/baby complaint it is, I want to strangle them through the computer. Or just tell them that they have no idea how lucky they are.
