I don't know your financial situation, but could you look into temporarily switching insurance? Maybe find a decent plan on the ACA marketplace, then get a work-up done through a non-Kaiser doc. If they can give you a diagnosis, then if and when you switch back to Kaiser, they would be \"justified\" in whatever treatment plan is appropriate.

So interesting. I had a similar experience: cautioning my spouse; being skeptical of my OB's optimism even while everything looked fine; delaying announcing the pregnancy until the 12 week scan, and then until the NIPT results came back, and then until I had to start wearing maternity pants at 16 weeks, and even then only telling people who I saw day-to-day; willing myself to get out of bed on the morning of the 20 week anatomy scan because I was (irrationally, I thought) terrified.\n\nWhen I mentioned this to my therapist, she told me about all this research that shows that people's \"self-assessment\" of their health -- basically, like, just their gut feelings -- are shockingly reliable, even when there's no known evidence of disease. Knowing this, in retrospect, I wonder if there was some body-to-brain communication that was feeding my simmering unease about my pregnancy.\n\nI *also* feel like, with everything that has happened, if I am ever pregnant again I will be in full-on panic mode no matter what. I wonder if a future pregnancy will ever feel \"normal.\" I wonder if even a live birth would put an end to my worrying (all kinds of things can go wrong with babies!).
