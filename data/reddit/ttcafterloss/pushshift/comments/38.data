I'm posting from bed because I'm scared to go to the toilet. Next appointment is Monday- not soon enough!\n\n2. My cervix. At what point do I address my concerns with this to my doctor? I've had a colposcopy and LEEP and the research seems mixed on implications for future pregnancies. My grandma also had an incompetent cervix, leading to several miscarriages and all of her children were born prematurely, even the ones where she had a cerclage. This concerns me.\n\n3. Random but how far in should I be shoving my vaginal progesterone suppositories? The office doesn't give clear guidance. Some days I can get the applicator all the way in and other days it only goes half to 3/4 in. Am I going too far? Not far enough?
