I've said those exact words to countless people in my life. I caution you, though, on setting up that kind of expectation. \n\nBabies are not necessarily easy to make. You've got youth on your side, but many people who find it easy to become pregnant the first time aren't necessarily guaranteed an easy conception the second time. Setting up the expectation that you can't possibly heal without becoming pregnant again places responsibility for your wellness on a process that is as much chance as science. What if it takes a year? What if you lose another one? Or what if, despite everything, you become pregnant and still feel grieved?\n\nWhatever you decide regarding trying for another baby, I suggest you work on your grief as a separate issue. The passage of time is one thing: I found the changing of the seasons to be really instrumental in my feeling \"unstuck\" in the worst year of my life. You may also find engaging in cathartic activities (art, exercise, writing, etc) to be helpful. Going to therapy or support groups is a common way of working on grief as well. \n\nI'm not trying to dissuade you from trying for a baby. I just think you're falling into the really common trap of early grief, thinking that a baby is the answer to your sorrow. Losing a baby caused it, so having a baby will fix it. In reality, that's non sequitur logic. And besides, a baby doesn't need that kind of pressure. A baby needs a family that wants *him,* and is ready to face the challenges that life with a child will present.

Cons: catheter if you get the epidural, pain if you don't, and may have a c-section anyway if it doesn't work. If you're induced right after, it may take a bit to get labor going but they can turn off the epidural and let you move around once it's done. However, I'm still glad I did it because at least we tried. And my c-section had nothing to do with her being breech. I just didn't progress.
