Then she left to get the doctor and I looked over at the machine - THIS BITCH HAD THE VOLUME SET AT ZERO. Are you kidding me? My doctor came in and I said \"uhh, I think the volume is turned off\" and he turned it up and found the heartbeat immediately. Jesus Christ. I did not need that. \n\nAnyway - then Jack failed the NST *again* - he didn't get enough heart accelerations. My doctor did an ultrasound and he passed that with flying colors (practicing breathing, moving arms and legs, good fluid) - so he said the NST is only one part of the overall picture, and overall that gives the baby an 8/10 score and he felt comfortable sending me home. However I have to go back on Wednesday and Friday for NSTs and ultrasounds because of it. My induction is still set for October 7 but I really wouldn't be surprised if I get induced sooner if Jack keeps trolling. \n\nI am sooooo done. \n\nEdit: Oh, and I got more info on how my doc does the induction process. If I'm not dilated/effaced enough at my appointment next Monday, I'll have Cervadil placed when I get to the hospital (7:30am Wednesday). I guess it's like a tampon with prostaglandin gel on it. They'll leave that in for about 12 hours to soften my cervix. He said that's enough to trigger labor in 5% of patients, so it may not work. If it doesn't, they'll let me sleep all Wednesday night without anything and start Pitocin Thursday morning. If I *am* dilated/effaced at my appointment next week, I'll just go straight to Pitocin on Wednesday. This is a bit different than my induction with Oliver because I had Cyotec and no break between that and labor (can't remember if I had Pitocin or not).", "controversiality": 0, "created_utc": 1443490881, "distinguished": null, "edited": 1443492111, "gilded": 0, "id": "cvhlxfs", "link_id": "t3_3mo7oi", "nest_level": 1, "parent_id": "t3_3mo7oi", "reply_delay": 67085, "retrieved_on": 1444641156, "score": 3, "subreddit": "ttcafterloss", "subreddit_id": "t5_34scd"}, {"author": "SansaScully", "author_created_utc": 1406227887, "author_flair_css_class": "", "author_flair_text": "Moderator - TFMR 8/14", "author_fullname": "t2_hk1cj", "body": "My SIL gives me shit every time she sees me drink a diet soda, it's so annoying!
