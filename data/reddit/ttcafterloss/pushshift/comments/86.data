We are really hoping to conceive again in the next 6 months. \n\nI've been pretty surprised by my optimism. I think the biggest source of my hope is that obviously I am capable of growing a healthy living baby. I was so afraid that it wasn't possible for me when we were last TTC. We had one specialist tell us it wasn't possible and even though four others disagreed, it stuck with me and I was so afraid she was right.\n\nMy pregnancy with our surviving daughter was the first where we tried lovenox, so I am also hopeful that we have found our problem and know how to fix it. We recently met with a new OB (we moved away from my last OB, who we loved) and will be meeting with a new MFM soon to get a plan in place. Knowing that I will have a prescription for lovenox at the pharmacy just waiting to be filled is a huge weight off my mind.\n\nI know life doesn't come with guarantees and I am sure I will be fearful after I get a positive test. When we met with the new doctor I also asked about extra monitoring and ultrasounds, how they handle losses, etc. Realistically, I think we will likely experience at least one more loss - we'd love to have 4 living kids, so the stats are not in our favor even if our risk is \"normal\" once I'm taking lovenox. I am really hoping that any future losses will be early though. I think I could handle it if we had a few chemical pregnancies in between healthy pregnancies, but I can't imagine another 2nd trimester loss. But then after every loss I've said I couldn't imagine surviving another one, and here I am...\n\nHave you found any good resources for TTC after a successful pregnancy after loss?

I had four losses before the diagnosis and one more since then. \n\nIt\u2019s especially shitty because doctors don\u2019t seem to know as much about this condition and how it relates to infertility because it was previously associated with older women with multiple children, go figure. \n\nThe plan we made with our RE is to continue ttc at home and use 400mg of progesterone/day starting 3dpo. I\u2019ve also been on an anti-inflammatory diet (no dairy, gluten, refined sugar, caffeine, alcohol, or fried foods) and have been avoiding additional estrogens (soy, non-organic meats, certain beauty products) as adeno is an estrogen-fed condition. \n\nMy RE thinks the best chance of bringing a baby home is IVF with PGS and several months of down-regulating with Lupron before transfer. Lupron will block estrogen production and essentially induce menopause which in theory will settle down the adeno inflammation, giving us a better chance of a healthy pregnancy. \n\nI don\u2019t want to jump right in to IVF because it\u2019s still too daunting to me and I\u2019d rather exhaust all other options first, even if it means more losses. \n\nHere are some articles I found that may interest you: \n\n[The impact of adenomyosis on women\u2019s fertility ](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5049976/) \n\n[pregnancy rate in women with adeno following GnRH-a treatment ](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5039310/#__sec5title) \n\n[recent advances in understanding and managing adenomyosis ](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6419978/) \n\nBest wishes!", "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "created_utc": 1575029353, "gildings": {}, "id": "f92fzrb", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_e2y7zy", "locked": false, "no_follow": true, "parent_id": "t3_e2y7zy", "permalink": "/r/ttcafterloss/comments/e2y7zy/does_anyone_have_adenomyosis/f92fzrb/", "retrieved_on": 1575029353, "score": 1, "send_replies": true, "steward_reports": [], "stickied": false, "subreddit": "ttcafterloss", "subreddit_id": "t5_34scd", "total_awards_received": 0}, {"all_awardings": [], "associated_award": null, "author": "mostlyminischnauzer", "author_flair_background_color": null, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_template_id": null, "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_4jrpxerk", "author_patreon_flair": false, "awarders": [], "body": "Im so sorry you're going through this and not having the kind of support you want.", "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "created_utc": 1575034547, "gildings": {}, "id": "f92k8ao", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_e3egbw", "locked": false, "no_follow": true, "parent_id": "t3_e3egbw", "permalink": "/r/ttcafterloss/comments/e3egbw/stop_telling_me_to_go_to_therapy/f92k8ao/", "retrieved_on": 1575034547, "score": 1, "send_replies": true, "steward_reports": [], "stickied": false, "subreddit": "ttcafterloss", "subreddit_id": "t5_34scd", "total_awards_received": 0}, {"all_awardings": [], "associated_award": null, "author": "imisswine", "author_flair_background_color": null, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_template_id": "ce4ab51a-711f-11e4-826c-12313d148545", "author_flair_text": "35 | TFMR @ 20+1 | TTC #1", "author_flair_text_color": "dark", "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_3d4qpg4i", "author_patreon_flair": false, "awarders": [], "body": "Oh, I\u2019m so sorry for what you\u2019ve been through.\n\nI hope you\u2019re getting the mental health help you need.

I believe my reaction to getting pregnant after loss would definitely depend on the timing of my MC - if I lost a baby at 18 weeks, I\u2019m positive that I would feel differently (not sure precisely how, but differently). I also never saw a heartbeat with my miscarriage, so it was over as soon as it started. It kind of left me stunned. \n\nWhen i received the positive news at 6w5d, I knew it was going to be a different experience this time around. It is very weird for me. I feared a lot, but I didn\u2019t fear the things that really happened. I feared miscarriage but instead got hit with a whack of very rare pregnancy complications that have flipped my life upside down for 6 months! I guess you never really know what pregnancy will bring, both good and  bad. \n\nMy doctors reminded me one miscarriage is not predictive of future miscarriages, so I kept that in the front of my mind for weeks.

I can't imagine if I had come there closer to when I found out we'd lost our baby or the days after. I am also 100% fine around babies, around baby stuff... It's all okay if I am prepared for it but I can't be blindsided when I'm trying to focus on something else. I have gone out after my losses to move on and tried to make good memories after any hard event but I've never seen a sign that was as painful in the moment as this. 1/4 of pregnancies end in miscarriage. Some women can't get pregnant. Some are broke as hell picking up weekend shifts to cover a meal out with family who's in town and had to terminate because of financial issues. Some are dealing with incessant nagging by family if they don't want to be mothers. Some mothers kids are grown and move away and they miss them being in their lives daily. Some kids are estranged from their mothers because of BPD or other issues that make the relationship complicated and painful. If you're causing 1/3 of your restroom visitors to be annoyed or hurt maybe put up a painting or something you know? Something with a little less bittersweetness. If it would have been a kid on a beach with Mom, no worries, but this language just seems like twisting a knife in a sore wound. \n\nI realized I am being sensitive, which is why I didn't cause a scene or anything in the moment... But this sign is trying to pull at the heartstrings of a very specific demographic, and doesn't seem in line with a public restroom that caters to many diverse populations. Gift for your mom, or at someone's baby shower? Great! Put that shit up in her bathroom! But at a place where you might go for a mimosa with your girlfriend after a miscarriage? I think it's worth bringing it to their attention.
