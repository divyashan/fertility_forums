My RE explained that they will do a whole battery of bloodwork, but only six weeks after my beta hcg returns to zero - she said a lot of the tests can be thrown off with residual beta hcg and it's paramount to wait to get accurate results. She said they plan on doing extensive thyroid testing on me because she said my thyroid felt large, but also noted that thyroid hormones drastically change during pregnancy so again I have to wait. It sucks. As of last Monday, which was two weeks after my bleeding started, my beta was still 56 - and this was even after an ultrasound the week before at my old OBs office to make sure my uterus was empty (they said it was - but my beta is still up). So I'm going back in next week hoping it goes down to zero. Anyway, I know it's frustrating, all this waiting, when all you want to do is jump back in to trying again. So you're not alone there with the impatience. \n\nHugs and lots of love.

I have been feeling just so fucking depressed, and it's been making me feel so isolated. That massive falling out with my mom isn't helping, and I feel like my wallowing has been wearing thin on my husband. When I'm pissy and grouchy I tend to pick little arguments, which drives him nuts, then I get all sad and mopey, and want my husband to be sweet and supportive, which he's having none of. It just all gets so messy. I know it all comes back down to just being open and talking, but it's not that easy in the thick of daily life. \n\nAnyway, I had an absolute emotional meltdown yesterday, and was just so fed up with everything. I really toyed with the idea of stopping this whole TTC madness and just being happy with my 2.5 year old son. I got really upset over how much I took my pregnancy with him for granted. An unplanned pregnancy and being unmarried was really fucking terrifying, I was so scared I wasn't ready to be a mom, scared it would drive a wedge between me and my then-boyfriend (now husband). I mean, at the beginning when I first found out, I had to seriously consider the idea of an abort!on because it was so unexpected. I'm lucky that my husband never pressured me, never made me feel obligated in any way. But it was a terrifying time. I can say now in hindsight that I wasn't excited for my son being born because I was so fucking scared of the uncertainty. I'm so incredibly lucky because it wound up being the best thing in the world for me and my husband, we both talk about it at length that its exactly what we needed and never knew we wanted. And I don't worry that it threw us into some sort of obligation to be together. I knew he and I would be together whether we ever had kids or not. It just, changed the story a bit, and thats okay. But I know in my heart it's what I wanted, now that I look back at it all.\n\nAnd now, here we are, trying to make the educated decision to have another child, and I keep fucking failing at it. I mean, isn't it so disgustingly ironic? Now that I actually *want* this, I have to face all this bullshit? It just made me wonder, is it worth all this drama? I mean, I know there are a lot of other factors at play here (my husband's horrible job, family drama, my job search, finances, etc), but things really fucking suck right now. Would it be easier to remove the whole TTC/miscarrying thing from the table? I honestly don't even know. I *want* to try. My husband has made no comment about stopping or that maybe we shouldn't keep going. I'm wondering this on my own. I just don't know. It just feels like my whole pregnancy with my son was some distant dream, like did it really happen? Was I really pregnant? I was so *scared* then, but never once thought something could happen to him - I was scared for me, scared for the change it would bring.\n\nAnyway, sorry for all the word vomit. I'm not sure where to go from here. I think I have it in me one last time to try. I haven't really shared these feelings with my husband, he's just kind of done with my emotional volatility I think. We kind of talked yesterday (well, I cried at him while he stared at me), I told him how it seems he goes from the most supportive person in the universe in the midst of a crisis, but when *he* is done dealing with it, then that means his support is kind of dried up, too. He agreed he needs to be better balanced about it because he said he doesn't expect me to be done grieving or being upset. He's just a very diplomatic \"pull yourself up by the bootstraps\" kind of person, when shit needs to get done then theres no time for crying. He's had a very emotionally rough childhood thanks to his batshit crazy mother, so I know he has a lot of skeletons there that, honestly, he doesn't want to tackle. The same way that I can be emotionally needy, he an be emotionally stunted. We're just products of what we've been through. None of this is new to us. \nAnyway. \n\nThanks for just letting me get all of this out. Sorry for being so long-winded. If you read all of that, well, then you might be just as crazy as me.

This is what I wrote:\n\n\nSURPRISE! I'm pregnant. And terrified. And elated. And anxious. And excited. And nervous. And sad. And happy.\n\nNot gonna lie, being pregnant after a loss, especially a relatively late loss, is the hardest thing I've ever willingly put myself through. I was of two minds whether to even share whether that we're expecting again, and I've kept this news close to my heart for months now. But when it comes down to it, even if this baby ends up being in heaven with Isaac, I would want you all to know that this baby is part of our family. Oh, and why I've dropped off the face of the planet lately. (Well, when you spend most of your spare time sleeping....)\n\nIf I could ask one thing, it would be that you don't say that you \"know it will all work out\" or that you are \"sure things will end differently this time\" or that you \"have a good feeling about this one.\" The truth is, we just don't know. This pregnancy is definitely high-risk. That's not necessarily a bad thing. It means I regularly see a high-risk obstetrician in addition to my regular OB, I get all the pretty pictures of baby that I want, and altogether I'm being monitored very closely this time around. But there are some things that we are looking out for and some goals we want to meet before baby makes an appearance, and there have been a couple speedbumps along the way. All we can do is take one day at a time and hope for the absolute best.\n\nSo please hope, wish and pray for the best with us.
