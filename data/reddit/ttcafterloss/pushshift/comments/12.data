When I get upset or emotional I get diarrhea of the mouth and it makes my anxiety ten times worse because then I replay everything I said over and over again and analyze what other people said or didn't say to see if they think I'm nuts. \n\nExample: I was out of school Friday, and again today. I HATE being out of school, because like I said, I feel like I'm letting my colleagues and students down, even though rationally, I know I'm not. I went to the school this AM to get together all the materials I prepared last week so everything would be ready for the sub. As I was leaving, I saw the principal. I meant to just ask if I could talk to her tomorrow. As soon as I said that I started crying a little and apologized. I told her I hate being out, especially the days before and after a holiday, because it looks like I'm taking off to be on vacation. She kind of smiled like I was nuts and said \"no one mentioned anything about you being on a vacation.\" I know that, but my mind still convinces me that I look like a total piece of crap for being out. I told her I know, but I feel like it looks very convenient for me to be sick the two days around a holiday and it just makes me feel bad that I have to be out. She just smiled again and said she'd see me when I got back tomorrow. As soon as I left I was like wtf, mouth! The plan was to just ask to talk and then that's it. Now I'm second guessing everything I said and thinking she must think she's employing a crazy person. \n\nI just feel the need to justify my actions when I'm not able to do my job, and I really shouldn't, because I'm entitled to these sick days. And me trying to justify my absences just makes me look crazy. Or it makes me feel like I look crazy. \n\nToday I have the ultrasound and follow up with my OB. The ultrasound is for the cyst which I don't really care about right now, I just want to talk to the OB to hear what she thinks we can do when we decide to try again. Hopefully she won't brush me off.

My husband helped me unearth some very heavy emotions from abuse from my mother growing up.. I have struggled with weight my entire life.. Not the \"last ten pounds\" kind.. The 50+ more too loose kind... I have been depressed since losing Lucas, but since we started therapy it seems three depression got worse..  My husband asked just the right questions this weekend when i was down to have an awakening that my weight was caused by mental abuse my mother has caused me over my life time.. And she used my weight as a control to keep me submissive...  All of this \"awakening\" was overwhelming.. Like the pieces off a puzzle falling into place spelling out your entire relationship with your mother was a manipulative narcissistic lie..  \n\nI have a list of horrible things she would say to me.. Primarily after her divorce but even before then to.. For instance, when i was 12 my mother had me at a doctor's office telling me i would never have children because i was misdiagnosed with pcos (no pcos, no high glucose, no high testosterone, nada).. I doubt i even was diagnosed with it.. But because my cycles were long she said i had pcos.. (35 day cycles isn't unheard of)..  So here i was 12 years old being told i would never have children...  \n\nAt 21 my dad left (who could blame him) but she told me she was glad i was fat so my dad wouldn't molest me.. (Never in his life would he do such a horrific thing... Think of him like a young Andy Griffith).. So them Not only did i feel unloved but also undesirable, who would want a fat ugly girl.. I felt unlovable.. I couldn't even love myself..\n\n\nThat's sadly the tip of the iceberg... And that's what i was facing this weekend... Lots of thinking. Lots of crying. More thinking, more crying...\n\nI put my foot down yesterday that I'm taking my life back.. That the abuse isn't going to control me any more..  The weight is coming off, along with the mental abuse.. I havnt spoken to her since Lucas died.. And i don't think i will...
