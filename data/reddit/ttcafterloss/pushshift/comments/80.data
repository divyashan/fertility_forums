My doctor called me back to tell me the results and discuss my upcoming D&amp;C. I had previously asked if they could test the tissue to determine the cause. She told me that in answer to my question they could give me the tissue to take home and would take a sample for pathology if something indicated a reason to do so. Which wasn't what I had asked.... but now I'm wondering what to do with the tissue. I suppose I'll bury in the back yard. \n\nHas anyone else buried their early losses? Mine was very young.

It helped me to take the time to get back to an exercise regimen that was at first really easy activities: walking, short bouts of cycling etc. Mostly I paid extra special attention to being kind to myself. This is not the time to push yourself but to give to yourself. Maybe set an hour aside daily to listen to a guided meditation, or take a walk or do whatever else you like. But the rule is: you can't judge yourself for not doing more.\n Then the next week just watch yoga videos and maybe try to do a couple of asanas if you feel like it. Don't set any result-oriented goals but process-oriented goals. Basically just do something and be as kind as you can to yourself while doing it. Our bodies need our love more than anything especially at a times like these and no matter what state they are in.
