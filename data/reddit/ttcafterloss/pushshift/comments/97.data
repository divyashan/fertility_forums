Genetic testing showed that she had a gene mutation and an extra X chromosome - the gene mutation is a possible fluke and is what likely caused her kidney issue and other anomalies she had. \n\nMy follow-up post TFMR hasn't been great either (Canada) and I've had to _really_ advocate for myself to get the appointments and information needed, especially now during COVID. I would ask your doctor or OB for blood work and more information as to what you can do to prepare for another pregnancy and have the best outcome. See if they can recommend brands to buy for vitamins/supplements and if there is any testing you can have done.\n\nWith that being said, with our TFMR I have to take into account the fact that her gene mutation was probably a fluke and nothing I could've done would've changed the outcome. I had one previous pregnancy which resulted in a healthy daughter with no complications and I did nothing to prepare for her - she was an accident. I was smoking cannabis, drinking, drinking a _ton_ of coffee and taking no supplements.\n\nRight now I'm taking my Kirkland brand prenatals (thanks Costco!), my iron, and vit D3 plus making sure I'm eating well and exercising. I'm trying not to stress or to think too much about getting pregnant though we're trying. I still drink my coffee and have foods/drinks I'll need to avoid when pregnant.\n\nTo ease my mind with my next pregnancy (fingers crossed) I will be having more scans which, because of our TFMR, we can ask for and receive. I'm highly considering an amniocentesis instead of an NIPT since our last NIPT didn't catch the extra chromosome with our daughter which I feel would've helped us catch her anatomy issues earlier. My husband and I will be getting genetic blood work soon too to see if there are any issues we should look out for in regards to pregnancy. \n\nGood luck to you.

However, I feel like in this situation, my personal take is that friends who are pregnant/have kids can and should make a little more effort if they know you are struggling, and here\u2019s why. There still seems to be a stigma around infertility, and even if there weren\u2019t, for many people it is still a private thing that people might not feel comfortable blasting all over the place. There is not a ton of in real life support for infertility. If you tell someone that means you are comfortable with them and trust them. People tend to not know what to say or say insensitive things when you talk about infertility and losses. But very few people are going to tell a pregnant person or a mom to stop talking about her pregnancy and kids. And as you said this friend of yours has a bunch of other friends who are pregnant or new moms, so why should you, someone who is struggling with loss that she knows about, have to be a sounding board for her pregnancy issues? It isn\u2019t that those issues aren\u2019t valid- but you shouldn\u2019t have to be the person she goes to for them unless you told her you were ok with being that person. \nI have a couple of friendships that have changed a bit due to this but I also think that\u2019s the nature of a lot of friendships once someone has kids and other people don\u2019t. I really think once a lot of people have kids they are just so involved/their lives have changed so much that they can\u2019t imagine that other people wouldn\u2019t want to hear about/see their kids all the time. It can be annoying but usually I minimize contact with those people and spend more time with other people without kids or people with kids who don\u2019t focus on them all the time. I don\u2019t feel bad. If I have bought gifts for your kid and oohed and ahhed at pics of them etc and been supportive of you and now you can\u2019t have the sensitivity to not shove them in my face nonstop when you know I am struggling then that\u2019s on you, not me. I will continue to be as good of a friend as I have the strength to be and I will never lash out at anyone because they have kids/are pregnant and I am not, but I\u2019m not going to make myself suffer anymore than I already have to. \nLots of love to you and I hope things work out for you soon. \u2764\ufe0f", "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "created_utc": 1594738116, "gildings": {}, "id": "fy1hfd2", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_hqt6s5", "locked": false, "no_follow": true, "parent_id": "t3_hqt6s5", "permalink": "/r/ttcafterloss/comments/hqt6s5/maintaining_strong_friendships_with_pregnant/fy1hfd2/", "retrieved_on": 1594759809, "score": 2, "send_replies": true, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "ttcafterloss", "subreddit_id": "t5_34scd", "top_awarded_type": null, "total_awards_received": 0, "treatment_tags": []}, {"all_awardings": [], "associated_award": null, "author": "bookworm72", "author_flair_background_color": null, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_template_id": null, "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_10p65h", "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_premium": false, "awarders": [], "body": "I think that\u2019s awesome that your sister is so understanding!

It was a little reassuring though to hear that my two cousins had each had two MCs and went on to have children, as well as my mother and aunt each having one.\n\nBut then today my new gynecologist (I recently moved) was just full of information that I already had, and was trying to tell me when I should ovulate based on how long my cycle is when I'm doing BBT and OPKs and people don't always ovulate on the same CD... At least she said my cervix looked good after the LEEP, but now I have to wait two weeks for the results. Fingers crossed no more CIN2!\n\nI have a trial subscription to Kindle Unlimited, and I was looking for pregnancy books. Unfortunately, there aren't many with good ratings available, but on a whim I downloaded one called \"Am I The Reason I'm Not Getting Pregnant?\" and started reading it. It's kind of cheesy/BS, but it's helping me to reevaluate some of my negative feelings. If the statistics say that 80% of women who've had a LEEP have no issues carrying a child to term, why am I so worried about being an outlier? Just because I've had one MC doesn't mean I will have another. My anxiety about all of this is borrowing trouble for me.

We had been TTC for about 6 months so I had been used to tracking the dates, did not do any OPKs as I felt I was pretty regular.\n\nMy second cycle following MC was deceptively normal at 29 days, but the following one was 36 days (leading to lots of anxiety about being pregnant, but only negative tests). My period was relatively short 3 to 4 days and heavy for those cycles. Currently I am on CD 32 and getting negative tests, so I am now wondering if my cycle has changed completely. \n\nI have begun using LH strips and tracking for these past cycles. I seemed to have a spike around days 14-15, but the past cycle I also noticed an increase later in my cycle day 22-23. I've been having trouble temp tracking as well because I do shift work, and end up doing 50% nights so I'm almost never consistently waking at the same time.\n\nLong story short, I think I will take time for my cycles to normalize which is of course so frustrating!", "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "created_utc": 1594756444, "gildings": {}, "id": "fy2jf16", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_hr11xp", "locked": false, "no_follow": true, "parent_id": "t3_hr11xp", "permalink": "/r/ttcafterloss/comments/hr11xp/tw_cycles_after_loss/fy2jf16/", "retrieved_on": 1594781112, "score": 2, "send_replies": true, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "ttcafterloss", "subreddit_id": "t5_34scd", "top_awarded_type": null, "total_awards_received": 0, "treatment_tags": []}, {"all_awardings": [], "associated_award": null, "author": "ShanLanHen", "author_flair_background_color": null, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_template_id": null, "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_3n73t6p5", "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_premium": true, "awarders": [], "body": "We can only hope that it will be.
