You should use the word died, and explain dying simply. Their body no longer works, they don't feel pain, or need to eat or sleep. Baby is not in mummy's tummy anymore.

And also bringing it up unprompted, for example if they see you cry. Explain why you are sad. These ones are hard, because their grief comes in short bursts. They will say a couple of things, or ask questions, and then want to play again, and you are shattered.\n\nWith regards to trying again, I have no advice.

I am over 2 years out from my loss and seemed to have a very different reaction to most people whose stories I have read on here. I lost my son at 21 weeks as well, after about 4 weeks of uncertainty, lots of bleeding and being in and out of the hospital. My living son was 3, nearly 4 at the time, and was so excited to meet his little brother - a ton of his friends at daycare were also about to have siblings around the same time. We were honest with him, and tried to use the word \"died\" as much as possible rather than \"passed away\" or \"got sick\" - i was advised by my midwife that talking about sickness surrounding pregnancy loss can be tough for living kids, because they can latch on to the idea that sick = death. For us, my son definitely associated the hospital with death, and he had to have surgery for something minor about 6 months after I lost my Rhys and he was TERRIFIED. Its getting better now. He still talks about him all the time and we kind of love it when he does - Rhys will always be part of our family. We bought a flowering bush in his memory and we all take care of it together and decorate it at christmas. \n\nIn terms of trying again, as I said I'm over two years out and still on the fence. I went on the pill for the first year after losing Rhys because I couldn't cope with the idea of being pregnant again. Then I had some marital troubles that are pretty much resolved, but that's given me extra anxiety around trying. Now I'm making peace with being a family of 3 while still not actively trying or preventing, and we'll see what happens. I definitely didn't have the intense need to be pregnant again which a lot of people seem to have. Everyone is different, just do what feels right for your family. \n\nAgain, I'm so sorry for your loss x", "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "created_utc": 1592958306, "gildings": {}, "id": "fvsusdf", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_hefchc", "locked": false, "no_follow": true, "parent_id": "t3_hefchc", "permalink": "/r/ttcafterloss/comments/hefchc/loss_at_21_weeks_on_june_3_when_are_you_mentally/fvsusdf/", "retrieved_on": 1592962574, "score": 1, "send_replies": true, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "ttcafterloss", "subreddit_id": "t5_34scd", "top_awarded_type": null, "total_awards_received": 0, "treatment_tags": []}, {"all_awardings": [], "associated_award": null, "author": "Plazmotic", "author_flair_background_color": null, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_template_id": "8b677c92-711f-11e4-b63c-12313b0b807d", "author_flair_text": "39, 2MCs, 1CP, 1LC, 1TFMR", "author_flair_text_color": "dark", "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_1faq9uk0", "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_premium": false, "awarders": [], "body": "Hey, another TFMR over here (18 weeks for me).

During our consult last week you told me I didn't have to do hormonal labs again. You didn't tell me in advance that I would have to spring for a $1,000 genetics test. Oh and this is all to prep for IVF, which we hadn't agreed was a next step.\n\nThen the ultrasound. The last time I saw an ultrasound was when we miscarried last time. It sucked not having my husband there. The good news: AFC was good! The not good news: my lining is thin, 5.6 mm, 1DPO. \n\nThe doctor had told me that we would go over results the next day in our consult (and my husband would be there). But instead I was half naked on a table by myself learning that my lining was thin. 3 minutes and $225 later I was ready to GTFO. \n\nI cried on the way home. My husband: \"But now we know--and now we can do something about it.\" True. But then I thought about my doctor who ordered the original labs and asked me if I was \\*sure\\* I did my labs when she told me to, because my estrogen was low. And then I thought about a few weeks ago when I revisited those labs and emailed my RN about the low estradiol levels. \"They're fine.\" Well guess what, Alice. They're not fine and it's probably played a role in us not getting pregnant. Fuck you very much. \n\nWhy is the medical community so against advocating for and supporting women? Why didn't my OB tell me we should do an ultrasound so we could check my lining months ago? Why didn't my RN listen to me? Instead, we've been trying and trying and nothing since our \\*second\\* miscarriage in February.
