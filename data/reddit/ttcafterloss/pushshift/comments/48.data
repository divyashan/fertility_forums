I will preface this answer by saying that I have a history of anxiety so things may be different for me, but here's the entirely honest answer: I still don't. I hope that instead of freaking you out it helps if 1) you get to a place that I never did or 2) you feel less alone if like me you never get to that place either. \n\nI was a *hot mess* my first trimester. Thankfully I was under the care of an amazing RE who let me come in for weekly scans. I cried and panicked before each one. Like tears the night before and more tears while waiting for her to come in with the wand. Each time I got a renewed sense of hope and \"holy shit, this is still happening.\" My goal was to not stress about things more than 20% of the time, but to allow myself to be anxious when I was. Giving myself that space really helped. My husband shared a lot of the same worry, and it was helpful to talk to him about mine. He also never judged me for freaking out/crying hysterically, which really helped. \n\nI thought things might get better in the second trimester, but more worry came instead. There will be a point where your first trimester symptoms go away but you can't yet feel movement. Holy hell that was hard for me. Buying a doppler helped, and I tried to limit my use to once a week. At this point I was only going to the OB monthly (because somehow I graduated from an amazing RE who treated me like a fucking special snowflake (lol) to an OB where I was just a Plain Jane with a normal, boring pregnancy). The dropoff in appointments coupled with the lack of symptoms and movement was a really hard place to be in. Things that helped: talking to my husband, using the doppler occasionally, having the NT ultrasound spaced out so it was 2 weeks between my 4 week OB appointment, and getting the NIPT - extra confirmation that things were OK at least from a chromosome standpoint (I've had losses due to chromosomes so this helped me). \n\nThe anatomy scan was a great help too. Again, I tried to schedule this for a decent interval between OB appointments. At that point (19+3) I was starting to feel some movement, which helped. I can say that each appointment and scan provided a few days worth of natural high that I was able to ride before the anxiety crept back in. \n\nI think from the anatomy scan until around 24 weeks I was constantly freaking out about incompetent cervix. I felt like none of my providers were concerned despite my lengthy surgical history, and that stressed me out. I stopped going to the gym for a while because I was paranoid. Once I hit the 24 week mark I figured IC would have shown its ugly face so then I just tried to get to 28 weeks in one piece because preterm birth outcomes are better at that point. Once there, I set my sights on 32 weeks, then 34.\n\nI had my shower around 31 weeks and *lost. my mind.* I thought I was jinxing things by having a shower or celebrating. I realized that somehow 31 weeks had gone by where I mostly had been waiting for the other shoe to drop and holding my breath that it wouldn't. I have bonded with this baby, but nowhere like I had with my second pregnancy, at least at that point. I couldn't even bring myself to talk to him for a while, not really sure why. Setting up the nursery came in very, very small steps. There were tears at each one. First we painted an accent wall. That was OK because if it didn't work out we could paint it back or just keep it. Then we traded out a piece of furniture for a dresser that can be used as a changing table. That was fine too. Then we got rid of the guest bed. That was a bit harder because where will guests sleep if we end up without a baby and can host people again? Then it was hard to do laundry. If I take the tags off things, I can't return them. What if this doesn't work out and I have all this stuff I can't return or give back to the people who gifted it to me? I cried so many tears and started little by little. \n\nI still worry that he might just die in there before I give birth, but I've come to embrace that if he doesn't I want to be ready for him so things are pretty ready around our house. I still wake up every morning and have a mini panic attack until I feel him move (part of my morning routine is to drink water and wait for him to wake up), but once that happens I can go about my day pretty normally. I think I started talking to him more and more around 28-30 weeks and now I feel much more attached to him. It took a really long time though, and that's one thing I wish I had done differently. As much as I want to protect myself from the devastation of loss, I really don't think it's going to make a difference at this point - I'll be crushed regardless so I might as well invest some of myself into this little guy who deserves all the love in the world. \n\nI think I'm just rambling at this point, so props if you've made it this far. I guess the TL;DR is I never felt secure in this pregnancy but I've learned to roll with it. It's OK to cry and be anxious, but if you can it's OK to get attached too. I hope things go even minimially more smoothly for you than they did for me.

I'm not getting assaulted every time I go in the break room. \n\nAt some point she also asked if I wanted to see her daughter's picture's from her first day at the playground. I said no.

I said no again. \n\nAfter that I felt bad so I sent her an email letting her know, no, I didn't want to see her kid doing all the same shit my stillborn kid would be doing and that was the reason. If anything I am sure that made her feel worse but maybe sometime people need to be hit over the head with an ounce of the horribleness I feel (felt) all the time. \n\nNo real advice just sympathy on how much it sucks and you aren't alone.

I think the dentist was a particular tough spot for me because my hygienist was among the first people to learn I was pregnant, because I had an appointment last year like a week after getting my positive and it meant they decided to put my X-rays off by a year. I had another visit like six weeks before I delivered, and the hygienist was excited to see me this month to find out whether I had had a boy or a girl. I've had to tell a lot of people, \"I had a boy but he was stillborn,\" but for whatever reason this particular encounter has been looming large in my mind for months. Maybe because I knew it would be one of the last times I would have to have the dead baby conversation. I was also very much hoping to be pregnant before this appointment so I could at least deliver tentatively happy news along with the sad, but no dice. I did tell her that we are trying, and if I am pregnant right now it's too soon to tell (I'm 4dpo). We agreed to do x-rays today because putting them off another year didn't feel like a good idea to either of us, but she double shielded me, \"just in case.\" It made me feel a little hopeful that she thought that there was enough of a chance of pregnancy that it was worth taking extra precautions, but she's a dental hygienist, not an OB, so it's not like I am giving this possibility any extra weight. I just overall don't really have a good feeling about this cycle for reasons I can't quite identify. I've had a couple of very sad days in a row. I feel like that's typical during the TWW, when I've done all I can do and all my focus towards ovulation and TTC becomes passive instead of active.  But I'm just very sad.\n\nAt least the dentist is done.
