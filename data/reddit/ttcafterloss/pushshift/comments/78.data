Yes, there are increased risks. But those risks are minute when it comes down to the real numbers. If you think about 1000 births, if a younger woman has a risk of 1 out of that 1000, we're often sitting at something like 2 out of 1000.

I have literally no one to talk to and I've cried enough in front of my kid. I feel so lost. \n\nHe had spina bifida (myeloschisis with several brain abnormalities) and we chose to terminate for those reasons. I didn't want my desire for a baby to overshadow the fact that that baby's life would be full of pain and medical interventions and unknowns. I know logically I made the right choice but my heart is telling me I killed my child. I know without a doubt I would have loved him no matter what. Did I make the right choice? I ask myself that over and over. \n\nI don't feel like I am allowed to say I miss him. That I love him just as much as I love his sister, my daughter.\n\nI haven't seen anyone in my family except my dad and I will see them all tomorrow when we move the remainder of our things. \n\nInto that big house with enough space for him. \n\nI just feel broken. I feel like I don't belong anywhere. I've been pregnant 3 times and I have 1 healthy child. My daughter, then an early miscarriage. Yes a miscarriage is sad, but this is a whole different level and scope of emotions. This is just, unbearable. \n\nI'm turning 36 next month. I was told to wait 1 year before trying again. I feel like our plans for the family we pictured are... gone. No other baby will ever replace my son. That just is what it is. \n\nBut I NEED another baby. My daughter won't stop talking about her brother even after I have told her several times he is dead, he was sick. She would be an amazing big sister. Our family is incomplete. This is something we have wanted so badly. \n\nI feel like the joy of being my daughters mom was taken away when she was a newborn due to severe postpartum anxiety and depression and I was so excited to be able to enjoy a baby at that stage. \n\nI don't know where I'm going with this. \n\nI'm sorry.", "created_utc": 1560547048, "gildings": {}, "id": "er6g8e9", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_c0najr", "locked": false, "no_follow": true, "parent_id": "t3_c0najr", "permalink": "/r/ttcafterloss/comments/c0najr/ttcafterloss_daily_discussion_thread_2_june_14/er6g8e9/", "retrieved_on": 1560547059, "score": 3, "send_replies": true, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "ttcafterloss", "subreddit_id": "t5_34scd", "total_awards_received": 0, "updated_utc": 1560816494}, {"all_awardings": [], "author": "Cashyemmy", "author_flair_background_color": null, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_template_id": null, "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_3kp3mxjm", "author_patreon_flair": false, "body": "Thank you for your encouragement!

And, once I met the surgeon and did all my consents, they immediately gave me happy drugs so I could relax before we got to the OR.
