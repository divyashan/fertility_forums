Point blank there is no such thing as a \u201cweak womb\u201d\u2014 there are chromosomal abnormalities, there are conditions like PCOS and endometriosis that make conceiving more challenging, and there is infertility. It\u2019s not some magical make believe entity that\u2019s either weak or strong, it\u2019s a vast system of biological functions that must align PERFECTLY in order for a baby to eventually arrive. My doctor told me something that was really reassuring after ours stopped developing at 8wks: \u201cwhen you look at how many different things can impact gestation, full term pregnancy with no issues is actually the miracle, there are a ton of factors that could have caused this and we\u2019ll never know which one it was this time, but it was nothing you did or wrong with your body.\u201d\n\nI might let them know that you appreciate their effort in being there for you, and perhaps the misplaced good intentions of giving you something to blame this on, but haphazardly diagnosing your body as weak is absolutely NOT OK. Let them know it hurts to be told that because it IS a hurtful thing to say. Let them know they are objectively wrong about it too. Let them know you are grieving and would more appreciate support than criticism. \n\nSending you love. This sucks, we all know it. It will get easier as you heal and process, but you are absolutely allowed to be grieving right now and do not need to feel a shred of guilt. \u2764\ufe0f", "created_utc": 1571339017, "gildings": {}, "id": "f436ocd", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_dj8otp", "locked": false, "no_follow": true, "parent_id": "t3_dj8otp", "permalink": "/r/ttcafterloss/comments/dj8otp/need_some_reassurance_that_its_not_my_fault/f436ocd/", "retrieved_on": 1571342551, "score": 1, "send_replies": true, "steward_reports": [], "stickied": false, "subreddit": "ttcafterloss", "subreddit_id": "t5_34scd", "total_awards_received": 0}, {"all_awardings": [], "associated_award": null, "author": "[deleted]", "author_flair_background_color": "", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_template_id": null, "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_text_color": "dark", "awarders": [], "body": "[deleted]", "created_utc": 1571339413, "gildings": {}, "id": "f4384wj", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_diymgl", "locked": false, "no_follow": true, "parent_id": "t3_diymgl", "permalink": "/r/ttcafterloss/comments/diymgl/bff_pregnant_and_im_not_anymore/f4384wj/", "retrieved_on": 1571343063, "score": 1, "send_replies": true, "steward_reports": [], "stickied": false, "subreddit": "ttcafterloss", "subreddit_id": "t5_34scd", "total_awards_received": 0}, {"all_awardings": [], "associated_award": null, "author": "channie18", "author_flair_background_color": null, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_template_id": null, "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_1x2t4m9k", "author_patreon_flair": false, "awarders": [], "body": "My sister in law and myself were pregnant at the same time.
