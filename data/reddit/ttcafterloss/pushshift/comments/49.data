I instantly began to cry, as she grabbed my hand and  said, \u201cmommy don\u2019t be sad. I\u2019m okay. Really! I love it here. And I love you and daddy!\u201d And then she ran off.

He is a vet and she is a new grad, started a few months ago. After two weeks, she finds out she's pregnant. Not planned. Thats fine, I only begrudge her because I'm a bitter woman. She's been sort of partnered with my husband for on call weekends and things, so he's been picking up a lot of her slack. Not because she's sick or incapable, but because she's scared she will be randomly kicked by an animal and lose the baby. Valid point I guess, but it should probably be taken up with her boss in my view. Instead she goes into the work calendar and changes the appointments to be under my husbands name. They are large animal vets and it's spring, so he's already so busy. \nThen she starts complaining that she doesn't want to touch sheep because they can carry toxoplasmosis and she might lose the baby. This is what our baby died of, and it's driving my husband insane, but he refuses to tell her we lost a baby. I'm so surprised that none of his workmates have pulled her aside and said he's the wrong person to be complaining to about it. It drives me crazy. Sure, have concerns, but if you're so worried that you can't do your job you should probably leave. \nIt all came to a head and my husband ended up yelling at her in front of all their colleagues about her being lazy. Luckily management were understanding and she is being \"dealt\" with. \nI don't know what it must be like to be partnered with someone who just talks about being pregnant all day after your own baby died without losing it.

The fetus had stopped developing at 7 weeks, and just like the pregnancy before that one, my body was showing no signs of miscarrying. I had had a difficult experience with misoprostol (2 doses and a 5-day wait before anything happened), so I opted for a D&amp;C. We also wanted genetic testing, so that seemed like the best option.\n\nWell... at my 2-week followup I was still bleeding too much for my comfort, or my OBGYN's. She told me to call for an ultrasound if the bleeding didn't stop within the next week. A few days later, I started passing big clots and gushing blood, just like you described. I called my doctor's emergency line and they scheduled me for an ultrasound the next morning and told me to go to the ER if it got worse (thankfully it didn't).\n\nOn the ultrasound, there was still retained tissue, so they scheduled my second D&amp;C for the next day. They did an ultrasound-guided one and were sure they got everything and that anything left would be so small as to not cause issues.\n\nSince I have a 26-day cycle and my body is fucking relentless, I got my period 4 days after the 2nd D&amp;C because of course. But then the bleeding transitioned from \"definitely my period\" to \"this is still from the pregnancy, isn't it?\" Luckily, it was light enough to handle.\n\nI bled lightly or spotted until my next period started on August 20th (3 days late), and had a pretty normal period. Except that I FINALLY passed the last bit of retained tissue. It was about the size of my pinky nail. When that period ended, it was finally over and I stopped bleeding completely.\n\nAnd the doctors started tracking my HCG levels sometime after the 2nd D&amp;C, though I don't remember when exactly. I had the last blood draw on August 20th when that period started, and my levels were FINALLY 5 that day.\n\nI hope that helps and that your experience ends up being a more pleasant one!", "created_utc": 1508323261, "gildings": {"gid_1": 0, "gid_2": 0, "gid_3": 0}, "id": "doj7efa", "link_id": "t3_770o3z", "parent_id": "t1_doisild", "retrieved_on": 1508323262, "score": 1, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "ttcafterloss", "subreddit_id": "t5_34scd"}, {"author": "singwejoyous", "author_created_utc": 1392938961, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_text": null, "body": "Okay operation temp at different times does not seem to be going well.
