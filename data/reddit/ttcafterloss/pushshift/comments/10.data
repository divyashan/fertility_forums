I had a CP before my MMC loss and my mom had a loss before me that she told me about in very graphic detail when I was young so I've always assumed I would MC at least once or twice (especially given how common CPs are). The other day a friend of mine announced to friends that she was pregnant at five weeks and someone shamed her for announcing so early because of MCs and she felt like total shit. Considering the fact that she is friends with me and hippo and her brother had a second tri loss due to turners syndrome she definitely wasn't naive to MCs either. She wanted to share because she knew she would need the support if anything happens. Though of course she got pregnant on her first try (dammit :P). I agree with what you said in another post as well to that I hope some of these naive people never have to experience what we went through. Even though I've always known how common MCs are I sometimes wish I could become naive. But at the end of the day my losses were extremely important life events that quite frankly shaped me for the better.
