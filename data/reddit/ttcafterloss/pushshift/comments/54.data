Everything with him started to unfold around 16 weeks. On Friday I had blood drawn and an in depth ultrasound at 16 weeks. Everything looked great with the ultrasound aside from measuring a few days behind. I get the dreaded call about bloodwork yesterday. He didn\u2019t even tell me the risk number, just that the baby tested high for T18. With the last baby I tested high.. 1:5.. This time is 1:36. My mouth dropped. Why is this happening to me after two perfectly healthy pregnancies and boys? So I go in for an nipt test today and get to wait forever for the results. I went through this just a year ago. Nipt showed no abnormalities the last time. I guess I\u2019m just super anxious bc the last time this happened my baby died. I\u2019m over here over analyzing everything -Why isn\u2019t my belly bigger? Why aren\u2019t I feeling movement? Why was the baby a few days behind? Etc. I am a worrier. I hate to be and I just need to vent. I know some of you saw my post yesterday. I just can\u2019t lose this one too. I was in such a dark place last year. It wasn\u2019t until I finally got pregnant again when I started to feel better and like myself again. I hadn\u2019t cried since October. Until yesterday. My husband is very calm and collected about it bc the last time it was a false reading. I guess I just worry if they\u2019re picking up something else. This is it for my husband and I. I need a miracle to happen. This is the last time I will ever be pregnant regardless of the outcome. I just started getting excited by telling people and making a few maternity purchases. I wish I never did their stupid test and demanded the nipt which \u201cis more accurate\u201d they say. Then why the heck do they even do the other one? Any tips on how to stay calm and collected in the next week or so waiting for more news? Last time I remember basically viewing the 1:5 as a death sentence and I became so detached. I\u2019m going to need to keep busy. I couldn\u2019t even sleep last night. I seriously can\u2019t believe this is happening. Like it\u2019s a sick joke or something.

There's no wrong way out grieving, you just have to do whatever you feel is best to get through this.\n\nOne thing I would advise is to make as many memories as you can. If you can't face doing it yourself, see if someone at the hospital can take hand/footprints (we had those, plus clay hand and footprints done), pictures, a lock of his hair etc. I find great comfort just knowing that I have these even if I don't look at them often. \n\nI wish you all the best.

We lost our son Sam at 39 weeks in May\u2014 I went into the hospital laboring with my baby, expecting to have a joyous (if exhausting) day. When they tried to find a heartbeat, it wasn\u2019t there. It was the worst day of my life, and the days and weeks that followed were hardly any better. \n\nIt\u2019s the most excruciating type of pain, but as others have said, the pain gets easier to carry, and the acuteness with which you are feeling it now will not last forever. You have found a wonderful and supportive place here.\n\nThe best thing I did following Sam\u2019s stillbirth was get connected to a perinatal loss therapist in my area. We still see her most weeks. \n\nYou will encounter many people who do not know what to say, and many people who say the wrong thing. Most people do want to help, so if you can have a short list of specific things that you might find helpful to offer to them, it might help smooth your social interactions in the short term. Saying something like, \u201csome freezer meals or UberEats gift cards would be useful if you want to do something for us\u201d is a good thing to have in your back pocket. (Also, asking people to bring wine when they stop by to stock your freezer is fine, I wish more people had thought to bring me wine...) \n\nYou will have moments of relative peace and calm and something akin to contentment. Hold on to those moments\u2014 they will give you the strength to get through the challenging days where you are sure you\u2019ll never be happy again. Anything that gives you comfort is a good thing, even if it\u2019s dumb\u2014 for me, I was (and am) convinced that every time I see a Volkswagen Beetle on the road, it\u2019s like a little hello from Sam. I can\u2019t explain why I feel this way, but it\u2019s like the little hug I need from him whenever it happens. It\u2019s mostly irrelevant whether I\u2019m accurate, because it\u2019s something that makes me feel good and connected to him, and of course it\u2019s an utterly harmless fantasy. \n\nFeel free to reach out to me if you ever want to talk, or vent, or ask questions, or anything.

Thinking of all of you and hoping a better day comes along soon. This pregnancy after loss shit is so hard.\n\nLast night one of our old friends happened to call my husband right after we put our 3yo to bed. He happened to be in the neighborhood running an errand for a friend and wondered if he could stop by since it\u2019s been a while since he had seen us. We hesitated, because we\u2019re in this weird place where I am visibly pregnant, but we haven\u2019t really told anyone besides family and a couple very close friends. But we decided to see what would happen, since after all, it wasn\u2019t that late and our preschooler was in bed. My husband asked if maybe I wanted to toss on a baggy sweatshirt but I opted against it, because I kind of figured that the worst that could happen would be this guy noticing I\u2019m pregnant, and at some point soon that will be completely unavoidable anyways.\n\nI really, really don\u2019t think he noticed. I\u2019m still a little amazed by this (and also wondering if maybe he just thought I was getting fat?) but acknowledging the possibility that he suspected it but realized that it\u2019s inappropriate to ask just in case he\u2019s wrong and I am just getting fat...\n\nAnyways. It does have me thinking. I have a blog that I\u2019ve been keeping since I had Sam, and I have considered what a post about the subsequent pregnancy might say, and have even tried to draft it, but keep getting stuck on exactly what I want to say. I\u2019m open to posting something there, but only if it\u2019s perfect. Otherwise we may just keep this unannounced until the baby is born. I\u2019m kind of okay with either option but at the same time, this pregnancy shares such an enormous link with Sam that it\u2019s almost hard NOT to discuss this.
