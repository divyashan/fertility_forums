Long, whiny, and ranty.\n\nWe officially lost the condo :/ Apparently, this place used to be owned by a different company that went bankrupt in the middle of the building project, so the current company bought it. They're currently building more, but because the original owner declared bankruptcy over the project, and they don't meet the minimum % of project completion, the government wont back any loans to buy into that association. The only way we could still get the condo is if we were to take on a riskier mortgage that is privately backed through a bank vs going the conventional route. Also, none of those banks could offer a fixed rate mortgage, so we would have to take a 5/1 or 7/1 ARM which essentially puts all the risk of this association onto our plates and guarantees that our interest rate will fluctuate after 10 years or so. This is the financing that they are offering to everyone that is purchasing a new construction (ours was an existing condo that we were purchasing from someone). \n\nWe already were paying a bit more than we wanted to spend, but was worth it for the place we were getting, but now with the addition of the flexible interest and already knowing there's no way we could pull off paying the mortgage off in 10 years, we just can't put ourselves in a situation where we get fucked over because of it, however unlikely that is.\n\nI'm so sad...we went to a few open houses this weekend to get a feel for what was currently on the market because we were pretty sure this was going to fall through. We were not impressed at all, so we may just be hunkering down in this 650 sq ft. apartment for a while until we find something that we like. I also wish they hadn't taken until 2 days before our closing date to get this all figured out. We could have been looking all this time.
