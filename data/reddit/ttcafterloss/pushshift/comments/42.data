And then I spiraled downward from there. My midwife explained that your serotonin gets replenished when you sleep, but if you can't sleep, it creates this vicious cycle and makes your mood worse and then continues to inhibit you from sleeping. Zoloft blocks the receptors that uptake serotonin so it allows your body to keep reusing the serotonin. They also gave me ambien for sleep which I used every night for about 2 weeks then transitioned off to melatonin as needed. Just getting sleep helped immensely and the Zoloft takes about a month to kick in but it did help a lot. My anxiety is much improved. You have to commit to taking it for like 6 months and you have to wean off of it. I tried to do it without any medication, thought it meant I was weak. And I realized that I am weak and that's okay, but using medication wasn't something to be ashamed of. We have been through hell. The worst pain imaginable. There's a small chance that we will make it through without some help. At least that's how I felt. My friends actually said they were really proud that i recognized that I needed more help and got on some medication. I was already trying about everything else in the books to try to feel better (counseling, journaling, walking outside, exercise, talking it out, I mean I tried lots of stuff). But the bottom line is that our hormones are completely screwed up because we had a baby. And also went through trauma. It's a huge hit to our bodies. It just bothers me that I was so stubborn and didn't start taking it earlier. I highly recommend asking your doctor about something. And there are tons of different medications and they don't always work the same so sometimes you have to try different things. Hope this is helpful.

There is some correlation (though not 100%) with low ovarian reserve and egg quality, and since that was the only thing that came up for us I think egg quality is an issue (we have had losses due to chromosomal abnormalities, as well as one unexplained). \n\nOnce we got the low ovarian reserve diagnosis, we were advised to freeze embryos for later if we wanted more than one kid, since it will likely be even harder for us a couple of years from now. We ended up with 4 blasts on day 6, but only 2 were normal, and those 2 were the best looking and the worst looking of the bunch (meaning without PGS we would have transferred the bad ones 2nd and 3rd). I'm sure you know all too well that chromosomally abnormal can still get good grades.\n\nDid you do PGS testing? What was your original infertility diagnosis? I hope this was just shit luck and you don't have some autoimmune on top of infertility, but that's been known to happen. I'd go for the RPL testing if you can afford the copays (assuming you're american) and also highly recommend PGS testing on any remaining embryos if you didn't already do that. We are here for you as you continue your journey. *hugs*", "can_gild": true, "controversiality": 0, "created_utc": 1495718879, "distinguished": null, "gilded": 0, "id": "di0vunf", "link_id": "t3_6d8vxz", "nest_level": 1, "parent_id": "t3_6d8vxz", "reply_delay": 8975, "retrieved_on": 1496815638, "score": 1, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "ttcafterloss", "subreddit_id": "t5_34scd"}, {"author": "impetuousraven", "author_created_utc": 1458849358, "author_flair_css_class": "", "author_flair_text": "TTC #1 since 7/14, MC 4/15 & 5/16, CP 2/16", "author_fullname": "t2_wmn36", "body": "I've taken both Clomid (clomiphene) and Femara (letrozole), and (obviously) it has not worked for me, but it does work for many folks in terms of speeding up conception (with increased risks of multiples). Clomid tends to be the first option because it has a long history and lots of data, but [recent research in the New England Journal of Medicine](http://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa1313517) suggests Femara may be more effective. I will say, both of them can have some massively shitty side effects. First, dosage is a crapshoot to begin with, so your response can throw off your TTC efforts. For example, I took a low dose of Clomid in November, turned out to be a \"super responder\" developed 7 follicles that all turned into cysts and was benched until February (and miserable with cysts and BCPs). Physically, letrozole has worked better for me, but I just finished my fourth round of it, and have had worsening major depressive episodes each month. This doesn't happen for everyone, but it is not uncommon, and it is after all an off label cancer drug that effects your pituitary gland, so shit happens.\n\nSo here's the thing, you can do it, but go into it being prepared for what may come. You also need to be mentally prepared to start the infertility treatment journey in case it does not work. Most doctors will tell you that you should not do more than 6 cycles with it, and the odds of it working after 4 significantly drops off. For us, that was the beginning of our path to IVF (starting next month). I had been TTC for quite a long time before I started it, so I was ready to accept those next steps as necessary (we also are skipping a lot of in between steps because I need this awful, dark chapter of my life to end ASAP). \n\nAnyhow, that is a lot of stuff, and I am not totally sure it is what you wanted to hear.

Maybe plant a tree or get a plaque on a bench, or get them a sweet wooden block with their baby's name on it. A nice children's book with their baby's name engraved in it. These are gifts that they can maybe show future kids, say \"this was your big brothers, this tree was planted for him\".
