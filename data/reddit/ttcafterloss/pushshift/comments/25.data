Its baby shower day and I am irrationally anxious. We have friends and family who have flown in from four different states to be here, plus all the locals and folks who drove from 2-4 hours away in-state. it's going to be about 40 people. I'm overwhelmed and baffled (but thrilled) that there are so many people who wanted to be here to support us that much. We spent yesterday madly cleaning and organizing the house to deal with the influx of baby stuff, which was super satisfying for my early nesting instinct. And I know from our registry that after today, we'll have all the necessities that will make it feasible for us to bring home a baby (plus a lot of non-necessities). There's so much to be excited and happy about today.\n\nSo I'm anxious because... I'm too excited? I'm afraid of being the center of attention? I just want this afternoon to hurry up and get here? I'm worried I'll look puffy and gross in the photos? What if I commit some kind of awful social faux pas? I don't know. \n\nThe kicker is that tomorrow is the one year anniversary of finding out about our MMC. After all the excitement today, I'm expecting a big emotional letdown.

Fortunately nobody was injured but it smashed 4 cars, took out power to the neighbourhood for 24 hours, and smashed the front of three houses.  The tree was over 100 years old and rather large. Although our house isn't leaking or falling apart, the tree destroyed the area where the power connects to the three damaged houses which means that needs to be repaired before power can be connected again. So without power our house is uninhabitable until who knows when.\n\nWe initially evacuated to my in law's place about an hour away. They are incredible. So helpful a dan generous. I don't know what we'd do without them! We thought we'd only be here one or two nights but it looks like we're going to have to find a place to live for a while longer. Tonight my husband returned home to assess the damage and is staying the night in the dark while my son and I stay here with family. Our neighbours have all rushed to help out (all but the three ranged houses have power back). He received 5 dinner invitations and lots of support. He's taking the day off work tomorrow to organise repairs with the landlord, insurance company, and the electric company. Tomorrow my in laws are watching our son while I go to work. \n\nIn pregnancy news, we had our 19 week scan on Wednesday and everything is normal! Normal is great! The technician said \"normal\" a lot and I never got sick of hearing it. The only issue is I have a low-lying placenta which will be looked at again in the third trimester. \n\nTW: mention of living child. My son came to the appointment with us and he was awestruck. He often talks to his baby sister, pats my tummy and says \"I love you baby sister.\" He made a point to say thank you to the technician (baby doctor) after the appointment without any prompting from us. He's going to be the best big brother!\n\nMy belly has officially popped and I am now obviously pregnant. I have become much more comfortable telling people about the pregnancy as time goes by. It was difficult and made me anxious before but now it feels normal to tell people. \n\nI really hope we can get back in our house soon and return to our normal lives. This weekend was a bit exciting with all the drama but the novelty of being evacuated has already worn off. Hope you guys are having a better weekend than me!
