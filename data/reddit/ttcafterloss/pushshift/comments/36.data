Only 8 weeks to go, it doesn't feel like long enough!\n\nMy husband's interview yesterday went well! I mean, it's hard to tell with these things but he seemed pretty confident and it sounds like he said all the right things. He was still full of nervous tension when we got home so I brought up the sex thing, like \"maybe we should give it a go and see if it helps relax you?\" and he didn't really respond, but at least it was out there. Then in the evening I asked him if he wanted to come up to bed with me, so he did, but then refused to do anything more than cuddle. So I asked if this was something we needed to talk about, and he got all awkward and left the room, then came back like ten minutes later and told me that he feels weird about having sex with the baby in there and that he's just not turned on by me at the moment. So.... ouch. I mean, I get it, but ouch! So I guess sex is just completely off the table for the next 8 weeks at least, and then however long it takes me to recover from giving birth as well, and then I don't know if either of us will actually be in the mood with a newborn around taking up all our energy, so it could be a while yet. Which will be interesting because we've never really not had sex before. I mean, my husband is basically a one night stand gone somewhat awry, so we never even had time that we were dating and not having sex. Who really believes that getting pregnant will make a relationship stronger? Maybe we'll come out stronger at the end, who knows, but right now it feels like it's forcing us apart.\n\nEdit: lol, not ten minutes after posting this someone sent me a link to a website for cheating on your spouse!

Eeeeek! We went in for our growth scan yesterday. Baby looked good, but was measuring small and is only in the 13th percentile. The MFM also pointed out that he has an enlarged umbilical vein going into his liver. This vein collapses after the cord is cut and she sees them enlarged every once in a while, but she felt the strange need to tell us that they have been seen in still births. Thanks, lady. If we weren't monitoring him so closely, we probably never would have even know about it. She did say that she's been watching it since 20 weeks and that she's never had a still birth with one, that it's likely just a coincidence in the cases where it's seen. So why did you feel the need to mention it at all to someone with a high risk pregnancy? THEN she said that I should push my OB to wait and induce me until 39 weeks since my hypertension seems to be well controlled by the meds. Erhm, no. What the hell. \n\nAfter that, I was pretty upset and we headed down the hall to see my OB. She immediately called me out on being upset. When she asked what was going on, I told her that the ultrasound had stressed me out. She said that she had seen that finding on my chart but wasn't worried about it because she had never heard of it and because she still wants to induce me at 37. Inducing me will allow us to monitor him closely the whole time. She said that the new regulations for hypertension are very clear on when to induce. She was more worried about his weight and my anxiety and thinks that he will do better on the outside at this point. She brought me some juice and crackers and then gave me a NST to ease my mind. He passed with flying colors. We scheduled the induction so that she can (hopefully) be the one to deliver him, just as she delivered my son and did my d&amp;c. That was really important to me. She will have delivered all my babies. \n\nI don't even know where this is all going, I haven't even processed it all yet. I'm trying to put what the MFM said out of my head and just trust my OB and my body but it's so hard. I was finally starting to get excited and now I just feel terrified again.
