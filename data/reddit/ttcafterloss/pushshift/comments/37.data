Third trimester is a major milestone for me. I am so glad to say goodbye to the second tri. If the first tri was physically miserable and exhausting, the second tri was just as exhausting emotionally. We dealt with worries about abnormal AFP levels and uterine arterial notching, had the scary suspected brain bleed episode (two weeks of my life that almost feel like they belong to someone else now), making it through Isaac's gestational milestone and Isaac's birthday, I think three drop-in doctor's visits because of anxiety, many anxious days and nights...phew. That being said, I also got to feel baby's movements get stronger and more consistent, we had four growth scans and many doctor's visits, and saw my belly grow larger than last time. I hope the next twelve weeks are just boring third-trimester weeks that culminate with an uneventful hospital birth of a healthy baby. Yesterday I bought some newborn size items (some onesies) for the first time and was a big ball of emotions in the consignment store (while my husband played with Nerf guns and action figures...lol).\n\nSymptom inventory: I've started to feel some fatigue and nausea trickling back in. My emotions are CRAZY! My boobs are sore and I see little crusty spots in my bra at the end of the day, so clearly they are getting ready for something. I don't have any stretch marks on my belly (yet), but there are a couple on my hips and plenty on my boobs. Pelvic pain and back pain continue to march on, helped somewhat by my Snoogle and prenatal yoga. Leg cramps at night sometimes, heartburn and super vivid dreams. I am often hungry and the pressure on my bladder is definitely increasing! Baby moves much more consistently now and even though I still can't help but worry on his somewhat quieter days, he is still well within the range of normal so it's a little easier to shut my mind off. Every kick still feels like a little miracle!
