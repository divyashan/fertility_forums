My due date would have been 10th of June and just like you I really hoped I would be pregnant by now. I've been seeing a therapist lately and she has helped me tremendously. Obviously, these things may not be applicable to you, but they are helping me a lot, so I'll try to share best I can:\n\n- try to work on a positive mindset. I'm tackling this from a few different angles. First, I searched for a positive phrase that resonated with me. For me it's \"one day I'll hold my child in my arms\". I wrote that on little notes and distributed them in our flat so that I'm seeing them often every day. Second, I started meditating. It's just a couple of minutes every day but it helps me stop my thoughts from spiraling downwards on hard days. Third, try to find the things that you enjoy in life and fill your life with them as much as possible. This one is really tricky with COVID going on, but even just making holiday plans or planning a hiking trip takes my mind off of TTC effectively.\n\n- be open with family /friends about how you feel. Coincidentally we are going to be staying with my family for my due date and my sister is pregnant. It was really hard for me to tell her that it was my due date (honestly, nobody but me seems to remember our care!) and that I probably wouldn't want to see her on that day. And she understands and accepts that. And in hindsight it's a weight lifted off my shoulders. Also I had to tell my husband that this day is going to be hard for me and I will need him to support me. It hadn't really occurred to him.\n\n- lastly how to cope with the day itself. Ask yourself :what do I want that day to look like? Do I want it to be just like any other day? Do I want to do something special? For me it was clear immediately that I don't want to work on that day, I just can't see myself holding it together at work. So I took the day off. I also want to do something to to remember my unborn baby on that day. I'm not entirely sure yet what that is going to be, but I thought about writing a letter, maybe tying it to a balloon to send it off or maybe not sending it at all. Other things that I've considered but that didn't resonate with me are : plant a tree, do a really big shopping trip, donate to charity, treat myself to a spa day.

I did have a private scan on May 2 just to make sure everything was OK after surgery, and the sonographer told me it looked like I was about to O, so my husband and I DTD EOD for a while, but I have no idea when/if it happened, although due to the CP situation I think I did at some point.\n\nSo just to clarify, your loss happened on 6 May, meaning that you're on CD29 atm, and you started CBAD around CD20?  If your cycles pre-MC were 37 days, would you have expected O to have been around CD17-18 or later than that?  Either way, I want to tell you to not be concerned if this cycle you're in at the moment is a bit out of the ordinary - it's very, very usual post-MC because your body is essentially having to recalibrate.\n\nSeparately, I know exactly how the wait for your period to return, and the desire to start again (but knowing where you are in your cycle), can be agonising, but if you're still under the time-frame that you would've expected it to arrive historically, it's totally possible that it could come back bang on time as you've said.

So enough of my back history ... this month i had convinced myself that i had finally conceived again . I had every symptom these past few days and AF was due to arrive on Saturday . I had been trying so so hard not to test at all this week and told myself that I\u2019d allow myself to test on Friday . Well i woke up this morning and AF has arrived early. So much for the super sore boobs , crazy dreams and the nausea that has been so bad in the mornings . Ugh I\u2019m so frustrated and this is starting to bring up all those old feelings again from the last two times we have been down this road . We have been to the doctors multiple times and have been tested for everything under the sun and all we keep hearing is there is no major medical reason why this is happening . It\u2019s just completely unexplainable. I feel like because of my age my time is running out and i May never get a chance to carry my own baby .

My strips aren't necessarily darker than the control line, but as dark as the line.

I also use the premom app, it's great for logging the strips because you can see the progression.

Also - I was doing a little experiment by taking multiple photos of tests at the same time so this photo is a little wonky lol, oh AND it says \"CD5\" even though that was CD39 for me when I ovulated because unfortunately this app doesn't account for longer cycles and reset me at 35 days.
