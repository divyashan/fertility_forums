So 9.5 is actually pretty decent. You would need to have it checked multiple cycles to see if there is an issue with progesterone. BUT -- the research is definitely not conclusive regarding progesterone.\n\nWhat seems to be the biggest conclusion is that low 7dpo progesterone may mean the ovulation was poor/the egg quality wasn't great. But that isn't for sure, either. If you are found to have low P on numerous cycles, some doctors will suggest clomid/femara to try to help the ovulation. OR doctors will put you on progesterone supplements after ovulation. But with a 9.5 you likely don't need either.\n\nAlso, if you're 10dpo and haven't started your period, your luteal phase is just fine. \n\nSpotting is quite common, or \"normal\" -- I rarely use that term regarding fertility anymore because every body is so different. I actually did seem to have bad egg quality/poor progesterone, but I didn't ever spot pre-period. This is why fertility studies are SO hard.\n\nFeeling overwhelmed and resentful makes sense -- pregnancy loss is bullshit and really messes with your mind.

He was born sleeping on Friday. \nMy husband and I have 2 kids at home under 3. We have always wanted a big family and plan to try for another eventually.\n\nHere's the thing that scares me though. I am RH negative. My husband has A+ blood so I have to get the rogham shot after every birth, miscarriage or anytime I bleed during pregnancy.

I'm worried that I didn't get it soon enough after the bleed and my body created antibodies against my son's blood and that's why he passed. If that is the case, any future Pregnacies would be extremely high risk. The child would have a 50% chance of having positive blood that my body would then attack and it could lead to a lot of serious health problems in the child, or still birth. I don't know how I could ever go through this again and I'm scared out of my mind. But the thought of my daughter being my last child is heartbreaking.
