What type of loss did you have (i.e. miscarriage, ectopic, stillbirth, etc.) and how far along were you? 2 MCC. 1: thought I was 10w, stopped growing at 7; 2: thought I was 9w stopped growing at 8\n\n2. Did you have a D&amp;C/surgery/etc. or lose the pregnancy naturally? 1. D&amp;c  2. Cytotec \n\n3. How long did you have period-like bleeding after your loss? 1. No period like bleeding  2. Heavy flow and on off for almost 6 week\n\n4. How long did you spot for? 1. 1-2 weeks 2. Once the flow was finished, I think I spotted for maybe a week\n\n5. Did you need any additional followup for the bleeding/spotting (i.e. a D&amp;C to remove retained tissue)? If applicable - did your doctor consider your level of bleeding to be \"normal\"? No follow up. My cytotec bleeding was considered normal as my body was trying to push out pregnancy tissue. \n\n6. Add any additional relevant details here.\nMy period came 5.5 weeks after my d&amp;c and 8 weeks after cytotec \n", "controversiality": 0, "created_utc": 1427289920, "distinguished": null, "gilded": 0, "id": "cpq67iv", "link_id": "t3_307c5l", "nest_level": 1, "parent_id": "t3_307c5l", "reply_delay": 42837, "retrieved_on": 1432003413, "score": 2, "score_hidden": false, "subreddit": "ttcafterloss", "subreddit_id": "t5_34scd"}, {"author": "theotterisntworking", "author_created_utc": 1366984714, "author_flair_css_class": "", "author_flair_text": "TTC #1, 2 mc's in 2014", "author_fullname": "t2_bgtmz", "body": "You can pee in the strip's package!
