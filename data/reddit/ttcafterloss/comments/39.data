He's 11 and 6lbs and it stresses me out so much to have him go under, I've been crying about it all week, and I'm sure that's part pregnancy but also he's just my baby I've had since I was 19! Apparently they have to put dogs under now to clean their teeth... 3 years ago I had it done and they didn't. I made the appt on a Friday so I can cuddle him all weekend but I feel bad. He kind of holds grudges too so I'm guessing he won't like me very much this weekend. Ugh... At least it's something else to stress over that's not human baby related!
