I\u2019ve seen two midwife practices on opposite coasts and both were set up more or less like this\u2014 if your risk is heightened in any way, they have MDs to back up their care/take over your case. For this current pregnancy, I\u2019m seeing a midwife despite having a scheduled csection planned for 38 weeks, and my midwives are totally supportive of that. They obviously won\u2019t be able to perform the surgery, but one will be in the room with me at delivery and they\u2019ll be the ones checking on me for the duration of my hospital stay. This was the same with my birth on the west coast\u2014 I wound up w/ a CSection and while there was not a midwife present in the OR (it was a teaching hospital so the OR was pretty crowded with residents) the midwives on call were the ones to check on me/my stitches/my healing a couple times a day and the next one showed up with each shift change. I also went there for my follow up care. They definitely treat a natural vaginal birth as the optimal outcome but I have never felt like a midwife wasn\u2019t doing what she felt was absolutely best for mine and my baby\u2019s health or honoring my choices (where medically applicable). I like the care of a midwife because they seem so much more invested in a holistic approach to prenatal care\u2014 how you\u2019re feeling mentally, etc. This is especially important to me after my stillbirth. My midwife\u2019s steady, soothing presence got me through that day. The birth is one day but the pregnancy is nine months, and especially in this case I felt midwife care was the best way to negotiate enduring this pregnancy, even though I won\u2019t have spent months building up a trusting relationship with the doctor who is eventually assigned to slice this baby out of me\u2014 it\u2019s enough for me that my midwife will implicitly trust that person.

It was 18 weeks before we told them and honestly we would have waited longer if it weren\u2019t becoming obvious. We are also very standoffish in just talking about this pregnancy\u2014 casual excited chitchat feels so tone deaf. I tend to brush it off when it\u2019s a brief encounter with a stranger in the grocery store, but when it\u2019s someone who knows what we\u2019ve been through, I tell them to hold their congratulations for me until I have a live baby in my arms. I bristle when people reference our future with a new baby\u2014 I know now that there\u2019s no guarantee of that and it truly irritates me when people treat it as a given, especially because I\u2019m now nearing the third trimester. I honestly mostly try to shut down pregnancy talk\u2014 I\u2019ve always hated pregnancy small talk because it\u2019s both boring and personal, which is the worst combo for small talk, but now I just absolutely cannot bring myself to fake enthusiasm for a conversation about baby kicks or maternity pants. It all seems so trivial when all I want is this baby to come out alive, and the baby kick conversations are particularly triggering for me because I could feel my son moving even after he had died, so I never trust my own perception of fetal movement now.\n\nBecause of that, I also got a doppler for this pregnancy. I had avoided them in my previous pregnancies because I thought they would make me more anxious when I wasn\u2019t able to find the heartbeat immediately, and I felt the fixation wasn\u2019t worth it. But this time around I have truly needed the peace of mind that comes with having it\u2014 I\u2019d rather feel anxious for a few minutes of searching for the heartbeat than feel anxious for a couple of weeks in between appointments.

If you are concerned about future unintended pregnancies before you and your boyfriend are ready, you can also review your birth control options with your gynecologist, as well as how to use them.  The third thing your doctor may be able to do is provide a letter for your professors, if you need to request a deferral of assignments or exams.  \n\nRegarding your boyfriend, everyone deals with a loss differently, and at different speeds.  It can be a big challenge for a lot of couples to try to support their partners, when they are grieving in different ways, or when one is feeling better sooner than the other.    Just keep trying to talk about where you are each at, and try to give each other space/support to do what you both need to do.  \n\nIt's also possible, because your pregnancy was unplanned, that your boyfriend had some feelings of fear when you guys first learned of the pregnancy.  He may now not just feel bad about the loss, but also feel guilty about his previous fears.  (You may be too.)\n\nMany women find it helpful to see a counselor or therapist while they work through their grief.  Many college campuses offer mental health/counseling services that are free or low-cost.  Do a Google search, or contact your university health services, to see what is available at your campus.  When making an appointment, you can ask if any of their therapists have experience counseling about miscarriage or pregnancy loss.  \n\nAlternatively, you might also ask your gynecologist or OB if they know of counseling or therapists who specialize in pregnancy loss.  However, this may not be covered by insurance, or to get coverage, you might need your parent's help to get the visits authorized (if your insurance is through them).   It might be tricky navigating this conversation with your parents, while maintaining your privacy.  (Saying, \"I'd like to see a therapist, and my Dr. has referred me to see X person.\"  They'll definitely ask for the details of what is going on, because they want to know what they can do to help.)  \n\nTake care of yourself, and go easy on yourself!", "can_gild": true, "controversiality": 0, "created_utc": 1520918209, "distinguished": null, "gilded": 0, "id": "dvm68mg", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_83zl2t", "nest_level": 1, "no_follow": true, "parent_id": "t3_83zl2t", "permalink": "/r/ttcafterloss/comments/83zl2t/i_recently_had_a_miscarriageseeking_advice/dvm68mg/", "reply_delay": 21232, "retrieved_on": 1525104012, "score": 1, "send_replies": true, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "ttcafterloss", "subreddit_id": "t5_34scd", "subreddit_type": "public"}, {"author": "SunfriedTomatoes", "author_created_utc": 1470979555, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_text": null, "author_fullname": "t2_10dkto", "body": "Ugh.

After taking misoprostol for a missed miscarriage in December, repeated follow-up ultrasounds showed something in my uterus--my OB was pretty sure it was a polyp, but I wanted it out straight away.  So this was not just an exploratory hysteroscopy; she went in planning to surgically remove a mass in my uterus.  \n\nI was told I could choose between general anesthesia and \"heavy sedation,\" and I chose the latter because of the quicker hospital recovery time (they told me general anesthesia would take 3-4 hours before I could go home, but with the sedation I could be ready an hour after the procedure).  I had had a prior D&amp;C (years ago, different miscarriage) under heavy sedation and seriously did not remember anything so I was fine with it.\n\nThe procedure was short, I remember nothing after being rolled out of the pre-op room, and then I woke up in the recovery room about an hour (tops) later telling the nurse how hot my anesthesiologist was.  I was a little uncomfortable for the rest of the day but I went back to work the next day.  In retrospect, I was still a little out of it and should probably have taken that day off, but it was fine.  I received maybe two or three days' worth of oxycodone or percocet, but I didn't need to take it all, though I did take the Rx-level advil for the full three days.  \n\nPathology results indicated that the mass my OB extricated was actually retained products of conception, which was a surprise.  All the other pictures show a perfectly normal uterus, and my RE did a saline sonogram a few weeks after the hysteroscopy and confirmed no scar tissue/adhesions.  \n\nI'm also on synthroid for hypothyroidism (and have been for years), but all my other tests are normal save for a \"low-normal\" AMH.  \n\nHappy to answer any more questions about the procedure, and will be thinking of you and seeing how it goes/what you find.

I don\u2019t know what he means by that but I guess we\u2019ll do that for now and schedule the actual procedure if I feel like this afternoon wasn\u2019t sufficient to \u201csee everything.\u201d I don\u2019t know. I\u2019m just sick of this crap and trying to hold a constant search for something that might not even exist. \n\nEdit: Also, I\u2019m kind of grateful to wait for summer if we do decide to proceed with the procedure because my husband leaves in a couple weeks...and selfishly (for both of us), Id rather not be banned from sex for a week for recovery right before he\u2019s gone for 6 months. \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffc\u200d\u2640\ufe0f", "can_gild": true, "controversiality": 0, "created_utc": 1520952340, "distinguished": null, "edited": 1520952720, "gilded": 0, "id": "dvmpigs", "is_submitter": true, "link_id": "t3_8401kb", "nest_level": 2, "no_follow": true, "parent_id": "t1_dvmnngi", "permalink": "/r/ttcafterloss/comments/8401kb/those_who_have_had_a_hysteroscopy/dvmpigs/", "reply_delay": 1873, "retrieved_on": 1525114837, "score": 1, "send_replies": true, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "ttcafterloss", "subreddit_id": "t5_34scd", "subreddit_type": "public"}, {"author": "couragefish", "author_created_utc": 1415639990, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_text": null, "author_fullname": "t2_jakmu", "body": "Haha I wish!
