My husband got snappy with me this morning because I haven't followed up with the insurance company yet about the Rhogam shot they denied coverage for when I was miscarrying.

And to be fair, I have been putting off this latest call because I hate thinking about it, nothing ever gets resolved, and every time I talk to them it's like I'm right back there on the worst day of my life.\n\nI can't help feeling kind of hurt/frustrated by my husband though. I told him a while ago that I would really like him to help with this because I find it so difficult to deal with, and all I've got so far is nagging. Today he was like \"Well, if YOU don't want to do it, I guess you can just GIVE me the paperwork.\", but it wasn't loving or kind. I don't know why he couldn't just be gentle and offer help rather than getting pissy at me. \n\nMaybe I'm being a jerk and need to just nut up and get this done (again), but part of me is angry that I have to deal with this ongoing saga that just keeps stabbing at me when he could help take some of this burden off my shoulders. He wasn't there when I had a crying breakdown at the pharmacy, he wasn't even there when I had the appointment where I found out I was losing the baby after I started bleeding (he begrudgingly offered, but I could tell he didn't want to go so I let him off the hook). So I guess it makes sense that he's not there for this either. It just sucks that I have to keep dealing with this every damn day and it's mostly by myself even though it was half his baby.\n\nEdit: Stuck on the phone with insurance company for over half an hour, they lost my paperwork and asked me a bunch of invasive questions, cried a lot.

So the RE thinks it's not going to grow much more, and she's worried that if we keep waiting the egg will get too old.  \n\nProtocol now is to keep testing with ovulation tests today and tomorrow, and if I haven't surged yet, trigger tomorrow night and IUI Saturday morning.  If I do manage to surge today or tomorrow, then to trigger right away and come in the next morning for an IUI.  My money's on the not-surging-IUI-Saturday scenario.\n\nOther than that, we also had a regular check-in with our RE, and talked about the overall plan.  She thinks we have about a 30% chance this cycle with the IUI and the follicle that I do have.  Next cycle, she wants to up my dose of Femara from 5 to 7.5 so hopefully we get consistently two good follicles.  Then if that doesn't work, the third IUI cycle will be Femara 7.5 plus some injectable FSH.  With that whole plan, she estimates a 60-70% chance that we will get pregnant in those three cycles.  If we don't, she said the odds drop pretty dramatically.\n\nIf after 3 IUIs we're not pregnant, she said there's typically some other underlying issue that can't be identified.  She said we could go on to do 3 more with injectables-only, but that at that point we only have a 10-12% chance of any of those working.  And then if nothing, we have to decide if we want to do IVF.\n\nSo basically I'm really scared and sobbing a lot this morning.  Why couldn't my follicles have grown better over the past two days so at least we have better odds this cycle?  Why is this all so fucking hard for us?
