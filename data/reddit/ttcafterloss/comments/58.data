I hope some of the advice in this thread is helpful as you contemplate your options. \n\nI've had 3 MMC's now, and a spontaneous miscarriage as well.\n\nMy first MMC, I found out at a routine checkup and then was scheduled for D&amp;C the next morning - this was possibly my best D&amp;C experience. My doctor specifically wanted to spare me the waiting so I could move forward with my grief and I have appreciated the way he handled it ever since. I may not have liked his approach to RPL testing, but the way he handled the loss itself was amazing.\n\nMy second MMC, I had a doctor that sounds similar to yours. Cold, distant, didn't have time for me. Said I could either wait it out or D&amp;C, and to call back when I'd decided. I remember her as having all the empathy of a goldfish. Once I'd decided however, the procedure was done very quickly. Again, not a lot of agonizing wait.\n\nMy third MMC I had a week long wait. My RE only does surgeries once a week on Tuesdays, and I'd found out on a Wednesday. That week was one of the longest in my life. Pure torture the entire time.\n\nThere is a third possibility between \"wait\" and \"D&amp;C\" you may wish to talk about with your doctor - medically assisted miscarriage. Some of these ladies habe already mentioned it with various experiences. For my third MMC, I was prescribed cytotech/misoprostol to help soften my cervix to make the D&amp;C easier - I ended up passing the pregnancy that day. It turned out that's the same drug that's used to speed up or \"trigger\" a miscarriage that's not starting on it's own. This could be a middle ground if you really would prefer to miscarry naturally/at home instead of D&amp;C, but don't want to wait around or be caught unawares when it happens. I am not a doctor, so it's worth discussing your situation with your own medical care team - but it's worth knowing there could be a 3rd option for you.", "can_gild": true, "controversiality": 0, "created_utc": 1524515035, "distinguished": null, "gilded": 0, "id": "dxujdwg", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_8e5yhu", "nest_level": 1, "no_follow": true, "parent_id": "t3_8e5yhu", "permalink": "/r/ttcafterloss/comments/8e5yhu/just_diagnosed_with_a_mmc_and_waiting_is_torture/dxujdwg/", "reply_delay": 86161, "retrieved_on": 1526658921, "score": 1, "score_hidden": false, "send_replies": true, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "ttcafterloss", "subreddit_id": "t5_34scd", "subreddit_type": "public"}, {"author": "nutella47", "author_created_utc": 1340822599, "author_flair_css_class": "", "author_flair_template_id": null, "author_flair_text": "TTC #1, CP 9/15, MMC 12/15, MMC 6/16", "author_fullname": "t2_85cou", "body": "That's great.

It was fun and it was a good crowd of people. Since I have a mini van and am also, you know, sober until June, I offered to drive from the hotel to the spa. On the drive back, the MOH, who hasn\u2019t been updated on my life in a while, and the bride, who I am closer too but has understandably been too busy to keep up with the granular details, asked how things were going with my in laws. In the course of trying to give them a short version of the story, it really became necessary to tell a whole van full of people about my stillbirth and the subsequent struggles with my in laws as a result of their inability to reasonably deal with us in our grief.  So that was weird and awkward but probably inevitable. \n\nBut not EVERYONE who showed up at the party actually was in the van, a handful of people missed out on the spa part and showed up later. So they didn\u2019t hear the whole history and I got asked some questions about the pregnancy that really felt like they crossed a line, though probably would have felt more normal in a more normal pregnancy. So that was a little sticky. I\u2019m glad I went to the party, especially bc the wedding is too close to my due date to attend, but it\u2019s just another time where the visibility of pregnancy and the lack of more obvious small talk topics makes this a really hard thing to navigate socially.
