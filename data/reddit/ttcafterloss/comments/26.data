Nurse here and woman who has miscarried more than once. I have a few questions to ask you. Is the smell very foul? Like, putrid, foul? Or just, strange? Gestational material has a different smell from period blood but a foul smell could mean infection. Second, how far along were you? Sometimes the gestational material that comes out can look greyish-pale white in color and be very thick in nature. \nIt's good to note you don't have a fever. That would be something important that you would need to see a medical professional about ASAP. If you have foul-smelling discharge (regardless of the color) that is also something that needs to be told to a medical professional. \n\nIt's possible you could have a yeast infection. Right after I had my daughter I had one and with the lochia smell (after birth discharge that has the same type of smell as miscarriage (I'm a nurse I don't have a problem with TMI)) it smelled god-awful and was white and clumpy. \n\nAbdominal cramping goes along with the miscarriage and upset stomach is common with misoprostel although I don't know about how long after the dose that the effects could last.\n\nI think its worth going to the ER.

I feel your emotions with every single line. My heart aches for you because I know all to well the frustrations of repeat CPs. I'm not sure if you know this but I'm a nurse and in my field we see plenty of people that have taken to the internet to make themselves well-informed about what could be going on with their health and their bodies. It is a natural response to seek answers to medical situations that can seem utterly out of your control. What better way to have some small amount of control than to research your way into understanding? Self-advocacy is the pillar of good medical care. Don't ever stop that. Just be cautious of the self-diagnosis trap. \n\nAs a nurse I often run into the problem that is a common saying, \"As nurses we know too much and always assume that the worst thing that COULD happen, WILL happen.\" My midwife and my OB always tell me that my knowing too much can cause me more anxiety than good. With that said, I still do a lot of research and I have lots of information in hand (my cycles mapped out to a T, what day I had my first faint lines to the day I either miscarried or the lines disappeared just like yours). And I ask questions until I am completely satisfied with my understanding of what is going on. \n\nI can tell you that at first my OB waived off my first chemical pregnancy like it meant nothing. \"I wish women would not take a pregnancy test until they are a week late. Chemical pregnancies can occur to any woman anytime and it does not often mean anything.\" At the time I trusted his advice because we did not have enough information at that time. We had not been trying for a year and he said it would take up to a year for a healthy couple to conceive. I asked him tons of questions and we kept trying. \n\nFast forward a few years and a few more chemical pregnancies, one live birth, and a few miscarriages and he agreed that it was no small thing that I had chemical pregnancies to begin with. I was referred to a fertility specialist and he explained all the reasons I had troubles with fertility. I had brought all of my own research to the table and he would agree or disagree based on medical evidence. That is when I feel satisfied. When a medical professional will hear me out and not laugh at me for asking about holistic approaches or acupuncture or my internet research. \n\nBut I have to tell you that I trust my OB and my midwife with my life. I trust that they would not brush me off with just statistics and I know that they have years of experience in their field. I know that up until a certain point I was still a normal female of child-bearing age until I we had evidence to support that we had fertility issues. I think the \"trick\" that worked for me was accepting that I have trust in my medical team to make sound decisions WITH me.  All of us had decided together just to give it more time. I understood that in the beginning we just didn't have enough information to say that the CPs were indicative of something off.\n\nI am, in no way, saying that you are like me. You have a completely different genetic makeup and life experiences and 2 chemical pregnancies does not spell out doom for your fertility. Nor am I saying it is nothing, either. What I'm hoping you take away from this response is that you should absolutely continue to seek information. We are no longer at the mercy of \"doctor knows best.\" Keep track of your cycles and take as many pregnancy tests as you want! I pray you will never need to take more than these two chemical pregnancies to a medical professional but if you do then you have saved yourself a lot of time. We have come a long way since women had no technology at the tip of their fingers and a long way since women just accepted their fertility issues with defeat and no explanation. Medical science is a wonderful thing. Use it, honey, and don't feel bad about it. And BTW...Nerds are awesome and we are taking over the world. \n\nTL;DR: Don't stop researching or taking pregnancy tests; those things you do have control over. Trust your medical team to tell you the truth but also trust yourself that you know your body. Just don't self-diagnose.

This CP has been pretty tolerable - very much like a more intense period. Sure, it's more disgusting, but I'm not having hot flashes where sweat drips off my whole body and unbearable pain like the first one so I'm good. I'm going to carry right on exactly as I was before that stick turned positive. I've grocery shopped for this clean eating \"pre-conception\" diet and I'm ready to do it. \n\nI spent some time looking at my medical record yesterday and all of my bloodwork I've had over the past 5-6 years. I consistently have borderline high white blood cell counts, high platelet counts and I once had a high C-reactive protein assay. Taken together, I think I have some chronic, low-grade inflammation in my body. I don't have the worst diet, but it could be better. I read that endometriosis is an inflammatory condition - it makes sense but I didn't put that together. I don't think I have that but I do think a look at my uterine lining would not hurt at this point. \n\nOf course before this CP is over I'd have a plan for moving forward. I think the plan is:  1) keep right on trying (my friend who also had two CPs is lending me her CB Advanced Digital - like the super crazy expensive one!), 2) ask doc about baby aspirin and progesterone for luteal phase or after a positive test, and 3) continue getting ALL the tests. Two CPs in, I'm ready to go all the way with testing...come on. Making women wait for three is just fucking cruel. At least seeing if my tubes and uterus are okay and doing all that Day 3 and Day 21 testing. I've also decided to get rid of all the things I was taking. No more FertileCM (didn't work at ALL), no more Vitex. If I can eat better and lose some weight I guarantee my cycles will normalize. I bought a Fitbit and it came the day the CP started.

Thank you! Thank you for your amazing and reassuring response. First, I am so sorry for all of your losses. From the outside, I bet you being a nurse and having that info did make it both easier and harder. I think that you squarely hit the issue that I'm having trouble with:  I do not feel like I'm working WITH anyone. I feel alone. I feel isolated. I am isolated in my search for information, and isolated in my tracking, temping and charting. My husband has slowly been admitting he googles things. And he asked every day about the lines on the tests. He wants this so bad, but is weary of upsetting me and is also a \"it'll happen when it happens\" kind of guy. But maybe I do feel like I'm sort of working *against* my RE and ob/gyno. I don't know why. I guess because I assume they'll think I don't know anything and they'll try to sweep my worries under the rug. I had such a horrible experience with the RE and I feel like all of the weight is on my shoulders, especially now. I trust modern medicine, I do. Maybe I need to advocate for myself and press my doctors for answers, but once we find answers I think I need to trust and believe those answers instead of never being satisfied with the information put in front of me. I like my doctor a lot and if I have to go back to the RE for more tests, so be it. \n\nAlso it really helps to know that other patients know what's going on with them and it's common to be informed. I guess I have an issue with authority figures in that I want to be respectful and not challenge them but I also want the best care for myself.

My husband and I have been trying to start a family since late summer/early fall 2013. In May 2014, after two months of treatment with IUIs, I became pregnant with our son, Ethan. Ethan died during a delivery at only 22 weeks due to cervical insufficiency. We were crushed. I still mourn my son every morning when I wake up, and every night before info to sleep. \n\nLast spring, after a few cycles of monitoring without treatment at the doc, the ectopics started. I had three. One in April/May of 2015, one in August 2015, and one in December of 2015, which happened spontaneously with no medical intervention while we were waiting for my husband's insurance to cover IVF. It was around that third ectopic that I realized I needed time away from this sub. You all know the sting and the depths of this grief in a way no one else can...but to be stuck with four losses more than a year after my first pregnancy was too much. I had seen too many of you move on because you were lucky enough not to be gifted with both loss and infertility. \n\nThis spring, we finally began IVF. I had an egg retrieval in April that yielded 11 eggs and 5 embryos, 3 of which tested as genetically normal.\n\nIn May, I had surgery to permanently sterilize me so that I couldn't have another ectopic pregnancy. My tubes were scarred, damaged, and full of toxic fluid. I spent Mother's Day this year trying to come to grips with the irony that we were allowing me to become pregnant via IVF by eradicating the chance that I'll ever get pregnant on my own. \n\nIn June, we had our embryo transfer. I've been pumped full of an entire pharmacy's worth of hormones. My lining didn't look great on the day of transfer - but it didn't look great the cycle I conceived Ethan, either. I tried to stay zen by watching Bob Ross on Netflix and seeking support from the fabulous people at r/infertility. \n\nAnd now - I'm 5 weeks, 3 days pregnant. \n\nhttps://imgur.com/9IJCRyp\n\nThat little dot brought on so many tears this Friday. \n\nThis will be a difficult pregnancy, with many, many hurdles to overcome. Weekly monitoring. Progesterone injections through the entire nine months. A cerclage surgery. Probably bed rest and/or limited activity. Lots and lots of fear. \n\nI hope you're prepared to hold my hand through this as I get to know you all again and become reacquainted with some old friends.

My son James was stillborn in December, I'd like to share some advice with you but please, take what helps and leave what doesn't.\n\nI was terrified of what I'd see when I saw my son for the first time, he was premature and so small. And he was beautiful, and I promise your daughter will be beautiful beyond words too. It's the most heartbreaking thing in the world when that baby comes out and there is just silence, but it was also very peaceful for us. There was so much love in that room. As awful at the situation was, we were still so happy to meet out son, see who he looked like. The thought of leading up to that moment is terrifying but I promise actually seeing your daughter won't be so scary, she's your little girl.\n\nI strongly recommend taking lots of photographs. Ones with just baby, ones with just mum and baby, just you and baby and ones as a family. You may never look at them again but trust me, not having those memories if you decide you need them is so painful. If she has hair, keep a lock. Get hand and foot prints taken, casts of her hands and feet if possible. You can bathe her and dress her. At full term you could potentially spend two days holding your daughter with the aid of a cold cot if your hospital has one. We said goodbye after 14 hours as our son was very small at 1lb 5oz. \n\nEveryone grieves differently, just be there for each other. Try your best to communicate, it seemed to me sometimes like my husband didn't grieve our son at all which upset me, he of course did grieve just very privately. Your wife will probably wrongly blame herself for this. I know I did and no one could tell me otherwise, she will need a lot of patience love and support just the same as you need that. Please don't hide your grief to protect her, you can't hurt her anymore than she is already hurting. \n\nPlease message me any time and I hope your wife can maybe come visit us if she feels able to. I hope her labour is quick and smooth, it's a terrible thought having to birth a sleeping baby but honestly, I enjoyed my labour and it was the last thing I could do for my son and it was only me who could do that for him.

If you read this before you leave the hospital, I recommend having someone bringing you a special blanket for to wrap the baby in, or go get one from the gift shop.  When you leave, have your wife hold that blanket, or anything. Leaving the hospital empty-armed is incredibly hard.  If you don't have anyone there to wait with her while you go get the car, see if there is a kind nurse or someone who can wait with her in the lobby.  I'm afraid the toughest part begins once you get home.  Encourage her to be gentle with herself, let her cry if she needs to, and let her know that you two set all of the boundaries for the time being.
