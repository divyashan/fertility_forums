I hope this will be the year of happiness and success after loss for all of us. I really appreciate everyone's support and stories, you all make this a little bit easier to bear. \n\nToday is a hard day. It's been shitty since Christmas. I try my best to be positive, an optimist, I love being happy and celebrating big and small things, but it's been so fucking hard.\n\nI cried on Christmas Eve, because I was wearing some shitty dress that I didn't like, and not the turquoise maternity one I'd chosen the morning of the day my water broke. I cried because I wasn't a glowing, pregnant woman but a grieving, broken not-quite-mother. \n\nI cried on Saturday last, because that was my viability date. I was in paradise with turtles and dolphins, and I cried my eyes out because my body failed my family and I couldn't find anything to celebrate on that day that I was so looking forward to. \n\nI cried tonight at my in-laws New Year's Eve party, because at midnight, my husband's cousin, who is sweet and wonderful and all that, announced her pregnancy. I'm still crying. I tried my best to hold it together, I went into the bathroom and tried to get my eyes to look less red and shiny, but it didn't work. I'm upstairs now feeling like shit. I hope she doesn't feel bad, and I'd like to tell her no hard feelings, but I can't keep it together. I'm supposed to be the one avoiding the cold cuts and booze. Instead I'm drunker than I want to be, crying in bed, feeling some seriously painful self loathing.\n\nMy parents live in a different hemisphere, but I called them anyway and cried some more. I don't know what I'd do without them. My husband noticed that I'd disappeared, and he held me for a while, but he had to go back down to his relatives before they wondered where he was. \n\nI feel sad, broken and empty. I haven't even gotten a period yet, just weird discharge and perma-PMS. I hate my body these days. Why aren't I pregnant anymore? Why isn't it telling me that it is fertile? I think I'm just going to forget the party. My nose and eyes are swollen and I am suddenly really exhausted and just don't care what anyone thinks of my anti-social behaviour.\n\n\n\n\n\n", "controversiality": 0, "created_utc": 1420093137, "distinguished": null, "gilded": 0, "id": "cnb0lbc", "link_id": "t3_2qwiy8", "nest_level": 1, "parent_id": "t3_2qwiy8", "reply_delay": 80200, "retrieved_on": 1425120369, "score": 2, "score_hidden": false, "subreddit": "ttcafterloss", "subreddit_id": "t5_34scd"}, {"author": "SansaScully", "author_created_utc": 1406227887, "author_flair_css_class": "", "author_flair_text": "Mod - missing Oliver, TFMR @ 27wks 8/14", "author_fullname": "t2_hk1cj", "body": "I'm so so sorry :( I've been there - all of the thoughts and feelings you described.

Like I can't fully talk about it without telling the truth about what happened, but my husband doesn't want to share because he's worried about people judging us. I just feel like there's so much stigma around it, and maybe if I share my story, I could help people understand why it happens, and maybe help other women be more comfortable discussing it. And if any of my friends or family disagree with my decision, I'd like to know - so I can cut those people out of my life. But I have to respect that my husband is uncomfortable with it. Maybe someday I'll tell people, but for now I'll just talk about it anonymously online.
