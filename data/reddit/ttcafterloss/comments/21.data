I am still trying really hard.  Unfortunately, it seems like we get  chance DAILY to practice the advice I was given a week ago on here.\n\nI know the parents and relatives thing can be hard.  My mom had a field day with me last year while we were waiting.  She has had a loss herself and knows I have endometriosis and had been told it may be impossible to get preggers.  She'd go on and on about how she moved to be near my sister since she knew I \"hated children\" but at the same time, she also would demand to know when I was \"giving her grandchildren\".  For us, this was really upsetting.  My husband and I *do* have kids as he has two from a prior marriage.  We've had a complicated custody situation since forever since his ex moved out of state without prior authorization and since we both work, a 7 hour round trip is not something either of us could do every week or mid-week.  It's been expensive and very long and tiring to fight. She's aware of this.  And she would say things like, \"those aren't really my grandkids\" which was very harmful.  I can understand her feeling like that but it's not okay to say that to someone.\n\nI would basically tell her if she started in, I would hang up the phone. Before our wedding last year, my husband and I basically asked everyone to shut up about babies because we knew we would not have the kids there on our wedding day and it was really bothering my husband.  In the meantime, we were waiting to try because I was finishing up my dissertation. People, surprisingly, responded well.\n\nHowever, post-wedding, things have gone back to stupid questions.  I posted about easter on here recently - where some extended family are KNOWN to do what your brother is doing.  We have since decided to have our own thing an spend time together knowing that I'm still not 100%.  But we also are 100% on board for future social occasions with saying \"we just had a miscarriage, so if you'd please respect our needs at this time for some distance from the kids issue, that'd be great\".  And for the normal \"don't you want kids\" question or \"won't you regret not having them\", we just had the best answer MADE for us on House of Cards last night.  We will retort \"Do you regret having children?\".  Another plan we have is to have another set of plans.  \"I have a headache.  Can you take me to get coffee?\" during a big family event is the best we've come up with.  It's totally believable.\n\nIt's so insensitive and it's not okay.
