How long the grief process takes, and how our losses mean that future pregnancies will come with anxiety.  (A few days after our loss, I wrote to my family about the details of our son's diagnosis and how it unfolded--he had something that usually can't be diagnosed by ultrasound--everything develops, but doesn't work properly---and my (also) pregnant sister replied, \"Nothing about that scares me.\"  Um....yeah.  Uh-huh.  Sure.)\n\nA lot of us--especially those with rarer, later losses--feel like there will be no point in future pregnancies where we feel like our babies are \"safe.\"  But I think your circumstances are particularly tough.  A 2nd trimester loss, the nature of pPROM, the statistics for recurrence...  Your worries are rational.  \n\nGive yourself a pat on the back for taking things day by day and not pushing yourself to feel a certain way when you don't.   Grief while also TTC isn't easy.   \n\nOne thing that helped me is after I researched the sh*t out of various risks/decisions for any future pregnancies, there wasn't much more my worrying could do for me at this point, so I kind of put \"pregnancy stuff\" in a mental box, and put it on a shelf.  Right now, I'm just thinking about TTC.  If/when I get a BFP, I'll take \"month 2\" worries out of the box, and handle them, and so on.  I'm outsourcing those worries to future months.

For what it\u2019s worth, in my last pregnancy I caught a miserable stomach bug around 17 weeks. Coming out both ends, couldn\u2019t keep anything down.

As soon as I was checked in, I worriedly asked the nurse if my baby was okay\u2014 she assured me that they tend to not be affected by these kinds of illnesses\u2014 they still take what they need from Mom while she feels miserable, but did Doppler me just to reassure me. I think the general feeling on viruses during pregnancy is that they rarely affect a fetus, with the exception of like, the flu or something with a dangerously high fever, so that\u2019s probably why they didn\u2019t seem overly concerned on the phone. However, if YOU are overly concerned and feel like being seen would be in your best interest, then push for that.
