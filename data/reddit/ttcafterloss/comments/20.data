There may be something to the \"wait to ensure you have built up a lining for a baby to implant into\", but if you have a period, I think it's safe to say that you've done so--otherwise you wouldn't have one.

I am not a doctor, but this seems to be in line with what your doctor said. \n\nPersonally, my period came exactly 4 weeks after my surgery, and the second 29 days after the first, so I went back to normal immediately. This is NOT the case for everyone: some peoples luteal phase changes length. I imagine this could cause strife when trying again if you were unsure of how far you should be along (I know I'd be terrified of the baby was measuring small, even if it might be because dates were off since my system changed). For that reason, I wanted to be certain I was back to normal.\n\nNew science shows you have a good chance in the months right after a miscarriage. So if your first period comes along without a hitch, you're emotionally ready, and you have your doctor's blessing, then go ahead and try after that first period.

We were also supposed to BD yesterday and we didn't!!! It was like pulling teeth with DH, like reminding him over and over to get a chore done. So I decided to not nag him, he knows. Well he decided to \"forget\" until it was \"too late\". And I was like whatever I don't want to have sex with him anymore either. Come on that one day we got.\n\nSo what now???? Am I ovulating today?? If so we haven't freaking had sex in three days. All that sex before, carefully never more than one day missed and NONE OF IT will be in the fertile window. I finally get the +OPK and NOTHING, no BD. That's assuming of course that I ovulate at all. Because maybe I won't. Why would I?!?! Why WOULD we get a chance to be pregnant???\n\n\n*sobs*\n\nEdit: after more restless sleep I wake up at my normal time and my temp jumped over 1.2*F. Probably not accurate.

I've had to keep a stash of almonds on hand during the day and walnuts next to my bed. It's nuts!\n\nI think the hunger is a combination of the pregnancy and this damn gluten-free diet I've been on for the past 2 weeks. The other night I dreamt of eating pizza! The naturopath suggested gluten is associated with ADHD, thyroid issues, and miscarriage (all of which apply to me) so I've eliminated it from my diet just in case. Whatever gives this pregnancy the best chance of producing a healthy baby, I'll do. I've noticed my head is slightly clearer (thoughts are slightly more organised) and I haven't miscarried (yet) so maybe it's working. I'm highly dubious but am giving it a go.\n\nThe other day I was chatting to a work colleague over drinks (I had a soda water with lime) and I'm not even sure how we got on the topic but he asked if we had trouble conceiving which is usually a question I'd feel uncomfortable answering, but he's a good person and he was genuinely curious and concerned. So I said, \"we had no problem whatsoever with our son, but we've struggled to have a second one. I can get pregnant, I just can't stay pregnant.\" And it didn't feel weird to say that to a man in his 50's who is most comfortable talking about beer and racing cars, not fertility. He was really kind about it and the conversation wasn't at all awkward. I had only previously disclosed this to other women or men whose partners had experienced a loss, so it was new territory and it was fine.\n\nMaybe I'm getting more comfortable talking about it. Maybe I've healed more than I realised. Maybe this pregnancy has given me hope. \n\nAt what point were you guys comfortable talking about your losses? Who did you speak to apart from us here?

For example, some women may test at 10am and get a close to positive, but not all the way positive test. Then at 6pm, it will be positive. Or at 6pm it could be negative and had the person tested at 2pm, it would have been positive. Last month was my first month and I had a surge for 3 days so I don't think I'm at risk for missing it, which means there's no real reason for me to test multiple times per day. Some women have found their surge is short so they test more often. A good rule is to test at 10am or 2pm (most of what I've read says early afternoon is best and when most surges happen) every day until the line is getting darker and closer to positive. Then if you're worried about missing, you could test more than once per day. I went through 50 Wondfos last cycle because 1) my cycles are long as shit and 2) I'm insane. I did NOT need to test as much as I did. I'd say once a day after holding your pee for several hours is a great start til you're getting close to O and line is getting darker. Good luck! Stay sane!

It's hard for me to speak to what's going through his head because I'm obviously very much the opposite. I have been involved since the beginning (2011) and am more involved than ever now. I actually need to tone down my level of interest in the minutiae of my wife's cycle in order to avoid causing her undue stress.\n\nMy only advice is to ask him directly how he feels about everything. If he is on the same page but is just the sort of person that processes and handles these things differently, I think the two of you may need to find a way to come to grips with that together. People process differently and that's ok. Take my wife and I, for instance: I need to talk about my son and am very open about our experiences. She, on the other hand, needs privacy and space to deal with the complex emotions of loss and infertility. We have talked enough to know we are on the same page and to know that we need to approach this differently. She lets me be as open as I need to be and talk about my son as much as I want here and I let her have her space and just hold her when she needs me.
