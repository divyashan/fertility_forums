I found out I had a MMC on wednesday. Because I didn't really want to take time off work this week the doctor prescribed misoprostol for me to apply at home when I felt comfortable doing so, so I'm doing it tonight when I go to bed. That way I'll have the weekend to deal with this. But I'm sad and angry and scared and I don't really know what to expect. I know I'll cramp and I'll bleed but I've never really had painful periods so I don't know how painful these cramps will be. I also have friends who live abroad visiting this week and I was looking forward to giving them good news, and I won't be able to and it just makes me sad.", "created_utc": 1567787165, "gildings": {}, "id": "ez9pi9u", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_d0damw", "locked": false, "no_follow": true, "parent_id": "t3_d0damw", "permalink": "/r/ttcafterloss/comments/d0damw/ttcafterloss_daily_discussion_thread_1_september/ez9pi9u/", "retrieved_on": 1567787177, "score": 1, "send_replies": true, "steward_reports": [], "stickied": false, "subreddit": "ttcafterloss", "subreddit_id": "t5_34scd", "total_awards_received": 0}, {"all_awardings": [], "author": "pr0gr4mm1ng89800", "author_flair_background_color": null, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_template_id": "ce4ab51a-711f-11e4-826c-12313d148545", "author_flair_text": "1 MMC @ 7w2d", "author_flair_text_color": "dark", "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_vi9pjvh", "author_patreon_flair": false, "body": "I started feeling ok around week 11, started bleeding like crazy, where it was discovered I have a large subchorionic hematoma... so back to not feeling safe.

If not, push for it harder. It might be hard to walk in there again and ask for the tests, and you might feel crummy after any rude comments, but you'll feel a lot better once you do get the testing. And you never know - she may be more receptive after another CP.\n\nThat being said, I'm not sure she knows what she's talking about. CPs CAN be caused by structural issues, according to my OB. If the blasocyst can't implant properly due to a septum in your uterus or polyps, then it can absolutely cause a CP. A 3D ultrasound was the first test my OB ordered for me.\n\nI'm sorry you're going through this again. It's so, so hard.

I thought I was waiting to ovulate but when I got 7 days in a row of super positive OPKs, I took a HPT and, miraculously, there was a BFP.  On what I thought was CD16.  &gt;!I went to my RE for an ultrasound today and there was a yolk sac measuring 5 weeks.  This is really strange and makes no sense with my charting.  I had a cycle start on 7/25 and then what I thought was my next cycle with medium-light bleeding from 8/20-8/24.  I had a BFN on 8/19.  Since the yolk sac is 5 weeks, that bleeding could not have been my period.  Which means this positive happened some time during the 7/25 cycle.  I thought I ovulated on 8/6 but with the size of the yolk sac, it should be closer to 8/16.  So there are two possibilities: either I ovulated later than I thought and have a healthy 5 week pregnancy and had some random spotting, or I got pregnant earlier than that and I'm going through a miscarriage and the yolk sac stopped growing around 5 weeks.  Based on a LMP of 7/25, I should be around 6.5 weeks.  I'm going to go in next Friday for another ultrasound and hope I see 6 week size and a heartbeat but I'm expecting, instead, my third MMC in one year.!&lt;\n\nI feel pretty pessimistic but I won't know anything until next week.
