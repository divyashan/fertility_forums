I am currently almost 12 weeks along. We wanted to try again fairly quickly after, but didn't think it would happen right away.

I don't know as much as others here, but hope this still helps you some and am open to answer any questions, if you have any, as best I can. I would recommend giving yourself some extra time to heal emotionally if you are able to put off trying again. Personally, I needed more time to recover from the emotional trauma of my loss.

He had moved way to the back of my uterus. Poor husband was silently freaking out in the corner, I could hear movement on the Doppler and the doctor kept zooming the probe around so quickly that she kept moving from the heartbeat (I could hear it for .2 seconds before she zoomed off it again like wtf lady!). I knew he was alive, I knew what I was hearing but husband didn't and thought he had died. Eek these appointments aren't helping his mental state but I can hardly advise him not to come. The doctor was very kind and reassuring though and spent around 15 minutes just telling us again and again that we can come in every day if we need to for heartbeat checks if it helps us through. She was so sincere and wished she could help, she tried to suggest some support routes and was surprised when I told her that our hospital and area didn't offer any bereavement support.

I just laid around, popping pain pills, and eating and watching GG. It was nice, but I'm unsure how to transition back to my hectic work schedule. \n\nHusband and I had a good talk about plans for TTC last night. He's so ready. He said with confidence this would be our last holiday without a baby so he's going to enjoy it. He's so sure we're on our way now. Wish I had a dose of some of that optimism. Maybe I'll allow a little bit of it. I'm just not sure how to temper the TTC crazy. Ah well I'm still under instructions of \"nothing in the vagina for 2 weeks\" so I have some time!

It was kind of a weird session. \n\nSo, I don't really use therapy to try and get \"better\", I more or less use it to stay well. Over the years, I've built up a really strong repertoire of self-care, self-soothing, radical self-acceptance, and courage to reach out. Therapy is part of my self-care routine. I've come to love and accept my mental illness and I don't see it as part of me that \"needs fixing\". I'm really, really, really okay with being depressed. I'm functioning at a level that I feel is really acceptable, I've been able to deal with traumas in more or less constructive ways, I don't live anywhere near the ridiculous self-destructive lifestyle that I used to live, I've cultivated amazing relationships that offer me a lot of support, and so on and so on. I'm sad but I'm also pretty resilient and self-aware and able to accomplish (most) of the things I set my mind to.\n\nAnyway... My therapist has been trying to get me to think about \"treatment goals\" with her. To be honest, I think she finds it a little bit boring to just be a sounding board and someone I can confide in. She's done all this training in cool modalities of therapy and she wants to flex her muscles. And I have no problem with that, definitely not. I just told her that she'll, y'know, have to take the lead. In particular, she thinks that sensorimotor psychotherapy might be a helpful modality. This therapy deals a lot with how we experience emotions and memories within our body, and especially with how we told trauma in our body. I've had a lot of traumas in my life, let's do it. \n\nSo she shows me this little line graph thing that explains how there's an optimal zone of stimulation/arousal, and on either side of it there's hyperarousal (anxiety and friends) and hypoarousal (depression and friends). And the goal is to widen the gap between the hyper- and hypoarousal to create a larger optimal zone. When she's talking about hyperarousal, she keeps using the example of getting into a car crash. And I'm just sitting there, nodding, mmhmming, thinking to myself \"Yes, I know all about this. This whole fucking spectrum has been happening to me for over a week now.\" \n\nAnyway, we agreed that it could be helpful somehow for her to use more of these techniques in our sessions, and then I proceeded to spew the past 2 weeks events and cry a lot. \n\nI was honestly OK until I started talking about my car. That was when I lost it. And it feels a bit silly that I can be so detached and clinical about the loss of a pregnancy, but as soon as I talk about losing my 2001 Acura, all bets are off. \n\nGrief is weird, y'all.
