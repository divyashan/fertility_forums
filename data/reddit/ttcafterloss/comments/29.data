On Monday I'll finally be 37 weeks and at our goal so I won't feel guilty about wanting the baby to come. Ive been ready for him for a couple weeks now, but feel bad about wanting him to come now since it is still early. I want him to be as healthy as possible when he's born, but I also want to be able to stop worrying that my body is going to screw everything up when we are right at the end or that one of the (many) complications we've been dealing with the entire pregnancy is finally going cause some serious issues. In my mind the sooner he is born the sooner he will be out of harms way from my body being effed up, and I won't have to worry constantly if he's making his kick counts and if the spotting I'm still having is normal and if the cramps are contractions or something wrong. I dunno, but regardless when Monday rolls around I'm done feeling guilty about wanting him out now, and hopefully I can be excited when I start having contractions instead of wanting them to stop like I've been the past month. I think dh is tired of me talking about wanting the baby to come now. He is dead set on wanting to make it to 40 weeks because the guys he works with apparently told him that the longer the baby cooks the better, so even though he's technically full term he thinks his health will be affected if he's born now so he's all about the bed rest. Since walking can bring on contractions he's being weird even about me walking the dog. Ugh. I say it all the time but as grateful and thankful as I am to be pregnant and to have a healthy baby and be this far along, I hate actually being pregnant. I feel like some women thrive when they're pregnant; they're always happy and bubbly and theyre just built to be pregnant. But I'm not one of them.. I'm constantly sick and tired and sore. And did I mention sick? The last few weeks have not treated me well. I really am trying to stay positive and optimistic but after being pregnant 15 of the past 17 months, I'm just really really ready to have the baby here healthy/safe, and to not feel sick anymore. I'm so tired of always being sick, I can deal with the rest just not the constant temperature changes, nausea, headaches, pains, etc. I mean, is it normal to feel so shitty all of the time? Does anyone else feel like this? What if this isn't the pregnancy that's making me feel so bad and there's some underlying issue that means I'm not going to feel any different once the babys born? I'm literally uncomfortable in my own skin I want to crawl out and take a break from feeling for just five minutes. Maybe I'm just a big baby when it comes to pregnant and it's side effects. Blah.

At almost 37 weeks, I've been getting bad cramping very low, like in my lower pelvic region. It feels like it's in 'the front' instead of in the middle or down at the bottom by cervix. Sort of where period cramps are at except a little lower and more..idk..forward? When I went into preterm labor at the hospital the contractions were felt all over my stomach,.. upper, middle, lower and in my back, hips, and joints. Also these new cramps feel more constant and consistent. When I was induced with Peyton when I lost her at 25 weeks I had an epidural so early I barely felt any pain or contractions at all so I really don't know what yo expect. Is this new pain just contractions? Like my body getting ready for the real thing? The baby dropping? Dilation? Braxton Hicks? They aren't all the time or anything they come and go throughout the day. They're just a lot different than what I've been experiencing and I'm curious if anyone else has or is feeling anything like this. \n\nAlso, how the heck do I know if the baby has dropped? I carry low to begin with so its hard to tell or maybe I just haven't yet.. When the midwife was checking to see if I was dilated she said i was 1cm and that she was able to feel the top of the baby's head. I lost part of? My mucus plus already and have had spotting, and he was head down at our 35w ultrasound but they didn't say if he was engaged or anything. I still feel kicks near my ribs and have pain near my lungs and trouble breathing, but I'm also having a more difficult time walking and I'm waddling more/having a tougher time getting around.

The one year anniversary of my daughter's death was two days ago and while I wont say it gets better, I was able to carry the grief with me and learned how to better cope with it all. \nDon't let anyone tell you that you should be over this at any point either. Making people understand about my grief and Marin's short life has helped me immensely. \nSending you lots of love and hugs.

They've only done it whenever I've had growth scans. After that, to get the baby's estimated weight at birth they take the baby's weight at the time of the growth scan and add a half a pound per week (the average that the baby is putting on weight at this point). Its actually pretty inaccurate from what I've heard and read about. But my mil ways asks all kinds of detailed questions too and expects me to know the answer like \"how's the baby doing, what does he weigh, what was he measuring, is he measuring ahead, what position was he in\" after just a regular check up like you were describing (Doppler, measuring the uterus, cervical check). She apparently thinks they always do ultrasounds or something when in reality they rarely do them. We had our last one at 35 weeks and that's probably it for us. It just gets annoying like she expects me to know how the baby is doing.. Like I heard his heartbeat, that's it. I can't base how my baby is doing based on a heartbeat. There could be something seriously wrong and his heart rate is still going to be normal. People think because he is in my stomach that I always know how he is doing and stuff. If I did, I wouldn't have lost my daughter And it wouldn't have taken days to realize something was wrong.  I know, I'm cynical. It's just frustrating to me when my family is constantly asking me how the baby is and for all these details and I don't know. I would love to know exactly how the baby is doing. But I don't, and no matter how much it bothers my MIL that I can't reassure her that the baby is OK, I promise it bothers me 100x more. Constantly reminding her that I don't always know how the baby is, is nothing but a reminder to me about how much I lack control over the entire situation.

You're so close, I would definitely lose it if I found out they were canceling the c-section. Is it weird to say I hope your placenta is still in the same place? Haha.
