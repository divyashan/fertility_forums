I submitted some questions about it to /r/BehavioralMedicine and got a really nice reply from a mod there. You can see it here: https://www.reddit.com/r/BehavioralMedicine/comments/3f03tb/depression_during_pregnancy/ctkh37s (sorry for formatting; I'm on my phone).\n\nI think Tina's idea of asking your hospital for suggestions on support groups or therapists is a great one. I know my hospital has posters everywhere about depression being the most common maternal side effect of pregnancy/delivery and advice on how to get help. It can be scary to make that first call for help; I basically bawled through the voicemail I left when I reached out to a counselor for help. But the counseling did really help a lot.\n\nIf you'd like, you can PM me your general location or closest hospital, and I'll be happy to do some preliminary Internet research on what your hospital/community offers in terms of support. \n\nThere is hope. You can make it through this. Please do keep checking in here to update us; you have a whole bunch of us rooting for you!

Staying pregnant is another matter entirely. \n\nI've undergone so many tests: a bunch of recurrent miscarriage blood screening tests (they took like 8 vials of blood), thyroid tests, immunology tests, celiac screening, gynaecological ultrasound. And everything looks fine. The nurse who did the ultrasound mentioned my ovaries are polyfollicular (a lesser version of polycystic), but she said that isn't worth worrying about. My gynaecologist said to keep trying, as did the GP who did my skin cancer screening today (all clear btw) so although we were both tired we gave it a red hot go and really enjoyed ourselves.\n\nWe don't have the semen analysis back yet so that's the big question mark. We'll get the results Friday. Because of the millions and millions of sperm, they can't all be bad, right? I just hope if there are a few screwy swimmers, one of the good ones will make it through this time.\n\nWhen I had the ultrasound the other day the nurse pointed out the egg which was about to be released and I got weirdly attached to that little egg.
