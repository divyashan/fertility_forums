I really want to TTW again this coming cycle, but I'm feeling conflicted about it. For one thing, I won't be getting my TSH tested for another 2.5 weeks--if I get my period today, it will be CD 18 when I go for my blood test. (My doctor wanted me to wait six weeks after changing prescriptions--she wants to see my TSH under 2.) I don't usually ovulate until CD 19 or 20, and this last cycle was CD 29, so theoretically there could be time to use the fertile period if I do find out my TSH is normal. But morally, I wonder if TTW without knowing if we're giving a baby the best possible chance at life is fair...even though both my family doctor and OB said that if I did get pregnant, we'd monitor things very closely.\n\nThe other reason, which I posted about a couple days ago, is that there's some issues with our health insurance right now, and while we technically do have coverage, there will be lots of phone calls with doctor's offices and labs and billing departments and the provincial health insurance agency whenever I have something done. Which, if I have a lot of early intervention early in a pregnancy (since my OB wants to do early HCG testing, early ultrasounds, etc.--which I'm thrilled about)--could be stressful.

I had three losses before this pregnancy and there is still happiness and excitement and hope, it's unfortunately just a bit muted and guarded this time. It's just the hearts way of protecting itself from more harm, but I found it impossible not to hold out even a little hope for a good outcome this time. The daily chat rooms are a great place to vent and talk about how you are feeling, we've all got different stories but we all understand the pain and worries that come with loss.

Some women love being pregnant, feeling every kick, watching their belly grow and their body changing. Some feel an instant connection and strong feelings of love towards to their child the minute they see a positive pregnancy test. I not one of those people.\n\nI'm trying to appreciate every moment I am pregnant, knowing each day I am pregnant increases our chances of a healthy baby. I envy men for their minimal contribution to bringing a child into this world. Oh to be able to do the deed and then sit back while somebody else does all the hard work for nine months! \n\nI'm just exhausted. Not only because I'm nearing the third trimester (25+6) but because I've been pregnant for pretty much the past year and a half with six week breaks in between losses. I want to be able to drink a glass of wine, go for a long run, not pee when I sneeze, and lean over without my sciatic nerve freaking out. To be fair, the past 10 weeks have flown by and the second trimester has been blissful, but it's only going to get more uncomfortable from here. I just have to suck it up for the next 14 weeks.\n\nOnce baby is here the real work begins, but even though that is more exhausting than pregnancy, it's something I enjoy. I don't mind changing nappies, breastfeeding in the wee hours of the morning, and rocking baby to sleep all day long. All that effort is rewarding when you can see that little person looking back at you. \n\n(TW: living child) I'm still struggling to connect with that little person inside of me. Baby still seems like an abstract idea and not yet something concrete. I felt the same way with my son. When he was born my husband fell in love instantly, but I wasn't able to open my heart so readily so somebody I didn't even know. Over the course of the next three months as we got to know each other I came to love him more than anybody in the world. He is the most wonderful little guy and every day I marvel at how lucky we are to have him in our lives. I just want to fast forward to the part where I can get to know this baby and avoid all this pregnancy stuff.
