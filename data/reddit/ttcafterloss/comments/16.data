I have been trying to be more helpful to you ladies (and dudes) too, i promise i'll cut it down &lt;3\n\nThis weekend was awesome because since my sister got engaged I barely thought about my dysfunctional uterus. Score there! Few interesting things happened however, my sis's new in laws told me about a real sloppy mess of a girl we know who found out that OOPS SHE'S 3 MONTHS PREG! And it's a healthy boy... because of course it is :-| She's got my due date and when we were on the beach back in September and I was a few weeks along she was telling me how she's psychic and all about when i'd have kids. LOLZ SHE WAS JUST READING HERSELF. woo sa. \n\nSomething small that has been irritating me: now that my in laws (who have NEVER had a preg loss) know about my mc they're super sympathetic and I do appreciate it, but my MIL says \"whenever you want to talk about it i'm here\" so I mentioned it just because it happened to fit in the conversation and she quickly told me that i needed to move on o_0 It's ok, maybe she's uncomfortable, i'll let that slide. Then yesterday at my sister and her new fiance's engagement gathering at my parents, my FIL decided that was the perfect time to talk to me about it. He told me it's not my time. I don't know why this bothers me. Maybe because I'm a person of little faith and I get upset when people try and tell me that my life is some big plan. I just hate that. It didn't work out and yes I beg God for a pregnancy often but I just feel like it was bad luck. I dunno. Bad timing for my FIL to tell me at a party i guess. A simple \"I'm sorry\" would have been the best. I know that's awful and I'm really sorry if that's offensive or depressing but am I alone here? Like for example, when my husband told MIL, she called me and went on an on about how she has faith that it will happen and believes that this wasn't the right time. I couldn't even get sad on the phone. I just wanted to be like \"eh, maybe i'm going to just give up. Whose plan is that?\"\n\nSorry for the wall.

I know pregnant women aren't fragile little humans that can't do anything but I was still lifting 50-60 pounds at 38 weeks and  I was under way to much stress at the end of my pregnancy because the store manager was an asshole who didn't give two shits that I was pregnant, he didn't find a replacement for me and So I was doing my full job up until I finally went of leave 4 days before my due date because I just had enough. I feel like if I wasn't under so much stress that maybe my body would have gone into labor sooner and maybe Amaryllis would be here.\n\nLuckily that store manager got fired and isn't there anymore. I've also had a talk with management and was very blunt with them that I blame them, that i plan on getting pregnant again and they won't be able to treat me like they did with this last pregnancy, I won't give two shits, as soon as the BFP shows up my give a fuck meter goes to zero and if it ends up being in any way like it was last time, I'll quit.

I could force myself to go out and get one and set it up and put decorations on, but I won't be happy while doing it and that just seems more depressing. I'd rather put it off, or not do it at all. Christmas is my favorite holiday but right now I'm OK skipping everything, except I have to buy gifts.\n\nBack to work today, to my job I don't like and was looking forward to quitting in the summer to stay home with a baby.", "controversiality": 0, "created_utc": 1448891718, "distinguished": null, "gilded": 0, "id": "cxhvse6", "link_id": "t3_3utmtb", "nest_level": 1, "parent_id": "t3_3utmtb", "reply_delay": 24591, "retrieved_on": 1450119264, "score": 6, "subreddit": "ttcafterloss", "subreddit_id": "t5_34scd"}, {"author": "greenmangosfool", "author_created_utc": 1430017502, "author_flair_css_class": "", "author_flair_text": "Dad TTC #1 - missing Walker - 3/15, 19 wks", "author_fullname": "t2_n4ntf", "body": "Firstly, you don't post too much here - I don't know that that's even a thing, because you can and should post as often as you want and need to.

You are just insinuating there is someone sitting up there in the sky saying, \"eh....woopsie, made a mistake. i THOUGHT it was the right time, but fuck, I made a mistake\" - which, then, logically leads down to the slippery slope of \"it happened for a reason.\" Fuck that shit. Also, I'd like to point out that it *was* the right time for countless drug addicts or women who've already had 8 babies and don't want another one because they don't have access to birth control...I can go on and on.

They did have a scheduling snafu - they wrote Monday Nov 24 (Monday was, of course, Nov 23). Still let me give the sample without too much drama. It was awkward, but alright. I'll update once I get the results.\n\nMy wife's HSG was scheduled for Mon at 3:45. However, the genius at the radiology lab managed to schedule it for Friday, which is the day my wife called, *NOT* the day she was attempting to schedule the appointment for. So when we show up, they tell her that she was a no show for her Friday appointment and that they can't fit her in, either Monday or the next two days - this means she would entirely miss the window this cycle. So my wife, who is already stressed and embarrassed beyond all belief, starts crying there in the waiting room. They finally figure out it was their mistake and tell her to come back Tuesday and they will fit her in. They apologized, but they are on my shit list.\n\nSo she went back Tuesday and the procedure was incredibly painful for her. They let me go back in the room with her, and I stood behind a lead wall with a window in it. I wished I could have been there holding her hand. The doc hasn't discussed the results with her yet but...it didn't go well. It looks like her right tube is blocked. So now, on top of nearly 5 years trying, a second trimester loss, and PCOS, she has a blocked tube to deal with. Fuck the universe.\n\nWe know doc will want to discuss the results with her and this hasn't happened yet, but we do have a plan in place that will hopefully make us less miserable and allow us to just start being us again.\n\nMy wife has always been a proponent of adoption, even before we encountered all of these issues, and it fits in very well with who we are. I'm not sure either of us are comfortable with blowing all of our savings for a *chance* at pregnancy by going through IVF when we could give a home to a baby who needs a home with that same money. We are beyond ready to start a family (see approx 5 yrs trying, above), and maybe this is the answer.\n\nNow, that doesn't mean we will \"give up\" on having a biological child at all. We want to continue trying. We will continue meds and/or less costly and invasive medical treatment at doc and/or an RE's recommendation. The hope is that maybe this will take some of the pressure off, allow us to enjoy being us again, start our family while we're still young (we both turn 30 in January). We haven't ruled out the idea of doing an IVF cycle or two in the future in addition to adopting if we haven't been successful in the mean time. \n\nNone of this is set in stone, and we will certainly be listening closely to what doc has to say, but we are both tired of this. I know this answer wouldn't be right for everyone and I would be lying if I said I didn't want one of our own in addition to an adopted little one, but I think this is the right answer for us right now. I'll keep you all updated once we talk to doc and if we decide to go through with it.\n\nOne last note: a big thank you to everyone who posted comments wishing us luck last week. I didn't get back around to replying, for reasons that are hopefully obvious now - I'm sorry, you all deserve individual responses, but it was just too much. This blanket thank you will have to suffice. Sorry for the wall of text, just a lot going on.

I apologize for not responding- I'm trying to deal with the fact that I've lost 2 pregnancies in 5 weeks and I'm feeling pretty numb right now.  \n\nPeople are starting to make me feel like I'm crazy.  For those who may remember for my first CP that it happened at work and I'm close enough with my manager (we share an office) that I told her what was happening when I had to leave work that day.  When it happened again, I told her that it had happened again as the bleeding started at work again.  She asked me more than once if my positive HPTs were just false positives.  I had to explain that false positives, while possible, are rare enough and that I had multiple positives on multiple brands- it wasn't a false positive.  The doctor telling me again at the end of my appointment that it could have just been \"residual microscopic tissue\" from my last pregnancy causing the tests to still register positive, despite me telling him that they were negative on 8DPO and the morning of 10DPO.  Then to get the news that my hcg was only a 6.  I knew the pregnancy was on the way out after having 5 days of the same shade of Wondfo, but I still thought it would be higher than that.  Everything has me questioning my sanity.  Did I make those lines up?  No, I know they were there.  I seriously feel like everyone is just smiling and nodding at me like I'm making this shit up.  I went so far as to bring my positive tests with me to my appointment last Wednesday, but I never brought them out to show to the doctor.  After I do my next blood draw later this week, I'm hoping the doc will want to see me again (after all, we do still need to discuss what happened).  I plan on bringing them with me again along with the negatives I had gotten prior to prove I'm not crazy.  \n\nMy mom lives about an hour and a half away and we went to see her Saturday, stayed the night with her and then my husband and I went to do our annual cutting down of our Christmas tree.  We have 8' ceilings but got a GIGANTIC 8.5' tree anyway (we trimmed the bottom where it was a little thinner).  We had a tree 2 or 3 years ago that I called \"the tree that ate the living room\".  This year's tree takes the cake.  We love it, though.  We both love huge, full, fat trees and that's exactly what it is. :)\n\nI'm becoming more and more resentful of the pregnancy announcements and updates that I see on facebook.  I am past the point of being happy for my \"sister\" who is due in March.  I'm just angry at this point.  I don't even feel bad about it anymore.  I swear if she sends me one more snapchat about her pregnancy I'm going off on her.  She doesn't know about my CP's, but she knows that we've been trying for 5 months and even without the losses, cool it with your pregnancy bullshit.  I don't know, do I tell her what happened and how her posts are hard for me?  We haven't told anyone aside from my manager and my SIL (who lives with us).  For some reason, it's just something I don't know that I want to share with her. \n\nThis turned into a novel again, I'm really sorry.  I just have no one else to talk to about this aside from my husband.
