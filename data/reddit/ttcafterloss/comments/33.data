At some point you realize that it's not a race and it's your *life* and it can go at whatever pace it needs to go and the others around us will be having their kids go through teen years while we're still enjoying babies and younger children at fun stages. There's pros and cons to having them in our 20s vs 30s. I've come to a point of peace with it but hell its taken me over a year! Some of my friends that aren't even married/with an SO yet as we reach our mid thirties are freaking out too, understandably. They're like \"at least you're at a point where you're trying\" and I want to be like \"oh fuck you\" but at the same time the anxiety that comes with being in their shoes + wanting to be a mom is overwhelming, I can't imagine. Loss is a devastation like no other, but watching the time tick when you have no options on the near horizon...I wouldn't trade places with them. I feel lucky to be at least TTC sometimes. I have hope that it will happen and when it does it won't erase the pain from the past but I hope hope hope I will say \"this is what I was waiting for, this is why I struggled\" and hope I feel joy at some point. I hope we all do. \n\nI'm here for you waffles - we will get through \u2764\ufe0f\ud83d\udc00", "controversiality": 0, "created_utc": 1479495758, "distinguished": null, "gilded": 0, "id": "da60d0w", "link_id": "t3_5dl511", "nest_level": 2, "parent_id": "t1_da5tnuo", "reply_delay": 8296, "retrieved_on": 1481579140, "score": 2, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "ttcafterloss", "subreddit_id": "t5_34scd"}, {"author": "iswronmemum", "author_created_utc": 1387893692, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_text": null, "author_fullname": "t2_ehuhk", "body": "Apparently she has two lines in one of those strip things.

I was right earlier this year when my pregnancy tests were still positive 7 weeks out and my period hadn't returned but it still took another 4 weeks before they finally figured out that I had retained placenta. And I was right after I did five days of Provera and didn't bleed (everyone kept saying \"Oh, it's because you didn't do the full ten!\" Then why do some research studies use 5 days as their standard protocol?), and I was still right after my second period when it was still super light and that freaked me out, but they were like don't worry, come back in December if you're not pregnant yet. \n\nIt's frustrating because I'm a doctor, and I want people to be able to trust us, but fuck, we make it so hard sometimes. \n\nAnyway, need to go home and make sure my husband isn't on a warpath to sue the ob/gyn who did my D&amp;Cs.
