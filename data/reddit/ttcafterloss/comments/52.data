Everything else appeared healthy for him, so the urologist was positive that once we get the vein removed, it will significantly boost his sperm count within 2-3 months. It could be possible that after we first got pregnant, the varicocele appeared. He explained it's like having varicose veins pop up anywhere else. It's an easy outpatient procedure. I am scheduling it now for him.\n\nHe also suggested we can try Clomid for Men, but he stated it wouldn't be that significant of an increase since his testosterone is good and his main problem is physical, or the varicocele. I think we are going to try it as well just to boost his rates. Like the urologist said, \"there's nothing to lose.\"\n\nSo yay, progress! And fixable progress.

Fuck. This situation is all kinds of messed up and I feel so guilty and don't know what to do.\n\nMy friend and I have barely spoken in the last 15 years but were best of friends for a decade. She had a shitty life, dropped out of school in 10th grade, and has spent most of the time since addicted to drugs, and occasionally prostituting herself to pay for them. She disappears for years at a time, then pops back up for a few months whenever she's trying to get clean. I always try to reconnect with her and support her at those times. \n\nHer most recent appearance was a few months ago, and shortly thereafter she posted a positive pregnancy test on Facebook. My initial thought was \"oh fuck no\". She is not equipped to be a parent. But...she seemed so happy. It seemed to be giving her strength to stay clean. I thought maybe this will be the time that it sticks, maybe this kid won't end up born drug dependent and heading straight to foster care. Maybe. She was due right around the same time I was, but I hadn't told her yet. I didn't trust her to keep my secret, and felt guilty that I knew about her but she didn't know about me. I planned to tell her this week or next, and explain that I didn't want to say anything due to my losses. Then yesterday she posted that she lost the baby.\n\nWe talked and I told her about my losses, and she said she was OK, but I'm sure we've all said that before and not meant it. I worry that she's going to go straight back to drugs. I worry she's going to hate that I didn't tell her about my pregnancy sooner. I don't know how to tell her now. How long do you think I should wait? I'm trying to put myself in her shoes, but I honestly don't know what I would prefer if it were me. At that moment everything hurts so much that I can't imagine anything making the hurt easier.\n\nChanging the subject completely, in some positive news, [my RE made national news](http://www.cnn.com/2017/12/19/health/snowbaby-oldest-embryo-bn/index.html) for transferring an embryo that had been frozen for 24 years and the woman just gave birth to a healthy baby :)", "created_utc": 1513775590, "gildings": {"gid_1": 0, "gid_2": 0, "gid_3": 0}, "id": "driodkm", "link_id": "t3_7kztjh", "parent_id": "t3_7kztjh", "permalink": "/r/ttcafterloss/comments/7kztjh/ttcafterloss_alumni_daily_discussion_thread/driodkm/", "retrieved_on": 1513775592, "score": 7, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "ttcafterloss", "subreddit_id": "t5_34scd", "updated_utc": 1513775592}, {"author": "blackoutz711", "author_created_utc": 1394333327, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_text": "MC14wks | CP, 1 Rainbow", "body": "A fingertip is actually huge!
