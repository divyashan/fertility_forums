Did it help with anything and what brand did you use?\n\nI've used it for 2 years now at a dose of about 6g a day by weight. I get it off Amazon for about $15 and it lasts me about a month and a half. It is in powder form and can be taken in water or tea or whatever. \n\nYou should not take it if you are on birth control trying not to get pregnant because it will over ride it and try to let you ovulate and cycle naturally. Also don't take it while on fertility meds as it interferes with those too. If you are bipolar also be careful because it can cause mania if you are inclined. \n\nBut inositol helps regulate hormones, can help depression and anxiety and helps insulin levels. I take it along with a small dose of metformin and it helps my insulin level stay normal. It also helped lower my estrogen and up my progesterone enough to get pregnant twice naturally even tho I have severe PCOS. \n\nHad to stop talking it when I groot pregnant because it can cause uterine contractions.

Such a wide array of stories and it's lovely to hear how sometimes life just throws you together.\n\nMy husband and I met during college, in March 2006. We met at an ROTC banquet. I had a boyfriend, but was there as the date of a male friend (with the bf's approval of course). We chatted all night and I thought he was cool. I wrote down my email address or name or something, so he could find me on Facebook (he still has this!! Awwww).  He did, then we became good friends. It was pretty obvious to me, and others, that he liked me. But again, I had a boyfriend. Then when I was single, he had a girlfriend so it just didn't occur to me. \n\nThis went on for ~4 years...us being very good friends and even visiting in other states....until we were both single at the same time in winter of 2009.\n\nHe was living in NC and me in IL...he flew home for the holidays and I picked him up at the airport. We spent a whole day together...had some beers, went ice skating, watched a movie, and made dinner. Something about it just felt \"right\". From then on we kind of talked/texted/etc every single day while he was home. I think we were both worried we might ruin our great friendship. Then I convinced him to stay a few extra days and celebrate New Years with me. On New Years day 2010 we both went for it and kissed each other and have been together ever since.   :) \n\nDated 1 year long distance, then I moved to NC. Got engaged December 2012 and married September 2013.
