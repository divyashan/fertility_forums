There are two things I did that I think could have caused it.\n\n1.  **Skin care products.**  I see an esthetician for my acne and she has her own line of skincare products.  I told her I was pregnant as soon as I got my BFP and she assured me all of the products I was using were safe for pregnancy.  I did not do my own research on the ingredients or consult my OB.  The other day my esthetician was trying to comfort me about my miscarriage, and she told me that she has had \"a bunch\" of clients who were pregnant, and about half of them miscarried.  My heart sunk when she said that.  Considering that is far above the average miscarriage rate, I couldn't help but wonder if there was a causal relationship between the products and miscarriage.\n\n\n2.  **Throat Coat Tea.**  I had a really bad cold for a week during my pregnancy.  I wanted to refrain from using any medicine but drink a ton of Throat Coat tea.  Maybe 3-4 cups a day for 4 or 5 days.  I was just reading in a thread here the other day about things not to take/do while pregnant, and licorice was one.  Organic Licorice Root is the first ingredient in that stupid tea.  And there are other herbs that could be bad too, I haven't brought myself to look each of them up.  Of course it says on the tea box to check with a doctor if you are pregnant or nursing, but I assumed that was a boilerplate warning.  Now I feel like it wasn't and I should have listened.\n\n\nObviously what's done is done and feeling like it could have been my fault doesn't help anything.  My mind just keeps ending back here.  Like deep down, I know it was my fault.  I just can't believe how stupid I was to use those products so carelessly, and next time I will be so much more careful.  Ughhhh.

Ive been feeling like I can't handle being pregnant, he thinks I can. We have decided to compromise instead on the whole just wing it, no charting or opks, have sex for fun only thing instead. \n\nThe thing is, at this point, I don't need to do any of that. I have a pretty good idea of when I'm fertile. It's around now, and suddenly, today I feel like I can totally do this, that I'm completely ready to be pregnant again, that I *can* deal with whatever gets thrown my way.\n\nI'm wondering if my confidence is being inspired by hormones, or if I actually don't need to take time off from trying to get pregnant.\n\nEither way, I read something yesterday saying that the type of fibroid that I have (pedunculated submucosal) lowers your chances of implantation by 50% so I have a feeling that I really shouldn't take a month off, because if we haven't managed to conceive in six months of trying, my fibroid should be reassessed and removed. So if we do take time off, that means it will be closer to a year before we will likely be able to conceive again given the recovery time after having the fibroid removed. \n\nI really hope that we can just conceive without removing the fibroid though. The myomectomy makes me nervous, esp. since the one that I had just over a year ago damaged my cervix, and since it will require yet another d&amp;c and I have a fear of Asherman's syndrome after spending too much time on google. \n\nOkay, rambling over, I feel better getting this out.

Firstly any liquorice in that tea would be VERY diluted, so I doubt it had any real effect.

Also in very early pregnancy the fetus is mostly subsisting on a yolk sac anyway, so it's not going to be easily affected by tiny traces of skin products in your blood stream (even assuming they were harmful, which they probably aren't).\n\nAt least 25% of pregnancies end in spontaneous miscarriage and it's nobody's fault. Remember - alcoholics and drug addicts and all sorts of people who abuse their bodies terribly still somehow end up having healthy babies more often than not. If they can do it, I don't think a few cups of liquorice tea and some generally safe skincare products are going to make the difference to whether your pregnancy is healthy.
