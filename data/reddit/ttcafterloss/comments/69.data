That I would have to verbalize why I was there. That some nurses, initially, might not know the situation. I wish someone had mentioned that the laminaria insertion would be fairly uncomfortable, and I would cry because that was it. The whole process was upsetting, honestly. You very well may not have this experience, but I was in an incredible amount of pain before going in for the procedure because the opening of my cervix sent me into labor. The contracting of my uterus caused painful GI issues that lasted about a month after. \n\nThe biggest thing I wish I would have known is that the pain isn't over once the baby is gone. There's a hormone crash about two weeks later. Then you'll get a period and that is so offensive because it just shoves your pain right back into your face on a daily basis. I am sad whenever I drink or eat deli meat. All of the things that remind me I'm not pregnant give me this painful twinge in my chest. \n\nIt's been a slow healing process with plenty of steps back along the way. Right now I'm hung up on needing to be pregnant before my due date comes, but I know it's such an arbitrary deadline and I'm working hard to settle my expectations. Just be prepared for a lot of confusing feelings. \n\nThis is month three for me. My last two cycles were totally screwed up, so be ready to be patient with your body. \n\nIt will be hard, but you will make it through this.\n\nI'm here for any questions you may have.

I started to get a little bit crampy by the time I checked in, about 20 hours after the laminaria, but nothing terrible. When I got into pre-op, they placed an IV and started me on saline and versed for anxiety (I wasn\u2019t that nervous, I just wanted to...not feel, if that makes sense). My husband was able to be with me the entire time until they wheeled me into the OR. The doctor asked me to tell her about my favorite vacation, I said about four sentences, and the anesthesia kicked in. \n\nI\u2019m not good at waking up from anesthesia, and I woke up kind of sobbing (they warned my husband that I was really emotional before bringing him back to see me in recovery). It was really weird to feel empty - I was very aware that there was no more baby (I was just shy of 18 weeks). Physically, my lady parts felt like I\u2019d had rough sex, that\u2019s the best description I can think of. Honestly that pain didn\u2019t last long for me. \n\nThey made me stay in recovery until I drank some water and ginger ale (I was super dehydrated). They walked me to the bathroom, I was bleeding but not any more than a heavy period. Then I went home (with some prescription strength ibuprofen). I was groggy on the drive home (about an hour) but felt normal tired by the time we got back. I ate a bland dinner and watched some comfort tv. The next day, I woke up feeling 100% normal. I went shopping and had a therapy appointment and felt fine. \n\nThe nurse in recovery had warned me about my milk coming in, so I was kind of ready for it but it still sucked. I wore sports bras for about a week and kept putting cabbage leaves on my boobs to soothe them (along with ice packs). Mine dried up fairly quickly, within two weeks, but there were a few days where I was really uncomfortable. I had my procedure on a Thursday and I was back to work the following Tuesday, albeit on a pretty flexible schedule, which was good for my mental state. \n\nI\u2019m sorry you\u2019re in this position. I hope that the process is physically a smooth one for you, and that you find a good support system for the days/weeks/months ahead. If you ever need someone to talk to, PM me any time.

Pain was mainly managed by ibuprofen and a heating pad.  I was given medication to contract my uterus which wasnt fun, but I don't know if that was just because my uterus was so big due to triplets.  My throat was also very sore from the breathing tube so maybe have some cough drops or hard candy ready.  You'll want to monitor your bleeding to make sure ot isn't too heavy.  I unfortunately ended up needing a D&amp;C a few days later but this was due to a complication from a triplet pregnancy and not common.
