From what I understand, it doesn't necessarily get better, but it becomes more bearable with time.\n\n1) Suggestions to jump start natural m/c process: I also opted to pass my first pregnancy naturally, but visited a doctor and obtained a couple doses of Cytotec in case I felt I didn't want to wait anymore. I lasted about two weeks after finding out about the m/c before taking the Cytotec, but unfortunately it didn't work. It took another two weeks (four weeks cumulative) for the pregnancy to pass. Cytotec, from what I understand, is the safest and most controllable way to pass a pregnancy non-invasively, but only if it works.\n\n2) My husband and I waited until January of the following year more due to emotional healing rather than wanting to get back on the horse. My doctor (the good one, not the bully) advised waiting two full period cycles in order to give your body time to get back to a business-as-usual routine. \n\n3) How to handle people who take it for granted: even to this day I get all green-eyed monster whenever I see someone triumphantly announce a pregnancy like it was no big deal. I do a lot of hiding posts with the only exception being when it's someone I know who has experienced loss or difficulty in conceiving - then it's a victory because it gives me and everyone else like me hope. I don't know... that's my own thing to continue coming to terms with, I guess.

Then lying there, I finally put together why I am feeling so sad. All the \"should have beens\" just came rushing in. I should not still be at this point.

She deserves so much better.  \n\nAnyway, I started crying and tried to keep it quiet but ended up waking up my husband.

Cannot. Focus. At. Work. Today. Also, there was a cheerio on the floor of the ladies' bathroom. WHO WAS EATING CEREAL ON THE TOILET? This is what's on my mind besides work. \n\nI finally started an address list for baby shower invites last night. It's a huge time crunch because the shower is less than a month away, but after the family drama I got even more ambivalent about it than I had been before. I mean, I know it will probably be fun once I get there, but I'm also stressed out about getting invites out and making sure I included the right people. And having my mom's side of the family pretty much all show their total disinterest in the whole thing makes me feel like people don't want  to come and that I'm putting everyone out. I wish we'd just skipped the shower idea or just let my MIL do one for my husband's family. I hate planning events and attending events where I'm supposed to be the center of attention. I'd so much rather spend all the money to get ready for the baby ourselves. Is that crazy or what?\n\nI guess as I finally start to feel more attached to the pregnancy and baby (and I probably have a long way to go here because bonding feels terrifying. Attachment = more to lose), I also feel like it's more personal. I've shared less about the baby and the pregnancy publicly and I cringe when people ask questions about it because I just don't want to share. Is that awful and selfish? I know this isn't just our daughter. She's a niece, grandchild, cousin and so much more to other people. But I'm just feeling really guarded these days about sharing this experience with anyone other than my husband. I've been tempted to put a \"keep out\" sign on my belly. Lol.
