I can't help but feel our efforts will be for nothing and the FET won't work. I've been experiencing more and more negative feelings. It bothers me because my bf isn't very far along at all and acting like the baby is a guarantee. Talking about when he/she gets here and maternity leave. I don't want anything bad to happen but I hate how people view my experience as something that won't happen to them. Nobody is immune from pregnancy loss. Her carefree attitude rubs me the wrong way. \n\nI'm eating more and drinking more lately. My grief is resurfacing more and it's been almost seven months since our loss. Everyone assumes we're okay and they don't talk about my daughter anymore. My husband is much more quiet and distant. I feel like everything is riding on this FET. I feel so much pressure and hating life right now.
