I think when confronted with another's grief we want to fix it, make it better, make it go away and heal up immediately and then we can stop feeling awkward and useless not knowing what to do. I think it is important to tell/remind people that loss and grief do not work this way. They cannot be fixed, and they do not go away. They become a permanent part of your life, even if they may evolve and change shape over time. Sometimes the very best and most helpful thing you can do is to go ahead and allow yourself to feel a little awkward and just say \"I'm so sorry\" and acknowledge how shitty and unfair it all is, and acknowledge that the grieving person's feelings are valid, are ok, are accepted, no matter what they are.\n\nThis is often still hard for me to do even now that I have experienced a loss myself - the instinct to avoid awkwardness and to try to fix things is strong.

Thank your for sharing. It really hit the nail on the head. \n\nThe last thing any of us wants when going through a loss is sympathy. It reeks of \"oh, sucks to be you\" without that element of \"I know how it feels.\" Sympathy just consists of well-meaning but ultimately meaningless platitudes. \n\nThat's why I only talked about my losses with people who had experienced something similar and why this group had been such a godsend. Hearing other people's experiences helped so so much! It made me feel less alone.\n\nI have said many times, \"I don't want sympathy, I want empathy.\"  If somebody doesn't \"get it\" I honestly don't want to hear what they have to say because (by no fault of their own) they're likely to say the wrong thing. That's why I won't comment on posts about stillbirth, infant loss, or TFMR because all I would have to offer is sympathy which again, is not what that person needs.\n\nIt doesn't matter how pure our intentions are, unless we've had a similar experience, we can never really understand what that person is going through. This really hit home when my sister and I had a heart to heart about my losses and her cancer. As much as we tried to put ourselves in each other's shoes, we realised that neither of us really understood the other person's grief or journey. She has really struggled to find people from whom she can get that truly empathetic response and has instead been flooded by sympathy which just makes her feel worse.\n\nThe \"at least\" observation in the video was spot on. Somebody said to me \"at least you have your son, and maybe that's all you're meant to have\" which, while well intentioned, absolutely destroyed me. Yes, I know how lucky I am to already have a living child but I also have three dead ones who I wish were also alive. \n\nLong story short, if you don't have anything relevant to share, a simple \"I'm so sorry\" is the best response.

My abnormal HSG has caused me to slip into a semi-dark place that I've not been in for several months. My losses were both early, and even though this second one was a rollercoaster, I'm finding most resources targeted at later term miscarriage/baby loss don't resonate with me as much as things related to infertility, I'm discovering. I am having a very hard time accepting all that has happened to me. I want to preface that statement by acknowledging that in the grand scheme, I have had a cake walk compared to most in this sub (I know I don't have to say that, but I do feel that way). Still, my background and history of intense fantasizing and glamorizing the perfect pregnancy, TTC being joyous, and having children before age 30 has fucked me up big time. I've had a relatively stable life and most things I've wanted, I've achieved - a common characteristic among many Type A, perfectionist ladies with a tendency toward control. But I believe my past and my personality are making me take what is happening to me especially hard. I keep looking backwards \"BUT I HAD A PLAN...\" \"But if you only knew how much I WANTED THIS\" \n\nThe gap between my expectations of this process and reality is widening further and further every day, and I'm just...not coping well because of that. This leads to me feeling like I'm having a pity party and being a baby most days. I find messages about how I am NOT a special snowflake who is shielded from pain and bad things happen to people all the time, regardless if they saw it coming or deserved it, oddly comforting - these messages somehow resonate. Do you guys think I am speaking the language of women experiencing infertility vs baby loss? I guess one can experience both and we don't have to have both feel in one camp. I suppose I need to strive for acceptance, but man that feels really, really difficult. Thanks for letting me vent &amp;lt;3 \n\nOn a semi-funny yet NOT funny note, I realized yesterday that for ALL three of my loss-related doc appointments this week, a pregnant nurse checked me in, drew my blood, or took my blood pressure.

When I first joined this sub and was TTC right after my first loss, I spent hours every month on that countdown to pregnancy website seeing when I should receive a BFP if I was pregnant. Others would not test at 9dpo and I would be like \"how can't they not test?!\" How!!! - the willpower!!\" Some people test at 11dpo and others wait until their missed period! The madness! (I thought - and still do). However, I think what I've come to realize is that a distinction in those that test early vs don't might in some cases be HOPE. I've found those who test earlier are usually TTC soon after loss or have been trying for less time. And you have lots of HOPE. You want that BFP as soon as you can know! Nothing is wrong with that and it DOESN'T make you a moron in any sense of the word. Maybe some of it stems from anxiety or control (speaking from experience here, not saying that's you), but I think it's a good sign that you are hopeful. \n\nI never understood how people might wait to test, but now after having a bad experience with my second loss and getting positive tests for 45 days, the magic has worn off for me. I trust no tests. I hate to test. Maybe when I try again I'll be one of those will-powered women who wait? (Gasp!) But if so its because the process is in some way damaged for me. It's hard to say which side of the fence is easier to be on -- early testing and hopeful yet anxious and your day is ruined by a BFN multiple times in a cycle OR hardened and bitter, \"fuck testing I have NO hope anyway.\"  I'm generalizing a bit and rambling here, but I just wanted to say that I hope you don't beat yourself up or judge yourself harshly for testing and not temping and feeling sad. All of that is a normal part of TTC and especially TTCAL. Allow yourself to go through those motions and jump down the rabbit hole of crazy if you are so inclined. We have to move THROUGH the process, not around. You're not insane and you're not a glutton for punishment. You want a baby, and you want it so bad that you'll disrupt your sleep and your life. It's just a symptom of the wanting. Take care of yourself today &amp;amp;lt;3 We are here for you.

For me, it was trying to have children before 35, and doing things like finishing my PhD and all that comes with that. None of that is going to happen, and painful reminders abound. So here's the thing about those kinds of situations, first, it is hard for us type As to accept that we can do everything right, and still not get the outcome we expect. This is particularly true we are accustomed to having things work out and when we do the right things. I expect what you are experiencing is at least similar to cognitive dissonance. It is a real, defined thing that causes psychological pain when we have to hold two (or more) things in our minds (beliefs, understandings) that are not really able to coexist. For me anyways, it has been fighting to hang onto the idea that if I do all the right things, everything will work out. Because it turns out, that is not the case all the time.\n\nSecond, is that you commented on having a hard time accepting things. Keep in mind, you are grieving, and acceptance is the very last stage. And I don't just mean grieving the loss of the pregnancy, you are now encountering new dimensions of grief with regards to the loss of some of these ideas you have held about yourself and how your life and body were. I know this won't alleviate the very real pain you are experiencing right now, but one of the best things you can do is to be gentle and patient with yourself. Have hope that you will get there. It will be a struggle, but you also do not have to do it alone. Keep coming here, reach out to a therapist, allow your husband to be a full partner in this by sharing what you are going through.\n\nSo, we learn that we are not special snowflakes. I think we are something better than that. I don't even know what it is yet, because some days I struggle to find anything that I can appreciate about myself, but I try to go back to the hope that I am just in the process of becoming something better, something stronger. I've shared this before (maybe even with you, if so, sorry for the repetition), but this poem is something I spend time with on my tough days: https://allpoetry.com/poem/8534703-The-Guest-House-by-Mewlana-Jalaluddin-Rumi", "controversiality": 0, "created_utc": 1474120890, "distinguished": null, "gilded": 0, "id": "d7qj11x", "link_id": "t3_5369ex", "nest_level": 2, "parent_id": "t1_d7qgbhc", "reply_delay": 6620, "retrieved_on": 1475767455, "score": 2, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "ttcafterloss", "subreddit_id": "t5_34scd"}, {"author": "FlyingDutchmansWife", "author_created_utc": 1408319117, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_text": null, "author_fullname": "t2_hxbmu", "body": "I've been doing mindful meditation for a few years (check out any of Jon Kabat-Zinn's stuff - that's where I started). One of his chapters is titled, \"You can't stop the waves but you can learn to surf.\" It's in reference to quieting your mind but boy do I apply that to all the shitty things that happen to me. My mantra is \"Keep on surfing.\" \n\nAnother book that really touched my heart is When Breath Becomes Air by Paul Kalanithi. Pick up a box of tissues with this book bc it will make you cry. I finished reading it on a plane and I couldn't help but sob. It's very moving and I think you would identify with it. \n\nAnd the third thing I would recommend is taking time each day to list all the things you're grateful for. I do this in the shower in between thoughts on how to improve code. It keeps me grounded and focused on all the things going right in my life and a reminder of how far I've come. \n\nI've been dealt a pretty shitty hand in this game of life but I would say I'm doing fantastic despite that. I catch myself being jaded by this and I can struggle with empathy at times (it's the whole if I can live through that and be successful so can you). But I've grown and learned everyone is different. And some people are fortunate in life to not have to deal with adversarial situations until they're adults. I guess I got a head start in that arena and learned how to cope at an early age.
