I'm on CD13 and my cycles are usually around 28-30 days.  With a usual 14-day LP, ovulation is pretty much upon us and can happen any day now.

I don't anticipate we'd be in there for much longer than 15 minutes at a time, and from what I remember of my last visit several years ago, it wasn't even really that hot in there.  Hell, I think we've taken showers that are hotter than the sauna.\n\nShould we just postpone the massage visit until a few days after ovulation, or is that also inadvisable in case we we had succeeded in conceiving?
