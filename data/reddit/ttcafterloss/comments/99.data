I've found it okay to put on a fake face around people who don't know, but I told two of my best friends when we started trying because one of them was pregnant and the other had just started trying as well. The one who had just started trying got pregnant right away, and I was so jealous from the beginning. We hadn't even conceived at that point, but I was still jealous, perhaps irrationally so. I did confess that I was thrilled for them, but feeling the pressure now to join the club. She was hurt by that, and didn't understand that since I had only been trying for one cycle at that point, she felt that the only way I could be happy for them was if I conceived first. This was so not the case. I was just fearful of seeing my friends' lives change in wonderful ways and me being left behind. It was a little irrational of me, but it was still what I was feeling. Little did I know, I got a positive test a few days later, but within a week I watched it fade away. I did tell both friends, and they were great about checking in and reaching out. I was devastated, even though the loss was so early, and it made the feeling of not being in the club even more intense. Since then, I've found it so difficult to actively ask questions about their experiences, but recently in the last week, I've just bucked up and done it. It is hard. One of my friends said something that encouraged me to be brave. She said that she was happy to give me space and all the support possible, but this was also an important time in her life and she didn't want me to regret not being a part of it. I know I need to be there for them, just as they need to be there for me. It still hurts though. Every \"how'd your appointment go?\" or \"how is the nursery coming along?\" stings, but I know I won't regret asking. I hope that sort of helps.
