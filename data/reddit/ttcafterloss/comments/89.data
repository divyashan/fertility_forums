I know everyone is different but for us, my age, and desire to conceive again ASAP, I feel the d&amp;c was the right choice for us.  We went in yesterday at 2pm, and I was put under general.

I woke up, but was pretty out of it for the rest of the evening and ended up sleeping from 5-10:45pm and then straight to bed.  Honestly though, I feel so much better today.

My doctor, however, wasn't concerned at all because on Jan 14 (11 days post-Cytotec) my beta hcg was just 79. She actually said that ultrasounds can be unreliable and cause unnecessary panic - which was my case. For the record, my hcg was 30,000 the day I found out I miscarried on 12/23, so quite a drop. \n\nI'm not a doctor, but if I were in your shoes and was tired of riding it out, I would request another blood test to monitor your levels and make sure they are dropping appropriately. It's not invasive like an ultrasound and will still give you results. At the very least, it's clear that your body is doing SOMETHING, which is good!\n\nI'm sorry you're going through this. Just so you know, if you are getting blank pregnancy tests, I would start using OPKs. I started using them and temping just to see when I could expect my period, and two days after my last \"gush\" I ovulated, which I wouldn't have guessed was even possible.
