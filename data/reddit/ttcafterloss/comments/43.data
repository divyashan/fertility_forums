I understand the pain that comes with feeling like your body is failing you. I do want to say though, that I know your doc and many people on this sub have mentioned that it can take a long time (sometimes 6 weeks, sometimes longer) for your body to go back to \"normal\" after loss and especially having a D&amp;C. In fact, after loss, your body may not return to normal for a while. Mine never did. My cycles were completely out of whack and unpredictable after my first loss. I eventually threw the notion out the window that my body was trolling me or being wtf in a given cycle because that WAS the new normal. \n\nWhen I was also in the height of symptom spotting, thinking that every single symptom certainly meant a BFP on my first cycle trying after loss, someone on this sub said to me \"women's bodies can do anything at any time for any reason\". I of course did not want to hear this because I wanted all of my very strange symptoms to mean I was pregnant. I of course wasn't and it was months before I'd become pregnant and I experienced two more losses as a result. So women's bodies can be crazy and loss does that to us. Not just a mental fuck up, but physical too. It sucks. \n\nI know your partner wants you to be pregnant again and you do more than anything. That desire is very common right after loss. But at this time practicing self care and being kind and gentle to your body is the best thing you can do. Going to the doctor for answers is fine, but unfortunately you will likely hear that this is normal, because it is. The question about \"when will I get my period after my D&amp;C?\" is probably the #1 most asked in this sub. It wouldn't be asked if women got their periods \"on time\" afterwards. I realize it's torture but you are being very hard on yourself for something out of your control. Good luck and let us know if you do go to the doc.

The other is a great community hospital, 15 min away, could be attended by my nurse midwife and not Ob/residents only like at the big hospital.

It is very possible, but deeply confusing, to feel happy for someone else as your own grief deepens and intensifies. Feeling \"left behind\" many times over in addition to the grief of loss and/or infertility is really hard. \n\nI'm sorry to hear that you have not found the IF sub welcoming. I started there, came here after a second MMC in May 2016, and now am more over on the IF sub, and I really struggled with the feeling of not belonging anywhere for quite a few months. There are definitely other women there who have experienced multiple losses, but the common thread is the need for increasing medical intervention, which is complicated, (often) painful, and expensive. All of it sucks. For me, it was like a shitty toss up of which hurts most - my history of recurrent losses or my seeming inability to conceive again while most folks I connected with here over a year ago moved on (here again - so very happy for them, deeper depression for me). I've learned to find different kinds of support in these different places. Lately, the despair of not conceiving again and fears relating to beginning IVF have been more potent, but that ebbs and flows around loss anniversaries.\n\nMy impression is that all of this is made all the more isolating by women grieving the loss of motherhood in so many ways getting entrenched in their own islands of grief. It's like some crazy archipelago where we all feel excluded from the mainland, but also from each other. Lately I've been returning support to a good friend, who after one unicorn successful pregnancy is going through her fourth early loss. While I internally struggle with the thoughts of, \"Yea, but at the end of this, you'll still have your son.\" I also can't imagine being forced to be at all these baby-friendly events with other moms doing surprise pregnancy announcements and people brazenly asking about when they will have another.

Prior to the BCP's, I was anywhere from 28 to 36 day cycles with ovulation anywhere from CD14 to CD19. It just takes time.\n\nAlso, please forgive my confusion (I've not been on reddit in a while) - the switching in your post between husband/fianc\u00e9 has left me not understanding your relationship with the father of your lost pregnancy or if you perhaps have two partners. Whatever the case may be, he may need some education about the intricacies of TTC after pregnancy loss as well, to avoid saying things that are unintentionally insensitive to you and cause more pain than hope. My own husband used to say some really painful things due to not understanding the logistics of TTCAL which just rubbed salt in the wounds - a thorough \"realities of reproductive biology\" discussion cleared this up pretty quickly.\n\nEdit: So I was reading the sub, catching up on what's been happening while I've been away. My bullshit radar hasn't dinged like this in months. While pregnancy loss isn't something I'd wish on anyone, I hope a second pregnancy isn't just a scheme to make a married boyfriend leave his wife?

It looks like you do not have a positive test yet. It can be confusing the first couple cycles, because the test line should not really be interpreted until it is darker than the control line. The test line can fluctuate before turning positive, so it does not mean that you've missed it. \n\nFor what it's worth, I had the most stress with my super expensive ClearBlue digital monitor, because it stopped picking up my LH surge altogether and would just say high fertility for like 20 days. When I used both it and the Wondfos, the Wondfos picked up ovulation that was confirmed with bloodwork and ultrasound - alleviating my fears that I wasn't ovulating at all. \n\nJust stick with it, and keep an eye on your CM - it can help signal when ovulation will be coming up. It looks like you are probably closer to an LH surge than not. Thankfully the test strips are cheap, so continuing to test is no big deal. If you never get a positive, it may just mean they are not detecting your surge, or your surge is really short so if you tested in the AM, and it happened around noon, then it may seem like it was missed.

Pregnancy loss is one of those things that only gets harder with experience. I felt very similarly to you leading up to and during my second MMC - even though it took us 13 months to conceive again, I held on to hope that it would be different. When I found out about the first, I was shocked, devastated, but had lingering hope that like for most people, it wouldn't happen to me next time. And then it did. It's been over a year since my most recent loss, and I still don't think I could find adequate words to express how that felt. It's a whole new set of losses, primarily a huge loss of hope for the future, and you need to allow yourself to grieve that, as well. \n\nFor now, give yourself permission to do whatever you need to get through this one day at a time. You don't owe anyone anything. If you are feeling afraid of what family will say, maybe you wait to tell them. A few days or a week won't hurt. This needs to be about what you need. Or, what I did because of feeling not ready to talk, I wrote close friends and family an email and said I wasn't ready to talk yet. Maybe you don't go to the gathering this weekend, if that's what you need, it's okay. Don't get anxious from feeling trapped, decide what is best for *you* and do that unapologetically. \n\nI know you worry that you are running out of strength. Don't be afraid, it will come back, you just need some time. Take all the time you need.
