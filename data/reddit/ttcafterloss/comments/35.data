Like, I would never wish this on anyone, but it is comforting to know that you're not alone in this.\n\nI think with your work, presumably you've had to talk to a supervisor about what's happening so that they can give you the time off that you need. I think I might consider asking them to let any of your colleagues that knew about the pregnancy know that it has unfortunately ended in loss. In a way you're kind of lucky that you have the time off planned already because it means you won't have to be around when people first hear the news -- people's first responses tend not to be very helpful at all. As for your patients, I can appreciate how difficult it will be to talk to them about this. It's hard enough talking to friends about it. I probably would try to avoid any awkward/triggering questions by letting them know what's happened when you see them next. I've found that just saying it in a completely matter-of-fact way is the best way to stave off further discussion. I know that it's not easy to do that. I've had terrible anxiety about just talking to people since my loss because I am so afraid they will bring it up or mention something about pregnancy/babies that will tip me over the edge. If you're not feeling strong enough to mention the miscarriage to your patients when you see them, just don't. If they bring it up, honesty is the best policy. One thing I've found really helpful for coping with the sadness is to just let it in for a couple of seconds, just for as long as you can give it when it comes, and then try to reframe it. I try to focus on how much I love the baby that I lost, because I know that it is that that is making me hurt. So, I close my eyes for a count of five and let myself be sad, then I push the sadness away, tell my baby I love him and miss him, and try to get on with whatever I was doing.\n\nI hope you don't need that second dose, but if you do I hope it works. That being said, I have to say I'm a big fan of the D&amp;C. I know that a lot of people try to avoid them, and I can absolutely understand why, but for me it was like magic. I went in to surgery in a lot of pain and when I woke up it was gone. And psychologically it was good for me to know that it was just over.

I stayed home from work and just posted on here, chatting with you fine folks and my IRL friends and it was a real treat. I was able to vent lots of hateful frustrations and bitch and complain and that was very needed. Two of my friends stopped by to see me and my MIL made me tea and chicken noodle soup and totally doted on me. Has anyone else found it easier to deal with the emotional pain of loss while you were in the midst of the physical pain or procedures? It's like I'm too distracted by the physical act of miscarriage to even think about the emotional stuff. Somehow it's been a reprieve. That being said, I cannot do this again. I cannot experience pain like I did the night before last again and get nothing out of it. Wish I had some type of guarantee that I wouldn't. \n\nOnce I get over the little to do list and milestones I made in my head about all the things related to this pregnancy, I think I'll be okay. I'm accepting that I'm at three, I guess. Of course I'd rather get 75 BFNs than get pregnant and lose it, but I'm telling myself that I'm back to the same place I'd be if we just didn't get pregnant this cycle. It was the last month of the mythical increased fertility from my HSG, so let's hope my body stays semi-fertile. Three pregnancies in a year from a 33 year old isn't too shabby, right? And I suppose another silver lining is that if I didn't get pregnant this cycle and something is wrong, I wouldn't have figured it out yet. This loss propelled me right back to the RE office and into the care of a doc I have faith in that will give it to us straight and not rest until there's a baby in our arms. So yeah. It is what it is. I hope I have something easily tweakable with an easy treatment. I'm going to distract myself with my clean eating program and get right back into working out as soon as I'm able and I hope my next cycle and testing will be here in no time. I still have hope. \n\nThe joy and fullness that I felt in these few weeks I was pregnant was so amazing. I felt so happy, blessed, grateful, and hopeful. It felt right in my heart. Whenever I do get pregnant with my take home rainbow leprechaun baby (it's totally gonna be a leprachan my husband and I both have red hair, lord help him or her), I want to be able to feel those positive feelings again. That baby deserves for me to have hope for him or her. I'm going to try so hard to keep the faith.

I bought my first diva cup when I was just on the cusp of turning 30 and I was very disheartened by their sizing \"if you've had a kid or you're over 30, size 2...if you're under 30 and childless, size 1\". Well wtf was I supposed to do? I have no kids but surely being age 29 I do not have the wide sized 2 vagina of a 30+ year old already?! I think I bought size 1 and it didn't fit lol. Ah the fun ways we deny our age. \n\nNow onto the real issue. The despair you feel is totally normal. I went to the REs office 5 months after my first loss when we had been trying for like 8 months total. Your funk is the result of TTC for a year and not having a baby to show for it. Most of us should have babies by this point and it's quite devastating that we do not. I don't have articles or blogs to share, or books or facts, because frankly statistics mean nothing to me anymore. The fact that most women who have a loss will go on to have a healthy pregnancy next time around may be true, but has not applied to me, now twice. So I'm a bitter hag. But I'm not giving up the hope. And I have no idea where that hope comes from.  Probably from the fact that I do hear so many annoying stories of women who have tried for [insert ungodly number of years here] and have babies. Women who have had 3, 4, 5 losses, but go on to have several children. The odds really are in our favor, but what we can't predict is how long it'll take us to get there, how many losses and procedures/treatments we might have to undergo, and what our emotional state might be along this awful journey. To me that's the scary part. I'm not even close to accepting that I'll never have children on my own. Modern medicine is WAY too advanced to have that worry yet. And I'm 33 with 3 losses under my belt. While that feels really crazy to say out loud, and 31 year old year old pre-loss me would shudder at the horror of the current state of my uterus and empty arms, it's totally not worst case scenario. \n\nI understand how hard it is. How easy it is to get desperate. We have a blank slate, open road in front of us with NO reassurance or guarantee that this will happen for us. So you have to ask yourself, how badly do you want this and how far are you willing to go? Many many women are indifferent about children or want them but aren't going to sell their belongings to pay for IVF and other invasive treatments. Many people would be happy to adopt or be dog parents. If you want to find comfort in being okay without children, that's certainly possible. Many women do it, but it takes some time. It takes recognition and appreciation of the things your life can be filled with without children. I wish I had better advice on that piece of it, and would be able to tell you how you'll be okay if it never happens. But I cannot myself even go there in my mind. I cannot even think of the possibility of not having my own children. To me, it would be the worst thing in the world and I'd need to do some serious, life altering soul searching to be okay. I want it more than anything else in the world and I'll do anything to have kids. I'll have three more miscarriages. I'll do IVF. I'll do whatever I have to. I'll try three more years. None of this is ideal. But I've been in this sub for a long time, and your chances, from a purely statistical (not personal or anecdotal) point of view are totally good. \n\nHave you been to an RE to get stuff checked out? My OPKs said that after 3-4 mo this or using them without getting pregnant, go to the doc. And that's what I did. And we found some stuff that was wrong. And fixed it. But we didn't fix all of it, apparently. Don't wait around and be a passive player in your own fertility. Don't worry if you've had \"only\" one loss or only been trying for so long. This is your life and you have every right to fight for what you want and take advantage of what's available to you to get it. If you want children, don't resign yourself to being okay without them after one year of trying *if you feel strongly* about having them. What I'm trying to say is, don't give up. I've said it on this sub a million times, but when I started TTC and had my first loss, I told my friends and therapist I'd need to be put in a padded room I'd be so utterly inconsolable if I didn't have a baby by one year. Well I've been trying for 16 months and have had three losses and I'm okay. I'm standing. I'm here. I'm not giving up. And for every woman in my situation there are 5 in alumni that have had one loss and went on to have a lovely, healthy pregnancy and baby. It can and does happen. We can't say what will happen to you. I will never say \"It'll happen! Don't worry!!\" To anyone ever. But I will say that whatever does happen, you're much stronger than you think. You'll get out of your funk in your own time - don't force it. Be easy and gentle on yourself and take advantage of the power you do have (such as going to the doc) and you'll feel more in control of your fertility. I've been where you are and it's not fun. I am wishing you luck and hope you're not here for much longer \u2764", "controversiality": 0, "created_utc": 1483103293, "distinguished": null, "edited": 1483111621, "gilded": 0, "id": "dbsknlo", "link_id": "t3_5l1i87", "nest_level": 1, "parent_id": "t3_5l1i87", "reply_delay": 31010, "retrieved_on": 1484149531, "score": 9, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "ttcafterloss", "subreddit_id": "t5_34scd"}, {"author": "bloomng", "author_created_utc": 1478005167, "author_flair_css_class": "", "author_flair_text": "TTC#1, Cycle 5 (cycle 2 post MC)", "author_fullname": "t2_12ipxy", "body": "This is my first cycle post MC.

You'll also be surprised how bitter, angry and resentful you can become as the world goes on around you while yours has stopped. Taking time to alert those in your life to what's going on gives them a chance to stop with you, to say they're sorry, and treat you with a little bit of comfort and grace which you very much need right now. You're human. You've experienced a devastating loss. You cannot are are not expected to pick up the pieces and put on a brave face.

Come here to vent about those. \n\nI had my third loss this week so this ain't my first rodeo. I wanted to make sure everyone that I would tell eventually already knew so I wouldn't have to keep reopening the wound and telling the story.  I texted all of my friends, called my parents, and emailed coworkers that would need to know why I was missing work and why i'd be shutting my door and being anti social when I did return. Getting in front of this is hard, but can be helpful. I am happy to help you craft language and responses. Something that I've done that might apply to your field work and with your patients might be: \n\nYou: Hi how are you?\nPatient: Good you? \nYou: Well to be honest I've been better. I know last month/week/visit I shared with you that I was pregnant. Unfortunately we found out the pregnancy is not viable/is not going to work out. It's been very sad. I hope you'll excuse me if I'm not my usual cheerful self. \n\nAs for others in your life, phone calls, emails, and texts work wonders. Waiting until it comes up in conversation or seeing people in person has put undue anxiety and stress on me. I like to get it out there and then they can deal with it. \n\nIf you've told people, you'll be asked about it. It's good to have a canned response that you can repeat that you feel comfortable with. It's okay if you break down and cry. Don't worry about appearing strong. You are strong and your strength will be evidenced by the next few days, hours, weeks, and months, trust me. We're here for you lady.

I remember when I was still dating my husband, and we went to his younger brothers wedding. Shortly after, his brothers wife announced her pregnancy - I mean she literally got pregnant on their wedding night - and I remember feeling sooooo salty about it, even though my husband and I weren't even married, or even engaged yet (not that you need to be married to have kids - in fact we had our son before we got married - but I'm just using that to make my point about how irrational my thoughts were). I was salty because my husband and I are both the oldest grandchild for both our families, and I had this stupid wish to carry that on by being the one to have the first grandchild on both sides. It obviously didn't work that way, and everything went completely backwards after that (got pregnant by accident, then got married), but I can say in the end, I'm glad it worked the way it did. I didn't know it *then,* but in terms of \"having the first grandchild\" thing, it's overrated. The grandparents and relatives don't treat any of them any differently. The novelty of my niece being the \"first\" wore out as soon as I got pregnant with our son. So don't stress. I get it, though. What makes it hard for me now, bringing back the saltiness again for me, is that we've had two MMCs this year trying for #2, and my SIL (the one who had the first grandchild by getting pregnant on her wedding night) supposedly is wrought with reproductive issues like PCOS, is obese and has diabetes, but got pregnant the nanosecond she wanted to both times with her two kids - and I'm over here having two losses in six months.

Only 5.5 weeks after giving birth - almost 7 weeks sooner than last time (though my period never came, since Peter snuck his little self inside my uterus. \u2764\ufe0f) \n\nI've been doing a lot of what ifs and whys lately. Did I get pregnant too sooner? Was it because I was nursing my toddler during both those pregnancies? What if the MFM had given me Lovenox at 8 weeks like I asked - would I be nearing my third trimester instead of experiencing CD2? \n\nI can't wait to start therapy next month. I also have an appointment with Crappy MFM in January. Then an appointment with Yale MFM at the end of March. (FOREVER away, but the leading researcher on placentas and blood disorders is out of the office till then. No rush for me TTC, so I'm okay with waiting.)", "controversiality": 0, "created_utc": 1483109672, "distinguished": null, "gilded": 0, "id": "dbsnvwb", "link_id": "t3_5l25dl", "nest_level": 1, "parent_id": "t3_5l25dl", "reply_delay": 28207, "retrieved_on": 1484151107, "score": 3, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "ttcafterloss", "subreddit_id": "t5_34scd"}, {"author": "Amc1984", "author_created_utc": 1470315914, "author_flair_css_class": "", "author_flair_text": "4 losses, 2LC: BO 4/13, MC 7/13, Clare 21w 4/16, Peter 20w 11/16", "author_fullname": "t2_104bb2", "body": "You are so strong.

(I had explicitly asked not to be told and I regret that. I thought I was protecting myself, but I feel like knowing that day is important just to be able to honor my missing baby. Not knowing just makes me feel lost).\n\n2) I was told to consider it a good thing that my 100 mg first round of Clomid yielded 7 follicles (an over response). Can you tell me more about the specifics of why it's a good thing?\n\n3) I have had 8 days of mid-cycle bleeding while I'm on BC. When should it stop? If it doesn't, how will I know when CD1 is? I am not having especially heavy flow, which makes sense, but why is the cramping so much more severe?\n\n4) I'm still having pain that feels like it could be ovarian torsion from the cysts, but I'm not sure. What happens if the cysts don't go away? How does it feel when they do go away? What happens? Do they burst or shrink?\n\nUPDATE: I did call, but procrastinated/felt like waiting until I could talk without crying and it turns out their office is closing early today.

Ask for recommendations from friends and family, and you can also go to an appointment and ask questions about their approach as well.

In my experience the emotional fallout in the weeks and months following my losses is much worse. I'm in the midst of dealing with that right now, because I feel like I am nearing a similar low-point as I hit this time last year because of having so much trouble conceiving again.

It sucks. I also happen to have a size two diva cup, and no stroller, but a stack of pregnancy books that I have \"hidden\" from myself (as though I don't know exactly where they are). \n\nI can't say that I have found much about the issue of long-term TTC, but I am certainly creeping into that territory. We delayed TTC a bit because of me pursuing a PhD and then getting some scary thyroid biopsy results that pushed it back another 6 months until we were confident it was not cancerous. So we started TTC in July of 2014, and it took 8 months to get a BFP. I was so relieved that we conceived because I had been starting to worry. Things went fine until our 10w ultrasound when there was no heartbeat and growth had stopped a little less than two weeks before. I had a D&amp;C, it didn't work, and I had 3 months incredibly painful cramping and heavy bleeding. I probably should have had a second D&amp;C, but that shit was expensive, and after how it went the first time, I was like fuck no. Then we started trying again. And it took even longer to conceive. I had a very early CP in February of 2016, which didn't formally count since I never went for blood work, just had the faint BFP at home that went away almost immediately. I went to see an RE, and got pregnant the next month. Early HCG results indicated I would lose it, but I still saw cardiac activity/heartbeat during weeks 6 and 7, then it was gone at 8. Had a recurrent loss panel, found nothing. Back to TTC again.\n\nPresent day, I have since turned 35 (not really the end of the world, but feels like it sometimes) and have been TTC for 2.5 years. Some days I really struggle, too. Especially this phase where it is getting to be quite a ways out from my last loss. I am still hopeful, and I know that the odds are still good, but I know that some days that cannot diminish the hurt and fear. I miss feeling like me during those days - the person who was motivated and confident, and instead there's this person who cannot name a thing she wants aside from having a baby. I fixate on it when I am feeling especially fearful that I traded away my chance to have a child for a career I can hardly muster the energy to care about anymore (thus my ABD status when I \"should have\" graduated last May, ironically the day of graduation is when my MC started). \n\nI wish I had more to say that would provide comfort or hope. I think what I most want to communicate through all of this is that you are not alone. When you said, \"I just need something to help me feel like I won't be a waste of I never get pregnant again.\" I know that feeling and thought - I deal with it daily. I can't say I am doing particularly well with it right now, but I'm in it with you. I will say, my willingness to do anything to continue to try signals a couple things to me, and maybe it applies to you, too - I'm still hopeful and I have the courage to continue despite all the hurt. Those things count for something. I do also recognize that I have had to struggle more and dig deeper into my personal resources than I expected, and I know there is a bottom line somewhere, where I might have to let go, but I don't know where that is yet.

Just so many feelings, and I don't know what to do with any of them. \n\nSchool is over. I found a job. I have been so, so profoundly anxious about both of these things. The job is a big step out of my comfort zone. I have to go away for training for 5 days and I'm so apprehensive about it. I get weird when I'm by myself. \n\nMaybe now that I don't have the constant emotional turmoil of TTC, my brain has decided that it needs something else to keep itself busy. I'm about halfway through my last pack of birth control. Been taking the super mega folic acid. Trying not to smoke. It's hard. \n\nSomething I've been struggling with lately is dreaming. I have vivid, intense dreams every night. This has been going on for at least a month. It's exhausting. It doesn't seem to matter what combination of sleep-aids I do/don't take. I don't mean to sound like an angsty 15 year-old and say something like \"(\u00af`\u00b7._.\u00b7[I wish that I could just stop dreaming \ud83d\udc94\ud83d\udc94\ud83d\udc94]\u00b7._.\u00b7\u00b4\u00af)\" But really... that would be super nice. Even just for a few nights. \n\nAnyway, I guess I just haven't had much to say.
