I don't know anyone who felt the way I did. I don't know anyone at all, personally, who had an ectopic. It felt very isolating, so I'm glad the internet exists.\n\nI originally reported to Urgent Care at nearly seven weeks pregnant because I had side pain. It was right about where the gallbladder is. I get the same side pain every single month when I ovulate (in addition to the lower side ovulation pain.) They did an ultrasound and discovered small polyps in my gallbladder, a slightly enlarged liver, and nothing in my uterus. I only had the mildest twinge feeling in the lower right abdominal area, which is where the ectopic actually was.\n\nI tell you all this because the methotrexate shot made my side/ stomach pain nearly unbearable. I think it was more to do with stomach acid or gas than gallbladder issues. Later tests showed I have no gallbladder or liver issues so my pain must be cause by something else. I think the methotrexate shot aggravated my stomach lining (because it attacks rapidly multiplying cells). And my stomach is probably one of the most sensitive areas in my body.\n\nEating regular, small, bland meals and using a heating pad was very helpful. The pain only lasted a couple of days and reduced as the drug left my body and the pregnancy was resolved. I ate the ectopic/ methotrexate diet: almost no folic acid with tons of potatoes, chicken, pears, etc. That was the hardest part, because I usually eat a lot of vegetables and can't eat dairy/ grains, etc.\n\nI had a tiny bit of the achey bones in my hips they mention as a side effect but it didn't really bother me and didn't last very long.\n\nI was fortunate to only need the one dose and my HCG was back to &lt;1 eight and a half weeks after the shot. I started at around 1500. I started taking prenatals again when it was &lt;5.\n\nI remember being so afraid of the shot and calling it \"the scary cancer drug\" but in hindsight, it wasn't really so bad. Time has helped so much with how I feel about everything. I spent the time I needed to mourn and recover.

So I'm going to visit him for the first time. The hospital took care of all of it, so I've never had to really think about it until they sent me a letter saying it was done last month. I also have a legit phobia of graveyards and zombies (to the point where I can't stand the idea of coming back as a zombie, so my will demands cremation and unfortunately, no organ donation, and yes, I know the whole thing is absolutely ridiculous, but that's childhood trauma for you), so this is extra horrific for me. I'm hoping I can at least make it to the grave to lay down my flowers.\n\n* And I am also off to try to find a nursing chair today.
