It was inconsistent - big frequent gushes of very fresh, \u201cbloody\u201d-smelling blood, not much clotting, and not constant bleeding. \n\nThe pain on the day was just cramps. In the week after the pain got a bit worse but was more of an ache than cramps and never worse than my periods. It has been definitely present in the second week but is almost gone 13 days later. \n\nEmotionally I felt incredibly relieved to know it was all done with when I left the hospital. \n\nI had a lot of added anxiety due to it being molar and it felt good to know that they\u2019d taken action fast and decisively. \nI couldn\u2019t have dealt with doing it at home on top of the anxiety.
