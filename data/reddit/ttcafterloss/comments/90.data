I lost my first pregnancy too and it was one of the hardest things me and my fiance have ever gone through. Topping it off with the loss of your dog... I am so sorry you went through this. \n\nNow, regarding your questions. Short answer is you never stop obsessing. Especially after a miscarriage. As cruel as it is with the miscarriege we get robbed from part of the joy a successful first pregnancy brings. The worry doesn't stop. In fact it becomes worse. What does change is how you deal with it. For you it's still too fresh. He'll it's too fresh for me and it's been two months since mine and one cycle of post MC trying... With time you'll manage to handle your anxiety and worries. Same goes for your grief. There will be easy days and hard days, it's not w straight line process. But all in all you'll gradually manage to deal. What has helped me is spending as much time as i can to my favorite hobbies (photography and writing). I try to keep myself busy during the waiting between cycles, and when a million stressful thought's invade my mind I remind myself there's little I can control and just plainly struggle to be positive. \n\nRegarding friends' pregnancies... That's a tough one. Personally I'm stuck in that space between being happy for them but also not wanting to see them till I'm pregnant again and well into my second trimester. Of course that ain't possible, so I'm just being honest about being happy for them but also struggling with my loss and feelings. True friends will understand. Just be open with communication. Also venting here every now and that helps loads. \n\nSo all in all hang in there and give yourself time. Not everything will sort out immediately. Be kind to yourself, process your loss and aknowledge your feelings. If toy struggle a lot with anxiety and grief maybe see a counselor/therapist for a couple of times, see if that will help. \n\nI wish you all the best", "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "created_utc": 1582138928, "gildings": {}, "id": "fi4denl", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_f604ko", "locked": false, "no_follow": true, "parent_id": "t3_f604ko", "permalink": "/r/ttcafterloss/comments/f604ko/new_member_introduction_33f_ftm_miscarriage/fi4denl/", "retrieved_on": 1582139033, "score": 1, "send_replies": true, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "ttcafterloss", "subreddit_id": "t5_34scd", "total_awards_received": 0}, {"all_awardings": [], "associated_award": null, "author": "sabulka235", "author_flair_background_color": null, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_template_id": null, "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_14j0rn", "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_premium": false, "awarders": [], "body": "Oh wow!

They called ( this stupid f\\*ing early pregnancy clinic at the hospital) the following tuesday and said that they collected zero tissue.  I had no idea what that meant but the nurse said I must have passed it before the procedure.  This made no sense to me and after my D&amp;C I started to bleed daily I decided to follow up with my GP since this clinic seemed inept .  I had 4 private ultrasounds one every week of august and all of them showed fluid in the uterus that we kept waiting to pass. \n\nFinally I decided enough is enough. I went around the clinic and found out my surgeons name ( who is now my lovley OB) and made an appointment directly with her office.  She Explained that The D&amp;C is a blind procedure that is based on certain grids and they often miss tissue ( I DO NOT UNDERSTAND why they do not ultrasound during every D&amp;C?! like WTF not apparently only on your 3rd do they ultrasound, ridiculous). She said look there is something holding in all that fluid either a blood clot or retained tissue, she sent me for a beta and when it showed a beta of around 30 she said yup its tissue.  She said do you have a high pain tolerance bc I can try to pull out the tissue in my office today but we do not have time for pain management.  I decided to do it al let me tell you it was the worst pain of my life a 10/10.   She pulled some tissue and all the sudden the clearish bloody fluid came out like my water breaking and I thought all is good. She said look I think what we did may mean we've avoided the ER again but lets check this time with a hospital ultrasound.\n\nI went in the next week and they saw everything. Most of the fetal tissue was still present and they could not believe that it was not seen on previous ultrasounds even with the fluid.   It was now the start of sept and it was clear I needed another D&amp;C but this time there was a wait to get it with the camera . by the middle of sept  I was bleeding so heavily that I was soaking my pants and was feeling unwell 24/7 Over the next 5 days I was back and forth in ER and finally after a 24 hour wait they booked me in for an emergency D&amp;C at 10pm on Friday Sept 20th. My fiance and dad were furious that they weren't using the camera but the doctor was confident that it was not worth the risk. This time the doctor was confident he got it all and said that I had a slight tilt to the uterus that was probably why it was missed the first time. This time they also gave me Miso rectally after completion of the surgery and I WAS IN AGONY. Between that and the D&amp;C I went into full on labour contractions but passed nothing additional. \n\n2 weeks later I went septic.  I caught it very very early and was whisked into the ER instantly and put on a drip.  I was cleared a few days later with a healthy empty uterus in early OCT.  My cycle returned on the 20th,  I saw my OB on halloween. She said lets do fertility testing next month but hey it's the 11th day of your cycle why don't you ditch the trick or treaters and try tonight.  We did and now i'm 18 weeks ! \n\nIt was a horrible experience so traumatic and unfair not only do you feel like everyone has these normal pregnancies and don't miscarry but even fellow misscarrying ladies seem to have these \"natural\" MCs.  I even started to loose it mentally thinking that they made a mistake about the baby dying and thats why my MC was so long and hard.  I honestly didn't have all my marbles during this time.  As far as medically.......... The ONLY reason I chose a 2nd D&amp;C is because they did not dialate me or do intense scrapping the first time, it was almost like they did nothing so the risks were more in line with doing one D&amp;C.  It's a controversial opinion but I think if I had to go back and do it again I may have waited to see what my body did naturally a little longer I knew instantly when I had an infection and I was so scared of scarring from surgery", "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "created_utc": 1582153323, "gildings": {}, "id": "fi528cg", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_f6cngu", "locked": false, "no_follow": true, "parent_id": "t3_f6cngu", "permalink": "/r/ttcafterloss/comments/f6cngu/so_frustrated_a_month_out_from_my_first_dc_and/fi528cg/", "retrieved_on": 1582153704, "score": 1, "send_replies": true, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "ttcafterloss", "subreddit_id": "t5_34scd", "total_awards_received": 0}, {"all_awardings": [], "associated_award": null, "author": "DeathOfA-Strawberry", "author_flair_background_color": null, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_template_id": null, "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_4pz979a0", "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_premium": false, "awarders": [], "body": "Thank you..

I have had 3 losses in total. 2 of them were second trimester losses. After my second loss I begged for blood work and I got a recurrent pregnancy loss panel done. I got tested for some clotting factors among other things. I was told everything came back normal. But when I went to a support group they insisted I go back to OBGYN and ruquest copies of blood work and I found I have MTHFR. Well MTHFR is not recognized by the medical field as a cause to losses but others who have what I have were successful with just low dose aspirin and others needed lovenox. Well here came my third pregnancy I asked to be put on lovenox and aspirin and OBGYN said to use only aspirin since I do not have clotting factors and at 18 weeks and 6 days I found out my baby had passed away when I couldn't find a heart beat at my at home doppler. I was devastated. I was determined and obsessed to find someone who would prescribe me lovenox and I knew it would be hard to convince any doctor as I didnt have lab work that proved I needed it. I cried after each specialist that said no to me. 5 specialist later I was approved lovenox because I  have had 2 second trimester losses and he would treat me as an APS (antiphospholipid syndrome) patient, therefore he prescribed lovenox. I was ridiculed by other doctors when they would ask why my doctor prescribed me lovenox and comment \"he is throwing the kitchen sink\". I had doubts if I was doing the right thing. But guess what?! I am now holding my 8 week old son, he is really here! I am sorry for so much information, but it is to highlight that we need to advocate. I joined several groups ex. Ttc mthfr, ttc lovenox ect. It was through those groups that I was informed to ask for lovenox, otherwise, I would've never known. Aside from lovenox on my 4th pregnancy I took low dose aspirin and even asked for progesterone and of course prenatals. Oh and to add my first loss I was 25. second loss at 26, third loss at 33 and at 34 I had my rainbow baby. I was/still am healthy, exercised 5-6 days a week, and ate/eat pretty clean.
