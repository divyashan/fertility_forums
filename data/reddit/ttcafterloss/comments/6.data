You will likely have anger and sadness mood swings and could very well develop depression.  Make sure that you have someone you can openly talk to. Many of us find ourselves keeping everything inside because we feel we sound like a broken record to our friends and loved ones.  There are some who are ashamed by a miscarriage, making you feel even more isolated and alone. \n\nTherapy can be helpful to many people.  With a therapist, you don't have to feel guilty for dwelling on the same thing appointment after appointment.  You are paying that person to listen to you and help you process these feelings. There are websites where you can search therapists interests(such as infertility, miscarriage, child loss, etc) to try and find a good match.  You could also ask your Ob-Gyn/RE if they have a recommendation for a therapist. There is no shame in asking for help, especially if you find yourself having scary thoughts.\n\n**Normal Thoughts and Feelings After a Loss**\n\nGuilt is a normal feeling after a MC, especially for the women who were carrying the embryo/fetus/child.  So often women wonder if they did something to cause a MC. In most cases, that is not the case, but it is hard to \"turn off\" that guilt.  Lots of women also feel silly, like they have imagined a pregnancy or were just dreaming it.  They felt like it almost never happened.  These feelings may be intensified if you didn't have much pain or had a D&amp;C.  If you told family and friends of your pregnancy early, there can be feelings of shame. You may feel \"dumb\" for getting excited for something that didn't last(remember: this is not your fault and any normal person would be excited for a pregnancy).
