Thanks to everyone who commented yesterday with support and concern after my appointment. I'm going to either call the nurses next week and ask if the heart murmur can be tested and explain my family history, or mention it when I'm there on Thursday for a BP check. I'm nervous about them thinking I'm overreacting but I know i have to do what makes me feel better in the end.\n\nI took one pill of my BP medicine and spent the whole night nervously analysing myself, watching for signs of side effects. I know it's better for me to take the medicine than not, but I'm having a hard time quelling my anxiety about it.\n\nThere was one wonderful moment yesterday :) Baby did her biggest kick yet and DH felt it. Surprised us both. He was more excited this time than the first time. He said the first one just felt like a muscle twitch, but this one really felt like a little foot pushing from inside me. Chugging water got her moving so he had me chug two more times and waited, but no dice.

Could i have low progesterone if my MC was missed? I know progesterone is important for keeping a pregnancy, and when mine was tested during it was 11ish, which my dr called \"adequate\". However, my body went on thinking it was pregnant for 5 weeks at least with no baby, and who knows how much longer that would have lasted. 11 seems low from what I've read so I wonder if in general it is low and when we can start trying again I should be on something to prevent another MC, but then I think if it really is low why didn't I miscarry naturally? Any insight or is this one of those things I'll never know without testing for it? \n\nThanks for putting up with my random 6am questions.

Husband is not giving in to my pee stick demands until tomorrow.   I even offered back scratches and seduction and he didn't give in.  Good for him.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nMy thought/rambling for the day and I know it's a common complaint around here, so sorry for the repetitiveness.  My MIL is very sweet, I honestly love her to pieces.  A card arrived in the mail yesterday from her and it was a very sweet \"just thinking of you card\".  But in the card she wrote something about how I just need to be patient and how God's timing is perfect and He has a plan for me, etc.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nSigh.  It's very nice and I know she means well and she is pretty religious.  I am also religious, though the husband and I have kind of fallen out of going to church.  Mostly because my work schedule and the fact that we can't find one close to us that we both like enough.  Anyway, it just kinda bothered me and it makes me feel ... Looked down upon?  First of all, I don't believe that God \"plans\" for me to have a miscarriage.  And if He does, well that's not the kind of God I want to be involved with anyway.  If anything, me getting pregnant had re-energized my husband and I's search for a new church.  The miscarriage stopped that search in its tracks.  So, not really a smart plan on God's part if that's the case.   I only believe that God can make good out of bad, not that he makes bad happen so people can learn lessons or whatever.  I say horseshit.  \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nAnd ugh just the telling me to be patient.  Unless she found my Reddit account, she should have no idea how patient I am or not.  And I don't want to be patient.  I'm tired of being patient.  I've wanted a baby for years and it took me a long time to get my husband on board.   Then I finally get pregnant and the baby dies when I'm almost 11 weeks?  Screw being patient.  I have no choice in the matter.  Whether it happens has nothing to do with me being patient.  \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nSorry for this long rant.  Maybe it's my progesterone talking.  Maybe it's because my job I was going to turn down came back with more money and less hours so now I have the stress of maybe changing jobs coming soon.     And I could really use some wine but have to wait until AF shows.   That's all.  Thanks for those who actually somehow made it through all this haha.

Best present ever :) Went on this crazy 1800 ft elevation hike up a mountain. 4 miles up, 4 miles down.  Not a newbie hiker, but not used to steep elevation hiking either. Almost gave up so many times. Made me think of our group here and the struggles we have all experienced.  Uphill battles, sometimes a bit of a respite when things feel \"flat\" then more uphill.  Beautiful view at the top made me cry.  On the way back down, I decided to open my heart and mind up in a way that I haven't for awhile.  I think I've been pushing things down lately. I'm carrying so much anger and guilt lately, and rather than actively grieving Scarlet, I've been mad at circumstances, which has me feeling off kilter.  I listened to my playlist I had for her while pregnant.  The ones that really got me crying were *You'll be in my heart* by Phil Collins, *Lullabye*by Billy Joel, *Lullabye* by Dixie Chicks, *That's How Strong my Love Is* by Otis Redding, *Little Wonders* by Rob Thomas, and then a new addition for me in my grief playlist is *Fix You* by Cold Play.  No joke, the floodgates opened and I cried for almost the entire 2 hour hike back down the mountain. Lots of snot rockets and stopping to clear my eyes.  Felt very therapeutic though. Got home and realized I was ovulating, BD woohooo and then DH took me for a nice dinner in a small town about half hour a way and then drove to a beautiful scenic place with waterfalls to stargaze a bit.  We toasted at dinner to it hopefully being one of the last boozy dinners we have out together for a while.  Fingers crossed for a birthday miracle. I'm just happy I know that I have definitely ovulated in the almost six months since delivery.  Hope everyone is doing well this weekend.

I think my husband is too. So far this is the longest cycle I've had on record, but I know that's \"normal\" because of the mc and still well within a normal amount of days. I guess what frustrates me is I've been feeling so sickly this time around compared to the first period. Yesterday it was intense swings between anger and crying. Today I'm not feeling as emotionally keyed up, but I woke up with an intensely bad headache and just feeling like I had a hangover even though I'm not drinking or anything. Somehow in a decent mood despite of the feeling. I've been thinking about something I watched yesterday.\n\n\n[TW: a very sad metaphor about miscarriage from The Little Prince]\n\nI watched _The Little Prince_ yesterday. I had liked that book when I was little but hadn't memorized every moment or anything. Somehow I forgot about the part when the prince is explaining to the pilot why he has to leave the world, but without his body:\n\n\"And he took me by the hand. But he was still worrying.\n\n\"It was wrong of you to come. You will suffer. I shall look as if I were dead; and that will not be true . . .\"\n\nI said nothing.\n\n\"You understand . . . it is too far. I cannot carry this body with me. It is too heavy.\"\n\nI said nothing.\n\n\"But it will be like an old abandoned shell. There is nothing sad about old shells . . .\"\n\nI said nothing.\"\n\nIt really hit me when the movie recreated this moment, almost word for word. I thought about my baby and how a gestational sac is like a shell. And for the first time, I _really really_ focused on the love and hope my husband and I generated and how _that_ hasn't died and that's why we've both been wandering around with so much grief and hope stirred up in us. The prince tells the pilot to look at the stars and think of him and somehow that brought me a lot of comfort yesterday. That I could fix my vision on something and allow myself to think about the love and memory and not just focus on the anger and loss and impatience to feel full with pregnancy again. \n\nHang in there everyone! &lt;3", "controversiality": 0, "created_utc": 1470506625, "distinguished": null, "gilded": 0, "id": "d66vvh5", "link_id": "t3_4wev1a", "nest_level": 1, "parent_id": "t3_4wev1a", "reply_delay": 39576, "retrieved_on": 1473256965, "score": 1, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "ttcafterloss", "subreddit_id": "t5_34scd"}, {"author": "spiced", "author_created_utc": 1305365132, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_text": null, "author_fullname": "t2_58gog", "body": "Eeeee!!!

I was soooo sick the past two weeks with this awful cold/flu/cough/plague thing which left me a snotty, coughing, exhausted mess. As of yesterday I finally feel like a human being again. A few weeks ago I was feeling full and super-pregnant but this weekend felt like midway through the second trimester. I had lots of energy, felt light on my feet, and there were moments I forgot I was pregnant. My back didn't even bother me. The fatigue is bound to creep back again anytime soon and my back will undoubtedly play up again so I'll enjoy this feeling while it lasts.\n\nThis weekend we came up with a plan for how to fit the new baby in the house. It will require moving a few things around, getting rid of other things, putting some things into storage, and building a shelf. Things will be tight but we'll manage.\n\nMy sister law offered us her Ergo 360 carrier which will be really handy. We live near the city so we walk nearly everywhere. If we walk more than about a kilometre we have to put my son in the pram. I'm not keen on buying a double pram so until my son can walk longer distances we'll wear the baby. The baby Bjorn is great for newborns (so we'll use that at first) but after 2-3 months it hurt my back. I've heard the Ergo works for older kids. Our neighbours also have a Manduca (?) their youngest daughter has nearly grown out of and they have offered it to us, so we are spoiled for choice with carriers.\n\n(TW: mention of living child) My son is so excited about his baby sister! Yesterday he said he wanted her to come out now. We keep telling him she needs to grow some more before she's ready to come out. The Ovia app has a little handprint with a smaller handprint inside which shows how big the baby's hand is compared to how big it will be when she is born. It's a \"handy\" visual aide for my son. So now he knows when the little handprint is the same as the big handprint then his sister will be ready to come out.\n\nAlso, I've mentioned before how much I love my neighbourhood and today reinforced that yet again. Our neighbours from around the corner dropped by unannounced with their 3.5 and 1 year old girls, and a few minutes later the 3.5 year old girl and 8 year old boy from down the street came over while their mum went grocery shopping. So we had 5 kids in our tiny little house running up and down the stairs, climbing in and out of our son's bed, pulling all his toys out, and generally causing havoc. It was delightful to have a chaotic, impromptu play date. This doesn't happen as often during winter, but during summer our kids just wander into each other's houses and then we send them home when they're done playing. Half the toys at our place belong to the neighbour kids and many of our toys are out on loan. We live in a city of millions of people, but our neighbourhood is a close-knit little village. We will outgrow our house soon, but we want to stay here as long as possible.\n\nBack to work tomorrow.

I love Ikea. We found a lot of things to get for baby and other parts of our house, but didn't buy anything yet. Craziest coincidence happened, we bumped into my friend who had a surprise baby after finding out she was pregnant at like 32+ weeks!! She was out with her tiny little one week old who was born at 35 weeks. Wouldnt have been my choice of a \"I just need to get out\" outing... But it was nice to see the baby. He was soooo small. I was too scared to hold him as we were standing and the floor was concrete and he's so small and... Nope. Would have loved to if it had been at her house!\n\nLater in the evening I settled down on the couch to try and feel baby who hadn't moved all day, which is becoming normal. 8:00 turned to 9 turned to 10 and I started getting nervous. Finally felt her around 10, the little troll.\n\nI felt my heart was pounding and just a little fast and I assumed it was anxiety about not feeling her yet. But it didn't go away even when i did, and I was relaxed. It didn't go away when I went to bed. It just didn't go away, which then did give me anxiety again yes. I don't know if this is a reaction to my BP meds, although I didn't find it mentioned online. Or is this just being pregnant?! Or is my anxiety more out of control than I thought? I tried all I could to feel calm and couldn't fix it. Maybe it'd slow a bit, but the slightest movement would increase it again.\n\nIt's felt the same since I woke up. The only line open at my OB is the emergency line. I don't think it's an emergency although I feel uncomfortable with this. Unless I develop pains or something worse, I guess I'll keep taking it today and hope it gets better or I can call tomorrow... He said don't stop until I consult with him.

I went upstairs to pee because my husband was using the downstairs bathroom, and I decided to swab for discharge with a Q-tip since I've been dealing with BV and yeast infections, just to see what was going on. I got over the toilet, put the Q-tip where I normally do (like the entrance of the vag) and suddenly felt a small gush of liquid. Immediately was reminded of my water breaking in my first pregnancy.. however it was only a small amount of liquid. I freaked out immediately.\n\nI had to pee really bad when I was doing this so I wonder if I just peed and didn't realize it? I didn't think so, from what I could tell there was no smell but at that point I'd had so much water my urine was diluted anyway. There was no more liquid after that. I cried on the couch thinking this was the end of my pregnancy. Called the hospital where I talked to unhelpful nurse robot who asked me many horrible questions that proved she wasn't really supposed to care about my issue, but moreso stick to the script of the list of questions. Then had the nerve to tell me based on answering no to all her questions that I should come to the ER. There was no cramping, bleeding, leaking or anything.. so maybe I did just pee by accident. I'm going to go with that now for my sanity. Naturally my doctor is on vacation this week so if I call my doctor's office I'd be dealing with someone else.. and my next appointment isn't until the end of the month. Fuck.\n\nMy stomach was upset yesterday so I woke up after a few hours of sleep and my stomach was hurting so immediately assumed the worst.

It went away after lying down but every time I got up to pee my stomach would start again. It's not painful but probably just built up gas in there. I hope my baby is okay.. I can't lose this one because there is no trying again. I just can't mentally and emotionally deal with that. Swear to god, I start to feel comfortable being pregnant again and the rug gets pulled out from under me. :(\n\nEdit: Called a birth center at a different hospital where they actually allow you to reach individual sections of the hospital! Got to speak to a nurse who said she'd never heard of an amniotic leak that early and if it was going to be a miscarriage then I'd probably be bleeding. Said the ER couldn't do shit (thought so) and the only way to tell if stuff is okay is to have an ultrasound. So I don't know if I'll end up doing that or not. Either way I feel a little better now I guess.

I'm headed over there today (it's about an hour away) to hang out and pick him up. I'm so excited even though he's only been gone three days.
