We know they can get together and fertilize.  We know they can make a genetically normal baby.  And they have already done all those things *four times*...just not in the right place, and not for long enough.  But both those issues are fixable.  A cerclage surgery and P17 shots during pregnancy have an over 90% combined success rate for preventing early labor, and my nurses are giving me a ballpark of 60% chances of success for IVF with each embryo we transfer...but of course, we've gotta make the embryos first.  We've been through so much already that we decided to out-of-pocket pay for PGS testing as well, because that's one dirty trick I just feel my body would want to play on me during a subsequent pregnancy and I can't handle that kind of loss.  \n\nHere's hopin' for you, as well.  It's nice to still have some familiar faces on this stage of the journey, but on the other hand, when I see someone who's been around the block as many times as I have...I also get so angry and sad for them, too.

I've been there.  There aren't words for how this feels, but you're in good company here, and you don't need to try to articulate them.  \n\nTo answer your questions, gave you reached out to your doctors and asked for resources?  I live near Philadelphia and there is a local organization here that organizes in-person support groups.  My counselor also facilitates groups through this local organization, and she privately counsels through a wonderful group that focuses on infertility, miscarriage, stillbirth, and infant death.  I wouldn't have known about these had I not gotten recommendations from my own team of doctors.  My counselor is an amazing woman (who herself went through a full-term stillbirth 40-ish years ago), and I am so lucky to have her in my life.  \n\nI wish I were just a little closer - I'd be on my way right now to see you and give you a hug if I could.  In October of 2014 my son Ethan was born and died at 22 weeks due to cervical insufficiency, which sounds possibly similar to what you went through.  My body simply couldn't hold him in on my own and I wound up at the hospital in very, very early labor.  A number of us here have gone through similar experiences, as well, and though we're not local I know that it's helped me so, so much to feel that I'm not alone in this kind of loss, which is fundamentally different than what most people would term a miscarriage.  (I learned quickly that even saying \"we lost the baby\" wasn't enough for most people to gain an understanding of what happened to us.)  So please - if your wife is comfortable, we're also all here as a resource.  If connecting over reddit feels too impersonal, I'm here for you in whatever way you need. \n\nI wish I had actual studies bookmarked here on my computer, but while I'm not yet pregnant again (I somewhat inexplicably went through three ectopic pregnancies in the year since Ethan's death, and now we're onto IVF to try to conceive..but we're special snowflakes) the rate of success with a cerclage during the first trimester is very, very high.  About a month and a half after Ethan's death, we made a consult appointment with the MFM team at the hospital where I delivered and they were able to cite studies and explain to me the plan for a subsequent pregnancy, which helped me feel confident about trying again and preventing another loss.  \n\nMy understanding is that the plan for treatment is generally two-pronged and will be paired with bi-weekly ultrasounds to check the development of a baby and your cervical length.  I will also add in a statistic the MFM team gave me that about 25% of the time, cervical insufficiency is an issue that does not recur - in fact, in a bit of morbid humor, there was a European study done that said a woman should not be considered for cerclage until *3* second trimester losses because so often things turn out just fine after only one loss.  (Um...how about we just treat anyway and not bother to find out if I would have been OK on my own..?!) \n\nAnyway, for the first prong: after your first trimester is done, injections of P17 - a synthetic form of progesterone - will be given.  These alone have been shown to reduce the chance of another loss by about 45% (and I like to round that up and say half).  These will of course start after the cerclage surgery, which is done at 12-14 weeks of pregnancy and has about an 80-95% success rate, depending on what study you read (and I'm sorry - I wish I had sources ready to cite for you, but I don't).  Put the two together...and while nothing is ever a guarantee, you realize that while this kind of loss is tragic and awful  and something you never fully recover from, it's a problem that is very, very fixable.  \n\nPlease feel free to reach out anytime - to share your baby's story, to ask for some virtual comfort and sympathy, to feel reassured that you *can* get through this.  Sending you lots of love.
