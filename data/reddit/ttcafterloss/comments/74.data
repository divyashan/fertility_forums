I\u2019m going thru my second MC right now. We have no LC yet, and we started trying in Jan 2018 with just the back-to-back MCs in that time.\n\nAfter the first MC, my husband said he wasn\u2019t ready to try again. I was devastated. I wanted to TTC ASAP, which was a combination of hormones and my inner urge to correct what went wrong (even though I obv had no control over the MC). I started crying and said I have this urge in me that I cannot deny. He tried to understand and acknowledge that I have this intense drive to have a baby. He said ok and that he was onboard again. We accepted the fact that we were just the 1 in 4.\n\nThe first 3-4 months afterwards, my cycles were so screwed up and nothing happened of course. We started trying in earnest once cycles normalized for another 4 straight months. By this point, my husband was like why aren\u2019t we getting pregnant again? I could tell he was starting to get more into it...asking when we could test, when the FW was, etc. Then he started \u201cknocking on wood\u201d hoping I was pregnant. It was cute, but I was getting anxious. \n\nWe ended up getting pregnant that 4th cycle of very seriously trying, only to find out that it was another MC. This was a breaking point for the both of us. I couldn\u2019t stop crying, and he would get so frustrated seeing me so upset all the time and not working, letting the house become a mess, etc. He finally said \u201cI don\u2019t want to see you go thru this again. Maybe it\u2019s not meant to be that we have kids? Maybe we should look into adoption?\u201d It really triggered me, because we haven\u2019t don\u2019t testing or anything and until someone tells me I cannot have kids physically, then I will keep trying no matter what. It was super emotional at the time, but I didn\u2019t get into it with him and just let him sleep on it. I tried to get back into my normal routine and move on, even though I\u2019m still actively bleeding and in the perpetual waiting part. He ended up turning around and started bringing it up on his own- talks of future kids and hoping I\u2019m pregnant again soon. I\u2019m not really sure what happened, besides me not crying in front of him and trying to be normal - but I\u2019ll take it. He has told me he just wants to look forward. \n\nI\u2019m sorry I don\u2019t have specific advice for you, but just wanted to share my story in case it helps. Men handle things so differently and I have a feeling (without knowing full details of course) that your husband doesn\u2019t like seeing you so upset and he wants to protect you by not trying. One night my husband randomly said \u201cis my sperm causing miscarriages?\u201d So it made me realize these \u201crandom\u201d thoughts aren\u2019t so random, and they are trying to figure it out in their own way.
