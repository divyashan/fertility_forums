Was good for about two weeks and then got what I'm assuming is my first post MC period...except I still tested positive a few days ago, a day or so after I started my period. \n\nDoes that mean this isn't my period? Should I wait a few more weeks and then test again? I'm really frustrated because every time I go back to the doctor it's another $300 to throw at a child I never got to have. I just want to move on and start trying again but if I'm getting positive tests I'm assuming that's not even a possibility yet. Ugh.

I want to tell the story of this pregnancy because I want to honor the memory of our babies. They deserve to be remembered. I apologize for the length, but I want to remember everything while I can.\n\nI got my positive test after taking a test on a complete whim. I was so certain that I was out for this cycle that I was back to drinking caffeine, lifting things for our move, and I'll admit I had a small drink the day before the BFP. The next day over my lunch break, I took a wondfo because I was bored and I had to pee. I 100% expected a stark white BFN. I was floored when I got a faint line. Not even a squinter. Clearly positive. Of course, I immediately went out and bought more tests. \n\nI smile when I think back to telling my husband. He was in Las Vegas for work and when I told him not to freak out, he asked \"Why am I not supposed to freak out?\" He's always the calm, cool, and collected one in our marriage, so it was funny to think he was freaking out as much as I was.\n\nThe next morning, I had a no-questions-asked positive on a FRER. I was thrilled. I went to our new-home-orientation meeting on cloud nine that day, paying special attention to our future nursery. I called the doctor that morning too, and they were understanding that I wanted to come in before 8 weeks. My first appointment was to be at 7w1d. And they told me not to lift, meaning that my husband had to do all the lifting for our move. Poor guy had a lot of work ahead of him.\n\nTwo days later, my FRER line was as dark as the control and a Clear Blue Digital said 2-3 weeks. Things were progressing, which was a relief after my CP in January. They were also darkening quicker than my MMC back in April.\n\nFor the next week, husband and I were of course nervous, but we were so over the moon excited. We knew there was a possibility we could experience loss again, but things felt different this time. We had so much hope. We were moving into our new house and starting our family. \n\nThe first sign of spotting was at 4w6d. After a dog walk, I saw brown spotting in my shorts. There was no cramping, which was a sign of hope I held onto. The spotting was there on and off that day, but seemed to disappear if I rested. I felt terrible leaving my husband to do all the hard work loading the U-Haul, but he understood my worry and wanted what was best for me and our baby.\n\nOver the next week when we moved in, I would have intermittent spotting, mostly brown. I had red spotting the evening after we'd had sex, but again, no cramping. It wasn't until Saturday night (5w5d) that I had some cramping. It wasn't severe, but it was enough to terrify me. I was hoping it was because I'd had a very active day.\n\nAt 5w6d, I had red blood and cramping. I called my OB and she recommended I go to the ER. At the ER, I got a 20 minute ultrasound and the technician had a really good poker face. She gave me no idea whether there was good news or not. Back in the exam room, after my husband kept messing with the lifting/lowering pedals on the hospital bed to keep me annoyed/occupied, we got our results.\n\nThe doctor said he saw two gestational sacs, but no babies yet because it was still early. Ectopic pregnancy was thankfully ruled out. He also said my HCG was high, which also pointed toward twins. I'll admit, even though we knew it was so early, my husband and I got our hopes up for twins. Again, we were excited.\n\nMy excitement was very limited however, because I kept passing tissue and brown blood that day. I was hoping so much that it was just because of the none-too-gentle ultrasound I'd had. The next day when I called the OB, they wanted me to come in for a follow up because the ER I'd visited was out of their network.\n\nThe morning of my ER follow up appointment, I woke up to abdominal cramping. I saw red blood and felt like things were most likely over. My husband was sad right along with me, but we both decided that we wouldn't accept it was the end until the doctor said so.\n\nAt the doctor's office, I was an emotional disaster. Seeing woman with her two children and hearing her say she was newly pregnant with her third made me cry. I cried a lot that morning, even when the nurse asked to take my blood pressure. \n\nThe doctor I saw was great. It was the first time I'd been seen by him, but he was the only one available at short notice for the appointment. He listened to everything I had to say and asked plenty of questions. I never felt rushed or that my concerns weren't being addressed. He didn't seem too optimistic based on what I'd said, but he ordered HCGs. He also gave me the option of having another ultrasound. He said since it was only two days since my last that I may not see anything different, so he didn't want to force it on me.\n\nMy gut said to get the scan. I had to know if this was over or not. While we waited for the scan, my amazingly supportive husband was doing all he could to keep me distracted and in good spirits. He pulled up \"silkie chickens\" on Instagram because I think they look adorable/hilarious. He always knows how to make me smile, even in the most stressful situations.\n\nAt the beginning of the scan, the doctor said he only saw one gestational sac. No twins. I felt gutted at that loss, but there was clearly still something on the ultrasound screen. There was still hope for a baby. And inside that gestational sac, the doctor said he saw a baby that measured 5w6d, which was only two days off where I was supposed to be. The nurse even pointed out the flickering that she said looked like the beginning of a heartbeat. The doctor asked Nurse Hilda's opinion on what he saw, and she said she was 98% sure it looked to be a developing baby.\n\nMy husband and I left that scan feeling cautiously optimistic. With a follow up appointment scheduled for one week later, we drove directly to the lab to get my blood drawn for beta HCGs. There was still hope for us to have a healthy baby. The doctor said that my bleeding and cramping was because I had passed the other gestational sac. I was officially diagnosed with a threatened miscarriage.\n\nMy betas came back the next morning having more than doubled. The doctor seemed optimistic on the phone, and our hopes rose as well. The next week it felt like my hopes were on a see-saw. I felt incredibly pregnant and had terrible nausea and cravings. I was peeing like it was my full time job. \n\nBut the bleeding never went away. I had brown bleeding every day until my scheduled scan. Sometimes it was heavier than others, and sometimes it was absent. It was difficult to believe everything was going to be okay, but I tried to stay with my husband and doctor's hopes.\n\nFinally it was time for my scan. When I mentioned my bleeding pattern, the nurse practitioner's face looked very concerned. This was the same NP that had been there for my other MMC. She is so comforting and I was glad to have a familiar face. The first ultrasound machine looked really old, and when she tried to use it, she said she didn't like it as much and wanted to get a more modern machine for me. I was able to see the screen before they took it away, and I didn't see anything other than a gestational sac. Of course, I knew I wasn't a doctor, so I couldn't know if there was more or not. By that point, most of my optimism was gone though.\n\nOnce we got the newer machine, it almost seemed like an exact repeat of the scan that diagnosed my MMC. She asked how far along I was supposed to be, and then showed me an empty gestational sac. I was instantly devastated and angry. I couldn't control my tears and my husband and I just sat there and hugged while we cried together.\n\nWe were in complete disbelief. THIS DIDN'T GET TO HAPPEN AGAIN. How could two healthy people have experienced a third loss in less than a year? What was wrong with me? I know life isn't fair, but THIS JUST ISN'T FAIR. \n\nWhen the NP came back, I asked all the questions that I'd written down. I had a sheet of paper and on one side, I'd written questions if there had been growth, and on the other, if no growth. I managed to ask all my questions about steps forward, future testing, and if there was anything I could do to have have this happen again.\n\nOnce again, I opted for misoprostol. I took my last dose earlier today and the pain is still so intense. The pain pills are at least numbing my emotional pain for the time being. \n\nSo now I have a slew of testing in front of me. I have a scan to check for any reproductive system abnormalities, and a bunch of blood tests that I need to get done. \n\nI am just at such a loss in life right now. I want so badly to be a mom, and I know my husband wants so badly to be a dad. We bought this big house to start our family, and we are just so sad that that our nursery is empty and will be that way for a long while. We wanted so much to call our parents with good news, but instead had to call them and tell them that I miscarried again. \n\nI'm still in disbelief that this has happened again and I'm so scared of going through all the aftermath like I did earlier this year. I'm absolutely terrified of all my feelings when this all sets in. I'm scared to be back in that place and have even less hope than last time. \n\nThis time, I'm not keeping my loss to myself. I'm not the same person I was at the beginning of 2016 and I'm tired of people thinking I am. On Saturday, I'm going to light four candles for my loss in January, April, and my twins I just lost, and I'm going to let my world know about how loss has impacted my life. \n\nI know I have a difficult time ahead, but I'm so grateful I have this group to help me get through the dark days. \n\nThank you for reading my story.\n\nNo_this_is_patches\n\n\n\n", "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "ttcafterloss", "subreddit_id": "t5_34scd", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "My third loss", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/ttcafterloss/comments/577npi/my_third_loss/"}, {"author": "rawr7297", "author_created_utc": 1351455841, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_text": null, "author_fullname": "t2_9fqng", "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1476335032, "domain": "self.ttcafterloss", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/ttcafterloss/comments/578n3u/i_finally_had_the_courage_to_talk_about_my/", "gilded": 0, "id": "578n3u", "is_self": true, "locked": false, "media_embed": {}, "num_comments": 17, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/ttcafterloss/comments/578n3u/i_finally_had_the_courage_to_talk_about_my/", "retrieved_on": 1480228415, "score": 16, "secure_media_embed": {}, "selftext": "I've had two miscarriages this year and about 5 years ago I had another. Total I've been pregnant 4 times. My son is the only child I've been able to carry to term. I've only recently been open about our losses. I made one very small mention on Facebook about it and then at a mom group I go to. My god mother saw the Facebook thing and messaged my mother saying she thinks I'm a good mother but I'm lost. Now in the past I've made posts about being pro choice. I personally could never terminate a pregnancy My mother told her that I had miscarried three times and that two of those were this year the first in April and the second in July. I've known this woman all of my life and I had hoped that she knew me and my mother better than that.\n\nThese have been incredibly hard. My due date is coming up for the first one and I'm really struggling right now. I should be pregnant getting ready for our new child. Not grieving the loss of two pregnancies. Today my god mother had lunch with my mother. She started out by giving my mom a 10wk sized fetus, asked my mom to give it to me and talking about how concerned she is that I am pro choice. That she prays for me and hopes that I'll find my way back to god. She said by being pro choice I'm marked by the terminations that have already been committed. \n\nI'm very hurt that she took it upon herself to come after me after finding out this information. What kind of Christian jumps on a mother who is still grieving the loss of her children. She fucking tried to give me a tiny fetus. Either she was just assuming I terminated or she was trying to use my miscarriages to change my political beliefs. I'm not sure how to respond. I snapped at my mother for even telling me and I cried a lot. What the fuck do I say? I haven't talked about my miscarriages up until yesterday this makes me feel like I was right just holding all of this in. The thing that gets to me the most is how selfish this is. Shes trying to manipulate me through these losses. Any way you look at it she was trying to take the three miscarriages and use them to her advantage. Why the hell would you ever try to give a grieving mother a tiny replica of the baby(s) she lost. It makes me sick just thinking about it. I think I'm going to cut her out of my life.

It was extremely difficult, in fact *much* more difficult than I anticipated. I decided to post on Facebook about it given the significance of this month and being 2 days shy of October 15th. I also shared along with it (maybe as my way of disguising my vulnerability) a project I've been working on that was inspired by my miscarriages. Anyway, it's long as hell but I wanted to share it here for anyone who is interested. &lt;3 Love to you all.\n\n\"October is Miscarriage and Baby Loss Awareness Month.\n\nI\u2019ve been relatively open about my experience, but I think we have a long way to go to normalize the conversation and remove the stigma of discussing pregnancy loss (made evident by the fact that I not only removed more than a dozen people but also edited this 15 times before posting).\n\nI know that some people choose to remain silent not out of shame. There are so many others who could use an outlet outside of anonymous internet forums, but feel uncomfortable or ashamed to talk about it because it\u2019s still taboo even though it\u2019s so common; so common that more than 20% of pregnancies end in miscarriage, and factors like lifestyle, diet, quality of genes (see: Beyonce), and stress don\u2019t have a thing to do with it despite what some people assume.\n\nI happen to be totally comfortable talking about my experience, especially if doing so may provide support and let someone know, in the midst of this sad, isolating, and confusing experience, you are not alone. Your story might make people sad, uncomfortable, or tongue-tied, but if it\u2019s aching to be told, share it.\n\nI\u2019m sharing this today because not only is October miscarriage awareness month, earlier this year we lost a baby that would have been due today, October 13th. I have shared with very few people that we have also lost 2 pregnancies since then. Yep, I am now a card-carrying member of the recurrent pregnancy loss club, and it doesn\u2019t come with any exciting benefits if you can believe it.\n\nI\u2019ve learned this year that a lot of people don\u2019t know how to respond after hearing about a loss of this nature. (Side note: I was lucky to receive a lot of loving support, but I have experienced the ugly too). It\u2019s a confusing situation that everyone treats and views differently. No one knows the exact right thing to say and a lot of the time, well-meaning people say hurtful things in an effort to provide an explanation or hope.\n\nOthers dismiss it, perhaps thinking they are doing you a favor by not reminding you. But I know you\u2019re likely being reminded of it 100 times a day and maybe all you really could use is someone offering their ear so you can honor your baby\u2019s memory, talk about the magnitude of your loss, and your pain and anger over it; or vent about having to go to your follow-up doctor\u2019s appointments and sit in a waiting room full of huge baby bellies while trying not to fall apart, wondering if they\u2019ve ever been as unlucky as you.\n\nThrough the past several months, a rollercoaster of loss, grief, rinse, repeat, (among loads of other happy events for which I am thankful) I started compiling ideas from my own experiences and turned them into hand-painted cards. Mostly it was a way to aid in my own personal healing and fill my time with something healthy to distract from the fact that I\u2019m not preparing a nursery or shopping for cute onesies like I imagined I would be right now. I am also hoping to provide other women like me with appropriate support and empathy.\n\n[Here is a link to my small collection.](https://www.etsy.com/shop/channelfrida) They are entirely reflective of my own feelings (so be prepared for an F bomb or 2) and others\u2019 words that comforted me going through this experience.

It is National Pregnancy and Infant Loss Awareness Day, and although I rarely share anything personal on Facebook, I have decided that it's the perfect time to tell you all my story.\n\nToday, after 3 years of battling infertility, I should have been 12 weeks pregnant.  I was supposed to be planning a cutesy announcement to tell you all that SO and I were happily expecting a baby in April.  But sadly, 12 very painful days ago, I found out that I had miscarried and that this journey would only be getting more difficult.\n\nSome of you may already know this, but SO and I have been trying to conceive for nearly 3 years.  In 2013 we built our house with plenty of space for a family, and were SO excited to start trying once we got settled in.  It never really occurred to us that it would take more than a couple of months. \n\nAbout 8 months after we started trying, I was diagnosed with Polycystic Ovarian Syndrome, which makes it nearly impossible for me to ovulate.  I started taking some medicine that was supposed to help, and we continued on.  Several months and a few invasive tests later I was put on a fertility drug called Clomid, which gave me plenty of horrible side effects (intense hot-flashes, anyone?) but after 5 miserable cycles, I was still not pregnant.  Last August, we finally decided to consult with a fertility specialist, who told us that we would likely never conceive without In-Vitro Fertilization (IVF).  We were devastated at the expense, but at least we knew that we had a plan.  I was scared to go through all of the tests, the hormones, the daily injections, and the constant stream of doctors appointments, but we knew that it would all be worth it in the end.  In February of this year I underwent a painful egg-retrieval procedure so that we could start the IVF process, and in May we transferred 2 frozen embryos.  We were convinced that it would work...but it didn't.  It was hard knowing that even this level of medical intervention could fail, but saw it as a sort of trial run for next time. We took a bit of time off this summer, but I started again with the injections, hormones, etc. in preparation for our 2nd frozen embryo transfer this past August.  We just KNEW that our 2nd round would work, and I even did extra things such as acupuncture to boost my chances.  At the end of August, we were elated to find out that the transfer had worked, and we were officially 4 weeks pregnant!  After the crappy journey that had taken us here, we both knew we needed to be cautiously optimistic, but the fears died down after we heard a healthy heartbeat, and we began to really dream of the future for this child.  I started thinking about a registry, was excitedly looking up nursery decor, and we even put a deposit down on a daycare.  Everything was finally on track!  \n\nThe morning of October 3rd, at a routine ultrasound, four words changed my world forever.  \"There is no heartbeat.\"  Four words, and everything SO and I had dreamed of, everything we had gone through these past months, was all for nothing. At ten weeks, our baby had died. Sitting there in the doctors office, listening to options, and walking out into a waiting room full of blissfully pregnant women was probably the hardest thing I've ever had to go through.  I had a surgical procedure the next morning, and just like that, I was no longer pregnant.\n\nI wanted to share this story with you all, not for pity or prayers, but so that you hold your babies a little closer tonight and think about what this horrible day represents.  I want this story to make you thankful for the sleepless nights up with your kids, for the dirty diapers and the cancelled plans.  Because there are people out there who would do anything to stay up late holding a crying baby, instead of staying up all night crying for the baby they will never get to hold.\n\nI wanted to share this story so that you would think twice when you ask someone why they haven't had kids yet, or ask when they plan to start trying.  It hurts when you ache to be a mother with your entire being and some stranger won't stop pestering you about your biological clock, or tells you how selfish it is to be childless.  I want you to realize that a mother of a toddler may desperately WANT to give her child a sibling but simply cannot (secondary infertility exists too).  I want you to realize that it's not always that easy.  Trying to make a baby is not always fun.  No amount of \"just relaxing\" will give an infertile woman a child when even miraculous medical intervention has failed.  Even the most innocent questions can cause a tremendous amount of pain for someone struggling with losses or infertility.\n\nStatistically, 1 in 4 pregnancies will end in a loss.  For some reason, people tend to sweep these losses under the rug, hide their pain and their stories as if they were in some way taboo.  But I want to break the silence and start a conversation.  1 in 8 women in the US suffer from infertility, and yet most of us never speak out about our condition, afraid that our stories might be viewed as shameful. Afraid of being perceived as flawed. But I personally believe that suffering in silence is unnecessary, and feel that the support I've gotten during my struggle has been priceless. \n\nI know that our loss happened relatively early, and I'm sure it cannot compare in pain to stillbirth, infant death, or even later-term losses. But this baby was real to us, and so very loved and wanted. This journey has taught us both a great deal about ourselves, about our marriage, and about our respective internal strengths. SO has been an amazing support system throughout all of this, learning to give me shots, and helping me cope with the physical and emotional side effects of the process. His dedication and empathy have made me hope, more than ever, that he will finally get to become a father someday soon.\n\nWe will do another round of IVF in a while and hopefully it will all work out in the end...but I will always remember this pregnancy, and the baby that we never got to meet.  I know that SO and I are young and healthy and that statistics are generally in our favor. But the journey sucks, and it's painful and overwhelming and outrageously expensive. I'm just hoping that sharing this will make things a little bit better...for myself, and for all the other couples out there struggling with this painful reality and the heartache it brings.\n\n#infertility #miscarriage #october15th #pregnancyandinfentlossawareness\n#hope", "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "ttcafterloss", "subreddit_id": "t5_34scd", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Came out on FB today (October 15th)", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/ttcafterloss/comments/57lzjk/came_out_on_fb_today_october_15th/"}, {"author": "kortiny", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_text": null, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1476537967, "domain": "self.ttcafterloss", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/ttcafterloss/comments/57m1dy/what_are_hard_year/", "gilded": 0, "id": "57m1dy", "is_self": true, "locked": false, "media_embed": {}, "num_comments": 1, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/ttcafterloss/comments/57m1dy/what_are_hard_year/", "retrieved_on": 1480235812, "score": 8, "secure_media_embed": {}, "selftext": "In May this year, I lost my first pregnancy at 5 months along.

Here's my post though\n\n*****\n\nToday is National Pregnancy and Infant Loss Awareness Day. I posted a few weeks ago, but it was restricted to my friends, so now I'm making my public post to help spread awareness about what is so often taboo and suffered in silence.\n\nSome of you know that I adore the nunber 3. It's my fave number, as dorky as that sounds. I have some residual OCD, and 3 often plays into that. Imagine my joy at finding put I was pregnant on September 3rd in my 3rd cycle of trying. It was the day before my wedding anniversary and I'd intended to test on them but got impatient.\n\nIf you've never been pregnant, I can't truly describe the joy and terror that comes with seeing those 2 pink lines, no matter how faint. I took a ridiculous number of home pregnancy tests over the next week and told my family, my close friends, and some of you FB lovelies. I woke up every morning smiling so hard because I was pregnant.\n\nAll the while, however, I was panicking to myself. I was obsessing over the possibility of losing the baby. You see, I've literally always felt like I wasn't going to keep my first baby. I can't explain it, it's just a bone deep knowledge I have felt for YEARS. It didn't help that my due date was in May and May is my cursed month. So much sadness happens then so it naturally ramped up my anxiety. I tried to ignore the apprehension and as the weeks crawled by, my chances for a miscarriage lowered and I let myself hope.\n\nThen came the spotting. It was light at first, but I sobbed hysterically. I knew it was the beginning of the end. Everyone told me I was overreacting and that it was normal. So many anecdotes about how it happened to people and they had healthy pregnancies. I knew I wouldn't be one of them.\n\n3 days after the spotting, I took a Clear Blue Digital with Weeks Estimator and it didn't say I was as far as I should be. Again, everyone told me they're not accurate or maybe I was slow tonprogress, but I knew. It hurt that almost no one seemed to take my fears seriously. Then came more spotting and cramping so I went to the doctor. He said the same things others had, did an exam, and drew blood. He said as of right then, it looked like I hadn't started miscarrying. I let myself feel hope and relief. Then the cramping got worse and not even my husband could deny things.\n\nOn a Friday morning on what should have been my 6th week of pregnancy and almost 3 weeks after that first positive test, I miscarried at home. The feeling of knowing what was happening was indescribable. I'd been right all along and I was now a member of a club no one should have to join.\n\nI posted on FB and got a crazy amount of support and love. Truly, I couldn't ask for more supportive friends. A heartbreaking number of you have been in this position and you're all amazing &lt;3 \n\nI hope by sharing my story, it helps someone else because this has been such a lobely road. It doesn't matter how many others have suffered this, you still feel alone in your grief, esp when it's an early loss. Some people seem to think it's easy to move on after an early loss, but it's agony sometimes. It's getting easier though.\n\nTo everyone who has lost their baby, I'm so sorry. To everyone who hasnt, I'd never wish this pain on my worst enemy.

Our due date came 2 days ago and in my mind we'd honor the day and move on as we have been. \n\nInstead I feel like I've been hit by a truck. Everything is a trigger and I find myself crying uncontrollably at least once an hour. I thought I'd been through the worst of it, but I never considered how hard it would be to pass our due date and have the true emptiness set in; the reality that not only have I not been pregnant the past 9 months, but I'm never going to meet our baby boy who I should be holding in my arms right now.\n\nAfter my first miscarriage, a girlfriend who'd had one the previous year sent me an email with these words about grief. I believe it originated on Reddit years ago and I don't know who shared it with my friend but I've read it over and over and over, especially on hard days. Maybe this has been shared before here but I am going to pay it forward and share it because it has comforted me so much.\n\n---\n\n\"Alright, here goes. I'm old. What that means is that I've survived (so far) and a lot of people I've known and loved did not. I've lost friends, best friends, acquaintances, co-workers, grandparents, mom, relatives, teachers, mentors, students, neighbors, and a host of other folks. I have no children, and I can't imagine the pain it must be to lose a child. But here's my two cents.\n\nI wish I could say you get used to people dying. I never did. I don't want to. It tears a hole through me whenever somebody I love dies, no matter the circumstances. But I don't want it to \"not matter\". I don't want it to be something that just passes. My scars are a testament to the love and the relationship that I had for and with that person. And if the scar is deep, so was the love. So be it. Scars are a testament to life. Scars are a testament that I can love deeply and live deeply and be cut, or even gouged, and that I can heal and continue to live and continue to love. And the scar tissue is stronger than the original flesh ever was. Scars are a testament to life. Scars are only ugly to people who can't see.\n\nAs for grief, you'll find it comes in waves. When the ship is first wrecked, you're drowning, with wreckage all around you. Everything floating around you reminds you of the beauty and the magnificence of the ship that was, and is no more. And all you can do is float. You find some piece of the wreckage and you hang on for a while. Maybe it's some physical thing. Maybe it's a happy memory or a photograph. Maybe it's a person who is also floating. For a while, all you can do is float. Stay alive.\n\nIn the beginning, the waves are 100 feet tall and crash over you without mercy. They come 10 seconds apart and don't even give you time to catch your breath. All you can do is hang on and float. After a while, maybe weeks, maybe months, you'll find the waves are still 100 feet tall, but they come further apart. When they come, they still crash all over you and wipe you out. But in between, you can breathe, you can function. You never know what's going to trigger the grief. It might be a song, a picture, a street intersection, the smell of a cup of coffee. It can be just about anything...and the wave comes crashing. But in between waves, there is life.\n\nSomewhere down the line, and it's different for everybody, you find that the waves are only 80 feet tall. Or 50 feet tall. And while they still come, they come further apart. You can see them coming. An anniversary, a birthday, or Christmas, or landing at O'Hare. You can see it coming, for the most part, and prepare yourself. And when it washes over you, you know that somehow you will, again, come out the other side.

Many of you may know about my story. I have PCOS and, as a consequence, I have long(ish) irregular cycles which (up until this point) are ovulatory, albeit late (CD22-25). I've had two early MCs this year, and I'm just getting further and further away from my goal and here's why:\n\nIn March I got my BFP. A nice DARK DEFINITE one. Then in late April I lost it. In June, I conceived again. Never got quite the line I saw for my first positive test, but I was definitely pregnant. Lost that one in July, but was put on progesterone during my luteal phase for future pregnancies to prevent loss. We got pregnant the first two times immediately. Then I had a two ovulatory cycles immediately after which were \"normal\" where I started progesterone at 3 DPO. No pregnancy with either of those cycles. I get it, it's about chance, and I get it that we were lucky to get pregnant the first two times. I can live with trying unsuccessfully for awhile knowing that I have the progesterone now.\n\nBut now here I am, and my temps are all over the place. Usually I get textbook ovulatory BBT charts. I started to get darkening lines on OPKs two days ago, but none were true positives and they've since faded. It's CD23 and I have no EWCM and no ovulation cramps like I usually get. Absolutely no clue what my body is doing. So I've gone from pregnant, to less pregnant, to just plain ovulatory cycles, to now what I think is going to be an anovulatory cycle. I'm going backwards and I just want to cry. I'm not overweight, I take my vitamins, I'm not sedentary, and (other than this TTC crap) I don't have a lot of major stresses in life. I just don't freaking get it.

I've been reading the posts on here.  It's crazy how many stories are exactly the same as mine. \n\nSo I found out I was pregnant on February 20th of this year. I went to the hospital because my blood sugars had been running really low for about 2 weeks (type 1 diabetic). Anyway, they did the regular urinalysis &amp; come to find out, I was pregnant. The hospital I was at didn't have a woman's center &amp; since I was automatically considered \"high risk\" because of my diabetes, they wanted to transport me to a woman's center immediately. I was just about to leave the hospital but I had to pee for the 50th time since I had gotten there. I was spotting. I called the nurse in top show her &amp; she said I had nothing to worry about. \n\nThey sent me to the woman center &amp; by the time I got there, the pain started coming. I was getting really light headed &amp; was bleeding significantly more. I told the ER nurses that I was pregnant &amp; that something was wrong &amp; they showed no sense of urgency. Now, after 6 hours of waiting in the waiting room, covered in blood nearly screaming in pain, a nurse finally comes out. She tells me she's just drawing blood so we can get results. I told her that I was covered in blood &amp; how much immense pain I was in. Again, no sense of urgency. I sat there for another 4 hours. \n(This is kind of graphic, I apologize.) At that time, I had already had the miscarriage. I body had already discarded the baby. My baby. I was no longer pregnant. \n\nBy then, I knew what had happened  (I went through this back in 2013). I just wanted to go home. But no, they proceeded to take me back (after nearly 12 hours of sitting in the waiting room) for testing. They did every test imaginable. \n\nThe worst part about it had to have been when they took me back for an ultrasound. The part most mothers look forward to, I was dreading the most. I knew there would be nothing to see at this point &amp; was just going to get my worst nightmares confirmed again &amp; again. The doctors gave me an estimate on how far along I might have been based on my hcg which at the time was 2200. They said I was anywhere between 10 &amp; 12 weeks. \n\nIt all happened so slow, yet so fast. I wish the time after I found out &amp; the time before I lost her (I believe it was a girl. My little princess.) was at least long enough so I could have seen her. Just once. Heard her heartbeat. Got a estimated date of delivery. Anything. \n\nIt's been 8 months now &amp; I still carry my pregnancy test around in my pocket every single day. It's my motivation. If I don't have \"her\" with me I feel lost. The pain seems like it gets worse, never better. My body can't take it, let alone my mind. My body is always convinced I'm pregnant, even if I know I'm not. That's the worst part.

I had my baby girl 2 days before the surgery date a year later. At the time of my miscarriage I was alone. My husband was away for work in another state, I had just come back from visiting family and I started bleeding heavily after doing a stretching session. I panicked and drove myself to the ER where I spent 6 hours alone, I was shaking in the waiting room trying not to lose my shit in front of all those strangers. My mom called my boss to come and take me home and stay with me until my husband could make it back.\n\nI did not want anyone but my husband. My mom wanted to come but I could not deal with her emotions and mine and my husband's. Plus they do not get along too well because he doesnt kiss her ass. I ended up taking a month off of work, I couldnt cope at all. A month later my mom came for a visit and left after a huge fight with my husband after 3 days. She was angry because I wasnt eating and was a nervous wreck. This was the first huge life altering moment in my existence. My husband has been to war and handled it better than I did, but I just shut down. I tried to fake it and obviously I failed. I went to counseling and learned to deal with my grief somewhat. It still makes me sad. Yet recently, when I was with my mom, we were talking about it and I started to tear up and she told me I needed to basically let it go and be over it. \n\nHow?! How do you say that to someone? My baby wasnt full term but he (in my mind) was wanted and loved and I was fucking devastated. I feel talking about it helps me heal more and more yet to say I need to let it go, while it may come from a good place is not helpful. How do I respond to a comment like that? My mom had brain surgery recently and if I told her to stop whining about her hair growing back she would be furious. How do you make others understand just because you cry about it doesnt mean you arent coping well?
