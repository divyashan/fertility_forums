I am now 17 dpo (with a normal 11 day luteal phase) and my period finally made an appearance this morning.\n\nAccording to all my obsessive googling it's normal to ovulate later than usual and thus have a longer cycle following a miscarriage, even an early one. I've also read it's common to have a shorter luteal phase that next cycle. But I can't find anything about having a longer luteal phase? \n\nMy fear is that it was another chemical pregnancy, and this may become a recurrent problem. I promised myself not to test this month until 18 dpo so I'll never know for sure. Should I assume it was, and talk to my doctor about it? Or is it more likely my cycle was just out of whack this month because of the mc, even though it was so early on (4.5 weeks)?

I really didn't expect them to constantly check in, but the lack of contact really shocked and hurt me. \n\nI no longer live in the same city but I was there visiting my family 4 weeks after my D&amp;C and ended up getting together with my two friends. They didn't even ask how I was doing! No mention of anything at all. It was like nothing had ever happened. I felt myself growing more and more angry and frustrated. Reflecting on why, I guess I feel that they were dismissing my feelings and minimizing what I had been through. Things were clearly very awkward between all of us and I haven't been in contact with any of them since. I'm really at a loss as to how to handle this. I know I should text them and tell them why I'm feeling upset, but at the same time it makes me mad that I'd have to do so. \n\nAnyway, sorry if I rambled!

My OBGYN asked me to see a RE.\n\n\n**Reproductive Endocrinologist**- suggested to do laparoscopic surgery to remove the fibroids. He also said we may have to have IVF later on if Fallopian tubes get damaged or scarring.  \nWe went for an second opinion, to a Gyn surgeon.\n\n\n**Gynecologic surgeon** - Thinks its safer in my case to go with abdominal myomectomy, even though he is well known robotic/laparoscopic surgeon, as the one inside cavity needs to be carefully removed and endometrial lining preserved. He thinks surgeon will have full/better control during the procedure to do a clean job and suture it well, so that it doesn't rupture during future pregnancy. He did not suggest IVF or anything yet and is optimistic everything will be fine afterwards, even though recovery time is slightly longer.\n\n\nHas anyone been in similar situation? How did you decide what type of surgery to have? Please share your experience .

Fair warning, this is just going to be a sadfest post. I was going to write in the TTC daily thread, but then realized that it was getting way too long. Any support or advice on anything would be appreciated.\n\nI intro'd myself about a month ago after I found out about my blighted ovum. D&amp;C went well, I guess, and I started tracking again with OPKs and HPTs when we passed the two week okay-you-can-be-normal-again mark. My doctor never tested my betas, so I literally have no clue where they were/are. I thought I followed my HPTs down to zero. I guess not.\n\nI'm sitting here now at CD 30 something, 8 months into this process, wondering why I'm even holding out hope anymore. Or wondering why we even started trying. My HPTs, which I thought were negative, have been giving me a constant shadow ever since I started using them again about a week ago. So there's still HCG in my system from the loss. Still. OPKs are waffling back and forth between positive and negative after a long string of being exactly the same lightness/darkness. I don't even know where to go with this. I don't know if I call my doctor, don't know what to say to her, don't know if I should just keep waiting for my period to come or what. It's been 5 weeks now, and I know it could take longer, but I've been dealing with 60 day cycles ever since coming off BCP last May, and I'm frankly just tired of the constant waiting. And I know that I shouldn't be because there are people who have it way worse than me. But I'm bitter. And I'm tired. And this is not fun.\n\nOn top of this, against all odds and expectations, I'm having an extremely difficult time finding a job for when I get out of law school due to the fact that I got supremely screwed over by the firm I had summered at twice. Law school debt is horrendous, and I'm terrified that I won't have a job to pay those loans off when they come knocking. My in laws thankfully have the means to help me out, and they will, but I feel so unbelievably ashamed, even though this entire situation isn't my fault.\n\nAnd on top of all of that, my 79 year old dad had a stroke over the weekend. He's back at home now and relatively fine, but I feel like I'm on borrowed time with him. It's fucking stressful. I love my dad and I don't want to see him suffer. \n\nThis was extremely long. I'm sorry. I just don't know what to do with all of this going on. I feel like I should give up TTC for the time being, but I'm also terrified that if I give up, whenever we do feel like we can try again, I'll have to restart the whole \"wait a year of not successfully having a healthy pregnancy\" thing again, and it'll just add stress all over. Sorry for the long sadfest.

I didn't have a lot of expectations, I really just thought it would be about the D&amp;C procedure itself and less about Toxoplasmosis, which is rare here. I expected the doctor to not really know when we could try again and he would send us to somewhere else, probably in a larger city. \n\nIt was mind blowingly good. I walked out SMILING. I purposefully wore dark eye makeup so I wouldn't cry, it was very helpful. The doctor is from Italy and I've heard he's very highly regarded. He said I'm the first person he's dealt with who has toxo since he left Italy - over there it's quite common but women get screened for it, while they don't here (NZ) He was impressed with my husband figuring out what it was and us pushing to get get tested. And at the end he APOLOGISED for not picking it up. I was so shocked by that - how would he have known?! I went to him for hyperemesis, I don't expect the guy to be a mind reader. But he was genuinely remorseful. \n\nWe had already cheated and asked for the pathology before the appointment and he's interpretation of it was the same as ours. He said it might not take the full year to be able to ttc so I will get monthly blood tests until my antibodies are down. He referred me to a dietician as well - I lost 20 kgs between weeks 12 and 17 in my pregnancy but then put some of it back on and i want my weight to be stable before we try again. \n\nAnyway it was a positive appointment, except for seeing a work colleague in the hall of the hospital and her 10 year old asking me what I was doing here. The mother didn't call her out either so I just kinda stood there not knowing what to say - I just said 'Just stopping by to say hello' IM BAD AT LYING. \n\n\nAlso, i wrote a post in BabyBumps before I miscarried about a run in I had with a member of hospital staff. You can find it (poorly linked because I'm on my phone) here: https://www.reddit.com/r/BabyBumps/comments/5i1epr/i_have_an_archnemisis_and_her_name_is_sharyn/\n\nWell I complained to the local health board and got my letter back today. It's a great apology but they wrote a paragraph about my miscarriage - it happened some time after that complaint so I find it kind of weird they reference it so much. It means the person writing the complaint has seen my medical records, and is not just following up on a complaint about poor customer service. I'm not really mad about it, it's just weird. I'm probably over reacting. I hope the woman knows I miscarried due to toxoplasmosis, a disease she literally laughed off. \n\nI have this weird way of thinking about happiness is life - like there are three pillars - career, health and family. Career encompasses finances, job satisfaction, education etc. Health is pretty simple and family includes my marriage. I've never been able to be happy with all three at once, usually one has to suffer in order for the others to be going well, and it mostly tends to be my health, taking care of myself ect. This year I want to be happy with all of them, but it's my career that's going to be the tough one. I still cannot even fathom going back to work. I went back last week for a coffee and my colleague forgot to let people know I was coming so i pretty much just ran to my office, only saw a few people, no one really spoke except for hello. It seems so pointless, but job is so unchallenging and unsatisfying. I had already gone on maternity leave so in my mind I wasn't going back - having to back is like a huge admition of failure to myself and others. So I need to focus on how to make this easier because right now I kind of sweat thinking about it. Tips would be appreciate if you have any! \n\n\nWoah this is long. Total vent as always.

After 1 year of trying to no avail, last year I had three failed pregnancies (1 at 7 weeks, 1 suspected ectopic, 1 chemical). Between losses 1 and 2, we were given the totally helpful diagnosis of \"unexplained fertility\" and my RE's best guess about the recurrent losses since then is \"hopefully just bad luck.\" However, since the 3rd loss he did suggest I take baby aspirin and progesterone every month (just haven't gotten pregnant since to see whether that helps!).\n\nAnyhow, after the 3rd loss, I wasn't willing to wait around. Because all of my miscarriages were technically chemicals in that they weren't found on ultrasounds, my RE didn't think a recurrent loss blood panel would reveal much. I disagreed, and we did our blood panel several weeks ago. \n\nThanks to some lab errors, our karyotype test was lost, so we had to redo it. But of the results that my RE has received, none were abnormal except my lupus anticoagulant result was \"indeterminate.\" I also re-did that test, but RE thinks that it's unlikely to be positive the second time around. (And given that the lab lost another test altogether, I wouldn't be surprised if the inconclusive result might be attributed to lab error as well.)\n\nFrom what I've read, the positive lupus anticoagulant thing does seem to be associated with later losses, like after 10 weeks or so. And I understand that a positive result falls somewhere along a spectrum of seriousness. But I wonder:\n- what's the deal with an inconclusive test? have you had one? \n- would being even \"a little bit positive\" for lupus anticoagulant possibly explain my \"bad luck\" so far?\n- with all three pregnancies, I bled enough to assume I had gotten my period, only to find out I was pregnant a few days later. Any connection between heavy implantation bleeding and clotting issues?\n\nI guess there's a little part of me that hopes this second test will be positive because it will at least give me an explanation and treatment for my problems. I know that's a dangerous line of thinking, but at this point I will take what I can get! Any advice or insight on these related issues would be so helpful.

We finally started doing testing for recurrent pregnancy loss and discovered I have a uterine septum which causes miscarriage because often the embryo implants to the septum (which is usually located in prime implantation territory of the uterus) and there is not sufficient blood supply to baby so it grows a bit and then dies.\n\nI felt relieved to have an answer, and a solution as we scheduled surgery for February 14 to have the septum removed. The most ridiculous thing happened, I found out I was pregnant by total accident on January 1st. We were preventing, but I ovulated 5 days early than normal and well, no one to blame but myself, we were not being careful enough. With all the effort I had to put into conceiving each time, I never thought I would ever have an unplanned pregnancy. But I thought, wow, maybe this is our miracle baby. After all, I'd read plenty of success stories of women with my condition and my doctor assured it's possible to go full term.\n\nI had 2 early ultrasounds. One showed that the embryo was off to the side and this made me feel so optimistic and confident, it appeared to be nowhere near my septum. The second ultrasound showed us measuring right on track with a strong heartbeat.\n\nToday we had a 3rd ultrasound, I should've been 7w2d but was measuring 6w5d with no heartbeat. My other 2 MMC only grew to just shy of 7w as well after establishing a heartbeat. I can't believe it. Four losses in 11 months. I can't stop asking how much more of this I can take. And why did this happen? The solutions were all in place and then I have to suffer yet again? Why? Life feels so unfair.\n\nI have to push my surgery back now because I need to be on hormones for 4 weeks prior, and I can't do anything until this is complete. I have a d&amp;c scheduled for Monday and we are going to test the tissue for the second time (first loss we tested showed normal results). And then after my septum surgery I have to wait 3 cycles to TTC. Knowing I can't possibly have a baby before 2018 is an overwhelming thought, this year has just begun. It feels so far away and it makes me so depressed, all the waiting.\n\nAnd I do worry about my fertility. I'm 34 and my follicle/egg count was on the low end of average when I was tested. I know I am getting ahead of myself and eventually I will chill out and accept it all. \n\nBut, fuck, today as I lay here partially in denial and still feeling pregnancy symptoms, it's just so hard.

My child never took a single breath.  My heart is shattered.  \n\nI couldn't bear the thought of being an active participant in his birth post his death, so I elected to have a c-section the day before his due date.   Healing from that has added additional physical suffering but I think it spared me some emotional torment.  \n\nMy husband and I are both obsessing about having a second child, which has its own difficulties\u2026 we had only wanted one child and for me it feels like the one I wanted is the one I lost.  It's hard to transition all of my hopes and dreams to a sibling.  Also, since Max was carried to term, the medical recommendation is to wait 18 months prior to trying again.  That time seems infinitely far away.  But he taught us both that we want a child more than we ever could have imagined.\n\nI know I need a lot more time to heal, grieve, and mourn.  I haven't yet opened the door to his nursery.  I can't begin to think about what to do with all of his things, so many of which were hand made with care.  \n\nMaking it through most days one breath at a time\u2026 hoping that things will get easier with time.  The best part of every day has been looking at pictures that a nurse so kindly took for me, but I'm constantly struck by the realization that none of the people who would have been banging down my door for living baby pictures will ever ask to see him.  Dead baby pictures are taboo.  But he was perfect, and I want him to be seen.  I had a difficult pregnancy and worked so hard to grow and nourish this little human\u2026 and after all of that effort, and all of this pain and suffering, I want people to feel like he was as real as I do.  Photo sharing sort of gives me that.  So for any of you lovely new loss friends that are able to look at my son, I've linked a cherished photo of him below.

We had been using the \"rhythm\" method, plus he always pulled out. (Sorry if that's crass.) Honestly, I thought it would always work, because it had for so many years. I was panicked, and horrified. For about 3 days.\n\n\nThen I was in love, and planning the baby's entire future. I felt like I'd woken up a different person, whose life's purpose was to be mother to this baby. My husband and I were over the moon.\n\n\nAt 19 weeks and 1 day, I lost my son to an incompetent cervix. His name was Luke. He was perfect, and my body failed him.\n\n\nSince then, I have gotten pregnant four times: one chemical pregnancy, and three missed miscarriages. \n\n\nSo I am extremely bitter, and fucking angry, and have lost all belief in any kind of God. I feel like I have failed my husband, who so deserves a child. He is 6 years younger than me, so I feel like I stole his chance to be a father. \n\n\nI also feel like life has lost its purpose. I am not suicidal, just simply don't see what there is to look forward to. Most of us measure our lives in milestones, personal ones, then the ones of our children. But without children, what then? I am where I want to be in my career, and happy in my marriage, and have nowhere to \"go\" from here. Nothing to strive for.\n\n\nOf course we will try until I hit menopause, but I don't have much hope left to muster. No, I don't want to adopt, I want my *own* baby, a piece of my husband and me. I want to watch my child's personality develop and try to decide where he or she got which trait. I *deserve* it. But I don't think it will happen, and for this I feel like I am wasting my husband's life. And my own, to be truthful.\n\n\nI just want everyone to fuck right off most days. But I have to go to work. And no one wants to talk about all my dead babies. No one says his name.

I'd like to know if my story of physical (emotional is a whole other thing- I'm still waiting for a day where I don't cry) recovery is similar to others.\n\nI had a diagnosed Blighted Ovum at 8 weeks, two weeks ago. I'm 30 and we were trying for three cycles. Long and horrendous story short (I'm sure you all know these), I was showing no signs of miscarrying naturally, so I took 4 cytotec vaginally and passed a lot of blood and the sac within four hours and continued to bleed for the next two days. Two days later, and a very reassuring talk with the gynaecologist at the hospital, they found that I still had some blood and tissue inside. Five days of oral cytotec and rest were ordered (I bled and cramped painfully the whole five days, but nothing compares to the first vaginal dose). I went back in to my gynaecologist for a check-up once the medication was finished and my doctor found that it still wasn't all out. After conferring with the hospital, she told me that I have too little fluid and tissue left for a D&amp;C (12mm, apparently 16mm or more is the threshold). She said I will stop bleeding and that my next period will be awful, but to call her after that.\n\nI don't bleed as much anymore, but I still pass tissue at times and a little blood. I need to wear a pad, but never come close to filling even half of it. Hormonally, day 14 after the first dose of cytotec, I felt really good. I suddenly wanted to have sex for the first time since then (can't because of risk of infection and.... eww) and felt just overall just good. But today (day 16) I took a pregnancy test (POAS) and it was still positive. I really want to start trying after I get my next period, but not knowing how long I will have to wait is really difficult for me. \n\nIs this all (occasional bleeding and passing tissue, positive pregnancy test) what people have experienced after losing a pregnancy medically after 8 weeks?

I feel like I am officially losing my shit, and it is time for me to emerge from the shadows of lurking. I have been reading this sub since my first loss in May of 2015, but I guess I didn't feel seasoned enough to contribute or be worthy of sharing.\n\nI hope I did the trigger portion correctly... I have two boys (9 and almost a year), as well as three losses. Two of the losses were confirmed by physicians. One was a chemical that I tracked on tests at home. \n\nMy husband and I had an accidental pregnancy while I was on the low dose pill (son one). Then eight years of lazy pregnancy prevention that never resulted in a second child. We divorced, and about a year later I had a condom failure (I'm guessing) with my significant other. This resulted in a loss at 6 weeks 4 days. It was brutal, isolating, and only my SO and two friends knew. \n\nI was depressed and in a hole afterward. Prevention was not on my mind; I could barely make it to work and function for big kid. Pregnancy number two with SO came two months later and resulted in a son who is almost a year.\n\nI had a chemical pregnancy in July, which I kept to myself and handled surprisingly well. Then I found myself with a positive test two days after Christmas. I was picking out an announcement shirt for the little one and planning how to surprise my SO. January 1st was a day of excitement for the new year and hope for my family. I was testing twice a day and comforted by darkening lines.\n\nJanuary 2nd was cramping, spotting, and tears. I knew from the first streak that it was over. My primary care provider was atrocious and told me they wouldn't draw labs and to go to the ER. I couldn't afford the ER, so I went to an OB who confirmed the loss and offered to prescribe me Clomid (?!).\n\nI told myself no more. No testing. No unprotected sex. No thoughts of babies. Just no. So here I am on CD30 post MC, fourth day in a row of testing, feeling crazy every time I see a negative. I don't know where to go from here, but I think it's time to start opening myself to both giving and receiving support through this unpredictable process.

I lost my first baby, my boy Riyad, at 38 weeks on November 3rd. I had a perfect pregnancy. Low blood pressure, did everything I had to and more (DHA supplements, exercise, you name it)...and his heart just suddenly stopped beating one day. Never in my wildest imagination would I have expected to have a full term stillbirth. We never expected our baby would die so late in the pregnancy. \nI was at my OB for my 38 week check up two days before I found out my baby died. The heartbeat was perfect, he was in position for labor, and I was starting to dilate. We talked about packing a hospital bag. He was moving a little less but everyone told me it was normal because he was running out of space and labor was coming! So I believed it was fine. Looking back I think he died a few hours after my doctors appointment. I went to the mall with my sister and walked around a bit, and started to feel strong cramps. So I stopped and rested. Then he started kicking like crazy and I made a snarky comment to my sister about how crazy active he's being. I thought nothing more of it. \nThe next day I woke up and suddenly burst into tears. I was extremely emotional for no reason--first time I started crying like that in my entire pregnancy. My husband was concerned and asked if I needed to go to the hospital. I said no, the baby was fine. I chalked it up to nerves about being a new mom. We installed the car seat that day and put together the stroller....and the whole time I barely felt my baby move. I would later find out what I thought was him moving turned out to be phantom kicks and shifting due to the amniotic fluid. I had no idea. I was worried about him being less active but still I thought he was lazy because he's most active at night. Night came and he was still \"lazy.\" This is where I feel most guilty. I kept telling my husband I'm fine. Although I appeared very nervous and moved my stomach around several times. I went to l&amp;D a lot for little reasons that turned out to be nothing. I didn't want to look like a paranoid mom, we had just went to the doctor, and I was so sure he was fine.\nWe went to L&amp;D the next morning just to be sure he was ok, and they couldn't find a heartbeat. I gave birth to him. They told my husband he was gone for at least 24 hours based on his appearance. I was too drugged up and in complete shock to really do anything that day. My OB thinks it was a Silent Placental Abruption that came out of nowhere and took his life. There was a clot on the placenta that must have made it detach and deprive him of oxygen. I have no risk factors. I've been tested for clotting disorders with everything coming back negative. \nThis is the hardest thing I've ever had to go through in my life, and I don't have a solid answer as to why my son died. It tears me apart. The guilt eats at me. I should have gone as soon as I thought it was weird he wasn't moving as much--but everyone tells me there was nothing I could have done and most likely he was gone by the time I noticed. \nI want to get pregnant again. I met an MFM and she told me she sees no reason for me not to get pregnant again. She has two patients who are pregnant now who had full term stillbirths who will be delivering healthy babies any day now. I know this will help me heal but I am terrified of the thought of another sudden death. I'm in limbo and drowning in grief.

Like, can we just let these babies pass peacefully? Every 48 hours I go in for more bloodwork and thus every 48 hours I'm slammed in the face with all the happily complaining pregnant women in the obgyn office and the cold hard numbers of how my body failed me. See,I didn't take a pregnancy test when I knew I was pregnant. I had all the same symptoms of my last two pregnancies, but we have a child with sleep apnea who literally didn't sleep more than 3 hrs at night and a high energy toddler who doesn't sleep through the day. I was a little preoccupied to pay close attention to my body when I hadn't even had a period post Baby2. Then we had emergency surgery on Baby2 last week. I ordered tests off of Amazon because I'm cheap and tired. They came in on the day I started miscarrying. On Thursday last week I passed my twins. Two little tiny humans. I am in a super weird place right now. My sadness comes in waves. It's pure, iron hot, fierce despair and sadness, mixed with the little joys of having two toddlers in the house. We went to the zoo yesterday and we had so much fun, but today I woke up crying because my dreams were cruel to me. \n\nA few people have said to me that I can't bee too sad because I didn't even know I was pregnant. Well, sure, I hadn't taken a test yet, but I knew. I knew I was pregnant, I was just ignoring it to care for the needy kids I have. I seriously thought to myself \"if I'm pregnant, it'll take care of itsself. Baby2 needs me more than the one inside me.\" All that wasn't true, because I miscarried because of rock bottom progesterone levels. With both my other pregnancies I had to take progesterone pills to keep the pregnancy viable. WHY DID I THINK THIS WOULD BE DIFFERENT??????? This pregnancy ended because I wasn't diligent. I was tired. I was lazy. I'm so mad at myself.
