I had my D&amp;C four weeks ago followed by nearly two weeks of spotting that slowly decreased, and am trying to determine if what I'm experiencing is my first period or not. \n\nMy periods are usually 1-2 days heavy bleeding with strong cramps, then 4-5 days of decreasing bleeding. For the last 4 or so days I've had light bleeding. No cramping at all, which never happens with my period - I ALWAYS have killer cramps. I had moodiness (shocking) and a few breakouts on my face also typical for my period. But this bleeding is light flow, pinkish red color (nothing dark or brown) like what I'd expect a day before my period really hit - but nothing big ever came. At first I thought possible implantation symptoms, but it seemed it was more light bleeding than just a bit of spotting. According to my BBT tracking and monitoring cervical mucous (I don't remember all the acronyms for this stuff), I did ovulate but then started light bleeding roughly six days after that. Thoughts? Random mid-cycle bleeding post D&amp;C or is this an actual period? What was y'alls first periods after your D&amp;C? I've read most women have a hellish first period after a miscarriage, so that makes me wondering what my body is doing since it's not super obvious to me. Just trying to move on and figure this out.

Have had it for many, many years now. I am obese, and all interventions to help bring my weight down have failed. I have had two miscarriages in the past three years, and last year we went through a long and expensive IUI battle that ended with nothing. IVF is not an option. The kicker is that I can produce eggs (thank, Clomid), and my husband has good sperm, so it's really like unexplained infertility once you get to this point.\n\nI have tried to be open about my later term miscarriage. I want the people around me to know that I once was pregnant, and that it sucked going in every week for ultrasounds and getting bad news. I guess I've also been open about that because I feel left out of the whole rite of passage that is pregnancy. \n\nAs a result, whenever a friend is pregnant, they usually let me know first, privately, before posting their announcement online. This, I guess, is a blessing and a curse. I'm glad they spare me the trigger of their too-cute-to-stand announcement photos, and the inevitable profile picture switch to sonogram mode. But I am also angry that they feel like I'm so fragile that they have to consult me before posting their news. I just get angrier when I realize that they're right, and that I'm going to be bitter, angry, and cry when I get the news, no matter when.\n\nI am so pissed, guys. I'm angry that another friend is getting to have a baby. I'm angry that my body is so fucking destroyed that it can't function properly. I'm angry that I can't get the help I need medically to help me lose weight, which I'm told would make it SO EASY (sarcastic doctor voice) to get pregnant. I'm especially angry that they get to post their pictures and get the world's approval- that they will have 300 acquaintances tell them, in 24 hours, how incredibly special they must be, and how great they'll be as parents.\n\nI'm so over it. I'm violently angry, but I feel like I have no space in which to let it all out. That's why I'm here, I guess. I even created a new account so that I could talk about it without risking discovery by the very friends who think I'm delighted. I figured if anyone must know how I feel, it will be women who have had the pinnacle of womanly experience placed right in front of them, within arms reach, and then have had it snatched away, never getting the experience of reveling in their pregnancies. \n\nI hope there's a next time for us. I hope someday we'll get to change our profile pictures, too. Maybe I'd feel differently about the news I'm getting if I knew there was a struggle involved. But I don't really want to get into humanizing these mothers-to-be; I just want to be delivered of the red hot, burning ache that is filling my heart right now. \n\nThanks.\n*****RANT CONCLUDED********", "stickied": false, "subreddit": "ttcafterloss", "subreddit_id": "t5_34scd", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Why Do People Feel Like They Need My Permission To Post Pregnancy Announcements?", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/ttcafterloss/comments/4zv4kq/why_do_people_feel_like_they_need_my_permission/"}, {"author": "Im_a_female", "author_created_utc": 1324937295, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_text": null, "author_fullname": "t2_6inzt", "created_utc": 1472325162, "domain": "self.ttcafterloss", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/ttcafterloss/comments/4zvppp/onto_cycle_13first_real_cycle_trying_after_my/", "gilded": 0, "id": "4zvppp", "is_self": true, "locked": false, "media_embed": {}, "num_comments": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/ttcafterloss/comments/4zvppp/onto_cycle_13first_real_cycle_trying_after_my/", "retrieved_on": 1473085538, "score": 4, "secure_media_embed": {}, "selftext": "Well this cycle was my first one trying after my miscarriage.

Warning- this turned into wall of text, sorry. I didn't realise how much i needed to get it all out.\n\nOne week ago today, my waters broke and  I gave birth to my ID twin girls, Chloe and Cara at 24 weeks.\n\nThis was my first pregnancy,  and we were shocked when it happened after only 3 months of NTNP. My mother and all of my sisters have had fertility issues and miscarriages, so I had prepared myself for a long wait. At 8 weeks, we found out it was twins and we couldn't have been happier. Everyone else would only tell us how hard it was going to be, and how we would need so much help, but we were over the moon.\n\nI knew the pregnancy was going to be high risk because the girls shared a placenta. I read all about TTTS, and was worried about it, but I told myself it only affects 10% of monochorionic twins- that's a 90% chance that we will be fine!\n\nEven so, I was cautious. We had scans every 2 weeks, and I was so nervous before each one. My mother was on my back about planning a baby shower, getting the nursery set up, getting ready, but I didn't want to buy a single thing for fear of jinxing it.\n\nWhen I was 19+5,  I bought a pack of diapers and wipes which were on sale. At 20 weeks on the dot, I went in for a scan and found out the girls has TTTS Stage 1. I KNOW its stupid and illogical, but I wish so badly that I could go back in time and not buy those diapers- would that have changed anything?\n \nWe went through a rollercoaster with TTTS. Within a week, they went from Stage 1 to Stage 3. Initially, we were told laser surgery was the way to go- that gave both babies a 60% chance of surviving, and 85% of one surviving. Then at 21 weeks we were told that we couldn't have laser surgery because my placenta was completely anterior and they had no place to enter. Baby A's brain was showing ventriculomegaly which meant probable brain damage, and our dr had little hope of either of the babies surviving, and if they did they would likely be disabled. He told us our options were to terminate or to wait and see if they survive.\n\nMy husband and I decided to wait and see, to hopefully make it to 26 weeks for an MRI and see what the damage was like before making a decision. At 22 weeks, our ultrasound showed a slight improvement- our donor baby had a visible bladder which we hadnt seen for 2 weeks, and her dopplers were normal. They had gone from Stage 3 back to Stage 1.\n\n3 days later, I lost my mucus plug. Went to Emergency, they checked for amniotoc fluid (none) and did a cervical exam (closed)  and sent me on my way with instructions to just attend my regular scan appointment on Friday.\n\nOn Friday, everything looked good. Still Stage 1, and the donor baby had a visible bladder AND a tiny amount of fluid! Cruelly, we began to have hope that both babies would be okay.\n\nTwo days later, my waters broke. I went straight to Emergency and was admitted. They did the test and confirmed amniotoc fluid. We had an ultrasound expecting the worst, but both babies had heartbeats and there was still plenty of fluid around the recipient baby. Our Dr said that there is a 50% chance of delivering in the next few days, but if we can avoid that then we may be able to keep them in until viability. Our dr had already told us at a previous appointment that although some babies can survive at 24 weeks, he was of the opinion that ours would not, and likely wouldn't be able to until 26-28 weeks. He reiterated that to us again that day.\n\nWe went back up to L&amp;D, and another Dr told us we needed to make a decision- they can give me steroids and commit to doing everything they can for the babies if I do go into labour. Or we can do nothing, and if labour happens then we let nature takes its course. We chose the second. It's a decision that I struggle with. Sometimes I think we did the right thing, and other times I wonder- would at least one of them still be here if we had tried? I don't know what the answer is.\n\nThey sent me from L&amp;D to the antenatal ward and said I would be here until birth, however long that may be. We were only in that room for a short time when I started getting pains. Were they contractions, the mifwives asked. Well, I don't know, I've never had contractions before. They said if they were contractions, they would come and go regularly and I would feel my stomach tighten. Mine pain was more constant at the start- they never really went away.\n\nAs I got more uncomfortable, they decided to take me down to L&amp;D again. \"Just in case\".\n\nIn L&amp;D, they confirmed that I was in labour. They gave me some endone for the pain, and one of the midwives told me that sometimes when your waters break, you can have labour that stops. Sometimes even the pain relief is enough to get labour to stop on its own. I focused on that, just hoping that it would stop on its own. \n\nNobody was really checking on me. I never had a cervical check after labour started. The pain moved from my belly to my tail bone- I had heard of 'back labour\" before, and I thought that was what I was experiencing. I paged a nurse, told her that the pain had moved lower. She gave me some Panadine Forte and told me the Drs would assess in 30 minutes. I waited about 10 minutes. I was feeling what I now know is the urge to push, but I didn't know it at the time. I paged the nurse again and asked for the Dr to assess now. He came in about 5 minutes later, got a speculum and sat down between my legs. As soon as he sat down he put down the speculum and said 'It's right there'. The next part is a bit of a blur, but our donor twin Chloe was born. Her nose was a bit squashed and her head was a funny shape - I believe she died in the birth canal, I had the push feeling for so long before they checked me. How I wish I had known to make somebody pay attention to me earlier- but I hadn't done any birthing classes yet, I didn't know what to expect or what I would feel.\n\nI held Chloe while we waited for Twin B, but my contractions completely stopped. I was put on a drip to induce and the Dr broke Cara's waters- there was so much, litres and litres. After an hour or so, Cara was born alive. She made a few tiny cries and I held her. One nurse asked if we were going to try and resuscitate and we had to say no. I kind of hate that nurse.\n\nCara lived for around 45 minutes and my husband and I got to hold her. She was so perfect. I was trying to birth the placenta but it wasnt happening. I could feel gushes of what I thought was fluid, but was actually blood. They told me I'd need surgery to remove the placenta. \n\nInitially I was going to have a spinal, but I kept losing blood and the anesthesiologist said I had to have a GA. They took me to the theatre and were prepping me, and I was feeling really lightheaded. I told them so. Then I blinked and when I opened my eyes, someone had a mask over my mouth and I was gasping for breath. There were about 30 people in the room, and one of them was saying 'Code Blue Adult female...'. One nurse was holding my hand telling me I was going to be okay. I heard somebody say I had 'no outputs' for 30 seconds. I was scared. They told me they were going to put me under, and I remember thinking that I wouldn't wake up. I thought that at least I will be with my babies, but I felt so terrible for husband who was going to lose us all at once.\n\nThankfully though I did wake up. I had lost 2.5 litres of blood and needed a transfusion, but they didn't really have an explanation about why I crashed. My discharge paper list the reason as 'cervical shock'.\n\nI went back to my room and our families were there to meet the babies. I was so tired, I just wanted them to leave but didn't want to say so. I didn't want to hold the babies because I was scared that I would drop them, i was so tired.\n\nWe kept the babies in a cold cot with us for 2 days, but in hindsight I wish I would have spent more time with them in my arms. I think I was in shock- it wasn't until the last day that I realised that this is it- I have to leave them here. I will never hold them again.\n\nIts now been a week and I am just so sad- I just want to scream with it, i just want to go back in time to when they were with me.\n\nI can't stop thinking about TTC again. I want to start straight away, but I'm scared of how I will feel being pregnant again. Part of me is desperately hoping for twins again (the odds are very low), and part of me is terified that it will be twins and we will go through this again.\n\nI am scared that if we wait, we will have trouble TTC and we won't be able to have a faily. I'm scared that if we do get pregnant, I'll hemorrhage again and die.\n\nI am so full of contradictory emotions. I miss the girls so much already. Tomorrow is their cremation and I don't know how I will get through it.\n\nMy husband and family have been so wonderful but nothing helps. Sometimes I feel normal, and it feels so wrong. Sometimes I can't breathe with how much it hurts.", "stickied": false, "subreddit": "ttcafterloss", "subreddit_id": "t5_34scd", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Intro: Loss at 24 weeks", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/ttcafterloss/comments/4zwqxa/intro_loss_at_24_weeks/"}, {"author": "AutoModerator", "author_created_utc": 1325741068, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_text": null, "author_fullname": "t2_6l4z3", "created_utc": 1472367848, "distinguished": "moderator", "domain": "self.ttcafterloss", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/ttcafterloss/comments/4zye2i/ttcafterloss_ttc_daily_discussion_thread_august/", "gilded": 0, "id": "4zye2i", "is_self": true, "link_flair_css_class": "ttc", "link_flair_text": "TTC Thread", "locked": false, "media_embed": {}, "num_comments": 46, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/ttcafterloss/comments/4zye2i/ttcafterloss_ttc_daily_discussion_thread_august/", "retrieved_on": 1473086912, "score": 4, "secure_media_embed": {}, "selftext": "**This thread is for members who are TTC or waiting to try.

I was 24 weeks with an anterior placenta, they didn\u2019t seem very concerned.   They got me in and put a Doppler on my stomach, told me they could hear the baby\u2019s heartbeat and to not worry about counting kicks until I was 28 weeks.  I wish SO hard that I could go back in time to that day, to tell them to do an ultrasound or a stress test or anything to take me more seriously.  My baby girl was alive that day, and I felt a couple kicks the next day, but that was it.  I told myself it was all my placenta\u2019s fault and not to stress.\n\nI had a regularly scheduled appointment on August 19.  I told them about the lack of movement, but again they didn\u2019t seem too concerned.  The physician finally said \u201cwell as long as you feel a little something every day\u201d and that\u2019s when my heart began to race.  I hadn\u2019t felt movement in days.  She did a Doppler check and told me that she heard a heartbeat but said \u201cLet\u2019s do an ultrasound just to make you feel better.\u201d  The ultrasound tech laid me down and initially was cheery but quickly got quiet.  I noticed the baby wasn\u2019t moving at all, I couldn\u2019t see her heart fluttering like it had just 5 weeks before at her anatomy scan.  The tech said the words no one wants to hear \u201cI\u2019m so sorry\u201d and after that I went into shock and just bawled for an hour until my husband could get there.  \n\nWe went to the hospital and got a second ultrasound, but it just confirmed the first.  They put me on an IV and gave me my first dose of Cytotec at 9 pm.  Nothing happened for a long time.  I was given more Cytotec every 6 hours.  My mom came from 2 hours away and I\u2019m so glad she was there for me and my husband; I was pretty out of it and so he had to do most of the talking to nurses and doctors.  24 hours  and 4 doses later he spoke with the doctor about his concern that things weren\u2019t progressing, and they quadrupled my dose.  Finally at 12:30 am on August 21 my contractions started.  I got an epidural and at 2:30 my water finally broke.  My baby girl Riley Elizabeth was stillborn at 3:06 am.  I had held out some tiny sliver of hope that they were wrong, that I would hear a cry when she came, but of course that didn\u2019t happen and it broke me over again.  \n\nMy husband, my mom and I all took turns holding her for a few hours.  We took pictures, which felt wrong at the time but now I am so glad we did.  She was perfect.  10 tiny fingers and toes, blonde fuzz on top of her head, nothing to tell us why she passed.  We still don\u2019t know.  The doctors suspect a cord accident, but there was no definite proof other than my placenta was functioning fine but she had no blood moving through her.  \n\nIt\u2019s been a little over a week and we\u2019re home now, in the big empty house we bought after learning we were pregnant.  I can\u2019t fucking function, waking up each day hurts all over again.  Everything I see around me is a painful reminder she\u2019s gone.  I don\u2019t have motivation to do anything.  It\u2019s a good day if I remember to eat.   My mind is going crazy, I am constantly thinking about how we need to have another baby but I\u2019m not even emotionally stable enough to shower at the moment so that seems a little premature.  I just want my baby inside me again.  I keep feeling phantom kicks and then I cry some more.  My milk came and went, but that just made me sad again.  \n\nAnd here\u2019s the real kicker: I am fucking surrounded by pregnant women all due at the same time I was.  My two best friends are due with girls a week before and after me.  Also due that month are my two neighbors, my cousin, and my coworker.

Immediately got a UTI following our first two times trying (fucking seriously body?)  I never got a positive read on the ovulation.  I got my period at exactly 4 weeks post surgery and I've been sort of in this downward spiral ever since.  I didn't ovulate, but got my period.  Who knows if I even ovulate at all! My mother is convinced everything down there is fine.  \"You're my daughter, you're very fertile.  I promise it'll be okay.\" But I just don't trust it.  With this baby, I only ever had ovulation symptoms (hot flashy, cramps) the month that we conceived him.  All previous 7 months that we were trying I don't recall getting ovulation symptoms.  I get a regular period though like clockwork.  \n\nI thought I would be okay with pregnancy announcements and seeing pregnant people, and I was for a little while, until I got this period.  I've been riding the ups and downs of some pretty severe depression since my TFMR but it really took a turn for the worst when I saw a pregnant mom with her 2-3 year old hugging her belly at TJ Maxx.  It was such a beautiful thing and I had to just turn and walk out and go cry hysterically.  \n\nTHIS BEHAVIOR IS NOT ME.\n\nI've unfollowed some pregnant friends on FB.  Once again, this isn't the normal me. \n\nAll I want to do is eat chocolate and comfort food, but I'm dieting to try to lose my pregnancy weight because being 25lbs over my normal weight has me unable to fit into any of my normal clothes so I'm stuck wearing maternity pants and it's making me miserable.\n\nMy OB gave me a referral to a therapist for post partum depression but I haven't called.  She also gave me a referral to a fertility specialist, but they couldn't even some see me until 2 months from now.  I booked the appointment and then hung up and cried my eyes out.  I'd rather my regular OB just prescribe me a round of Clomid and skip the fertility BS.  I just want to be pregnant again and CERTAIN that I've ovulated.\n\nIt has only been 5 weeks and we've only been TTC for less than a month and I'm freaking out.  You guys have all been trying for much much longer than me but I\"m freaking out over this.

We were over the moon! 8 week scan looked good with a strong heartbeat and some on-screen wiggles, and we more or less stopped worrying so much. After all, the doctor said we were essentially good to go after such a good scan so early.\n\n12 week scan came. The baby measured only 11 weeks and had no heartbeat. We had no clue. That was last week Wednesday and I finally started spotting on Saturday. The bleeding slowly increased over Sunday, Monday, Tuesday...finally Wednesday morning I went into labor. 9 hours later, the doctor said my cervix wasn't dilating at all and I needed a D&amp;C. Unbeknownst to us, in the time it took them to get the OR set up and all of that, my cervix did in fact start to dilate, but we didn't learn that until I was already under. The OB told my husband it probably would have taken it several more hours at that rate anyway and that the cervix dilating made the procedure easier, so I guess that's good? I'm mostly glad to know my body did eventually start to respond the way it's supposed to...\n\nThe remains are at pathology right now but we should get to bury her at the end of next week sometime. Chances are we'll bury her on or at least somewhere very near my 30th birthday on September 11th. (No, we technically don't know if it was a girl or not, but my husband and I both had a strong gut feeling she was going to be a girl and it feels better than saying \"the baby\" or, worse, \"it\" for the rest of our lives.) The doctors seemed to think it was a little...odd, for us to be so adamant that we want to bury her, to the point where I was even fighting against getting the D&amp;C at all until they could assure me that we would still get the remains in the end, but it means the world to us and I'm so, so, so glad I insisted on it even through everything. \n\nAt this point, honestly, I'm partly missing her terribly and feeling more empty than ever and crying more than I did the entire week leading up to this...and I'm partly thankful her body is out and we can start processing the next steps. We felt very...stuck, just sitting and crying and waiting for that week between the ultrasound and the D&amp;C. A burial isn't exactly the baby plans we wanted to make, but being able to do *something* is a help. I'm going to make a tiny baby quilt for the bottom of the coffin and my husband has taken on organizing everything with the cemetery.

We first made the decision to try in November 2014 and have been on again/off again trying since - diagnosed with PCOS and wondered what the point was for a few months, put too much pressure on ourselves, etc - before having positive test in early June while using Metformin/Provera/Clomid. The feelings that came up that day and after were indescribable. Had our first OB appt and learned I probably ovulated later than we thought, she guessed I was around 4-5 weeks and even thought she saw a second sac. We had our minds blown for the next week when we went back for another u/s and she said it's not growing as fast as it should but don't be alarmed. Went back the next week and she said still no heart beat and HCG levels in blood test were going down. She gave me time to consider passing naturally, ultimately had D&amp;C 7/15/6 (the day after the worst birthday I've ever had!) and I've been trying to grieve ever since. I learned a few weeks after the procedure that my SIL told my mom the day of that she was pregnant with their 3rd (my parents are the only family members who knew). I was crushed. I later learned they miscarried but we're very distant and haven't discussed. \n\nWe didn't tell many people and I still have mixed feelings about that - it's utterly isolating but I'm also glad I don't have to constantly talk about it with others.  There are so many assumptions and judgements about ttc and loss. I'm also super frustrated because we were 'in a really good place' right before testing positive. I was accepting that it wouldn't happen on my own timing, my husband and I were closer than ever, and life just seemed to be going well. It's challenging to try to put the pieces back together now. \n\nWe're trying to decide what the right timing is for us to start trying again. My OB  recommend I do Provera since I haven't had a period since then. I started spotting today and would usually start Clomid cd5-9. We're talking about it but I think we've agreed I'm going to give myself the grace to see how I feel about things on day 5 and try not to pressure myself (that's not an easy thing to do!). \n\nThings I've learned while working on the process of acceptance:\n-Things don't happen on your time - you don't decide to try and become pregnant the next week.\n-Stay hopeful. Hope gets you through. Mentally I was preparing myself for anything possible but I think I would have been more crushed without hope.\n-Someone voiced concern I may not have 'closure' with a d&amp;c like I would naturally miscarrying. That day was one of the worst. When they ask how far along you 'were,' how to handle the remains, and regularly say 'I'm sorry for your loss' (first time we'd heard it), the door of closure keeps slamming in your face. \n-Women must talk about this more. This has been one of the most isolating, despairing, shameful experiences I've ever been through. When the time is right, I'll open up with more friends/family. If we conceive again, I think I want to celebrate any part of that new life as early and long as possible. \n-Baby Center, Facebook, Enfamil (who knows who sold them my info), the freaking insurance company... They don't know you had a loss and want to slap reminders in your face regularly.

I work with mostly females, two of whom are out on maternity leave (yes, I was bitter about this when I thought about how nice it must be not to have to come back to work right away). My coworkers and I are reasonably close. We know a bit about each others' families, our quirks, and our goals in life. They know I've been married for almost 3 years, and one of them asked me while at lunch the other day if I had given any thought to having kids. Another joked about my two coworkers being out and laughed that I was \"next\" because pregnancy is \"contagious.\" My first reaction was to be angry. Angry that these people could speak so casually about something that had (unknown to them) crushed me twice this year. Angry that they thought I was taking too long or something. But then I remembered that these are people who I normally really like. And no one is trying to be mean. How can they be sensitive to what they don't know?\n\nSo I sat there and took a deep breath. I made it my goal not to sound pissy or judged. I just quietly told them. I said, \"well to tell you the truth we've been trying since March. I've actually been pregnant twice but haven't made it past 6 weeks. We think we've got this issue figured out and we're going to keep trying, but I probably won't say anything for awhile if I do actually get pregnant. Just because it's been an emotional roller coaster. But yes, we'd love kids someday soon.\" They were all struck by my honesty. The two that made the comments apologized for seeming insensitive, but I told them it didn't bug me, and I meant it. From there, lunch went on as usual.\n\nI wanted to post about this because it made a difference for me and helped me be a lot less bitter about my situation when people would bring up kids. It was a gutsy move but I'm glad I made it. Not that telling people about a loss is for everyone's style, but I think it helped me to realize that just because someone makes you feel bad doesn't mean they meant it. And some people have NO issues having kids and they HONESTLY don't realize how they come across. TTCAL is tied to a lot of emotions, but I'm not going to let it make me assume the worst of people. I don't think my coworkers think any less of me because I told them. I'd like to think it made us all wiser.\n\nTL;DR Told my coworkers about my MC instead of secretly hating them for asking about kids.

I posted a similar post to TTC30 and just wanted to become a part of a supportive and necessary community for those that have endured similar things as myself. I have been a reader on here since my loss and am in awe with the support you offer one another and how incredibly strong you all are.\n\nI have fortunately had the opportunity to carry a baby earlier this year. Unfortunately at 9 weeks we found out that it had a rare disorder (likely Turners Syndrome) with a serious heart defect and that the pregnancy wasn't viable. This was my first pregnancy and a fluke that we even conceived. At the time we weren't actively trying for children and we made a choice one night to not use a condom and I was so fortunate to have timed it perfectly and it stuck. At week 11 we found out she had died, and I proceeded with a D and C as it was a missed miscarriage at 12 weeks. \nMy D and C was in June and I had my first real AF August 1st. (That day my partner also proposed so I guess it was not only a disappointing day but also a pretty good one). \n\nI am 29 nearing 30, a type one diabetic, negative blood type and have been informed I may be a carrier for sickle cell disease (but then on second and third opinions was told probably not).\n\nMainly I am here to offer support to others that have had devastating pregnancies, or devastation just in the process of trying to conceive. Today marks my second AF post miscarriage and I really thought it had stuck. I was 7 days late, or so I thought, we had been actively trying this cycle and today I realized that I am likely on a 35 day cycle and will have to just keep that in mind for the next round. \n\nIt has been a disappointing few months for me and as much as my first pregnancy was not planned it was not unwanted. Now that we have had the chance to be parents both my partner and I are desperate to try and conceive again. \n\nThank you for reading (my novel) and I hate to be a part of the club but after reading how supportive and incredible you all are towards each other over the past 3 months, I couldn't be more grateful to know there are others that get it and care. Thank you for all your kind words to one another they have helped me through what I never expected to be a part of my story and I have found comfort in knowing there are really strangers out there who understand and support one another. I am disappointed that we have to exist as a community but am so grateful that you are now my people and to know my people do exist and you have a safe haven here.

It just feels frustrating. Everything I read about miscarriage says there is no reason to wait to try except that it makes it more difficult to date a pregnancy.\n\nDoes anyone have any advice?

We were thrilled and so excited, but I couldn't help feeling anxious. About a week later (at 7 weeks) I experienced bleeding and was admitted to the early pregnancy unit on August 12th where they found no evidence of pregnancy. It was pretty heart breaking.\n\nAfter the hospital my husband and I decided we wanted to start trying right away and so I'm struggling a small bit with worry. I'm worried we won't get pregnant for a long time, and if we do I'm terrified of suffering another loss. I'm also worrying about the toll this could have on my anxiety (worry about worry!!) and was hoping this sub could provide some answers and guidance, as well as meeting some of you ladies who have been through this before and sharing our experiences. \n\nI had a bad experience on TFAB recently, and it showcased how I'm not as prepared/ready for TTC as I thought I was. I ended up being a crying mess over something trivial in the grand scheme of things, so I think emotionally I'm still a little all over the place. I'm taking a break from that sub as a result, and found this sub in my searching for a new place to talk about TTC. :)\n\nI don't think I've ovulated since my miscarriage and today I am absolutely crippled with pain in my lower abdomen (not as painful as when I was miscarrying). So I wanted to ask if this is to be expected on my first period after my miscarriage? Or to maybe hear some of your experiences? (Google seems to throw up results of women on forums experiencing more intense cramps first cycle after so I'm guessing I'm not alone). \n\nAnyways, that was rather long winded!

I ended up having a D&amp;E at the end of July after two rounds of misoprostol failed to do the job. \n\nMy period returned last month, about which I was SUPER relieved. I was worrying and worrying that it would take at least three months to start up again, and the inexorable passing of each day was freaking my biological clock the fuck out. My kids were supposed to be less than three years apart!!!! What if they're more than FOUR years apart? LIFE WILL BE RUINED FOREVER. \n\nHowever, AF made her appearance near the end of August, and according to my period-tracking app, I should ovulate around tomorrow or so. OPKs to date have been negative, and my CM seems awfully sticky, though. \n\nWe started trying on the first day of my \"fertile window\", and I've been using PreSeed to help the spermies get to where they need to be. I hadn't realized that PS is pretty much only useful for people who have shitty CM, but once I figured that out from some PS AMA, I was pretty glad I had decided to use it this week! \n\nI can't tell if my cycle is just kind of wacky post-MC and ovulation is just going to be a bit late, or if it's completely wacky and I'm not destined to ovulate any time soon. Ugh. What a pain in the butt this all is - especially factoring in a husband with so-so libido and trying to BD around the unschedule of our toddler. \n\nNo questions, really - I just felt like sharing all of this with people who would understand and wouldn't mind knowing about my cervical mucus (it's crazy how my sisters don't want to know all about it!) and ovulation cycles and how much sex I'm having (we've managed four successful times in the past five days).

I cant go anywhere in my city without every single god damn woman I see having a baby or being pregnant, and through no fault of their own I feel like I hate them. I am so jealous I have to start over, Im so jealous that as a person who REALLY wanted their baby I don't get to have mine, yet people who don't want them pop them out like no ones business. Its not fair, and it pisses me off. To be completely honest I am getting better, I think this D&amp;C today is really a stepping point to know that I actually can move on and try again soon, but right now I dislike all pregnant women, is this just my only child mentality where I want what I want and I'm mad when others have what I don't? Or am I not alone...I'm mean I'm cool with either really, I know it will go away, but screw today, for real. Sorry about the rant, but its hard to talk about this stuff with people who don't get it........\n\nEDIT: Thank you ALL so VERY VERY much for responding, its really does mean a lot to know that I am not completely alone, whether in my thoughts or situation.

I couldn't bring myself to introduce until we were actually trying again but now that we are I'm sure I'll be more active.\n\nA little about me. I'm 29 and was diagnosed with PCOS when I was 17 and the doctor at the time told me that I would no be able to get pregnant without fertility treatment. No doctor that I have had after him agrees with that statement. I had 28 day cycles which made them all hopeful; one said maybe one day I might need clomid but we'll cross that bridge when we get there.\n\nWell, DH and I decided to start trying after we got back after a big vacation. So I took my last pill at the end of June and CD1 was July 1 and then the tracking began. I love data, so temps, OPK and saliva microscope were all acquired. I had major symptoms during my TWW, but because it was the first off BCPs I had no idea if they meant anything. Then I got my \"period\" with a 27 day cycle. It was light and lasted for about 5 days with spotting.\n\nWell, on what I thought was CD9 I woke up to get ready for work and knew that something wasn't right. There was one spot of rust colored blood on my underwear. I got ready for work, threw on a liner and grabbed a cheapie pregnancy test and a cup to pee into and brought it to work with me. I figured I can take the test get a negative and then tell my body to get it's shit together.I only did a two hour hold, but I hadn't had anything to drink that morning yet. I dipped that test and it was blazing positive immediately. \n\nI got a doctors appointment for the next day, and when I got home from work I told DH. He said he was not surprised and that I had been glowing all week. The happy was short lived because when I went for my appointment my uterus was empty and my HCG level was too low for 5 weeks that I should have been. \n\nWe took August off on the doctors recommendation and we are now back to trying. I'm on CD11 and we're giving it our best shot this month. I'm hopeful but not optimistic. My brain goes to all the things that could be if it happens this cycle but I'm trying to be realistic that this will probably take time.", "stickied": false, "subreddit": "ttcafterloss", "subreddit_id": "t5_34scd", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Intro - Back to trying (TW-mentions of loss)", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/ttcafterloss/comments/52kq02/intro_back_to_trying_twmentions_of_loss/"}, {"author": "puglife3011", "author_created_utc": 1345769447, "author_flair_css_class": "", "author_flair_text": "April and July 2015 MC", "author_fullname": "t2_8rnvb", "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1473780414, "domain": "self.ttcafterloss", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/ttcafterloss/comments/52l1mv/how_do_you_get_past_thinking_its_not_going_to/", "gilded": 0, "id": "52l1mv", "is_self": true, "link_flair_css_class": "trigger", "link_flair_text": "Trigger", "locked": false, "media_embed": {}, "num_comments": 8, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/ttcafterloss/comments/52l1mv/how_do_you_get_past_thinking_its_not_going_to/", "retrieved_on": 1476415557, "score": 15, "secure_media_embed": {}, "selftext": "Lurker and first time poster.\n\nI've had two miscarriages this year, one at the end of April and one beginning of July, both right around 5-6 weeks. We are in our mid 30's and are pretty healthy. \n\nWith the first, I miscarried the day after a positive test so it all happened very quickly. With the second I had some light bleeding and got in for an ultrasound the next day, saw what would have been our baby on the ultrasound, and miscarried the next day. \n\nMy doctor has said that they generally do not do any special testing until 3 miscarriages. She said it was possible, although uncommon, that I may have antiphospholipid syndrome and could do a blood test for that. First result, even if positive, is not always accurate, so you need to do the second test 12 weeks later. Treatment for this is apparently aspirin during the pregnancy. I have not done this testing yet. \n\nI was told that with my next positive test they will start treating me with progesterone (apparently controversial because it doesn't prove to make a difference, but doesn't do anything bad) and will do hcg levels more regularly to ensure they are going up.\n\nWe decided to keep trying and are hoping for a positive test soon. My knowledge that this is common, and that some people have many before having a successful pregnancy, is keeping me relatively sane so far. However, while I'd love to proceed with the thought that this next time it will work, I can't shake the feeling that it's not going to. If happens again and nothing comes of testing, how many times do we keep trying before we can't take the physical and emotional part of it any longer? \n\nAny words of encouragement for a positive outlook out there?", "stickied": false, "subreddit": "ttcafterloss", "subreddit_id": "t5_34scd", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "How do you get past thinking it's not going to Happen?

I just had my HSG done. It was with a new RE since mine retired. I liked him pretty well and will probably move over to him permanently. The procedure hurt like a mother effing bitch. I was not at all scared because I'd read it was quick and like a severe cramp. NO. It felt like I was getting 3 IUDs inserted. I said \"shit\" like 10 times. He said when he first inserted the catheter and blew up the balloon that it fell out - THEN asked me if I'd only had the two miscarriages....I *think* implying I was loose for never giving birth...LOL. So he said he blew it up really big and was sorry, and doing that did make it hurt more. \n\nI truly, honestly felt that everything was going to be all clear with this HSG. I never thought I'd have a blockage or anything else wrong and this would be the end of the road as far as procedures go. We had a plan to NTNP for three months. Nope. HSG revealed an \"intrauterine mass\" or \"polyp\" - he used both words. He said I need surgery to remove it, especially with having two miscarriages and that a pregnancy could attach on or near it and it could suck the blood supply from it. THEN, he showed me that near the end of one tube, where they want the dye to spill out, it didn't spill out as much as he'd like. I could clearly see the dye go everywhere on the left tube, but on the right, it kind of pooled in one area. He asked if I had pain, and I said no. He said there may be adhesions or scarring or something there and it might be something to look at with laparoscopy, but he wasn't sure. He said my tubes looked perfect though. I asked if I should not have sex and try - he said to go ahead and there's no reason not to. So yeah, I'm comfortable just chancing that and hoping a pregnancy doesn't attach to the mass that's sitting in my uterus - NO WORRIES. Ugh. \n\nGuys - what the fuck now? Calling all polyp removal AND laparoscopy recipients - what can I expect and how long until we can TTC? I'd love to read any stories, experiences, and general info you may have. If you've written about it before and just want to comment \"check my post history\" I'd be happy to do that. I feel slightly relieved that there's something happening that could explain my losses, but am also devastated that there is something that now requires possibly two surgeries. I've never had surgery. I feel sad and scared. I'm so grateful for this community in times like this. I seriously don't know what I'd do without you guys.
