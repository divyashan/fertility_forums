They are testing the baby after the surgery; also ran a carrier screening for me, and are testing my blood for a range of issues.

We\u2019d waited years because I struggled with massive ovarian cysts. My first cyst was 11.5 cm. I had it removed laparoscopically 6 months after we got married, along with half my ovary. 7-8 months later the familiar pain came back, and it culminated in the removal of another, larger cyst on our second wedding anniversary during a more involved, longer surgery. Life continued, and family plans got delayed. Through it I remained anxious, wondering if I\u2019d get a cyst on my remaining ovary, if I\u2019d feel let down by my body again, and if I was playing a game of chicken with time.\n\nFast forward to this December. We\u2019d decided to try. And 10 days after I ovulated I saw the faintest of pink lines. Barely there. So pale, but so life changing.\n\nWe moved forward with excitement. Slowly sharing our secret. Seeing parents get tears in their eyes with the news and friends celebrate our joy. Our first ultrasound was perfect. I was nearly 9 weeks, our baby was perfect, and it\u2019s heart so strong.\n\nSo we kept planning- the nursery in our new, under construction house, how we\u2019d introduce our dogs to the baby, and the time they\u2019d have with their new cousin, because we\u2019d also found out my sister was expecting too. Just 19 days behind me.\n\nI entered this week rounding out my first trimester. My nausea was mostly gone and my energy was returning. I was starting to look forward to the second trimester bliss everyone talked about. Then, I spotted. The tiniest bit. It wasn\u2019t bright, heavy, or painful. And it stopped. It was so minor I decided to tell my doctor at our ultrasound 4 days later.\n\n24 hours later I spotted again. A little heavier, a light cramp, and a small bit of bright red. I called my doctor assuming they\u2019d tell me to monitor, but instead they sent me to the ER. \n\nAt the ER they assured me many, many women are just fine. They took blood and urine. We waited amongst the flu stricken patients, the teenager with what sounded like pneumonia, but was clearly taking every opportunity to smoke weed outside, and the woman with the kind of long, curly nails you see on cheap reality shows. It felt surreal.\n\nOur ultrasound tech warned me my HCG had come back low. Between her face and my husband\u2019s I knew, and we were sent to wait for a doctor to give us official news.\n\n9 weeks 3 days. I\u2019d miscarries roughly 3.5 weeks before.  My doctor was fortunately on call in labor and delivery, and came down to give us options. She had to do a pelvic exam, but in the ER they\u2019d put me in a room without stirrups, so I had to use a plastic bedpan to raise my hips. Everyone kept apologizing.\n\nDespite being past 9 PM, my doctor offered to call in an OR team for a D&amp;C, as I\u2019d chosen to move forward quickly. At 10 PM I was wheeled in, and woken up 30 minutes later to painful cramps, quickly helped by pain meds. \n\nBecause it was so late, we were the only two in the outpatient surgery ward. It brought back memories of my first surgery, when I was the last patient to go home. I hated it.\n\nMy nurse was amazing. She gave me ice chips when we realized the anesthesia mask had cut the underside of my tongue badly. She wiped the blood off my shoulder from the mouth injury. And when the pain meds made me nauseous, she rubbed peppermint oil into my back, massaging it in to relax my lower back.\n\nWe got home after midnight, still numb to the previous 7.5 hours. I ate a bit, but my mouth hurt so much I barely could.  At 3 AM I fell asleep while crying. \n\nMy husband and I spent the last few days holding each other, crying, cracking jokes to ease the hurt. We got our report and found out I bled excessively during my procedure- over 700ml. It was controlled with medicine and uterine massage, but the massage left bruises on my abdomen.\n\nI\u2019m recovering, but I\u2019m sad, numb, and angry all at once. Grieving what isn\u2019t to be for us now, numb to the full reality of it, and angry that the whole process seems to feel like punishment. The ill equipped emergency room pelvic exam, the mouth injury that\u2019s limited me to liquid and soft foods for three days, and the fatigue and bruises from the blood loss and ensuing interventions.  My doctor confirmed miscarriage after an ultrasound with heartbeat at nearly 9 weeks is uncommon statistically, and so is missed miscarriage. I know somebody has to be in the unlucky group- I just wished after my other surgeries we\u2019d catch a break. \n\nI know it\u2019ll get better. We\u2019ve been very open about our experience and I\u2019ve received messages of love from literally dozens of friends and family familiar with our pain. Still, it\u2019s new and raw. \n\nWe now move forward knowing we want to try again. Now we will balance that decision with current virus risks and additional testing to see if we can find any problems.", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "ttcafterloss", "subreddit_id": "t5_34scd", "subreddit_subscribers": 6983, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "After multiple ovarian surgeries I thought things were finally normal for me- until my MMC this week", "total_awards_received": 0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/ttcafterloss/comments/fie90v/after_multiple_ovarian_surgeries_i_thought_things/"}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "AutoModerator", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_6l4z3", "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_premium": true, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1584169690, "domain": "self.ttcafterloss", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/ttcafterloss/comments/fiel7j/ttcafterloss_daily_discussion_thread_1_march_14/", "gildings": {}, "id": "fiel7j", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 14, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/ttcafterloss/comments/fiel7j/ttcafterloss_daily_discussion_thread_1_march_14/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1584169692, "score": 1, "selftext": "**How are you doing today?

My hubby is my best friend and the greatest support I could dream of. We are not British but we are lucky to be surrounded by my brother and amazing friends that have shown themselves to be like family by taking care of us and making sure we are not alone and that we are ok.\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\nWe\u2019re almost certain we are losing our baby...\n\nOn Wednesday I went for my regular 34w midwife appointment; as my bump was (again) measuring small, she referred me to a growth scan the following day. It\u2019s relevant to say that here in the UK you don\u2019t get any scans after 20w unless something needs checking.\n\nI asked hubby to join me for this one and we were concerned but thinking maybe I didn\u2019t have much amniotic fluid or maybe baby needed to come a bit earlier. During the scan the ultrasound technician told us that the growth was alright, baby was alright, but then they saw a big black spot in his brain, occupying almost a quarter of it... I looked at hubby and we kinda knew... they called in another senior technician and they took the images to show the OB. They didn\u2019t tell us anything besides that is seemed to be a large pool of fluid and asked us to come back later that day for a second scan with the OB.\n\nWith the OB, she showed us that baby was measuring quite small actually, the little legs only 31w, the tummy around 30w... she also showed us that there were two pools of fluid in baby\u2019s brain, one on each side, measuring 18mm and 21mm. We were explained that it\u2019s normal to have spinal fluid in our brain, but the normal is under 9mm. Anything between 11mm and 13mm is considered severe. Our baby has much more than that. The five possible diagnosis we were given are one worse than the other, with the best one being an infection I might have passed. Even if that is the case, more than a quarter of our little one\u2019s brain never developed.\n\nWhere we stand: We have been referred to a specialist hospital in London. On Monday they are going to do more scans and probably an MRI. A diagnosis is not confirmed but the hopes of this being nothing are almost none. Almost likely, the OB said, this is one of those genetic abnormalities not tested during the 12w tests. The 20w scan also didn\u2019t show anything...\n\nWe know that even with a diagnosis, our little one\u2019s chances of not suffering are very small. Who knows if he will have developmental or learning difficulties, how severe, of even if he\u2019s going to make it the first day, the first hour... We don\u2019t want him to suffer, we know what it\u2019s best if that is the scenario we are looking at. But meanwhile we are in this horrible limbo, where my baby keeps kicking as if nothing was happening and we are battling between being broken and trying to keep a cold head to make rational decisions.\n\nWe are shocked, we are heartbroken. I have had such an easy pregnancy, only with a compact bump as I kept telling people! But then again, hubby and I were both small and healthy babies! Today was going to be our co-ed baby shower... Nothing prepared us for this...\n\nI\u2019m just looking for a bit of support and advice...

The first and third were quick, CPs, the second was lost at 6+2, although I found out at 8w. They've all hurt.\n\nI have short LPs. With the last two pregnancies my period has started before I got a positive HPT. I can't think that's not related at least in part. How could an embryo grow with reduced lining? And how many possible pregnancies have I lost through early shedding? \n\nAnyway, I'm considering asking my Dr for a progesterone rx. After the second loss, when I brought up short LPs she said (I'm paraphrasing) \"that's not a thing, but I'll prescribe you progesterone if you want\".

I'm going to contact support groups today but I could really use some input from someone else who has been through this. \n\n\nHistory: D&amp;C when I was 15 (2001). Failed attempt to treat MMC by medical management at around 12 weeks followed by haemorraging and emergency D&amp;C (Summer 2019). Diagnosis of incompetent cervix, 5cm dilated at 19+0, 2 weeks ago, followed by emergency stitch. Almost two weeks hospital bed rest but heavy bleeding and clots started on Thursday. Went into labour Saturday and delivered our beautiful baby son at 22.56, 20+4. He spent a few precious minutes with us before passing away.\n\n\nI am 34 and in the UK, my local hospital is specialist in preterm prevention. \n\n\nAny help any guidance please I am so desperate.\n\n\n1. We are going ahead with a full postmortem (autopsy). We owe him answers. We spent most of Sunday with our boy taking as many photos as we could, handprints and footprints and I held and snuggled with him. We saw him again yesterday for 50 minutes and we have the option maybe to see him again today but I don't know if I should? Today may be our last chance before the PM goes ahead, which may take 2-3 weeks. They have promised we can see him again before the funeral but I don't know if that is going to be enough.\n\n\n2. How long will the bleeding last for? When will I get my period back and can I ovulate before does anyone know? They gave me a drug to stop my milk coming in could that affect it? I am desperate to start trying again. Anything else I can do to improve our chances it took 3months ish to conceive our boy last time.\n\n\n3. They said in the hospital it would be 6 weeks before my check up but we read the discharge letter and it says 12 weeks. I can't wait that long to start trying again what the hell do we do my midwife didn't know.\n\n\n4. I know they will probably have to put in a preventative stitch in if we are able to conceive but does anyone know if having had a late miscarriage is more likely to cause another early miscarriage? Critically they don't know if the IC that caused this was caused by an infection (I had small amounts of infection markers in my blood but asymptomatic. I am now on antibiotics) or the two D&amp;C that I've had.\n\n\n\nI will ask these questions and more to official providers but I am not currently getting in front of the right people. I am desperate to put this right for my boy, my Thomas John William. Is there anyone out there who can help with any of the above?\n\n\nThank you so much in advance.", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "ttcafterloss", "subreddit_id": "t5_34scd", "subreddit_subscribers": 6992, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Please help me.

My husband and I had been trying to get pregnant for a little over 4 months. To our surprise and delight, we conceived on what we thought was an \u201coff\u201d cycle with bad timing. I found out I was pregnant on Valentine\u2019s Day. After one month of being elated, we went to what was supposed to be our first prenatal appointment and 8 week ultrasound yesterday. Though this is my first pregnancy and I am new to ultrasounds, I knew from seeing many 7-8 week scans that what was showing on the screen wasn\u2019t normal. A gestational sac and nothing within. The tech was unable to find the fetal pole or heartbeat. After speaking with my doctor about how this is likely not a viable pregnancy I am sent to the lab to check hcg, progesterone, and TSH. After discussing medical management to start the process of miscarrying, I know that there is no chance of this pregnancy progressing.\n\nI am angry and sad that after months of trying, we finally get a positive pregnancy test only to discover that it basically never developed. I am devastated to see my husband cry. He was so excited about this pregnancy. I am shocked that this almost exact scenario happened to a close friend who was in my wedding party just 6 weeks ago. I am feeling incredibly isolated during an already isolating time. My heart aches because another close friend is pregnant and our due dates would have been within a week of each other. I am so happy for her (she too experienced a loss 6 months ago) but heartbroken that I will not be alongside her with my own pregnancy. Weirdly, I had a gut feeling that something wasn\u2019t right with this pregnancy, and that we would go to our first appointment and see nothing on the ultrasound. I kept telling myself that I was only feeling anxious due to having two close friends go through recent losses. I hate that my intuition was right. \n\nAs much as I hate that my friend who recently miscarried had to go through that, I feel that I will be leaning heavily on her because she truly gets what it feels like, as do each of you. As I brace myself for the wave of intense emotional and physical pain I am about to experience, I am thankful to have this community who truly understands.

Why must we keep experiencing devastating losses and \"bad luck\" while people around us get pregnant accidentally? As irrational as it is, I find myself angry at everyone who has children. Why them and not us? Despite growing up Catholic, we aren't religious people. Especially now. I don't want to believe that there's a God who would take my three babies away. It's just such an eye opening experience to realize that the world doesn't work the way that I thought it did.

My first two caused scar tissue (and now we're realizing they also probably damaged my cervix). I've had a hysteroscopy in the past to remove the scarring so we're waiting on my period to schedule an HSG to see if that will be necessary again. And then I'll have to meet with MFM to see if we're candidates for a cerclage. After researching I'd rather do the transabdominal cerclage, but I don't know if anyone in my area does them.

I had an early loss on Valentine\u2019s Day, i took two tests and got my blood tested, my HCG was 7. \n\nShe started out by confirming what had happened \u201cso you got a positive pregnancy test then started bleeding shortly after?\u201d Then said that I must have had a false positive and she wouldn\u2019t count this as a pregnancy/miscarriage and i shouldn\u2019t either because \u201cno one wants to be in that category\u201d she said that there\u2019s a hormone that circulates in your body that turns the test positive but you\u2019re not pregnant, she said that an egg just looks at a sperm and this hormone circulates because we want to be pregnant so badly. Since my blood test was 7 it doesn\u2019t \u201ccount\u201d (she said this multiple times). She said 0-5 is negative, 5-25 is inconclusive and 25+ is positive. She told me to not stress because then i wouldn\u2019t get pregnant because, you know, cortisol. She said 1 in 4 pregnancies end in miscarriage and since people test sooo early it\u2019s probably more like 1 in 2 but most of those people get false positives as well. She said that i should wait a week after my missed period to test so this doesn\u2019t happen again.\n\nI was crying really hard at this point but just trying to get through the conversation.\n\nShe went on to say that even IF it was a super super super early loss, then at least we know that everything is working right and that I\u2019ll get pregnant. She told me that if other doctors or anyone asks me if I\u2019ve ever had a pregnancy, i should say no or say 0 because i was never pregnant. She said that documented pregnancies don\u2019t happen until 6-8 weeks and that\u2019s a \u201creal miscarriage\u201d. \n\nI mustered up some words and said \u201cso what are our next steps\u201d she said i should wait until 12-14 months then the first thing would be to get my husbands sperm tested then after that i would get an ultrasound, then a really expensive test where they \u201cshove dye through my tubes\u201d. I said \u201cwe don\u2019t care about the money we just want a child\u201d she said well then that wouldn\u2019t apply to you. \n\nI now, can\u2019t stop crying and I\u2019m questioning everything. Have i been moping around this whole time thinking that I had a miscarriage when I really just wanted to be pregnant so bad that my body faked the HCG?

I\u2019ve been followed by the same fertility doc/reproductive endocrinologist since 2015. I\u2019ve had a really rough time each pregnancy with hyperemesis and thyroid issues. I\u2019m currently 13 weeks and still struggling physically and mentally. On lots of heavy duty anti-nausea meds. \n\nI\u2019ve been a bit disappointed with my fertility OB previously, as I have to stay on top of my test results and ask lots of questions. I always felt like she didn\u2019t review my file. This pregnancy, I had some bad TSH results and ended up in emerg. When I didn\u2019t hear from her clinic about any of it, I was fed up. It\u2019s really hard to get an appointment as well. She\u2019s nice enough but I find where it\u2019s a fertility clinic, now that I\u2019m pregnant, my issues aren\u2019t top of mind. Instead my GP referred me to another OB who I met today. He was patient, compassionate and is having me back next week for another scan just so I can alleviate my extreme anxiety around the threshold of my last loss. I finally heard the heartbeat for the first time today. He said he was cool with whatever I decided on who would follow me - he told me not to worry about it. \n\nMy regular OB at the fertility clinic has made it very clear that I cannot be followed by both OBs. She appeared offended that I was assuming I would get referred to a non-fertility regular OB after 20 weeks, which seems to be a common thing where I live. She said she wants to follow me and my file is complicated, so why would I ever consider switching now? \n\nAll of this seems really obvious: I should go with the new guy. But I feel this impending fear that I\u2019m making a mistake because my current OB has followed me for 5 years. I\u2019m also worried that if I switch now, I will get booted out of the referrals for the fertility clinic. If I miscarry again, I\u2019m looking at a 1 year waitlist minimum to get back in if I get the boot. So I don\u2019t know - I\u2019m in Canada where it\u2019s kinda \u201cbeggars can\u2019t be choosers\u201d situation. I\u2019ve never switched docs for anything before because it\u2019s seen as so difficult. \n\nI\u2019m also way, way, way too empathetic.
