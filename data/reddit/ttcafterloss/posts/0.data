I'm not naive anymore - I knew before that baby loss happened but I never thought it could happen to me. Now I know that when I get pregnant, I could miscarry, have a stillbirth, or the baby could have a birth defect again (oh god, that would kill me). Statistics showing that I'm more likely to have a healthy baby don't mean shit to me - once you're in the 2% of people who have a baby with a serious birth defect, the 98% doesn't matter anymore. You only see the 2%. \n\nI get really sad every month when I don't get pregnant but I'm starting to wonder if I'll be sad when I do, too. I WANT MY INNOCENCE BACK.

I lost my pregnancy at the heartbeat appointment (blighted ovum), but it took 16 months of infertility for us just to get pregnant at all.  So not only was the loss hard, but it was compounded by all the months of infertility hell and now the upcoming who-knows-how-long it'll take us to get pregnant again.\n\nThat said, I would like to get a tattoo of a rose (June's birth month - my due date was June 12th) to honor the loss of that child and the loss of all the hope that came with it.  My thought is to do it in the middle of my right side, maybe a little set back to avoid any future stomach stretching.  That also allows me to add to it as necessary and work my way down onto my hip, etc, in case there are future losses or future actual children.  And since this is a very personal thing for me, it's placed in a spot where people won't constantly ask about it.\n\nSo on to the advice... I happened to find a perfect tattoo artist who does great things with florals, and while I was bawling and a bit drunk on new years eve, I decided to submit a request via her website.  Well, she got back to me and said she was so sorry for my loss and understood the pain personally.  So not only is she awesome at florals, but she knows the pain of miscarriage!  Here's the thing though - originally I figured I would wait to get this tattoo until I got pregnant again and had a baby because I didn't want to deal with stretch marks.  But then in my crying fit on NYE, I realized it could be months, years, etc to get pregnant again!  Why am I waiting!  And hell, if I get a few stretch marks where the tattoo is, who cares!  It's only for me anyway!\n\nAnyway, I wanted to get your thoughts on it.  Am I crazy to go ahead and do it now, specifically in the location where I plan to get it?  Right side abdomen, above my hip, below my ribcage, kind of in that soft area in between.  And set back enough that it's not encroaching on my stomach area.\n\nThanks for your advice!\n\nEdit: [Pic 1](http://media-cache-ec0.pinimg.com/736x/85/9f/6d/859f6dc159f01f4d3f009ddca10627e0.jpg) and [Pic 2](http://media-cache-ec0.pinimg.com/736x/e7/fd/74/e7fd741ba88c011b835a38f2b55d3c97.jpg) of my inspiration/style\n\nEdit 2: Thanks everyone for your overwhelming support :)  Appointment is booked!

In any case, the people we told are people we are supposed to be close with.\n\n\nFriday night, DH and I saw our close couple friends for the first time since the MC.  I had told the wife about my loss through text, and we texted about it briefly, and then made plans to get together.  When we got there, they did not mention the MC at all.  They did not ask how we are doing with the loss, if I am okay physically or emotionally, did not say sorry or offer condolences.  All night, just NOTHING. \n\n\nSunday night was basically a repeat of that.  We went to DH's mom and stepdad's house for dinner.  Again, it was the first time seeing them since DH told them what happened over the phone.  I was expecting they would certainly want to talk about it; they were so excited to become grandparents so it is a loss for them too.  My MIL even had two miscarriages of her own back in the day, so I thought she might have some words of comfort.  I was shocked that they did not mention it at all.  It was like I had never been pregnant.  Absolutely no mention of the horrible ordeal we had just been through, no condolences, no questions, nothing.\n\n\nHave you experienced this?  I feel so hurt that they will not even talk about it.  It feels like our loss didn't mean anything to them, and is not even worth mentioning.  DH thinks they were all just trying to be polite and not bring up an unpleasant topic that might upset me.  But that just is BS to me.

Previously it's always been related to motion sickness or travel. \n\nI tried to think about what could be causing it, did I have a brain tumor, was I going to have to shoot myself? (mostly kidding). \n\nFinally I remembered that I had been taking a new Calcium/Magnesium/Vit D supplement. So I started looking at my Cal/Mag/Vit D intake and between the supplement and my prenatal I was getting (RDA) 50% Calcium, 63% Magnesium, and 375% Vit D. Well, that's 1500 IU Vit D3, that's a safe amount (many now regard the USDA's recommendation of 400IU Vit D to be too low), and I've certainly taken that much before. \n\nSo I googled 'Cal/Mag/Vit D causes headaches'. Well. It turns out that the body uses magnesium to process Vit D, and if you're not taking enough magnesium for the amount of Vit D you're taking, you might get symptoms of mag deficiency. . . which are headaches, nausea, insomnia, etc, etc. Bingo. \n\nSo I took some powdered Mag Citrate I had, skipped the Cal/mag/D supplement and prenatal yesterday and today, and my symptoms are 80% gone. The last Cal/mag/D supplement I was taking had a good bit more Magnesium. \n\nMoral of the story: none.

I recognize some names here and thought this might be a nice group to join. Sadly I just had a TFMR and D&amp;C last week at 22 weeks due to chromosomal/development issues discovered in our baby girl. I'm still in shock and trying to process it all. My husband and I have been trying for over 3 years now and this was going to be our miracle baby after being told in July that we likely would never have a child due to low ovarian reserve. A month later I was pregnant and we thought god had finally smiled on our family. Turns out not so much...\n\nWe don't have the funds for any type of IVF or other treatments and after spending the few thousand dollars we did have on testing we now know we are pretty much at the cross your fingers and pray stage of TTC. Still, we believe. I know that in a 12 month period I was naturally pregnant twice, even if it didn't work out. We believe in our heart that somewhere lurking in those ovaries there is still one good egg just waiting to come out. Right now I can't imagine pulling out the OPKs and starting this whole nightmare up again but I know we will. The doctors tell us we are clear to start up again after 1 cycle so whoo hoo I guess. \n\nOther than that I'm just looking for support as my world just seems shattered. We had almost finished the nursery a week before we found out about our baby. I had been so nervous but I decided at 20 weeks the best way to embrace my pregnancy would be to really go all out and get the room ready. It seems like a tragic joke now. I've hid everything I can in the closet but the changing table mocks me. Do I sell it? Do I keep it? Do I take an axe to it and light it on fire? I don't know.

It was early, so the physical symptoms were not too bad. But even with it being an unplanned pregnancy, we were devastated. After that, we started actively trying to get pregnant and were finally successful again in September 2014. We'd had an amazing summer (lots of travel, honeymoon in Greece...GREECE!) so the pregnancy seemed meant to be.\n\nMy body thought otherwise and it turned out to be an ectopic pregnancy. Just after I hit the 5 week mark, I started spotting. After having a miscarriage before, I was a wreck about it. But, my hcg continued to double so the nurse practitioner I saw wanted to wait a week to do an ultrasound because it was too early. Three days later, I was in the ER with a ruptured fallopian tube. Bonus--during surgery, the doctor found that I have endometriosis.\n\nSo now here we are, trying again. We're seeing an RE now and our tests have turned out pretty normal. My left tube is open and I do ovulate every month. I have a genetic abnormality that can cause clotting issues and possibly repeated early miscarriage, so I've been taking baby aspirin. The spot of good news I have to share this month is that Friday we found out that I am ovulating from both ovaries, so maybe that's a good sign?\n\nAnyway, about us outside of our glum reproductive prospects-my husband works in the oilfields in North Dakota, so we spend a bit of time apart while he works. I'm not working at the moment, but earned my Master's in education last May. (We'd been preparing to move when the ectopic happened, hence why I wasn't working.) We have a 5 month old puppy who keeps us busy and entertained. We're both nerds and huge readers. Anyway, I'll shut up (English major, so I get wordy). I'm so thankful for all the subs I've found around here because everyone I've met basically rocks. Wish us luck for this month!

I was walking out to my car and lifted the back to put my bags in the vehicle when one of the workers comes up to me and starts talking. I had seen him around before since we shop there frequently and he has a mental disability. He's always been friendly and talks to a lot of the customers. He said he's going to help me load up my groceries and take my cart for me when I'm done. Ok awesome. As he's helping me we are talking and he hands me the bag of bread and says \"Your kids must really love bread\" (I had a loaf, bagels and hamburger buns so lots of bread. lol) and I responded \"Uh I don't have any kids\" and he replies \"I know you will one day\". I wanted to give him the biggest hug. It made me happy. Something simple as that made my day from a complete stranger. \n\nSo has anyone had someone say something that made your day?
