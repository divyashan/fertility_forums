We have 2 daughters who are now 11 and 8. After we got married we decided to start trying for a sibling for our girls.\n\nIn September of last year I found out I was pregnant after trying for nearly 6 months. During the time that I would've conceived, I was under immense stress from a job that I hated, fighting with my husband, and contemplating going back to school. After a particularly stressful day, I decided to take a test and it came back positive. I wasn't as excited as I hoped I would be because of the stress from work and the fights with my husband. He didn't seem too excited either.\n\nAbout a week later my oldest daughter fell off her bike and suffered a concussion. I was so worried about her but I couldn't show her so I just held it in. She was very confused and for a couple of hours she had loss of short term memory. I kept trying to soothe her but I think just my presence and the fact that I'm an EMT helped make her feel ok (she kept saying \"I'm so glad you work for the ambulance!\" haha). At one point I even contemplated telling her she was going to be a big sister again just to give her something else to think about, other than being in the ER. I didn't end up letting her in on the secret, and I'm thankful for that.\n\nA week after my daughter's accident, I miscarried. It didn't hit me right away. I think because I'm an EMT I knew what was happening and didn't let myself feel the emotions that come with it. Eventually though, I broke. I was at work, trying to act like everything was normal, and then I just couldn't be there anymore. I broke down in the middle of the day and told my boss. She sent me home and I just let myself feel. It was the worst pain I had ever felt.\n\nEventually things got back to normal for me. I ended up starting school 2 weeks later. It helped me get through my grief and I'm still going strong, but I don't know if I'll be ok tomorrow.

I don\u2019t know how much detail intros usually go into, I\u2019ve just begun researching today... Thursday was supposed to be my anatomy scan, for my second pregnancy but my third child. (The first I have raised and have custody of but is not biological or legally my own child.) I put on my cutest new maternity clothes, a little make up, felt cute. My husband recently started a new job working nights and forgot about the appointment. He told me to wake him to go, and I tried once, but he looked at me bewildered and didn\u2019t truly wake up, so I let him sleep. My stepmom was meeting me there, and we were not planning on finding out the gender, so I thought everything would be fine. He\u2019s not missing much, I\u2019d just bring him pictures. I felt a little dread in that decision.. what if something was wrong? No, I\u2019m paranoid. That was definitely a little kick just then. \n\n\n   I walk in and explain why my husband didn\u2019t come with me. My stepmom jokes about telling him there was a twin they missed in the first ultrasound. I check in, we\u2019re called back. Asked if we plan to find out the gender and stepmom says she would lovvve to but knows we aren\u2019t going to. I was nervous about that because she was begging from the day she found out I was pregnant to know the sex, that she could keep a secret and be the only one. She completely accepted our decision when it became relevant. Feeling more at ease. Things begin and I can\u2019t really tell what I\u2019m looking at. That\u2019s a head but how is baby laying? Weird. I\u2019m no expert, she says that\u2019s an arm bone. Neat. \n\n\n   She asks me to go leave a urine sample and come back for a vaginal ultrasound. I didn\u2019t feel like I had to pee but I do my best and I can make out the rib cage and spine. I see the head again and notice it measures at 16w3d. Weird, I was 20w1d. Also hadn\u2019t gained weight yet this pregnancy, so maybe the baby was just measuring small? Oh well. I won\u2019t panic until the doctor tells me to. Shortly after this she checks the ribs out again and I didn\u2019t even notice... then she leans over and tells me she isn\u2019t finding a heartbeat. Everything feels blank? My stepmom is asking questions. Ultrasound tech repeats that she doesn\u2019t see a heartbeat and is going to ask the doctor how she wants to proceed. My stepmom panics and cries instantly. Her tears bring my tears. She calls my husband and tells him to come up there immediately. \n\n\n   We move to a room and it takes a long time and people keep apologizing and I just feel bad for making them uncomfortable. The doctor says my baby\u2019s heart stopped just a couple days after my last appointment at 16w. I realize I\u2019ve been carrying a dead fetus for nearly a month... she tells me my options are to go home and wait for my body to react or I can go to the hospital and get things started. I don\u2019t have to decide right away. I definitely want to get this over with. My job involves a lot of standing around and being left with my thoughts and I was supposed to work the next day. I couldn\u2019t face that... I couldn\u2019t face staying at home with my thoughts either. I needed to deal with this immediately. \n\n\n   We get the car situation figured out since we had three vehicles and I was no longer allowed to be alone, so I was left with my grandmother while they fixed the cars and packed my bag. We head to the hospital and it becomes real. I cry again. Two people at registration ask me what I\u2019m there for and no one really told me... I didn\u2019t have words. My stepmom handled the first person. The second one I was alone for and just said my baby\u2019s heart stopped and broke down. I get into my room and see the baby things everywhere and panic and cry again. I don\u2019t sit on the bed until they ask me to put on the gown. Liquid diet from here on out. Then so much more waiting. My children visit and my oldest is having a really hard time accepting that she can\u2019t be in the room for the birth like we originally talked about. I told her it\u2019s not going to be the way she thinks but all she keeps saying as she sobs is that she wants to be able to say goodbye to the baby. I was broken for her.. she eventually calms down and asks me when we will try again. Another awkward conversation. They stay for a while and distract me from all the awfulness happening. \n\n\n   Loads of cytotech all night. No progress. My dr described it as enough cytotech to \u201cbirth a horse.\u201d She starts pitocin. It takes most of the day to make progress. My water finally breaks. I wake up to another cervical check and cytotech dose but she determines my baby is right there and asks if I would like to push. I push twice and out comes my little 3oz baby boy. My husband, aunt, stepmom, and I are all crying. I hold my baby once, for only a minute and hand him back once she tells me he was a boy. They take him and I sob some more. Then my aunt and stepmom leave me alone with my husband. I spent a lot of time staring at the ceiling. Trying not to cry anymore because I still hate crying in front of people. Even when it\u2019s appropriate. It takes 4 hours and they call a dr to come help remove the placenta because I was unable to push it out. They wake my husband for me so he can hold my hand because my vagina was sore from all the cytotech and the speculum is NEVER comfortable. It was over and even more real. The next morning I cried. And cried. And cried. Finally getting to go home after getting my memory box with his tiny footprints and my aftercare instructions and note for returning to work. Showered and spent the rest of the day trying to feel normal again. Sleep in my own bed was wonderful. \n\n\n   And here I am now. It\u2019s been a few days and I\u2019m becoming more curious about what happened. I know grieving will take a while and some moments I\u2019ll be okay and not others. I know that pathology may not bring me answers and I\u2019m prepared for that as well. I know it was nothing I did and probably/hopefully not going to happen again. Now I just want to know how to proceed. I\u2019m calling to set up my two week follow up tomorrow and trying to make a list of questions for my doctor. I know I want to try again and yet I know it\u2019s going to be the longest wait and there\u2019s going to be so much worry... this lost pregnancy was almost flying by. Anyways, that\u2019s my story. I hope I made this inappropriately, I was hoping typing it out would make the last few days feel real. I still have my baby\u2019s ultrasound photos on display in my room. I don\u2019t want to forget, but I don\u2019t want to let it define me either.", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "ttcafterloss", "subreddit_id": "t5_34scd", "subreddit_subscribers": 5269, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Hi.

This community was recommended to me a few weeks ago while waiting to confirm if my pregnancy was moving forward or not. As it turns out, it\u2019s the latter. \n\nThis was my first pregnancy and this has all been a lot but very new to me and I\u2019m wondering what to expect and for some input. \n\nOn April 9, I went in for an early ultrasound at what should have been 6+6 (confirmed by O confirmation). We measured 5+6 with no heartbeat. HCG dropped a bit after this (12000 to 9000 in 3 days), but doctor wanted to recheck. I went back in after the weekend and had jumped back up to I believe 24000. We redid the ultrasound 2 more days later (8 days after the first) and measured again at 5+6. HCG went again up but this time only to 28000. We repeated the ultrasound once more 6 days later, and still measured 5+6. At this appointment (last Wednesday I believe it was), the doctor finally stated the pregnancy wasn\u2019t viable. I\u2019d had this belief internalized since that first ultrasound but had small hope with the HCG rises that the ultrasound was just not seeing the baby somehow, but here we are. \n\nIt\u2019s now been nearly 4 weeks since that first ultrasound, and nearly 5 weeks since baby stopped growing.

I started TTC in February and got pregnant in March. Unfortunately that pregnancy was short lived and I miscarried at 6w in April. My OB gave me the go ahead to try as soon as I wanted and said it was unnecessary to wait until I'd gotten a period. \n\nI had a lovely LH surge on April 19-20 and thought my body was returning to normal and treating the MC like a period, which is what my OB said would happen. Except I'm now 9 days past my LH peak without a single progesterone symptom in sight. Normally they start almost immediately after ovulation, never this late, so I'm pretty certain I didn't ovulate. \n\nI'm now on cycle #3, a totally wasted cycle out of the very few I have left before I'm supposed to get fertility help. I feel like there's a countdown until cycle #6, like I'm halfway to infertility. Next cycle I'll be 2/3 of the way there. \n\nI feel so much disappointment in my body. First I could've carry my baby, and now I'm not recovering like my OB said I should. Right now my body just feels hormonally dead. Not a twinge of breast soreness or swelling, not a hint of a cramp or even a bit of bloating. My LH is the lowest I've seen it in any cycle (PreMom says .1 - .15, when my usual lows are .2 and higher). I just feel absolutely nothing when usually I can feel various somethings all throughout my cycle.\n\nI don't feel like I can talk to anyone about how I feel right now. My soon-to-be husband just tells me it's normal after a miscarriage. I know it is, but now by body has failed again and we're one month closer to an infertility diagnosis. I look much younger so he just doesn't get that my likelihood of conceiving is lower and risk of miscarriage higher. \n\nWe are getting married in 3 days and I keep thinking about how different everything would be if I were still pregnant. We were planning to tell his parents even though it would have only been 10 weeks because they're here from out of the country and it would have been the only way to tell them in person. Now I just feel sad and can't even tell anyone why I'm acting so moody.\n\nI feel so disappointed right now. My OB thought I would conceive again quickly and easily and that my body would return to normal immediately, and instead here I am poking my breasts for the hundredth time to see if they're sore yet and realizing that they are but only because of the other 99 times I've jabbed them. \n\nCan anybody help me get out of this funk?", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "ttcafterloss", "subreddit_id": "t5_34scd", "subreddit_subscribers": 5271, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Really struggling today", "total_awards_received": 0, "updated_utc": 1557552676, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/ttcafterloss/comments/blgvnr/really_struggling_today/"}, {"all_awardings": [], "author": "charusingh28", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_3q1vjwrc", "author_patreon_flair": false, "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1557207033, "domain": "vrindafertility.com", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/ttcafterloss/comments/blmuup/vrinda_fertility_best_test_tube_baby_centre_in/", "gildings": {}, "id": "blmuup", "is_crosspostable": false, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": false, "is_self": false, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 0, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/ttcafterloss/comments/blmuup/vrinda_fertility_best_test_tube_baby_centre_in/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1557207034, "score": 1, "selftext": "", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "ttcafterloss", "subreddit_id": "t5_34scd", "subreddit_subscribers": 5280, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "default", "title": "Vrinda Fertility- best test tube baby centre in Noida | Best Infertility treatment in noida | IVF Centre in Noida | Test tube baby centre in noida", "total_awards_received": 0, "updated_utc": 1557558257, "url": "http://vrindafertility.com/laparoscopic.html"}, {"all_awardings": [], "author": "charusingh28", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_3q1vjwrc", "author_patreon_flair": false, "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1557210112, "domain": "vrindafertility.com", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/ttcafterloss/comments/bln99c/best_fertility_centre_in_noida_best_ivf_centre_in/", "gildings": {}, "id": "bln99c", "is_crosspostable": false, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": false, "is_self": false, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 0, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/ttcafterloss/comments/bln99c/best_fertility_centre_in_noida_best_ivf_centre_in/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1557210113, "score": 1, "selftext": "", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "ttcafterloss", "subreddit_id": "t5_34scd", "subreddit_subscribers": 5280, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "default", "title": "Best Fertility Centre in Noida | Best IVF Centre in Noida", "total_awards_received": 0, "updated_utc": 1557558757, "url": "http://vrindafertility.com/view.html"}, {"all_awardings": [], "author": "AutoModerator", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_6l4z3", "author_patreon_flair": false, "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1557213014, "domain": "self.ttcafterloss", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/ttcafterloss/comments/blnm9g/ttcafterloss_daily_discussion_thread_1_may_07_2019/", "gildings": {}, "id": "blnm9g", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 25, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/ttcafterloss/comments/blnm9g/ttcafterloss_daily_discussion_thread_1_may_07_2019/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1557213015, "score": 1, "selftext": "**How are you doing today?

Last week I had my first MC at 5w5d. This was my first time pregnant after 3 or 4 cycles of trying\n\nLast Monday I went to EPU for spotting, suspecting it was innocent but the ultrasound suggested my bean stopped growing a week prior. My bloodtest came back with HCG levels of 900 and progesterone of 2.8 which confirmed this wouldn\u2019t be a viable pregnancy. \nMy body miscarriaged relatively quickly and i\u2019m ready to start trying again next week. Exciting but scary at the same time. \n\nI\u2019m obviously super anxious about things. I want to understand if this was bad luck or if there\u2019s something wrong that needs fixing. I don\u2019t want to rely only on \u2018time to tell\u2019, i want to start investigating if my fertility meets the fundamental basic requirements. I\u2019m looking for answers to questions as: Are my progesterone levels normal? Do i suffer from hypothyroidism? Do i suffer from blood clotting? Is my uterus lining in optimal condition? etc. \n\nI live in the UK and am at the mercy of NHS who wont do a thing till i\u2019ve miscarriaged 3x. I\u2019m happy to go private but i simply don\u2019t know where i should start.\n\nWhat type of specialist should i see, what testing should i prioritise and when? I will have to pay out of pocket. Any advise would be super useful. I\u2019m just looking to empower myself with information, with the hope it will put my anxiety at ease -or- help me identify solutions as soon as possible.

I went to see the doctor and my HCG levels were much lower than they should be (At approximately 7 weeks).  \n\nI went in for a follow up and the doctors advised that they suspected the pregnancy to be ectopic.  I went into surgery and had my right Fallopian tube removed and a twin pregnancy removed from my abdomen.  \n\nTo make everything more complicated in the middle of all this we PCS\u2019d to a new state.

I had a bad feeling about the pregnancy from the beginning - my tests were very light for a few days, but eventually picked up. I didn't get a 3+ weeks on the CB digital until I was 6 weeks pregnant. I went into for my first scan at 7+2 on Wednesday, and my fears were confirmed - little bean was measuring 5+5 with a HR of 90. It was a monitored cycle with my OB, so we're 100% sure of my dates.\n\nI go back on Tuesday for another scan. My OB was trying to keep us a bit positive and said that a bean in the right place with a heartbeat isn't the worst news - but I can't see it ending happily. My pregnancy symptoms are all gone (after vomiting and nausea up to 6 weeks) and I suspect the heartbeat will be gone on Tuesday. \n\nI want to think about my options before I see him on Tuesday so I'm not blindsided. My priority is to get pregnant again ASAP, so if there's no heartbeat, I would like to nudge the miscarriage along rather than wait it out. I have a slight preference for a D&amp;C over pills to avoid the trauma of seeing everything, but I ultimately want to do what will get me fertile again quickest. I've also had a c section and we were worried about scarring before I got pregnant, so I wonder if a D&amp;C might also give my doctor a chance to have a look at that too?\n\nAny advice or tips would be much appreciated.

I delivered my son (stillborn) at 23 weeks on March 5th. It\u2019s been a really shitty past 6 or so months.\n\nMy pregnancy was fine up until 13 weeks, at that point I thought I was having a MC but it was a subchorionic hematoma. They said baby was fine and that it wasn\u2019t a big deal and that women make it to term all the time with them. We monitored but I kept bleeding. At 20 weeks my water officially broke, completely. I was on strict bedrest, doing everything I possibly could but one early morning I went into labor and delivered my son, Silas. They think he passed earlier the day before or something. His weight was great and we would\u2019ve tried to save him/intervene but he was already gone. I always knew that this was a possibility\u2026but it all happened so fast. From my first contraction to giving birth it was a 2 hour span. I ended up taking an ambulance and that ambulance got hit on the way to the hospital. Then I ended up having to have a D&amp;C after giving birth cause my placenta wouldn\u2019t come out. It was a horrible experience. I\u2019ve started going to individual counseling to try to work through some of my feelings and PTSD. It\u2019s hard.\n\nStarting in September we are going to try again and I\u2019m scared shitless. They say it was a fluke and shouldn\u2019t happen again but it doesn\u2019t matter\u2026.my anxiety will go through the roof. I\u2019m also scared to give birth because of the pain.

I have a toddler (3 in June). We were lucky to conceive him our first try with no complications during pregnancy.  \n\nI wanted the next baby close after but due to my husband's work we held off. Last summer we decided to try and got pregnant on the second cycle and were really excited.  I always had some caution about the possibility of miscarrying. I started to worry that my symptoms were pretty much non existent compared to my first.  But everyone says \"every pregnancy is different\". At just under 9 weeks I went to the ultrasound by myself (no family around and my toddler was with a sitter). Right away I could tell something was wrong and when she asked about my dates and wanted transvaginal I started crying because I knew. Sure enough baby had stopped growing at 6.5 weeks.  We had a trip out of country planned ten days later so we opted for the d&amp;c.  I  had to wait on call for 3 days to get in (fasting each time). Once I got in we went to the hospital.  During the prep I was holding it together and they told me I'd be recovering on the mom's and babies ward.  I stopped being able to listen and said \"you mean with the new babies\" and she said \"yes I know it's not ideal\" and I just broke down crying and asked they try to find something different.  Luckily they did find another room.  I only spoke to obgyn as I was on surgery table.  Luckily the procedure went well.  \n\nMy husband was not very supportive and the next day wanted to leave me with my toddler so he could go to the gym. He never brought up the miscarriages again and wasn't very empathic.  On our trip I was so irritated, angry and anxious.  We ended up getting pregnant a few weeks after d&amp;c and that's when I started realizing I wasn't over the miscarriage and all the ways it was affecting me.  I spent more time crying about the loss than being excited for the pregnancy.  \n\nI was having lots of symptoms but I was still nervous despite lots of hcg blood tests that looked great (stopped them around six weeks). I had an ultrasound booked at 9 weeks but a couple weeks before I started freaking out and having severe anxiety.  My midwife told me to stay positive and at 8 weeks I asked her thoughts on me going to ucbaby to just check for a heart beat.  She suggested I just wait but I booked an appointment a few hours later. I took my toddler in tow and sure enough the lady couldn't find a heartbeat but couldn't tell me the size or any other info.  Now I was really panicking and called my midwife.  I had no childcare and they don't allow kids in ultrasounds so I had to wait four long days to go for an ultrasound.  Once again I immediately knew it wasn't good and they let me know baby stopped growing around six weeks.  \n\nI was floored.  I opted for misoprostal this time. My experience with it was okay.  Went back for a check and needed a second dose (which was much easier than the first). It was about 3 weeks from the first ultrasound to getting the all clear.  \n\nAs I was going through this my ten year old dog that I'd had since a puppy became sick.  I was driving her to appointments and it kept worsening.  Eventually found out that we had to say goodbye.  I was crushed,  this was the final straw and I felt so broken.  I couldn't believe everything life was throwing at me.  I was crying constantly and my poor toddler was clearly being affected by everything.  It was hard to balance caring for him and taking time to heal.  The one good thing was that my husband and family felt grief and loss for her with me.  I finally didn't feel so alone.  Neighbors sent cards and flowers,  people messaged and shared memories.  It was an acknowledged loss unlike the miscarriages.  I could share on social media and people could understand.  I began counseling,  journaling,  talking to others,  exercising. Anything I could think might help I tried. \n\nEventually I started feeling a little better and even having good days.  Then six weeks after losing my pup my grandfather had an embolism.  He was in the ICU for two weeks before losing him.  It was so challenging being there for family.  I feel like I haven't even fully grieved him because I've just had it with grief and need some denial.  \n\nIt's been a few months since the last miscarriage and we've decided to try again.  This time we just randomly had unprotected sex but plan to get more serious next cycle if I don't get pregnant.  \n\nI feel like the joy and excitement of pregnancy has been robbed from me. I'm coming out of the shadows but I'm forever a changed person.  Definitely a more empathic person.", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": true, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "ttcafterloss", "subreddit_id": "t5_34scd", "subreddit_subscribers": 5339, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "spoiler", "title": "Intro - New to this Sub", "total_awards_received": 0, "updated_utc": 1557690700, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/ttcafterloss/comments/bng7nl/intro_new_to_this_sub/"}, {"all_awardings": [], "author": "mamaljk", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_3ak1k42n", "author_patreon_flair": false, "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1557605268, "domain": "self.ttcafterloss", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/ttcafterloss/comments/bngdyb/mmc_and_cp_trying_to_stay_positive/", "gildings": {}, "id": "bngdyb", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 4, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/ttcafterloss/comments/bngdyb/mmc_and_cp_trying_to_stay_positive/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1557605431, "score": 3, "selftext": "Hey guys,\n\nI had a MMC at 10 weeks in January and had a CP at 5 weeks in April. \nI had some blood tests done and the doctor said all my levels were great except that my B12 was higher than normal because I take multivitamins. \n\nDoes anyone know if B12 can affect fertility because I tried to ask the doctor and she didn\u2019t really explain it very well. \nAll of my hormones were \u201cperfect\u201d apparently so I don\u2019t know what is happening inside me.\n\nI am TTC again this week but I don\u2019t think I ovulated because it is straight after the AF after my CP and I feel nothing!  :( \n\nAny reassurance and happy stories welcome!!!!\n\nMy first pregnancy was straight forward and my son is almost 2.

I didn't get periods very often but I think they are starting to regulate after eat healthier. Due to my BMI, I don't like how I look and I am doing something about that. I have one child and I have never had a miscarriage before. I did not know how much it could rob someone of their femininity. We have the green light from the doc to keep trying. I do want to try again but I am lacking in the feeling in the mood department. I want my partner to feel loved and I know being physical is important to us both.

He said my gestational sac has some scalloping and isn't the shape he'd like to see, but my cervix is closed and the clots weren't tissue. So now it's expected I'll keep bleeding this week and mildly cramping with a probable full miscarriage. We recheck bloodwork on Friday and will get results then. Doctor said we'll either have a heartbeat or the pregnancy will have been naturally aborted. My heart is aching, husband is scared and our hope is minimal. That was not the way I thought my first Momma-to-be Mother's Day would go. Now we are in miscarriage limbo and I can't think straight.", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "ttcafterloss", "subreddit_id": "t5_34scd", "subreddit_subscribers": 5371, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "What the hell kind of Mother's Day was that?", "total_awards_received": 0, "updated_utc": 1557925288, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/ttcafterloss/comments/bo98fa/what_the_hell_kind_of_mothers_day_was_that/"}, {"all_awardings": [], "author": "Beebeedeebee", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_3i95js79", "author_patreon_flair": false, "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1557797839, "domain": "self.ttcafterloss", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/ttcafterloss/comments/boce2v/update_to_my_limbo_post_miscarriage_confirmed/", "gildings": {}, "id": "boce2v", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_css_class": "trigger", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_template_id": "7465d7b8-7120-11e4-9568-12313d14791d", "link_flair_text": "Trigger - enter type here", "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 29, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/ttcafterloss/comments/boce2v/update_to_my_limbo_post_miscarriage_confirmed/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1557797867, "score": 19, "selftext": "Hi everyone - I posted last week about delayed growth (10 days behind at 7+1) and a low HR.
