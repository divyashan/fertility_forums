The BFP came up right away (!), then I waited for the little little hourglass to stop flashing and tell me how many weeks post ovulation I should be (which should be 2-3 post ovulation, putting me at 4-5 weeks to date the pregnancy). But the test popped up with 1-2...I know the test is just estimating and that the HCG levels in women can vary a lot, but now my brain keeps thinking that something is wrong, my HCG levels are too low and I'm going to lose this pregnancy too.\n\nIn theory I think I ovulated around CD 20, but the OPKs were unclear so I don't really know for sure. But if I ovulated a little later than I thought maybe that could account for slightly lower HCG levels than what the test expects for 4-5 weeks pregnant. The first pregnancy I had pretty high levels, so high they thought I had multiples when in fact the pregnancy just failed and my body kept trying by pushing more hormones out. uuggghhh\n\nI'll go to get officially tested at my doctor's office on Monday, but it's just a qualitative urine test. I don't think they'll do blood work until 6 weeks or further, though I think my OB/GYN will be doing early/more frequent ultra sounds because of the previous MC. \n\nI'm not happy or excited about this positive test, I'm just scared that my body is failing me again and there is absolutely nothing I can do about it.

I was going to wait until we had our results back so at least we'd know what the hell happened.\n\nA little history of us: We are both 25 years old (I'm turning 26 in 2-3 months). I have PCOS and long cycles (unmedicated they varied between 35 and 98 days, medicated 30-40 days) We had been trying since Jan '14 and succeded on our 2nd clomid cycle last November. \n\nWe found out last Thursday in our 12 week US that the baby had not developed more than 6-7 weeks. We had experienced a missed miscarriage. It's crushing to know that for all those happy weeks we believed we were expecting, we planned and looked at names, we already know what changing table to buy, I was thinking of how to announce it to my friends this weekend. \n\nThe doctors expect a partial-molar pregnancy but we won't know for sure until we get the test results back. If it turns out to be a PMP we won't be able to try for quite a while. If it turns out to be just a regular miscarriage (athough what the hell is regular about this...) we may start trying again soon. \n\nHow soon I don't know as I've heard so many versions. We were told in the regular cases we should wait for at least 2-3 cycles. With my endless cycles I don't even know how long that is... We want to start trying as soon as we can. We have talked a lot about this experience, our ttc and future plans. And the answer is always that we want to start TTC again. We feel like we need to. This limbo is killing me, and it's not even been a week...\n\nI wanted to ask those of you who have long and irregular cycles how long it took for your period to come back? And did it get extra irregular? I know this has been asked like a thousand times but I always here answers like it will be 2-4 weeks delayed. What if my periods are ALWAYS 2-4 weeks delayed? Do they come at my body's \"normal time\" or are they delayed even further? What about ovulation? I sometimes ovulate and sometimes not. Can I expect not to for the first cycles?

It wouldn't be stickied like the daily post we already have (I can only sticky one at a time) but it could be posted by AutoModerator daily. \n\nMaybe it could be a good in-between place for those who just got their BFP and don't feel comfortable moving on yet.

Since I am becoming a bit active on this subreddit, I thought I would post an intro.  I say it's a premature intro, because we are not actively trying at the moment, as our last loss was pretty recent.  But this is the community where I feel most at ease, so I how you don't mind me crashing.  \n\nWarning, descriptors of my losses below.\n\nI have a gorgeous 2 year old son who was supposed to be a twin.  We had a threatened miscarriage at 6 weeks, when they discovered I was pregnant with twins.  This was my first pregnancy, so we quite foolishly told ourselves double or nothing.  Looking back, I now know exactly when I miscarried my baby - in the OB's office of all places, at 7 weeks.  But it was a total shock for us to only see one baby at the 8-week ultrasound.  We asked the tech about the other baby, and she said, what baby?  We had a vanishing twin.  Hard to grieve a loss while we had another child to celebrate.  And people say some unfortunate things in an attempt to be helpful.  The pregnancy was rocky throughout, but by some miracle I carried him to term.\n\nWe were not trying for our second pregnancy.  It had taken us 14 months with our first and one episode of indiscretion with our second!  But we had been discussing a second child, and when we found out, we were happy, despite the financial piece.  This was the opportunity for our more joyful pregnancy.  A minor medical issue related to the pregnancy had me in the ER at 5.5 weeks with an extremely reassuring bedside ultrasound.  Then my son and husband contacted a virus, hand-foot-and-mouth disease, when I was 6 weeks along.  We tried to limit my exposure - but that was the beginning of the end, though we did not know if at the time.\n\nAt our midwife appointment at nine weeks, everything looked \"great \", though we were unable to hear the heartbeat on the Doppler (your baby is hiding being your pubic bone, don't worry at all).  HCG level was 15,000+ - perfect.  The following evening, my son and I headed across the country for the holidays - my husband was to join us in a little over a day.  The one day we were apart was the day I found out I had a missed miscarriage - the baby arrested at 6.5 weeks, probably because of the HFMD.  A week later, the day after Christmas, I miscarried.  10 days later, I passed the rest.  Because I was in a different state, I couldn't even get OB follow-up until after the whole ordeal was over.\n\nSo for now - we are back to waiting.  The experience had made my husband shy of trying again.  I would like to start trying again late summer.  So we shall see what happens.  And in the meantime, I will grieve for my little summer baby and try to remain hopeful.", "stickied": false, "subreddit": "ttcafterloss", "subreddit_id": "t5_34scd", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Premature intro.", "url": "http://www.reddit.com/r/ttcafterloss/comments/2tyl8n/premature_intro/"}, {"author": "ttc-secret", "author_created_utc": 1417619116, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_text": null, "author_fullname": "t2_jrvv0", "created_utc": 1422456623, "domain": "self.ttcafterloss", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/ttcafterloss/comments/2tyss3/good_morning_and_hello/", "gilded": 0, "id": "2tyss3", "is_self": true, "link_flair_css_class": "intro", "link_flair_text": "Intro", "media_embed": {}, "num_comments": 4, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/ttcafterloss/comments/2tyss3/good_morning_and_hello/", "retrieved_on": 1440940407, "score": 7, "secure_media_embed": {}, "selftext": "Morning! \n\nI've been lurking for a bit and have been waiting until I finally saw AF to introduce myself - and here we are! \n\nA little background - I was 7weeks when I miscarried and it happened on Christmas day (Merry Christmas to us.)

Especially those of anyone in the medical field!\n\nI have mentioned here that I have an appointment coming up to get a memorial tattoo for my pregnancy that I lost. It's linework only, no color, and will be on my right side.\n\nOk, so looking at timing now, my appointment is right around ovulation for this coming cycle. I had hoped that it would be more in the time between AF and ovulation, but looks like that's not the case. In fact it will either be right on ovulation or 2-3 days after.\nI've done a lot of reading online, and obviously I'm going to a reputable artist with zero risk of HIV or Hepatitis or other ridiculous things that don't occur anymore in licensed and very clean tattoo shops. This isn't some dude's garage.\n\nThe only remote thing I can find that would be a risk is that they don't have any studies done on the effect of ink on a fetus, so no promises that it's 100% safe. Well that said, if I'm getting this done before the egg even implants, could that really be a concern? I've read anecdotal stuff online and lots of people have gotten tattoos while TTC or even before knowing they were pregnant, even during pregnancy, and they all seem fine. And this isn't anywhere near the actual presence of a fetus - just an egg. But is the egg even more vulnerable and I should just reschedule?\n\nThe concern is that her schedule is packed tight. She's scheduling 6-8 weeks out at the earliest, and so I run the risk yet again of running into poor scheduling. She's highly in demand so I am worried about rescheduling too many times and putting her off.\n\nI'm so torn. On one hand, I may not get pregnant anyway. Heck, 16 months to get pregnant the first time, and my first medicated post-MC was a bust. So I'll be annoyed if I put this off and am not pregnant either. But on the other hand, if I got pregnant, would I always be worried about it having impacted something?\n\nHonest opinions totally welcome.\n\nEdit: I definitely will ask my RE about this specific instance.  The one time a couple months ago I asked my nurse about it, she basically brushed it off and said not to do it because of the risk of contracting HIV or hepatitis.  Which is bonkers if you go anywhere reputable and clean as opposed to some dude's garage.  So I didn't take that advice as the actual opinion of my RE.  I just wrote my RE about this specific timing and appointment and will report back what she says.  I was just trying to get general consensus thoughts since as much research as I am doing on it, can't find a reason why this would be risky to the actual fertilized egg, especially before implantation.\n\nEdit 2: Response from the RE is frustrating!  \n&gt;I reviewed your concerns with Dr. M and she verified that she does NOT recommend getting a tattoo during treatment. She said the concern is disease transmission and if a disease is contracted or a flare-up occurs during pregnancy, there would be negative outcomes for both you and the baby. Her recommendation is to wait until after you've delivered before getting a tattoo.\n\nI'm sorry but it's very narrow-minded to be concerned about diseases.

First of all, every one of you couldn't think of a good reason why it could cause actual harm to a floating egg, so thanks for that.  I do recognize that it is stressful on the body overall though, and there is always a risk of infection, so proper care is extra, extra important.\n\nMy RE responded (via the nurse), and said this:\n\n&gt;I reviewed your concerns with Dr. M and she verified that she does NOT recommend getting a tattoo during treatment. She said the concern is disease transmission and if a disease is contracted or a flare-up occurs during pregnancy, there would be negative outcomes for both you and the baby. Her recommendation is to wait until after you've delivered before getting a tattoo.\n\nSo, honestly, this reads like a legal boilerplate recommendation.  She cannot acknowledge that it's entirely safe and since it's their job to get me pregnant and deliver a healthy baby, they HAVE to tell me they don't recommend it.  I will note though that she used the words \"recommend\" and \"recommendation\" in lieu of harsher, more absolute terms.\n\nSo then I decided to ask my acupuncturist.   She *only* does infertility acupuncture, and so she definitely is completely, acutely aware of the same pregnancy goals and all the medical stuff that goes into that.  In fact, she loves my RE and my RE recommends her as an acupuncturist.  I included the RE's response to her, and explained everything.  I also told her I understood that she couldn't legally give me her professional opinion, and I was just asking her personal opinion.  Here is her response:\n\n&gt;Personally, I don\u2019t think tattoos are really risky nowadays at a clean, good shop so I wouldn\u2019t think twice about it if it were me. I know they are CYA in terms of their answer and I had a patient whose donor had to cancel in the middle of IVF at this clinic because the donor (who was stimming) got a recent piercing and they saw it! So I think that\u2019s their policy. Anyway, if it were me, I\u2019d just go for it, but I am not giving you official medical advice. I don\u2019t think there is really a risk from the ink or anything (like toxicity) in pregnancy, right? I\u2019m just not too sure. But I am certain they are kind of paranoid about the tattoo thing. Let me know what you decide. I want to see what you get too!\n\nOk, that brings us to an actual decision.\n\nI don't have one right now.  I am honestly leaning toward finishing out my progesterone and then having a natural cycle.  The reality is that we did get pregnant once on a natural cycle, so it's not like without medicine our chances are zero.  And really right now there are two conflicting goals: 1) tattoo and 2) pregnant.  If I choose in favor of the tattoo, there is a 100% chance I will succeed.  If I choose in favor of a medicated cycle, there is a 10% chance of pregnancy, probably, at best.  I've been going after this since July 2013 and only achieved one pregnancy ever.  \n\nThe reason why I am leaning against doing a medicated cycle and then going through with the tattoo is two-fold:  First, I will highly likely ovulate much later naturally (I was usually irregular but centered around CD 17-20ish), and that will help further put us in the clear from this tattoo appointment as well as push us out of the travel red zone I have lined up for the following cycle.  I don't believe that the tattoo process would harm anything if done just after ovulation, but I would probably sleep better if it was before it.  Second, I do want to respect my RE and don't want to blatantly go against what she said.  If this is what they say, then I shouldn't be an asshole patient who completely ignores their terms.\n\nAll that said, I will talk with my husband about this extensively this weekend, because he should get a say in all this.  We're a team and collectively we're trying to get pregnant, so he gets a vote too.\n\nI will keep you all posted!", "stickied": false, "subreddit": "ttcafterloss", "subreddit_id": "t5_34scd", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Update: The great tattoo debacle", "url": "http://www.reddit.com/r/ttcafterloss/comments/2u3507/update_the_great_tattoo_debacle/"}, {"author": "waterfall444", "author_created_utc": 1400578818, "author_flair_css_class": "", "author_flair_text": "medical termination in Dec and IVF just failed", "author_fullname": "t2_gn455", "created_utc": 1422560696, "domain": "self.ttcafterloss", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/ttcafterloss/comments/2u44fh/a_few_of_us_are_hanging_out_in_the_chat_if_anyone/", "gilded": 0, "id": "2u44fh", "is_self": true, "media_embed": {}, "num_comments": 3, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/ttcafterloss/comments/2u44fh/a_few_of_us_are_hanging_out_in_the_chat_if_anyone/", "retrieved_on": 1440937922, "score": 3, "secure_media_embed": {}, "selftext": "http://webchat.freenode.net/?channels=%23ttcafterloss", "stickied": false, "subreddit": "ttcafterloss", "subreddit_id": "t5_34scd", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "A few of us are hanging out in the chat if anyone wants to join...", "url": "http://www.reddit.com/r/ttcafterloss/comments/2u44fh/a_few_of_us_are_hanging_out_in_the_chat_if_anyone/"}, {"author": "rainbowmoonheartache", "author_created_utc": 1391964096, "author_flair_css_class": "", "author_flair_text": "TTC#2; RPL; IVF#3/FET#1!", "author_fullname": "t2_f6zfo", "created_utc": 1422566893, "domain": "self.ttcafterloss", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/ttcafterloss/comments/2u4i5c/good_doctors_appointment/", "gilded": 0, "id": "2u4i5c", "is_self": true, "media_embed": {}, "num_comments": 9, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/ttcafterloss/comments/2u4i5c/good_doctors_appointment/", "retrieved_on": 1440937745, "score": 8, "secure_media_embed": {}, "selftext": "So, I just got back from my regular doctor.

I'm nervous about it because it's major surgery, similar to a C-section, and it'll mean I'll have to have a C-section if I ever get pregnant again. I'll start a new IVF cycle a month after the cerclage surgery.\n\nAfter having to give birth to a baby with no chance of survival, I've tried to put it out of my mind. I'm not sure this has been good for me but moving on was the only way I thought I could deal with it.

My dh and I barely talked about it when It happened. It was before we wanted kids or thought we did. I remember the excitement around everything. It seemed everyday was more exciting as we got away from the idea of \"you're just probably a little late.\" To \"maybe we should think about making a doctors appointment.\" I still remember the test Coming back positive. I thought about doing something creative to tell him but I couldn't keep it in so as soon as he got home I just blurted it out. We hugged and cried. We started planning about cars and buying a home. Then reality hit two days before the doctors appointment came. I had horrible pain and blood. This wasn't a period. I saw the doctor and they let us know what had happened. I felt stupid for being excited. I didn't want to talk about anything and shut down. I felt all that guilt from all the irrationality that comes from hormones. My dh and I had a silent car ride home and never spoke about it until tonight. \nI held that guilt especially through us currently trying. Recently. someone at work found out she is expecting and announced it proudly. I finally realized I was bitter because all I could think \"so id be almost having a baby right now you're not special.\" My dh asked me how my day at work was and I responded \"fine everyone is pregnant but me.\" This was a bit of red flag. His reaction was perfect. He threw his arms around me and said \"Not everyone is pregnant but you. It will happen. You are not to blame. We are ok.\" \nSometimes the simplest words are all you need. It took us almost 9 months to process our feelings and honestly it was ok. We had a very healing cry and talk. Now more than ever I feel ready. I just felt the sudden urge to share our story. \n\nTl;dr: had a chemical pregnancy back In July. Didn't really talk about because neither of us were ready. Had it tonight finally gonna start trying for babies again.

I feel like I'm out this cycle. I've been super depressed this cycle too. Anyone else experience this? Or have any advice or kind words? Anything ..

I'm currently living with my boyfriend of a year and a half, we both go to college so marriage isn't quite in the picture yet. We only attend community college so we have a lot of free time and flexible schedules, so we aren't worried about a child conflicting with our education too much. I conceived in November and missed my period December, but tested just after Christmas and got a BFP. Right after telling my mom I went into the ER because I was bleeding and they just said I had a UTI, prescribed me antibiotics and sent me home saying I had a healthy 7.3 week old fetus. On January 22nd, right after telling all my family and facebook friends, I was cooking and a gush of brown blood came down my legs. I called to see if I should come in because at my first midwife appointment they schedule a second ultrasound because I had this type of minor bleeding that showed up in my ultrasound. They said to come in ASAP to do a ultrasound and they told us the growing stopped at about 7.7 weeks, go figure, right after my first ultrasound. My SO and I were devastated but I took it way harder than him. I'm still struggling to get through the days. After two weeks I've gone from 400hcg to 40hcg. I *hope*I ovulated but probably not. Now we are just waiting to either test or my period. So that's where I am right now. Thank you for reading \n\nAlso this may sound dumb but I'm really into music! If any of you have any songs that helped you through your loss or reminded you, feel free to share. I want to share mine because even though I liked it before, hearing it after I had a miscarriage, I sobbed. \"Iris\" - By Goo Goo Dolls", "stickied": false, "subreddit": "ttcafterloss", "subreddit_id": "t5_34scd", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Never really introduced myself....", "url": "http://www.reddit.com/r/ttcafterloss/comments/2vf7um/never_really_introduced_myself/"}, {"author": "MackieMouse", "author_created_utc": 1345487806, "author_flair_css_class": "", "author_flair_text": "TTC #1; missing Ethan after 22wk loss; 2 ectopics", "author_fullname": "t2_8qcwd", "created_utc": 1423610401, "domain": "self.ttcafterloss", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/ttcafterloss/comments/2vh14z/this_deserves_its_own_post_today_is_redeemed/", "gilded": 0, "id": "2vh14z", "is_self": true, "media_embed": {}, "num_comments": 19, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/ttcafterloss/comments/2vh14z/this_deserves_its_own_post_today_is_redeemed/", "retrieved_on": 1440914803, "score": 13, "secure_media_embed": {}, "selftext": "So after going to the RE at 7 AM for a beta in spite of the fact that 1) I knew it would be negative and 2) I could have slept in because we had a delayed opening at school, today just seemed destined for the crapper.  \n\nAnd then, by some stroke of insanity, a parent came in for a meeting at the end of the school day and brought me this: \n\nhttp://i.imgur.com/a6MDWI3.png\n\nHoping all my fellow craft beer aficionados will appreciate that :)\n\nFor those who don't know, it's arguably the Best Beer In the World (literally, it's the #1-rated beer on BeerAdvocate) and it's almost impossible to get.  \n\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heady_Topper\n\nA *parent* managed to snag some during a ski trip and brought me a precious, precious can.  \n\nTime to get drunk and hope CD1 is tomorrow.
