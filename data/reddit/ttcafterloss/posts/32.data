We can afford to pay the bills, but I just feel like this third miscarriage has taken so much from me and I don't have anything left to give. \n\nI don't regret going to the emergency room at 5+6 for cramping and bleeding. I needed answers and the on-call OB at the practice I go to recommended I go. It was because of that visit that I knew I was pregnant with twins. When we left the ER that day, we had hope and excitement in our hearts. It is just so hard to believe how much money it cost for the amount of care I received, even with insurance.\n\nAnd though my husband has been spectacular after this loss, I got pretty angry when he said \"that's why I don't go to the doctor.\" I just can't shake the feeling that he's unhappy having to pay these bills, and to him, it is about the money, not about what we found out at the visit. I feel like he blames me for what may have been an unnecessary ER visit. Like I said earlier, I don't regret going. It felt like the right thing to do.\n\nI must have been doing a really good job distracting myself the last few days, because I was feeling okay, even good at times. But suddenly, after I opened those bills, everything feels wrong again. I can't stop thinking about the hope I felt when we saw a baby the beginnings of a heartbeat. And I can't forget the devastation of not finding anything just one week later. I want to get bad scenes out of my head, but I don't want to forget the happiness I had before things started going wrong again. I guess I have to take the bad with the good.\n\nThis loss has taken so much, and it isn't about the money. It's hope that I lost. Optimism for our future family.

I was 6 weeks pregnant and only got to enjoy that for 2 whole days. Then the bleeding started, and it didn't stop for 4,5 weeks. Only then did the doctors find out it was an ectopic and I had to have emergency surgery. \n\nA year since this roller coaster of emotions journey began. Our first year of marriage was supposed to look so different. It wasn't supposed to go like this. These things don't happen to us, they happen to other people. I was 1 in 100 women who get an ectopic pregnancy. I almost died little less than a year ago. We lost our baby. A baby that would've been over 3 months old right now.

The thing is, I'm not infertile. I clearly haven't had trouble getting pregnant but for the life of me I cannot keep my babies alive past 7 weeks in utero. So what category does that put me in? The insurance company emailed me saying I can go to these other clinics (however, not covered still so what is the point) and I went to the clinics' websites and its very heavily \"infertility and IVF\" worded. We aren't at that point. \n\nI really just thought I needed someone to do a few extra tests and work with me pre-conception and monitor me closely once I become pregnant. Background, I have had blood tests done with a previous provider for chromosomal abnormalities and all came back normal except that I was ANA+ which my OB at the time was not concerned about. More recently, post miscarriage, my new OB just tested my thyroid levels, protein c and s, hemoglobin, antithrombin III, and glucose. Other than my thyroid, which I have been on medication to treat for 13 years, it is all greek to me.\n\nI'm sorry this is so wordy. I just don't know what to do. I am considered high risk now so I am wondering if I need a perinatologist? But would they even see me before I am pregnant? Or should I just see my OB again and beg for more help? My biggest fear is that I will have to keep having miscarriages until they take action.\n\nAny insight or advice would be appreciated.

I can't believe I am doing this sharing my story loosing our daughter at 26 weeks going 27 weeks.  When my wife told me she haven't felt her kick like she normally does automatically I started saying nothing is wrong she's fine busy sleeping and growing. I know my wife worries a lot. After 24 hours still no movements we called our midwife and met at the hospital where we found out about the devastating news that our daughter is gone. In my mind I didn't know what to say or do as I watched my wife crying and saying \"not my baby\" I didn't want to cry as my job I was next to her hold her hands and let her cry on my shoulder. That was the hardest thing that ever happened loosing our first child. To fast forward this past year was difficult as I watched my wife in pain, crying and blaming herself that it is her fault. I talked to her day and night that it wasn't her fault. I still can't find away to express my grief as I didn't want her to see my cry even though I was struggling I kept my self busy going to work and come back home, taking some trips together I love to get away and just drive to clear my mind. She is doing better now but this is when reality just hit me and i am just starting to feel the loss of our daughter. All this past year I have been busy running around because you always hear men have to be strong but not in this case right now I am weak and hiding it from wife. As right now tears are rolling down my eyes crying softly like a child because I don't want her to hear me cry.  Exactly a year grief hit me. I thought I had it all figured out but these past and next few days are going to be hard. We are still young in our mid 20's we heard a lot of times when people said we are still young and our chance will come. I don't want hear that we are still young it doesn't matter wether we are in our mid 20s or 30s a loss is a loss and it is terrifying to even think to try for another child. It is hard to talk to someone and let them know how I am feeling inside. I feel like no one understands what I am going through unless you lost a child before. I noticed that I picked up my bad habit of smoking after quitting for 4 years. I realized that it is to mask and hide my grief. I look the pictures of my beautiful little princess every day and wished I could've done something to save her and to think that did she suffer during the last few minutes?  I am going to end the story hear I can't say much now. It is late and have to go to office in the morning. I am looking for advice from anyone and also if there are any father in hear that is dealing with the same. We do not hear from any men as we try to be strong but that just not true reason why I am coming out to help me with my grief.

Sorry for the length, need to get some things off my chest. \n\nI had a missed miscarriage, and medically miscarried in September. My baby had stopped developing a month before I found out, and its been difficult dealing with the fact that I felt and thought I was pregnant for a month, when I actually wasn't. It feels like such a cruel, sick deception. Anyone else experienced this? \n\nI was very depressed and anxious afterwards, but I've been doing better lately. My SO and I are finally able to try again, and I'm cautiously optimistic. The thing I've really been struggling with lately are my relationships with family members. I went through all of this alone and didn't feel any support from the people I expected it from. When I found out I was pregnant, everyone was so excited and called and messaged me. After the miscarriage, the worst thing I've ever been through, I didn't really hear much from anybody. It hurt so much. I tried opening up to my mom about what I was going through, and thought she was being supportive. But when she came to visit me (I was excited to have someone to finally unload all my thoughts onto) she spent the whole time talking about herself, and telling me all the people she had told about MY miscarriage (people I don't even know) and how they were sad for HER. I was furious and just wanted her to leave.\n\nMy aunt, who I am very close with, sent me one text message after, and that's it. My SO and I decided to get married recently and had a super small and quick ceremony one day, and I got an angry call from my aunt asking why I hadn't told her about it. I just wanted to scream at her, \"why the fuck would I call you about that when you didn't even call me after my baby died!\" Also, after we got married (we are very private people and didn't want a giant wedding or anything like that), the congratulatory messages from family started pouring in. I couldn't believe it. They were making such a giant deal about it, when I had barely heard anything from them after I miscarried. \n\nAnd yesterday I was talking to my mom about how we are TTC, and she kept saying things like \"Let's be honest, you're not going to get pregnant for a while. There's no way.\" And she kept making comments making it sound like she looks down on people who have to \"try\" to get pregnant, and how she didn't have to try at all. \n\nI honestly feel like my relationships with these people will never be the same. I feel so angry with them. At first I made excuses for them like, \"oh it's okay, people don't really know what to say\". But I'm realizing this is bullshit. They are my FAMILY. \n\nThis is the loneliest most isolating thing I have ever been through, and I feel permanently changed. Rant over! Anyone else have similar struggles with their relationships?

Allow me to introduce myself and apologies in advance for the wall of text. I'm incantationkidnapper - 28F, been married since March and with my partner for 6.5 years. In July we decided to finally start TTC!\n\nA week ago I got my first BFP ever on cycle 4. I was so excited, but also very nervous. I tested early because I was going away for a few days (combining a work trip with seeing friends) and knew there would be some events with alcohol. I diligently diverted all offers for glasses of wine or going out too late and think I managed to avoid raising too much suspicion. \n\nI tested a couple times throughout the week and didn't notice the line getting any darker but put this off to testing with internet cheapies. On Saturday I bought a clear blue digital and received a pregnant 1-2 weeks with FMU on Sunday. I saved the test so I could show DH when I got home Tuesday. On Monday afternoon the test no longer showed the results and by the evening I started to notice some brown spotting. Something in me knew this wasn't a good sign. The cramps I had been experiencing changed to become more like period cramps. \n\nTuesday I woke up and I was bleeding. I knew it was the end but I tried to convince myself it would be ok. I took another clear blue digital and it gave me the same results as before. The most squinty line came up on the internet cheapie. I had to go buy pads. I still had another day of work plus a flight to get through before I got home. \n\nI broke down on the plane. Before takeoff I texted DH that I needed him to meet me when I landed (he had dinner plans). Then I had to turn my phone off. I didn't know if he received the text. I silently cried throughout the flight, trying to distract myself by listening to music and reading the inflight magazine. I was only pregnant for a week; why does this hurt so bad? What did I do wrong? I know it isn't my fault and it is normal to grieve after a loss, but damn, why is the world so cruel?\n\nThe plane landed and I turned off airplane mode. My battery died. I still had no idea if DH was going to meet me. I got through immigration and picked up my suitcase from baggage claim. DH was there! He held me and assured me it would be ok. That these things happen. That we will have a baby one day. It isn't the end of the world and we will get through it together. We will keep trying. I am very thankful to have him. \n\nToday is slightly better. I am sad to not have my July baby but I am hopeful for the future.\n\nI know there are so many others out there that have lost more than I have. I am blown away by your determination and will to keep going. Seeing your success stories and the supporting nature of this community is wonderful and makes me believe that it is possible. Thank you all and apologies again for the long post.

My SO was so worried.\nToday around noon I had an epiphany, I need to get the fuck up and live. \nI miss being pregnant and I miss my future baby.\nI miss my SO laying his hand on my belly and saying \"I love you both so much\" \nHow is it possible to love something so much that I only knew for a week?\nMy best fiend told me \"the minute you see the positive line you become a mom\" and now I understand what she meant.\nBut I was spiralling, I need to get out of bed and live. \nI showered for the first time in three days, I cleaned the house, I did laundry and made supper. I did my normal routine and am so proud of myself.

They said it's not unheard of but that a progesterone supplement would only prolong the imbalance. They recommended I see a nutritionist so I can adjust my diet to include foods and vitamins that will signal my body to start producing progesterone. \n\nI took a night off work so I've had a long weekend so far and have gotten lots of rest and stayed in a positive mindset.

We've been together 10 years. I'm 30. This was the right time for several reasons including mat leave benefits, new job, new province, etc. Took a couple of cycles with OPKs and then, great, was pregnant. Told some close friends. I didn't tell my family - I wanted to do it in person and I'd just moved. My best friend from med school got pregnant a month before I did. We were going to do mat leave together. \n\nI'm in more of a regional centre with longer wait times for ultrasound. I didn't have my dating and viability U/S scheduled until 12w6d. At the time, I was like 'well that's probably fine, but I'd love confirmation of a single, live, intrauterine gestation'. I had decided that this pregnancy was going to be totes normal - which, now in retrospect is RIDICULOUS to ASSUME. Especially in my case, since as an MD, I provide maternity care, including to lots of women who have miscarriages, and other losses. Anyway, 10wk5d rolls around and I'm having spotting, cramping, and I've realized that I'm no longer tired. I have tons of energy. Shit. We went to the ER where I work once/week, and my colleague examined me in the exact same room where I do gyne exams. She uses the same ultrasound I use on patients. My nursing friends come to see what's up. Zero confidentiality, but everyone is super nice. She was like 'maybe you're off on your dates by 5 weeks', there's something in the uterus, maybe even with a heartbeat... My partner was optimistic, but I knew that moment. Still next day I went to get the 'real' u/s emergently, and nope, no baby. Just a weird septated fluid. ?molar pregnancy? I did serial betas, they dropped, another colleague prescribes me misoprostol, I end up back in the ER for pain and dehydration. Genetic testing reveals no molar. It took probably 3 weeks for my bHCGs to go back to zero. I took two days off work. And now I deal. \n\nI deal with so many daily triggers. Pregnant women! Delivering babies! Delivering babies at 3am when my resiliency is low! C-sections! Couples with infertility. Pregnant friends. And then so many people seemed surprised that I was pregnant on purpose. So many people asked 'was this a planned pregnancy?' Yes, I literally put in IUDs for a living (and I do a few other things!!!), but I have no idea how to control my own fertility. But also! Even if it wasn't planned its definitely not the business of randos who know me through work. \n\nThis experience has changed me. When I got my misoprostol, the pharmacist (not the technician mind you, an actual pharmacist) asked me if I still needed the diclectin. Engraged and shocked, I was like 'listen to what you're saying. Think about it. You will never, ever, take those at the same time! Be a better professional!'. (Berating people in public is not typically part of my ambience...!)\n\nWe're now trying again, its time for AF cycle 2 post MC. I'm 14dpo with no start, and no positive test, so body is a trololol. \n\nTL:DR? Trusting the medical system is hard, even when you are part of it. What we all go through is hell, and I'm sorry you've all been there. So hello. I've been silent, but I'm here too. \n\nETA: The stories on this sub are amazing. You're all super resilient and have dealt with shitty situations. You don't always get the empathy and respect you deserve, and thus the necessity of groups like this. Thank you for sharing. It normalized and legitimized my feelings for me and helped me realize that they were valid. I'm going to see my pregnant best friend from med school this week. I should have been 21weeks, she is now 25 weeks. Its hard not to be reminded of the loss (my baby!) when you have a time reference like that...", "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "ttcafterloss", "subreddit_id": "t5_34scd", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Hello!

I cut back on my meat consumption. I was eating mostly a plant-based diet. I cut back on coffee consumption. I started taking CoQ10. I took Tumeric supplements for inflammation.

We very recently lost our baby and are hoping to start trying again as soon as possible. However, I have an anxiety disorder, which was particularly bad during my first trimester in my most recent pregnancy. I took benzodiazepines for it (Valium, namely), under my OB's supervision, which I regret, as I later learned that it could have played a role in creating our son's birth defect that was eventually fatal. I know that both trying again and possibly getting pregnant again will cause even more anxiety now that we've lost a baby, but I don't want to take benzos if I can avoid it since I feel so guilty for doing so during my last pregnancy. It also doesn't help that, out of the blue, my health insurance decided to stop covering my SNRI, which they had been covering for months (it's $20/pill; I can't afford to pay out of pocket). I'm currently taking a different SNRI that I was on before and didn't/doesn't work for me. \n\nIf you have an anxiety disorder, especially panic disorder, what (if anything) did you take while TTC/pregnant after loss to help mitigate your anxiety?

My Ob said to wait to try until first period which happened end of August. I got pregnant again second cycle in October, but my progesterone was low, hcg didn't rise well and then dropped 8 days later and I'm almost done bleeding from that. I was on progesterone supplements during that time \nAnyways, Ob said to wait until my first period to try again so that they can track my hcg to 0 (&lt;5) and that way when it rises know I'm pregnant vs retained tissue. She's also doing some testing (I know a bunch of bloodworm that I go in for today, not sure what else she recommends right now). \nSo my dilema... we all know there is no higher risk if mc if you conceive before your first period. I obviously conceive pretty easily, so if I could just hang on to the damn thing I'd be ok!  So.... do I try this month and say fuck it, or wait until the testing is done and protect until next month? Mentally the second pregnancy never felt right so I'm not mourning right now (like symptoms disappeared 2d after the faint positive hpt) \nLike I said fully aware we're taking weeks here and it's not important, but since I've spent a hour debating this am..... thoughts ladies?

We were successful on the first try. How awesome and lucky! My OB had me come in 3 times to check my betas as I had a little bit of spotting right after I got my BFP and they wanted to rule out an ectopic. I also got an early ultrasound at 5w3d. Everything was looking great! The following week my morning sickness started. Everything I read said this was a good sign. In retrospect, I call bullshit. I went in for another ultrasound at 7w5d where I was told there was no heartbeat and the fetus stopped developing around 6w. Right when my morning sickness started ramping up. I decided to give it another week before taking any action, mostly I think because I didn't want to believe what they were telling me, and also to see if my body would do its thing and miscarry naturally. No such luck. I had another ultrasound a week later which showed more of the same, but helped me accept that this baby was truly gone. I chose the misoprostol route, as the thought of a surgical procedure, no matter how minor, freaked me out. That weekend I was all ready with my super absorbent pads, strong pain meds, heating pad, husband and pets for moral support and cuddles. I ended up doing two doses over two days and not more than a few clots passed. Maybe the sac passed and I missed it? Nope, my body just can't do its freaking job. A week later at yet another ultrasound they told me that the sac was still in there and I needed to schedule a D&amp;C. They gave me the option of general or local anesthesia. I chose local as they said I would be in and out faster. I made the wrong choice. [warning, a little graphic] This was the most traumatic thing I've ever experienced. I was very aware of what what happening and could hear and feel the suctioning. I'm pretty sure I was in a state of shock. If I ever find myself in this unfortunate situation again, I would definitely choose the general anesthesia.  \n\nSo here I am a week post D&amp;C. Waiting in this limbo of suck. HPT was still positive this morning, though less intense than the control line now, so that's encouraging. I'm just mad that my body can't seem to do anything right. Couldn't grow a baby, couldn't pass the miscarriage on it's own. Couldn't even pass it with the help of meds.  \n\nI should be 12 weeks pregnant this coming Friday. I should be getting ready to announce this joyful thing to friends and family. I should have been sporting a tiny bump at Christmas time. I had the cutest announcement planned. It was going to be Thanksgiving themed. I bought tiny little baby booties that look like turkeys. Dammit this sucks so hard. I just want my cycle to return so we can try again.  \n\nOn a positive note, at least I can drink to get through the holidays. Thanks for listening ladies.
