Felt a lot like ovulation pain, but worse. Went away after a few hours. (This plus fever makes me wonder if I ovulated really early?)\nAugust 12 - The nausea begins again. Ugh. I thought I was done with it. All previous pregnancy symptoms disappeared immediately after d&amp;c. (I had very intense nausea and vomiting)\nAugust 15th -  TMI. Started bleeding black blood. Super scared me. It was basically like black coffee in color and texture or whatever. Sorry to be gross. Stopped after a few hours. I wasn't in pain so I didn't see a doctor about it.\nAugust 16th - Positive pregnancy test, also I puked in the book aisle at Walmart and can never show my face there again.\n\nCould I actually be pregnant again so soon? There's no way, right? It was a very dark line on the test. \nHow long does it take after a d&amp;c for the pregnancy hormone to disappear? I'm so confused.

I\u2019ll give you a little back story. I\u2019m 23 years old and currently engaged to my soul mate. I was told in December of 2018 that there would be no way I could get pregnant on my own, I would need some assistance. We weren\u2019t ready for a baby yet anyways, so we decided to put it on the back burner for now. I decided instead to start my weight loss journey and started doing lazy keto. At my heaviest, I was 192 lbs at 5\u20193. I ended up getting down to 170. Valentine\u2019s Day of 2019, I ended up getting sick randomly and felt really weird and off. Come to find out, I was about 5 weeks pregnant. We were so excited. It was unexpected but such a blessing. I had a hard pregnancy from the start. I had a ton of bleeding the entire time. They think because of this, my son never had the change to implant correctly. We also found out a few weeks in that I had an abnormal uterus. These problems ended up causing my water to break at 21 weeks and they weren\u2019t able to stop my labor. We had my sweet angel baby on June 13th. He was perfect in every way, he just didn\u2019t have the room to grow. Fast forward to today, we are about to schedule a surgery for them to fix my septate uterus, once we complete that, they give me the green light to start trying again. Where do I even start? I have a few months to prepare and get a good game plan in place, I want to conceive as soon as possible. What worked well for you guys? I\u2019m probably gonna go back on keto because I truly think that helped me start ovulating. What can I go ahead and start doing to help myself prepare? What should I start buying to start out?

I was thinking of making a pros and cons list and then thought I'd ask other folks going through this if they'd continue or not.\n\n**Reasons to Stop TTC:**\n\n* I turn 40 in September which is when I have always said I'd be done with birthing kids.\n* I have diminished ovarian reserve (DOR) with an AMH of .22 and FSH of 14.9.\n* My eggs are the equivalent of a 43-year-old due to endometriosis (stage 4) and endometrioma in 2014. The age equivalency is is according to my fertility doctor.\n* Even if we did have a viable pregnancy my risk of chromosome disorders is high due to egg quality/age.\n* The last 2 pregnancies were at 6 weeks when they stopped growing and this last one (D&amp;C was last Monday) stopped growing at the 5-week mark.\n* I'm am not myself when I'm pregnant. I'm incredibly stressed out, forgetful, and sensitive as fuck. It is unpleasant to be me, and it is unpleasant to be around me. I try so freaking hard to not burn down bridges at work (or home) but it's like all I want to do is light the world on fire. This white-hot rage at the drop of a hat. I can't stress enough how deeply my psyche is affected by the pregnancy hormones and stress of knowing I'll likely miscarry.\n* I have been pregnant twice this year. My weight has ballooned and my sense of myself has crashed. I work really hard to lose weight when not pregnant and then a pregnancy throws me into a tailspin of swelling and depression and stress eating. Since I'm high risk for miscarriage I am not allowed to keep working out. Grrr.\n* I have a beautiful, amazing 3-year-old.\n\n**Reasons to Try One More Time:**\n\n* There is a small chance I will conceive a viable and healthy baby. We're going to check on the percentage with the fertility specialist we're seeing, but my understanding is it's very small. Like 15% or so. I'm not sure if this percentage includes babies with or without chromosome issues.\n* Sweet, sweet baby smell from sweet baby head. This last pregnancy was full of phantom smells where I just smelled baby head and baby formula in random places and would start crying.\n* Another amazing little person to meet and be a part of our family.\n* A brother or sister for my kid.\n* I've wanted a second child since the moment we brought our son home.\n* My husband would understand if I decided I couldn't continue but he'd be so disappointed. I've told him I'm struggling and he knows I'm writing this here. He'll respect whatever decision I make, but I love him so much and hate to be the one to kill the dream.\n* **The doctor thinks we'll have better luck with Clomid.** I don't understand how this will help me. I ovulate just fine. Like a clock. I get pregnant in one try. I'm not kidding. My quality is crap. I can't imagine how super-ovulating multiple shitty eggs is going to help my chances when my chances are so poor to begin with.\n\n**So what should I do?**\n\n* Should I try the Clomid?\n* Should I stop trying?\n* Should I try something other than Clomid?\n* Should I try one more time (with medicine) but wait until November? This would be despite my doctor telling me not to wait because my egg quality is just going to keep dropping. November is when work calms down so I may be less stressed and it would be a better time of year to be off my rocker. Waiting also feels stressful. Being in limbo is really stressful for me.\n* Other variations on this?\n\nI'm really having a hard time allowing myself to back away from this journey. Lots of grief and disappointment but also a lot of fear around trying again without much of a chance. If you're wondering what I've done already I've been following the recommendations for Recurrent miscarriage in It Starts with the Egg since May.\n\nThanks in advance for any advice you can give.\n\n**Additional Info:** \n\nI'm going to start seeing a counselor who specializes in fertility and infertility issues. \n\nI've been seeing a RE since May. \n\nBaby adoption, donor eggs, and IVF are not viable options for us for multiple reasons. Primarily it is the cost and low chance of success for each option.

Just wanted to introduce myself, as I'm new here.\n\nMy background:\nMy husband and I got pregnant in early/mid-July without trying. I'd gone off my birth control, we figured it'd take a few months for my cycle to even out, and then in the fall we'd start actively tracking l when I was ovulating and trying. When we got the positive test after I missed my second period post-birth control, we were pretty shocked, but excited. We felt some pretty serious levels of being undeserving, or like we didn't \"earn\" the pregnancy, as we'd watched friends struggle with fertility. Coming to Reddit, I felt that even more strongly seeing all the acronyms and testing and conversation surrounding trying for a baby.\nBefore getting pregnant, we'd had a trip planned to Tahiti with another married couple who we're incredibly close with. We asked the doctors after finding out about the pregnancy to make sure it was still okay to go, and it was. Just the usual be vigilant about mosquito bites and don't drink the water, etc.\nUpon arriving in Tahiti last week, I went to the bathroom and saw blood in my underwear. I was just shy of 7 weeks. I immediately messaged my doctor, she said to monitor how much I was bleeding, consistency, and color. At first I was sure I was having a mc, but after doing some research it seemed possible that it was a SCH. We went from completely distraught to very cautiously optimistic. We of course couldn't see a doctor in Tahiti, so we spent our 9 day vacation just trying to put it out of our minds as much as possible until we knew for sure.\nWe got back into the states today, and I immediately went in for bloodwork. It confirmed that I had in fact had a miscarriage.\nWe're just so sad. I feel like my body has betrayed me and my husband. Why did it let me get pregnant so easily, just to lose it... Obviously things are still very raw. \nMy sister in law has had one loss and knew we were expecting, so she's been a great resource. But this sub is my new reality now, rather than the April 2020 Bumpers. Today I've found some comfort in hearing others' stories, so wanted to add mine in hopes it resonates with others, too.\nMy husband and I talked today and agreed we want to start trying again when we're cleared to do so.

I was worried of telling people about the pregnancy (despite being in a very stable position in life) for fear of judgement, despite it being what we both wanted, now I feel so guilty about that. I also felt guilty for my son, for lots of reasons I can't quite articulate, but also because I felt I didn't do my best as a mum for the weekend while I was grieving. I felt guilty for telling my close friend who had a miscarriage some months ago, because I do in fact have a living child.\nI also had two people dream I was pregnant with a girl, and just before I found out I was pregnant we spookily found a name tag in the mud on our doorstep with our chosen girls name we had picked from our son before we knew the gender, so I've also convinced myself it was a girl and I'm now thinking I can't carry girls.\nI guess I just need to vent somewhere people might understand?

I've typed up a lot of messages, but have never hit post. Or if I did hit post, I quickly deleted it. Nothing I have to say feels *right* to put out there. I'm currently wrapping up my second loss in three months. \n\nBackground: I had a chemical pregnancy in May-June and quickly got pregnant again with my June cycle. I got a positive pregnancy test at the end of June/beginning of July. When I went in for my 8-week ultrasound at the beginning of August we found out there was no heartbeat and that the pregnancy had stopped progressing around the 6-week mark. After a week of testing to confirm that I was in fact miscarrying, and not behind where I thought I was, I chose to take misoprostol to begin to end the pregnancy. I had to go back to the doctor this week for my OB to look at everything and see where I'm at hormonally and physically. Thankfully, the physical effects are almost over. Hormonally, I just have to wait and see. I go back in towards the middle of September for a non-pregnant vaginal ultrasound to see if there are any issues that the doctor can detect and to ensure that my body expels all of the products of conception so that we can try again sooner rather than later.\n\nI've been mostly okay emotionally. I understand logically that this baby wasn't meant to be born. It really wasn't until the other day after my appointment that I cried for the first time since I found out about the loss. This whole summer has been one letdown after another and ultimately we are ending the summer with no progress. I feel awful having these feelings because my husband and I are in a really good place and I am very grateful that we can enjoy more time together with just the two of us. But I can't help but we sad that this is all taking so much longer than I thought it would. I know I came into this naive and believing that it would be easy. That I would be pregnant by the end of the summer and have a baby in the spring. Now we aren't cleared to try again until around November, so the earliest we'll have our first baby is next summer.\n\nThere is a lot about all of this that I don't understand, and I know that I will never get those answers.

Husband and I have been TTC #2 for almost 2 years. The major problem comes from anovulation. So I\u2019ve been on clomid. And I can\u2019t tell y\u2019all how much money I\u2019ve spent on the ClearBlue Advanced Digital OPKs. I\u2019ll pee on those damn things every day, sometimes more than once a day. I have a stick and test strips in every bathroom. And I\u2019ve noticed that one stick is always negative/\u201clow\u201d. The other one is always a flashing smiling face indicating \u201chigh\u201d LH surge. I\u2019ve only ever had one solid \u201cpeak\u201d test, and that\u2019s when we conceived our last, which ended in a miscarriage. \n\nSo today I peed on both sticks at once, because it\u2019s annoying the piss out of me (pardon the pun). And sure enough, at the exact same time, one test strip had the stupid flashing face, as it\u2019s had for two weeks straight. And the other had a big old O, indicating nothing. Wtf is up with these tests? What\u2019s the threshold? They\u2019re both clear blue advanced digital tests. I\u2019m using the same stream of urine. Can I even trust this brand going forward??\n\n\nSo I\u2019m at my wits end with these tests. It\u2019s not my only method of tracking; temping has been a bitch to interpret this cycle, I\u2019ve had no other physical signs of O.

Just needing to talk about it with people who know WTF I\u2019m talking about, and get some support or commiseration or encouragement.\n\nStill waiting on karyotype and genetic carrier screening on my husband and I. Also waiting for my goddamn period to come so I can get my cycle day 3 testing, and what I call the pictures of my parts tests. (Ultrasound of ovaries, HSG, and the saline one). Semen analysis is later this week.\n\nThe two big things: my recently miscarried embryo was chromosomalLu normal. This was a standard cultured karyotype, not a microarray.\nI was very upset when I first learned this. Was hoping for a random trisomy, but I now know that it could have had some other random occurrence thing wrong with it that didn\u2019t show up. Thanks reddit users for telling me things my medical team didn\u2019t. \n\nMy AMH is 0.881\nAt age 35, they like to see it at 1.0 or above, but The patient care coordinator telling me my results said this is only a little bit low.  She said it\u2019s still a good number and not at all something to worry about. Obviously I\u2019m still worried because of course I am! Anyone have any feedback or advice about that number?\n\nEverything else normal. Thyroid, autoimmune, blood clotting, glucose, and whatever else they tested for was all good. Which I think is good?\nSucks there is no answer, and there might not be. But good there isn\u2019t a known major issue. I think.\n\nI also asked her about the possibility of  endometriosis and the receptivadx test. She said endo doesn\u2019t typically cause problems unless it\u2019s a blocked tube or something and laparoscopy isn\u2019t usually done unless it is really causing problems. Also they usually only do receptivadx test for people doing IVF, but that I should bring it up with my doctor at our follow up. Anyone have dissenting opinions on the endo thing? I have read some emerging studies about receptivity of the endometrium going in cycles and sub-clinical endo causing problems.  I will certainly bring this up with the RE at our follow-up visit once all tests are completed.\n\nI have not been diagnosed with endo, but my mom and I both had/have excruciatingly painful menstrual cramps. Mom conceived only once in 15 years of trying. I conceive easily but miscarry. Could be coincidence but I just wonder if there is something we could both have. \n\nReally hoping our karyotypes are normal and there is no translocation!!!\n\nThanks for listening.

For what it's worth, I did take a (negative) hcg test a couple days back just to verify it was negative so I know any positive test going forward is a new pregnancy.\n\nAny advice or thoughts welcome!", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "ttcafterloss", "subreddit_id": "t5_34scd", "subreddit_subscribers": 5959, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "First TWW (?) after my first miscarriage", "total_awards_received": 0, "updated_utc": 1566951844, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/ttcafterloss/comments/cvwnog/first_tww_after_my_first_miscarriage/"}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "ACakeInTheBreakroom", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_7cf4w6l", "author_patreon_flair": false, "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1566879441, "domain": "self.ttcafterloss", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/ttcafterloss/comments/cvzaqo/long_feeling_selfish_warning_trigger_hemorrhaging/", "gildings": {}, "id": "cvzaqo", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 6, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/ttcafterloss/comments/cvzaqo/long_feeling_selfish_warning_trigger_hemorrhaging/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1566879442, "score": 10, "selftext": "Hi everyone, \n\nI'm a lurker, not really a poster.  I have a pretty graphic story.  I'll try to keep it short and sweet, but please be cautioned I wouldn't want to trigger anyone.  I just really need somewhere to get this off of my chest tonight and maybe find someone with encouraging words.  \n\nTo give some background; two years ago I lost my youngest son Leighton at 25 Weeks.  He was admitted to the NICU after an emergency classical c-section.  At DOL 4 we discovered he had a Grade 4 brain bleed with a midline shift.  My poor baby was braindead and suffering.  I could tell something was different when I walked into the NICU that morning.  He was much more \"active\" squirming around, grimacing...I didn't know what to do or think.  When we were given our decision to provide comfort care or withdraw care, I didn't know what to do.  I didn't want my baby to suffer, but selfishly I wanted, prayed, hoped he would pull through..by some miracle it would all go away and he would live.  Ultimately, after consulting a chaplain, social services, many medical doctors, we decided to withdraw care and give our baby the most snuggles and comfort we could.  \n\nTo begin, I was 18 weeks pregnant and woke up in the middle of the night to go to the bathroom and began dripping bright red blood.  I went into the nearest ER where I was told I was having a miscarriage...and to go home.  This was devastating, what was even worse was worrying all weekend.  Luckily, I was able to get in that following Monday with my OBGYN.  This brought some peace as I found out that I wasn't having a miscarriage, in fact, the baby was healthy and fine.  I was put on pelvic rest and was sent home...feeling great.  Then, at 20 weeks, I again had a massive bleed in the middle of the night.  I returned to the ER and this time was admitted.  I was monitored and placed on bed rest in the hospital for 3 days.  By that time the bleeding had slowed to a rust brown and I was cleared to return home.  At 22 weeks, I again had another bleed.  I returned to the ER where I was admitted for the second time.  I was late in the 22d week and they made the decision to give me steroids for the baby, just in case.  I was told I would be admitted until the baby came, which was the scariest thing I ever heard.  I stayed at this hospital for one week until I was transferred to another hospital with a NICU capable of caring for an early infant.  At 25 weeks 1 day, I woke up in the morning and began to hemorrhage.  The toilet pan was filled with blood, the floor, my bed..it was everywhere.  I pulled the rip cord in the bathroom and before I knew it there were, what seemed like, a hundred people in my room.  I could not stop crying. Why was this happening, I was so angry, with myself, with God, with everyone around me.  I was moved from the antepartum wing to the labor and delivery floor, \"just in case\".  I knew what this meant for me.  I was hooked up to monitors, poked and prodded, then at around 5 PM that same night I began feeling intense contractions.  I called for a nurse who checked and I began pouring blood.  The look on her face still haunts me.  Within probably 5 minutes I was in the OR.  I remember hearing everything, I felt like again there were a million people in the room.  I heard them announce his time of birth: 5:23pm.  I never heard him cry.  He was placed in this little bag, as my husband recalls, placed under a warmer and immediately transported to the NICU.  It was well after midnight before I even knew if he survived.  There were many more medical complications (to include a punctured lung and a torn esophagus from medical negligence - in my opinion)...after-all it was a training hospital.  But I was optimistic, when I finally got to go see him I was so scared.  He was tiny, big for a 25 weeker (2 full pounds!!)..but still tiny.  So the story goes on and as you've already read, he does not make it.  But, I'll save those details for another day or a PM if anyone is truly interested...because I'm off topic at this point and torturing myself.\n\nAs it's already been written, it's been two years since all of this.  My husband and I have been trying now for a year and a half...we've done 6 months of fertility treatments after a year of trying without assistance.  With our first son it took us 4 years to get pregnant, our second took two, and now I'm afraid I'll never get pregnant again.  I'm afraid the trainees practicing the classical incision scarred me to the point of no repair.  I'm afraid that my stress and anxiety about it all is hindering my ability.  We already have MFI but with our current treatments, there is \"no issue\".  We are just \"secondary unexplained infertility.\"  I'm so exhausted, mentally, emotionally, physically.  I feel like no one around me understands the desire I have for more children or the stress I feel with all of my treatments.  I keep telling myself that I'm content, that if I never get pregnant again I will be okay.  But I'm such a liar...I want more kids...I always have!  I can't come to terms, I don't know how to accept it.  I feel so selfish.  I have a living child, and I feel so inadequate.  I feel like in wanting another child so bad, it's as if he is not enough.  He is, but I so badly want him to experience a sibling, I want him to have that bond for life, I want to grow my family.  He knows about his brother, we do not hide that.  He sometimes cries for him, I'm not sure why as he is somewhat young still.  He'll ask where his brother is, and we explain but inside it kills me little by little.  I have multiple friends and family members who are pregnant or have recently had babies...and while I'm so happy for them, I'm so sad.  I write my texts, with tears in my eyes, and tell them how I'm so happy, but I lie in bed and cry that this isn't and may never be me again.  \n\nI've been to bereavement counseling and marriage counseling.  I have come to terms and accepted where I'm at as far as my loss.  But as I continue to see other people carrying babies around the stores and park, I see pregnant ladies all around me...and I can't help but feel like I've lost so much more than my son.  I have friends who I've tried to confide in and they insult with \"well you could always foster or adopt,\" so I grin and say yeah, that's a great idea...but really...it's just different.  And this is why I'm selfish...because I want my children...I want to be pregnant....I want to have what everyone else gets....I guess I just need more...I know fostering and adoption is a great way to give children a chance...but I really just don't feel like I'm at that point where I can accept it's not going to happen...I'm doing doing the fertility treatments, because I need a break...but I really, really can't handle knowing I have no control...I can't just let go. \n\nI feel like I'm rambling, I probably look like more of an a\\*\\* that I intended to...and I'm so sorry this is so long.  If you're still with me, thank you.  I hope you all find peace.", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "ttcafterloss", "subreddit_id": "t5_34scd", "subreddit_subscribers": 5960, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "LONG: Feeling Selfish - Warning Trigger (Hemorrhaging)", "total_awards_received": 0, "updated_utc": 1566965828, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/ttcafterloss/comments/cvzaqo/long_feeling_selfish_warning_trigger_hemorrhaging/"}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "AutoModerator", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_6l4z3", "author_patreon_flair": false, "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1566889860, "domain": "self.ttcafterloss", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/ttcafterloss/comments/cw0vna/ttcafterloss_daily_discussion_thread_1_august_27/", "gildings": {}, "id": "cw0vna", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 33, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/ttcafterloss/comments/cw0vna/ttcafterloss_daily_discussion_thread_1_august_27/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1566889861, "score": 1, "selftext": "**How are you doing today?
