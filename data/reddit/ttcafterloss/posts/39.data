I suppose it has come full circle.\n\nThat arc does not make me sad, it makes me thankful. This day a year represented when I started actively reaching out for help and support, both from an RE and from a group of women who have known similar journeys. I feel so lucky to have found such an incredible wealth of knowledge, strength, support in these various subreddits throughout the course of this year.

We decided to go with the medical procedure and chose the manual vacuum aspiration (MVA) over the D&amp;C.

I layed down and they put in the pap smear spreader and I got a large shot in my cervix of local anesthesia. Once I was numb they use dialators to enter the uterus with a vacuum tube. This was the most painful part and caused me to have a few moments of intense cramping. They suctioned two or three times and then it was over. The entire procedure from start to finish was about ten minutes. As soon as everything was removed I instantly felt better.

Reading about the experiences of others helped me in the early days following my loss. I lost my baby boy Luka at 20 weeks in December 2016.\n\nI had a pretty uneventful pregnancy - I felt pretty good, apart from being extremely tired. It was a planned pregnancy and both myself and my partner were extremely excited to be parents. I had an 8 week ultrasound for dating and also paid for the NIPT test for screening plus gender. The NIPT can back with great results and low risk for all. We also found out we were having a baby boy. We named him Luka and we were looking forward to being parents. \n\nI requested a 13 week ultrasound just to check up on the little guy. The sonographer claimed all was fine - little Luka was quite active and I left this appointment feeling joyful, unaware of what was to come. I booked my 20 week ultrasound at another clinic and went on with my life unaware that my little boy was unwell. \n\nFast forward to my 20 week ultrasound. My little boy was kicking like crazy once again and my fianc\u00e9 looked so happy. The sonographer checked Luka's head and profile, when his whole demeanor changed. He asked me, \"If something was wrong, would you prefer that I tell you?\". My heart sunk whilst I responded, \"yes\". I knew something didn't look right but I didn't know what was happening. He simply said, \"I'm sorry, but something is very wrong - please go to the hospital, I will fax through the report as soon as possible.\" He apologised once again as me and my fianc\u00e9 left to go to the hospital. \n\nWe went back to the car and I broke down crying. I couldn't keep it together, I just cried and cried. I got to the hospital and asked them whether the report had come through from the sonographer. They told me they had not received it yet and I was asked to sit in the waiting room. I was surrounded by pregnant women there for their antenatal appointments. I couldn't handle this, waiting there surrounded by pregnant women whilst I knew something was very wrong with my baby, and eventually I broke down again until a nurse came to console me. I was then quickly seen by the obstetrician/doctor. \n\nIt was then explained to me that my baby had anencephaly. I had never heard of the term before and I was in a state of shock. My fianc\u00e9 broke out in tears whilst I sat there quietly taking all the information in. She, the doctor, advised it was \"incompatible with life\". My baby had no chance at survival. This was on a Friday and I agreed to be induced a few days later on Sunday. Feeling Luka kick on Friday night and Saturday killed me. I couldn't bear it knowing he would die on Sunday. I was broken. No one knew how this was not picked up at the 13 week ultrasound.\n\nI went in to hospital at noon on Sunday, was induced and Luka was delivered silent before midnight. I didn't hold him as I couldn't bear it. It was too much for me, I couldn't handle it. I don't regret it as I prefer the image I have of him in my mind. I took home a bear donated by another couple who had lost a baby, that is the only physical representation of him I have. Reliving the labor and delivery is hard as I have somehow managed to push it away deep within as it is too upsetting to think about now.\n\nI was discharged the following day. I remember leaving the hospital, hearing crying babies and seeing families celebrating the births of their babies. My and my fianc\u00e9 left feeling empty without our baby. I knew he was not well and I do not regret our decision, but this was the hardest thing I've ever experienced.\n\nI've had follow up appointments with clinical genetics which advised they did not know the cause, it was nothing I had or had not done. We are both healthy and young (myself 25 and my fianc\u00e9 24) with no history in the family of such abnormalities. This was a planned pregnancy so I was taking a prenatal with folic acid for months prior to conceiving. I've come to accept there are no answers. Doctors have advised me to take 5mg of folic acid (a large dose) when trying to conceive next to try lower the risk of another NTD, but I don't know whether I want to try again. \n\nMy fianc\u00e9 and I took turns crying in the early days after losing Luka. I would break down and he would comfort me, then he would break down and I would comfort him. It is all a blur now, but sometimes I find myself crying myself to sleep even months later. I avoided all friends and family for as long as I could as I couldn't cope explaining what had happened. I'm doing better now. It gets better with time, but it has changed me.

I experienced my miscarriage in August. Actually, I only knew I was pregnant for 6 days before it happened. It was my first pregnancy, and unplanned. My boyfriend and I had only been dating for a few months, but things felt right. Within those 6 days, I had wrapped my head around the fact that I was going to become a mother. We are young, (24/24) and I was afraid, but I've wanted to become a mother all of my life. At first I was so scared, but something clicked inside me, that this was something that I wanted. I didn't even know how bad I wanted it until suddenly it was taken from me. Over the course of a week, I went from deciding that I would leave law school to start our family together, to having to flip off that switch just as quickly as I had turned it on when the mc happened. My immediate family and my boyfriend's immediate family already knew. We are states apart attending grad school so it was extremely hard to deal with the loss not being able to be together. At first I didn't know if I should feel some sense of relief, that because it was unplanned and because I was going to have to leave school, if now I should just try and forget about it and continue with my plans. Needless to say, I've continued with my plans, but now we feel like that opened up a door that can never be shut, now. I never knew how badly I wanted to have a baby and start a family until I was denied that opportunity. I know my boyfriend is the one, and starting a family is extremely important to him, as well. But I am so. Scared. To even attempt again. I'm young and healthy, I've been an athlete my entire life. I don't do drugs. I drink occasionally. I've never been told that I would struggle to get pregnant. But I lost my first pregnancy. I never imagined that that would ever happen to me in a million years. I remember thinking, wow, this actually was unplanned, I wonder why it was so easy. And I had spoken way too soon. I haven't stopped wanting a baby since then. I can't emphasize enough how much I did NOT know I wanted, needed this in my life, until I couldn't have it anymore. It's all I see on Facebook, on tv, at the grocery store, etc. Babies everywhere. I know many of you ladies have experienced the same feelings. I'm jealous. My heart is still broken, I will never forget those 6 days where I laid in bed realizing that I wasn't alone. That there was a second person there. It's like something turned on the moment I saw the positive test, and I can't turn it off again no matter how hard I try. But I am so afraid to try again because I never want to feel as helpless and sad as I did/do after the loss.

He was born at 23 weeks 5 days and he weighed 1.6 lbs and measured 31 cm. Unfortunately, he was too small to make it and he passed on the morning of the 19th. (You can look in my post history for more information). It's been a week now since we lost him and it still doesn't feel like it's sunk in. I've hardly accepted that I even birthed him; that he's not inside of me anymore.\n\nPeople keep asking me how I'm doing, and I honestly don't know. I feel lost. The things I used to enjoy just seem meaningless and I don't know how to explain what's going on or what happened. I'm 20 and my boyfriend is 22, and no one has been able to give us any sort of reason as to why this happened to us. We found out we were expecting on November 4th, but none of our family/friends knew that we had been trying. We were scared, but we were so excited and so happy to have been given the opportunity. I went to every appointment, I bought prenatal vitamins the day I found out, we did everything we could. But still we didn't get to take him home. \n\nNow we're faced with trying again and even though we both know that we want children and we both know that we're ready, I'm so scared of what might happen and I know he is too. I think of terms like DPO and BFP/BFN and I thought they were behind me. I didn't think I would need to feel this way again, this hoping and praying and charting. And then they tell us to wait, and I just don't think it's fair. We waited 3 months to find out, and another 4 for him to come - we shouldn't have to wait any longer. I'm just so frustrated that I don't know what to do, and I feel so alone in my struggles that I don't know who to turn to.\n\nSo hello, my name is Jennifer and everyone says this is where I should turn..

I got a shower a little but later and when I got out I set down to see how much I was still bleeding. *graphic* I wiped and it felt weird so I looked down and seen something poking about a half an inch out of my vagina so I grabbed it with a baby wipe and pulled. \nIt was my placenta. I text my fianc\u00e9 at exactly 8:00 and asked him to come to the bathroom and see. \nWe waited out the next day because we both just knew, and didn't see the point in going to the er. \nThis morning I went for an ultrasound with no heartbeat. It was an incomplete miscarriage and I'm currently waiting on the pills to be filled to help my body along because I didn't want the surgery. \nMy baby died 24 hours after I seen it's beautiful little heartbeat.

So it's \"just one of those things\" which I don't really believe, because there has to be something that happened to cause his death, it doesn't make rational sense. So I started to think about my mom and her difficult pregnancies. \n\nMy mom suffered with preeclampsia all three of her pregnancies with us, but with an amazing amount of luck and good care from doctors we all survived. Her preeclampsia was so bad that her doctor suggested she stop having kids after her third daughter because she could die. I was her first child, she ended up having me at 7 months as an emergency c section because her blood pressure shot up, I was born at one pound and one ounce, and she basically lived in the NICU with me for months. I grew up to be normal, healthy and happy. Two years later she got a high risk OB and carried my sister to 36 weeks before another emergency c section, and seven years after that had a surprise pregnancy with my youngest sister which was another emergency section at 7 months. \n\nSorry I'm rambling but I always thought my mom had these issues because she was a smoker all her life, even while pregnant, so I glided carefree through my pregnancy while my mom was extremely paranoid for me the whole time because of her traumatic experiences. I did tell my OB a couple times my mom had preeclampsia but they all brushed it off. Then my son died. After, I asked the MFM I met if preeclampsia was genetic--she told me YES, it is. She then checked all my files immediately and became really intrigued by this, but my blood pressure was fine after labor. Anyway I'm thinking there's some kind of tie--did I suddenly get random preeclampsia out of nowhere, did my blood pressure shoot up for a few horrible hours and take my son's life, then go back down?\n\nI know genetically there may be some things...like MTHFR, which I have, and I'm thinking my mom has. Or maybe we both have another mild clotting disorder. Who knows. It just seems like too much of a coincidence between my mom and I, and despite my blood pressure being \"perfect,\" I was horribly swollen towards the end and I always wonder if this was why.\n\nOk I guess I'm really just rambling now. But at least my MFM took me seriously, even though it was too late :( and my OB didn't while I was actually pregnant. I feel like I should have insisted more that my mom had issues and I should be treated as high risk, but with great vitals all the time and the belief I had that she was a smoker, so that caused her problems, how could I have known? At least I'm in more competent hands next time.", "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "ttcafterloss", "subreddit_id": "t5_34scd", "suggested_sort": null, "thumbnail": "self", "title": "My mom &amp; I...what do you think?", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/ttcafterloss/comments/61zg6e/my_mom_iwhat_do_you_think/"}, {"author": "TheRedditorialWe", "author_created_utc": 1379742655, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_text": null, "author_fullname": "t2_d8fjk", "brand_safe": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1490722084, "domain": "self.ttcafterloss", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/ttcafterloss/comments/620t02/ectopic_in_january_trying_to_survive_pregnancy/", "gilded": 0, "id": "620t02", "is_self": true, "locked": false, "media_embed": {}, "num_comments": 9, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/ttcafterloss/comments/620t02/ectopic_in_january_trying_to_survive_pregnancy/", "retrieved_on": 1492460751, "score": 19, "secure_media_embed": {}, "selftext": "New to this sub, though I was pretty active on r/TFAB last year.

Everyone visited my other SIL's hospital room when she had her baby last year, and obviously mine when I was going through the worst thing possible. (That's always confusing to say because honestly it was so wonderful to see Raffael for the first time, but so horrible that he was dead. Wow, my life sucks. Lol.) Anyway, I was supposed to have the first grandson, but we just found out shortly after Raff's birth that, of course, she's having a boy. I am freaking out that I am going to hate her and this baby simply because it's going to be a constant reminder of what Raff was supposed to be.\n\nI don't have anything against this SIL, but I can't stand the thought of a baby boy being around at the holidays or family gatherings when it isn't Raff. Plus, he was supposed to be in the middle of the two babies. I can't even look at my other SIL's daughter anymore. I'm terrified that everyone will think I can just be happy about these babies and hold them and say, \"Awww how cute that your baby is alive.\" (Obviously joking has become a coping method.) \n\nI don't know how I'm going to avoid all the gatherings and holidays, or even if I should. I could barely contain my tears the last time I saw them all. We go to the same church, and so far I have run out of every service so no one will see me cry. I'm irrationally scared of bumping into someone I know and seeing their baby and them asking if I want to hold it.  Good gravy, could there BE more women with babies?? And despite the fact that I don't want everyone to see me cry, I don't want anyone to mistake that for me being \"okay\".\n\nHow are we supposed to handle all these confusing emotions and family situations when one (or more for some of us) of the most important people in our lives was just ripped away from us?

Let me start out by saying that I came off the pill at the end of May 2016; we started TTC in July. After coming off the pill, I would get 5-6 days of preperiod spotting (maybe some mild bleeding) and then get a period of 3-5 days. Although initially long, my cycles quickly normalized to 29-30 days despite this spotting. We got pregnant in October on our 4th cycle and miscarried in December at 9 weeks (baby stopped growing at 6 weeks and no heartbeat). After the miscarriage, my period came back at 5 weeks, and my cycles are now 30-31 days, which is fine. Except I still have this almost week of preperiod spotting. My periods are moderately heavy the first 2 days then lighter. I'm 32 now, I was on the pill for 9 years, and before that my periods were always normal. \nI'm actually an endocrinologist myself (peds tho so a little removed from the repro field) and I'm pretty convinced that I may have a progesterone issue, or at least would like to get it checked out because I think this spotting occurs at exactly the time implantation should be and may be interfering with that process. My obgyn suggested an ultrasound to check thickness; he doesn't seem too keen on labs so I will probably get those myself. He says progesterone supplementation is controversial, and he only recommends that we try for another 3 months before we see a fertility specialist. I did have an ultrasound last year to see if polyps could be causing the spotting, and nothing; also that was the first day of my period and my thickness was 5.1 mm. Even if I build up a good lining, I'm starting to shed it at the time when I most need it! \nI'm just so frustrated because we keep trying, and I see there's signs of a potential problem that could be fixed! And I feel like he's just not listening to me and using the old \"try for a year and then we'll see\". Anybody have a similar experience and what did you do? I started looking into natural ways to build up and stabilize lining and ordered vitamin B complex, vitamin E, and raspberry leaf tea. I looked into vitex, but it actually affects hormonal actions by working on the pituitary gland, and that makes me nervous. Also, it seems to work wonders for most but terribly for some. \nThanks in advance. \n\nUpdate: I started all the supplements (B6, E, C, raspberry leaf tea, pomegranate juice, zinc, magnesium, arginine) and am about to start bromelain for 5 days after my pos OPK. Interestingly I ran into one of our repro endos at the hospital and told her my story and she told me I should start progesterone! She said my story sounded pretty compelling for low prog, and it won't hurt to treat. So I'm starting tmrw for 2 weeks bc I had a pos OPK on Thursday. Completely bypassing my obgyn's advice but reading all of your stories and advice made me want to advocate for myself. I can't keep trying for a few more months if I could help fix a problem that I'm seeing symptoms of and understand now. Thank you for all your advice! Keeping my fingers crossed.

We've been trying to have a family for years. I finally became pregnant with my daughter after doing IVF. We were nervous but the weeks passed by. We survived the first trimester and she looked great at the 20 week anatomy ultrasound. My husband and I knew it would be a girl. We were so happy! My pregnancy was textbook and baby was doing fine. \n\nMy 28 week appointment was routine and we heard the heartbeat. I had an anterior placenta which made it difficult to feel movement. I was told this was normal and that kicks would feel softer than usual. My placenta was in the front and provided more cushioning. I didn't feel much movement days later. We heard her heartbeat recently and assumed everything was fine. Was she was having a lazy day? Did she just kick? I'm not too sure...it always felt so faint. I convinced myself that things were fine. She was probably moving and I couldn't feel it. \n\nI eventually decided to get checked out. It was too late. There was no heartbeat. I didn't think this could happen. I thought we were in the clear. My heart and soul shattered into a million pieces. This was 10 weeks ago. We named her Natalie. I still feel guilt and shame for not going in sooner. She had died and I didn't know. What kind of mother am I? She was the most important thing in my world and I couldn't save her. I was responsible for her and I failed. They told me there was nothing I could have done to change the outcome. Why can't I believe them? I feel broken beyond repair and am having a difficult time wrapping my head around it all. \n\nWe're still waiting on the final autopsy report. I've been warned that we may never have an answer. My OB/GYN thinks we're going to fall into the unexplained category. I tested negative for infection and clotting disorders. The preliminary autopsy report revealed her DNA was normal and her growth was on track. MFM thinks it was a cord accident based on what we know now. (That she moved into a bad position and cut off her supply, etc) A freak accident that shouldn't have happened. We ruled so many different things out. The placenta results are a huge piece of the puzzle that we don't have now. He made it sound like it ultimately comes down to the cord or placental issues. The final report takes anywhere from 12-16 weeks. I don't know what to think anymore. I just wish I had proof of what happened but I feel like I'll never know for sure. \n\nI miss her so much and never imagined living my life without her. I feel so lost without her. Her due date is next week and I don't know how I'm going to get through it. I keep thinking she should be here. Why is she denied her place on earth? I cry thinking about the person she would have been.

I usually have three days of OPK, so that's no biggie, I was excited to temp this morning and see if it spiked like it supposed to.\n\nBut last night I slept horribly, the dog had to go potty, my son started crying at 5am, and I really got no stretch longer than 2 hours. To top that off, he woke up just frantic and screaming ten minutes earlier than usual. I tried to temp real fast and let him cry it out, but I didn't get to let it finish. My temp was slightly higher than usual 98.1 vs 97.7 but nothing like the fun spikes every one get. But again I had to stop temping. Who're it even finished.

After being messaged and questioned and subsequently lectured on how I should be okay because \"there's always next time\" and \"well at least you have one!\", I made a little public service announcement. Thought I'd share it with you guys\n\n\"It's pregnancy announcement season, and as someone who is still trying to cope with a loss (albeit, rather unsuccessfully), please forgive me when I cut you out of my life the second I see that picture of the stick with those two beautiful lines. I don't hate you. I don't want you to suffer like we have and still do. I envy you, and I am ill equipped to deal with that feeling.\n\nI've never been an envious person. I've never dealt with the hollow feeling I now get in my chest with every new announcement. I've never had to deal with it, and now that I have to, I'm doing a pretty terrible job. \n\nI am happy for you, but that doesn't mean I want to hear all about it. So when I make a conscious effort to avoid you, know that it isn't anything you've done. It's me. It's all me.\n\nI have a beautiful child, and I understand that I am blessed. But please don't tell me that I should be grateful I have one and act as if my loss is meaningless because I have a child. Don't talk to me about it like I should be over it, because it isn't that simple. It's a daily struggle I am suffering through, one minute I'm fine and the next I'm in tears. But that's not the me you'll see. You'll ask me and I'll tell you I'm okay because it's easier to lie than it is to tell the truth. And let's be honest, noone wants the truth anyways. The truth isn't easy or pleasant.\n\nLife isn't rainbows with clouds at the bottom so when you slip you'll still land somewhere cushiony and soft. No. Life can be dark, and it can be devastating. Yes, its been almost 3 months since we lost the baby, but greif isn't a 12 step program to being okay again. It's a process, and sometimes it takes longer than others deem acceptable. It sucks, and I'm sorry if I make you uncomfortable, but I'm uncomfortable too.

She had me go have an ultrasound done just to check things out, and turns out I had a blighted ovum. I was supposed to have been almost 10 weeks at that time and the yolk sac only measured 9. So the midwife said it could take up to 4 weeks to start to miscarry on my own which she recommended over a d&amp;c. I started having some bleeding a week after that appointment and have had some kind of bleeding (from very light to very heavy) ever since. It's been almost two full weeks since it started and I wanted to know how long it normally lasts? I'm wondering if I need to call them back and get checked out or if this is normal. Also, since I track my cycle, should I chart all the bleeding days? Will it mess up the algorithms? I never really did bbt charting, only CM and occasionally opks, so I'm hoping it doesn't mess things up too much to where I might miss prime days when we start trying again.

My husband and I never planned on having a baby, and we certainly never planned to lose it. We thought parenting wasn't for us and not a life we wanted. But life changes, and when, at the age of 38, my husband decided he wanted to try, I thought, ok, why not? We've been together 20 years. We could make room for someone new. Hell, if we get pregnant and we miscarry, no big deal, it happens to lots of women. We will just pick up and move on. It's better to try than wonder. \n\nWe got pregnant the month after I went off the pill, and I went through a host of emotions ranging from panic and anxiety to acceptance and joy. (It took a while!) We had all the tests done. We found out we were having a little girl. And at our twelve week appointment, all excited to hear the heartbeat, we learned we had lost the baby at 7w3d and I had been carrying around an embryo that had stopped living for five weeks without knowing it. I still cry when I think about it and felt like I needed to reflect on the positive things this miscarriage has brought to my life... even though they seem small in comparison to the loss I felt.\n\nHere's what I learned.\n----------------------------------\nI know what heartbreak is. \nI had lost people in my life that mattered. I had cried and grieved. But at that \"let's just check\" ultrasound, when I saw the tiny little embryo without a beating heart, I literally felt something break inside of me. The hysterical sobbing and complete breakdown at the doctor's office was NOTHING compared to what I would go through when I got home and the reality set in. (What to do with the Doppler? The maternity clothes? The subscriptions to newsfeeds? The maternity pillow? Answer - have husband hide them before I burn them all!)\n\nA miscarriage isn't \"no big deal\".\nThe level of depression and grief I felt after my loss was profound. I instantly kicked myself for what may have come across as nonchalant responses to my friends who had suffered the same disappointment. I couldn't believe how callous or unprepared I was to support them. I can do so much better now for the other women in my life.\n\nI have learned sensitivity and empathy.\nI certainly wouldn't announce to anyone now how \"easy\" it was to get pregnant. Or talk incessantly about my pregnancy in mixed company. I'm now all too aware of how common miscarriage is, how hard women have suffered to get pregnant and stay pregnant, and now I know how much seeing another pregnant woman can hurt to the core. \n\nI know what NOT to say.\nI know not to tell a woman who has miscarried that \"miscarriage is so common, you should have expected this\" or that \"it happened for a reason\" or \"nature was just taking care of a mistake\" or \"at least you got pregnant at all\". I know not to tell a woman that \"everything will be ok\" or \"you'll get pregnant again\" because that just isn't true for everyone. Now I know to say how sorry I am, listen, and offer whatever support my friends want to have. Everyone is different. But no one wants to hear any of the statements above.\n\nI should listen to my body and trust my instincts.\nWhen the intense nausea dropped off at the 8th week but the other symptoms remained, I listened to my doctor when they said the B6 was working. I listened to my husband when he said i was being anxious and everything was fine. I listened to everyone except me... I felt like something was wrong but we had seen the heartbeat a few days before so I felt like I was crazy for feeling anxiety. I wasn't crazy. I should have spoken up for myself and demanded a reassurance scan. It might have saved me the additional five weeks of growing excitement for a pregnancy that wasn't viable. \n\nI am capable of change.\nI was so worried I would make a lousy mom. I was so worried I could never see a future with a baby. The instant I learned I was pregnant, my mind shifted. I started putting someone else ahead of myself. I had a tiny taste of what being a mother might be like... to always put someone else's needs ahead of my own even though we hadn't met. It's also amazing to me how quickly I reverted back to my old habits and frame of mind after the loss... the human mind is an adaptable thing.\n\nI have experienced a true miracle.\nI didn't realize how hard it is to get pregnant and stay pregnant. I didn't know what an absolute miracle it is to have everything work out at exactly the right moment. For all cells to be in the right place at the exact right time. To make it through that first four weeks. I didn't realize that every pregnancy, no matter how short, was a miracle in that it ever happened at all. I don't see miracles in the every day but I now see pregnancy as just that - a moment of magic and timing. I'll always have that, whether or not I ever get pregnant again.\n\nI have no control.\nI don't know what happens next. Sure, we're trying again but nothing has happened and frankly, just getting my cycle back to normal after the D&amp;C is taking months and months. There is less joy in me this time around as I know what can happen and that bad things can indeed happen to me. But I do know now that it wasn't my fault. That what happened happened. I can't stop it from happening again. But I can take a leap of faith and give it another go.\n\nMiscarriage shouldn't be a secret or a shame.\nThe number of women who reached out after my mc astounded me and gave me great comfort. It felt good to be supported and know that I wasn't alone. We had told half the universe when we found out we were having a girl at 11 weeks thinking we were safe and literally had to make some terrible phone calls two days later. But the community of women who held me and carried me through (including this group of women) was unbelievable.\n\nSorry for the ramble. I just needed to get some positive things out there because most days I don't feel positive at all and I think the first pregnancy was a fluke and it will never happen again. If it doesn't, I think I'll be ok because I know so much more than I did before. But July 21st will always hurt (due date). I will always look at pregnant woman and families with a little hurt now. I'm hopeful that the things I've learned will carry me through. Thanks for letting me vent.

It's been building up, all the grief from my losses plus my now increased infertility (fuck you, pcos) that I felt like I really needed to talk about it. It's so isolating and is such a heavy burden to carry, yet it affects so many individuals and couples but no one talks about it. I think about it being similar to how mental illness was handled. Now mental illness is more openly talked about, understood, and accepted. I hope we can reach that point with pregnancy loss and infertility as well. Anyway, sorry for my rambling I'm all nerves. Here's what I posted.  \n\n\"My first miscarriage was devastating, the second has been almost unbearable. In the past four months we've lost two pregnancies, two babies that we thought would be ours forever. I'll never have the words to describe the pain that accompanies these losses, only that it leaves you a different person than you were before. Not a day goes by where I don't think about who they would have been. When you have a miscarriage you don't just lose a pregnancy. You lose a lifetime of experiences that were supposed to come with it. The thing is, unfortunately my story isn't rare or even uncommon. Many women struggle with PCOS and the infertility that comes with it. 1 in 4 pregnancies end in miscarriage. This has been the hardest thing I've ever gone through, and frankly, it hurts more than I can say. Grief isn't something you get over, it's something you learn to live with and it becomes part of you. It's even harder to try to live your life as though you haven't just experienced something so heart breaking you can barely leave the bed. This is a topic that deserves to be talked about and this is me doing my part in removing the stigma surrounding miscarriage and loss. (DH) and I picked out this necklace in honour of the second baby we never got to meet and I'm grateful for the physical reminder that that little life existed and mattered.\"", "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "ttcafterloss", "subreddit_id": "t5_34scd", "suggested_sort": null, "thumbnail": "self", "title": "After all the talk about posting on social media, I finally did it", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/ttcafterloss/comments/63oja3/after_all_the_talk_about_posting_on_social_media/"}, {"author": "AutoModerator", "author_created_utc": 1325741068, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_text": null, "author_fullname": "t2_6l4z3", "brand_safe": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1491462284, "distinguished": "moderator", "domain": "self.ttcafterloss", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/ttcafterloss/comments/63resz/ttcafterloss_ttc_daily_discussion_thread_april_06/", "gilded": 0, "id": "63resz", "is_self": true, "link_flair_css_class": "ttc", "link_flair_text": "TTC Thread", "locked": false, "media_embed": {}, "num_comments": 53, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/ttcafterloss/comments/63resz/ttcafterloss_ttc_daily_discussion_thread_april_06/", "retrieved_on": 1494566832, "score": 5, "secure_media_embed": {}, "selftext": "**This thread is for members who are TTC or waiting to try.

I spent my time lurking on r/TryingForABaby, r/cautiousbb, r/babybumps, r/miscarriage; I think this sub is the place for me. \n\nBackground: I removed my Mirena IUD in March 2016. DH and I started NTNP from May. Got my first positive ever in October, at the appointment at 7w&amp;6d there was a gestational sac and yolk sac with no fetal pole. Ten terrible days later it was confirmed to be an anembryonic pregnancy (blighed ovum). Had a D&amp;E (vacuum procedure in the doctors office) at 9w4d. Three days after my procedure, I went on a solo trip, this helped clear my mind and kept me away form the christmas revelers. \n \nWe were NTNP after the first miscarriage and to our surprise managed to conceive on the first cycle. This time, we wanted a late ultrasound so that we would not be in limbo again. The 10w ultrasound found  a gestational sack and yolk sac and no fetal pole.. deja vu. today at 11w I went in for a D&amp;E. My manager at went through the same process with his wife. He asked me to take as much time as I need. I am lucky to get the day off and recover, make a reddit account and join this group.  \n\nI am currently tired, mentally and physically of being in first trimester the past 5-6 months. I am numb from all the sadness. DH is very loving and supportive, he is keeping me sane. Our plan is to prevent for a few months and run some basic tests. \n\nI found this sub to be of great help after my 1st miscarriage and was following your 30 day challenge of reading books and running. You all are such a great support system. You give me hope. Thank you and I wish we all get our take home babies. \n\nTL;DR intro, two back-to-back anembryonic pregnancies in past ~6 months.

I'm so glad there is a space for us, but so sad at the same time. So many conflicting emotions going on in my brain.\n\nI just experienced a miscarriage this past week while moving across the country- it sucked (to say the least).\n\nMy husband and I have been trying since July, after a suspected chemical in June when I went off birth control and got a super faint positive before getting my period.\n\nThis time was different, I had three different brands of hpt, even a digital, all confirming that yes we were actually pregnant. Needless to say we were over the moon. We told my mom, my husbands mom, and two very close friends. Every time we told someone we said \"we know it's super early so anything could happen\" but it really didn't prepare me even though I was super cautious with my excitement. UGH. Then, on the night before we left for our 3000 mile car ride I wiped and found bright red blood.  I took an hpt the next day when we got to our first destination- still pregnant.. remained optimistic.  The next day though, I bled heavily with terrible cramps. I suspected I was losing the pregnancy but we stayed optimistic because I was still having so many symptoms. Fast forward to this morning- negative hpt- went to the er because of pain and they confirmed a completed miscarriage.  I was almost six weeks. I'm so sad and disappointed.. and angry. \n\nMy main issue I'm dealing with right now is feeling really guilty about telling the people we told and having to be the barer of bad news.  I have OCD, so this whole thing has made my brain turn in on itself in terms of my anxiety and guilt feelings that come with it and are usually under control (thanks to Wellbutrin).\n\nMy heart is broken for all of us here.  Thank you so much for being here- I'm not sure how I would cope otherwise. \n\n\n\n", "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "ttcafterloss", "subreddit_id": "t5_34scd", "suggested_sort": null, "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Introduction (TW- CP, MC)", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/ttcafterloss/comments/64a9sp/introduction_tw_cp_mc/"}, {"author": "AutoModerator", "author_created_utc": 1325741068, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_text": null, "author_fullname": "t2_6l4z3", "brand_safe": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1491721484, "distinguished": "moderator", "domain": "self.ttcafterloss", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/ttcafterloss/comments/64bwy6/ttcafterloss_ttc_daily_discussion_thread_april_09/", "gilded": 0, "id": "64bwy6", "is_self": true, "link_flair_css_class": "ttc", "link_flair_text": "TTC Thread", "locked": false, "media_embed": {}, "num_comments": 26, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/ttcafterloss/comments/64bwy6/ttcafterloss_ttc_daily_discussion_thread_april_09/", "retrieved_on": 1494577035, "score": 5, "secure_media_embed": {}, "selftext": "**This thread is for members who are TTC or waiting to try.
