I know that different labs have different ranges, and the best is to wait to talk to my doctor, but this is happening also in the middle of the TWW and I\u2019m starting to overthink. Since my miscarriage in February I\u2019m having cramping around 5DPO until my period (no cramping then) that I did not have before I got pregnant. We also suspected a chemical pregnancy first cycle we tried after the loss and my doctor thinks that the cramping might be that the egg gets fertilized and it\u2019s fighting to stay but it fails :( And I guess low progesterone levels will explain it, right? I will appreciate any feedback or experiences about the topic. \t", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "ttcafterloss", "subreddit_id": "t5_34scd", "subreddit_subscribers": 3578, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Day 21 Progesterone results", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/ttcafterloss/comments/8u6aie/day_21_progesterone_results/"}, {"author": "AutoModerator", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1530083520, "domain": "self.ttcafterloss", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/ttcafterloss/comments/8u7jzt/ttcafterloss_ttc_daily_discussion_thread_june_27/", "gilded": 0, "id": "8u7jzt", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 20, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/ttcafterloss/comments/8u7jzt/ttcafterloss_ttc_daily_discussion_thread_june_27/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1530083521, "rte_mode": "markdown", "score": 3, "selftext": "**This thread is for members who are TTC or waiting to try.

Things are bad and I need some community, hopefully I'm doing this intro post right. I'm 39 and my SO is a year younger. We've been married for quite some time (almost 10 years) and though we had a three year period of trying near the beginning of our marriage, we kind of gave up on trying some years in (but not preventing), until I surprisingly got pregnant for the first time ever last year. I found out about 4 weeks in but had a MC at 6 weeks in September of 2017. We didn't tell anyone except the midwife I had started seeing. All my friends locally are kind of gossipy and we were worried that people would find out we were trying (we weren't, but we are now) and affect our job prospects or that it would get back to our families. I finally told my best friend this year (she lives farther away and doesn't know my local friends) and she has been amazing.\n\nThe months after the MC were awful as I imagine they were for all of you too. I had weddings to attend and there were many tiny babies in attendance, one friend pressed her baby into my arms and walked away to do something, which was devastating to say the least. The holidays were hell. My SO has been nothing but supportive, but he's one person. He can't take all of this either, he also really wants children. Fast forward to this year where I feel like I have been rebuilding myself, charting, trying again. My cycles have been rock solid since January until this month. Since about April of this year, I was just chugging along emotionally, feeling better and almost completely able to deal with friends with children or friends who are pregnant. This month I felt like we might have timed things very right and my period was 8 days late. I was out at a camping event when I was late, and didn't have any tests with me. When I got home it was BFNs but I considered that maybe it was a late ovulation and finally told my SO yesterday morning, at 9 days late. A few hours after he went to work I started bleeding. It was really heavy and crampy and so yeah probably not implantation bleeding. It brought everything up again. I have been a wreck since yesterday. It's either a really late cycle or an early MC. Either way it has been awful.

After two years of trying, we got our first positive but beta number was 12- so we braced for miscarriage. Then the number more than doubled consistently so we were told we were possibly ok after all. Then, two days before the first ultrasound I started having sharp pains (though no blood). My fertility clinic told me to go straight to the ER. At this point I\u2019m feeling like it\u2019s probably ectopic and after the longest ultrasound I\u2019ve ever had, the ER doc confirmed that it was and had already ruptured so we\u2019d have to go into surgery. \n\nMy husband and I try to process this for a couple of hours until the surgeon shows up (so the rupture must not have been too bad). Surgeon then tells us that because of the location (on my ovary), it\u2019s likely a cyst and not the embryo. Hope lit us up and when I came out of the surgery my husband and I were in tears as the doc said it looked like a cyst so embryo might be just fine, we\u2019d repeat beta in a couple days. \n\nThen this morning when we were heading out the door for the lab, the surgeon called to say that the report on the tissue had come back and it was the embryo after all. I just had an incredibly rare ovarian eptopic. Still did the blood work to make sure hcg was going down but I won\u2019t have the results until Monday. Heterotopic pregnancy is a possibility, but the odds are akin to winning the lottery. \n\nAside from the sad, I\u2019m scared to start another medicated cycle. On the one hand, we found a protocol that worked. But on the other hand, the surgery was scary and knocked me on my butt. I have a month to think about it and the doc is going to talk to me sometime next week. \n\nI don\u2019t know how to feel right now.

Tested this morning with a cheapy from the dollar store (how I got my positives from my 2 prior pregnancies before anything else picked it up) FMU and the whole thing, super clear, super obvious negative.

This marks the end of \"Month 2\" on Femara. Again, with nothing to show for it.\n\nI have an appointment with my OB/GYN Wednesday morning to discuss what we are going to do moving forwards. I had my day 21 bloodwork done a couple weeks ago so we can look over that and see if that gives us any indication of what's happening and I'm going to bring up some things I've noticed in the last few months.\n\nI just don't get it. How can I go from one of those lucky bitches who get pregnant at the drop of the hat (seriously it was stupid the 2 times I got pregnant how \"easy\" it was) and now this. A full year of trying and no luck. Not even a squinty line. I think that's what makes this all the more difficult to swallow and deal with. I'm tired of it, I just want to be pregnant, I want another baby, but I don't want to keep trying only to be disappointed each month when I need to go buy more tampons and all this bullshit again and again. I want a glorious ~12 months of no period (okay with the like 6-8 weeks of awful period from hell that is recovering from having a baby). \n\nPart of me wants to push for the OB to go ahead with the original plan of taking me in for surgery, do the D&amp;C, do the flush/scope of both tubes to check for blockages, and potentially remove the largest of the cysts that got investigated a few months ago. But I also don't want to be holed up all summer and having to recover from surgery like that. (Also the ability to take time off during the summer right now at work is a GD nightmare, so I don't really know if I'll even be able to take the time off in the next 6 weeks. Which means ANOTHER 2 or so months of waiting before we get another round of treatment plan and then the obvious recovery time for the surgery itself). Which will bring us to nearly 2 years since our loss itself.\n\nI'm angry, and upset, and just ugh. I tried posting something on the fertility subreddit and it did not go well and I'm feeling particularly unwelcome there (for anyone here who has cross over between the subs, please don't take that the wrong way). So I feel like I can't even get any suggestions/help there as I'm just not comfortable posting in that community.\n\nI don't know, I'm all over the place and just feeling down because I was so fucking hopeful this month.

It was a blighted ovum, resolved with cytotec. I was pregnant again soon after, and delivered a healthy baby girl. \n\nAfter a year and a half, we decided to expand our family. Which lead to a new pregnancy in July of 2017. We saw the heartbeat  in september and fell in love. Then saw no heartbeat on the nuchal translucency scan one week later. This missed miscarriage was resolved with two doses of cytotec. \n\nI knew for sure I wanted to try again in December. And was pregnant again February of 2018. This was also a missed miscarriage with at least 2 gestational sacs (at one point the obgyn thought she saw three), but no embryos. My obgyn had me wait a month \"just in case\" there was growth in either sac. There wasn't. I began cytotec on 5/23 and after two rounds completed the miscarriage. Every round of cytotec I've had is more painful and involves more bleeding than the last. I'm still waiting for my next period. \n\nAt this point, I feel absolutely hopeless about having another pregnancy.  I know the statistics about 25&amp;#37;-33&amp;#37; of pregnancies ending in miscarriage and just having bad luck. I might have even bought into it after two miscarriages. But at this point it seems clear to me that the statistics are different for me. Whatever ball game I'm playing, the rules are not the same. I just saw my obgyn for my last follow-up, but she did not suggest or recommend any further testing. She told me to wait until I'm sure I'm emotionally ready but then know that I have a 1/3 chance of miscarriage going forward because of my age (**I just turned 38**). She's laying the blame there. \n\nWhat is next for me? Do I give up now and enjoy my family, my career, and my life? Life is good and I want to be present to enjoy it. I've spent so much of the last four years pregnant, miscarrying, or postpartum... everything else has been a bit of a blur. I know, given my age, that stepping off the roller coaster is something of a final decision. I logically know that I haven't done anything wrong and that I didn't cause this, but I still feel heartbroken and as if I somehow failed. There's been a lot of pain and suffering, both physically and emotionally. I don't feel like doing anything. I've gained a lot of weight. I am not able to give myself 100&amp;#37; to either my family or my work. Everything is hollow and empty (I'm in treatment for depression). \n\nOn the other hand, I still have that deep desire to have another baby. I ache when I see pregnant women or newborn babies. I am so sad to think that my daughter will never have a sibling. If I had a reason for why the miscarriages were happening, I could cleanly either let go of that desire or pursue it. I need create some sort of narrative out of all this.\n\nSo that's where I am. Give up. Keep going with it. Seek out a second medical opinion. I'm not sure what to do next.

The urine test at her office was negative, and they're doing a blood test to confirm that I was pregnant at all. \n\nWaiting at the lab there were 3 pregnant women and children everywhere.

The size of a poppy seed, small enough that you wouldn't even notice it leaving. After all if I hadn't taken that first test I never would have known. I would have thought it was an extra late period, extra sore breasts, no big deal. I had less than 24 hours to get used to the idea, and truthfully I didn't believe it would be viable anyway. \n\nI know it wasn't my fault, it wasn't anything I did, and anyway it's good to have confirmation that it's even possible after more than a year of trying.

So I know that cycles after a D&amp;C can be weird, but I am just so confused. I had my D&amp;C on 4/25, spotted for about 10 days and that was that. I didn\u2019t have any kind of spotting until 6/8, where I\u2019d had some pms symptoms and i had some brown light flow about 10am-12pm, then slowed down to spotting. Same thing the following day. No spotting 6/10, so I didn\u2019t mark 6/8 as CD1. The same thing happened again on 6/11, but was slightly more(but still light and brown) so I marked CD1. This continued through my cycle with varying degrees of  light flow, but only in the morning or afternoon. It always went to spotting at night.\n\nWell I had a positive OPK on CD11, which was the first time I was able to test because I\u2019d still been bleeding, so I assumed I wouldn\u2019t get a surge(I usually O CD25). I tested again with smu and at night and didn\u2019t get anything close to positive, and haven\u2019t since.\n\nI had a temp spike on CD15, but FF doesn\u2019t give crosshairs unless I disregard my high temp from CD11. My temps have stayed relatively high. I have been trying(and failing to properly use) my ferning microscope and haven\u2019t gotten any kind of discernible pattern. Didn\u2019t receive it until CD12.\n\nThe last three days I have been spotting red from about 9-11am. Nothing afterwards. No idea why.\n\nHas anyone had random spotting like this before? I don\u2019t get it at all. I\u2019m kind of worried I\u2019m not going to ovulate, my cm dried up after that temp spike and I\u2019m not sure what to think. If I did O I\u2019d be 7DPO.

If I pin my current cycle on the start of my previous pregnant chart it follows the pattern, but it also follows the post ovulation pattern if I pin on O.

I\u2019m looking forward to connecting with people who\u2019ve had similar experiences, and I\u2019m really glad this community exists.  \ud83d\ude42", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "ttcafterloss", "subreddit_id": "t5_34scd", "subreddit_subscribers": 3597, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Intro - Stillbirth @ 25 weeks", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/ttcafterloss/comments/8vbctr/intro_stillbirth_25_weeks/"}, {"author": "SunfireMoon", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1530468667, "domain": "self.ttcafterloss", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/ttcafterloss/comments/8vbt12/fullterm_stillbirth_looking_for_support_and_hope/", "gilded": 0, "id": "8vbt12", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 13, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/ttcafterloss/comments/8vbt12/fullterm_stillbirth_looking_for_support_and_hope/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1530468668, "rte_mode": "markdown", "score": 54, "selftext": "In march I gave birth to my first child, my daughter.

My fiance and I are currently still long-distance so we're not planning to TTC until around 2021, but we very much want children and I'm terrified the miscarriage I had in the spring might be indicative of something wrong with me or an otherwise recurrent issue.\n\nI had a missed miscarriage at about 7 weeks back in April. The pregnancy itself was a huge surprise as it was an IUD failure pregnancy. When I first found out I was pregnant my HCG measured only 79, and I found out about the miscarriage when they did repeat bloodwork nearly two weeks later and my HCG had fallen by nearly half. When they did the ultrasound, it turns out the fetus wasn't forming right at all. There was a fetal pole, but no yolk sac and no heartbeat, and the gestational sac was an \"irregular cystic mass\". I saw the ultrasound photos and where it should have been round, it was all lumpy. The gestational sac was full of cysts. It wasn't a molar pregnancy of any sort - my HCG was low, not high - but I can't find anything online that gives any clue as to why the sac would be like that, nor can I really find other reports of the same thing happening to other people. My GP has said by her best guess it was probably a random genetic defect and not likely to happen again, at least not at any increased risk, but I'm really scared. My partner and I are going to start trying to conceive in about three years (I'm in the process of immigrating to the US to be with him so we want to get settled first) and I'm absolutely terrified that this is going to be a recurrent problem because I don't know how many times I can go through this. Is there anything that indicates any kind of fertility problem or the potential for recent miscarriages, or did I just get really unlucky?\n\nI'm 26 years old, have a history of extremely mild endometriosis but nothing that would have kept me from getting pregnant (and it was removed 7 years ago). I have hypermobility spectrum disorder (which in my case, presents very similarly to hypermobile Ehlers-Danlos), mild dysautonomia (orthostatic intolerance), and a history of kidney reflux (corrected with surgery, but with some very mild residual kidney damage). I take lyrica, nabilone, wellbutrin abilify, trazodone, and tecta, but was told that none of these medications posed anything more than a slightly increased risk of birth defects, and that was only one or two of them. Nobody in my family has fertility problems or has had miscarriages that they know of. I'm 5'7 and 165 pounds, so a little overweight, but not obese. I don't smoke or drink at all.\n\nI think I know when the actual miscarriage occurred, as I started to feel extremely sick the night before the repeat bloodwork was done. I started alternating between chills and feeling overheated, and I threw up a bunch. I thought it might have been food poisoning, but nobody else who ate the same thing got sick.", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "ttcafterloss", "subreddit_id": "t5_34scd", "subreddit_subscribers": 3602, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Early missed miscarriage w/cysts in gestational sac - am I at risk of a recurrent problem?", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/ttcafterloss/comments/8vf6ds/early_missed_miscarriage_wcysts_in_gestational/"}, {"author": "bnelches", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1530510475, "domain": "self.ttcafterloss", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/ttcafterloss/comments/8vg9tf/leaking/", "gilded": 0, "id": "8vg9tf", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_css_class": "question", "link_flair_richtext": [{"e": "text", "t": "Question"}], "link_flair_template_id": "64bc0a4e-a73f-11e4-8d5c-22000bc1c25f", "link_flair_text": "Question", "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "richtext", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 12, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/ttcafterloss/comments/8vg9tf/leaking/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1530510476, "rte_mode": "markdown", "score": 1, "selftext": "Lost my baby at 13 weeks, had the D&amp;C on Friday and Sunday evening my breasts started leaking.

My sister also annouced she was pregnant for the first time and due only a week before me! My family was estatic, as were my sister and I. We even decided to have our baby shower together. \n\nFast forward several months and we found out our baby has Trisomy 18 and will not survive so unfortunately we decided to terminate at 17 weeks. It was the hardest decision I have ever had to make and I think about her every single day. Her name was Madeline. She passed away April 13th. I know it has been a couple months but I still really struggle with it and definitely have some sort of depression because of it. I have been to a counselor a couple times but it really hasn't helped. I'm also 38 so really nervous to get pregnant again because I'm scared it could happen again. \n\nMy sister's baby shower is this weekend. It was supposed to be my baby shower as well. Our family is huge and will all be there. I'm really dreading it because my family is very nosey and in your face and I don't want to start bawling in the middle of my sister's shower. My crazy aunt will also be there and I don't want to see her. She is so crazy in fact, she went on my FB page and wrote a comment on there saying something about how she knew God wanted my baby and that is why she died. WTF?! I blocked her and haven't spoke to her since. She is a super religious freak and I know she will start talking about God and how he works in mysterious ways, it was the right thing, everything happens for a reason, blah, blah, blah. You know, all the stupid shit people say that only make you feel worse. \n\nI also told my mom and sister n law throwing the shower that I wanted nothing to do with it. I don't want to help plan a shower that was also supposed to be my shower. That I just wanted to show up for a bit and be there for my sister and then take off. Now last weekend, a week before the shower my mom asks me to find someone that makes cupcakes and bring those to the shower and then yesterday asked me to also make some sort of a salad and bring that too! This is after I told her I wanted nothing to do with this. I'm super depressed about losing Madeline just a couple months ago and worrying about never having kids myself and I don't think I should have to help with this shower in any way. I don't even want to be there and worry I will have a break down or something. Am I a total bitch for telling my mom no? Telling her that I just want to show up? Am I being selfish? I really don't know how to handle this and I'm freaking out and have major anxiety about the whole thing.

I was due August 21st, 2018. On June 8th I lost my mucus plug and went to the hospital. I was found to be leaking amniotic fluid a bit, and after an ultrasound we found out my daughter had hydrops fetalis, which is fluid collecting in multiple areas. For our daughter it was her scalp, around her lungs, and in her abdomen. I also had polyhydramnios so I looked like I was full term. We were transferred to a hospital with a tier 3 NICU. I was stable and so was our daughter, but due to the leak we had to stay in the hospital. Hydrops babies have a 50% shot at surviving childbirth, and then if they survive that they have a 50% shot at making it to 28 days. As our time in the hospital went on the hydrops got worse and I was scheduled for a c section the next day. Except that night, June 18th, I went into labor, going from 3 to 4 cm in an hour, so I went right in for a c section. She was born at 11:17 pm. I won\u2019t go into details, but she was intubated and had a lot of other tubes and monitors on her. Things weren\u2019t great from the start, the next day they got a bit better, then that evening they got worse. Around 2am we got results back that showed she wasn\u2019t responding to any treatments, and we were told she was on fentanyl for pain. My husband and I decided to end her suffering, and held her in our arms as she passed that morning, June 20th. \n\nObviously this has been absolutely devastating. I\u2019m recovering from a c section and my baby is gone, and it really, really sucks. People from the insurance company and my short term disability company, the hospital security guard, the pharmacist, and others have told us \u2018congratulations \u2018 and it\u2019s just fucked up. \n\nHydrops is just a symptom, not a disease itself, do we don\u2019t know what caused it yet. We\u2019re waiting for autopsy results, but a good portion of the time they don\u2019t find out the cause. Everything was fine up through my 28 week appointment, and I\u2019m under 30 and was otherwise healthy and low risk. \n\nRight now, I just want to find that new normal, and get back to a functional life. I want a baby so badly, hormones are telling me \u2018get pregnant\u2019, but it sounds like it\u2019ll be a while before my body is healed enough for a safe pregnancy, and we\u2019re emotionally ready to try again.

I am currently waiting to start ttc again after a 10w5d loss. Back in February, I had a CP then found out I was pregnant 2 cycles later. MDW I was experiencing some pretty bad back pain but I also have sciatica that sometimes acts up and that\u2019s what I assumed was happening. I rested that weekend and was back to normal for the week. Then the following Monday, June 2nd, I began experiencing heavy, bright bleeding. I went to the doctor that day and they were able to squeeze me in for an ultrasound after a preliminary checkup and told me they couldn\u2019t find a heart beat. I had a D&amp;E scheduled for that Friday but had passed a lot of tissue and the sac by the next day so never had the D&amp;E. I stopped bleeding about 1.5 weeks later and here we are now a few weeks later. I haven\u2019t had a full cycle yet.\n\nQuestion: on a HPT is a darkening line indicative of increasing HCG or just that there still is HCG? I took a test on 7/2 with a very faint line, then on 7/4 and again 7/5 with both of those increasingly darker.
