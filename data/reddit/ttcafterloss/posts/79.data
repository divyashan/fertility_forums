I just had my second 2nd trimester loss back in February. My sister is due at the end of September and I would\u2019ve been due at the end of this month. Her shower will be the week of my due date. \n\nI have had very little contact with her since she announced her pregnancy shortly after my most recent loss. It\u2019s just so hard, especially since my SIL (on my husband\u2019s side) was pregnant along with me last year at the time of my first loss so I already have a niece who is a month younger than the first baby I lost would\u2019ve been. I\u2019m super happy for my sister but it\u2019s just super crappy timing for me. It\u2019s been hard being around my SIL\u2019s baby a lot of the time and now I\u2019ll have another niece or nephew that\u2019s also a reminder of my other lost baby. (I don\u2019t even know what the gender of my sister\u2019s baby is yet).\n\nSo for my question: sitting through a baby shower right now is honestly the last thing on this planet that I want to do right now. I just don\u2019t think I could do it. However, I don\u2019t want to regret missing my little sister\u2019s baby shower for her first baby. I am very fortunate and grateful to have an LC so I regret and feel bad already that I haven\u2019t been there for her to answer questions and support her during her pregnancy. If it was for anyone other than my sister, I would absolutely skip it in a heartbeat. But I don\u2019t want to regret not going. I feel like I\u2019m damned if I do, damned if I don\u2019t here. She lives out of state so I only see her a few times a year at most. She is traveling back home for the shower. Right now I\u2019m leaning towards skipping the shower, sending her a nice gift and meeting up with her privately to visit while she\u2019s here.

At the time I was so distraught/distracted that I didn't really give it much thought. But since my pregnancy loss, I've had intermittent pain on my lower left side. At times (such as around my period/ovulation) the pain is quite sharp and intense. I went back to my doctors today for an ultrasound because the pain had been really worrying me and I didn't know if the cyst could be causing problems with getting pregnant again. \n\nAfter an ultrasound and a long wait, the doctor basically told me the cyst is still there but otherwise everything looks fine and to just give it time. I'm not sure what I was expecting but I just feel like my concerns were dismissed. Aren't cysts not supposed to hurt? \n\nWould be curious to know if anyone else has had one that was painful.

After trying off and on since 9/16, we got pregnant in June 2018 (I found out on July 2), but we lost the baby at 8 weeks. Even with this loss, I wasn\u2019t feeling LOW LOW. Just like a sadness, and a blow. But, I was optimistic about us conceiving again because the midwife who checked me out, and OB/GYN who helped me through the miscarriage were optimistic. Plus, I was happy to realize my body could actually conceive.\n\nMonths went by. Ovulation and periods, no conception. When the baby\u2019s due date approached, I started to feel some old depression/anxiety symptoms come back: avoidance, difficulty sleeping/terribly critical inner voice and negativity, stress. Plus, the due date really started to make me sad: my baby would\u2019ve been born by now, I thought. \n\nSo, suggested by my OB, and at the urging of my best friend (who conceived via IUI after a year of fertility treatments) and my sister (a lesbian paying out of pocket on her sixth failed IUI), I contacted a fertility specialist. \n\nI can\u2019t begin to explain the dread of this. I 99% chalk it up to my anxiety and negativity, but... the specialist made me feel so old, fat, and terrible. She explained that they wouldn\u2019t want to start treatments on someone of my weight, but that we would need to start soon because of my age. She questioned me about why I would get a D&amp;C (because it was offered to me when I was afraid and in a lot of physical pain?) and had a few lines of questioning overall that made me feel small and negative and kind of like a piece of shit. I just nodded and scheduled all the tests, gave my blood, and thanked everyone. But... When I got in the elevator to leave, I just broke down. Crying. And couldn\u2019t stop, and walked out of the building and kept walking, past the parking lot, just walking and walking blindly, and having the worst anxiety I\u2019ve ever had since I stopped the meds. \n\nI\u2019ve given more blood, had genetic testing, a fluoroscopy, my husbands given his tests, things LOOK normal, still ovulating... not conceiving. Specialist wanted me to see a nutritionist, and referred me offsite to some place I\u2019m not familiar with; they contacted me. I wasn\u2019t okay with that because I don\u2019t drive, it was kind of far away, so i contacted my own pcp instead for a referral because these specialist bills are already racking up. But, I\u2019m really scared to go back. I\u2019m mid-30s and need to drop 60 pounds stat, and I\u2019m afraid to go back because weight has always been an issue for me since childhood, and I know it\u2019s scary, but I keep thinking about how I did conceive that one time and I feel so terrible going back to that doctor still fat and old and just the feelings of hopelessness in that office...compared to the feelings of hope every time we try conceiving in our own. I think it might be in my head, but I have bad vibes like this doctor is annoyed by my fat ass just being there.\n\nYou know I want a baby, we all want a baby. But, I\u2019m just so freaked out about the fertility specialists and all the appointments (in my first two weeks, I had 4 appointments), the atmosphere of hopelessness, that I mentally shut down. I haven\u2019t been in 2 cycles. I keep thinking it can happen again, like before... I just need someone to talk me down.

Miscarriage\n\n6 years ago I was 23 and living in NYC. A thousand miles away from family or anything familiar. I wanted love. I searched for love. Love I never received at home, in the way I wanted it. I  looked for it and gave it to people that had no business receiving it. Long story short, I met a guy who was no good for me. I knew it from the start. But he said he loved me. No man has EVER said they loved me until that point. (My dad was never vocal about his feelings.) \n\nArguments turned from yelling, to pushing, to hitting, to locking myself in the room and him tearing the door down. He told me he\u2019s sorry afterwards and that he loves me. I believed him. \n2 months later I find I\u2019m pregnant. I take 5 pregnancy tests to make sure. They\u2019re all positive. I have $18 to my name. It\u2019s 10 degrees and snowing outside. I take the train and the bus to get to him to tell him so we can figure something out. I now have $13 to my name. \n\nI get to his house.. I\u2019m scared and excited at the same time. Maybe this will mean things will turn for the better between us. Everything was a blur. I remember trying to get up from the bottom of the cement steps outside. I was in shock. It was hard to catch my breath as literally the wind was knocked out of me.

I told them I slipped on ice and fell down the stairs.\n\n5 hours later.. an ultrasound, a CT, and a pill. I was no longer pregnant.

It was a mortifying experience and led me to feel like trying again would not be worth risking going through this utter heartbreak again. In a way I feel lucky that it wasn't a later MC because I don't know how I could've been even remotely salvageable after it. Even at early in the process, I felt like my heart was being ripped out of my chest. \n\nNow, a few weeks later, I feel like trying again and oddly I feel completely displaced from that whole experience. Like it didn't even happen. Logically I know it did, and logically I'm terrified of another MC. But emotionally, I now feel like that never even happened. Like a weird nightmarish dream almost. \n\nIdk why I'm telling you this, maybe to just get it out. I never really told anybody about the pregnancy or loss.

I got a positive test today (my HCG was 5 3 weeks ago when I miscarried, so although it is a very early BFP, I know it is accurate, plus I always feel my symptoms RIGHT AWAY and have known for at least a week now myself). Anyhow, I'm not happy (bc I'm just waiting for it to fail), I'm more... relieved. Same feeling I always get when I'm pregnant. I had 3 CPs in 2018, a 16 week loss in May, a 6 week natural miscarriage immediately after, and now this pregnancy. I can't see a specialist until I've had 3 losses, and doctors aren't/won't count the 3 CPs from last year (they say that can be common the first yr after discontinuing birth control). I am using 40 mg progesterone cream 2x a day because that is all I can think to do. Whatever. When I lose a baby, although I always have miserable pregnancies (seriously every symptom), I am SO RELIEVED to be pregnant again. My body misses it and it gives me hope again. But I've been pregnant for like a year and a half straight now and I am sooooo sick of being pregnant all the time with no baby. My husband is sick of it, too, because I am a laaaame pregnant person. I just lay around and do nothing. Pregnancy exhausts me and I have NO DESIRE to socialize or do anything fun when pregnant. I've lost my entire social life. On top of it, I have NOOO memory (serious preg brain!) and no care in the world aside from my symptoms, so I forget to text people back etc.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy husband never wants me to tell people until 12 weeks, so I've gotten to tell family ONCE (16 week loss). I hate having to lie and hide all the time. In social situations (which I DESPISE ANYWAY when pregnant, although very social in normal life), I feel like a fraud and never have any fun. I feel like shit and talking to people exhausts me, plus I have nothing interesting to contribute (oh... nothing much new... just counting dead babies...)  I'd rather hide myself away and become a person again once a baby was born. If a month went by where I didn't end up getting pregnant, I would enjoy myself, however I seem to get pregnant every single time. My husband is sick of me being a couch potato (but when pregnant im SOOO tired and SOOOO uncomfortable that I don't really care), and I'm sick of hiding from everyone. I stopped texting with my closest friends about it because I don't feel like always dragging everyone down with me. So, I figure I won't tell again until I've heard a heartbeat, BUT IM SO FREAKIN LONELY! What do you guys do about this? I feel left out because I'm struggling with this alone, my husband is tired of the way I \"act\" when pregnant and wants to have fun (\"let's just see what happens\"... except we fall pregnant EVERY TIME)... blah. I am so alone and lonely.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf it were up to me, I wouldn't need a break (and haven't been getting one anyway), but my husband wouldn't make me feel guilty for being/\"acting\" pregnant, and I would just be honest with people. I'm not sure how to get out of socializing completely though... I really do hate it other than my closest friends and family. The rest I wouldn't mind seeing until after I have a baby lol. I wish I could just be open and honest and people would act normal about it. I wish others didn't pity me. I wish I could tell my family. I wish it didn't concern people so much.

We were to find out the gender of my first child, Xeno (jokingly nicknamed after the Xenomorphs from Alien). They were to be the first grand baby of my family and, while I had not planned them, I was so utterly in love with them.  We made an event of it, my S/O and myself going to the clinic; my parents driving in two hours to join us to see the reveal of their grandbaby. We were going to find out then go out to have lunch and celebrate before finally starting out shopping....\n\nAs the lab tech worked on the ultrasound, I noticed something was wrong. Xeno wasn't moving, and I couldn't hear or see a heart. She kept asking me to move, reposition myself, and empty my bladder... But I knew already what it was. I asked her over and over where the heart was, but she would never answer me, instead walking out, leaving my family and myself in silence. As my OBGYN came into the room, I knew what it was-- my Xeno had died. No warnings, no notice, just a silent fetal demise. \n\nI gave birth to them on February 15th at 11:30 PM. 23 weeks. 8 inches long.  A mere 145 grams.  Something was very wrong, but we weren't able to find out what. We weren't told a gender, and I wasn't able to hold them.\n\nAs August approaches, I'm going to try again. As a teacher, I have to time it for an August pregnancy so that the baby will be born during the summer-- FMLA had wiped me out from losing Xeno and having to take time off. I'm still dealing with the repercussions of being docked over 1,000 dollars a month. \n\nI'm not going to lie.... I am terrified, and I don't know how to handle it. I am so scared to go through the journey for a second time only to lose again. I had actually considered waiting until I was 20 weeks to tell anyone, but I realized quickly that I would be cutting off my support system if I did.\n\nI never knew how desperately I wanted a child until they were taken away from me... I know I want to try-- that I will try in August-- but the thought of having to go through all that again... Finally telling my family, friends, my students, and my coworkers.. Only to lose it all and then, in a way, be punished for not being able to work afterwards.  I couldn't function for weeks after losing them. My support system was amazing, but..

It's my first pregnancy, and we have been trying for almost a year.  It hit us hard.  We also found out the same day we had to put our four year old puppy down - he has been fighting in a veterinarian clinic for the past 6 weeks after slipping a disc and being paralyzed.  He was my love, and to lose them both in the same day, really, truly within the same hour is just... it's so heavy.  It's so much loss and I'm having trouble processing/dealing.  \n\nI like to be open and honest with my close circle of friends, and one of my friends had such a shocking response that I honestly don't/didn't know how to respond.  She said, \"miscarriages are very common, especially for us who are getting pregnant in our 30's... you were also dealing with a lot of emotional stress at the same time which puts a toll on the body.\" ... WTF? Honestly?  Is she blaming my dead dog for my miscarriage? Also, she is NOT trying to have a baby - she is living with her bf but they are still trying to figure out marriage timing (he seems a bit resistant to the idea) and nowhere NEAR getting ready to try.  How would you handle a friend like this?  Should I tell her how insensitive her comments are?  Ignore it for now and re-vist in a few weeks?  I know that she is not really aware of what this means - the life you plan for your baby, the invasive vaginal ultrasounds to dig around to make sure your uterus is empty and you aren't having an ectopic pregnancy, the blood draws every few days just to dig in the knife that your baby has stopped growing... I know I sound melodramatic.  Or maybe I don't.  I'm so knew to this, and it's so sad and heavy, and I was hoping my friends would be angry and upset with me, and not give me a lecture on how MCs work (and she's wrong, btw so that makes it even worse).", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "ttcafterloss", "subreddit_id": "t5_34scd", "subreddit_subscribers": 5711, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Have any of you have horrible responses to a MC from 'friends'?", "total_awards_received": 0, "updated_utc": 1562996711, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/ttcafterloss/comments/cc6tu0/have_any_of_you_have_horrible_responses_to_a_mc/"}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "galadrielirl", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_40l5bujo", "author_patreon_flair": false, "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1562914403, "domain": "self.ttcafterloss", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/ttcafterloss/comments/cc7ezr/possible_chemical_pregnancy_venting/", "gildings": {}, "id": "cc7ezr", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 4, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/ttcafterloss/comments/cc7ezr/possible_chemical_pregnancy_venting/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1562914404, "score": 5, "selftext": "Long post...just need to vent . Missed miscarriage in Feb 2019.. baby was 9 weeks  I was 13 weeks. Did misoprostol, no complications... super devastating. It was a surprise pregnancy that we were quite excited about. Fast forward to now... we've been careful the last few months as I haven't been feeling ready to try yet. Stressful work situation currently and a lot of unknowns in the next few months but I finally felt like 'fuck it' what are we waiting  for ya know? There is no perfect time. So we had lot of sex just before I think I ovulated... really just having fun, not necessarily trying per se. Then me being an impatient idiot took a test a few days before my period just to see. Got a super faint positive. And another super faint positive a little while later. Went out and got clear blue. Verrrrry faint positive. Got a little excited. Told my husband. Had a negative the following afternoon (still hadn't actually 'missed' my period - dumb right?) Then a reaallyy faint positive the next morning. Followed by a negative yesterday afternoon.... then I got my period last night (technically 1 day late which isn't unusual for me). So then the onset of the fear and anxiety. Was it a chemical pregnancy?? Is it possible to have evap lines on multiple pregnancy tests of dofferent brands? It seems unlikely. Does that mean that things went wrong again? Is there something wrong with us? Is this considered a second miscarriage? My period is pretty normal so far and I feel fine (physically) overall ... but having waves of anxiety and worrying this will be our pattern of disappointment. I feel like a fool for checking so early. I wish I hadn't. I wish I hadn't gotten our hopes up. Just wish it wasn't our lot in life to deal with worries like this. I don't want to be that person that worries about everything. I want that feeling we had the first time of thrill and joy. I knew something was wrong the first time around, but still felt excited and tried to push the worries to the back of my mind... but now what if all of my fears are accurate.

What would you do if you had two months waiting to try again?", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "ttcafterloss", "subreddit_id": "t5_34scd", "subreddit_subscribers": 5712, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Waiting to try again", "total_awards_received": 0, "updated_utc": 1563134506, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/ttcafterloss/comments/cctqrr/waiting_to_try_again/"}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "Kinglens311", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_khlt4", "author_patreon_flair": false, "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1563048554, "domain": "reddit.com", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/ttcafterloss/comments/ccttvh/waiting_to_try_again/", "gildings": {}, "id": "ccttvh", "is_crosspostable": false, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": false, "is_self": false, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 0, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/ttcafterloss/comments/ccttvh/waiting_to_try_again/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1563048555, "score": 1, "selftext": "", "send_replies": false, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "ttcafterloss", "subreddit_id": "t5_34scd", "subreddit_subscribers": 5712, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "default", "title": "Waiting to try again", "total_awards_received": 0, "updated_utc": 1563134939, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/ttcafterloss/comments/cctqrr/waiting_to_try_again/?utm_source=ifttt"}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "Rhoda__Penmark", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_3438uqrg", "author_patreon_flair": false, "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1563056343, "domain": "self.ttcafterloss", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/ttcafterloss/comments/ccvauw/i_dont_even_know_how_to_title_this_not_pregnant/", "gildings": {}, "id": "ccvauw", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 14, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/ttcafterloss/comments/ccvauw/i_dont_even_know_how_to_title_this_not_pregnant/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1563056344, "score": 18, "selftext": "I had my miscarriage in April, so we haven't been ttc again for very long, just a few months.

I am so sad that anyone is here, but from what I've read so far it seems to be a space full of compassion and thoughtful advice and that's so appreciated.\n\nA bit about me: I'm 34 and have been TTC with my husband (40) since 2017. We had two losses in 2017, a single pregnancy at 6 weeks in August, and a twin pregnancy at 6.5 weeks in December. We decided to take some time from trying but lost again in November 2018 at 6.5 weeks, not confirmed until 8 wks. I've been seeing an RE since December 2018, with RPL panel providing no answers (aside from slightly elevated TSH for pregnancy), and a potential minor uterine septum, which was resected in February. We've been trying naturally since the procedure with no luck. \n\nI'm writing today because the last two years have taken a toll on us (we've also both lost our fathers in this time so it has only added to the grief and anxiety), and while we have generally always been able to communicate pretty easily and manage conflict in a healthy way, I'm finding that TTC is really starting to put a strain on our relationship. We've realized we're arguing more in our daily lives, and found the actual fertile window to be complete hell. We've discussed couples counseling, and are actively searching for someone in our area, but I thought I'd reach out for advice on other things we could try in our daily lives, and during fertile window, to alleviate some of the stress/anxiety until we can get in. Any advice would be greatly appreciated.
