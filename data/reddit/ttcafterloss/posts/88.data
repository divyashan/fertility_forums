Here goes...\n\nIn September 2018 I had a TFMR at 21 weeks pregnant. It was my first pregnancy and my baby boy had significant defects in his brain, heart, spine, and kidneys which made him 'incompatible with life'. It was the hardest thing I have ever experienced. Since then I've had multiple chemical pregnancies that miscarried at 4-5 weeks so not nearly as heartbreaking, but still takes its emotional toll. \n\nEven though it's been over a year, I still struggle with the loss. When I first was grieving, I wrote baby boy a lullaby, sung to a familiar tune but I changed all the words to reflect the hopes and dreams I had for him, and the life I wished I could give him. That helped me to process my emotions and essentially say goodbye. But now I feel like it's been too long for me to still feel heartbroken, and singing to nothing seems silly now. It's making TTC (or even thinking about TTC) hard too.. Too many mixed emotions. My SO doesn't seem phased at all. It never affected him like it did me (he never felt him kick or carried him around though so I guess I understand why it's not as traumatic for him). \n\nI want to know.... what have you tried to cope with the loss and find closure? Has anyone else wrote a lullaby?

I took misoprostol to start the miscarriage, and long story short, it seems this didn't actually work but it took a long time to get the hospital to take me seriously and so it was 14 weeks after the miscarriage I ended up having a hysteroscopy to remove the remaining pregnancy tissue.

The last 3 periods have also been weird, I've been having really dark brown spotting leading up to my period, usually for several days.

All I know right now is the fetus\u2019s genetic testing was normal, all my basic testing (thyroid, INR, etc.) was normal, and the physical pathology on the fetus and placenta were normal (ie, visually normal it\u2019s gestational age, etc). My diagnosis from when we started this process in 1/2019 was \u201cunexplained infertility.\u201d\n\nI\u2019ve already met with my OB for my post-op follow up which covered my physical recovery, a referral back to my RE and to an RPL pathologist. I\u2019ve already been given info on the earliest to try again (10 weeks post loss due to the D&amp;C and hemorrhage). \n\nWhat questions should I come to my RE prepared with? We already know we\u2019re back on track to IVF, since that\u2019s where we were before I got pregnant.

To be honest, I'm not feeling as excited as I was the first time, but I'm still feeling pretty good and, most importantly, confident! We're only about 4-5 weeks in, and I'm a little nervous about calling my doctor back for a new \"first prenatal visit\". There are definitely some specific things I would like to happen this time around...\n\nFirst, there is a nurse that works at the clinic I went to that is awful at taking blood. She would never get it on the first try, always blew out my vein, and would blame it on ME for not drinking enough water. I drink plenty of water!! I want to make it very clear to them that I do NOT want to be seen by this nurse! Any tips on how I can communicate this without being a pain in the ass? There's another nurse who was always pleasant to work with, and was very gentle and considerate. I want to see her more if possible!\n\nSecond, they have a policy where they only do one ultrasound throughout the entire pregnancy about halfway through, unless there are \"complications\". At the very least, I want to hear the heartbeat at my 8 week visit, for peace of mind. Has anyone else requested an early ultrasound before? If so, how'd it go?\n\nLast year was my first time ever going to prenatal visits, so I pretty much did whatever they asked/said. I know how things work now, so I'm more prepared! I just don't want to be too needy, but I also don't want to go through any unnecessary stress (ie that unpleasant nurse).

I got my period/cycle back the following month and my husband and I conceived on 10/3.  We saw our little bean and flickering heartbeat via ultrasound at 7w3d.  At 10w1d we went in for another ultrasound and learned that our bean had stopped growing at 8w1d.  We scheduled a D&amp;C for the following day - 11/26 (happy Thanksgiving to us).

I still have not had a period (7 weeks post D&amp;C) which according to my doctor is bordering on a long time.  She wants me to give it another week and if I still don't have it to come in.  This weekend I decided to take a OPK to see if maybe I was ovulating that perhaps I could predict when my period would come - I know this is wishful thinking :).  For the fun of it I threw in a pregnancy test as well.  Both the OPK and the pregnancy test were positive.  I read that this could happen as OPK tests don't differentiate between HCG and LH.  Sunday morning I took another pregnancy test and again it was a VERY clear positive.  Same with this morning.

We had a timed intercourse after the ovidrel shot. I also didn't take any progesterone. On Dec 16 (4.5weeks) I went into clinic for blood test and it came positive at 12hcg.\nI had some bleeding during this week which I presumed was miscarriage. \n 4 days later (Dec 20) it was only at 24hcg and they declared it as a loss and said it's chemical pregnancy. \nA week later on Dec 27 (6 weeks) the beta went up to 30.45 and they said it's abnormal and to go to ultrasound right away. Ultrasound didn't show anyything but they didn't rule out ectopic pregnancy which was what it was for. I didn't experience any pain that week. \nOn Dec 30 my beta went down to 23.24\nJan 3 (7 weeks) beta went down again to 21.06 and they said they were hopeful it's going to get to 0 soon. \nJan 8 (8 weeks) beta suddenly goes up to 57.95. The nurses tell me to go to ER right away as the beta is abnormal and they want to make sure it's not ectopic pregnancy. My husband took a day off and we went to the ER in the hospital. The doctor there said that my beta is low so ultrasound won't help as it won't see anything and that ectopic pregnancy usually happens when numbers are over 1500. So he basically said we wasted time coming there. He said to have the betas checked again next week. \n\nThe next day my husband and I had an appointment with the fertility doctor and he said that my pregnancy is definitely not viable and that I will have to go to an early loss clinic next week to have them look at it. He also said that my betas have to be checked next Monday before going to the early loss clinic. Most likely I will have to take a pill to end the pregnancy. \n\nToday - Jan 13 I went to fertility clinic for blood work and I am waiting to hear back from them about my beta. I haven't had any blood or pain. \n\nHas anyone had such low and fluctuating betas in their 5-8 weeks? Did they confirm what kind of pregnancy loss was it?

TL;DR: 5 years, IVF, fresh transfer, MMC\n\nAfter 5 long years of TTC, we finally did an IVF cycle in October last year. I have diminished ovarian reserve, so I was a poor responder to stimulation and it looked like the cycle would be cancelled at one point. Somehow, we got 5 mature eggs at retrieval and with a serious stroke of good luck, 4 of those made it to the blastocyst stage (5 days). We transferred one at 5 days after my retrieval. It took. For the first time in 5 years, I was actually pregnant. Betas were a tad slow to rise, but did double (everyone said, \"it's okay! That's normal!\"). At 7+3, I had a scan at the fertility clinic. Heartbeat was 129, but embryo measured 5 days behind (\"things look good, but not perfect\"). Was supposed to go back at 9+3. Clinic called to cancel my scan and send me for one where I live instead (clinic is a 3 hour drive from me). Went to my GP and a maternity doctor, who both gushed about me being so young and healthy and it was SO unlikely that anything could go wrong. The maternity doctor used an in-office ultrasound and \"saw\" a flicker - \"it's definitely a heartbeat!\" And besides, the clinic wouldn't have 'graduated' you if things weren't going well, right? An urgent request was sent for an ultrasound appointment, note on the request was \"patient anxious\". Christmas Eve. 10+4. No heartbeat. Stopped growing at 8+1. Would have definitely found this out at the canceled scan on December 16. It definitely did NOT have a heartbeat at the maternity doctor's office. Merry fucking Christmas. Took misoprostol on December 30 and miscarried after one dose, 6 hours after I took it. Worst experience of my life, hands down. The hormone crash was something that I can't even describe. Such a dark, hopeless hole. \n\nNow I'm waiting on my period to show so that I can prep for another transfer. I desperately want to be pregnant again, but I am also terrified of this happening again. At least now I know to advocate for myself and fight when I know things aren't right. Positive thinking and being hopeful solves absolutely nothing in this situation.

I know she most likely isn\u2019t avoiding me.\n\nI feel like I\u2019m stuck in limbo. I still haven\u2019t had a period. I thought I was having ovulation symptoms a few weeks ago so timed sex, but all my pregnancy tests are negative. I would feel relief in bleeding at this point. \n\nAnd my brother just FaceTimed me to show me his second daughter, born this morning. And I\u2019m so happy for them, because they\u2019ve had two losses out of four pregnancies. \n\nBut I am so, so utterly sad for me. \n\nWhen the hell does this start to feel better?", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "steward_reports": [], "stickied": false, "subreddit": "ttcafterloss", "subreddit_id": "t5_34scd", "subreddit_subscribers": 6690, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Grief isn\u2019t linear.", "total_awards_received": 0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/ttcafterloss/comments/ep1q9f/grief_isnt_linear/"}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "hungrycaterpillarpop", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_23xg491l", "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_premium": false, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1579095121, "domain": "self.ttcafterloss", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/ttcafterloss/comments/ep2dj6/headed_into_2nd_chemical_back_to_back_please_any/", "gildings": {}, "id": "ep2dj6", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 16, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/ttcafterloss/comments/ep2dj6/headed_into_2nd_chemical_back_to_back_please_any/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1579095122, "score": 1, "selftext": "Hi.

Today I just feel so defeated.\n\n A little back story: we had a surprise pregnancy back in May. My daughter was only a year and a half old and having major mood swings, our house was on the market (so I was packing, cleaning like crazy, and hauling my daughter and 111lb German Shepherd out of the house multiple times a day for showings). I was a stressed out disaster, and a pregnancy was the last thing I wanted at that moment. \n\nI ended up miscarrying at 7/8 weeks. I know everyone says it\u2019s because of genetic issues, but I can\u2019t help but feel like I caused it because I did NOT slow down during this time, because I honestly couldn\u2019t. We had been to the doctor prior and saw the baby and a cardiac flicker, and there wasn\u2019t much my O.B. said that would make me think I would lose the baby, other than I was measuring a week and a half behind (I did this with my daughter as well.. she\u2019s in the 1% for weight). But when I went in to confirm the miscarriage, I saw a different doctor from mine (I swear, she\u2019s never in office) and that doctor basically treated me like I should have expected it to happen. Idk what my doctor put in the computer about it being a non-viable pregnancy, but that was not communicated to us. All I know is as soon as I lost that baby, I wanted another. Immediately. \n\nSo here I am, just wanting my period to start, so I can head in to month 8 of ttc. I just feel so incredibly lost. I\u2019m a 5\u20199, 134lb female - 19.5% BMI. I exercise 3x a week, 2 running miles and 30-50 minutes of core/weights. Ok. So I\u2019m not over weight or under weight... so that shouldn\u2019t be the issue. I weigh 15lbs less than when I conceived my daughter, and 9 lbs more than when I conceived my 2nd, so if my mom tells me one more time, \u2018maybe you should temporarily gain weight to get pregnant\u2019, I think my brain might explode. Is that even a thing? If I\u2019m having periods, could exercise be affecting my ability to get pregnant?\n\nThis next cycle I\u2019m cutting all dairy, gluten, and alcohol, because that\u2019s the only thing I haven\u2019t done (ate all of that when I conceived the previous two). I\u2019m literally just about to try everything. \n\nI just feel like this is my fault. I feel like I was mad I was pregnant, and then when I was ok with it, I miscarried. I don\u2019t get why God would put me through an unplanned pregnancy, allow me to lose it, and then not allow me to get pregnant. How did I go from 2 babies conceived literally the first try and on accident, to nothing? To top it off, my OB refuses to do any testing further than blood work, until I\u2019ve been trying for over a year. She says \u2018you\u2019ve been pregnant before, I don\u2019t see why you can\u2019t do it again\u2019. I\u2019ve ended up speaking to multiple O.B.\u2019s at kaiser (because mine is never in office - the 3 times I\u2019ve emailed her, another o.b. has responded, and mine doesn\u2019t answer for 3 weeks) I don\u2019t think I can emotionally handle this, if I\u2019m doing this for a year. \n\nI also just want to add, I\u2019m not obnoxiously emailing her. I emailed her twice during the miscarriage (to ask if bleeding was normal, and then to confirm everything was passed - she was out of office so I dealt with two different o.b.s then). I emailed her 6 months after and asked for blood work, because my skin was horribly broken out after the miscarriage. Then I couldn\u2019t get ahold of her for two weeks for the results, and other o.b.s responded for her. Then in December I had a chemical, and asked if I should have my levels tested again, as maybe something is causing the miscarriages, and another doctor responded and told me basically, we won\u2019t do anything until you\u2019ve been trying for a year - still haven\u2019t heard from my assigned o.b.\n\n\nI just feel so dismissed. don\u2019t get why doctors refuse to listen to you. I think I know my body better than any of you, so if y\u2019all could stop for 5 damn seconds to listen, that would be GREAT. \nI\u2019m just over this.", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "steward_reports": [], "stickied": false, "subreddit": "ttcafterloss", "subreddit_id": "t5_34scd", "subreddit_subscribers": 6698, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Peed on a stick today.

OB ignored my request to do bloodwork, second OB told me \\*maybe\\* I'm newly pregnant or \\*maybe\\* the gestational sac from MMC never passed. Feeling very distraught.\n\nI had a missed miscarriage in late December and found out on 12/18. On 12/21 I took an 800mg dose of Misoprostol to pass the fetal tissue and I bled pretty heavily for 1.5 days and passed a couple of clots. I had a followup appointment on 12/27 and the OB asked me if I was still bleeding and how long I bled for. I answered her questions and she said that I could start TTC again ASAP and that some women start to ovulate pretty quickly after miscarriages and some don't but that there's no reason to wait to TTC. Great, I thought, because I want to be pregnant. She said I didn't need to wait until I'd had another menstrual cycle to TTC and that if I did get pregnant right away, they would just use my miscarriage date on 12/21 as they would use the date of my last period. It sounded somewhat normal to me, but I had never had a miscarriage before so I honestly didn't know any better. \n\nI thought I ovulated last Tuesday (1/7) and was ready to take a test the next Friday (1/17) when my period was \"due\" (assuming I went back to my usual cycle...which may have been naive but like I said, I've never gone through this before and only know what my body has done before).  But then I had this fear that I\u2019d take a pregnancy test on Friday and get a positive but that it\u2019d be a false positive because my body still \\*thinks\\* it\u2019s pregnant. \n\nSo I took on Sunday 1/12 to make sure I got a negative so that if I got a positive on Friday I\u2019d know it was real...but my test on Sunday was positive. And it\u2019s \\*possible\\* maybe that it\u2019s a real positive but I think it\u2019s more likely that my body just still has higher levels of HCG and I\u2019m not pregnant or ovulating yet.  So I decided to call my OB on Monday to get it figured out. In the meantime, I learn via online forums that it's pretty typical for OB's to do blood panels to determine HCG levels after a miscarriage as well as to perform ultrasounds to determine if there's any tissue left over. \n\nOn Monday 1/13, I called the OB and asked when I could come in for bloodwork/ultrasound. They told me that it\u2019s not a standard appointment so they\u2019d have to have someone call me back. I didn't hear anything back in several hours so I called again and the receptionist said that it can take up to 24-48 hours to respond to patient questions and that I need to wait for the OB to call me back\u2026ok, so I waited until the next afternoon and still hadn't heard anything. So I called again. They said they wouldn't make an appointment with me until I am 8 weeks along so I explained that I had a recent miscarriage and wanted to find out if my pregnancy test meant anything or not and the receptionist acted like this has literally never happened and said she\u2019d leave a message with an OB to see if they could make an exception for the typical blood draw given my individual circumstances...I explained that I had already done this the day before. She says I will have to wait for an OB to call me back. Several hours later I hear back from the OB and she says \"wait for a week and take another pregnancy test and if it's still positive, call back and we'll go from there\". That's it.\n\nMeanwhile, I feel like I'm going crazy at this point because I had been feeling nauseous for a few days and it was messing with my head like  \u201cam I feeling sick because I am pregnant or because I am so stressed about whether or not I am pregnant??\u201d\n\nI was stressing out to my husband about it and he suggested I try a different OB. I call an OB that I used to go to (I only changed practices because it was a little far of a drive and I wanted to switch to a place closer to me). So, I called that OB yesterday after the \"wait a week\" from the original OB to see if they\u2019d approach my situation any differently.\n\nThey told me to come in for an ultrasound and bloodwork ASAP. I went in this morning and they did an ultrasound to see if there was any leftover tissue in my uterus that might be causing a false positive or to check if I actually am pregnant again. In the ultrasound, there was a very clear gestational sac measuring exactly the same as our miscarried fetus. Shocking, to say the least since I took Misoprostol to pass all of the fetal tissue and I bled pretty heavily for a day and a half. Obviously my mind is racing at this point and when the OB looked at the ultrasound she said \u201cmy gut is that this gestational sac is leftover from your previous pregnancy BUT it\u2019s entirely possible that you are newly pregnant and that you conceived almost immediately after your miscarriage. Very uncommon but it happens. So even though my gut tells me that this is old fetal tissue, I can\u2019t get you set up with options to remove it until we know for sure whether this is a new pregnancy or not.\u201d\n\nI\u2019m going back to that OB in a week and a half to do another ultrasound and to get more bloodwork done to see if there\u2019s any progress or if everything is stagnant. Then we\u2019ll know what steps we should take moving forward.\n\nIn the meantime, I am such an emotional wreck. I am feeling angry that I have gotten a bunch of positive pregnancy tests this week and that I can't celebrate them because of our loss. I am confused because I don't know if I am newly pregnant or if my body is STILL holding onto the previous pregnancy's gestational sac, despite taking Misoprostol (of course I have now learned that it doesn't always work). I am especially angry with my original OB and how it seems like they did the bare minimum to make sure that my body had properly processed the miscarriage. I don't know why I am writing this all out here...I just needed somewhere to process with other people who might understand.

I had my first D&amp;C November 12 last year- my doctor told me that, after the initial bleeding from the procedure, a few weeks would past and then I should get a period. After that first period I can start TTC.\n\nWell after D&amp;C bleeding (lasting about 14 days) and, 4 weeks after that, I had what I can barely even call a period. There was MILD brownish discharge for 2-3 days, not enough in total to fill the lightest of pads (my god... is this TMI?).\n\nAnyway after that first \"period\" I have been testing for ovulation and nothing- all the digital tests are negative. What i use gives you a blank face if no evidence, a blinking smiley if its detecting hormones and you are in a fertile window, and a non-blinking smiley if your 24-48 hours from ovulation. I have only had a blank and im near when I thought I was supposed to get my next period...\n\nSo yeah this is making me fucking mad- I am angry at my body.

What does your protocol look like?  Have you been successful?  Specifically - are you using intralipids, IVIg, prednisone, or lovenox or a combo?\n\nI realize the lovenox is a blood thinner and more used for APA/clotting disorders.

The nurse practitioner's reasoning was that if I tried to conceive too soon I could risk not having enough uterine lining. I can't remember her exact words but that was the gist.\n\nSo right now I am patiently awaiting AF. I bought an OPK and started using it about 8 days after the d&amp;c to get used to how it works and get in a routine because I did not do this before. I have also been temping every morning since the first of January. When I first started the opks they were reading high, and I was also getting a faint line on hcg tests. I googled and found out that the opks don't differentiate lh from hcg, so I guess I still had some pregnancy hormones in my system that were causing the opks to read high. Ok.\n\nFor the last few days opks have been low and pregnancy test this morning showed barely visible, like really have to squint hard to see it, line. \n\nSo, I'm glad that the pregnancy hormones seem to be going down because I really want to get my period and start trying again.\n\nI have read a lot of people have their HCG levels tested. I have never been told, ever, throughout this whole process, what my hormone levels were, and no one has tested them since the miscarriage. If they have, I don't know about it. Is that typical? It's never even been mentioned. I have no idea what my hormone levels actually are or how much hcg might be in my system still. I'm in the US if that makes a difference.  I'm just surprised at all the posts I read that include actual numbers and things that have been tested because I have never gotten any of that type of specific info.

And the thought of having to start all over again when I finally felt like I could have a break from the actual TTC part...it's just so freaking frustrating. And then, how am I supposed to survive future TWWs now that this has happened? It was a nightmare to begin with, but after this happening, getting another positive pregnancy test (assuming it happens again) won't make me happy, it will just make me terrified I'll lose it again. I thought about how that means I shouldn't test early next time, but honestly even if I'd waited till the day after my missed period this time, I STILL would have gotten a positive test! And I mean, even if I decided to stop testing all together, you can bet that any time I got my period late I'd assume it meant I had another CP. \n\nAnd I'm also obsessing over whether or not my friend who started TTC after I did will get pregnant this cycle; I *do* want her to get pregnant, and I hope when she does that she never ever experiences something like this...I just don't want her to get pregnant right *now,* immediately after I found out mine wasn't viable. I just don't know how to handle it if that happens.\n\nAnd then I hate that I'm even ranting about this at all...I know many of you on here have had losses much further into your pregnancies, and/or had multiple losses, yet here I am being this upset about a chemical pregnancy when I was barely 4 weeks along.

Before I had her take pregnancy test, after pregnancy test as I wanted to be sure that somehow this was the real deal. We had been trying at the time four years. And after all the shitty R.E.'s we went to, one finally had an answer. And it worked within our first session meeting him and it worked against all the odds.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe were supposed to do a trigger shot, IUI and other medications to hopefully increase our chances. But there were a few unexpected hiccups so we had to try monitoring and timing. At first my wife didn't think it would work, in fact she said it over and over again before crying herself to sleep afterwards. But I felt something different. And I was right. Rolling into week seven they said it was a bit smaller than usual, then she had bleeding but everything was fine. But going into nine is when it happened.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI was hurt, in fact I still am. But it wasn't about me at the time when it happened. My wife was experiencing a life growing inside of her and she told me she felt it go away. Meanwhile I trying to hold her together because she was going through a pain I could comprehend, but I couldn't understand. As the year went she found comfort with God and going to church and in fact she said she had a vision of a little girl telling her it was okay to move on. And to let go and that's what my wife has done. She now says things like, \"I've accepted the fact that it won't happen naturally,\" and that adoption may be our only route. And while adoption was always a part of the plan to begin with. I feel differently, because I never felt so much joy and panic than knowing a life was growing inside my wife.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI woke up this morning at exactly 2:59 a.m. and I never went back to sleep. I had a very realistic dream that her pregnancy continued and in fact she was starting to have labor pains. This dream was so realistic that we actually paid bills, went grocery shopping and I even was stuck in traffic. I literally lived months of my life, day by day with my wife. But waking up before I got to see that babies face has rattled me and I can't seem to shake the feeling. It's so strange to me to feel so strongly about a dream but I just wanted to see her face. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nDue to my wife's new job, stress and so much more it's been difficult to talk to her. I've mentioned it to her in passing but she doesn't seem interested. And I don't mean that in a fowl way like she doesn't care to listen to me. When I finally felt that it was a good time to talk to her I said to her, \"that dream I had really messed me up.\" And when I started to go into details, she interrupted me and said she was trying to finish watching her prerecorded Sunday church program that she missed. So I left the matter alone. It seems like I've missed my chance to talk to her about this because she's finally moved on. And now it seems like since it's now my turn to finally talk in order to let it go, I have no one to talk too. Which is why you're currently reading this. Like most men, including myself, I will just have to bottle it up and store it on the top shelf out of reach.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI would love to try again but she seems to always shoot down the idea by saying it won't work. I just wish to experience the joys of becoming the father I never had. In fact speaking of the father I never had the asshole is almost fifty years old and is \"excited\" about expecting twins from his 'side chick.' The man has never been in my life until this past year. He's narcissistic, greedy, a cheater, liar and so much more. And yet he's been given a blessing that he does not appreciate and for a man I barely know.
