The pregnancy that went the longest and started it all. We started trying for a baby in August 2016 last year and got our first positive pregnancy test in November. I was so happy in only took for cycles of trying. Everything was easier that pregnancy. I wasn't worried about everything, I was happy. Being pregnant obviously meant a baby was coming home. I mean I was highly aware miscarriages occurred because my sister had had two of them, but everything was going well and I didn't have any signs of anything bad happening. My dating scan was at 7 weeks and everything looked perfect. Then at 8 weeks I started bleeding. I was worried, but didn't have that bone deep fear that I have now. We went in for another scan to see if everything was alright and, amazingly, it was! Baby was perfect and wiggling around. We determined by bleeding was because of an infection. I took some antibiotics, the bleeding stopped, and everything was wonderful. I had two more scans that looked perfect, except for one small detail: every scan the baby was measuring further and further behind. I kept asking if it was fine, if I should be worried, but each nurse, ultrasound tech, and doctor told me it was fine and this often happens because the measurements are so hard to get accurately in those early weeks. So I believed them. Until my scan at 15+4 when I went in for a routine check up, haven't had any bleeding since week 10 and 2 other ultrasounds showed baby was fine. The doctor couldn't find the heart beat on the fetal Doppler, but this wasn't new for me or baby, the doctor had never been able to find the heartbeat with the fetal Doppler, which is why we always had to get the scan. So we moved back to ultrasound. And then there was my baby, looking kind of still, but I wasn't worried. I thought he was just sleeping. Until the tech left to get the doctor and then I know something wasn't right. I remember everything clear as day still, some 6 months later. She showed me how there was no flicker for the heartbeat. She showed me the brightly color scanning tool that is supposed to show blood flow and showed me how there wasn't any blood flow through the baby anymore. My poor baby was gray, while everything surrounding him was bright blue and red. Then she said those fucking horrible words, \"There is no heartbeat anymore.\" What. I don't understand how that is possible. I had 4 scans showing everything was fine, how could everything all of a sudden not be fine? How could my baby have died and I have not known it? How does this fucking happen at almost 16 weeks? I was in the magical second trimester when you were supposed to be in the clear from miscarriages and pregnancy was supposed to fun for three months. I was at the doctor's office by myself, I had to hear that news by myself. And then I had to call my husband who had just got off work and was waiting at home for me and tell him the most difficult thing I've ever had to tell someone that I love. I lost the baby. I don't know how I actually managed to get through the impossible task, but I did and we cried. We grieved and we hoped the doctor's were wrong. They weren't. We ended up going to the hospital to take misoprostol and deliver the baby. It was awful, the misoprostol dilated my cervix to 4 cm and my water broke and then I had to push. It was like I was going through (mini) labor essentially, but I wouldn't get to take home a baby at the end of it. On February 15th, 2017 at 9:18am Baby Bear was silently born, weighing 21 grams and measuring 4.5 inches long. For some reason the placenta wouldn't detach, so I had to have the d&amp;c anyways. \n\nAfter that first loss everything became about getting pregnant again. I needed to be pregnant again before my due date. And in April I got pregnant again. That pregnancy did not last long. I was spotting the entire time and at 6 weeks, it turned to full on bleeding. Fuck. My husband and I then decided we would NTNP for a couple months, just to try and reset mentally. And lo and behold we get pregnant again in June. I was so confident with this pregnancy. I felt positive that this would be my time. This would be my rainbow. I was having good, strong pregnancy symptoms, I wasn't having any bleeding or spotting, and zero cramping. I was still nervous as all get out of course, but I felt good about it. I was supposed to be almost 9 weeks today. It was supposed to make today alright. I could deal with my due date because I was pregnant again. Instead, this past Wednesday at the ultrasound, I was diagnosed with a blighted ovum. There was a gestational sac, a yolk sac, but no embryo. This hit me fucking HARD. What the hell was wrong with me? Why is it so hard to fucking carry a baby? Why can't I stay pregnant? Why would my body convince me everything is okay and make me feel tired and shitty if there was no baby in there?  \n\nSo instead of dealing with my due date being sad, but grateful I was pregnant again. I am dealing with it while bleeding and miscarrying my third pregnancy in 6 months, because my body has finally caught on that there is nothing there. And I'm just so goddamn sad and angry. So angry. I hate everyone right now, pregnant or not. I should be on my maternity leave. I should be delivering my baby boy, or I should be 17 weeks pregnant with my second pregnancy, or I should be 9 weeks pregnant with my third. What I should NOT be doing is going through this again. We will be setting up an appoint with an RE soon. I really hope they can do something for us as I really don't know how many more times I can get through this. My husband and I haven't lost hope yet, but a person can only go through so much. We have been trying for a year now and it's only been heartbreak and disappointment. \n\nSorry for the long post and for any typos and thanks for listening.", "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "ttcafterloss", "subreddit_id": "t5_34scd", "suggested_sort": null, "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Today is my due date", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/ttcafterloss/comments/6qastz/today_is_my_due_date/"}, {"approved_at_utc": null, "author": "AutoModerator", "author_created_utc": 1325741068, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_text": null, "author_fullname": "t2_6l4z3", "banned_at_utc": null, "brand_safe": false, "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1501398493, "distinguished": "moderator", "domain": "self.ttcafterloss", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/ttcafterloss/comments/6qg4dt/ttcafterloss_ttc_daily_discussion_thread_july_30/", "gilded": 0, "id": "6qg4dt", "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_css_class": "ttc", "link_flair_text": "TTC Thread", "locked": false, "media_embed": {}, "num_comments": 26, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/ttcafterloss/comments/6qg4dt/ttcafterloss_ttc_daily_discussion_thread_july_30/", "retrieved_on": 1502160655, "score": 3, "secure_media_embed": {}, "selftext": "**This thread is for members who are TTC or waiting to try.

It's turned into random heavier gushes over the past two days and has included a couple of small clots. I'm on CD9 of this cycle. My period ended 4 days ago, and I can already feel ovulation coming like clockwork.\n\nI took a pregnancy test just now and got a faint positive. I KNOW I am not pregnant because I ovulated before I was cleared to have sex again after the first D&amp;C, we used protection, and I had a period. I'm afraid I still have retained tissue, even though they did the second D&amp;C with ultrasound and told me they were sure it was all out.\n\nI haven't stopped bleeding for 35 days.

Ended up more disappointed than anything as I hadn't quite allowed myself to become too attached and excited as it felt too good to be true from the get go. This was our first time trying after HBC after all, it couldn't be that easy!!\n\nAs far as the actual miscarriage goes, it seems it was relatively simple, physically anyway. I bled, lightly, for a little more than 3 days. Dr confirmed HCG went from 6.3 at 5w3d to 3.5 at 5w5d. They said that is what they wanted to see, that my body was taking care of things. They recommended waiting until after I have another period before trying again, solely for dating any future pregnancy. \n\nI was sad and my husband and I had a couple of really down days, but we were busy. So after those couple days it seemed like we both kind of moved on. I mean, it wasn't really 'my baby' yet and I feel like I was more sad to be so disappointed because I've wanted a baby for years and Mr Furburger is older than me and worried about being too old when future babes graduate. He kept saying that it's OK and we'd try again and things would be fine. He didn't seem to ever really want to talk about it and so I guess we just left it at that. \n\nEvery now and again, I've found myself pondering the alternate timelines and such but I try not to let myself get too far down that path because it's disappointing and distracting. Now we've reached a point where we leave for a week's vacation with most of my family on Saturday and I would have been having my first u / s this week &amp; we'd planned on telling parents and family and such this week/next week. \n\nI'm also currently having my period [seems like the miscarriage was just a week ago &amp; seems weird to be at that point already!] , so informed husband last night that we could proceed with trying again. I'm so very excited to have babies and try again. In almost the same breath, I have a very strange - seemingly irrational - fear of trying again, just to avoid future disappointment.\n\nI *know* that I can't allow my hesitation and fear dictate things. I *know* CPs &amp; miscarriages are common. I *know* that the chances of a healthy successful pregnancy are in my favor. I *know* that it wasn't anything I did wrong. I'm afraid of never being able to truly enjoy any future pregnancies for fear of what might happen. Part of me also feels very indifferent to the whole situation, and I feel like that's wrong. Like I can't quite find the words to describe my thoughts or feelings, except for that I am so very sorry for those of you who've had to go through this multiple times and/or at a later gestation age. I'm sorry.\n\nAlso, side rant: Who the fuck ever thought it'd be a good idea to normalize asking women if they are pregnant unsolicited should be, at the very least, throat punched. No, I'm not having a beer because I have to work early in the morning. No, I've just gotten fat after my wedding, I'm not pregnant |anymore|. Where the fuck do you get off even THINKING it's a good idea to ask me that, no less in my workplace/on the phone/the grocery store, gtfoh.\n\nIf you've made it this far, thanks.

Apologies for the lengthy intro:\nMy partner & I have been thru 2 ivf/icsi cycles. The first was wildly unsuccessful at which point we switched clinics for a multitude of reasons. The second cycle was successful in the sense that I was able to get pregnant. Unfortunately at our 8 week ultrasound we found out growth stopped at 6.5 weeks and the heartbeat was way too slow. At 9 weeks the heartbeat had increased but growth was still halted at 6.5 weeks. At 10 weeks the heartbeat had ceased and I was given the options of having a natural miscarriage, using cytotec or having a d&c. \nI've been trying to take the natural route (with pain meds on standby). I've been going to a fertility acupuncturist to speed things along, taking herbs to help with her guidance (I'm a firm believer in complimentary medicine) and still nothing. Some cramping. Some old blood spitting. Some new blood spotting. My RE gave me a deadline of Monday where if it hasn't happened naturally (I'll be in my 12th week then) I should take the cytotec. \nWhat would you do? What did you do?\nI'm worried that since my body hasn't expelled it yet that there's a chance the cytotec won't work fully. I'm debating about the d&c but hesitating because it's another invasive treatment. I worry about scarring and further complicating things for another ivf try. I happen to know my RE will be in surgery Thursday. They work on a rotating schedule and if there's a way it could be my RE if I choose this route that would be preferable. \nI appreciate any insight.

(He's a crier, I think it's sweet). \n\nWe went in for our second appointment today at 10+6. I'd finally been starting to feel a little less nauseous, a little less tired. I was excited and nervous, just couldn't wait to hear that heartbeat. \n\nFirst she tried to find it on the Doppler, she warned me that it may be too early to find and not to worry. Searching, searching... Nothing. She pulls in the ultrasound machine and does an abdominal ultrasound, I'm looking and there is nothing coming up on the screen. She says, \"I'm not seeing what I would expect to see in a viable pregnancy.\" My husband started crying, I started crying. She did a transvaginal ultrasound to confirm and there was our little peanut, no bigger than before, not moving, no heartbeat. \n\nShe said it hadn't developed any more since the last appointment. Which means that it's been almost 4 weeks without me spontaneously miscarrying, no spotting, nothing. \n\nSo I have an appointment next week to talk with the obgyn about a D&C. \n\nWe're devastated. I actually think my husband is taking it harder than me, I've always known that it was a possibility and I've had several relatives who have had difficulty conceiving. I don't think he ever really thought it was a possibility. \n\nWe've been crying all day in between trying to get stuff done. Well, he's been crying a lot and I've mostly just been shutting down, internalizing. He's so good, too, reminding me not to shut down or shut him out, suggesting counseling, just being wonderful and supportive. \n\nI am crushed, but I know it is not uncommon and that it is not the end of our journey. I don't think it will be the last time we cry over our child, but I do hope it is the last we lose. \n\nSo now I guess I am just waiting for a D&C and then a few months before we can try again?

I also have foster children on my caseload who have been removed from their parents, but are in the process of be reunited. \n\nIt's really difficult for me to meet with pregnant women or new mothers who have used drugs throughout their whole pregnancy and are about to give birth or have given birth to a living child. Aside for being glad of course that a healthy child was born, I am so freaking jealous.

But I cut out caffeine, gave up my vegetarian diet to ensure I was getting enough protein, wouldn't lift over five pounds, drank the most water I have ever had in my whole life and I had a miscarriage, while these mothers do cocaine and heroin and don't eat for days and use dirty needles and their babies live. \n\nThe children that I have in foster care are a different kind of pain.

I am often mistaken for their mother as I do things for them that mothers usually do (doctor's appointments, therapy, new glasses, Starbucks cake pops). So when they say, \"are you so-so's mother?\" It breaks my heart, because I am nobody's mother. After several of these incidents, a five-year old in foster care demanded to know if I actually was his mother and accused me of lying when I said no. When their parents miss visits with them, they cry and I want to be their mother in those moments. I want to give them the love for the child I didn't get to have.\n\nI want to quit my job, honestly, because it makes me feel itchy and sad and bad because my whole world is children and babies.

During week 8 I passed clots/ and bright red blood. I was convinced it was a loss at the time but the ultrasounds at week 8 and 9 both confirmed that the baby was still alive and had a heartbeat. Around week 11, I started feeling better, much better. I was finally feeling excited about having another baby.\n\nToday I was supposed to be 12 weeks along. We went for our NT ultrasound and blood work. I knew something was wrong when the ultrasound technician stopped the scan much sooner than I remembered them doing with my first and saying that they just need to get the doctor and fill out some paperwork. The doctor explained that the baby had no heartbeat. I didn't believe her and I asked if she was sure. I was convinced the machine was not working. I wasn't crying yet. I was calm as a cucumber. Soon after the doctor left and my husband was brought in by the tech. I shook my head at him, he understood immediately. I didn't expect to but I started crying and I just couldn't stop. I cried and I cried. I wanted to know when it happened. I looked at the screen and it showed that the fetus was 11w1d. It ended 6 days ago. I've had no cramps, no spotting, nothing.

No groups that do catch/alter/release or anything like that. \n\nMy husband and I are big animal rescue people (we have 2 dogs, 2 cats, 2 snakes, 2 pigeons, 3 rats, and a couple fish tanks -- who needs a social life when you have fluffy, feathery, or scaly things to take care of, right??), but we have realized that we just don't have the resources to rescue all the strays or even catch/alter/release just the ones on our street. We did take in one that came right up to us and was declawed, but it took us 2 months just to find her a home, and it was miserable trying to keep her separated from our two cats the whole time (who she refused to not try to attack). \n\nWe'd pretty much come to terms with it and resigned to just waving at any kitty that wanders across the other side of the road and naming them all based on appearance (our street is patrolled by Ms. Grey, Orangey, Stripes, and Mist), but then earlier this week when I got back from the grocery store, a little calico kitten (probably 6-9 months old) with tabby stripes was sitting on my porch and meow-shrieked at me as soon as I got out of the car. She immediately ran up to me and started rubbing on me, purring loudly.\n\nThis little thing is obviously pregnant and so, so tiny. And she was still skin and bones, covered in fleas :'( Ugh. \n\nUsually the strays were, like I said, feral, running as soon as they knew they were spotted or at least hissing and generally being unfriendly. But this little one was obviously friendly and desperate. We had agreed not to feed any of the strays, but I couldn't help it and gave her a can, and she was SO HAPPY. She ate the entire can before she even looked up to breathe, and then came right over to lay in my lap. I then noticed the fleas hopping off of her, and went inside to grab one of the cheap flea preventatives we had used for the last stray we took in. I checked and it was safe for pregnant cats, so I put it on her and hoped it would help.\n\nShe left that evening after hanging around to be pet for a few hours, and I hoped that she would be okay.\n\n....but then she came back the next day, walked straight through my office door (I work from home), and hopped into my lap to sleep. The fleas were gone and she looked SO much better, but she's still skinny and getting more pregnant by the day.\n\nShe's come back to hang out with us every day since. Even now, she's laying in my lap purring and I can feel her kittens moving around in her belly :/ Ugh. I'm jealous of a freaking cat! And the thought of her getting hit by a car or attacked by another stray and her losing her kittens is enough to make me teary-eyed.\n\nShe's so sweet and obviously she has decided to stick around us because we won't let her starve... but finding her (and however many kittens she has) homes will be a pain in the butt.\n\nSpay and neuter your pets, people.

I won't lie. I read a lot of posts online about people's experiences but I guess wasn't really prepared for my own. Here I was concerned about having to take a second or third dose. Luckily, I didn't get that far. So here's what happened. \n\n11:00 am - pills inserted by my GP. I laid there for about 45 minutes. \n\n12:00 pm - on my way home. Started feeling very mild cramps, nothing serious. \n\n1:30 pm - moderate cramps. \n\n3:30 pm  - cramps are now contractions now. Coming and going with peaks. \n\n4:30 pm - some  light bleeding. \n\n4:45-5:30 pm - contractions are back and I felt a sudden pop. Soaked through my extra heavy overnight bad. Then I soaked through another. I realized it wasn't going to stop and only get worse so I put on an adult diaper. Also, I realize I'm losing a lot more blood than I should and I'm starting to feel faint, so we we decided to go to the ER. I was in pain and I was bleeding more than 2-3 pads in an hour. \n\n6:00 - 1am - showed up at the ER and soaked through a diaper so I needed another. I soaked through that within 30 minutes. During this time I had really bad contractions and I went through 5 diapers while waiting and I was passing very large clots. I ruined my clothes. I was feeling faint and vomiting. Passed a very large clot around midnight and this is when I started feeling much better. I was also given an IV as well and had a blood test done to see how much blood I lost. I had lost a lot but not enough to need a D&C right away. So I was asked to come back in the morning for an ultrasound and follow up with the doctor. \n\nNext day: \n\n11am-1pm - I was told I passed almost everything and only had small clots left. I don't need a D&C. It was pretty strange seeing an empty womb on the screen. \n\nIt was a painful experience and I didn't expect to be as bad as this but I'm glad this ordeal is over so I can move on with my life. Other things that I have not shared which happened during this time made this experience even more traumatic than it needed to be. So I feel pretty discouraged about wanting to try for another baby anytime soon. \n\nSorry about any typos or grammar mistakes.

So, here's my story:\n\nThis was our first pregnancy and was to be the first grandchild for both sides. We had both sets of soon-to-be-grandparents and a few close friends already in the loop, all begging us to let them take the news public. Most exciting was the fact that my due date was only two days shy of my best friends due date, and she had just purchased a house down the road from our house. Without planning it, we were getting to share our pregnancy journeys together, as both best friends and neighbours. It was a dream come true. I also had a girl in my department at work who was also pregnant with her first, and was due in the same month as me, a few weeks after. My husbands coworker was also pregnant with her first. I was surrounded by the support of other people experiencing the same thing as me, and it was wonderful. \n\nOn Thursday August 3rd, my husband and I excitedly took the day off work so we could go to my first ultrasound appointment together- we had reached the 12 week mark and were finally going to see the baby!! I had already made a video that we planned to use as our public Facebook announcement, and all it needed was the final image of the ultrasound picture. As soon as we got home, we planned to load the picture and share our news with the world. But that didn't happen. \n\nOur ultrasound appointment revealed that my 12 week pregnancy was measuring at only 8 weeks and 5 days, and there was no fetal activity and they couldn't find a heartbeat. They told us to go to the ER, and by 5pm the next day, i was in the hospital getting a D&C. \n\nSo here we are, it's Sunday morning and I'm no longer pregnant. The \"reveal\" video I made is still open on my laptop, awaiting that last slide. My What To Expect app is still telling me what fruit my baby is the size of. The \"Grandma-To-Be in Feb 2018\" medallion that I got for my mom has been shipped from the Etsy supplier and will probably arrive any day. \n\nThe OB made it very clear that this had nothing to do with me or my husband, and the baby was just lacking the necessary chromosomes to survive. He said we have no reason to anticipate any problems with our next pregnancy. But I'm sad because it was all so perfect, and I lost it- the family was all so excited. We got pregnant exactly when we wanted to, on our first try. I was ecstatic to be pregnant alongside so many friends. We'd talked about doing photos of all of us pregnant together. My best friend and I had a week planned when we wanted to get pre-delivery pedicures together. We had plans for fun Halloween costumes that incorporated our bellies. Now they all get to carry on, and I'm not a part of it anymore. I'm the odd-one out who's not pregnant anymore. Come February, I'll have 4 close friends nursing new infants, and I'll be constantly reminded that I wasn't supposed to be one of them. But I won't be.

I was diagnosed with a rather large SCH (4.5x4x1cm) about a week before the loss happened. Luckily I passed everything on my own, so no procedure or medicine needed.\n\nI read the sidebar, and found some good info, but I'd still love to hear about anyone else's experiences TTC again after a loss, especially an SCH-related one. I spoke with a doctor (not my normal OBGYN bc she was on call) at the office today and was frustrated because I think some of what he said to me was flat-out wrong... (e.g. that there was definitely a chromosomal problem that caused both the SCH and the miscarriage. I have not read that anywhere else. I am fairly certain the SCH caused the miscarriage, and that's what my regular OB led me to believe could happen. The baby had a normal heartbeat at 6w1d and was perfectly on track size-wise.)\n\nAnyway, some questions, in case anyone has similar experiences & feels like sharing.\n\n-Did your doctor recommend waiting to TTC after a loss? From what I'm reading they only do this for dating purposes, and if I track and know when I ovulated, is there a need to get a period for dating purposes? Or is there some other reason to wait to TTC?\n\n-Has anyone else gotten a clear answer about recurrence of SCHs or anything to do/not do while TTC to avoid them? My understanding is they're just random, but curious if anyone's docs have told them otherwise or recommended precautions/testing/etc.\n\nAnyway - back to the world of temping and tracking and fingers crossed for a better outcome.\n\nHope all of you are doing as well as can be on this complicated journey.\n\nIf anyone has gone through something similar and would be open to chatting 1-1, I'd appreciate that as well.\n\nxo\n", "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "ttcafterloss", "subreddit_id": "t5_34scd", "suggested_sort": null, "thumbnail": "self", "thumbnail_height": null, "thumbnail_width": null, "title": "Loss due to SCH, TTC again - Some questions & Any Advice/Wisdom Welcome (x-post with edits from r/TryingForaBaby)", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/ttcafterloss/comments/6s6qls/loss_due_to_sch_ttc_again_some_questions_any/", "view_count": null}, {"approved_at_utc": null, "author": "AKMusher", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_text": null, "banned_at_utc": null, "brand_safe": false, "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1502128660, "domain": "self.ttcafterloss", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/ttcafterloss/comments/6s7ar5/does_anyone_else_have_a_partner_that_just_doesnt/", "id": "6s7ar5", "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "locked": false, "num_comments": 15, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/ttcafterloss/comments/6s7ar5/does_anyone_else_have_a_partner_that_just_doesnt/", "retrieved_on": 1502211194, "score": 7, "selftext": "I posted this in /r/miscarriage but this sub is more active so figured I'd post it here. \n\nI suffered a loss at 6+1 back in May. It was my first pregnancy, and my husband's 2nd child (he has a 5 year old with a previous girlfriend). I took it extremely hard, but my husband never really showed any emotion about it. I don't cry like I did in the weeks after it happened, but I still get upset, sometimes jealous at other pregnant women, or feel like it's unfair it happened to me. I often think about where I would be in the pregnancy now and long for that. We're TTC again but it's extremely frustrating to me that we're going through that again - I keep thinking \"I should be pregnant, we shouldn't even be having to do this again.\" \n\nMy husband doesn't seem to understand how I'm feeling and has said some things that really upset me. Things like \"It's over, there's nothing we can do about it, it's time to move on.\" Or when I ask how he can not feel anything he says \"It didn't even have a heartbeat yet.\" I correct him and let him know that it DID have a heart and a heart beat, we just hadn't gotten to hear it yet. \n\nWhen stressing about TTC and wondering if I'll get a positive test, I'll text him something like \"Took a test this morning, it was negative.\" I'm hoping for him to say something like \"I'm sorry hun, I'm sure we'll get a positive soon.\" Instead he just responds \"OK.\" He says that me being upset about the miscarriage and stressing over when we'll get pregnant again is making it \"not enjoyable anymore\" for him. \n\nI sent him a poem about miscarriage, trying to explain how I felt (it's a wonderful poem, titled Just Those Few Weeks, for those curious), and didn't get any response. When I sent it to him again, he responded \"Am I supposed to say something\". \n\nI just don't know what to do. I feel like he's supposed to be supporting me, even if he doesn't understand how I'm feeling. Beyond that, I just don't understand how he can't be sad about our loss. I'm not sure what to do. I'm leaning towards seeking counseling, so I can at least feel like there's someone supporting me, even if it's a total stranger.

I was told that due to a ruptured appendix causing thick layers of adhesions in my youth that chances of conception on our own would be nearly impossible.

It was a complete surprise. So many things had to have been just right for it to happen. My husband and I were still trying to come to terms with things, but at our first appointment at 9 weeks, it was undeniable. Strong heartbeat, arms and legs wiggling... It was so surreal. I never had any morning sickness, boobs were huge and heavy, but otherwise felt great the whole time. We felt confident announcing things right before our 13 week appointment...\n\nWe announced, we were excited, friends and family were excited, it was so great. I went to my second appointment alone. They had terrible finding the heartbeat on the Doppler, so looked on an old ultrasound machine since their tech was busy. I knew immediately. Everything was still. I felt numb. The NP wanted me to still see the tech, and I waited totally alone for what felt like forever, knowing my baby was gone. I finally was called into the ultrasound room, where the tech confirmed that the baby measured right at 10 weeks, and there was no heartbeat. \n\nMy heart felt shattered in a way I didn't even know was physically possible. I texted my husband (who was in class) and he came home right away. I honestly don't remember much else. I ended up deciding to do a d&c because I didn't think I could handle passing our baby myself. My OB was on vacation, so another doctor did the procedure. It went mostly well. I ended up passing some missed tissue a few days later with major cramps. \n\nThat's when all the pregnancy announcements started. There was no one for so freaking long, and then, EVERYONE. It was physically gut wrenching every time something popped up on Facebook. I promptly blocked every single person. It hurts even more because they're people I care about. I feel like such a shitty friend because I just can't bring up an ounce of happiness for them because I'm so broken and hurt. On mother's day, a pregnant woman was walking out of Walmart behind if and the greeter called out \"happy future mother's day!\" And I just started crying on the way to my car.\n\nMy due date should be September 27th. It's coming up soon and I'm just so ready for it to be over so I can quit thinking about these milestones I should have reached. Honestly, I've started to feel more at peace, but I still have really bad days, like today. Usually when I PMS.. but my husband and I are ready to start trying. I'm just terrified of it happening again. Miscarriage changed me in ways that I hate. I was always such a happy and optimistic person for the most part, and I'm just not all the time any more, and I feel jealous of all these women I see who are experiencing things I feel like I should be experiencing... But I'm really trying to be hopeful in the future. \n\nI keep searching though this thread, eagerly waiting to hear other stories to help me feel like my feelings and struggles are valid, and then it hit me that maybe there are other women like me, and that maybe it's my turn to share for them. This thread has been so encouraging and valuable to me in one of the hardest things I've ever experienced. And I hope someday, when I have a baby of my own, and can be that same encouragement and hope to others.", "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "ttcafterloss", "subreddit_id": "t5_34scd", "suggested_sort": null, "thumbnail": "self", "thumbnail_height": null, "thumbnail_width": null, "title": "Long time lurker.. but I feel ready to talk now", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/ttcafterloss/comments/6srek3/long_time_lurker_but_i_feel_ready_to_talk_now/", "view_count": null, "whitelist_status": null}, {"approved_at_utc": null, "author": "AutoModerator", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_text": null, "banned_at_utc": null, "brand_safe": false, "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1502348857, "distinguished": "moderator", "domain": "self.ttcafterloss", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/ttcafterloss/comments/6sroim/ttcafterloss_ttc_daily_discussion_thread_august/", "id": "6sroim", "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_css_class": "ttc", "link_flair_text": "TTC Thread", "locked": false, "num_comments": 50, "over_18": false, "parent_whitelist_status": null, "permalink": "/r/ttcafterloss/comments/6sroim/ttcafterloss_ttc_daily_discussion_thread_august/", "retrieved_on": 1502430015, "score": 2, "selftext": "**This thread is for members who are TTC or waiting to try.

For example, I've read that one clinic is open to testing for NK immune cells, whereas another doesn't believe in the NK theory at all and is likely to tell women that it was bad luck and to try again.\n\nI'm very nervous about my clinic appointment, in part because I'm still grieving my recent loss, and also because my birthday is in a few weeks, and I feel like time is running out. \n\nI wonder if there are any UK contributors who have been to a recurrent miscarriage clinic and can tell me about their experiences.

Sorry it is so long.\n\nI have PCOS and very irregular periods so I always assumed it would be difficult to conceive. However, when I first fell pregnant in 2015 it was actually unplanned. We were over the moon though! My sister was also pregnant with her first child and we were due 6 weeks apart which made it even more exciting.\n\nWe got to the 12 week mark thinking everything was fine but at the first scan, discovered there was no heartbeat. The baby measured 7w5d. We tried medical management but despite lots of bleeding and pain, it didn't work so a week later I had a D&C. By this point I had an infection and subsequently got thrush from the antibiotics. It was all a pretty horrendous time.\n\nWe tried and failed for 9 months to get pregnant after this, before deciding to put it all on hold. On this gap we went on holidays and planned our wedding. We stopped using contraception again just before the wedding and to my utter surprise fell pregnant straight away - I had the positive test on my wedding day!\n\nShortly afterwards, I started bleeding. It was only light and an ultrasound showed that the baby was fine and despite only measuring 5-6 weeks, a strong heartbeat could be seen.\n\nThe bleeding continued so 12 days later I went for a second ultrasound. This time we discovered that although the baby had grown, it had not grown as much as it should've. And although they found a heartbeat, it was very slow.\n\nSince then, I have been waiting to miscarry. So far it hasn't happened and I have another scan booked for Monday to see the latest position. I strongly suspect another missed miscarriage and I am already grieving for the loss of our second child.\n\nSo that's me.

I wanted our kids close in age. Our son will be 3 in October. I want then as close as possible. This makes me want to start in september.\n\n2. I am starting to feel more like my self again. I am working out alot and it feels great. When I was pregnant with my daughter I was to sick to run and that led to me not feeling like myself \n\n3. I am managing and not taking any anxiety medication. I am scared pregnancy and the 4th trimester will push me over with anxiety. Will that get better if I give myself more time?\n\n4. I just have baby fever. \n\n5. I am scared people will treat future baby as a fix or replacement. I do not want that. Also I am so tired of stupid people.\n\nTLDR how so you decide when to try again after infant loss", "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "ttcafterloss", "subreddit_id": "t5_34scd", "suggested_sort": null, "thumbnail": "self", "thumbnail_height": null, "thumbnail_width": null, "title": "TTC after infant loss and meds", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/ttcafterloss/comments/6tgd9v/ttc_after_infant_loss_and_meds/", "view_count": null, "whitelist_status": null}]}
