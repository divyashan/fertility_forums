I'm in the middle of my 3rd loss and in the horrible what kind of loss is this limbo.  Hcg was 113 at 10-11 dpo which seemed good!  I was starting to think my spotting was implantation bleeding!  But then 3 days later (yesterday) it was 129.  So strange because my tests got noticeably darker (frer almost equal to control line) the day before the 2nd draw.  But maybe they rose and then started falling in that time, cool \ud83d\ude15.  \n\nOn the one hand, this is extra shitty cause today is the anniversary of my first d and c and Sunday is my second due date anniversary, so I was hoping to hang on to hope for this pregnancy at least till Monday cause that's as far as I could imagine it when I found out.  That's messed up- but hoping for 40 weeks seemed unreasonable.  On the other hand, yesterday's phone call gave me some relief from the horrible anxiety I've had all week since I first got a positive.   I was so caught off guard by how hard it was to be hopeful.  \n\nNow I'm terrified this is ectopic because I don't want to wait to try anymore.  I want a normal chemical so I can bleed and get on with my life, but my numbers seem a little high for that? And that has its own set of concerns, is this related to my surgery?  Are things worse down there so instead of allowing crappy implantation that limps along for 12 weeks I now can't implant at all?  Or am I just stupid for testing at 8-9 dpo and this is one of the 50% that don't make it to 4 weeks and it's all totally unrelated to my history. \n\nI'm also pissed because I have to continue my progesterone suppositories till Monday and wait for another blood draw.  AF is due this weekend so I'd rather just not sustain anything nonviable and get on with the next cycle.  And also, it's fucking Christmas!!!  I have a million plans this weekend, luckily mostly with my friends without kids.  Maybe I'll have a drink, fuck it.   \n\nAnyways, sorry for the word vomit but I haven't been able to post much this week out of anxiety and not feeling like a true alumn.  If anyone has thoughts about my hcg levels, would love to hear it.  Or advice about getting ectopics diagnosed.  Thank you all for this space to vent; my husband is pretty over the obsessing at this point and I haven't even told anyone else.  \ud83d\udc00\ud83d\udc94\ud83d\udca9\n\n", "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "ttcafterloss", "subreddit_id": "t5_34scd", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Icing on the anniversary weekend cake (TW loss in progress)", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/ttcafterloss/comments/5hk88y/icing_on_the_anniversary_weekend_cake_tw_loss_in/"}, {"author": "thelastpear", "author_created_utc": 1461091165, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_text": null, "author_fullname": "t2_xatp8", "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1481379851, "domain": "self.ttcafterloss", "edited": 1481380479, "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/ttcafterloss/comments/5hkbq5/intro_soooo_angry_tw_medical_termination/", "gilded": 0, "id": "5hkbq5", "is_self": true, "link_flair_css_class": "intro", "link_flair_text": "Intro", "locked": false, "media_embed": {}, "num_comments": 42, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/ttcafterloss/comments/5hkbq5/intro_soooo_angry_tw_medical_termination/", "retrieved_on": 1484386918, "score": 39, "secure_media_embed": {}, "selftext": "https://www.buzzfeed.com/kaelintully/youre-the-best-friend-that-i-ever-had-1Friends,\n\nYour stories have helped me so much. I have trouble crying over my own problems and it helped me to first cry over yours. \n\nMy doctor found an abnormality that made my fetus incompatible with life. I could have waited to see what, exactly, was going to cause its death, waited for it to die on its own, or I could terminate. As I have a history with depression, I opted to terminate. To reiterate, the pregnancy was definitely doomed, my perinatologist just said if I wanted to find out what specifically was dooming it, I could wait. \n\nI had the procedure two weeks ago. I was lucky to find a wonderful and caring clinic and have nothing but positive things to say about them. My own doctors were also terrific. I'm healing both physically and emotionally. I know I have done the right thing. \n\nSo why am I so angry?\n\nThe clinic was out of state. I had to drive four and a half hours to the next state, where I know no one, and stay in a hotel. All because the narrow minded, fossilized dick cheeses who run my piece of shit red state all but banned abort!on here. The only clinic left standing has a four week wait list and bullet proof glass to keep out assassins. \n\nThe procedure was the same many of you have undergone for missed miscarriages. My perinatologist, whom I trust and like, was perfectly capable of doing it. But she couldn't, because the fetus still had a heartbeat. So I had to drive to the next state in order to terminate the pregnancy I had desperately wanted. I had to walk past evil zealot protestors. I had to pay out of pocket for a simple medical procedure, since I am a state employee and my insurance doesn't cover it. \n\nThis past week, another dick cheese state (holla Ohio) decided to pass two bills making abort!on harder. As all of you know better than anyone, these bills affect and hurt us. Not all pregnancies end the way we want them to, and it endangers us in a very real way to not have options.\n\nYou betcha that all my Trump supporting family members are getting donations to Planned Parenthood and NARAL this year for Christmas.   \n\n*primal scream*\n", "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "ttcafterloss", "subreddit_id": "t5_34scd", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Intro: soooo angry (tw medical termination)", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/ttcafterloss/comments/5hkbq5/intro_soooo_angry_tw_medical_termination/"}, {"author": "aformergruber", "author_created_utc": 1461699523, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_text": null, "author_fullname": "t2_xh7at", "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1481418269, "domain": "self.ttcafterloss", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/ttcafterloss/comments/5hnia9/ovulation_after_mc/", "gilded": 0, "id": "5hnia9", "is_self": true, "locked": false, "media_embed": {}, "num_comments": 6, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/ttcafterloss/comments/5hnia9/ovulation_after_mc/", "retrieved_on": 1484388656, "score": 5, "secure_media_embed": {}, "selftext": "I had a D&amp;C at 8+2 after my doctor told me there was no longer a heartbeat and that our baby hadn't grown past 6+2.

Last May, me and my boyfriend at the time found out we were pregnant. We weren't trying so we were a little shaken up by this surprise. We were so scared but after a couple days I was able to get excited. Being a mother was everything I wanted ever since I remember. Everyone I know knows how I longed to be a mother, so to have this blessing with the love of my life was a dream come true. We got married a few months after with close friends and family but the best part was having our daughter inside me growing when we got married. The day we got married was flawless...no drama, no stress, just celebration and love. My husband and I have known each other since Kindergarten, best friends since high school and have been boyfriend and girlfriend for 5 years. He's my everything. He's my strength, best friend, makes me feel safe and confident. We were so excited to be a little family. My pregnancy was a smooth one with good doctor appointments, normal lab readings and I loved feeling our little girl moving and rolling in me. As my belly grew, the more we began to prepare for her. I loved being pregnant and looking at the mirror at awe of my belly. I loved being asked how I was doing at work and people wanting to feel my belly. I was so proud of our baby when she would kick back when friends and family would rub my belly. I was so proud. Last weekend, we went out to get a Christmas tree and I got stockings for us...thats the last time I felt her kick. I remember her kicking me and telling her dad how good of a kicker she was. We daydreamed about her playing soccer and hula dancing...never in my life did I think what would happen that Monday would happen. I knew something wasnt right Monday morning when I woke up for work and I woke up my husband immediately. We sped to the ER and that's when we heard the worst news anyone could ever hear. They couldn't find her heart beat. I remember screaming WHAT?! because how is that possible?! I just had an appointment that went great the week before. I was 32 weeks along and I only had 8 weeks left..how is this possible?! I had my baby shower coming up..everyone knew I was pregnant.\nMy doctor sent me home with some medication to start labor and it was the most agonizing thing I've ever had to go thru. Just waiting with my family surrounding me to deliver our baby sleeping.\nAt first my husband and I weren't sure if we wanted to see our baby at first. But after a fast delivery, I just wanted to hold her. We held her, lover her, took pictures of her all day and I felt complete for that time. I felt like I had my family together like how I've dreamed of it all my life. The moment we had to say good bye reality sank in...it especially sank in when we left the hospital without a baby. All we had was a teddy bear and a memory box with her foot prints, measurements and a lock of hair. Our daughter had a lot of hair..just like her mom and dad. I'll always remember seeing my husband with her. How he looked at her with love in his eyes and how he cupped her little head with his big hands. Again, it was something i've always dreamed of.\nNow, that we're home and recovering..I'm still searching for answers, I'm going thru my whole pregnancy where I could go wrong. I feel so mad because my milk has come and I dont have my baby to feed. I miss being happy. I'm scared to move on with life..i'm scared to see coworkers and friends with their sorry faces looking at me or when I bump into someone who doesn't know and I have to explain to them what happened. I'm just scared.\nI pray that our baby is in heaven looking down on me and her daddy. I pray that she's with her family and that they are taking care of her. I pray that I have the strength to carry on with her memory...to build up enough strength to try again and have a sibling for our daughter. I pray that she hand picks that baby and looks out for all of us. I miss her so much....She's brought so much happiness and joy to me and her dad and for that I thank her.

I recently miscarried at 5 weeks 4 days. It started last Thursday evening and it's still going on today although today is the first day that the blood is brown instead of saturated red. I've been to my OB today who did an ultrasound and said that the miscarriage is complete and everything seemed to be expelled properly (except corpus luteum which she saw in/around my ovary and she said that would disappear on its own). I was referred to this sub by some wonderful and supportive ladies from TFAB. Ever since it happened I've been haunted by irrational questions like why did it happen? Was it the sex that morning? Was it because I started taking whey protein two days before? Was it because I didn't eat well that day? I know these are all irrational and that the answer is clear: it was bound to happen, nothing to be done about it. My OB today said that this was already determined at the moment the egg met sperm and there was nothing to do. She also said every woman experiences at least one miscarriage (it definitely sounds like a gross generalization but that's what she said).\n\nI finally have some practical questions that I thought maybe you can help me with:\n\n1. Ever since I got a BFP the lines have been very faint. The first faint squinter was on DPO12 and while the lines did darken over time they always remained rather faint. For instance the last one I took on DPO 18 or 19 was definitely visible (no longer a squinter) but it was definitely not as dark as the control line. It also kept taking long for it to appear. I am now wondering if that was a telltale of an impending miscarriage. Is it? That either the embryo was never strong to begin with or that the HCG levels weren't doubling as they should? Does anyone have an answer for that?\n\n2. Another one is about my temps. I've been continuing with FF all this time. I've noticed that since Thursday (evening that I began to MC) my temps went a bit down but still were well above the cover line. On Saturday they went just below cover line but Sunday and today (Monday) they went up again. Any idea why that is? Does it mean anything? Is it just left over progesterone? (my chart: https://fertilityfriend.com/home/68248b)\n\n3. I also intend to start TTC right away. My OB today told me to wait until I get my period to start trying again to make sure the uterine lining is ready. However, everything I read online suggests there is no reason to wait. I guess I was just curious of your opinions on this.\n\n4. My OB also prescribed a 3 day course of antibiotics to prevent a possible infection. Anyone ever heard of that? I don't plan on taking them because I'm not sure 'preventive measure' is a good enough reason. I don't want to overwhelm my body with medications now. \n\nEDIT add 5: My cervix is still pretty high up. Not at all like during a period. Is there any reason for it or does it mean anything? Or is it because things are still messed up down there?\n\nI'm sorry that we are all here.

I was nervous and excited when we got pregnant.  My doctor wanted me to come in around 6 weeks to check me out and listen to the heartbeat - I knew immediately from the ultrasound tech's face that something was wrong.  Then led to a flurry of interventions eventually leading to a D&amp;C and the next day a trip to the ER to get a Methotrexate shot.\n\nAs you all know, this has been a horrific, emotionally-laden journey.

I am new to this sub and am very impressed with the community and fellowship you ladies have with each other when dealing with such an awful thing. Today I experienced a loss at 5 weeks 3 days and have a few questions. My situation is a little odd and I will be as brief as possible.\n\n\nI began a fellowship at a School of Medicine and therefore had access to their student/trainee health. When I was promoted to faculty earlier this year, I had to find doctors outside the student health center. I found an OB/GYN but she wound up leaving a few months ago. Therefore, I do not have an OB/GYN. \n\n\nWhen I first got my BFP I called an OB recommended to me by a friend and of course they refused to see me before 8 weeks. Here are my questions:\n\n\n1. Do I need to visit the doc after this pregnancy loss? I informed my GP but I think she is pretty clueless to this whole process.\n\n2. If I do need to go to the doc, should I go to an OB or a GYN? It seems like the OBs don't want to see you unless you are pregnant.\n\n3. For future TTC endeavors, should I request my GP do serial beta HCG as soon as I get a BFP? Or should I try to find an OB who will work with me prior to 8 weeks?\n\n\nThis entire thing has been so confusing. I was really frustrated with the whole OB issue when I was still getting BFPs, and now that I've miscarried I am angered and sad by the seemingly nonchalant approach to this by the healthcare providers in my life. I really want a proactive OB/GYN who will consider me their patient before 8 weeks, but that doesn't seem to exist.\n\n\nAny help from you ladies would be so appreciated!", "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "ttcafterloss", "subreddit_id": "t5_34scd", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Questions after First Loss", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/ttcafterloss/comments/5i80t9/questions_after_first_loss/"}, {"author": "buddhaboob", "author_created_utc": 1389639420, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_text": null, "author_fullname": "t2_esluq", "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1481685860, "domain": "self.ttcafterloss", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/ttcafterloss/comments/5i89nf/intro_and_tell_me_about_your_doctors/", "gilded": 0, "id": "5i89nf", "is_self": true, "link_flair_css_class": "intro", "link_flair_text": "Intro", "locked": false, "media_embed": {}, "num_comments": 10, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/ttcafterloss/comments/5i89nf/intro_and_tell_me_about_your_doctors/", "retrieved_on": 1484400090, "score": 7, "secure_media_embed": {}, "selftext": "Hi, um, pleased to meet you all but sad to be here? I'm 33, got lucky on our 5th cycle trying for #1.  Or so we thought. (do we TW for loss of a loss board? I don't know...but TW: loss, there you go) \n\nMy doctor hasn't confirmed a loss, but last week at our 8w u/s there wasn't much to see, just a sac, no pole or heartbeat as far as we can tell.  They booked me for a repeat u/s in 10 days, hoping my dates are wrong (spoiler alert, they're not!) and told me to call if I started bleeding. Then they handed me a bag of prenatal samples.  \n\nThey tested my progesterone that day , but not hcg. Progesterone was at 2.9, and the office wouldn't confirm but I took that to mean I was going to miscarry, based on Dr. Google. On Friday I'm pretty sure I did.  From wednesday to now, actually, and I have another u/s tmrw to confirm. From what I've read, it sounds like I had things pretty easy as far as natural m/c goes. \n\nI had to beg them to see me prior to this Friday. They seem really laid back about the whole thing.  When I started bleeding I called, and they just told me to call if the bleeding got worse.  So I called, they said call if it got worse again. My heart rate is way down (total nosedive since Wednesday) and I'm pretty sure I know what I saw come out of me this weekend.  They finally agreed to see me for the repeat tomorrow since I've now stopped bleeding. \n\nInstead of a bag of prenatal samples, I would've appreciated some pads and a pamphlet entitled \"What to Expect when You're Expecting...a Miscarriage.\" My husband was still holding out hope because nobody really confirmed anything at the office that day. I tried to prepare him, but it's hard. He's crushed. \n\nI'm heartbroken that this baby wasn't meant to be, and I just want the whole thing to be over so that we can try again.  \n\nBut if I'm not pregnant and everything has passed, I'd like to get confirmation and get back to, TTC, to my normal workouts and to have a drink.  It's a special kind of torture that we have to spend such a stressful, painful time without certain vices or coping mechanisms. Or fucking insertive sex.\n\nI'm frustrated since here I was thinking I was pregnant for 5 weeks and all along something was wrong.

I've posted there about my entire journey to finding out. \n\nOur quad screen was positive for down syndrome so we were referred to a specialist for a LVL2 ultrasound. The results of this were worse than we expected. \n \nHypoplastic Left Heart Syndrome, Cystic Hygroma and Hydrops Fetalis. \n\nThe doctor thinks we will loose her within the next 4-8 weeks. \n\nLiving in Texas the laws are so horrible, that even so we are not sure we will be able to legally terminate. We'd probably have to go out of state. Since I'm officially at 20+2 weeks. And we want to wait for the results of the amniocentesis we had on monday. \n\nI'm so, so torn. I change my mind about terminating and not terminating every 20 minutes. I want nothing more than the doctors to be wrong. But I know deep down they're not. I can't take care of my toddler because i'm so on edge. I can pull through until around 4 and then I'm so exhausted mentally, that I don't want my 19 month old around, I can't deal with her tantrums, I cry and I don't even want her to cuddle with me. \n\nI'm mad with myself for this. I'm also blaming myself. I was never sure I wanted this baby. When we learned that I was pregnant my reaction was \"Oh shit\" it was not planned. I had no connection to her. I just wanted her to \"be gone\". I'm already seeing a therapist for prenatal depression. I have not have an appointment since we received the news. I've since spiraled. I can't sleep. I don't want to eat. I don't see the point in anything and I break down regularly. \n\nI always wanted my children to be close in age. My oldest would have been just 2 when this baby would have been born.Now this will not happen. Instead of looking for a crib we need to decide on a burial or cremation. I just can't take this anymore. I don't know how to deal with this pain. I've never cut or anything but the fantasy keeps popping up when I break down. And I'm afraid one day I will act on it. \n\n(yes i plan on talking about all of this with my therapist. my appointment is on the 20th)\n\nEdit bc my toddler hit submit too early:\n\nI still want kids close in age, but I cana't even imagine having sex after this. I feel like I was burned badly. and i want a break from being pregnant. i want to just get so horribly drunk when all this is over, eat sushi, drink all the coffee and eat a shit ton of steak ", "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "ttcafterloss", "subreddit_id": "t5_34scd", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Intro: I'm so lost [TW Stillbirth in process]", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/ttcafterloss/comments/5iblp0/intro_im_so_lost_tw_stillbirth_in_process/"}, {"author": "bones_27", "author_created_utc": 1448262915, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_text": null, "author_fullname": "t2_sbk2y", "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1481741729, "domain": "self.ttcafterloss", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/ttcafterloss/comments/5iceo2/psa_beetroot_is_a_troll/", "gilded": 0, "id": "5iceo2", "is_self": true, "locked": false, "media_embed": {}, "num_comments": 3, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/ttcafterloss/comments/5iceo2/psa_beetroot_is_a_troll/", "retrieved_on": 1484402431, "score": 13, "secure_media_embed": {}, "selftext": "Don't eat beetroot.\nUnless you plan to remember the next time you go to pee that it will in all likelihood be red...\n\nNearly jumped off the toilet this morning and had to go get a calm down hug from husband.

The clinician couldn't explain what that meant. 20% activity? a 2.0 on quality?  20% sounds way below average, a 2.0 is average) \n66% abnormal shape (doctor looks for  &lt;50%). \n\nClinic is saying he should be referred to a urologist, but then if you look online all those values are in the normal range but the activity if that's a %. Just all kind of near the bottom.  We'll get detailed results in the mail next week.  \n\nI'm not sure what to make of it.  I actually find it kind of comforting, it looks like an explanation of why we can get pregnant but also an explanation for why it's taking a bit longer than I hoped. Kind of grasping at straws of meaning, the illusion of control. \n\n\nI'm also pretty unsure any of this can be treated and we're definitely not ready to move to IUI, and our insurance doesn't cover infertility unless it's a medical condition. So far insurance has been good at covering diagnosis and Rx treatment for impotence and I'm still not convinced these aren't correlated. \n\nSo I'm not really sure where this leaves us. This \"what now?\" feeling is why I wanted to wait on the SA but husband really wanted it done and well, it's his sperm.

After seeing a number of different OBGYN's and midwives from 2 states and 3 different practices, it wasn't until we met with a Reproductive Endocrinologist that this condition was even mentioned. I had never heard of it in all my research.\n\nLong story short, it took a saline ultrasound (ouch, btw) and a pelvic MRI to confirm that I have a septum in my uterus. The RE explained to us that this causes miscarriage because when the embryo implants to the septum part (which looks and acts like a normal uterine lining), there is not enough blood flow and the baby eventually dies. This also explains why the chromosome tests on baby #1 came back normal. Unfortunately we were not able to test the others.\n\nAnyway, I will need surgery to remove the septum, and then we can TTC. I should be scheduled for surgery within the next 6 weeks. I wanted to post this to ask if anyone has had similar experience, because I refuse to Google, for once in my life. And also, I wanted to share because I had never heard of this before and had I known, maybe I would have advocated a lot sooner to get tested for this specific condition. \n\nEvery doctor kept telling us its probably just bad luck, even with testing most people don't find a cause, keep trying, blah blah blah. I can't imagine if we had just kept trying and kept miscarrying.

My doctor booked me in with an OBGYN which was a 3 month wait. I found out 10 days before my appointment that I, by some miracle, was pregnant. I called the obgyn to ask if I should come in just in case and the receptionist rudely told me no and cancelled my appointment. I started to miscarry the day after my scheduled appointment.\n\n \n\nIt took another 4 months before I could get into the obgyn again. By this time, we had been trying for over a year. I was told to get CD3 and CD21 blood work done, and my husband was to get an SA. CD3 and SA were done right away, but I could not make it to CD21. The first tests came back astounding, so my obgyn sent me for and HSG, and told me to get CD21 done when I can. This is the 4th cycle since he told me to get the blood work done. I never made it past CD19.\n\n \n\nI had my HSG done 1.5 weeks ago, and both tubes were clear. All that is left is CD21 blood work.

I have been so afraid of jinxing it, that I was scared to say anything to anyone. At this point I don't even care anymore.

I have already booked my follow up appointment to go over the results. \n\n \n\nIt is not until the end of January, but at this point I am just so happy that I will have answers.

My regular OB-Gyn had referred me to multiple high risk doctors during the course of pregnancy for consultations. Anyways, when my regular doctor saw me after miscarriage, she discussed about the situation and in the end mentioned that she'll understand if I decide to pick another doctor and not come to see her after this for next steps. She said many patients chose to change doctors, as the place and people remind them of bad things. I did not think about it much then, it was the day of my miscarriage and a lot was going on in my head.\n\nI did not think about changing my Ob-GYN, my thinking was she already has all my history and the knowledge of all the complications I went thru, so it may be easy for her to take my case forward. \n\nSince then I have visited her twice and I don't feel comfortable.  Every time I see her, she says \"I hope I will see you again sometime\".  Every question I ask about Firborid, pain, recovery is ignored. She has recommended surgery to remove fibroid, but is not doing it herself due to \"complexity\".  She has suggested a few names I can consult for next steps. (and it is not a referral).\n\nAnybody else have experience with similar situation? I am quite confused if this is how the system works or she just wants to deal with the \"happy path\" only ... treating pregnant women and delivering normal babies.

I wanted to bring this to the attention of someone else that might be having this issue because I think I have it and it took me a year to come across this.\nThe basic idea is that there are some women that are so fertile, get pregnant so easily, but at the same time are so prone to early chemicals and pregnancy loss due to poor quality embryos (that would otherwise be rejected by non-super/hyper fertile people) being allowed to implant resulting in a temporary pregnancy. :( \nI thought this idea was very interesting as I am searching for answers.\n From what I am reading, the TREATMENT for super fertility is just progesterone pessaries starting from 7 DPO (which I feel might be late. I think you should start at 3-5 DPO) and then every once in a while a healthy embryo is going to stick and you will just have a happy healthy pregnancy without treatment. \n\nSome links:\n1) BBC News Article: http://www.bbc.com/news/health-19361432\n\"Prof Nick Macklon, a consultant at the Princess Anne Hospital, said: \"Many affected women feel guilty that they are simply rejecting their pregnancy.\n\"But we have discovered it may not be because they cannot carry, [but] it is because they may simply be super-fertile, as they allow embryos which would normally not survive to implant.\"\n\n2) Blog post: https://projectsweetpea.wordpress.com/2013/08/30/the-new-clinic-part-1-the-trials-and-tribulations-of-the-super-fertile/\n\n3) Another blog post: https://frankieslegacy.wordpress.com/2015/04/19/coming-to-terms-with-having-hyper-fertility/\nThis blog post listed Hyper Fertility Markers:\n\"\n- Periods often start at a very young age, usually around 9-10 years old.\n\n- Cycles are textbook regular, always 27-28 days in duration.\n\n- After a miscarriage up to 24 weeks, periods often return exactly 28 days later after the miscarriage occurs.\n\n- After a stillbirth or full term pregnancy (post 24 weeks) locia (bleeding) occurs for up to 2 weeks or more. With hyper fertility locia will last a week to ten days, and periods will return exactly 27-28 days later from the last day of locia occurring. The only exception to this is if the mother breastfeeds post-partum.\n\n- There is no natural decline of egg quality or egg reserves with age. A woman in her early 40\u2019s will typically have egg quality and an egg reserve of someone in their early to mid 30\u2019s. AMH and FSH blood tests will detect egg quality and egg reserves.\n\n- The lining of the womb in a woman with hyper fertility will need to be brought back to optimum levels by using progesterone pessaries, typically 200mg, from day 21 of her cycle if she is trying to conceive. She should take a pregnancy test at 27-28 days and if the test is negative, stop the pessaries in order for her period to start. If she tests positive, she should up the dose to anything from 400mg to 800mg. A mild dose or course of steroids can also help prepare the lining of the womb for a pregnancy to implant successfully.\n\n- A woman with hyper fertility will often experience losses at a very early stage after implantation, typically 7-10 days after finding out she is pregnant if she is testing for pregnancy using today\u2019s sophisticated early tests. This is due to the lining of the womb being over stimulated and the embryo not being able to implant, attach and grow successfully.\n\n- Occasionally, even without treatment, the lining of a woman\u2019s womb some months will allow implantation to occur and a pregnancy to develop normally.\"\n\nAnyone heard of this or think they have this?

I'd appreciate anyone's thoughts on what I should ask.\n\nA bit of background - \n\n1 - About 9 months ago we had our first loss -  a missed miscarriage. The baby probably died between 6 and 7 weeks, we found out around week 10 and used misoprostol to start the actual miscarriage at week 11. After this, I had a bit of testing done. We found and treated subclinical hypothyroidism and vitamin D deficiency. Found out that I'm a carrier for the C677T MTHFR mutation and my husband is a carrier for the A1298C MTHFR mutation, so we both started trying to avoid folic acid and switched our vitamins to ones with methylfolate.\n\n2 - We waited a couple months to try again. Once we started trying, we conceived very quickly but lost the baby between 4 and 5 weeks. Blood tests showed very low progesterone post-peak, so my doctor recommended taking progesterone suppositories. \n\n3-4  We conceived two more times and lost them between weeks 4 and 5 again. More testing showed that high prolactin (probably left over from the first miscarriage) was probably keeping my progesterone low. My doctor recommended treating the high prolactin with a drug called cabergoline to see if that helped. \n\n5 - We conceived again the first cycle using cabergoline. The initial HCG numbers for the baby were great - on P+15 and P+17 (4 weeks 1 day and 3 days) the numbers were 450 and 1100, so really good doubling. This was much different than our chemical pregnancies, where the numbers were almost always falling by the time I'd missed my period. On P+21 (5 weeks), HCG was only 2000 though, so doubling had really slowed. And on P+23, two days later, HCG had fallen back to 450, confirming miscarriage. I started bleeding about a week later at 6 weeks.\n\nI've had some other testing done too, but for the most part, it's all shown that I'm in good health:\n\n* Ultrasound to check for structural abnormalities, ovarian cysts, etc. Everything looked good.\n\n* Hormones - Checked LH, FSH, estrogen, progesterone, testosterone, and prolactin at various points in my cycle. Aside from high prolactin after the first miscarriage, everything has looked normal.\n\n* Autoimmune issues - We started by checking for Hashimotos, an autoimmune issue that is the most common cause of hypothyroidism. This involves testing for thyroid peroxidase antibodies, thyrogloblobulin antibodies, and a few others. Nothing was even slightly elevated. Also tested for rheumatoid factor, the ana ifa screening test, and HS CRP (marker for some autoimmune issues).\n\n* Blood clotting - Cardiolipin AB (IGA, IGG, IGM), Protein C and Protein S, Prothrombin (Factor 2), Lupus anti-coagulant, Anti-thrombin III activity and antigen, Factor V (Leiden). Everything was well within range.\n\n* Adrenal problems - We tested for these after ruling out Hashimotos, because they can also cause thyroid problems. Tested Hydroxyprogesterone, Androstendedione.\n\n* Genetic problems - My husband was really worried about genetic issues, but without strong family history our insurance doesn't cover testing. My doctor recommend 23&amp;me for general screening. It didn't flag anything so we haven't pursued further testing.\n\nWe're having trouble deciding whether we should keep looking for problems or just give up and hope that we'll eventually get lucky. On one hand, we know that any of these losses, maybe even all of them, could have been chromosomal and out of our control.
