Memorial Day weekend, I experienced severe abdominal cramping and bleeding, so I called the emergency nurse line at my OB and was immediately put in contact with my doctor. By Tuesday afternoon my husband and I were in for a transvaginal ultrasound and learned I was on week 7 of an ectopic pregnancy. Baby was 5mm and had a heartbeat. A whirlwind of hospital check-ins, Covid tests, blood tests, and a laparoscopic salpingectomy later, I was home and devastated.\n\nToday, I had my post-Salpingectomy appointment, and I had a LOT of questions. My doctor was patient and thorough with her answers, and I thought I might share them here, as I left feeling much better about my situation. \n\nDISCLAIMER: Everyone\u2019s body and situation is different, and I\u2019m not a medical professional, this is just what my OB told me.\n\nI am exactly one week post-op, and still have quite a bit of bruising, but my incisions \u201clook perfect.\u201d I asked about the \u201cnew\u201d bruises (ones that appeared over the weekend, as I got to be more mobile and sitting up) and she said that it wasn\u2019t internal bleeding like i feared, but that sometimes with incisions and swelling, additional blood vessels will pop between the abdominal wall and the dermis. So don\u2019t freak out if you\u2019re more bruised and tender, but have no other scary symptoms! I also popped some in my eye, though she thinks that was from anesthesia (or rather my waking up from it.)\n\nI asked how long this period-like bleeding would last and she said 2 weeks or until my hormones evened out. It\u2019s not a real period, but my uterus having a \u201cpregnancy withdrawal\u201d as the hormones even out and the uterine lining is shed. \n\nI asked when my REAL period would be and she said it could be in 2 weeks or 8 weeks, depending on my hormones and when they decide it\u2019s time to ovulate again. 14 days (roughly) after that, my period should start. She said we didn\u2019t have to wait to start trying again if we felt emotionally that we would like to get back to it. The first period is good enough to give her a date, and to use the LH strips like normal until we see ovulation. She didn\u2019t recommend trying immediately (before the first period) because a.) I\u2019m still healing, and b.) it would make date tracking difficult.\n\nI asked if she thought an HSG would be beneficial to see if the remaining tube was functional. She said that judging by the pictures taken in surgery, the tube and uterus look healthy and normal, and an HSG would only tell us if the tube was blocked (assuming it didn\u2019t spasm during the dye test) and even then it wouldn\u2019t tell us if a.) the cilia were functioning properly inside to sweep the egg down to the uterus or b.) if I was likely to have another ectopic. She said if it would put my mind at ease, she would do it, but it might be less stressful to just continue to try naturally.\n\nSince we are going to keep trying, I asked what the protocol is now if we get pregnant again. She said to call IMMEDIATELY when we get a positive and they\u2019ll start ordering blood tests every two days. Once the positive is in, the levels climb pretty quick, so we\u2019d be checking to see when we reach 2000 HGC. Then they\u2019ll do an ultrasound to see if the sac is there and where it should be. If it is, we hang tight til 6-7 weeks to see if the heart beat develops. If it does, hooray!\n\nSo here\u2019s some numbers and facts she threw at me about ectopics and being down to one tube:\n\n1.) If you only have one tube and both ovaries, your chances of an egg meeting sperm only go down by 15 percent! This is because ovaries aren\u2019t actually connected to the Fallopian tubes! Think of them as little vacuum hoses that suck up an egg rather than a direct laundry chute. The solo ovary can still send a matured egg toward the remaining tube! Also you need both ovaries to make sure your hormones operate normally, so if it wasn\u2019t damaged, there\u2019s no need to remove it.\n\n2.) if you\u2019ve had an ectopic pregnancy, your chances of it happening again are only 10%. Now that we\u2019ve seen what the remaining tube looks like, she\u2019s optimistic it won\u2019t happen again (90% likely it won\u2019t, if you\u2019re an optimist)\n\n3.) 65% of women with ectopic pregnancies fall pregnant within 18 months and go on to have healthy babies. You\u2019re not out of it yet, mama!\n\nIf you want to know more and are an obsessive googler like me, I found [The Ectopic Pregnancy Trust](https://ectopic.org.uk/patients/what-is-an-ectopic-pregnancy/) to have a lot of good information and support.", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "ttcafterloss", "subreddit_id": "t5_34scd", "subreddit_subscribers": 7438, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "[cross-posted, TW: Ectopic Pregnancy] Uplifting Post-Op", "total_awards_received": 0, "treatment_tags": [], "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/ttcafterloss/comments/gw6cvu/crossposted_tw_ectopic_pregnancy_uplifting_postop/"}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "AutoModerator", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_6l4z3", "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_premium": true, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1591254535, "domain": "self.ttcafterloss", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/ttcafterloss/comments/gwceg7/ttcafterloss_daily_discussion_thread_1_june_04/", "gildings": {}, "id": "gwceg7", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 4, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/ttcafterloss/comments/gwceg7/ttcafterloss_daily_discussion_thread_1_june_04/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1591254539, "score": 1, "selftext": "**How are you doing today?

Just discovered the subreddit and I'm so grateful. Hubby and I were TTC for 3 months when I found out I was pregnant on Memorial Day (5/25/2020.) A week later, June 1, I miscarried. I only bled for about 3 days and it wasn't very heavy. More painful emotionally and physically. I'm still in shock over it all. It happened so fast. I only got to experience being pregnant for a week, and even then the symptoms started to fade after a few days. My tests weren't strong positives and I started to worry. I called Dr. and was told by the nurse not to worry until there was spotting/blood. Anyway... the reason I am positing is because I am seeing so much conflicting information.\n\nSome people TTC again right away, I was told by the doctor I saw (not normal OB, she is on vacation this and I saw an old school guy) to wait at least until August. I'm 35 now and will be 36 in August. Hubby and I hate that we are told to wait. The Dr. told me that I have an increased chance of miscarrying again if I got pregnant right away. He also said \"But if it happens, it happens. We can't stop you from getting pregnant.\" So I just don't know what to do. I want to get pregnant again as soon as I can, but I don't want to lose another baby. My loss was so early in pregnancy that I believe I started to lose it as soon as I found out about it. **Has anyone been in this situation before?** I am asking because a search brought back stuff from 5 years ago. I haven't seen anything more recent. Maybe I should call my usual OB and talk to her?? Are we more fertile after a miscarriage or no? Are the chances of miscarriages higher after one or not?

I've written about our experience over on the r/NIPT sub in case the backstory is helpful.  I posted here before looking for a sub that is explicitly for pre-TMFR, and many of you were helpful to suggest that this would be the right forum, regardless of our future reproductive plans (we're not sure we would TTC after all this - we have two LC).  \n\nOne would think this month has given us the gift of time to come to the right decision for our baby and our family, and in some ways, the time has allowed us to turn over every emotional and intellectual stone.  But it has also placed us in the most excruciating version of limbo where day-to-day and moment-to-moment our decision on whether to TMFR could go either way.  \n\nWe \\*finally\\* received a final result a few days ago and it's the least severe of the possibilities.  But it's still a syndrome with lifelong implications that range from mild to severe (severity of the syndrome can't be known ahead of birth), and various additional unknowns that we simply can't test for ahead of birth (whether low-level mosaicism may still exist despite a few cultured amnio cells showing it doesn't, whether parental recessive disorders that can't be tested for will be present in the child, as they apparently can be with this syndrome due to the chromosomal issues).  Although rare, we have a fairly good grasp from the limited clinical reviews and a handful of other family's experiences on what it means for birth and the early years, and it's not going to be pretty.  Of course, the mild to severe range will influence that early experience.  But suffice to say, it will require a lot of intervention in the form of specialist appointments, evaluations, therapies, possibly (daily) growth hormone injections from an early age, etc.  It appears that they can \"outgrow\" some of the early issues, but try as we might, there is very limited data on what this syndrome means for their future as an older child, teenager, and adult.  We simply don't know whether they will go on to live independently, pursue higher education, have meaningful employment, enjoy romantic relationships, parent children, etc.  \n\nWhen we received the diagnosis, I found myself wishing it had been the more severe option as our path forward (termination) was clear and we were both at peace with that decision.  \n\nOur form of TMFR is medical induction, and given the final diagnosis, our state will not allow us to do so here as the syndrome is not considered \"lethal.\"  We've found a hospital one state over that will take us, but due to gestational age we need to complete the procedure by next Saturday (one week from now).  As our continued sh\\*t luck would have it, they need us to start the process on Monday, which means we need to take a decision in the next 24 hours and then make logistical plans to get ourselves there, arrange accomodation, childcare for our two LC, etc.  \n\nHas anyone in this group been faced with a TMFR decision where you could go either way? How did you make what feels like an impossible decision?  On the other side of it (wether you ultimately TMFR or didn't), do you feel that you made the right decision?  There isn't a life-threatening element to their condition, but there's also no guarantee on quality of life.  My heart says keep, but my head says TMFR.  My partner feels the same way, and we simply don't know how to get to a decision in the next 24 hours that we can live with.", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "ttcafterloss", "subreddit_id": "t5_34scd", "subreddit_subscribers": 7462, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Need to make TMFR decision in coming days... currently in all-consuming agony", "total_awards_received": 0, "treatment_tags": [], "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/ttcafterloss/comments/gxxaov/need_to_make_tmfr_decision_in_coming_days/"}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "PersimmonOrange", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_5c6gb7rw", "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_premium": false, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1591473612, "domain": "self.ttcafterloss", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/ttcafterloss/comments/gxxxrd/spotting_after_exercise/", "gildings": {}, "id": "gxxxrd", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 2, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/ttcafterloss/comments/gxxxrd/spotting_after_exercise/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1591473615, "score": 1, "selftext": "We lost our pregnancy at 19 weeks on March 2.

A member of r/pregnancyafterloss directed me here. My husband and I were given the sad news on Tuesday last week that I had miscarried over the weekend. I had been to see my OBGYN on Thursday where we saw the heartbeat at 6W6D. After a trip to the ER on Saturday for spotting and light cramps we were calmed down by seeing the heartbeat again at 7W1D. We were told to go to my OBGYN after the weekend to make sure all was still good. Unfortunately things were not all good and she could no longer find the heartbeat. I was diagnosed with a MMC and told to go to the hospital to schedule my D&amp;C. It was planned for Friday but I ended up miscarrying naturally on Wednesday night. This morning I just finished up at my OBGYN and my HCG is down to less than 5. I am spotting very very lightly but physically I am feeling much better since last week. I am also very grateful I was able to spare myself the D&amp;C. We have been given the ok to try and conceive again whenever we want to. As my cycle was already very irregular it doesn\u2019t make much sense to wait for my period to show up when it might not.\n\nWe are trying to remain positive and are eager to start TTC. I\u2019ve decided I am going to give OPK and HPT a rest for a little while. I want to just try and enjoy having sex with my husband again and keep the process fun and stress free. \n\nI\u2019ve come here hoping for some success stories. How long did it take for you to conceive again? When did you start trying again? How soon after a natural miscarriage did you ovulate? Looking for all the good vibes and happy stories right now. \ud83d\udc9b", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "ttcafterloss", "subreddit_id": "t5_34scd", "subreddit_subscribers": 7478, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Searching for positivity", "total_awards_received": 0, "treatment_tags": [], "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/ttcafterloss/comments/gz187z/searching_for_positivity/"}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "goataddict", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_template_id": "b22615aa-711f-11e4-97ba-12313b0e92a7", "author_flair_text": "22 week D&E, 5/20/2020", "author_flair_text_color": "dark", "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_37mf137t", "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_premium": false, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1591635359, "domain": "self.ttcafterloss", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/ttcafterloss/comments/gz32pn/ttc_after_tfmr/", "gildings": {}, "id": "gz32pn", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 14, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/ttcafterloss/comments/gz32pn/ttc_after_tfmr/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1591784969, "score": 3, "selftext": "I've been searching through posts on here and was wondering if anyone was given concrete reasons for the recommended amount of time their OB told them to wait to TTC again?

The OB nurse told me to just listen to my body and if it happens before I even have a cycle it's not uncommon.\n* I was told by the surgeon they normally do a 6 week follow up, but since I would have to drive 3 hours they recommended scheduling with my normal OB. Again, my OB said it wasn't necessary unless I wanted it. I just want to make sure I'm healed and there are no residuals, but I've read 6 weeks might be longer than necessary. \n* I can't seem to find an agreement on returning to exercise after the d&amp;e, resuming sex, swimming.  Obviously, I'd listen to my body, but I'd like to get back to exercising and swimming before 2 weeks if possible. \n\nI'm sure I'll get post op instructions that are clearer, but it's annoying me I can't get concrete answers. I want to be able to heal physically as soon as possible and try to move forward mentally and emotionally. Part of this includes being in good shape and mentally healthy when we can start trying again.

Its only there when I wipe so its not even enough to warrant a tampon,  maybe a very thin liner if that. I'm still 9 days out from my monthly so there's no way this is an early period , I'm extremely regular in that sense .\n\n\nMy question is has anyone experienced something similar to this ? Has it resulted in a pregnancy or could something else be going on ? This is the first time it has ever happened , I didn't even had any bleeding from my first pregnancy since it was a missed miscarriage. I don\u2019t wanna get my hopes up but according to the internet I'm either pregnant or I got cancer .

I found so much love and support here, and it turned a down day into a better one.  If you are similarly feeling down and unsure whether to vent or not, I encourage you to do so - I was even thinking about deleting this post when I first wrote it, but I'm glad I didn't.  This sub is here for you xx\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nPlease note, before you read on, I do not mean to offend anyone by this - this is just how I have been feeling, and wanted to share/see what other people thought.\n\nI was nearly 10w when I learnt I had suffered a MMC.  It was my first pregnancy, very much carefully planned and wanted.\n\nI think back to the very early months of this year where yes, I was impatient and a little anxious, but I was not fearful or angry.  Now I feel that what has happened has caused my internal catatonic plates to shift, and has it has caused a rift, revealing a river of lava inside me - I have a low-grade throb of anger and upset with me all the time, and it's so tiring.  Sometimes it's barely there and I almost feel totally fine; other times it's very strong and overwhelming.\n\nI don't want to feel this way.  I can't/don't even use word 'b--y' when it comes to describing what happened to me because I find it so triggering.  For me, if I could submit to a procedure where I could just remove all those memories (cf. Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind) and be back in that place where I was at the beginning, I would.  I don't want to remember, and I don't want to have gone through this.\n\nOn one hand, having gone through this experience means that I can relate to the wonderful, brave, resilient women like yourselves, but on the other, it causes me a lot of pain and anxiety (why did it happen?  will it happen again?) that I would rather not have.  I only feel safe here and in the MC sub - I don't think I can ever go back to TFAB where most are so naive to this, and will remain that way.\n\nI often feel fraudulent - I try and boost up others and tell them that things will be OK, reassure them that in the vast majority of cases these things are just bad genetic luck - but even though I hear my words, it doesn't quell these feelings.  I will say the one time I do feel any peace is when I'm trying to help others, as it takes my mind off myself.\n\nI try and count my 'blessings' - I know we are not meant to compare losses, but I feel 'lucky' that mine happened when it did, I can't imagine being someone who is much further along than I was, and has to go through this for whatever reason.  Against all odds during this pandemic, I was able to get surgery so I never had to 'see' anything.  Everything seemed to go well in terms of my recovery.  I'm grateful that I was even able to get pregnant in the first place in that at least me and my husband's bits 'work'.\n\nRegardless, I still feel hollow - like I'm looking at the pieces of a smashed vase and saying 'Well, at least they are big enough so I can glue them back together'.\n\nI'm sorry - this is a real rant, but I just feel particularly hopeless today, I don't know why.  I might delete this later :(  Please tell me how you get through these feelings.

I would really like to try as soon as we can instead of waiting for a full cycle as I don\u2019t see any evidence to support either advises (wait or to not wait).  However, I am extremely scared that I might miscarry again because my uterus won\u2019t be able to support the baby, this will honestly break my husband and I.
