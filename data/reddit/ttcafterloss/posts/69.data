Unfortunately, while we were hoping it would turn out benign, my symptoms escalated yesterday morning to the point I had horrific cramping and was passing massive clots - at one point every 10-15 minutes, filling up pads by the hour or sooner.\n\nI knew it wasn't good when we went for ultrasounds and there was no mention of viability from the tech (although held out hope it was only because it was the doctor's role to do so). I knew just before they told us as, originally when the cramps got bad, I'd been given a low dose of morphine with reassurance that \"it wouldn't harm the baby\" and then hours later, they doubled my dose without a word of a baby or risk.\n\nAnd then our doctor broke the news. There was no heartbeat. Our little \"snowman\", as we'd dubbed him/her from the adorable snowman shape on our sonogram where we heard their beautiful heartbeat for the first time, was gone. Later a nurse would ask first we were at 8 weeks and when we clarified 10, she mentioned apparently our baby didn't look like it had developed much past 8. This was horrendously sad news.\n\nWe're absolutely heartbroken. We do hope to continue to try as we feel ready, physically and emotionally. We were so ready to have our own little family, still ready in spirit to have our own little baby.\n\nI'm already planning some tentative timelines for conception, but it's also so much waiting for my body to heal and see what unfolds. I can only try as my body allows me.\n\nAnd even physically, I'm nervous for what this means for me. We got reassurance that this is common, that our loss doesn't mean we will continue to have problems ahead, but I would be lying if I wasn't nervous. Again, fresh off our loss, but it's still been traumatic and we won't easily push this aside.\n\nI remain hopeful as we move into our new lives post-miscarriage, as we look towards trying again once we've healed enough in body and spirit.

I took out some decorations and immediately found two decorations she had made in art class. I know somewhere in my boxes of ornaments is one she bought for me that says \"Mom\" on it, and an ornament we gave to her that says \"Our first Christmas as a family\" with all of our names on it. I don't know what to do with these. I can't throw them away, but I can't bring myself to put them up either. She was our kid.

My husband and I started TTC in August, and got pregnant on our first cycle! We were over the moon excited! We began planning for our first baby and thinking about all things pregnancy, birth, and nursery. That pregnancy, unfortunately, ended in a miscarriage. I started bleeding around 6 weeks, and my miscarriage was confirmed when I was 7 weeks by HCG quantitative testing. My levels were too low for how far along I was, and they kept dropping. Fortunately, my body passed everything naturally.\n\nAfter our miscarriage, we called and told our families about the miscarriage. My MIL shared her experience with several miscarriages before successfully having my husband. She mentioned that when she was pregnant with his younger sister, she found out she had a Robertsonian Translocation (RT). She mentioned to us that my husband might also be a carrier. At first, I was upset, since she didn't tell us BEFORE we started TTC, but then I launched into research mode and began looking into RT and asked my OB's office to run the karyotype testing. \n\nWe went to our hospital's lab and got 2 vials of blood drawn each, it was a very simple blood test. We got the results about a week later that my husband has a balanced Robertsonian Translocation on chromosomes 14 &amp; 21. I was devastated by the news. All of the research I had done seemed to indicate high risk of miscarriage, high risk of a child being born with Down syndrome, and IVF with PGD seemed like the only option. My OB's office set us up with an appointment with the MFM Genetics team to discuss what our results mean and what our options are.\n\nAfter an excruciating 6 week wait for our appointment, we finally met with the genetics counselor and high risk OB this week. It was really helpful for her to describe in detail what RT was and what our true odds are. Since my husband is the carrier, fortunately, our odds are better than if I was the carrier. **DISCLAIMER** While these odds may not be right for everyone in our situation, I figured posting it may help people, like me, who were searching for some answers before their follow-up with genetics. See a genetic counselor if you suspect you or your partner might have a translocation or other genetic issue.\n\nIf Male carrier of RT 14:21,\n\u2022 Odds of miscarriage are 33%\n\u2022 Odds of having a baby born with Down syndrome are 1%\n\nThe genetic specialist recommended us to continue trying naturally to get pregnant. She reports that in her experience, most couples in our situation go on to have a healthy child relatively quickly. She did discuss assisted reproduction options such as IVF with PGD as well as IUI with donor sperm. She said these are less common and most couples end up successfully conceiving naturally. \n\nThis was a huge weight off of our shoulders. Our odds are still higher than average for miscarriage, but we are looking forward to trying for our rainbow baby after the holidays.\n\nThanks for reading!

Usually if your levels are at 5000+ they don't recommend the MTX shot because there is less chance it will work. However, my doctor gave it to me at 9 weeks pregnant when my levels were in the 9000s.\n\nOct 16, 2018 (9 weeks pregnant) - 9000s (did not get exact number because it was in the ER). Received two shots of MTX\n\nOct 23, 2018- 4746\n\nOct 30, 2018- 1656\n\nNov 6, 2018 - 839\n\nNov 13, 2018 - 432\n\nNov 20, 2018 - 226\n\nNov 27, 2018 - 70\n\nDec 4, 2018 - 22\n\nDec 11, 2018 - 3 (Less than 5 is considered 0 or not pregnant)\n\nSo, that took a total of 8 weeks to go from 9000s down to 0. It was a long and tedious process, very painful emotionally, but now this gives closure to move on. I am genuinely happy that I can begin to take care of myself physically (Can start eating healthy foods with folate, and workout again) and prepare my body for the next time we start trying for a baby. \n\nIf I can take away any positive from this experience, it is that I refuse to take my body for granted, and promise to nourish it with only good things (I really noticed how badly I felt these past two months not being able to eat anything healthy since almost everything has folic acid in it and not being able to workout). I also know I will not take pregnancy for granted, and will appreciate everything that comes my way. I yearn for the morning sickness, bloating, and everything else I was denied this pregnancy. I will appreciate all of it when I get pregnant with my next baby.

Mainly due to the spikes of temps in luteal phase and slow rise of temps during O. He said this is causing weak ovulation. He suggested I skip a month of TTC, try to correct my cycle, and then try the next month. He also said my lack of EWCM suggests poor quality and that needs to be fixed before trying again. \n\nTo be honest, I had a slight panic attack after hearing endo. I never suspected that as the only time I have pain is the first day of period with cramps. They are sometimes a level 8 in pain but when I take pain relief like Tylenol, it\u2019s very manageable. I wouldn\u2019t consider my periods heavy at all.

My baby girl was stillborn in early August at 39wks, 4 days.  I had a completely normal pregnancy, a normal 39 week checkup, and two days later I started what seemed like normal labor (I have a 2 year-old and a 3 year-old, no previous complications or losses, and this labor seemed exactly the same). My husband and I arrived at the hospital expecting to meet our 3rd and last baby within a few hours but instead the nurses and doctors couldn't find a heartbeat. We were completely blindsided and devastated. \n\nLess than 3 hours later I delivered a beautiful and seemingly perfect but sleeping 8lb 7oz baby girl. We declined an autopsy because I couldn't bear the thought of it, and her cord was wrapped extremely tightly around her neck two times. My doctor explained that the most likely scenario was that everything was fine leading up to labor, but when my contractions started and she began lowering, the cord tightened until she asphyxiated.\n\nThere are so many things that I could describe as \"the worst part\" of all this. I feel so much emptiness, anger, sadness, and jealousy. Everyone tells me how lucky I am to have my 2 older children (and they do bring me so much joy), but that doesn't mean I didn't want HER. That I didn't need HER. My SIL had a baby just a few days before mine was born, and being around them is such a devastating reminder of exactly what's missing. We're a close family, but the feelings of jealousy and anger are extremely difficult to deal with, especially during the holidays. They showed up for trick or treat with the baby wearing the same pumpkin hat I had bought for my daughter, but mine was of course still in the nursery closet, tag still on. My FIL has an annoying habit of plopping the baby unexpectedly into my lap, completely oblivious to the fact that it takes me hours to prepare myself to be able to hold any baby, much less the one that I so closely associate with the one that I lost. \n\nDespite how incredibly hard this has been, my husband and I decided we wanted to try again pretty much immediately. We were lucky to get pregnant in October after waiting two cycles. I had appropriately rising HCGs during week 4 and saw a strong heartbeat at 6.5 weeks. Then one morning around 8 weeks I started spotting. The next day an ultrasound revealed there was no heartbeat and the baby was measuring about a week behind. I had a d&amp;c on 12/7.\n\nI think we're going to wait at least a cycle or two before trying again. I'm looking at the urn containing my daughter and am just so sad that instead of holding a chubby and smiley 4 month-old, I'm mourning the loss of both her and what I thought was my rainbow baby.\n\nBoth in the aftermath of my stillbirth and now I am so grateful to everyone here who is willing to share the details of their experiences, both practical and emotional. The information here helped me get through my first TTC cycle, helped me make the decision to go with a d&amp;c, and has helped me feel less alone through it all.

He was born and died abroad (I was living and working in another country at the time). We scattered his ashes in a public garden in one of the capital cities of Southern Europe. I have a handmade blanket, a small slipper-shoe, and a book as artifacts, but not much else. The experience radically changed my world view, and I'd say even my personality to an extent. I started therapy right away (good life decision!) and continue going to this day. \n\nI actively avoided having another child in the years following Andrea, mostly because I was very focused on my career and my dating life was tepid at best. I'm still a career lady, and I live in one of the biggest metropolises in the USA with my two little dogs. I decided to take the plunge and have a baby on my own and am working with a known-donor (so, it's mostly regular ol' sex with a little bit of artificial at-home insemination).\n\nWhile there's nothing in my journey to indicate that I'll have trouble conceiving (good test results, I'm pretty young, etc.) it often feels so out of reach for me. I can't imagine getting a BFP, having a baby, and having him live. \n\nI've found that \"real life\" people are remarkably uncomfortable talking about this type of loss, especially years later, and I tend to avoid it lest I receive a negative or inappropriate reaction (I've had many... to many to list).\n\nSince beginning my TTC journey, I've had surgery to remove some polyps and am currently taking 4mg progesterone twice daily.

October 24th I came back for my followup which felt very... brief? He sat me down, stuck a finger up there for less than 10 seconds and told me I was good to go.\n\nNow I don't know what to expect because I had never been pregnant, or had a miscarriage before this. I had sort of expected an ultrasound to make sure everything was cleared out, or a blood test to check my HCG was falling or under 5. But the man with the degree didn't seem worried, so I shrugged down my worries and left.\n\nIt's now been 9 weeks since my D&amp;C and about 5 weeks worth of negative FRER pregnancy tests. Each one is a little icepick to the heart. Combine that with my newborn newphew and the winter blues, and I could pretty much eat my weight in boozy ice cream. \n\nSo I called the doctor today finally-- because I kept hoping one of those tests would be positive and I could schedule a new prenatal appointment, instead of a what-is-wrong-with-my-baby-maker appointment. \n\nI explained to the nurse that I hadn't menstruated or had any bleeding since the week of my D&amp;C, and she called me back to tell me that my doctor had filed a prescription for Provera for me.\n\nI kinda feel that maybe I should have at least had a blood test done first. Or an ultrasound to check on things. It feels a little bizarre to have a prescription written for me before those two things were done or I was seen again, but I'm not a doctor. \n\nDid anyone go on Provera for the first time the cycle of their D&amp;C?

I literally haven\u2019t had a period yet or any sign of ovulation.  As far as I know conception isn\u2019t even on the table yet. \n\nI had a full term stillbirth this fall (I feel like there\u2019s been a lot of us lately).  She was my first pregnancy and my husband and I waited a long time before trying to conceive. I\u2019m relatively old for a first timer (30), and I\u2019m feeling more than ever the biological clock ticking... especially now that we have to \u201cstart over\u201d to get our family. I\u2019ve pretty much given up on a family of 5, but I\u2019m worried that we won\u2019t be able to even squeeze in a family of four.  \n\nTonight, my husband shared that he\u2019s not ready to start trying again, and wants to spend more time enjoying what we have.  My problem is that I don\u2019t know how to do that.  I\u2019ve wanted a baby for so long and we came so freaking close.  Like.. nursery-decorated-diapers-stocked- health-insurance-notified close. It feels like giving up or backsliding to pause. \n\nRealistically, even I probably need more time to grieve... but I so badly don\u2019t want to end up in a position where children aren\u2019t even on the table anymore. And just because it was pretty easy for us to conceive last time doesn\u2019t mean that\u2019ll be the case this time.  Secondary infertility is a real thing.\n\nI\u2019m not really asking for advice on how to convince my husband to keep/start trying... I love him too much to put him in a position that he\u2019s not ready for... But if anyone has been in a similar situation I\u2019d love to hear what happened/how things shook out.

We want a child very much but after learning we conceived easily the first time (to my SHOCK) and knowing how awful pregnancy was for me, we wanted to wait a few months at least. \n\nMy d&amp;c was November 7.  It was 8 weeks but measured 6.  I thought I tested out on cheapies by nov. 31. Figured not fertile. Had sex once on dec 2. On a whim took a test December 10. Faint positive. Took a million more. All faint positive, but didn\u2019t get darker in the three days of testing.  My feelings at the positives were SHOCK. Then crying. I was not ready to be pregnant and feel awful and helpless and unable to do anything for myself again so soon. But also thrilled, because of course.\n\nAfter three days of very faint positive but *definitely* there lines on 5 different brands of  pregnancy tests, my blood hcg is 3 and my progesterone is 0.7, which is not pregnant.\n\nI feel very relieved and very sad and very foolish all at the same time and it is a very uncomfortable feeling. I prefer my feelings to happen one at a time.\n\nThe doctor is surprised I got these positive tests at all, but figures they are leftover hormones from the miscarriage. After my miscarriage, I stopped peeing on the cheap test strips when I got the first negative. So I guess probably if I had kept peeing on them, I might have seen very faint lines and negatives fluctuating for a bit longer. I guess? And the two FRERs i got lines on a couple days ago are probably because they can detect as little as 6.5 hcg, and if I was at 3 yesterday, that makes sense I suppose. It may theoretically be possible it was a super early chemical pregnancy but that seems highly unlikely.\n\nI guess my hormonal crying yesterday was just normal emotional crying??\n\nGood news is I feel productive with my Ritalin today and a Catzrgood who can do the things turns into a Happy Catzrgood pretty fast. I will be able to complete my Christmas tasks and enjoy them. Still have the sads and the feeling foolish though. \n\nI\u2019m not sure if this makes me want to be more careful for the next few months or want to start trying sooner than we planned.

The whole feel of the office was much different.  Everyone seemed to know that I wasn't another happy pregnant woman.  My initial appointment was with the NP.  I chatted with her for a while, explained why I was leaving the other doctor's office.  She kept apologizing for the other staff, and even went over old test results with me, she wanted to make sure that I knew what was going on, even if it doesn't have any effect on me now or in the future.  I was never told exactly how far along I was, so she went over that with me too.   She wasn't sure what kind of testing the doctor would order, if he would consider both miscarriages  as related, so she asked if I would like them to SQUEEZE ME IN to see the doctor that morning or if I would like a phone call.  SQUEEZE ME IN!... that day! That's something I never heard from my previous doctor.  It was always \"doctor can't see you until (insert far away date here).  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe doctor explained that my miscarriages (18 weeks and 9 weeks) were unrelated, but I'm still considered high risk due to the late miscarriage.  (Life loves to fuck with me)  He does want us to wait a few months to start trying again. Which was our plan, I'm starting school in January and I'm in a wedding in March (that I would love to be able to drink at).  I'm like a kid though, once I was told that I can't do something, it makes me want it even more.

Looking to expand , we got pregnant after my cycle in October. Had spotting the whole time, never really bought into the pregnancy. I just never felt the baby\u2019s soul , or consciousness , or whatever you want to call it. My husband griped at me for that. Sorry, it\u2019s my mom instinct and I just didnt feel it. Cut to 6 weeks 6 days in &amp; bleeding intensified (mind you, we\u2019d been doing lab draws every 48-72 hrs for 2.5 weeks, no doctor visit even after I requested one since HCG was increasing but very, very slowly) and we unfortunately saw what was surely the embryonic sac or something. A week later , pretty intense pain on left side. Thought it was kidney. Went to ER, and it turned out, ectopic pregnancy in my left Fallopian tube. We were SO lucky that my mother is a nurse and my husband and I are super google freaks or honestly we could have missed it and maybe not gone in until permanent damage had been done to my tube. I\u2019m so frustrated that even after 3 weeks of weird lab draws , spotting , etc that the doctor \u201cwasn\u2019t worried\u201d and refused to do an ultrasound to even check the thickness of my uterine lining. Anyways, ended up getting Metheltrexate (spelling?) to stop any cell division and help clear tube. This is a chemo drug, and is making my life miserable now. I have constipation, mixed with diarrhea (yea, figure that one out) and my guts feel so loose and bloated at the same time, my tummy looks 4 months pregnant from all the inflammation and it\u2019s just terrible. Anyone have experience with Metheltrexate and can share what it was like? Sorry if this is the wrong sub for this....it\u2019s the closest I can find. We are just so thankful for 1) our son 2) the fact we caught it early enough that I didn\u2019t lose the Fallopian tube 3) that my new doctor (you bet your ass I\u2019m NOT going back to the \u201cnot worried about it\u201d guy) seems to genuinely care and will be on top of my pregnancies moving forward.

He was very nice and invited me to come in to talk whenever I needed. Promised that my next pregnancy would be heavily monitored and after 20 weeks I\u2019d have ultrasounds very frequently. \n\nThe long and short of it is my placenta failed to properly implant and proceeded to throw a shit fit, probably once I got out of the first tri. I did not develop the preeclampsia and HELLPS symptoms until a week or so before delivery, once things reached a critical level with the placenta. He said their best theory is I was \u201callergic\u201d to the placenta, but having the same partner again can help mitigate risks of improper implantation. \n\nHe was very firm that I could not have done anything and they had no way to detect the placenta wasn\u2019t working, even if they had been able to there was nothing they could do. My son wouldn\u2019t have survived either way, even if we had been at a hospital with a higher level NICU. If by some miracle he had, his chances of permanent physical and mental disabilities were over 80%. \n\nI am getting further testing to check that I don\u2019t have a clotting disorder and he feels taking aspirin prior to conception would help mitigate some risks. I will, without exception, only every deliver throug c section due to my vertical uterine scarring. \n\nThe bad news: he generally has people wait 9 months between delivery and subsequent pregnancy, but he would like if I waited a year. Great. So I have minimum another 6 months of sitting in the house mourning my loss and watching everyone else move on with their lives. If I wait that long I guess I can forget having a third child before I\u2019m 30. What if I have trouble conceiving?? My husband and I were going to wait until April and maybe start NTNP then but that has in all likelihood been derailed. \n\nWorse news: I am looking at a 50% chance of preeclampsia again; no way to tell how severe it would be, but it\u2019s usually less so. However he said since I was in the top 1% of severity, it makes everything \u201cless severe\u201d. Chances of HELLPS recurring is around 20%. And there\u2019s nothing that can be done to prevent it either, only try to manage symptoms and pray I am at an advanced enough gestation that my next baby doesn\u2019t die too. \n\nTo sum it up, I have to wait what feels like forever to become pregnant again. I will likely see a recurrence of at least one major complication - if this happens, there is the added potential of living, in the hospital, in a major city kilometres away from my home and family for an unknown period of time. Add that to the good chance of preterm delivery and a possible NICU stay; it all makes for a bad morning. \n\nMerry Fucking Christmas to me.

Long story short, I've had a hell of a time working through a miscarriage that occurred in the middle of September.  I lost my little one on the 13th and as of the 26th of November, I was still having elevated hCG draws (8 mIU/mL).  On December 5th, my hCG then raised 4 mIU/mL.  At this point, it was the second time my hCG had risen slightly since the miscarriage, so my doctor told me to just wait it out.  However, I have been having regular periods since October, and I was due to start on December 11th.  Guess who never showed up?  Yep, dear Aunt Flo.  So now, I'm 17/18 dpo with no AF, a slight rise in hCG at what would have been around 7/8 dpo, breast tenderness, and since then, I have taken three of the $.88 Wally-World tests that have all shown faint positives.  To break my heart though, I took an Equate Digital HPT today (four days late), and it came back negative.  I'm crushed.  I can't get in for another blood quant until Wednesday, but I'm curious if anyone else might have a story like this? Or, anybody just have a forever hCG amount after a loss?

All of you are in my thoughts; best wishes to all of you. I was told to post here as many have gone through this experience. \n\nAfter years of dealing with periods that got worse and worse, they eventually made me very sick and anemic. Truthfully, I never knew they were abnormally heavy (why don\u2019t we talk about these things???). Seriously, I\u2019d bleed through a super tampon in &lt;2 hours... I\u2019d even set alarms overnight to change my (double) protection.\n\nI eventually saw my gynecologist who was a bit horrified I had been living with this for so long. We discussed the best birth control options for me (I\u2019m not sexually active, so I don\u2019t need them for contraceptive purposes right now). She wanted to do the Depo, but I wasn\u2019t comfortable with that, so we compromised on starting the pill and moving on to other options as needed.\n\nShe sent me for an ultrasound, which neither one of us expected to show anything abnormal. To my surprise, I got a phone call from the nurse a week later scheduling me a follow up appointment, as my ultrasound showed suspicion for endometrial polyp(s). \n\nI had my appointment, turns out I\u2019m *far* younger (22) than who normally gets them \u2014 my gynecologist has said she\u2019s only seen a handful of 20-somethings have them. She said they don\u2019t *need* to come out, but will do nothing but cause me more issues down the road. I will be having a hysteroscopy with polypectomy and D&amp;C in about a month. It\u2019s supposed to be a fairly quick, outpatient procedure. \n\nShe also is *highly* recommending an IUD, says she can put it in while I\u2019m under. She wants to use Kyleena. I\u2019m hesitant on it, as the side effects make me nervous but I do know everyone reacts different. I wasn\u2019t really excited about it, but as she recommends it so highly, I think I owe it to her to give it a shot. \n\nI have some medical related anxiety, so safe to say I\u2019m a bit worked up about this. I do know it\u2019s a routine procedure that has very little downtime. Part of me is convinced they\u2019ll be cancerous (she said there\u2019s like a 0.01% it *could* be). It\u2019s also scary being in such a vulnerable situation while under anesthesia.\n\nI am looking forward to it, oddly enough. I just can\u2019t wait to get my life back and have my bleeding under control. I\u2019m not even sure I know how to handle a normal period, lol. \n\nHas anyone had a similar experience?

I was not scheduled for a prenatal appointment or ultrasound until 9+3. I was concerned the whole pregnancy that something was wrong (not really for any good reason, but just because I like data and evidence and didn\u2019t have any except for my positive tests). I do/did not have an established relationship with a doctor, so I didn\u2019t feel like I could ask to be seen earlier, nor did I know if that would end up costing me money since maybe it would only be elective and not covered by insurance?\n\nI guess my question is, based on your experience, do you think I can expect to receive more prenatal care if I am able to conceive again? I\u2019d like an earlier visit, and maybe even have betas done, but since it will only be a second pregnancy I\u2019m afraid they\u2019ll treat me just as if it was my first. \n\nOh, and I\u2019m in the US. \n\nThank you so much for any thoughts you may have, this community seems so supportive.

I thought I\u2019d post mine as well, as I think it might help me process and perhaps help someone else too\u2014 super long story ahead.  I\u2019m also wondering about next steps.\n\nMy husband and I just got married back in May after having been together for years, and since we\u2019re in our mid-30s (he\u2019s 36, I\u2019m 33) and want a couple of kids, we thought we\u2019d start trying for our first in the next few months.  I stopped the Nuvaring in early September, figuring we could NTNP as my cycle regulated but since I have no chill and hated not knowing when my period would start after years of regular cycles, I started temping and tracking in October.  This ultimately turned out to be a really good thing as it helped me figure out I was pregnant and in trouble.\n\nOct 30 I got impatient and took a preg test\u2014 negative, figured it was too early.  Nov 1, day after I expected my period to start, took another test\u2014 nope.  I figured I was out, my hormones were still self-regulating and that Sunday, mentioned how annoyed I was to my husband who said \u201cwell.. what if it isn\u2019t coming?\u201d.  That prompted me to take one more test that afternoon, which was positive.  We were so happy and shocked, although trying to be cautious since I know quite a few friends who have miscarried early on.  \n\nI immediately called my obgyn on Mon morning to book an ultrasound and also decided to go to a local health clinic to discuss a blood draw, since I have a form of anemia and wanted to check on whether I should be increasing iron or anything.  While there they took my HCG- 357- and confirmed it was about right for around 4 weeks.\n\nLess than a day later, early morning on Tues I wiped and there was a bit of pink.  I tried to reassure myself that might be normal, but I started brown-spotting more as the day went on, and by the evening it was bright red.  At that point I was feeling sad and told my husband I felt like I was miscarrying.  Thank goodness I had taken the test, though, because any other month I would\u2019ve just thought it was a slightly odd period.  Wednesday morning I kept bleeding bigger clots and started cramping on my left side, so I called the obgyn and they told me to come in for a scan and a blood draw that afternoon.  Nothing on the scan except for uterine lining (was less than 5 weeks at that point, but not even a sac), and HCG was 352.  \n\nI went for a follow-up blood draw Fri morning, assuming and processing that my body was miscarrying naturally since I was still bleeding.  Later that morning the nurse called and asked me to come in that afternoon\u2014 it had gone up to 478 and they mentioned possible ectopic.  I was in disbelief, but went in and the obgyn explained that with HCG rising between Wed and Fri and my symptoms (bleeding, cramping, nothing on ultrasound), she wanted to give me methotrexate to start treating for a possible ectopic.  They didn\u2019t have Mon\u2019s HCG level since that was a different clinic, but once I told her she was even more convinced.  At that point I hadn\u2019t processed what was happening, but got the two shots with instructions to come back on day 4 and 7.\n\nWell, methotrexate was awful.  In addition to now being super anxious about the ectopic, being restricted to basically meat, dairy and white potatoes with a tiny bit of white rice and some lower folate fruit, it made me extremely tired with gastro symptoms, and the lowered immunity resulted in a cold that weekend.\n\nBy Monday night Nov 12, I was feeling a bit more pain esp in my shoulder (around a 5- not unbearable but I wasn\u2019t sure how much pain I\u2019d be in if it ruptured), so my husband and I went to the ER.  Another ultrasound, saw the corpus luteum cyst on my right ovary and a small amount of fluid in the pouch of Douglas.  Since I was supposed to go in for my 4 day draw Tues morning, they took my blood that evening anyway.  I was in a room close to the nurse\u2019s station and overheard her gasp while getting my HCG results over the phone- 1417.   They expected an increase on day 4 but not that much.  After consultation with the obgyn on call and some talk of possible surgery that night, they decided to try another dose of methotrexate since I was generally stable, and to keep me overnight for observation.  I was fine, they released me and I anxiously waited for the Fri blood draw, now even more tired thanks to the second dose.  In between, my bleeding mostly stopped.\n\nFri morning Nov 16 I go to the lab at the hospital for the 7 day draw.  I have super small, deep veins so I\u2019m a hard stick, and the guy tried twice with no luck.  Right after the second try while he was finding someone else to try, I started to black out, get super cold and sweaty (unusual for me, I\u2019d never before fainted at a blood draw nor am I bothered by it).  As I was blacking out I told the lab tech that I had a suspected ectopic and might have to go to the ER, then don\u2019t totally remember what happened.  I do know I was having a hard time fully regaining consciousness after 10 minutes, so they called for the ER and I got wheeled down the hall to get checked out, got another ultrasound and my blood drawn there.  Cyst smaller, less fluid and HCG now 1747- smaller increase so the obgyn thought we could wait till Monday blood draw.  Still no sign of anything else on ultrasound, and once I felt better from fainting I was released.\n\nSpent the weekend in high anxiety/grief mode (hyper vigilant about every feeling now) but hoping against hope that the rates were decreasing, even though I hadn\u2019t bled for days.  Mon morning Nov 19 I decided I needed to try to feel normal so after my blood draw my coworker drove me to work (missed the entire last week due to fatigue and the cold).  \n\nEarly afternoon, I get a call from my obgyn office, and first thing the nurse says is \u201cPlease stop eating or drinking immediately, come in as soon as you can\u201d.  Crap.  HCG now at just under 2200, so it was clear the two doses of mtx didn\u2019t work and I\u2019d need surgery that night\u2014 but they hadn\u2019t even found where the embryo was yet.  Thank goodness for my coworker, who saw me starting to bawl, drove me to the doctor right away and stayed with me until my husband came.  The office did another ultrasound, I told them I still thought it was on my left side given the pains, and they were finally able to find the embryo in my left tube.  \n\nIt was a weird feeling of overwhelming relief that they knew where it was and could do something about it, thankfulness that my tube hadn\u2019t ruptured yet (although the bleeding/cramping restarted after the ultrasound and I came to find out after surgery I had started bleeding in the tube), and anxiety about the surgery (had never had anything more complex than wisdom teeth surgery before).  My obgyn did tell me pre-op that I would lose my tube as they generally remove it completely, and possibly my ovary.\n\nSurgery was thankfully uneventful except for the 4 sticks it took to get an IV in.  I lost my left tube but kept both my ovaries, the obgyn removed some adhesions (not clear on whether they were because of the ectopic or if they existed before), and said my right tube looked healthy.  Post-op, I had bleeding for about 3 days, my hcg dropped to 28 one week after and 3 the week after that. \n\nMy physical pain and scars are subsiding but the emotions and grief hit me hard this week, especially with the holidays coming up- I\u2019d hoped we could announce to our families around Christmas.  I\u2019m trying to take it one day at a time, counting the small victories when I start to feel more like myself each day, but giving myself the space to cry when I need to.  We still need to wait at least 3 months before trying again due to mtx, which is totally fine by me as I\u2019m currently terrified of trying again right away. \n\nI\u2019m curious about a couple of things:\n\nFirst period:  I\u2019m waiting on my first period post surgery to come sometime in the next week, but will be traveling around that time too.  I\u2019ve read it could be crampier and heavier for some\u2014 what was it like for many of you?  \n\nHSG:  I\u2019m debating whether to push for an HSG test for my remaining tube early next year.  I just thought it was weird that I ovulated from my right ovary but the embryo ended up on my left tube, so I\u2019ve been wondering if there\u2019s something wrong with my right tube.  My obgyn thinks I\u2019d be better off trying naturally for awhile (if it\u2019s open, it\u2019s fine, if it\u2019s blocked I\u2019d be treated for infertility anyway), but since I\u2019m 33 already, I\u2019m trying to decide whether I should just find out if the remaining tube is blocked and if so, skip straight to IVF.

I just need to vent a bit...\n\nOne of my best friends was 3 weeks ahead of me, and is having a healthy and happy pregnancy so far. I am still so genuinely happy for her and her husband even though we lost our baby, and cannot wait to meet their little babe. However, today she told me they are having a boy, and they are so excited. They desperately wanted a boy and found out today. All I could think was, \"Great, another thing goes perfectly for them.\" All I wanted was one healthy baby, yet here they are blissfully ignorant to loss and ALSO getting the gender they wanted, which I never would have cared about with my baby, as long as it was healthy and alive. And it's not that I don't want them to be happy, I truly am so glad everything is going well, it's just that I thought I was going to be okay and clearly I'm not. We recently decided not to go to their new years party either, just because she will be showing then ( we dont live in the same town so dont see each other often) and I'm afraid it will trigger me. And clearly it probably will since just the amazing news of them having a boy did. I feel so guilty, and of course would never say anything, I just wish I was not having these feelings of jealousy (or anger? I don't know), because they are awful. Please don't think I'm an awful person, because I'm not. I'm just upset and feel guilty for having these feelings, and needed to vent somewhere. xx", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "ttcafterloss", "subreddit_id": "t5_34scd", "subreddit_subscribers": 4364, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Jealousy for no good reason.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/ttcafterloss/comments/a74cfp/jealousy_for_no_good_reason/"}, {"author": "PokeMyEyes", "author_flair_background_color": "", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_template_id": "8b677c92-711f-11e4-b63c-12313b0b807d", "author_flair_text": "9/2018 TFMR | TTC #2", "author_flair_text_color": "dark", "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_183c2n5y", "author_patreon_flair": false, "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1545085266, "domain": "self.ttcafterloss", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/ttcafterloss/comments/a74nfe/can_we_have_a_random_cookie_or_other_yummy_things/", "gildings": {"gid_1": 0, "gid_2": 0, "gid_3": 0}, "id": "a74nfe", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 27, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/ttcafterloss/comments/a74nfe/can_we_have_a_random_cookie_or_other_yummy_things/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1545085266, "score": 1, "selftext": "Or just talk about cookies, it doesn't matter. \n\nI'll be making my special chocolate chip cookies using a recipe I've been tinkering with for a while.

Then i got pregnant at 38 yo and lost it to Trisomy 16 by 7 week, had a D&amp;C. A couple months later I was pregnant again and had a healthy boy. A year later I was pregnant and lost it to a heart rate of 50 that stopped and had another D&amp;C. Now i am pregnant again and the doctor said my first US was too small and only a yolk sac and gestational sac. According to my LMP I should've been 6w6d but he thinks I may have ovulated late and be about a week earlier than that. He left me with little hope, basically the heart will start beating in the next week or it won't. I have to wait til after Christmas for another ultrasound. The waiting is torture....and I am already devastated as I feel the outcome is bleak. I hate when people say well at least you had your boy. I KNOW that.
