I had two second trimester miscarriages the last couple of years - most recently in 2017 with twin girls. I have no living children. I get a lot of complications such as pregnancy induced hyperthyroidism and hyperemesis gravidarum. Both pregnancies I was hospitalized and overall, it was a traumatic experience. I deal with the fear of miscarriage again but as well, knowing that statically I will most likely get extremely ill again. About a 85% chance. Doctors have never been able to tell me why I lost and our genetic workups were perfect. \n\nSo here\u2019s what\u2019s keeping me up at night lately:\nAfter my last loss, I sought therapy and threw myself into my career. I excelled in a heavily male dominated tech workplace and am now a manager of a department. There\u2019s some talk of me moving up again. While all this is great and helped me reclaim confidence after my losses, whenever talk of my role comes up I get the pang of anxiety that if I conceive again, I will be extremely ill and it will be noticeable immediately. My last two losses are widely known because I made it into the second trimester and was sick so early, I had to come clean and take sick leave. I find myself feeling panicked - on top of worries of another miscarriage, health complications, I now have a career that might take a beating. Most of the men I work with are kind, but I was and will mostly still be the first female in my workplace to get pregnant (again). We are a startup company with no solid HR department. I have to go directly to the CEO with any HR related stuff. \n\nI\u2019m sure a lot of this feeling stems from feeling incredibly vulnerable and embarrassed after my losses but any words of wisdom would really help me with perspective here. I am 32, have one ovary and severe endometriosis. I know time is limited - but I\u2019m having a rough time kicking all this anxiety to the curb.", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "steward_reports": [], "stickied": false, "subreddit": "ttcafterloss", "subreddit_id": "t5_34scd", "subreddit_subscribers": 5997, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Working up the workplace courage after loss", "total_awards_received": 0, "updated_utc": 1567822170, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/ttcafterloss/comments/d0adou/working_up_the_workplace_courage_after_loss/"}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "AutoModerator", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_6l4z3", "author_patreon_flair": false, "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1567754014, "domain": "self.ttcafterloss", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/ttcafterloss/comments/d0damw/ttcafterloss_daily_discussion_thread_1_september/", "gildings": {}, "id": "d0damw", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 12, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/ttcafterloss/comments/d0damw/ttcafterloss_daily_discussion_thread_1_september/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1567754014, "score": 2, "selftext": "**How are you doing today?

I've brought up with two REs and my OBGYN and they don't seem concerned. I had hysteroscopy three weeks ago and it showed that my uterus looked fine. I also have really light periods now - basically went from 4 days of moderate bleeding to two light/medium. Again, no scar tissue, etc., to explain. We've been trying now for 6 months with no pregnancy when we previously got pregnant 1 or 2 cycle. I'm afraid I'm being ignored but I honestly don't know what to push for. We'd really like to try again naturally before moving on to IVF and since it's been two years I don't want to waste more time or find out something is REALLY wrong. Has anyone had anything similar?

We had previously seen a healthy, beating heart at 7 weeks. \n\nThere is one big thing that is really bugging me. At 9 weeks my midwife found I had extremely High blood pressure (I\u2019ve never had any known blood pressure problems before). She sent me to my GP and he was sure that the reason for my blood pressure was the fact that I was covered, head to toe in eczema (a condition I\u2019ve battled with since I was a baby). \n\nWe got the rash under control and my BP was back down within the week...in hindsight, the lower blood pressure could have been a result of the fact that the baby had died. \n\nNow...I have just had my first period since the loss, and we are ready to start trying again.

After a few days in the hospital and having returned home I had an appointment with my OB. He asked me what happens in the larger city, I broke down and couldn\u2019t even speak because here I was in his office less than a few days later now without a baby (how could he not know what happened).  I\u2019m 29 and this was my first pregnancy.  He told me I had to wait at least 12-18 months to try again because the molar pregnancy could come back.

What if I don't have kids at all? \n\nAnd lastly I am just so sad. My husband is a good guy, and I am sad for him.

I had a UTI which caused my waters to break which caused sepsis in my atomic fluid.

She was too sick to be resuistated as the sepsis started shutting down her heart. She was so wanted and is so so missed. We only TTC for her for one cycle and only had sex on two days to conceive her so it was very easy to get pregnant.\n\nWe used condoms until last month when I felt I would be ready for another baby again. We had sex ONCE on CD 14 in August. I took a test at 10 dpo all the way until yesterday. All positive, 15 in total (so many as I was concerned line wasn\u2019t get darker) and i was right to be concerned.

I'm 31 and recently had my first loss starting on 7/25.  It was a MMC, I was around 10 weeks but baby was only measuring 8w1d.  I had an early US at 7w5d (based on ovulation, not LMP) and baby was behind at 6w6d, had an enlarged yolk sac, but had a HR of 127.  I was on progesterone supplements at 14dpo, levels went down despite 200mg vaginal suppositories, and subsequently started injections in addition.  My second/last US was after only 3 shots so I don't know if they were effective in raising progesterone levels any, but it wouldn't have mattered as the pregnancy was obviously not viable. I requested the second US because of my concerns about slow growth and the size of the YS, combined with the low-ish progesterone and I'm glad I did, otherwise I would have waited till 12 weeks or till I started miscarrying on my own.  After we got the news that the baby no longer had a HB, I stopped the progesterone and started bleeding roughly a week later.  I still had retained tissue a week after that despite slowed bleeding, so I did a round of Cytotec.  Still had retained tissue two weeks later so I had a D&amp;C finally to remove the rest as it appeared stuck in my cervix/lower uterus.  HPTs were negative less than 48 hours after the procedure but I continued to bleed for another 5 or 6 days.  I ovulated sometime around 8/26, and am now on CD3 of my first post-MC cycle.  \n\nA little more about me, I have Hashimoto's Hypothyroidism, suspected PCOS, long and irregular cycles, and MTHFR mutation.  I have one LC, and struggled for 12 months before getting pregnant the first time.  I am medicated for my thyroid and levels currently are looking pretty good (post MC).  I have not had any CD3 labs done recently.  I also take a slew of vitamins: Prenatal with folate, Vit D, Vit C, Vit E, Omega-3, Ubiquinol, Ovasitol, and a Probiotic.\n\nI just started temping again and am curious to see how this first cycle goes since I have a history of such long and weird cycles.  My husband is on board to try again if that's what I want, and I don't really want to waste any time, I feel pretty ready at this point, though still scared of another loss.

Looking back at my charts, it seems to have varied in number of days and sometimes started on ovulation day and then a few days past, or other times a few days before ovulation through a few days after.  I had grown accustomed to it being my telltale sign which was helpful as I have mild PCOS and can sometimes have EWCM present multiple times before actual ovulation.  It also clued me in to when to start testing with OPKs.  \n\nTW, LC mentioned:\n\nAfter #1 was born, I didn't get my period back until 11months PP, and I continued to breastfeed until 18months (weaned at about 8w pregnant with the miscarried pregnancy) but the sensitive nipples were still present on the first few cycles I had PP, up until the cycle I got pregnant and then miscarried.  That cycle was weird, I couldn't tell if I was actually going to ovulate, any sensitivity I had was only noticed in the shower but no other times.  I also for the first time had a really short LH surge and never saw a positive OPK as it must have happened overnight.  Then, this first post-MC cycle was similar, except not even the slightest maybe-they're-sensitive-maybe-they're-not feeling, and again a really fast LH surge that most likely happened overnight.  \n\nI know ovulation symptoms can be different cycle to cycle, but it feels weird to me.  Not that I want my nipples to hurt but it makes me feel like something is off.

New there, new here, new to reddit.  I'm just going to basically post what I posted there as my introduction.\n\nI'm 32, live in Virginia, work in communications, and have been married for almost 8 years. I like playing music, gardening, anything to do with design, cooking and baking, reading fantasy and science fiction, and acquiring new skills. LC arrived in 2015 with no real issues, and my husband and I have been TTC#2 since Mar 2018 (18 months).\n\nHere's what has happened so far:\n\nI conceived in Sept 2018. Diagnosed with an ectopic pregnancy in my right tube, which was medically managed with two doses of methotrexate between weeks 7 and 8.\n\nI conceived again in Feb 2019 and then had an incomplete MC at 8 weeks. Two separate doses of misoprostol didn't work to finish the process, although I--not exaggerating--nearly fainted reading about what it was supposed to do to me (got about 90% of the way to fainting, realized what was happening, and sat down under my desk until the whooshing sound dissipated and the lights came back on). Finally, doctor performed a manual aspiration.\n\nI had a chemical pregnancy at 4 weeks in June, which was not confirmed by a doctor, only by home tests. Basically I got a positive test 11DPO, another 12DPO, then a negative 13DPO and got my period the next day.\n\nThen, I had another chemical pregnancy at 5 weeks this past Saturday, which was confirmed by my doc. That one is still ongoing.\n\nI apparently don't have a problem conceiving, I just can't hang on to them. \n\nStill, I'm not willing to give up, and my doc has finally agreed to start doing tests on me. My hunch, based on my other diagnosed medical issues (ADHD, allergies, asthma, and fibrocystic breast changes), is that I have low-progesterone.\n\nI hope that this is the place for me, and that I can find some kindred spirits here.\n\nNice to meet you all, and thanks for reading.", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "steward_reports": [], "stickied": false, "subreddit": "ttcafterloss", "subreddit_id": "t5_34scd", "subreddit_subscribers": 6011, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Hi, I'm new here and I've had 4 losses this year", "total_awards_received": 0, "updated_utc": 1568482736, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/ttcafterloss/comments/d3srb9/hi_im_new_here_and_ive_had_4_losses_this_year/"}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "SeaSaltSirens", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_156a8u", "author_patreon_flair": false, "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1568396701, "domain": "self.ttcafterloss", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/ttcafterloss/comments/d3subb/mc_but_no_visible_signs_of_mc/", "gildings": {}, "id": "d3subb", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_css_class": "question", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_template_id": "64bc0a4e-a73f-11e4-8d5c-22000bc1c25f", "link_flair_text": "Question", "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 4, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/ttcafterloss/comments/d3subb/mc_but_no_visible_signs_of_mc/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1568396702, "score": 1, "selftext": "I was told my hcg dropped and that I was in the process of having an MC.

I am hoping that is the case. Hopefully, it won't be the worst decision I've ever made. Either way, I hope your responses can be helpful, constructive, and kind. \n\n*What determines the end of a longterm friendship?* \n\nI'm currently grieving over a miscarriage that suddenly required immediate surgery. Naturally, this comes with grief and trauma, and for the lucky ones, we are privileged with family and friends who try to support us during these difficult times. This one friend, in particular, has been there for me during some really shitty times. We continuously have shared our love for one another and have called each other sisters for more than ten years. This year she bought a house, got engaged, got married and pregnant. I have been significantly involved with her achievements, and have gladly chosen to - she is my dear friend and I wouldn't have missed any of it for the world. I have just lost my baby, and she hasn't once checked in with me without either me calling her or someone telling her to text me.\n\nWhen we found out our pregnancy was a failure, I called her right away to tell her the news. She was naturally supportive but sad in hearing this; we both were pregnant at the same time. She never checked in with me again for another two weeks after telling her. (Please note, we text every week to each other, so this was strange, but I wanted to give her the benefit of the doubt). \n\nThen we heard from doctors we had a 50/50 chance of still being pregnant (our pregnancy journey is complicated, there is more to this, but I'm keeping it short). The day after I find this news out, she texts me asking me if I am free for lunch because she has the day off. Super casually. No \"Hey, how are and your husband dealing with the loss of your baby?\". I ask to call her instead, we talk, and I am an open book. I am sharing my grief, and I am sharing my sadness, and telling her how glad I am for my good friends who have been checking in with me lately while my husband and I grieve over the loss of our unborn child because I don't think I could've made it without them. She doesn't respond much, she wishes me peace and says to meditate during this difficult time. She doesn't offer to come over even though she lives down the road and is free that day and was curious about spending time with me before I brought this up. I am audibly sobbing on the phone, and she doesn't offer much. \n\nAnother week goes by, nothing from her still. It was then my husband's milestone birthday which, of course, she has been invited to for a while. We host the party with the bravest of faces for our many friends and family to celebrate my husband. He has been amazing during all of this, and he deserved a day of love for him. She comes with her husband, and we are friendly, chit-chat kinda stuff. We are busy hosting many other guests and try and give everyone our time. We didn't get to deeply check-in with them, but it's hard when everyone wants your attention. I do sincerely believe she understood this also and took no offense, but all in all, we were very friendly to them and them to us. \n\nThe next week follows - nothing from her still. No check-in, no \"have you heard anything from the doctor, are you pregnant or not?\", no \"how are you feeling?\". Nothing at all. We then find out our baby is officially passed. The miscarriage wasn't successful in naturally passing through my system on its own, and so I took oral medication to help. That caused issues whereby I needed surgery and had to be put under full anesthesia. Being that anesthesia presents many risks, I asked my husband to please message everyone close to us because I would want them to message me if this was happening to them. Everyone else we messaged replied immediately, some offered to come down to support my husband, my mother quits her meetings to come down. Everyone was loving and supportive. This best friend of ten years replies back 5 hours later to him. She responded with a couple of nice words but no signs of true concern or fear for my health. She asks what can she do. My husband says it would be nice if you could check-in with your friend, aka me. So only after my husband asks her to check-in with me, she does. And it is a sweet message, saying she loves me and is thinking of me, but it feels forced and way too late. Like four weeks too late. Four weeks after she found out my baby was most likely going to die, and only after my husband says to check-in with me, my best friend of 10 years finally texted me. \n\nSo! That's the story, and it is a lot to take in. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHere are my questions:\n\n*Are my expectations too high?* I felt she was accountable to check in with me, even just a text that came from her on her own initiative, and not because my husband asked her to. \n\nI also understand she is pregnant, and this might all scare her. I would understand and accept this, I love her. *Is she still accountable to tell me that she is thinking of me, but she is scared and it might be too overwhelming?* My other close friend is pregnant and has been checking in with me every day (she's a superwoman, I can't believe how supportive she has been). It isn't fair to compare, but I am confused right now and am comparing with what I know.\n\n*Is her neglect reasonable, and should I accept it?*\n\nAnd, *does this end our friendship?* I don't think I can get over this without her apologizing and earning back my trust. Honestly, I don't think she believes she needs to do that. I also feel very strongly that after all of this neglect that she needs to initiate this conversation. After all she has done, and after all I have gone through, I don't have it in me to start the discussion of why she did what she did. \n\n*When death happens, and it's your baby that dies, are there just some expectations that a best friend should be there immediately and not weeks later? I understand friends are busy, and they can't always be there for each other, but aren't there some unsaid expectations?*\n\nI've expected that during substantial life events, bad and good, I would be there for her immediately. *Is it unfair of me to want it in return?*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI am hoping the advice of strangers will be helpful for me. I have some people telling me I right to expect more. I really hope they all are not just telling me what I want to hear, but I am afraid I am going to lose my baby and my best friend in the same week and just want a strangers perspective to give me clarity.\n\nThank you all for reading.", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "steward_reports": [], "stickied": false, "subreddit": "ttcafterloss", "subreddit_id": "t5_34scd", "subreddit_subscribers": 6016, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Should my best friend be supportive during my miscarriage?", "total_awards_received": 0, "updated_utc": 1568522095, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/ttcafterloss/comments/d40oe2/should_my_best_friend_be_supportive_during_my/"}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "mgrima", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_ml4zqa7", "author_patreon_flair": false, "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1568435914, "domain": "i.redd.it", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/ttcafterloss/comments/d40pgv/some_of_my_miscarriagefertilityinfant_loss_chakra/", "gildings": {}, "id": "d40pgv", "is_crosspostable": false, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": true, "is_robot_indexable": false, "is_self": false, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 2, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/ttcafterloss/comments/d40pgv/some_of_my_miscarriagefertilityinfant_loss_chakra/", "pinned": false, "post_hint": "image", "preview": {"enabled": true, "images": [{"id": "12ZFIxgx475XZa1Mj4rW5aCr_vHVIbdWBQdPC5HmBzI", "resolutions": [{"height": 108, "url": "https://preview.redd.it/abo874lpnhm31.jpg?width=108&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=737d0de2a7cf0c28d402a8cb2c4fb226eeeacb42", "width": 108}, {"height": 216, "url": "https://preview.redd.it/abo874lpnhm31.jpg?width=216&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c2cb15917969ea8cb147ac81293d1ac47bb7300d", "width": 216}, {"height": 320, "url": "https://preview.redd.it/abo874lpnhm31.jpg?width=320&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3cd75f365a0a41176026aba6fcebfd2c2c9b1bba", "width": 320}, {"height": 640, "url": "https://preview.redd.it/abo874lpnhm31.jpg?width=640&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f4f1fe498ef25d441a255f568ef63d44e8027c06", "width": 640}, {"height": 960, "url": "https://preview.redd.it/abo874lpnhm31.jpg?width=960&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e93c664063201a799eecb4c6928051fb320fb058", "width": 960}, {"height": 1080, "url": "https://preview.redd.it/abo874lpnhm31.jpg?width=1080&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1a79547fbc621d42b2100b57c2eec7be5707cc1a", "width": 1080}], "source": {"height": 1936, "url": "https://preview.redd.it/abo874lpnhm31.jpg?auto=webp&amp;s=6ee867c8548a0b0d62ee12237924e538aa77b4df", "width": 1936}, "variants": {}}]}, "retrieved_on": 1568435923, "score": 1, "selftext": "", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "steward_reports": [], "stickied": false, "subreddit": "ttcafterloss", "subreddit_id": "t5_34scd", "subreddit_subscribers": 6016, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "image", "thumbnail_height": 140, "thumbnail_width": 140, "title": "Some of my Miscarriage/fertility/infant Loss Chakra Healing Bracelets. www.instagram.com/enchantedintentions", "total_awards_received": 0, "updated_utc": 1568522291, "url": "https://i.redd.it/abo874lpnhm31.jpg"}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "AutoModerator", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_6l4z3", "author_patreon_flair": false, "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1568444813, "domain": "self.ttcafterloss", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/ttcafterloss/comments/d41yxx/ttcafterloss_daily_discussion_thread_1_september/", "gildings": {}, "id": "d41yxx", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 5, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/ttcafterloss/comments/d41yxx/ttcafterloss_daily_discussion_thread_1_september/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1568444816, "score": 3, "selftext": "**How are you doing today?

Since my mc, I started using food as comfort. I am overeating junk food every night. All I want to do is watch Netflix and eat cookies. I think maybe depression is creeping in, and I am just annoyed that I have to muster up enough strength to force myself not to give in, when all I want to do is escape into TV dramas and comfort myself with chips. \n\nIt sucks because my husband is very fit and handsome. I feel very frumpy and unattractive lately. \n\nIt's hard because at the same time I had visions of finally getting back into regular fitness and maybe even losing 5 lbs. But just two days ago I had such severe abdominal pain that I stayed overnight and all the next day in the hospital. The diagnosis was basically they don't know why it happened and I should \"take it easy.\"\n\n I think after sex, my uterus just cramped severely and my cervix was so sensitive it couldn't be touched. There was no infection, and on my ovaries I had a few cysts, but within the normal range. \n\n I guess I can just walk for exercise. Anything that gets me out of the house is good, since I only work 5 hours per week max and the rest of the time I am a SAHM. \n\nAnd the other issue that I have had for 3 years now is that I am just lonely where we live. I do have a few friends but they all have busy lives. I am under-employed, and we use daycare for half the day, so often I am just bored. I only have housework to keep me busy, and I hate housework. I have hobbies but nobody to share them with. My husband works long long hours.  \n\nI'm getting sick of my own complaints at this point, so I am going to stop. Writing this has helped me to process it. I can see that I need something else going on in my day. I don't know how to work around an unpredictable work schedule, but I guess I can put in some boundaries there. But there is still the question of what do I do during the day to socialize? Everyone works and I don't know any other stay ot home moms.

I was a nervous wreck during my last pregnancy every time I had a beta draw (and that was despite knowing that I'd get my results only 3-4 hours afterward) or an ultrasound. I actually cancelled an appointment to have an additional scan at 9+3 (after scans at 6+1, 7+1, and 8+4 were all normal) because I knew that I would be anxious about the result and if one little thing were off (e.g., baby measuring an extra day behind, etc), I would obsess over it. Plus, I had hyperemesis, and that gave me a built-in sense of reassurance that everything was progressing normally. \n\nThat is, until it wasn't. Despite having hyperemesis, I still had a missed miscarriage at 13 weeks. I walked into my NT scan nauseous, weak, and dehydrated, only to find out that my baby's heart had stopped about a week earlier. Going forward, I know now that having hyperemesis isn't a reliable indicator (at least for me) that everything is okay, and it's causing me to re-think my attitude toward early monitoring -- primarily so that I don't end up suffering needlessly, sacrificing my time with my family and my reputation at work, for nothing. \n\nAny future pregnancies will happen under the care of an RE so I know I'll have 2-3 early scans before I graduate to my OB. My OB has already offered to do weekly scans if I want them. Obviously this is all hypothetical at this point, but I want to think through these decisions now so I don't feel rushed later. \n\nWhat are your thoughts on early monitoring?", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "steward_reports": [], "stickied": false, "subreddit": "ttcafterloss", "subreddit_id": "t5_34scd", "subreddit_subscribers": 6023, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Thoughts on early monitoring", "total_awards_received": 0, "updated_utc": 1568688321, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/ttcafterloss/comments/d4uo47/thoughts_on_early_monitoring/"}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "ttcal", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_2a73nxsv", "author_patreon_flair": false, "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1568603660, "domain": "self.ttcafterloss", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/ttcafterloss/comments/d4uz6r/uncertainty_in_ttc/", "gildings": {}, "id": "d4uz6r", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": false, "num_comments": 5, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/ttcafterloss/comments/d4uz6r/uncertainty_in_ttc/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1568606984, "score": 12, "selftext": "In fall 2018, we learned that our baby would likely not survive birth.

What happened next was I started to feel really afraid of my daughter's and my husband's safety and just generally aware of loss and pain and suffering in the world. I attributed it to the crashing hormones and life disruption (moving and having to delay a vacation due to the expected m/c). I saw my therapist during that time and she suggested it was connected to the miscarriage. That if I could have the promise of life disappear so suddenly like that that I was fearing it could also happen to others close to me. I totally wasn't expecting that reaction! I know the chance of miscarriage is like 1 in 3 for my age and that the chances of something happening to someone close to me are much lower but that fearfulness and anxiety are still there.
