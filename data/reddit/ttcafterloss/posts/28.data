Instead I was treated to an automated system that sent me to someone who apparently determined if my concern was good enough to speak to a nurse, THEN I got to speak to an nurse. I thought okay, yay, this person is either going to ease my mind or tell me to come in to be seen. You know what she did? Read from a damn computer screen a list of questions (and seemed to not really be listening to some of my answers..). I was floored, disappointed and it made me even more frustrated than I was before. I answered no to all of her questions and then she fucking told me based on my symptoms I should come into the ER to be seen. WHAT?? I just couldn't believe it. It did nothing to make me feel better and I just felt extremely disappointed after that. (Not to mention an ER visit would be beyond expensive, $300 copay plus probably 1k-2k for a short stay.. FML)\n\nI have called this hospital twice before - once at like 11PM and was able to actually speak to helpful people. I figured this would be the same but I guess they changed things. When I was going through my miscarriage I got to speak to a nurse who was the only kind, reassuring medical professional I had during that time but apparently my hospital doesn't do that anymore. :(\n\nAlso during my MC: I went to the ER at the same hospital and the doctor and nurse never told me I was probably miscarrying, they just danced around what I already suspected. The doctor played it off like their ultrasound machine was old and shitty and my HCG levels maybe peaked then started to fall at 10 weeks. A different nurse told me I was just bleeding from my cervix and all would be well, my pregnancy would be fine. She said this right before adding to my chart that it was a threatened miscarriage... without saying a word of it to me. False hope. Did I mention the people at the ER sent me home with papers on miscarriage but never once said that I was probably having one? Yeah..\n\nI know it's just another day, another dollar for these people probably.. but fuck, it makes me feel so isolated that most of them didn't really give a shit or even pretend to. Maybe they are so numb to it that it doesn't even phase them that I am a person with feelings and I need honesty or reassurance. I am just really frustrated and feel like I have very few options of people who actually give a shit about my concerns.

I'm 31, starting TTC in February and got very lucky that first time, but then had a miscarriage at 9 weeks in April. Have been trying again for 3 cycles now (as long as has been possible since getting my period back after my D&amp;C).\n\nI'm definitely not the most unlucky of people nor have I had an especially frustrating journey so far compared to many folks out there. But you know how it is - some days \"count your blessings\" still gets entirely overwhelmed and crushed by just feeling like nothing will go your way. \n\nI've definitely come up against the feeling that everyone but me in our lives is pregnant or has a baby, that we started talking about this long before anyone else but couldn't try right away and now it seems so unfair that \"everyone\" else got there first, that that one friend who \"never wanted kids\" changed her mind and got pregnant immediately and everything went just peachy keen smooth for her, and that even when I want to be (and am!) happy for pregnant friends I also just get more sad for me. Plus being even more anxious after losing the first pregnancy that we'll get unlucky in that regard again, and having lost trust in my body to do what I want it to. It's a big messy stew of not-very-comfortable feelings.\n\nSo that's me, but I know I should still be optimistic and shy away from the pity party given that it hasn't been that long, really, in the great scheme of things. I'm just a few days into this cycle's TWW now, and I seem to get a little more neurotic about it every month, so I thought I'd come spend some time here and try to maybe get some perspective as well as encouragement. \n\nThanks for reading and letting me join in around here!\n\n[Update: Not pregnant once again, so I'll be hanging around here for at least another month. I'm grateful to have a place to go and talk with people who get it though, and thanks everyone for the kind welcome.]", "stickied": false, "subreddit": "ttcafterloss", "subreddit_id": "t5_34scd", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Introducing myself", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/ttcafterloss/comments/4wuz43/introducing_myself/"}, {"author": "tranphi78", "author_created_utc": 1470736517, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_text": null, "author_fullname": "t2_109ksr", "created_utc": 1470736561, "domain": "youtube.com", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/ttcafterloss/comments/4wvev5/nh\u1eefng_sinh_v\u1eadt_b\u00ed_\u1ea9n_b\u1ecb_camara_ghi_h\u00ecnh_\u0111\u01b0\u1ee3c/", "gilded": 0, "id": "4wvev5", "is_self": false, "locked": false, "media": {"oembed": {"author_name": "\u0110\u1ed9ng v\u1eadt hoang d\u00e3", "author_url": "https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCWL-aToORvaphLTkv8se2VQ", "height": 338, "html": "&lt;iframe width=\"600\" height=\"338\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/8hbvUWKmt0c?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;", "provider_name": "YouTube", "provider_url": "https://www.youtube.com/", "thumbnail_height": 360, "thumbnail_url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/8hbvUWKmt0c/hqdefault.jpg", "thumbnail_width": 480, "title": "Nh\u1eefng sinh v\u1eadt b\u00ed \u1ea9n b\u1ecb camara ghi h\u00ecnh \u0111\u01b0\u1ee3c", "type": "video", "version": "1.0", "width": 600}, "type": "youtube.com"}, "media_embed": {"content": "&lt;iframe width=\"600\" height=\"338\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/8hbvUWKmt0c?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;", "height": 338, "scrolling": false, "width": 600}, "num_comments": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/ttcafterloss/comments/4wvev5/nh\u1eefng_sinh_v\u1eadt_b\u00ed_\u1ea9n_b\u1ecb_camara_ghi_h\u00ecnh_\u0111\u01b0\u1ee3c/", "retrieved_on": 1473030403, "score": 1, "secure_media": {"oembed": {"author_name": "\u0110\u1ed9ng v\u1eadt hoang d\u00e3", "author_url": "https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCWL-aToORvaphLTkv8se2VQ", "height": 338, "html": "&lt;iframe width=\"600\" height=\"338\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/8hbvUWKmt0c?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;", "provider_name": "YouTube", "provider_url": "https://www.youtube.com/", "thumbnail_height": 360, "thumbnail_url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/8hbvUWKmt0c/hqdefault.jpg", "thumbnail_width": 480, "title": "Nh\u1eefng sinh v\u1eadt b\u00ed \u1ea9n b\u1ecb camara ghi h\u00ecnh \u0111\u01b0\u1ee3c", "type": "video", "version": "1.0", "width": 600}, "type": "youtube.com"}, "secure_media_embed": {"content": "&lt;iframe width=\"600\" height=\"338\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/8hbvUWKmt0c?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;", "height": 338, "scrolling": false, "width": 600}, "selftext": "", "stickied": false, "subreddit": "ttcafterloss", "subreddit_id": "t5_34scd", "thumbnail": "default", "title": "Nh\u1eefng sinh v\u1eadt b\u00ed \u1ea9n b\u1ecb camara ghi h\u00ecnh \u0111\u01b0\u1ee3c", "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8hbvUWKmt0c&amp;feature=share"}, {"author": "_TheSlider_", "author_created_utc": 1462830913, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_text": null, "author_fullname": "t2_xtaee", "created_utc": 1470744492, "domain": "self.ttcafterloss", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/ttcafterloss/comments/4wvuaj/menstrual_cycle_length/", "gilded": 0, "id": "4wvuaj", "is_self": true, "link_flair_css_class": "question", "link_flair_text": "Question", "locked": false, "media_embed": {}, "num_comments": 6, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/ttcafterloss/comments/4wvuaj/menstrual_cycle_length/", "retrieved_on": 1473030619, "score": 2, "secure_media_embed": {}, "selftext": "Hi everyone, I normally have a 29 day cycle but I've been known to have a 25 day cycle.

My pregnancy was a surprise; I was on birth control. We weren't married or even engaged at the time, and had been on the fence about ever having kids in the future - we could see the appeal of both sides, and just never had a reason to officially decide either way. Then, I got pregnant. Once we made the decision to continue the pregnancy, we never looked back and have been so happy with where our life has taken us. The pregnancy was perfect, easy, no complications, and I delivered a healthy full term boy at 40 weeks and 4 days. Life is good. \n\nThis past winter, we decided to casually try for #2 and I had my IUD removed. Again, we were kind of on the fence for another, but ultimately made the decision that we didn't want our son to be an only child. We didn't track anything, periods or sex. I wound up making the decision to eat better and get more active, and lost 50 lbs while getting in the best shape of my life. I was enjoying my new fitness level and healthy body, and then boom - found out I was pregnant in late June. \n\nI was initially somewhat depressed about being pregnant, which my husband understood. It took about a week to really get back into pregnancy mode and being excited. Since I wasn't tracking anything g, I had no idea about my last period. I just couldn't remember. My OB made a ballpark guess for my first ultrasound and said if it was early, no big deal. Husband and I show up for our first appointment, and surprise, it's identical twins! What a \"holy shit\" moment. They estimated I was around six weeks, and two heartbeats were present. Doc wanted me back in two weeks for a better dating ultrasound. I was terrified, and scared, but husband was excited. Twins run in my family, and I was the first one to \"carry on\" the lineage for my generation. \n\nIn those two weeks between ultrasounds, I got really, really excited about having twins. Terrified still, but excited to be a part of an exclusive club. I bonded and instantly felt that they were girls. I had the same weird intuition with my first pregnancy, that turned out to be correct. Of course this could just be coincidence, but I still bonded with what I believed to be twin girls. Two weeks went by and I felt OK. Pregnant, tired, nausea all the time. Nothing changed. \n\nNext ultrasound, and I'll never forget the sonographer when she just said, \"oh...\" And I just knew. No heartbeats. I was devastated. Luckily my husband was there with me. It was so terrible, that moment of everything crashing down. I had no symptoms of a miscarriage at all, and had been vomiting as per my normal nausea that very morning. I was so completely shocked. I made the decision to have a D&amp;C. \n\nMy procedure was uneventful, medically speaking. Doctors were all compassionate and understanding. Emotionally it was horrible. I was a mess when I was brought into the OR. The anesthesiologist was great and I was asleep almost immediately. My pathology was normal. \n\nI've had no complications and things have been going well in my recovery period. Every day gets a bit easier, but some days just suck. I had my first post-op appointment yesterday and was in the sam room as I was when discussing the miscarriage, so I was pretty emotional. My husband was with me so that helped. \n\nI was give a clean bill of health and the go-ahead to start trying again. Doc recommended waiting one cycle for dating purposes, but ultimately said if I get pregnant this cycle it means my body is ready as there is no research that shows any disadvantages to getting pregnant immediately. He said whatever I want to do is ok. My husband and I agreed to just let things happen and if it happens this cycle ok, but if not that's ok too and we can try more precise tracking next cycle.\n\nMy emotions have been such a whirlwind, from being somewhat sad about being pregnant at first, to getting excited, to being terrified about twins, to being happy, and now dealing with loss. I'm also angry that my first, accidental, pregnancy was such a breeze, and now here I am in the best shape of my life, making an informed decision to try to get pregnant, and I miscarry. It just seems so cruel and backwards. I know my story is has some of those obnoxious \"wasn't even trying to get pregnant\" parts to it, and I can totally understand how frustrating that is to those struggling with TTC, but it doesn't mean I didn't come to love being pregnant with twins. I realize now how badly I did want it, even if it took an emotional roller coaster to figure it out. I'm now trying to get back to where I was before I learned I was pregnant again, and I know I can't. Instead, I'm trying to be sensible and learn what I can from this recovery process and be strong going into TTC again. \n\nThanks for reading my story. I just never thought I'd have a miscarriage, despite how naive that sounds. I'm 35, so I'm terrified of how I'll feel during the next subsequent pregnancy, and I'm worried the fear of another miscarriage will be overbearing. My age makes me feel like I waited too long. I just hate being on this side of things. \n\nMy question being, has anyone else made the decision to let things happen immediately after a D&amp;C/miscarriage, aka not waiting a full cycle? I enjoy the closeness and intimacy, and kind of feel like whatever happens is just meant to happen. I'm not obsessed with getting pregnant immediately, more along the lines of just letting whatever is meant to be take its course. \n\nThanks again ladies. I'm so grateful this group exists.

After some lurking, I'm hoping this is the place for me. (TFAB has finally pushed me over the edge.) My husband and I are both 30 and have been TTC since October of 2015. In March my MD put me on Clomid and we got pregnant on our second Clomid cycle. I ended up having a miscarriage on June 16th at 8w+4. I was literally sitting there watching the NBA finals and next thing I know I was in the worst pain of my life. Emotionally I'm doing way better than I expected and my body seems to be back on track. We are currently 5 DPO. This is cycle 8 of trying and my doctor is giving me three more cycles after this to get pregnant before going to a RE. A few non-TTC things about me, I love sports (especially college football Roll Tide! and love the Packers), cats, makeup, and reading. Also, I am trying to lose some damn weight, which seems to be a lifelong journey for me. Haha. Anyways, you all seem very nice and encouraging and I absolutely love the set up with the daily discussion and alumni posts. Thanks for reading, and I apologize that this is so long.

This weekend, my SIL got married. I should have been 5 months pregnant.\n\nMy husband and I have been married for 2 years, an no one in his family has ever made comments to us about having kids. I know a lot of people would be happy to have this situations, but for me, it feels like his family does not want us to have kids. The few times it has come up, my MIL has changed the subject.\n\nI thought it would bother me a lot more than it did every time my SIL pointed out some aunt making a comment about how she will be having kids soon. I was pleasantly surprised how ok I was. Until a wedding photo was posted to FB and someone commented to my MIL &amp; FIL \"Congrats! Pretty soon you'll be grandparents!!\".\n\nI don't know why this one hurt in particular. I had to leave the wedding for a short bit after this comment was brought up. Of course they would be grandparents soon, but why not make this comment 2 years ago when I got married? They should have been grandparents before Christmas, but now they won't be.\n\nI wonder if it was just my breaking point on this whole thing. My SIL wasn't even dating her husband until after our wedding. My husband and I always assumed we would give the first grandkids, but joked one of his younger sisters would snipe it just to spite us. Now it is a reality. My SIL has already complained to me that she is baby crazy and her husband is pushing her to start right away (he wants 6 kids).\n\nI'll admit, before my loss, there was a competitive part of me that wanted to give the first grand kid....a small part of me still wants that. However after my loss I came to realize that I do not care about \"beating\" anyone...I just want my own child. \n\nI had hoped to be first, simply to get closer to my MIL. If our weddings are any reference, I worry that if SIL gets pregnant before or at the same time as me, my MIL won't give a shit about our baby. She won't want to come baby shopping with us, or won't help out because she has SIL to worry about. MIL has already made a comment basically saying that grandkids from me won't be the same as grandkids from her own daughters.\\\n\nI don't want SIL to put her life on hold...she deserves to be happy and have kids whenever she wants. I worry that it will just absolutely destroy me if she announces she is pregnant before I conceive. I don't even have my specialist appointment until October. I should have had this appointment in April, but I found out I was pregnant right before it, and lost it the day after I should have had the appointment.\n\nI'm just feeling so done right now. As if the universe has decided to throw every joke in our face. It is sad that this TTC journey has made me afraid to think or say anything aloud because I am now a firm believer in jinxes.\n\nSorry for this garbled rant.

I don't really know what to say here. It's been a rough go for my husband and I. Last October I found out I was pregnant after our first month trying. It was crazy- every doctor I ever saw told me that I would likely have fertility issues and I was fully prepared to dig in and patiently take whatever steps I needed to. So imagine my surprise when, on our 4 year wedding anniversary, to find out that we were having twins. It was a shock to say the least. I had mixed emotions about it to be honest. I was scared. It certainly wasn't the plan I had for us- I was overwhelmed just imagining how our life would be with two. Then, as time went on and my pregnancy progressed, I let myself get excited. Everyone said how they would have a best friend for life, and that being a twin parent was special. Crazy hard, but incredible. And so we got comfortable. We found out they were girls. We picked out names and bought two cribs. \n\nOn May 7th, I went in to the emergency room with extremely high blood pressure. I had severe pre-eclampsia. At 34 weeks, they were going to induce me. On May 10th, Nora Lux and Lena Rose were born via C-section. They were perfect. Lena scored a 9 on her APGAR and Nora was a 7. They went up to the NICU and I couldn't go see them because I was on magnesium for the pre-e. Later that night we got a call from the NICU that something was wrong with Lena, without going into too much detail, she had an infection and was not responding to antibiotics. The nurses helped me out of bed and we went up to see her but when we got up there the doctors made it seem like she was doing better so we went back down to the room. Early the next morning they called us again and told us that we should come up and hold her. Lena Rose died in my arms 26 hours after she was born. \n\nNora is home and doing well now. To say life has been hard would be an understatement. How do you grieve a child at the same time you want to celebrate one? Every thing Nora does is a reminder that Lena is not there, too. I never knew that you could literally feel your heart breaking. You go from one special club of being a twin mom to another special club of being a mother of loss. Some days I feel so lost in my own emotions.\n\nMy husband and I have decided to try again. Nora was not supposed to be an only child. I'm scared of being pregnant again. No baby will ever replace Lena. I'm scared that it will be twins again- and I'm scared that it won't. I wonder how I'll feel if its a boy when I was supposed to have two girls. There are so many worries when I want to be excited. If you made it through this, thank you for reading. I can already see how strong you ladies are. Hopefully I can draw from your strength.", "stickied": false, "subreddit": "ttcafterloss", "subreddit_id": "t5_34scd", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Intro: it wasn't supposed to be like this", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/ttcafterloss/comments/4y00oq/intro_it_wasnt_supposed_to_be_like_this/"}, {"author": "cookmybook", "author_created_utc": 1316543087, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_text": null, "author_fullname": "t2_5w803", "created_utc": 1471370250, "domain": "self.ttcafterloss", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/ttcafterloss/comments/4y0v19/im_back_again_to_try_or_ivf/", "gilded": 0, "id": "4y0v19", "is_self": true, "link_flair_css_class": "update", "link_flair_text": "Update", "locked": false, "media_embed": {}, "num_comments": 5, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/ttcafterloss/comments/4y0v19/im_back_again_to_try_or_ivf/", "retrieved_on": 1473051527, "score": 6, "secure_media_embed": {}, "selftext": "I have had 4 miscarriages in the last year.

The baby had stopped developing around 6.5 weeks. It was a devastating experience for us both, especially considering we had such an easy pregnancy with our daughter the first time around and took it for granted things would probably be ok.  I opted for the misoprostol which had me bleeding heavily off and on for weeks after. It took a long time to return to normal.\n\nAfter several months we got another positive pregnancy test in July. We were optimistic, but both very reserved about this pregnancy understandably. I have been very nervous waiting for the first appointment scheduled for 9 weeks, but tried my best to put it in the back of mind so as not to focus on it. I had all the classic pregnancy symptoms and could even feel some of the pressure of my uterus growing. I was cautiously optimistic.\n\nYesterday we finally went in for our first appointment at 9 weeks. As soon as it was time for the scan I began to tremble and cry as the memories of the last terrible experience came rushing back. The doctor and husband were wonderful in trying to comfort me.  I couldn't see the monitor during the scan. The doctor said she could see the baby in there... She didn't say anything again for a few moments. My heart was pounding. Then she finally sighed and said those words I never hoped to hear again, \"I'm sorry, I don't see a heartbeat.\" The appointment for was exactly 9 weeks and the baby measured exactly 9 weeks in size. I had just lost it, maybe even that morning.\n\nWe opted for a D&amp;C this time and I went into surgery that evening. So far the bleeding and pain has been minimal compared to last time, though I am convinced I retained some tissue previously. We had the fetal tissue sent to the lab for testing and I will be getting some additional bloodwork done this time around. I am getting much better care from this doctor than the other I saw previously which has made a huge difference. I think despite being farther along this time, I was less attached to this pregnancy due to my fears. I feel like I am dwelling less on the 'what-ifs\" and just want to move forward quickly and hopefully onto a successful pregnancy.

She has known for 16 weeks now, and we were hoping that she would be feeling better but she seems to have fallen down further. \n\nWe suspect that she might be suffering from PTSD, because she is avoidant of pretty much all pregnancies and she keeps reliving the due date for each lost pregnancy. \n\nWe don't want to have the relationship damaged, but I am looking for ways to be able to support her through this in a way that can foster a more positive relationship since she essentially avoids me in every way possible (which isn't hard because we live across the country from each other). \n\nAny insight and advice on how to navigate this would be appreciated. \n\n", "stickied": false, "subreddit": "ttcafterloss", "subreddit_id": "t5_34scd", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Supporting SIL (F32) who has gone through 4 miscarriages", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/ttcafterloss/comments/4y7483/supporting_sil_f32_who_has_gone_through_4/"}, {"author": "momerathsoutgrabe", "author_created_utc": 1355101724, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_text": null, "author_fullname": "t2_9uhry", "created_utc": 1471463327, "domain": "self.ttcafterloss", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/ttcafterloss/comments/4y7pyh/guess_whos_back_back_again/", "gilded": 0, "id": "4y7pyh", "is_self": true, "link_flair_css_class": "intro", "link_flair_text": "Intro", "locked": false, "media_embed": {}, "num_comments": 3, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/ttcafterloss/comments/4y7pyh/guess_whos_back_back_again/", "retrieved_on": 1473054989, "score": 6, "secure_media_embed": {}, "selftext": "Hey guys.

My journey began back in 2007 when me and my husband (then fianc\u00e9) started ttc and I ended up having an ectopic pregnancy that resulted in an emergency surgery after an incompetent doctor diagnosed me as being constipated and sent me on my way for a week. I lost part of my left tube. In 2008 we found out I was pregnant a week before our wedding and went on to have a pretty uneventful pregnancy that led to our son. Decided to try for number two when our son was a year old. Tried for a year and a half with no success. Went to the doctor and she put me on clomid for a few cycles, also with no success. Had a slew of tests done and they can't find a reason why I'm not conceiving. Doctor referred me to an RE, but the cost was just to much for us to go on. Just tried the ol natural way ever since. After the first few years it doesn't really feel like trying, it's just like the norm. I was starting to accept that I was only going to have my son, and it would be fine... Then beginning of this month I noticed my boobs were super sore. I bought a pregnancy test because usually when I do I start my period the next morning. Took it the evening I bought it (August 2nd) and it was a faint positive! Thought it was most likely wrong and tested the next morning and it was a darker positive! I freaked out. Told my husband, ugly cry and all. Called my doctor and ordered the blood test. The next day I called and sure enough my blood test was positive! We were so happy after almost 7 years it was going to finally happen! We told most of our family, lots of happy tears. Then just a few days later on the 7th I woke up to bleeding. Went to ER and they said it was possibly a miscarriage and to follow up with my OB the next day, which would have been my intake appointment. Went and saw the physicians assistant, cervix was open lots of bleeding, she said it's likely a miscarriage and did blood work to confirm. Next day sure enough my levels dropped. Couldn't believe this was happening. Feel like the universe hates me. But I'm done bleeding now and feel like when we first started trying, now I know it's possible for me to get pregnant.

I had to understand that he went through the same pain as I did, he might not show it but we both lost someone we had so many dreams and late night conversations about. \nRecently I applied for a job and ended up getting it a week later. For me whatever the job I'm extremely excited, mostly to get out of the house but also contributing an income to the household. \nSilly me, trying to share the excitement with my family who can never be happy with anything. I'm not ready to go back to school and they're constantly pushing me and demeaning me because I'm 25 and haven't finished my degree. Initially after marriage my husband and I were going to be long-distance because I was supposed to finish up school while living with family and then later join him in his new duty station. \nWe realized it became too much for us 6 months in.  It wasn't right for us to start out our marriage with distance, so I moved everything and closed the distance. My parents weren't happy about that but hey, I'm a married woman and what I do is my business.\nLong story short, my mother keeps on trying to get me to start school here, which I don't want to. She basically stated that I ruined my life getting married and moving. Also, people who are dumb work in retail and basically I'm an embarrassment! Oh not to mention she even used the whole \"why did we come to this country?\" My sister too made me feel worthless. \nLong rant short. My husband told me whatever I did he supports me and he's proud of me for getting a job. He said whenever I'm ready for school I can do it. We went out on a breakfast date, he let me go shopping for new clothes, make up and shoes. We played video games all weekend. \nThrough it all, my realization is, my family is my husband.

I'm mostly going through this alone with my husband and it's been tough and confusing.  First, I'll try and give a short synopsis of my situation.  I'm 31, and after trying unsuccessfully to conceive naturally for 17 months, I finally saw on OBGYN.  He noted cysts on my ovaries and some insulin resistance, so I started Metformin in May and Clomid for my June cycle.  In early July, I got a positive HPT (and then about 30 more over the next several weeks) and we were elated.  I went for my first prenatal appointment at about our weeks and there was no heartbeat.  HCG tests over the next 48 hours went from 81k to 89k, so I was told I was or would miscarry.\n\nI totally freaked out and had a lot of trouble coping.  I needed to get the baby (or embryo or whatever) out ASAP, so I had a D&amp;E on Friday the 12th.\n\nAs of now, I'm still cramping and spotting a little bit and am just generally miserable, but I also am having a weird sensation when I urinate.  It seems to take more effort and seems harder to empty my bladder.  It also seems more urgent when I have to go.  Has anyone else experienced this?  I plan to ask my Dr. at my followup appt on Thursday, but I was wondering if any of you amazing and helpful women might be able to help me out with coming up with a list of addition questions.  I've been in a major fog since this all went down and I feel like I'm not thinking clearly at all.  So far, I'm going to ask:\n\n- Why does it feel weird when I pee?\n- Should I still be concerned about the cramping and spotting?\n- I'm EXHAUSTED all the time.  Depression?  Something else?\n- When can we start trying again?\n- Will I use Clomid again?\n- Is there anything within my possible control that I can do to make sure we get pregnant again and that I don't go through this devastation?\n\nI feel like kind of an ass because I know many of you have been through this a number of times and I give you kudos for keeping your shit together, I feel like I'm breaking down and I've only had it happen once.  \n\nThank you all so much for being such an amazing and helpful community and a place where I can read about this terrible situation without bias or judgment.

AND - we just canceled Europe. :(  Yay for today?\n\nIf that isn't enough, my friend had her baby boy 2 days ago. And I have 2 other really good friends who are due in the next 3 weeks.\n\nBut if that isn't enough, either...lets just do a rundown of my 2016 so far:\n\n* January: Pregnant and so excited and scared\n* February: Miscarriage and D&amp;C\n* March: CP\n* April: Go under contract on our \"dream home\" ...my job makes that impossible and we have to back out on the house, losing the house and money. (Decide to go to Europe for a vacation since no baby and no house)\n* May-June: See my RE multiple times for testing...find no reason...but find out I likely can't get pregnant on my own again. Argh.\n* July: Tear my stupid ACL and have surgery. Now I can't play softball or cycle, help on our house remodeling, drive, walk, etc...and am in pain.  Oh and got offered/accepted a new job...but then lost THAT due to a crazy manager (I think I dodged a bullet here but still).\n* August (so far): Cancel our Europe trip due to my knee. :( Work and PT and not much else. And now it's my EDD.\n\nI honestly can't catch a break, it seems. These things just keep piling on and while some don't have to do with my pregnancy loss, they are losses and I just feel like I can't win. \n\nWe talked just last week in my local support group about not letting TTC rule your life and getting out there and doing things. One girl in our group wasn't leaving her house or signing up for things she loved due to ttc. Me on the other hand -- I started cycling tons, was back to playing softball multiple times a week, was working on our house, and was planning this amazing trip with my husband. We decided to take a leap and make a big move/buy another house...everything! I was purposely going out and living life, doing the things I wanted to do/love...and life has been beating me down at every corner. No baby, no new house, no new job, no sports/etc, no vacation...AND top it off with knee surgery. \n\nI'm at a point where I'm not even sure how to handle my feelings. I just feel so down all the time. About so many aspects. And people can say \"Oh well try to switch things up\"...well, I've been trying. See where that has gotten me?\n\nAND THEN...my husband and I just don't relate well about our losses. He wants to \"fix me\", I swear. I can't be FIXED. And he hates to see me sad, so he just wants to not talk about it or he literally tells me \"don't be sad\". Umm that doesn't work. He is sad, too, I know it -- but doesn't express it almost ever, so that hurts me too. I feel alone. And when I just need hugs and cuddles and to cry, he is wanting to fix things. It's so hard to relate and it makes things worse. \n\nI know changing the year is arbitrary...but I am so over 2016.  In 2015 I had my first MC and I just wanted the year to end. I found out I was pregnant again in December and was so looking forward to 2016. But this year has piled shit on the entire time and I am over it. But I also can't say \"bring on 2017\" anymore, like it's gonna HELP anything. So, I know its arbitrary, but Fuck 2016. \n\nAhhhhhhhhhhhh.

I just turned 32 and my husband and I are trying for our second child-- first living child-- after a TFMR at 24 weeks.  We found out at our 20-week scan that our baby had only one artery in his umbilical cord, went for a level-2 ultrasound a few days later which found a heart defect, excess amniotic fluid from a swallowing problem, and some unusual physical features.  We had an amniocentesis and got the results at 23w5d.  Baby had DiGeorge Syndrome, aka 22q11.2 deletion syndrome, which is a completely random genetic mutation that's not related to the age or health of the parents.  \n\nWe were very concerned, especially because many children with this disease are not detected until well after birth, but our little boy was already showing physical symptoms at 20 weeks gestation.  We just didn't want to subject our child to a life of physical and mental anguish, and made the absolutely horrible decision to terminate.  I would never wish this situation on my worst enemy, but it happened to us, we became a statistic.  I never in my life thought I would ever terminate a pregnancy for any reason, but now am the wiser.  No one can ever understand what it's like to be in that position until they've been there.\n\nSo it will be two weeks tomorrow that we went through labor and delivered our peacefully sleeping baby boy, who we gave a name that we loved.  We took pictures, we have his footprints, and we will soon have his ashes to keep forever.  We loved him so much.\n\nI am waiting for my lochia to stop and hoping to get my fertility back soon.  I have been charting for years, to avoid pregnancy naturally, until we conceived on our second cycle trying for our first pregnancy.  I am hoping that my body gets back to its normal self, though I don't have the most regular cycles, and I'm afraid that my post-pregnancy body will be confused or that the grief we are experiencing will cause my body to not ovulate for a long time.  Only time will tell so I have to be patient.  I see my doctor on Tuesday for my first postpartum visit and am hoping to get the go-ahead to resume our normal life and try for another baby soon.  \n\nWe are hoping to eventually have at least 2 children but I am 32 and now regretting that we waited this long and praying that we don't end up heartbroken and childless.  Or I guess we'll just be the rich aunt and uncle or we'll adopt...\n\nAny words of wisdom regarding the physical or mental aspects of this process of recovering from a TFMR or stillbirth and moving on to trying for another after this are welcome.  It is very scary to realize that having a healthy baby is not as easy as it seems, from conceiving in the first place, to the chances of losing that child or of having a child with serious physical and/or mental problems.  I never knew that trying to have a family could be such an uncertain process.\n\nAnyway, I think we will take a leap of faith and hope for the best, hope that lightning doesn't strike twice, and hope that my body cooperates and we can have a healthy little sibling for our baby boy in heaven very soon.", "stickied": false, "subreddit": "ttcafterloss", "subreddit_id": "t5_34scd", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Intro (TW- TFMR)", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/ttcafterloss/comments/4zivpj/intro_tw_tfmr/"}, {"author": "tenpercentpanda", "author_created_utc": 1471966911, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_text": null, "author_fullname": "t2_10tehi", "created_utc": 1472142841, "domain": "self.ttcafterloss", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/ttcafterloss/comments/4zjerd/are_there_any_women_in_their_40s_still_ttc_donor/", "gilded": 0, "id": "4zjerd", "is_self": true, "link_flair_css_class": "question", "link_flair_text": "Question", "locked": false, "media_embed": {}, "num_comments": 8, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/ttcafterloss/comments/4zjerd/are_there_any_women_in_their_40s_still_ttc_donor/", "retrieved_on": 1473079227, "score": 2, "secure_media_embed": {}, "selftext": "My husband and I have been ttc for over 7 yrs, and after multiple losses.
