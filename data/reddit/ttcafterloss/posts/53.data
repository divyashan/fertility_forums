It was my second missed miscarriage--around 7 weeks I went in for an ultrasound and there was a ~5 week pregnancy present with a \"faint heartbeat.\"  A week later, it hadn't progressed, and I took misoprostol and passed the pregnancy.  This was shortly before Christmas. \n\nAt my follow-up ultrasound, there was a \"tiny\" piece of tissue they were concerned about.  My doctor said it could be a polyp, or it could be a bit of retained tissue and if it was the latter, it would very likely pass on its own or be reabsorbed on its own.  She instructed me to come back in 2 weeks for another ultrasound to check.\n\nThat brings me to today.  I had my follow-up follow-up ultrasound, which shows that \"tiny\" piece of tissue still there.  There's no way to tell without further testing whether it's pregnancy tissue or a polyp, but either way the recommendation is to have it surgically removed.  I'm waiting now for the call from the hospital to schedule that surgery, which will be very similar to a D&amp;C (I also had a D&amp;E with my second miscarriage in 2014).  \n\nSo, I guess my questions are, does anyone have experience with polyps?  Specifically, does anyone have experience with polyps and miscarriage?  Should I be concerned the polyp is indicative of a bigger problem?  \n\nMy doctor seemed to think if that's what it is, it's very possible that it's responsible for my most recent miscarriage (I wonder, too, if it's responsible for the relatively long time it took to conceive this pregnancy compared to my previous three).  I have a son born in 2015, and she said the polyp could have developed after that, which would explain this most recent miscarriage but not the two before I had my son.  \n\nI guess I just wanted to share this update and see if anyone had similar experiences.

It was also the furthest along we\u2019ve ever gotten, and had already heard the heartbeat twice and all labs had been perfect to that point. We were confidently hopeful, but nervous.

We lost two pregnancies and it\u2019s devastating seeing others so easily have a baby while all I feel like I get handed is heartache and failure. The second I started having trouble conceiving it was like everyone in the world was pregnant. The first pregnancy I lost might not actually be considered a loss, so I apologize if I\u2019m using the wrong term. Our dr advised us that the fetus was most likely not viable and after much heartache we decided to terminate. It was the most painful choice I ever made and still hurts me today.

While I am over the moon for them, I\u2019m also incredibly sad and envious. They were barely trying and announced to us they were pregnant at 7 weeks pregnant, it was a week after we had the termination, which they knew about. It was like being stabbed in the chest.

I am finally feeling brave enough to come out of the shadows :) My TTC journey has been really painful and it has taken me a while to really process and come to terms with everything. I saw folks reference this subreddit in /r/TryingForABaby and this looks like my home. I have been privately struggling with my pain. I am... I am ready to be an active member of this community and give support to others as well as accept the support of others &lt;3\n\nI chose this username because it means \"well-made\" in French and I think that despite my struggles with TTC, my body is, in fact, well-made :)\n\nIRL I am an IT project manager, but my background is in plant science. My dream job would be to own and manage a greenhouse or tree farm. I love to grow things! I can't wait for springtime.\n\nMy husband and I grew up together (we met in middle school!) but didn't start dating until our early twenties. We lost touch with one another in college but reconnected after we both graduated....one thing led to another and here we are. We just had our 10 year dating anniversary a few weeks ago. We were married in May 2016, and started TFAB in April 2017. We both always knew we wanted to have children together but wanted to wait until I finished my postgraduate studies and got a steady job before starting.\n\nOur TFAB journey thus far... I got pregnant in May 2017, but suffered a missed miscarriage at 10 weeks - my OBGYN thinks it was a blighted ovum/chromosomal abnormality because the sac stopped developing at 6 weeks and she couldn't see a fetal pole. Took my body a month to figure it out and was able to miscarry naturally, though I was hospitalized due to heavy bleeding and having difficulty passing the debris (I was having full-on contractions.) Overall it was a pretty devastating and traumatic experience, but I got the all clear to start trying again right away. And on the bright side, I now 100% know I want an epidural when I give birth!!\n\nWell that MC really messed up my hormones because my cycles have been all kinds of wonky since - I've been ovulating regularly, but at different times, and have developed symptoms of luteal phase defect (10-12 day luteal phases). My cycle length has varied anywhere from 22 days to 39 days in the cycles I've had since then. The straw the broke the camel's back was that I had a chemical pregnancy this past November - got a positive test at 12 DPO and my period started that night. I saw my OBGYN with tears of frustration, and a progesterone test after that found my progesterone was really low in LP. So I'm on my first cycle taking progesterone supplementation during the LP. I also have a referral now to see a fertility specialist if I don't get pregnant this cycle. So...fingers crossed!\n\nThanks for having such a great community.

Today marks day 1 of taking care of me. We are coming up on the third year since we found out we were pregnant with our , now, 2 year old son. With that also means we are creeping ever closer to the 1 year Mark to when we lost Squid. With that it means we are officially 6 months in to ttc after our loss with no success.\n\nToday is the first day that I have chosen to take care of me. I have left a toxic stressful job that has given me nothing but anxiety, stress, back spasms and possibly crippled my ttc journey. It caused my periods to be all kinds of out of whack (used to be 28 days like clock work,now we are all over the map). Has caused my self-esteem to plummet, and my ability to cope with everyday stresses to become zero. Every month when I would take a pregnancy test I would literally end up spending a week in complete meltdown and shut off from my husband because it was just another month down the drain of no success. It was something I simply didn't have the capacity to handle because of the stresses of my job. But not anymore.\n\nI am going back to the same job and place I worked at when we lost Squid a year ago, the same people and the same everything. Less stress, a group of people that love and appreciate my contribution during my work day. And more importantly something that I enjoy and can be relaxed in. \n\nIt is a job that allows me the ability to seek help from my doctor to look into what may be happening with my cycles and why we have suddenly struggled to get pregnant when before my husband looked at me and got me pregnant. I am hoping that by the time May comes around if I'm not already pregnant, my body had returned to normal or I have answers and we are embarking on a treatment plan.\n\nToday is the first day of taking control back and taking care of me.

Also, omg I wrote a novel. Thanks to anybody who actually reads all of this!\n\ntl;dr: MMC in June 2016, miscarriage in November 2016, followed by 10 more months TTC. PTSD from MMC, anxiety, depression, binge eating disorder. As a \"normal\" person, I crochet, play Overwatch, read a lot of non-fiction, and am learning to play Pathfinder.\n\nI'm 28, and my husband and I have been TTC since April of 2016. We got amazingly lucky, and got pregnant on Cycle 2. Huzzah! Things were going great, we'd made it to the 8 week mark with no problems, actually announced to my family on July 4th. We spent Saturday at the mall buying gifts to announce it to my husband's family soon.\n\nWe had our first prenatal appointment, everything was great. We got our packet of papers, information, how to schedule more appointments, etc. We scheduled an ultrasound for the next day, because my family has a history of twins.\n\nI'm not going to go too far into the ultrasound because it's still incredibly triggering for me. I'm tearing up just thinking about it and it's been a full year and a half. There's a post in my history about it, but it's on /r/babybumps. Anyway, it was a horrific experience, followed by a good hour of sobbing in the parking lot because I was 100% convinced something was wrong. We had to wait a full day to meet with the midwife, where she confirmed what I'd already known. Our baby was gone, and had been gone for a week or two. That time at the mall, we didn't even have a baby at that point. We announced on the 4th, and it passed somewhere in the next four days. But, the midwife had good news: \"At least you know you can get pregnant.\"\n\n\nI went home, took my Cytotec, and spent a few days crying. I watched all of Nurse Jackie curled up in my bed, miserable. Then I had to soldier on, because I was scheduled to attend a conference for work - one I'd really been looking forward to. Instead I could barely keep from crying, trying to keep it a secret from my coworker who'd come with, and going back to my hotel room to take some percocet and cry some more.\n\n\nIn retrospect, this left me with some PTSD. The entire thing was just so horrible for me, from the ultrasound to the doctor's office to the conference. I think of it all with a grey haze, and if the haze lifts at all, I just...can't handle it. Honestly, that's why I'm here. My therapist wants me to talk about it more, with people who understand.\n\nAfter the first miscarriage, we had a few months off. Tried again, got pregnant again pretty quick! But had another miscarriage. I was already so anxious about it happening again that I was almost expecting it. It hurt, but not nearly as bad as the first one. By this point, I was more mad at the clinic system I was using. I ended up switching clinics, partly due to anger and their incompetence, partly due to them being triggering for me now, and partly for convenience.\n\nWe kept trying to get pregnant again for the next 9 months, with no success. Finally, a few months ago we took a break, put an IUD in, and gave it a rest. It did WONDERS for my mental health. Since June I've been in treatment for an eating disorder (binge eating, which got way worse when this all happened), along with my general depression and anxiety (issues that already existed before this all happened). Then add in some trauma, some PTSD, and here we are.\n\nWhenever I think of all this, I just feel like I should be \"over it\" by now. It's been a year and a half - plenty of people have miscarriages and move on with their lives. But I still just feel crippled by mine. I feel like a lot of people have it worse, too. Like, I only had two. I'm still (probably) fertile. I didn't have a stillbirth, or any of the other amazingly difficult things people go through. So why am I complaining?\n\nI still can't think about a lot of stuff, I still avoid a lot of things. My best friend at work is pregnant and I thought I was doing better - she told me and I was legitimately excited! Then she showed me the ultrasound pic and whoops, turns out those are a HUGE trigger for me now. So that kind of kicked in a lot of the jealous again, especially because her first baby is the whole reason my husband and I decided we were ready to TTC.\n\nAnyway, I'm not sure I really expect anyone to read all this. I'm just trying to get it off my chest and try to share a little with people who have been through something similar. My therapist has been super helpful and I love her to bits, but she hasn't been down this road. We've been working on a lot of the \"I should be over it\" thoughts and the \"my experience isn't as bad as others\" thoughts, but she really feels I need support from people who've been through it, and I'm too emotionally stopped up to talk about this in person.\n\nMy husband's amazing, but he doesn't get it from my side, and I feel bad for not being as resilient as he seems to have been. My friend is pregnant, my other friend is having to take a break from TTC because of marriage difficulties so I can't talk about it with her, my mom's no good for this...\n\nAnyway, thanks for listening, if you read all this. I'm glad to be around, and I hope I can be helpful to others around here too. Sorry for this post being such a downer - outside of this, I do a lot of cool stuff too - I crochet, I cross-stitch, I'm learning how to play Pathfinder, I play Overwatch, and am just generally a huge nerd.\n\nIf anybody wants to talk or has any questions about what I've been through, including the general mental health stuff, you're welcome to ask.", "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "ttcafterloss", "subreddit_id": "t5_34scd", "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Late Introduction [missed Miscarriage, PTSD]", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/ttcafterloss/comments/7qm2co/late_introduction_missed_miscarriage_ptsd/"}, {"author": "NursePoop", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_text": null, "brand_safe": false, "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1516046799, "domain": "self.ttcafterloss", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/ttcafterloss/comments/7qme4y/does_anyone_have_any_insight_to_recurrent/", "id": "7qme4y", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "locked": false, "num_comments": 17, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/ttcafterloss/comments/7qme4y/does_anyone_have_any_insight_to_recurrent/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1516105159, "score": 6, "selftext": "I know this isn't a medical advice sub but I'm hoping someone may have some insight as to what's going on with me\n\nMe: 30F, four miscarriages, all with massive hematomas preceding hemorrhagic miscarriage. \n\nI've had all the panel of tests done and all come back normal - but this sounds like some sort of thrombophilia or clotting disorder. \n\nMy doctor doesn't think so.

We're so incredibly excited to be parents, and the day he told me he was ready to start trying was the most exciting day of my life so far. \n\nOn cycle 4 of trying, my period was due January 9th. I was feeling weirdly confident that this was the month, but didn't get my hopes up too far. On January 7th, I started my typical pre-period spotting. I drank some wine and came to terms with it not being our month. \n\nHowever, by January 9th, my period still had not started. On the 10th, I took a test and got a very faint but definitely visible positive! Cue total freak out. Went out and bought 5 more tests, got positives on 3 of them but negatives on the digital tests. I assumed it was just because the digitals are less sensitive, let myself get excited and told my husband!\n\nThe next morning, though, I took another test and the positive was fainter than the day before, and I noticed some spotting. I still stayed cautiously optimistic and made an appointment with an OBGYN.\n\nBut by the 11th, the spotting had increased, my positive was almost invisible, and I just knew it was over. On the 12th, I started the heaviest period of my life, and i knew that I had had a chemical pregnancy. \n\nI don't like using the term chemical pregnancy, though. I had a miscarriage, and while it was early, I was so incredibly excited and in love with that baby. Losing it was completely devastating, and I don't think I'll ever forget my first positive pregnancy test, my first baby. \n\nWe discussed waiting for a while to try again, but I bought some OPK's and will be trying again this month. I'm nervous though. I can't see myself getting excited if I have a positive test this month. I'm worried that I'll be a depressed nervous wreck assuming that it will be another CP or miscarriage. \n\nI haven't really had anywhere to talk about this, so I'm glad I found this community. Other subs and online forums have seemed a little dismissive of chemical pregnancies, since they're so early it seems like some people don't think they can be as devastating as this was for my husband and me. \n\nThank you for listening, and thank you for letting me be a part of this community.

That felt nice because after being dismissed by the ER staff and then my In-Laws (due to their unhealthy levels of optimism) he was flat-out like \"Your injury was as bad as a gunshot.\" with no hesitation or qualifiers. Another woman had a conversation with me where she expressed how sorry she was that I lost the baby and shared that she had lost a pregnancy at 20 weeks and that she was there if I wanted to talk.\n\n\nI was pretty wiped out at the half-way point and went to work from home the rest of the day, so I might just go in for meetings this week.

I don't know what the reasoning was, but it didn't work out. \n\nAnyway, we are trying again, pretty much as soon as I was able, we were trying again.

This pregnancy was a huge surprise though we have been ttc our second for 6 months (including a chemical pregnancy in sept.). I was supposed to ovulate on Nov. 16th but apparently didn't. I took 3 pregnancy tests in early December, all negative, and chalked it up to an anovulatory cycle. I got a prescription for provera, took all 10 pills diligently, but 10 days after stopping provera, there was no withdrawal bleeding. I went in for an ultrasound to see what was up, thinking maybe my lining was too thin to result in bleeding. Lo and behold! I was pregnant--I had spontaneously ovulated mid-December. I panicked, because it had never occurred to me I could be pregnant and I had not been behaving like a pregnant person. This whole week was an emotional roller coaster in which I counted and recounted every drink I had over the holidays, googled teratogenic effects of every medication I took, and generally attempted to wrap my head around this turn of events. Then, today, on the repeat ultrasound there was no heartbeat and literally no growth. They think the baby died within 24 hours of my first ultrasound. And obviously, I am convinced this is my fault--either for said misbehavior before I realized I was pregnant or for being so stressed this week.\n\nSo, I have to decide if I want to do cytotec or a D&amp;C.

We ended up talking to them and I tried not to show how sad I was. Ultimately, I was so happy for them and would never want anyone to feel guilty about their happy situation. At the end of the night she approached me and said she wanted to acknowledge our loss and was so very sweet. At the end of it all, my husband and I made new friends in this couple. They have also had a hell of a journey and experienced their own losses. So even though it was triggering to begin with, I\u2019m thankful that we met them.\nAlso, I had a traumatic experience at the reception with my first pp period and I messed up my dress. I drank a lot and danced it off. This was such a hard, triggering, very traumatic weekend and I\u2019m so damn glad it\u2019s over. Here\u2019s to better weekends!

At our 7 week appointment (which I knew was 7+3 due to ovulation tracking) the baby measured 6+3. We saw a heartbeat and everything was great - the doctor didn't mention anything was a problem with it growing a bit slowly. I've since read that it happens and is usually okay. At our 11 week Doppler, the OB tried finding the heartbeat to no avail. Said sometimes it's hard to find it this early, but we were definitely feeling worried. Went in with the u/s and was taking his sweet time. The whole thing felt SO unreal - like a horrible horrible dream... He finally printed some stuff and turned the screen around to show that the fetus stopped growing at 8+3. No heartbeat. I was told it was nothing I did, and it can happen this early etc etc. We scheduled a D&amp;C for 3 days after. Didn't cry too much till we made it to the car - then there were lots of tears for a couple of days (and still almost daily now). This was probably the worst day of my life. I'm a huge planner, and in my mind I'd planned the 9 months out (and after) and this is really hard for me to deal with on that front too...\n\nNow it's about 2 weeks later and I feel fine physically and starting to recover emotionally. I've been mostly lurking in this sub, but feel like I can share my story and post more now. It's been sad reading others that have gone through similar situations, but it's so good to see there's a supportive hopeful community built around the sadness.\n\nAnyway.. like I said, I'm a big planner, and this helps me cope also. I need to throw myself back into some non-TTC-related goals! So I was wondering, now that we are going to TTC again (and I assume many here are as well), what are some things you all are doing \"better\" and what goals are you getting back to this go round? \n\n I'm going back to pursuing my weightlifting goals and getting back into gymnastics (both I put on pause once I got a BFP). Also having more energy now will help. Maybe I'll sign up for a spring 5k! We're hoping to buy a house soon, so I'm going to start the purging process (really had no energy for that before) and also concentrate on researching/searching for houses rather than be super distracted by pregnancy things. Some new goals that I wouldn't necessarily be unable to pursue after a BFP - reconnect more with old friends. This MC has really opened my eyes on the importance of loved ones and their support. \n\nIn terms of doing things \"better\" this go round... We're drinking less now (started that before the first BFP too but pretty sure we conceived after a drunken Halloween weekend). I'm going to find what exercises, such as ones for the pelvic floor, are good to be able to do during/after pregnancy so I can have a heads up about that. \nWhat are you all doing better now or what goals are you pursuing again? \nI'd just like to say that I'm happy this community exists.

However, we have decided we want a legacy for Millie through donation to research for Downs or organ donation.\n\n\nDoes anyone have any suggestions here in the US?\n", "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "ttcafterloss", "subreddit_id": "t5_34scd", "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "X-Post Infertility, Downs, 35 week stillborn, US donor options?", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/ttcafterloss/comments/7seitw/xpost_infertility_downs_35_week_stillborn_us/"}, {"author": "mandingles", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "brand_safe": false, "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1516717421, "domain": "self.ttcafterloss", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/ttcafterloss/comments/7sep8x/not_compatible_with_life_xpost_from_rmiscarriage/", "id": "7sep8x", "is_crosspostable": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "num_comments": 15, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/ttcafterloss/comments/7sep8x/not_compatible_with_life_xpost_from_rmiscarriage/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1516765443, "rte_mode": "markdown", "score": 1, "selftext": "[removed]", "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "ttcafterloss", "subreddit_id": "t5_34scd", "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "default", "title": "Not compatible with life (x-post from r/miscarriage because it doesn\u2019t really fit there)", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/ttcafterloss/comments/7sep8x/not_compatible_with_life_xpost_from_rmiscarriage/"}, {"author": "Mrscotenp", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "brand_safe": false, "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1516748703, "domain": "self.ttcafterloss", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/ttcafterloss/comments/7sillh/celeb_triggers_vent/", "id": "7sillh", "is_crosspostable": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "num_comments": 2, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/ttcafterloss/comments/7sillh/celeb_triggers_vent/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1516810533, "rte_mode": "markdown", "score": 1, "selftext": "[removed]", "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "ttcafterloss", "subreddit_id": "t5_34scd", "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "default", "title": "Celeb triggers (vent)", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/ttcafterloss/comments/7sillh/celeb_triggers_vent/"}, {"author": "JessesGirl3864", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "brand_safe": false, "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1516753039, "domain": "self.ttcafterloss", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/ttcafterloss/comments/7sj3lc/finally_got_good_news/", "id": "7sj3lc", "is_crosspostable": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "num_comments": 1, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/ttcafterloss/comments/7sj3lc/finally_got_good_news/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1516814574, "rte_mode": "markdown", "score": 1, "selftext": "[removed]", "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "ttcafterloss", "subreddit_id": "t5_34scd", "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "default", "title": "Finally got Good News", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/ttcafterloss/comments/7sj3lc/finally_got_good_news/"}, {"author": "thoughtseeds", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [{"e": "text", "t": "Parker -
