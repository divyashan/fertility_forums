English isn't my native language.\n\n My husband and I decided to try for kids two years ago. I first had to get off methotrexate which I'd been taking for my rheumatoid arthritis (and which is very bad to take firing pregnancy). Had my IUD taken out in November and I got pregnant right away, never even got my period. Miscarried right away as well, over Christmas 2014. \n\nAfter recovery, I got pregnant again in the next cycle in February. The ultrasounds showed two gestational sacs  but at 7.4 weeks there still weren't any heartbeats, so I had a D&amp;C. At that point the husband and I decided to stop trying for a while, and I also started getting therapy for my dysthymia (low-level chronic depression, of course made worse by my general health and the miscarriages). \n\nWe started trying again in July 2015, and by September I was pregnant again. At seven weeks, there was a strong heartbeat on the ultrasound. At 8 weeks, it had stopped. Another D&amp;C, and finally, some tests. Unfortunately, nothing has been found so far. \n\nWell, not really nothing , as my TSH was too high during that least pregnancy. My idiot gynecologist never told me that could be a problem - he knew I have hypothyroidism and I even asked him whether this needed to be checked and he just saw no need. I am still so angry about that - I did get it tested by my GP in the end because I was worried and it was 2.7 that last week (didn't get the results until heartbeat had already stopped...). \n\nI was and still am angry at that. I now have a new gynecologist. \n\nWe're now in the ninth cycle of trying for the fourth time. I am getting so frustrated and impatient... I know that a positive pregnancy test will trigger anxiety and worries, but at least then I can get that over with, you know? \n\nAnyway, that's some of my story. I've been reading through the rules and a few weeks of posts and this community seems really nice, I'm glad to have found it!

Throughout that process, her sister got pregnant and my sister got pregnant. I'm happy to report they both had healthy baby girls and we have two nieces to add to the family tree. \n\nHaving babies in our lives now has just made us want a living child of our own even more. Yesterday, however, my wife just got her period and that was the seven month mark for us trying again. I don't know if it's for that reason, or perhaps it's that if we conceived this month then the due date would be two weeks from our original due date, but the reality of not being pregnant once again was more devastating this time.\n\nMy wife is burnt out both physically and emotionally. I'm not sure how many more of these months we can take. I want to do something for her that will make her feel special and perhaps even raise our spirit about trying again next month. \n\nI was hoping to hear if other couples did anything to help move forward each month after a negative pregnancy test and not just sink into a hole.

It was early - we were a little over six weeks but in the two weeks we knew about the pregnancy before the miscarriage... it was like living in Candyland (albeit one with a lot of indigestion), especially since we had been TTC for about a year (6 months seriously with opks, temping, etc.) and I'm no spring chicken.\n\nThe waves come and go... I get angry and sad at how my body feels now, I get angry and sad at how much I want it to feel pregnant again. I'll feel grateful that my miscarriage came early because hope and future thinking seems to double faster than hcg. I feel my heart opening up to all of the women and couples who have had mcs and stillbirths, who start thinking that their body is an enemy and not a safe home for new life. \n\nSooo we are back at it this cycle. I've found boards like this on the bump and others.... but there is something about the way so many of you write as much and as thoughtfully as you do about your feelings (over just TTC tips) that made me finally want to say something and stop lurking. I've been on the verge of almost taking anything and everything - baby aspirin, vitex, etc. - without talking to my doctor or even telling my husband, but I know that's not the way to go. \n\nI found myself crying when I read so many of your words and about how you've come to understand your experiences. I've talked with close family members and friends about it... but it's funny the way that sharing has made me realize that so many of us suffer in relative silence about this in our everyday lives. I've started feeling like there is this dividing line between women (and couples) who this has happened to and those who it hasn't.\n\nEven through all the negative thoughts and pain... what I do know is that having a mc gave me a perspective on life that I'd never felt before. I can be both afraid of never getting pregnant again and of getting pregnant again (translation miscarrying again). I can both never forget the hopes and dreams I had for the baby we were to have in January and create new ones. \n\nLove to all of you - thank you again for your words.

I haven't told my story yet so who knows what I've got pent up in here. \n\nThis was my first pregnancy and my boyfriend and I had only been trying for one cycle. I miscarried last month after being sent to a military promotion board. These things are meant to induce stress and gauge your reaction to it in order to evaluate your capabilities to act as a noncommissioned officer. I started light spotting the next day, but was reassured by the OB triage nurse the morning after that (\"light brown spotting can be okay, don't worry about it too much and try not to worry\"). I went to the ER that weekend after the spotting turned bright red and was told I was miscarrying, so much for the false hope. The following Monday I was given Misoprostol and completed the miscarriage on June 7. \n\nI had a week and a half off and returned to work still a complete wreck. Even though I was \"only\" 9 weeks along, everyone in my unit knew I was pregnant. I wish I had a job where I could have kept it a secret and kept this loss between myself and my boyfriend, but that's not how the military works. Nobody in my family or any of my pre-military friends knew, so that helped. But work was miserable. Everybody had something to say - the vast majority of it was kind words or offers to help out. Their wives had been through it, etc. But my first day back my leadership approached me wanting a paper saying I was no longer pregnant so that I could return to full duty and go with my unit to the field in a couple weeks. They had been really angry after a third female in our unit had found out she was pregnant. So now that I'm no longer pregnant, I'm good, right? They need the numbers because replacements for PCSs and ETSs haven't shown up yet and I'm just a number after all. Anyway, after holding going to the field over my head for a couple of weeks they finally relented and let me stay back because of my numerous counseling appointments. (I feel like I should point out that I usually have nothing against going to the field. Two weeks without showering, sleeping outside under the stars, lugging equipment around and actually doing my job is NOT an issue. My problem was being surrounded by people, especially the ones I no longer trust, that has been intolerable). \n\nMy boyfriend is currently transitioning out of the military and moving to another state. This is our last chance at TTC before he goes. The week my unit rolled out to the field, my HCG finally hit 3 and I started my period two days after getting the news. If it doesn't work then there's a window around Christmas when I can see him. If not, I won't have another chance until I'm out of the military. I'll be 32 by then. I feel like I've wasted away my fertile years on the military and the wrong men. \n\nLast week was a good week, what with there being fewer people around because most of the others were in the field. But this week I've been in a silent rage mode all week. I'm stressed about how my unit will handle it if I get pregnant again and I'm stressed about how my body will handle it if I don't. Will they react the same way they did as when the third female announced? Will it be too late for me if I wait until I'm out of the military? If I get pregnant, how will I handle it without him around? For that matter, how will I handle it without him around if I don't get pregnant?\n\nThese questions and more are hanging over my head. I won't be able to answer them for another two weeks or so, and in the meantime I'm just so angry. \n", "stickied": false, "subreddit": "ttcafterloss", "subreddit_id": "t5_34scd", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Intro - angry week", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/ttcafterloss/comments/4tt992/intro_angry_week/"}, {"author": "AutoModerator", "author_created_utc": 1325741068, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_text": null, "author_fullname": "t2_6l4z3", "created_utc": 1469084658, "distinguished": "moderator", "domain": "self.ttcafterloss", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/ttcafterloss/comments/4tvs02/ttcafterloss_ttc_daily_discussion_thread_july_21/", "gilded": 0, "id": "4tvs02", "is_self": true, "link_flair_css_class": "ttc", "link_flair_text": "TTC Thread", "locked": false, "media_embed": {}, "num_comments": 65, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/ttcafterloss/comments/4tvs02/ttcafterloss_ttc_daily_discussion_thread_july_21/", "retrieved_on": 1472975082, "score": 2, "secure_media_embed": {}, "selftext": "**This thread is for members who are TTC or waiting to try.

I feel like all those emotions are locked away in a box and I don't know how to get them out. I just feel kinda empty and like i'm going through the motions.\n\nOn the one hand, I feel like this is a blessing. Even if I do get pregnant again, there's no guarantee it will work out, so the less excited I am, the better. But the lack of feeling is making me doubt if this is something I even want to do still. Deep down, I feel like it is, but these conflicting feelings are starting to mess with me. \n\nI spoke to my husband and he said he feels similar. Like there's something preventing him from getting excited because he's scared it will all get ripped away from us again. So it's comforting to know that I'm not the only one feeling this way. But I just hate it. I picture holding my baby in my arms and still feeling empty inside and that makes me sad.\n\nThroughout all the testing, it was discovered that my thyroid levels were a little off, so I started taking medicine for that. The doctor also had me start taking vitamin d and coenzyme Q10 (along with the pre-natal vitamin I'm already taking). So I don't know if any of that could also be contributing to this feeling. \n\nI guess I just wanted to know if any of you lovely ladies had gone through anything similar to this? Also I would love to hear about anyone's experience with Clomid.

I had small amounts of spotting here and there, which really freaked me out, but everything I read said as long as it was not bright red, it was normal. \n\nAt 9w, I began bleeding, bright red, and it was accompanied by moderate cramping. I called my doctor's after-hours line and they assured me that it could be nothing, since I wasn't filling a pad, but made me an appointment the next day. \n\nThe next day, I went for an ultrasound (my first) and all of the sudden on the screen, I see two sacs. Two empty sacs. I knew from creeping on every pregnancy board known to man that there should have been something visible in those sacs at 9 weeks. The u/s tech said she had to have a doctor double-check the measurements and came back to say they were measuring 5w1d and 5w2d. \n\nWent upstairs to see the doctor (I go to a multi-doc practice, this was one I hadn't seen before) and when she walked in, she asked why I was crying. Ughhhhhhhhhhhh I am still so mad about that. \nShe was otherwise kind and said that they couldn't say anything was wrong, they were measuring early, but maybe my dates were off? (I knew my dates were not off, I've been tracking my period for a decade.) They couldn't make any decisions until I had a follow-up u/s. Was told to make an appointment for the following week to re-measure and was sent home, with instructions to call if the bleeding got worse. \n\nSaturday and Sunday were filled with more of the light bleeding, I never filled a pad - but it was heavier than spotting, and some of the worst cramps I've ever felt. Called the doctor again Monday morning and was sent to the ER. Was told that they would page one of the OBs from my practice when I got there. \n\nGot another pelvic exam, another ultrasound, another pee-test and towards the very end, the ER doc told me they were beginning to see signs of a miscarriage. I never saw one of my OBs but was told the doctor called them and they (OB's office) would call me for an appointment the next day. \n\nWent down the next day, doctor told me that she knew it was a very emotional time for me but they have to be very cautious unless there are actual signs of miscarriage, which I hadn't been showing, but now I was. Gave me options and I scheduled a D&amp;C for the next day. \n\nI was having such a hard time coping with this, I knew that I could not handle a natural miscarriage. Also, I wasn't sure if it would be twice as worse since there were two of them? Regardless, I did not want to find out and so much power to those of you that go through the process at home. \n\nD&amp;C was fine, I have been put under a few times, but when they said it was just twilight, I became terrified that I would wake up in the middle. The anesthesiologist assured me that I would not, and sure enough I didn't wake up until it was over. As soon as they removed the oxygen mask, I began sobbing. Due to grief or relief that it was over, (both?) I'm not entirely sure. \n\nHad some severe cramping ~2 hours after the procedure so I took one of the painkillers they gave me, but I've been pretty much pain-free otherwise. Some very very light spotting for the past ~5 days, but looks like that may be done as well.\n\nWhile waiting to find out if I was having a miscarriage, I had contacted the few people that knew I was pregnant, just to give them a heads up and I found 2 of them had miscarried before and I had never known (and one was my sister). I started to write a long blog post about my experience, but decided not to post.\n\nI was part of a fun little twitter group for secretly pregnant people, so I was able to tell some of my story there, but only in 140 character bursts. And now that I'm no longer pregnant, it is not the right place for me. So here I am. Waiting for my period to start up again and trying to decide if I want to try again as soon as I can.\n\nI've left a few comments and you have all been so kind and supportive and I wish that none of us had to be here but I am thankful that there is somewhere to be right now.", "stickied": false, "subreddit": "ttcafterloss", "subreddit_id": "t5_34scd", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "The intro post no one ever wants to write..", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/ttcafterloss/comments/4uvsus/the_intro_post_no_one_ever_wants_to_write/"}, {"author": "iswronmemum", "author_created_utc": 1387893692, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_text": null, "author_fullname": "t2_ehuhk", "created_utc": 1469674207, "domain": "self.ttcafterloss", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/ttcafterloss/comments/4uyiro/things_ive_observed/", "gilded": 0, "id": "4uyiro", "is_self": true, "link_flair_css_class": "discussion", "link_flair_text": "Discussion", "locked": false, "media_embed": {}, "num_comments": 8, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/ttcafterloss/comments/4uyiro/things_ive_observed/", "retrieved_on": 1472994820, "score": 17, "secure_media_embed": {}, "selftext": "Recently my husband and I were away for 10 days to visit family and also celebrate my sisters 10 year anniversary.

A little about me: I'm 24 and TTC our first. My husband and I have been together for 6 years. He's in industrial sales and I'm a civil litigation attorney. \n\nI haven't really taken the time to tell anyone the full story of everything that's happened and because we're just now trying, all these emotions and fears have come up. When I was 18, husband (then boyfriend) and I slept together right before leaving for our freshman year of college. Once. While I was on the pill. Obviously I thought things were fine but 5 weeks later, I clearly things were not ok and I lost it. At the time, I was 7 hours from my family, 13 from my husband and had zero friends. I was completely alone in a tiny town with no access to a car to see a doctor. I couldn't tell my parents because they would be so upset I was ever sleeping with someone, let alone pregnant. I, as far as I know, didn't have any medical problems as a result. When I told my husband, he was 18 too and went out with his friends, leaving me to deal with all my emotions on my own. \n\nNow, it's 6 years later. We decided we felt like she was a girl, gave her a name, and talk about what she would be like. We had decided we would have gone with adoption and talked about how the parents would have had a wild child. But, now we're also trying for our first child and I feel like it was entirely my fault. I can't get over the feeling that I did something wrong and if I hadn't screwed something up, it never would have happened. I'm terrified that it will happen again, even if I do everything right, and I really don't know if I can handle it again. I'm really hopeful things will work out but there's a constant apprehension my husband just does not seem to understand.

First pregnancy was a scary pregnancy due to growth issues inside the womb and the delivery was just as terrifying, but fortunately our daughter made it and we were told the problems we encountered were just bad luck and wouldn't happen again if/when we tried for #2. Once our daughter was getting close to turning 2, we decided that we wanted to try adding onto our family. We were pregnant within a few months, but that pregnancy ended in miscarriage. We decided to try again right away and were once again lucky to become pregnant quickly. That pregnany ended in miscarriage as well. At this point I was starting to get a bit nervous, but all the doctors reassumed me that it was likely just bad luck and that I would have a successful pregnancy if we continued trying. So we did continue to try and it was not too long before we found out we were expecting. I thought this was it and this would be our rainbow baby. Everything about the pregnancy seemed to be going great and we were so thrilled to have what we thought was a textbook perfect pregnancy! Then at 19.5 weeks, during the anatomy scan, we found out our baby had passed away in the womb. Our son was delivered that night and it was the most heart breaking moment of our lives.\nNow my post-partum visit is coming up soon and the testing to find out what is wrong with me will begin. So far it sounds like I have some sort of clotting disorder as there were many clots found within the placenta and they were determined to be the cause of my son's death. We would like try continue trying for a baby but I'm starting to feel like I'm cursed at this point. \nSorry for any misspellings or rambling, my brain seems to have shut off the past few weeks.

I'm also posting from the app so I apologize if any formatting is odd. I'm 27 and my husband is 28 and this was our first pregnancy. We found out we had a miscarriage at our first prenatal appointment on June 23rd. The measurements showed that it had happened about a week before at 8.5 weeks. This was our first pregnancy so needless to say, this was not the way my husband and I had pictured our first pregnancy going (as I'm sure many, if not all of us, feel). I decided to do a D&amp;C and I was able to get in the very next day. It has now been 5 weeks exactly since I had the D&amp;C and today I got my first period since the procedure. I had spotted/bled off and on for 3 weeks followed by 2 weeks of zero spotting/bleeding. I use Fertility Friend to track my temps &amp; CM and I had a pretty reliable 31 day cycle prior to my pregnancy. This cycle (counting the D&amp;C as the first day) was 35 days so I'm trying to take it in stride and chalk it up as a win and see it from the bright side. I'm feeling proud of my body for getting close to being back on track to how it was beforehand. Obviously, I wish I wasn't tracking my fertility and period but that's the card I was dealt and I'll try and make the best of it! Thanks for bearing with my longer post.

I honestly didn't think the emotional pain post D&amp;C would be this difficult.\n\nI had the procedure done three weeks ago, then a spine surgery immediately following. Both procedures went well. Took a while for the dust to settle, but now I feel like I'm in such an incredibly dark place. I worry that I'm putting all this on my s/o, and the last thing I want to do is put more stress on him. He has been incredibly supportive and I know he's dealing with the loss, as well.\n\nIve been having crying spells pretty much constantly. They come out when I least expect it. Everything that has happened to us since, I feel like is some kind of punishment-we've had a string of bad luck and I can't help but feel like it's my fault. My s/o even said yesterday, after a particularly rough day, \"I feel like we're being punished\". The feeling of guilt is strong and I'm praying that it isn't permanent. \n\nHonestly, I'm a generally happy and warm person-these feelings are in an unfamiliar territory for me. I don't want to keep breaking down in front of my s/o. I feel like I should be moving on from this but I'm just stuck. \n\nGuess I'm just reaching out for some encouragement that this does get better. I think most friends and family think it's \"over\" and we've moved on. That's so far from the truth, but I feel weak/scared to reach out to them. I don't want them to think I'm not strong enough to handle this. \n\nThe days are dark and although everyone keeps trying to get me to focus on the good and exciting things to come (we're planning an engagement in the near future), I can't help but focus on the now. The today-the darkness is current and doesn't seem like it's going anywhere anytime soon. \n\nThank you for listening. This is a supportive place and I'm so lucky to have found you. \n-Sarah", "stickied": false, "subreddit": "ttcafterloss", "subreddit_id": "t5_34scd", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Hello again-reaching out in a moment of desperation", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/ttcafterloss/comments/4vhgir/hello_againreaching_out_in_a_moment_of_desperation/"}, {"author": "[deleted]", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": 1470013672, "domain": "self.ttcafterloss", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/ttcafterloss/comments/4vk1mk/anyone_else_with_trying_to_conceive/", "gilded": 0, "id": "4vk1mk", "is_self": true, "locked": false, "media_embed": {}, "num_comments": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/ttcafterloss/comments/4vk1mk/anyone_else_with_trying_to_conceive/", "retrieved_on": 1473005905, "score": 1, "secure_media_embed": {}, "selftext": "[deleted]", "stickied": false, "subreddit": "ttcafterloss", "subreddit_id": "t5_34scd", "thumbnail": "default", "title": "Anyone else with trying to conceive ?", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/ttcafterloss/comments/4vk1mk/anyone_else_with_trying_to_conceive/"}, {"author": "AutoModerator", "author_created_utc": 1325741068, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_text": null, "author_fullname": "t2_6l4z3", "created_utc": 1470035130, "distinguished": "moderator", "domain": "self.ttcafterloss", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/ttcafterloss/comments/4vla7i/ttcafterloss_ttc_daily_discussion_thread_august/", "gilded": 0, "id": "4vla7i", "is_self": true, "link_flair_css_class": "ttc", "link_flair_text": "TTC Thread", "locked": false, "media_embed": {}, "num_comments": 76, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/ttcafterloss/comments/4vla7i/ttcafterloss_ttc_daily_discussion_thread_august/", "retrieved_on": 1473006555, "score": 5, "secure_media_embed": {}, "selftext": "**This thread is for members who are TTC or waiting to try.

Probably one of the toughest things I've ever had to sit through. I immediately called my husband in hysteria and he came home from work. We decided that TFMR was our best option for our family. \n\nAt 14 weeks they told me they could do it in the doctors office, but when I arrived on the day of the procedure, they informed me that it would be with little anesthesia and I would be awake the entire time. I knew I couldn't emotionally handle LISTENING to it, let alone be in excruciating pain during the procedure. So we scheduled for the next week in the hospital. \n\nWhen I arrived at the hospital in the morning, they asked me to sign a bunch of papers, then gave me some pills to dissolve in my mouth that would \"soften my cervix.\"  I was unprepared for what happened next, which I guess was full blown labor. They say me in a busy hallway in a wheelchair as I cried and gasped from the contractions for over an hour. When they finally called me to let me know they had a bed for me I was in so much pain I could hardly even get out of the wheelchair into the bed. The nurse gave me some pain killers, which helped a little, and the doctors performing the surgery, including the anesthesiologist who was amazing, came to talk to me. \n\nI had one request. I wanted his remains to be donated to the school. I did not want him to be thrown in the trash. I don't think I could have coped with this termination if he was being thrown in the trash. I loved him. I wanted his ill fated life to mean something. The doctors were overwhelmed when I requested that of them, and they hugged me and got me the paperwork I needed to sign for them to be able to take him. \n\nI felt like the only way to cope with this was to send him away to science. I feel lonely and empty now. My belly is finally starting to go down and I think at first the large empty belly made me sad, now my flat stomach is doing that instead. I would like a day to go by where I don't cry. I keep waiting and so far it hasn't happened yet. Maybe once I can TTC again I will begin to feel happy but right now I just feel lonely.

They're pregnancies by women who have a greater risk of complications due to health conditions, age, weight, etc.  When they bring you on board, they test for A LOT of things that a standard OB or RE does not test for.  Genetic problems between you and your spouse, blood clotting disorders, etc.\n\nI have a friend who miscarried one of her twins.  When she got pregnant again, she was much older and saw one of these doctors.  Turns out, she had a minor blood clotting issue, and the fact that she laid on her left side while pregnant likely caused the blood to the right baby's placenta to clot, and choked off the blood supply.  \n\nShe had another friend who had multiple miscarriages.  I believe the number was 4.  This lady had been seeing an RE, and they couldn't answer why she continued miscarrying.  She went to the same high risk OB and found out she had a more serious blood clotting disorder that was choking out the placenta, and she took a pill every day and carried her next pregnancy to term.\n\nI've asked my RE for a referral to my local high risk OB for a preconception consult, where they'll do all that bloodwork and let me know if there's anything more we can do to ensure a healthy pregnancy next time around.\n\nLike I said, this may be completely obvious to many of you, but it was news to me.
