(if you check my post history you'll be able to see it on tfablineporn, same as the others) \n\nMy third at the end of May was my longest pregnancy so far since trying with my partner, I managed to get to about a week and a half after my first positive, again high enough hcg for a positive CBD 1-2 (as well as at first good progression on my FRERs), two days into bleeding I had to go for bloods for what will be my referral to the gynaecologist, my bleeding had stopped so I was concerned as to why it had stopped so early and again requested a beta, which ended up coming back as 1.\n\nJust to add in, I also requested bloods at the start of the previous 2 pregnancies (for peace of mind) which they refused to do, because I quote \"a positive pregnancy test is a positive\". \n\nSo anyway, I had a telephone appointment today with the GP who said about my previous betas showing how its in the non-pregnant range, and how apparently during miscarrying my hcg should still be high, so although I strongly believe I was pregnant they have no evidence I was. They've referred me regardless to the gynaecologist but said in the referral they don't believe I was pregnant?!\n\nMy positive tests each and everytime (and I dont just do one or two, i do in the range of 15+ its a slight obsession of mine due to anxiety of it all) and the bleeding and the size of the clots I lose after these tests tell me differently.\n\nI'm just so confused by it all and to be honest furious the way she spoke to me like I'm either lying or crazy. Again, I categorically know I was pregnant everytime. I had symptoms. I had the positive tests. I had the bleed and clots that seem to inevitabley come after for me. \n\nI've never had a period with clots like the ones I've had with these. Nor has anyone else I've shown them to. I'm worried now the gynaecologist won't take me seriously because of what she said in my referral.\n\nIts just so heartbreaking. Having tried for 13 months and then losing 3 pregnancies in a row the last thing I need is a doctor making out that I'm crazy and wasn't even pregnant.

Sorry, it's long and sort of detailed as I feel like writing about it is helpful to me. \n\nOn May 30 we (my husband and I) went to my regular appointment at 19+4, hoping to hear baby's heartbeat as it had been a month since my last appointment. I'll never forget the moment they told us the baby had no heartbeat, after two failed attempts on the doppler and then an ultrasound.  I fell apart. There really are no words to describe the pain. Then there's the guilt (did I cause this?), the denial (maybe the machine was broken?), and the fear. \n\nHe had stopped growing at around 18+5 (estimate). I was given the choice between induction and a d&amp;e. Initially I thought I wanted the d&amp;e because I felt like labor would be too traumatic. But they informed me it was a 4 day wait for an operating room for a d&amp;e, and I learned I wouldn't have the option to cremate. So I slept on it and decided to go through labor.\n\nOn the 31st my mom, husband and I went to labor and delivery. I had a bad reaction to pretty much every drug I took, including the induction medicine which caused a fever pretty much the whole time. About 20 hours after the first inset my baby boy was born at 19+6, and we named him Leo. The epidural hadn't worked and only numbed up to the bottom of my hips, so I felt all the contractions fully.\n\nWe held him for about an hour and I played him a song. It was the saddest thing I've ever done in my life. Fortunately I got a memory box with some foot prints and pictures, as well as his blanket and hat. He was a beautiful baby, but it killed me to see how small he was. I'm really glad I decided on the induction, because now I have memories and things to cherish and help me grieve. I look at his stuff pretty much every day. \n\nA few days into the post-birth grief haze I began to feel sick and a burning when I pee. I called the hospital's nurse line and left a message, figuring I had a UTI. The next day I woke up with really bad back pain and got an appointment to get some antibiotics. Unfortunately it was a bit too late as that night I spiked a fever and ended up in the emergency room. I spent 4 more nights in the hospital for a very unpleasant kidney infection.\n\nWhile in the hospital they let me know I tested positive on all three tests for antiphospholipid syndrome. I need to be re tested in three months to confirm a diagnosis of APS, which causes blood clots and miscarriage/stillbirth. The doctor informed me that three positives make me more likely to test positive the second time but they don't want to put me on any blood thinners yet, but I got to wear these massagers on my legs to prevent blood clots while I was there. So now I'm just waiting to find out if I have it or not. Fortunately it can be treated and people can go on to have successful pregnancies. \n\nTrying to find a place of acceptance is very hard. I miss my son more than I ever thought possible. We got his ashes back yesterday and it feels good to have them home with us. I am trying to support both my own grieving and my husband's as well, as he has had to go back to work which I know is hard on him. I'm trying to adjust to the new reality that I am not having a baby anymore.\n\nWe haven't even thought of when we will try for another baby. I need to wait at least three months for my APS testing, and it's hard to imagine being able to be pregnant again while I'm still having flashbacks and nightmares, in a depression/anxiety haze each day. I imagine one day we'll know when the time is right, and when the fear is no longer overpowering.\n\nI know I'm not the only one here who's had a loss around this time, and to anyone who is reading this in the future as they look for answers and support, I will tell you that you are stronger than you know, and capable of enduring more than you think.", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "ttcafterloss", "subreddit_id": "t5_34scd", "subreddit_subscribers": 5604, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Ready to share my story here", "total_awards_received": 0, "updated_utc": 1560693328, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/ttcafterloss/comments/c0xjbg/ready_to_share_my_story_here/"}, {"all_awardings": [], "author": "Lightofmine215", "author_flair_background_color": "", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_template_id": "b22615aa-711f-11e4-97ba-12313b0e92a7", "author_flair_text": "TFMR 21w, 2/15/19", "author_flair_text_color": "dark", "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_39ypfp47", "author_patreon_flair": false, "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1560608255, "domain": "self.ttcafterloss", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/ttcafterloss/comments/c0xr2n/my_best_friends_baby/", "gildings": {}, "id": "c0xr2n", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 6, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/ttcafterloss/comments/c0xr2n/my_best_friends_baby/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1560608257, "score": 44, "selftext": "My due date is 10 days away and my best friend just gave birth to her daughter today.

I would be 13w2d today and found out about the missed miscarriage on Tuesday.  I had a very healthy us at 9w1d and baby measured perfectly with strong HB.  I couldn't find it with my Doppler anymore close to 10w and midwife didn't at 11w....so when I went in for my nuchal scan at 12w5d  I was scared and worried, but trying to hold onto hope for an anterior placenta.  I wanted to be wrong.  After all the odds should have been on my side, right?  Unfortunately I was right and I knew as soon as she looked at the screen.  Baby measured after 10w and the doctor said there was no sign of abnormality.  I had no bleeding up to that point.  \n\nSince then I've had steady cramping and heavier bleeding each day and am waiting to pass the baby/placenta.\n\nAnd yet.  At the time when we usually would have shared with everyone good news, after this ultrasound, I can't bring myself even to tell my children.  My husband is the only one short of the doctors, that knew.  I don't want to tell my dad.  I find myself acting disturbingly normal in front of my friends while I am so lost and sad inside.\nIt's not like it's my first loss but it's still devastating.  \nI spent my birthday this year having an earlier miscarriage and literally had to attend a surprise party bleeding heavily in the middle of it and didn't say a word.  What was I to say?  Thanks for showing love but here's my horrible news?  I never told any of them.\n\nAnd now I'm waiting for a much later loss, my daughter has grad banquet tomorrow night and I have to stand up and speak and I'm scared to have this loss interfere that they don't even know about....but not wanting to take away from her day whatsoever.\n\nI hate to bear it alone but I also hate the comments people sometimes make....worse in some ways because I do have kids already and am older.  I just feel too tender to hear it.  And I can't stand the look of pity.  I don't want to start crying in public because I probably won't be able to stop.  What's wrong with me that I feel so ashamed and hold this to myself?  I'm supposed to be living in community with some of these people and I don't even tell them.

This was my second pregnancy, the first one was an easy one that resulted in my beautiful 2.5yo son. I should have been 8+6 today, but nature decided otherwise. I started bleeding yesterday and as the hours passed by, it became obvious what was going on. I emailed my doctor and she was able to se my this morning for a quick check at the hospital where she was on call. She confirmed at had a \"spontaneous abortion\" and that most of what used to be was already gone. It felt oddly reassuring to know the fetus had already pass and that I wouldn't need any medical assistance. But the worst part was having to sit in this hallway with all these bumps around me and literally hearing heartbeats coming from the US around me, because the midwife insisted I sit at that exact spot and hospital checkup rooms here (I live abroad, in Latvia) don't have doors.\n\nIt just felt so cruel, seeing and hearing life all around me when I had just produced death. I wouldn't wish that on anyone. I had seen the heartbeat at 7+3 but was measuring at 6+5. Doctor kept telling me everything looked good but somehow it felt like something was wrong. Since she had squeezed me in she couldn't talk much. She was very much medically orientated (\"I can confirm it's a spontaneous abortion, everything is almost gone already\") but I'm seeing her on Friday for what should have been my second US. But except making sure it's healing properly, I'm not sure I'll get any answers. \n\nI just feel so empty right now. I don't even know what to do with myself. I just want to not feel. My husband and I really wanted another baby but now I'm terrified I'm broken. The \"what if\" are flying all around me: if I get pregnant again, how will I be able to cope with the constant \"what if\" that leads to a healthy baby? How will I be able to go to the bathroom without expecting to see blood? How can I put myself through this? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI know it's a super long one, but I just needed to tell someone and this seemed like that one place I would be understood.

But when I got my hands on a copy of those results I realised they literally only confirm that the sample was \u2018product of conception\u2019 and didn\u2019t refer to any testing at all. I was a bit upset after waiting 12 weeks for that and the receptionist told me I could have an appointment with a nurse to discuss things. \n\nThe nurse agreed that it looked like there hadn\u2019t been any testing carried out, and it was too late now for that. So she offered me just a general blood test to test my hormone levels (testosterone/progesterone), which I had done last week. \n\nI temp every day and track my cycles (have done for around 18 months now) and I was roughly 10-11dpo at the point when they took my blood, (give or take a few days as I was a bit ill around ovulation which might have masked my exact ovulation day) and the results came back with this note on my progesterone:\n\n\u201cProgesterone &lt;16 nmol/L: Ovulation unlikely to have occurred.

Our daughter was born at 27w2d in 2016 after a failed procedure to try and combat her fetal anemia.  My husband and I have different blood types (he has a rare one that isn't typically tested for), and I developed some aggressive antibodies which resulted in her being affected.  We have a 50/50 shot of the same anemia problems happening, although in experienced MFM hands the survival rate is about 90%, sometimes higher.  We were exploring IVF and PGD but stalled out with the $$, and found out in January of this year that we were unexpectedly expecting again.  In the midst of all the appointments to try and find a better experienced MFM, we discovered a MMC on 3/13, and did a d&amp;c on 3/15.  It was determined that it was another girl, with trisomy 21.\n\nWe decided to officially TTC a few weeks ago with a good MFM on board and a possible clinical trial to explore, so we NTNP last month and this month it is full on TTC.

I got pregnant the first time at 27 while on the birth control pill. Knowing that I had pcos and had actually tried for years naturally before that in a previous relationship. I was stoaked! Well I lost my son unfortunately at 16 weeks due to premature rupture of membranes. It basically killed me emotionally. Almost a year later the month after my first round of clomid I was pregnant again. My hcg was only 200 something and I should of been around 5 weeks. They monitored it and it did reach 9553 at last count. But they eventually discovered on ultrasound at 12 ish weeks that baby was in my left tube. Another huge blow. Got methotrexate to end the pregnancy. Tube left intact. Never got my period back had to take provera.(note that I am not one of those with pcos who doesn't have a period for months.) Tried clomid again with 21 day draws this time, progesterone was only 5.8 and I was told I didn't ovulate. Well I got pregnant so I must have and sadly it turned out to be chemical. Two months later clomid cycle again no dose Increase despite my asking and yet again low progesterone didn't ovulate but I did because I got pregnant again. Low hcg again at only 13 for two weeks no decrease but no increase either. That ended in a trip to er because I had one sided pain and I knew it was ectopic and it was after hours so I went. It was discovered that I was in fact experiencing ectopic pregnancy again but that this time it was multiples. More methotrexate. Then the very next cycle chemical wasn't even trying. At this point I was emotionally jacked up. So here I am almost a year after the last ectopic. I started taking the pill again to manage my pcos while I figured out what the hell I want to do. Well we want to try again and I reached out to my ob to see if I should stop the pill and immediately start the double dose of clomid like we had planned before I just shut it all down. Or should I wait a cycle to see if the pill helps first. And she said I had to make my annual appointment and we would discuss then. So I messaged about making an appointment. So now I'm waiting for that to be scheduled. We were planning on my last pill pack to be July and maybe make a baby while on vacation the first bit of August. I'm just so scared that this will never happen for me. I wish my doctor could at least discuss some of my options for me to mull over before the appointment, but she just wants to wait so I'm already making myself crazy and I haven't even stopped the pill yet...\ud83e\udd26\u200d\u2640\ufe0f has anyone gone through something similar and was successful eventually or am I doomed to have another ectopic or miscarriage?", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "ttcafterloss", "subreddit_id": "t5_34scd", "subreddit_subscribers": 5619, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Is this a lost cause?/My story", "total_awards_received": 0, "updated_utc": 1560989763, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/ttcafterloss/comments/c2a0l3/is_this_a_lost_causemy_story/"}, {"all_awardings": [], "author": "AutoModerator", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_6l4z3", "author_patreon_flair": false, "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1560928298, "domain": "self.ttcafterloss", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/ttcafterloss/comments/c2dwm0/ttcafterloss_daily_discussion_thread_1_june_19/", "gildings": {}, "id": "c2dwm0", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 6, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/ttcafterloss/comments/c2dwm0/ttcafterloss_daily_discussion_thread_1_june_19/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1560928299, "score": 1, "selftext": "**How are you doing today?

And I feel so dumb about it all. \n\nI am extremely tough on myself, always have been. I also have OCD (its fairly mild - stopped all medications last month) so I naturally have been obsessing about getting pregnant since we started. That, coupled with my anxiety has led me into a whirlwind since my CP and realizing I am now 6 months TTC without a pregnancy. My mom was 36 and it took her 5 months. My friends all took 2-3 months. Whats going on? This is my thought process... I know it can be irrational, 6 months is not very long at all, whatsoever (although by OB did say to come in at 6 months if we haven't  conceived yet).\n\nAnyway, I was starting to accept my pain and was finding ways to just let it be when my husband and I had a conversation a few days ago. Since the CP, I have either been irrationally angry or tearful and sad. Apparently he hadn't even noticed until we got into a fight about something really stupid, and I mentioned that I'm hurt because he cant see how upset I've been. \n\nHe then told me that he's concerned about my mental health because he questions whether I was pregnant in the first place. I just felt everything around me shatter. How could my husband question me like that? He explained because I was obsessing so much over getting pregnant and the lines were faint. Getting stronger, but faint. I once again reminded him that my blood test was positive and that my OB confirmed I was pregnant, but that from my betas it was clear that was either not going to last or it was very very early. He apologized, claimed he didnt know that (I know i told him but whatever), and now feels terrible. I spent the rest of the day in a gray haze again, switching between tearful moments and snapping anger. He and I have a wonderful relationship... he is a great, amazing, respectful man. We are super open with our feelings and I will always cherish that. But this really hurt.\n\nI know I am depressed. I have to be dragged out of the house to be social. I have gained 5 pounds. I have zero motivation. I cry daily, multiple times a day. Everything feels so dark, constantly, topped off with suicidal ideations (which I am 100% confident I would never act on). I am a chronic pain sufferer and this week alone I have taken my opiates every single night (which I have successfully managed to stay away from nearly completely for months TTC) since I have been at a 7/10 almost all day every day. I work a high-stress job and have to be 100% always and I'm barely at 50%. I work billable hours and I was short of my goal last month and this month is looking quite the same.\n\nI knew I was pregnant for about 5 days before I lost it. It was a CP. No heartbeat yet, no scans. Just a few positive pee sticks and a barely there blood test. How could I be this upset? How could I fall apart? I know my husband is criticizing me for how I feel, although he hasnt gone that far to actually say it. \n\nIn the mean time, I just have literally no one to talk to about it because everyone I have told either does not understand why I am so upset or has told me it will happen again soon. But to me it is not about happening again. It is about the fact that it did happen, and then it was gone.\n\nI just feel so broken. Broken from the loss, from my husband's reaction, from feeling broken in the first place. How could I honestly get this upset? I will defend it until the end though.

I have had 3 MCs total (1 MMC @ 19w in May 2017, then 2 CPs since July 2018). We were on our 13th cycle of actively TTC when I found out (TW) that I am pregnant. I am currently 5+2. This is my fourth pregnancy. I was referred to this wonderful clinic in my city that is called the Early Pregnancy Assessment Unit. They are a fertility clinic but without IVF. I have been referred to the fertility clinic, but where I am in Canada, it takes ages to get an appointment. My referral was made in March and I still have not been called for an appointment. I'll be lucky to get in there by the end of the year. \n\nAnyway, this new unit ordered a bunch of bloodwork and we found out I have high TSH. It came in at 17.18 and doctor's recommended a TSH under 2.5 when TTC. I have now been prescribed a synthyroid which will help get my TSH under control. We figured that was one of the main contributing factors to our recurrent pregnancy loss, until we received a call from this new unit. Our karotyping results were in and to my surprise, my results were normal. Unfortunately, my husband's were not. He has a chromosomal disorder called Balanced Translocation (BT), which can result in an unequal balance of two specific chromosomes. \n\nAs most of you know, on average, 25% pregnancies ends in miscarriage. With my husband's BT, we have to add 50% to that. So, 75% of our pregnancies will result in miscarriage. That number is a little hard to wrap my head around. While it's not impossible to naturally get pregnant and carry a baby to term, it's going to be a difficult journey that will likely be filled with even more loss. \n\nWe have been referred to a genetic counsellor so we will have a better idea of what the scope of this specific translocation is.

I had been trying, she had not.   I have a very good, loving, stable marriage...she does not.  She is still pregnant, i am not.   This is not a post about who \u201cdeserves\u201d to be pregnant, this is solely background information.   \n\nWhen i miscarried I distanced myself from the relationship because the world is a cruel and unfair place yet i did not want to be.  My grief has included a lot of misdirected anger, mostly at her situation (long story, but i stress the world misdirected).  In my grief i did not want to be cruel and unfair to my friend so i haven\u2019t been able to bring myself to talk to her.  She found out about our miscarriage via my husband, who she also has a good relationship.  He told her that we had lost our baby and was taking it very hard but i was ok and not to worry, she would hear from me when i was ready to talk.    \n\nThis was the first week of June.  I wanted to wait to speak with my therapist who\u2019s been out of the office (again, the world is cruel and unfair), before attempting to talk to my friend and potentially saying things that would hurt her/our friendship.  She has been sporadically texting memes/gifs of encouragement that i have no responded to (again, my husband told her i was struggle and would call when i was ready).  \n\nWell yesterday she announced on social media- which i knew would happen eventually...however in light of everything i guess i assumed she would have texted me or my husband a heads up?  \n\nShe had a miscarriage in 2017 so she understands the gut wrenching pain that is pregnancy announcements and i am so unbelievably hurt that she didn\u2019t even attempt to save me from this sucker punch.   I texted her (what i thought was a kind but straight forward message centering on ME and my feelings) mostly so that my hurt was out of my heart and into the open instead of festering....and her reply was essentially to say that if I\u2019d bothered to answer her texts in the last month i wouldn\u2019t have been hurt?  \n\nHere is a bit of her actual text:  \u201cWe announced unexpectedly. Literally 5 min planning. I would have loved to have told you ahead of time and to have you be part of any of this because I love you and I miss you, but you haven\u2019t returned any of my texts or anything  in over a month and I didn\u2019t think me reaching out to give you details would be appreciated\u201d  \n\nAm I totally out of line?   \n\nAll i really wanted was an \u201cI\u2019m sorry\u201d....  Right?   \n\nI feel absolutely crazy about all of this and the lines of normal behavior have a tendency to blur in times of grief.    Not only am i wounded from her not preempting me, but then to deflect and defend instead of just saying \u201cyou\u2019re right, I\u2019m sorry that hurt you and i could\u2019ve prevented it\u201d hurts me further.  I don\u2019t even know how to feel towards her or how to move forward- or if i even want to.   \n\nI\u2019m not sure y\u2019all could even say anything to help, but damn....i hope this makes even a little bit of sense.

In terms of recovering emotionally after our miscarriage, there were a few things that helped us that I thought I\u2019d share here, and maybe hear about what helped you guys, emotionally, during this time.\n\n**Gratitude** \\- It\u2019s hard not to focus on what you\u2019ve lost after a miscarriage, or at least it was for us, but my wife and I found that trying to shift our attention, consistently, to what we already had and being grateful for that made a big difference in moving back to feeling okay. Our marriage, our friends and family, our jobs, our dog\u2026 these are things we could feel grateful for and with a little intention toward thinking this way, we found a bit of relief. I also really tried to assume good intentions from people\u2019s responses. We got all kinds of reactions from \u201cThat\u2019s just so awful\u201d to \u201cAt least you get to have a bunch more sex again\u201d and none of them felt good. We had to try to let the words go and focus on the fact that people cared for us. It felt a lot better that way. \n\n**Control** \\- In every lesson on TTC, but especially this one, we were reminded about what we don\u2019t control. The miscarriage wasn\u2019t our fault, and there\u2019s no point in thinking about what we could\u2019ve done or if it\u2019s going to happen again or if we\u2019re somehow flawed or undeserving. We can\u2019t control the past or future and we can\u2019t really control what happens inside our bodies so, despite feeling utterly shitty sometimes, we had to accept that this can and does and did happen and it\u2019s okay.\n\n**Mindfulness** \\- Man, there are and were a lot of strong emotions with this process. What helped me was to let myself feel shitty, but also try to remain self-aware of my feelings so that they didn\u2019t totally take over. For me it was the difference between *being* and *feeling* sad and angry and depressed and all the other things. I tried saying to myself, \u201cAlright man, the shitty feelings are here, let\u2019s let them in for now,\u201d and though it might sound silly to put it that way, a little mindfulness toward my feelings went a long way in keeping me present and calm. \n\nI wrote more about the journey my wife and I have had and t[he lessons we\u2019ve learned here](http://bestoicbehappy.com/stoicism/pregnancy-quest/), if you\u2019re interested.

This is my third pregnancy. First ended in MMC. Second resulted in my beautiful son who is now 13 months old. This current pregnancy is also a MMC. I found out at 7+6 that baby stopped growing at 6+2. I'm now 11+5 and I still have not miscarried. I've taken a total of 4 rounds of misoprostol (one orally by swallowing pills, one vaginally and two by dissolving under the tongue),  and still no miscarriage. I've only passed two small clots and am now just having light bleeding that is only noticable when I wipe. And by \"light bleeding\" I mean mostly brown discharge with bits of red blood \"specks\" here and there (only way I know to describe it). Only minor cramping here and there.  My Dr made is very clear that should could not prepare me enough for the amount of blood that will result once the process happens, and I've had a follow up ultrasound showing that everything is still there, including baby.  Doc said that she's in no rush if I'm not so I can wait it out if I choose and I would like to avoid a D&amp;C as I do not do well with anesthesia.  \n\nThe first couple of weeks, I was really angry, as I had been with my first MMC. I just couldn't believe this was happening again. I had a D&amp;C the first time around and it took 9 weeks for my HCG levels to go down to zero. It was the worst kind of limbo.  Now, I think I'm able to handle it better because my husband and I have decided to hold off on having another baby for a while (can't wait too long as I'm 38 and clock is probably ticking). Knowing that we won't be trying again any time soon has made things a bit easier, but I still don't feel like my body is mine right now. I'm almost 12 weeks along with a non-viable pregnancy. My baby stopped growing more than 5 weeks ago. Why is my body holding on for so long? What will it take for it to let go? Why didn't the medication work? Will I actually make it to the second trimester even though my baby isn't alive? Oh, did I mention my gestational sac is still growing? How is that even possible?? \n\nWhile the above questions creep in every so often and get to me, having other distractions have certainly helped me to cope. We FINALLY found a house to buy (after more than 6 months of looking) so I'm mostly focused on that, work and family. I'll also probably try to find another job shortly after closing of the house. I think I'm also kind of happy this one didn't work out because I've been sick with a cold or sinus infection or bronchitus or whatever ALL YEAR LONG!!\n\nThanks for letting me rant. As devastating as this all is, I'm actually OK, but I would just like for it to be over so I can properly grieve.
