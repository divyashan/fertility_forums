I noticed that people introduce themselves and their situations on this sub.  So here I am, following suit.  First, I hate that I'm even here (please don't take it the wrong way but, like most of you, I would prefer to not even know about this sub's existence and only be looking at parenting subs). But, clearly - that was not my path - nor any of yours.  Next, I'm also so glad to be here in this community.  I have been reading this sub since my loss, and it has really been a comfort to know that I am not alone.  \n\nMy story is not that unique.  If you are so inclined you can read about it on r/parenting.  Essentially, I received terrible news at my 20 week anatomy scan.  On top of some random other problems (bladder size/lack of anus), my daughter had  open spina bifida. It wasn't in the worst spot on the spine (in fact it was fairly low down), but her brain had already begun swelling with hydrocephalus and malformations.  But the fact that her lesion was low on the spine kept my husband and I so confused about what the diagnosis meant - we felt such incredible hope.    We had decided we wanted to look into fetal surgery to save our daughter.  We spoke with the Children's Hospital of Philly (which has some of the best surgeons in the country for this area) about whether we were candidates.  Unfortunately, we were not.  \n\nWhen I spoke about my daughter's prognosis with my doctors without the surgery - they refused to give a straight answer.  But basically, the worst case scenario was a severely brain damaged girl requiring brain surgeries throughout her life, who may or may not walk, and will definitely need surgery upon birth to fix the spina bifida, and probably create an anus or bladder.  On the other hand - they didn't want to say that she wouldn't have been mostly OK!  It was so confusing.  I wanted to hope, but finally a doctor got real with me and said the chance that she was going to be OK was minuscule and likely she wasn't going to be OK.\n\nTo those ladies that have had a \"gray\" diagnosis.  Ugh.  I'm so sorry.  It was so tough.  I cried almost all day everyday.  It was so hard to decide to terminate her since maybe...MAYBE...there was a chance.  Shouldn't we have taken that chance - for her??  It felt selfish to terminate - I mean - it was.  But we decided to.  Maybe this is an excuse, but I also kept thinking of the life my toddler would have if we kept our baby.  If we ended up having a severely special needs child, my toddler's life would be forever altered.  I didn't want that for her.\n\nSo we terminated.  Approximately 2 weeks after the initial scan showed abnormalities we had our TFMR.  It was uneventful.  I had the laminaria sticks and then the next day went in for a D&amp;E.  I was completely under for the whole procedure.  I had some cramping that day and the next - but the cramps were not even as bad as my period.  I bled for approximately one week, and then spotted for a little over another week.  Now I am in the waiting game for my first period to return.  I hope that happens soon.  My procedure was over a month ago. \n\nI've been taking the high dose folic acid since the procedure and I'm super anxious to get started on TTC.  I know plenty of women on here discuss being afraid to.  I'm having the opposite reaction.  I'm afraid not to get pregnant again.  I'm desperate to have it happen.  With my first daughter we had difficulty getting pregnant and I'm afraid that will be what I go through again.  So, I just want this waiting to be over and to be pregnant again - and eventually, the mother of 2 that I thought I would be this February.  \n\nBut here I am.  I hug my daughter every day and am thankful that I have her through this whole mess.  And what a mess.  But, I'm ready to move on despite the sadness and confusion.

I had a CP in February that ended at 3 or 4 weeks. I actually don\u2019t know how far I was because I have PCOS and my cycles are totally ridiculous. That one was hard but I was ready to give it another go. \n\nI got pregnant on our first cycle of a Clomid in September. We had three ultrasounds because I found out basically right after I conceived. The first two were perfect. I was 6w2d at the second scan and we saw the hb and everything was right on schedule. I had my third and last ultrasound two weeks later on Thursday and there was no heartbeat. The baby measured 6w4d. My OB said the same thing he said when I had my CP - there was just something wrong with the baby and it didn\u2019t make it. I had a d&amp;c on Friday. I\u2019m still very, very sad. This one feels so much worse. \n\nMy husband has already made up his mind that he wants to try again. I do not know if I can do this again. I already worried so much about losing the baby and I felt very emboldened by the fact that we saw the hb, among other things. I was sure it was going to stick.\n\nSo I guess my question is how do you try again and keep your sanity? Everything that gave me reassurance and strength this time means dick because we still ended up losing the baby. I\u2019m thinking of seeing a counselor because I need some coping mechanisms if I am able to get pregnant again. I feel so out of control of pregnancy and my body. I feel like if I get pregnant my worry and anxiety are going to be unmanageable. The thought of trying to get pregnant again is in itself exhausting because it took *such* a long time for it to happen both times.\n\nSorry if this is all over the place.

We\u2019ve been through 1 miscarriage at 11 weeks in 2015 and a still birth at 22 weeks from placental failure in 2017. I  have had tests done including a Sono histogram, blood work to check my thyroid, and antibodies, plus a few other. I am RH negative and my partner is positive. The first time we became pregnant they didn\u2019t check my blood type and did not give me the rhogam shot which is needed so that my body does not attack the baby while it develops. The second time I was pregnant I had bleeding during the pregnancy so I was given extra rhogam shots as a precaution. All the tests I\u2019ve had have come back normal or within normal range, but in the second pregnancy the placenta was 60% none functioning. The doctors keep telling us that we are young and healthy it will happen, and all the other things they say to try and make you feel better. So far we have worked with genetic specialists, and a neonatal specialist. We just recently made a consultation appointment with a fertility endocrinologist specialist, trying to get some sort of answers as to why this is not working for us. I am hopeful that we will have success with the fertility doctor, but nervous that we will continue to have problems or they will decide to not take us on as patients. \n\nI feel conflicted in the aspect that I don\u2019t think I can go through labor and give birth to another still born child, but we want so badly to have a family. The risk seems worth the reward, I just don\u2019t know how much more I can take. Every month when I start my period I feel like a complete failure, my whole large family are very fertile and all have at least 1 child most have 3-4 without any kind of problems. I try to stay positive, but find myself angry when I see people who are not trying to get pregnant or not financially or maturely ready to have children just pumping them out on accident. I have been having trouble socializing with people because of this, it seems like everyone around us is pregnant or have new babies. \n\nI don\u2019t like expressing my feelings when it comes to this matter as I feel like people (who have never had these problems) tell me they understand when unless you\u2019ve been through it you really can\u2019t understand the daily pain and stress.

We\u2019ve been through 1 miscarriage at 11 weeks in 2015 and a still birth at 22 weeks from placental failure in 2017. I  have had tests done including a Sono histogram, blood work to check my thyroid, and antibodies, plus a few other. I am RH negative and my partner is positive. The first time we became pregnant they didn\u2019t check my blood type and did not give me the rhogam shot which is needed so that my body does not attack the baby while it develops. The second time I was pregnant I had bleeding during the pregnancy so I was given extra rhogam shots as a precaution. All the tests I\u2019ve had have come back normal or within normal range, but in the second pregnancy the placenta was 60% none functioning. The doctors keep telling us that we are young and healthy it will happen, and all the other things they say to try and make you feel better. So far we have worked with genetic specialists, and a neonatal specialist. We just recently made a consultation appointment with a fertility endocrinologist specialist, trying to get some sort of answers as to why this is not working for us. I am hopeful that we will have success with the fertility doctor, but nervous that we will continue to have problems or they will decide to not take us on as patients. \n\nI feel conflicted in the aspect that I don\u2019t think I can go through labor and give birth to another still born child, but we want so badly to have a family. The risk seems worth the reward, I just don\u2019t know how much more I can take. Every month when I start my period I feel like a complete failure, my whole large family are very fertile and all have at least 1 child most have 3-4 without any kind of problems. I try to stay positive, but find myself angry when I see people who are not trying to get pregnant or not financially or maturely ready to have children just pumping them out on accident. I have been having trouble socializing with people because of this, it seems like everyone around us is pregnant or have new babies. \n\nI don\u2019t like expressing my feelings when it comes to this matter as I feel like people (who have never had these problems) tell me they understand when unless you\u2019ve been through it you really can\u2019t understand the daily pain and stress.

I am new here. I am 34 years old. I have a little girl that is 12 from a previous marriage. My husband and I just lost our little girl at 19 weeks 2 days due to my water breaking at 16w 1 day. I spent 3 long weeks in the hospital trying my best to keep her with us. No fever/infection. Started having contractions 2 weeks after being in the hospital for 4 days then they stop and nothing for 4 days I felt amazing her heart rate was always great then it happen. I just felt myself loosing her. I thought I was in the clear I had stopped leaking fluid for days. I was excited to think maybe the bag had healed or something but I was wrong. I had Emilia Hope at 12:09 pm on Sunday Sept 30th. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI have never felt so lost in my life. With the holidays coming up I just can't escape this feeling like something is just missing. The last few months have been hard. We lost our sweet baby girl and a week later my husband lost his job due to the company closing. We have moved into his grandma's old house that his cousin has trashed and I am grateful to have it. It's just a lot of work. I feel like I haven't had a moment to breath since we lost Emilia. We have been here for about a month and are just getting a stove and fridge tomorrow. When we first moved in we had no washer or dryer either. Hoping things will feel a little more normal when I get this house sorted. Though we are trying to live out of boxes b.c we know we will be moving again when my husband finds another job. I just feel like I can't relax at all. Like I am always on edge. I am always thinking of Emilia. When even the littlest thing goes wrong I just cry. I feel like i have a cup and it is right on the edge of flowing over then something happens and it just over flows. It was getting better but seems with Thanksgiving coming up that it is just getting worse again. I just was so looking forward to being pregnant this thanks giving and looking forward to having her.

I had an unplanned IUD failure pregnancy in the spring (the IUD was a couple weeks past the 5 year mark, but still, it was a pretty rare situation) that ended in a MMC at 7 weeks. The gestational sac was full of cysts and the baby wasn't developing properly, so they assumed it was a genetic defect, but I've been having some concerning symptoms for months/years and I'm wondering if I could have PCOS and if that could both have caused the miscarriage and may cause problems for me in the future. Obviously I'm not asking strangers on the internet to diagnose me, but I am looking for some guidance.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy symptoms:\n\n\\- My periods have always been regular pre-IUD, but my cycles are actually quite short (21-23 days) and my periods have been very heavy and painful. I don't get periods with the IUD (Mirena) though. (I got it replaced when I had my D+C because the chances of it failing again are so low.)\n\n\\- I was diagnosed with stage 1 endometriosis at 19, but it was all surgically removed and I assumed it hasn't been a problem since. It did definitely decrease the pain with my periods but not the heaviness.\n\n\\- I had HORRIBLE cystic acne until I took spironolactone for about a year and a half several years back. I am no longer on it but thankfully the worst of the acne didn't recur. I still have near-constant minor breakouts on my chin though.\n\n\\- I am quite hairy for a cis woman. I have a goddamn beard. Literally, if I didn't shave or wax I would have a full-on neck beard and hair on other parts of my face as well. I have to shave my chin/neck every few days - honestly it should probably be every day but I'm lazy. The facial hair has gotten a lot worse in the last year or two. There is definitely growth there that wasn't there a year ago.\n\n\\- Weight gain. I'm not obese and am naturally curvy, but I've been steadily gaining weight for the last year or so without a significant change in diet or medication. My weight is mostly in my belly and boobs and I also feel like I have kind of a fat face, TBH.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow, I should note, I did have an ultrasound over two years ago that didn't show any cysts (it was for unexplained abdominal pain that turned out to probably be GI-related), which is good. I had a hormone panel when I was 14 that showed high levels of DHEAS but everything else was in normal ranges. Now, that was 12 years ago and I have not had such a test since.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHonestly, I've suspected this for a couple of years but I haven't talked to my doctor about it for a stupid reason. It's so I can avoid hearing what I don't want to hear. Honestly, I want to be a mom so badly and hearing that I'm mostly infertile or likely to have recurrent miscarriages would completely break my heart. I also can't do fuck all about it for 2-3 years (my fiance doesn't want to start trying for kids until then, and his reasoning for that is sound.)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo, like...what do I do? Is this worth pursuing with my doctor? Could PCOS be what's causing my symptoms and could it have caused my miscarriage? And like if I have it is there anything I could do to increase my chances of getting pregnant and carrying to term, short of doing IVF? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "ttcafterloss", "subreddit_id": "t5_34scd", "subreddit_subscribers": 4204, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Could it be PCOS?", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/ttcafterloss/comments/9ywwxj/could_it_be_pcos/"}, {"author": "Meowkith", "author_flair_background_color": "", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_template_id": "8b677c92-711f-11e4-b63c-12313b0b807d", "author_flair_text": "1MC 8wks, 1/8/2018", "author_flair_text_color": "dark", "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_gf0m7", "author_patreon_flair": false, "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1542756751, "domain": "self.ttcafterloss", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/ttcafterloss/comments/9yxnlx/here_again_i_feel_like_an_imposter/", "gildings": {"gid_1": 0, "gid_2": 0, "gid_3": 0}, "id": "9yxnlx", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_css_class": "intro", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_template_id": "a05e5124-7120-11e4-952e-12313d148545", "link_flair_text": "Intro", "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 18, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/ttcafterloss/comments/9yxnlx/here_again_i_feel_like_an_imposter/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1542756752, "score": 1, "selftext": "This will be my(34f) second early loss, 1st one @9wks(ectopic) and now this one @6wks.

She was so kind, after crying with me (she told me she had suffered 3 losses before her own daughter was born) she sent me home to grieve. I work in a hospital laboratory, which is important to the rest of the story. She pulled me aside today because she sent out a company-wide email with updated information regarding hCG quantitative testing and she wanted to let me know before I read the email in case it was triggering for me. I really appreciate that she thought to tell me that. I feel that I\u2019m coming to terms with my loss (happened at 6w5d, I would have been7w4d today), but I\u2019m still unable to talk about it in person, so it just really meant a lot that she did that, especially since I feel I burdened her by telling her. I really did not plan on telling anyone other than my husband and the little family we had told. \n\nAnyway, I\u2019m new here. Got my first BFP on our first cycle trying and now here I am. I feel a range of emotions. Sadness and defeat because we were so excited for this baby. Hope that we will get pregnant easily again and that this time it will result in a happy ending. Embarrassment that we told my in-laws and my mom and then had to turn around and tell them nevermind. Confusion and anger because I don\u2019t understand why this had to happen. Relief because my doc had been monitoring my HCG and progesterone (not sure why as this was my first pregnancy) so we knew something wasn\u2019t right.

There are some things I wanted to get off my chest. \n\nI had a MMC in the summer. I walked around for 3 weeks without knowing it was already over. I was disappointed but I knew that miscarriage was a possibility. I knew that chances were it wouldn't happen again. Everyone told me the same things that did make me feel better. It wasn't a viable embryo. It happens all the time. \n\nWe conceived after one cycle. I was so nervous and scared. At the ultrasound at 7+6 I cried when they showed me the heartbeat. It measured on time and had a great heartbeat. I thought we were on the good side of the statistics. Just in case I checked the miscarriage reassurance website every day. Got all the way down to 2%. \n\nStarted bleeding. Ultrasound showed the embryo had died a few days after the first ultrasound. I walked around again for a few weeks thinking everything was fine when it wasn't. I felt so devastated. How could this happen twice?\n\nThis time I feel a lot differently. It is not comforting in the least to know that it wasn't a viable embryo. It makes me extra sad to think that we created two bad embryos in a row. I don't think we will be able to move on and feel excited next time about being pregnant. I think it will forever feel like a nightmare waiting to unfold. What's the joy in that?\n\nI don't even know if my husband wants to try again, and I'm hesitant to ask because I don't want him to say no. I don't even know how much I want to try again either, but I also don't want to have been pregnant for six months already this year for nothing. I just don't want to be scared, but the price for that is this empty feeling forever. That's not a fair trade.  \n\nAlso, I hate how quickly I went from happily pregnant to feeling like I was dying in the emergency room to completely recovered and back to normal life. Like, really, it's all over? Just like that? Putting my toddler to sleep at night and watching Netflix. Just like last week except for one thing.

I imagine many of you feel this way too right now. I'm sorry we're here. The wounds are still very raw, but I thought that introducing myself and sharing my story might help me process. I'm sorry this is long and please feel free to scroll past this post if my experience is triggering, but things went from normal to devastating so quickly and I'm still trying to come to terms with what the hell just happened.\n\nAbout two weeks ago, at 13 weeks, I went in for the NT scan. I was so scared about something being wrong with the baby that I didn't consider my body might be the problem. I had a LEEP done in 2009 so they checked my cervix, which is apparently short, raising red flags. The baby looked great (confirmed later with lab results), but I would need a cerclage. The risks seemed minimal and the perinatologist and my OB/GYN both seemed confident this was a simple, preventative measure.\n\nI had a transvaginal cerclage placed last Tuesday. My OB/GYN informed me that it was difficult to place because the doctor who did the LEEP did a shoddy job on my cervix and it's asymmetrical. They put me on indocin for 48 hours to avoid uterine contractions. On Wednesday I was back at work and felt a little cramping and light spotting, but otherwise normal. \n\nBy Thursday, I was no longer on the indocin, and started having horrible, debilitating contractions and a lot of discharge. I was told discharge was normal post-cerclage, but this seemed excessive. They had me come back to the hospital Friday and confirmed I was having contractions. The baby was positioned with her head pushing at my cervix. The cerclage appeared to be unraveling. The ultrasound showed a heartbeat of 144. I remember thinking that seemed low because it had been at 163 before, but 144 is still normal. Amniotic fluid looked fine.\n\nThe doctor was concerned but we seemed to still have options. The goal was to calm my uterus, so she put me back on indocin and ordered immediate bed rest. She called me later that night after mulling further on it and said she was concerned about infection. She ordered blood work and had me come back to the hospital on Saturday, warning me to go to the ER immediately if anything happened between now and then.\n\nOn Saturday, at 15 weeks, I got to the hospital and started bleeding heavily. Since I was already at the hospital, I went to perinatology first to inform them. My perinatologist was on call and my OB/GYN wasn't even on that day, but the nurses were so kind and understanding, and they sent me to labor &amp; delivery to wait. \n\nWhile I waited for the OB/GYN on call, they ordered an ultrasound and the tech said nothing. She called my perinatologist who said she and my OB/GYN were coming in to talk. The ultrasound tech just said, \"I'm sorry.\" I knew then it was over, but I wanted so badly for my doctors to be coming in with an emergency plan.\n\nThe heartbeat that I saw Friday was gone on Saturday. She didn't make it.\n\nMy body clearly couldn't handle the cerclage but there was also infection based on my WBC. I was told that with or without the surgery, this would not have been a viable pregnancy. I'm having such a hard accepting this because things were looking great before the cerclage. And while it likely escalated things, the reality is it was a perfect shitty storm of issues that I never even imagined going into this pregnancy.\n\nFor now, I am focusing on healing my body and my heart, but it's going to be a long road to get back to where I was. It's hard to know how to feel about trying again right now, because I still don't fully understand what happened. \n\nIf it was totally random and infection caused the loss, I have to accept that the odds weren't in my favor and try to have faith that it's less likely to happen again. I will need also a transabdominal cerclage, which they recommend putting in before you start trying, which means I'll have to have another surgery first and eventually try to have faith that it will work this time. I wish it was as easy as just starting to try again, but I will do whatever I have to.\n\nIf you made it this far, thanks for reading my story. I don't know if I'm ready to jump back in yet, but if anyone has experience with transabdominal cerclage, I would love to hear from you.", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "ttcafterloss", "subreddit_id": "t5_34scd", "subreddit_subscribers": 4215, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Struggling to understand", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/ttcafterloss/comments/9zs8qx/struggling_to_understand/"}, {"author": "TacoCat107", "author_flair_background_color": "", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_template_id": "ce4ab51a-711f-11e4-826c-12313d148545", "author_flair_text": "28, TTC #1, MMC 10w 10/27/18, MC 5w 11/1/16", "author_flair_text_color": "dark", "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_1l268w85", "author_patreon_flair": false, "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1543009762, "domain": "self.ttcafterloss", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/ttcafterloss/comments/9zsg0q/tests_still_positive_4_weeks_after_loss/", "gildings": {"gid_1": 0, "gid_2": 0, "gid_3": 0}, "id": "9zsg0q", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 15, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/ttcafterloss/comments/9zsg0q/tests_still_positive_4_weeks_after_loss/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1543009763, "score": 1, "selftext": "I had a MMC and D&amp;C at 10w.

Since graduating college at the ripe old age of 24 (told you, I partied) building a life for myself and setting the foundation to someday have a family has become a focus. I spent the next 6+ years in failed relationship after failed relationship. Never a step closer to happiness and certainly no closer to my forever dream of a someday family. \n\nAbout a year and a half ago, I found myself living a life full of first dates, hardly any second dates, and third dates started to feel like a fairytale. In short, I was burnt out. I didn\u2019t want to keep dating; I was looking for something meaningful and real and lasting. I wanted to give up, but short of finding a magic lamp with a magical genie hiding inside, I knew giving up would get me even that much NOT closer to what I was seeking. \n\nSuddenly, I did find something magical. A man walked into my life who was seemingly average and ordinary at first. The first date was fun, but they all were. I didn\u2019t expect a second date, until he asked for one and I happily complied. Surely that was the end of that - third dates were make believe after all. To my surprise there was a third date, then a forth, and fifth, then suddenly I found myself in a loving and committed relationship. A year and a half later I still look at him with starry-eyes. His love and adoration for me is surpassed only by the love and respect I feel for him. Ok, that\u2019s as mushy as I\u2019m going to get, I promise, just setting the stage. \n\nSo about 11 weeks ago we decided we were ready to take the next step in our relationship. Turned out he wants a family just as deeply as I do. We decided to start trying. Oh, for the sake of keeping this already long post, less long, I skimmed over the fact that we were already living together and engaged at this point. \n\nFortunately, 10 weeks and 4 days ago we became pregnant. We only found out about it 4 weeks and 5 days ago. Horray! We were absolutely elated! We decided, we acted, and it happened! We realized exactly how fortunate we were knowing that becoming pregnant so quickly is quite rare, especially for a couple of our age (32 and 39). \n\nWe decided to wait to announce to our families until an ultrasound confirmed a heartbeat. That would make it real, and all the research we had done assured that after a strong fetal heartbeat had been detected, the risk of miscarriage fell dramatically. We falsely assured ourselves we would be in \u201cthe safe zone.\u201d \n\nThe day of the ultrasound came. Baby\u2019s heartbeat was strong and clear as ever, 159 BPM at 8 weeks. WE WERE HAVING A BABY! A lifelong dream of both of ours being fulfilled. A miracle in the making. We announced on my dad\u2019s birthday by presenting to him a framed sonogram, with my entire family present. We all cried and laughed and hugged. It was a hallmark moment for sure. \n\nThanksgiving, 5 days later, again the whole family was together and conversation focused on the new life growing inside me. Before the evening was over, I went to the bathroom and discovered small blood clots left behind. I panicked, excused myself from the rest of the evening festivities and figured all I needed was a good nights rest. \n\nThe next day, Black Friday, 6 hours in the ER and an ultrasound confirmed that strong fluttering heartbeat was gone, and it would only be a matter of time before my body would expel our little miracle. \n\nWe were pregnant for 10 weeks and 4 days. And now, after 2 days of rest and trying to cope, we\u2019re back to the beginning - wanting to try again, but with a new layer of insecurity and eerie-ness. \n\nI feel defeated. That old, familiar feeling of wanting to give up has sunk in again. I realize that this was only our first \u201ctry\u201d and so many, many couples try for years only to end up disappointed. Considering this I should count myself as lucky that I even made it this far. But this pain is real. Physically I am exhausted, emotionally I am taxed. I do not feel \u201clucky\u201d that I at least got pregnant, even though I lost it. What I do feel \u201clucky\u201d about is that I have this amazing man standing next to me, holding me up and supporting me through what has been the hardest thing I\u2019ve tried to get through in my life so far. \n\nLife is full of crazy, unexplainable, gloriously beautiful and horribly tragic experiences. I\u2019m so glad I have someone to help me navigate them now, and I\u2019m enthusiastic about finding out how the next experience with him will turn out.

I would have been 8w4d but the baby stopped growing sometime last week and there was no heartbeat. We heard a strong heartbeat during our sixth week and breathed a tiny sigh of relief. Here's my story...\n\nIt had taken us over two years to get to this point. I had a devastating diagnosis of severe diminished ovarian reserve last December and underwent 4 IUI ands 2 rounds of ivf. On a strong hunch I suspected endo was also to blame and had a lap done in August and found and removed stage 4. We canceled our ivf in October because my follicle count was barely existent but we had one so we converted to an IUI. We were shocked and elated that the IUI actually worked. I was cautious but with each beta and positive ultrasound I allowed some hope to creep in. My husband was optimistic from the start and I'm crushed for him. I was always cautious, never said I was pregnant outloud, didn't tell anyone, and only spoke in \"ifs\". Infertility ptsd is real and knowing how quickly things could change made me more aware of what could go wrong. He was the opposite and it's heartbreaking to see his hopes crushed so quickly. The words \"I can see the pregnancy but I can't find the heartbeat\" is seared into my brain.  \n\nI'm so angry and afraid. I was always so strong during treatments and proud of how resilient I was but this is too much for me I think. I hate that it's Christmas time and I hate that the baby was due on July 4th which is my favorite holiday. \n\nMy sister just had a baby. It was difficult for me during her pregnancy but I found out I was pregnant a week before she gave birth. It allowed me to feel joy and excitement for her. Thanksgiving was filled with \"baby's first thanksgiving\" and ohhhs and ahhhs over how cute she was. I loved having my little secret bean and became excited to announce to my family at Christmas. I told my husband I may need to go away for Christmas because I don't know if I can be around it right now. \n\nI'm so grateful to find this community right now.

I'm hoping you all might be able to help  me help my best friend through the holidays this year after the loss of her infant last February. \n\nA bit of backstory...last year at this time my best friend and I were pregnant together- she was due in February and I in July. Her entire pregnancy was textbook...her labor...not so much. I can't say much more than that for legal reasons, but I will say that her beautiful daughter lived for one day on life support before taking her off it. \n\nFast forward a few months to May...I am getting bigger and my friend has growing PTSD from their birthing experience. I text and talk with her, but I can tell it's much harder for her to be around me. I send her a letter and a friendship bracelet (cheesy, I know) letting her know that nothing will happen to our friendship, even if we have to drop contact for a while. I just wanted to be there for her, but the circumstances were just overwhelming her. \n\nFast forward a but more...I now have a five month old son. Two other friends of hers have also had kids (both bridesmaids of hers who became pregnant right after she lost her daughter...). \n\nThrough it all, we text, and some talking when she's up for it. I just wish that I could take her pain away, or even help her just a little instead of feeling completely helpless given the impossible circumstances. \n\nMy question is...how can I help her through the holidays and beyond? Is there something that I could do besides just keeping my distance until she's ready (yes, I know that's vital and I'm not about to screw it up).

I live in Japan where even for a healthy pregnancy you have a scan around every 2 weeks until you're 16 weeks pregnant and then monthly until 26 weeks then again more regularly until the birth. Every scan I had was healthy and so were the blood tests - there was nothing indicating this was going to happen. I know that this just happens sometimes, although it's relatively uncommon after the 1st trimester. But, I sort of wish there was a reason. I'm having trouble understanding how something like this can happen when we were both healthy. \n\n18 weeks is sort of the weird limbo stage where I was too far along to pass the baby naturally at home, but too early to try and save the baby. The doctor said that it was extremely unlikely I would make it to 22 weeks, which is the point where they can try and save the baby outside the womb. If I did make it that far, the baby would likely die anyway as it would be extremely underdeveloped because of the lack of amniotic fluid. They hurried my labour along by inserting those stick things into my cervix, then some medicine. Over all I was in labour for around 6 hours. \n\nI live in a small town in the countryside and the maternity unit is extremely small and they don't have babies born every day. The one thing I just can't shake out of my head is the sadness of the nurses. One nurse was crying. It was obviously something they hadn't experienced very often. \n\nAs soon as I get the all clear from the doctor and my periods return, I want to try again for a baby although my husband is hesitant. It seems the advice here is to wait 6 months after a loss. In the UK and US, as far as I can tell (please correct me if I'm wrong) if they doctor says OK then you can start trying as soon as you feel comfortable. One of the hardest things to get used to about being pregnant is just how different the approach is to pregnancy. \n\nMy body has recovered but my mental health is suffering. I can't sleep at all and have anxiety. I wonder if we can ever make a baby again. What if this was my only chance?! What if there is something wrong with me and I can never carry to term? I haven't really spoken to anyone since this has happened, other than my husband and his family. I deleted my Facebook and Instagram. I've been married legally for a while but a month before the loss, we had a wedding ceremony and after we told my family we were expecting. Everyone was so excited. My friend sent me a present to use during pregnancy. It arrived on the day of the baby's funeral. My friend didn't even think to give me a heads up. It would be my parents first grandchild. My mum had started knitting. \n\nI can't face talking to anyone about it, so I just wanted to write something down. Although getting used to the medical system here was hard, I'm so happy I live so far away from people who want to help me. Maybe it sounds selfish but I'm not ready to talk to my friends or family yet. My due date was the beginning of April and I'm dreading it. I feel like I can't move on until after that date has passed. Every week is a different milestone that I can't experience anymore. \n\n ", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "ttcafterloss", "subreddit_id": "t5_34scd", "subreddit_subscribers": 4239, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Lost my baby but happy to be so far from home.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/ttcafterloss/comments/a0tf0f/lost_my_baby_but_happy_to_be_so_far_from_home/"}, {"author": "yourgirlsamus", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_gq1c6", "author_patreon_flair": false, "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1543313577, "domain": "self.ttcafterloss", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/ttcafterloss/comments/a0tl2e/still_not_over_it/", "gildings": {"gid_1": 0, "gid_2": 0, "gid_3": 0}, "id": "a0tl2e", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 6, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/ttcafterloss/comments/a0tl2e/still_not_over_it/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1543313577, "score": 1, "selftext": "I lost my pregnancy at week 12 in the middle of October.

I've had RPL testing and everything came back normal. Every time I've gotten pregnant it's taken me between 4-6 cycles. That is my intro. On the venting. \n\nMy best friend (former now, maybe? I don't know) is pregnant. She started trying in April 2018 and had the nerve to text me crying in July 2018 complaining about her \"fertility issues.\" She got pregnant that same month. I've grown to be livid about her self-centeredness (which has always been present, just easier to ignore before) and lack of support. My husband doesn't understand because he thinks I'm just bitter and spiteful. When she texted me about her so-called fertility problems, I was appalled but held back my feelings in order to empathize with her and help her feel better about her situation. After she became pregnant, she texted me complaining because her doctor wouldn't give her a blood test to confirm the pregnancy (she has no history of losses) and would not listen to my explanation. She refused to hear that they would probably not let her record the first ultrasound (they didn't). She had the nerve to ask me, \"Do people really want to get pregnant that badly?\" when she found out that some people on BabyCenter join birth clubs based on estimated due date and not actual due date. When I miscarried this last time, she didn't call me until a few days later, spoke to me for 5 minutes, and while I was on a long-winded rant, interrupted to say she suddenly had to go (no reason). While I was telling her about the results of my testing, she sent me a audio recording of her baby's heartbeat. She told me that she drank alcohol the night she found out she was pregnant \"to celebrate\" and that she has smoked cigarettes and marijuana throughout her pregnancy. The last straw was when I told her that if we find out that we have genetic problems (we don't), we don't plan to adopt or do IVF and will spend our money on things we enjoy, like traveling. She responded by saying that she would be JEALOUS because she likes to travel. To top it off, this friend works in mental health and definitely knows when empathy is needed. \n\nAnyway, does anyone else feel like a bitter, angry, IDGAF attitude has just consumed them?

So far gone in fact, that it\u2019s amazing I was even able to get pregnant and stay pregnant long enough to realize I was pregnant. My Dr and I now have a plan of action to get me healthy again and I am so grateful. \n\nIt\u2019s very sad that I lost my baby, but if it weren\u2019t for the pregnancy, I never would have known I had a problem at all and I might have gone on TTC for years without ever knowing there was a hormonal imbalance stopping me. Now my partner and I know we need to first correct this issue before TTC again, less we would only MC again and again. \n\nI\u2019m 32 years old and have a major medical condition that will likely have me on medication for the rest of my life, and I had no idea! I\u2019ve never been the type to go to the Dr, never thought I needed to. This whole experience has humbled me. Our bodies are delicate and attention needs to be paid to their well-being. It breaks my heart to learn that I was the reason my baby will never join us on earth, but I am go grateful that modern medicine has revealed to me a very treatable condition, that once treated, will allow me to go on to build a happy and healthy baby in the future.
