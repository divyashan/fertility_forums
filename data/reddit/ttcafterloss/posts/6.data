Posting it makes it real; I have to face it.  I was going to post in the daily thread, but this is just too long.\n\nI'm 36, turning 37 this year.  I have been with my partner for 13years.  They have not all been easy, but there has only be one time when I have seriously considered separating; 2 years ago.  I asked him to leave.  There was a triggering event, but it culminated from a number of unsupportive acts.\n\nIt has really only been the last 18 months I have considered having a baby.  My partner has wanted one for years.  Over the last 12months I have been preparing (had thyroid issues), we started trying in January and conceived, miscarried and had a D&amp;C late March.\n\n\nAs some of you may recall, out baby's heart rate was slow on the 8 week ultrasound. I took the week off.  He seemed to resent the fact I had taken time off, I wrote him a letter (he also works shift) saying we needed to stick together and things improved.  A week later I went back to confirm it had stopped.  I had a D&amp;C the next morning.  We were both present for the first ultrasound.  He made no attempt to come to the second, stayed home an played PS4.  When he did not get up to leave the house with me I left without questioning.   He went to work later that afternoon, I got tipsy. That night  I told him about the D&amp;C the next morning, he offered to come.  I still being a bit drunk (and given he doesn't drive) said not to worry as I would have to get a cab anyway.  A girlfriend had offered to pick me up.  There was no argument, no resentment at the time on my behalf. I was still in shock from the whole thing.  The next morning I kissed him goodbye (he was in bed, I had to leave early).  He asked me to call when it was over.\n\nI have never felt more vulnerable and alone than on the day of the D&amp;C. I was pretty composed pre/post op, but pre op did have silent tears down my face in front of the OB, who was very supportive.  He seemed concerned I was alone, but didn't say anything. \n I took another week off to emotionally heal. There were a number of triggers, especially on the first shift back (see previous posts).  I tried bringing them up with my partner; he really couldn't appreciate, didn't seem to understand why I was upset.  His silence shut me down, he seemed angry with me that I was upset. I stopped talking to him about it.  I briefly transferred my feelings to the person who had been there and shown me support, my OB. I was aware of what I was doing and know it is just a coping mechanism.  After all, I have only met this person a few times.\n\nI have lost a number of close people in the past (due to deaths) and I began to imagine my life without him, if he were dead and I pregnant (or not).  It is a habit of mine to in my head kill off those close to me when I am scared of loss.\n\nLast week I saw a good friend who was 6 weeks ahead of where I had been, I did well at the time.  I internally fell apart afterwards.  I cut myself that night, small cuts, in a hidden place, deliberately spaced and of the depth that I could blame it on out skittish cat should anyone see. I have not done this for 18-19 years. He is completely unaware of what I have been going through.\n\nI took a week off this sub to try and switch my focus.  I have been on a rollercoaster the last week.  The highs mostly from increasing signs of ovulation and the chance of another pregnancy. He wants to try again, I want a baby.  \n\nBut  I am scared while I love him I am not in love with him. I am concerned he will never be the person I need. He should have come to the second ultrasound without me asking.  He should have come to the hospital with me, one it's ok I have a taxi should have been seen for me being in shock.  Surely this man knows me after all this time?\n\nWe have an apartment by the beach which I love and have put my heart into making a home.  I work shift work and earn a lot more than my partner. I think I could handle the mortgage alone when I removed the income insurance and health insurance I pay for him.\n\n\nI am torn between baby making  (the time is now and we have been having unprotected sex) and trying to, as amicably as possible end this relationship - knowing I will likely never have a baby if this occurs.\n\n\nThank you for indulging me by reading.  This is the only place I feel I can have a voice that will be listened to.\n\n", "stickied": false, "subreddit": "ttcafterloss", "subreddit_id": "t5_34scd", "thumbnail": "default", "title": "Conflicted", "url": "http://www.reddit.com/r/ttcafterloss/comments/357fb8/conflicted/"}, {"author": "jwad1246", "author_created_utc": 1417800037, "author_flair_css_class": "", "author_flair_text": "BFP 7/11 after 1 CP, cycle 10, please baby stay ", "author_fullname": "t2_jtob5", "created_utc": 1431030422, "domain": "self.ttcafterloss", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/ttcafterloss/comments/357r70/can_anyone_help_me_determine_my_cd_blood_results/", "gilded": 0, "id": "357r70", "is_self": true, "link_flair_css_class": "question", "link_flair_text": "Question", "media_embed": {}, "num_comments": 17, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/ttcafterloss/comments/357r70/can_anyone_help_me_determine_my_cd_blood_results/", "retrieved_on": 1440748953, "score": 4, "secure_media_embed": {}, "selftext": "So as I'm switching docs and insurance I'm really just looking at my first blood test myself, the CD3 test.

I've been a bit more MIA lately. I've been trying to keep off the internet as much as I can as I just needed a break. I was doing a bit better and found the harder I was working in the garden the less I was thinking about my due date which is now less than a week away. Overall I would call it a pretty great coping strategy and I've been getting quite a bit of traction out of it. \n\nAnyway, today I was right in the middle of something I had to finish when the sky opened up and started pouring on me. I decided to tough it out in the rain and wrap up what I was doing. So there I am, muddy, sweaty, drenched in rain and out come my neighbors running to the car on the way to deliver their baby. All of the progress I thought I had made just collapsed around me. I went in and just sobbed harder than I have in months. I love gardening, it is what all my friends know me for, but this was the year I wasn't supposed to be gardening. This is the year we had all joked about how my best friend was going to throw some silk flowers in our yard. I shouldn't have been covered in rain and muck. I should have been carrying that hospital bag. I should have been the one having a baby. It just hurts so bad and I'm so afraid this hurt is never going to go away. I feel like it is going to be just lurking around the corner for the rest of my life and it isn't fair. \n\nAnyway, I just needed to tell someone and I knew you guys would understand. I'm sitting here on CD2 wondering where we go next. Last cycle I was too depressed and had some other health issues going on so I didn't bother to even do the OPK. I guess we'll try again this month but it all feels so helpless and hopeless. I'm just so tired. I just wanted to be a mom, ya know?

I saw my little baby and the heartbeat pumping away, it was really happening I was pregnant. I was only 6 weeks so I had to wait until 10 weeks for my next appointment. This time the ultrasound showed no heartbeat and no baby. The baby appeared to have died shortly after the first ultrasound.  I opted to take misoprostol instead of having a d&amp;c. It was a horrible experience and I will never do it again. My doctor told me to wait at least 3 months before trying again. In March I was hospitalized for three days for a pulmonary embolism. The blood clot in my lung may have been caused by the miscarriage or my miscarriage may have occurred because of blood clots. I found out I am genetically at increased risk for blood clots. So now I am on blood thinners and have to give my body 6 months to heal. I will have to switch blood thinners to shots that I will give myself everyday while I am trying to conceive and throughout any pregnancy. So here I am waiting to try again in November while it seems everyone around me is expecting. So that's my story. It feels so good to write it all out.

Two days later I began spotting, followed by heavy bleeding. I went to the hospital where my HCG level was 4. My miscarriage at 5 weeks was confirmed as they found tissue coming out during a pelvic exam.\n\nI'm so so sad. This was the last thing I expected after a relatively normal first pregnancy. I know it was so early, but we had already chosen names, told some family and gotten so excited. And I know I'm lucky I have my son. But it doesn't make my heart hurt any less.

To all my amazing mother friends, happy Mother's Day and I hope you take a moment to appreciate the miraculous series of events that brought your kiddos into your arms. \ud83d\ude18\"", "stickied": false, "subreddit": "ttcafterloss", "subreddit_id": "t5_34scd", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "My Mother's Day \"coming out\"", "url": "http://www.reddit.com/r/ttcafterloss/comments/35hz3y/my_mothers_day_coming_out/"}, {"author": "rainbowmoonheartache", "author_created_utc": 1391964096, "author_flair_css_class": "", "author_flair_text": "TTC#2; RPL; IVF#3/FET#1!", "author_fullname": "t2_f6zfo", "created_utc": 1431275076, "domain": "self.ttcafterloss", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/ttcafterloss/comments/35i3qb/thank_you_motha_fucking_nature_3/", "gilded": 0, "id": "35i3qb", "is_self": true, "link_flair_css_class": "support", "link_flair_text": "Support &amp; encouragement", "media_embed": {}, "num_comments": 6, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/ttcafterloss/comments/35i3qb/thank_you_motha_fucking_nature_3/", "post_hint": "self", "preview": {"images": [{"id": "mObYT5E_vGlaS4c9PKVnzZum1awNGHqeIFfodo6oXS8", "resolutions": [{"height": 191, "url": "https://i.redditmedia.com/9O_ov4chkK-LtctIKIX2-xuzKAeDJG72bKW5zn3iRaA.jpg?fit=crop&amp;crop=faces%2Centropy&amp;arh=2&amp;w=108&amp;s=7d66e6fd88377d758b6f74186022890c", "width": 108}, {"height": 383, "url": "https://i.redditmedia.com/9O_ov4chkK-LtctIKIX2-xuzKAeDJG72bKW5zn3iRaA.jpg?fit=crop&amp;crop=faces%2Centropy&amp;arh=2&amp;w=216&amp;s=38f19b096494ee3c7753d70b5f899df1", "width": 216}, {"height": 568, "url": "https://i.redditmedia.com/9O_ov4chkK-LtctIKIX2-xuzKAeDJG72bKW5zn3iRaA.jpg?fit=crop&amp;crop=faces%2Centropy&amp;arh=2&amp;w=320&amp;s=a19661e60a3f5ae4b4d5da1b9f489c63", "width": 320}, {"height": 1136, "url": "https://i.redditmedia.com/9O_ov4chkK-LtctIKIX2-xuzKAeDJG72bKW5zn3iRaA.jpg?fit=crop&amp;crop=faces%2Centropy&amp;arh=2&amp;w=640&amp;s=102d6efdec5055867847e474a8e679ea", "width": 640}, {"height": 1705, "url": "https://i.redditmedia.com/9O_ov4chkK-LtctIKIX2-xuzKAeDJG72bKW5zn3iRaA.jpg?fit=crop&amp;crop=faces%2Centropy&amp;arh=2&amp;w=960&amp;s=dafd27183d83d783754863df946d9fe1", "width": 960}, {"height": 1918, "url": "https://i.redditmedia.com/9O_ov4chkK-LtctIKIX2-xuzKAeDJG72bKW5zn3iRaA.jpg?fit=crop&amp;crop=faces%2Centropy&amp;arh=2&amp;w=1080&amp;s=c2d7c78e1f85316fcd4ec287c068d8b1", "width": 1080}], "source": {"height": 4320, "url": "https://i.redditmedia.com/9O_ov4chkK-LtctIKIX2-xuzKAeDJG72bKW5zn3iRaA.jpg?s=9e287d8072b7b62159e40e85230a0bae", "width": 2432}, "variants": {}}]}, "retrieved_on": 1440744065, "score": 16, "secure_media_embed": {}, "selftext": "http://imgur.com/ePtW2LU\n\n(didn't realize until after I took the photo that I had it on upside-down, haha.

My husband and I have a long road ahead of us, but we talked a lot about everything and we still want to try again. We'll get our baby dammit! If we had not known what the cause was we both agreed that we might not want to try right away. I got the go ahead that provided my levels go down like they should and my next period is normal we can start trying. I'm not excited about starting over again, but I'm hopeful that next time will be better.

My husband and I were ecstatic, our families were elated, everything was great. \n\nAt my first ultrasound, they noticed a few abnormalities with the umbilical cord or so they thought, at 8 weeks it was too early to really tell. They told me to come back 2 weeks later to check on everything. Other than this the heartbeat was strong and I told myself it wasn't worth worrying about until I found out more.\n\n2 weeks later I am getting my ultrasound and I am informed that there is no cardiac activity in the fetus. Thinking it was something (possibly a cyst) with the umbilical cord I was completely blindsided. I have never been so devastated in my life.\n\nAfter discussing my options with my doctor, I opted for a D&amp;C because I just couldn't wait for this whole experience to be over with. He also told me that now they believed that the cyst was in the baby's chest.\n\nAfter waiting and waiting I have finally got my period and my first cycle has officially started. My doctor recommended waiting 3 months but then said that people get pregnant earlier than that after a miscarriage and they have perfectly healthy pregnancies. Am I crazy for trying before the 3 months are up? Maybe...\n\nIt has been a long hard struggle for me but I am glad to have found a place with others that understand what I am going through. :)", "stickied": false, "subreddit": "ttcafterloss", "subreddit_id": "t5_34scd", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "I figured I should introduce myself.", "url": "http://www.reddit.com/r/ttcafterloss/comments/35nllz/i_figured_i_should_introduce_myself/"}, {"author": "shishi_1", "author_created_utc": 1414945871, "author_flair_css_class": "", "author_flair_text": "TTC#1 - MC11/14", "author_fullname": "t2_j5yhy", "created_utc": 1431393757, "domain": "self.ttcafterloss", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/ttcafterloss/comments/35nxbl/thank_you_ucittykat13/", "gilded": 0, "id": "35nxbl", "is_self": true, "link_flair_css_class": "support", "link_flair_text": "Support &amp; encouragement", "media_embed": {}, "num_comments": 3, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/ttcafterloss/comments/35nxbl/thank_you_ucittykat13/", "post_hint": "self", "preview": {"images": [{"id": "rfMGM4kxmt900ejEzFbPzf_X6ulYpblcFqyHetZMe5k", "resolutions": [{"height": 144, "url": "https://i.redditmedia.com/J_KUvqAbKUmmQbombYr5k4IVYeubTJUS6fIqwJzAlos.jpg?fit=crop&amp;crop=faces%2Centropy&amp;arh=2&amp;w=108&amp;s=f4b11b9ac879f0284e91fd0bcd5cdd67", "width": 108}, {"height": 288, "url": "https://i.redditmedia.com/J_KUvqAbKUmmQbombYr5k4IVYeubTJUS6fIqwJzAlos.jpg?fit=crop&amp;crop=faces%2Centropy&amp;arh=2&amp;w=216&amp;s=a53f66cf3c22cc82fae8fcd4c8e294ae", "width": 216}, {"height": 426, "url": "https://i.redditmedia.com/J_KUvqAbKUmmQbombYr5k4IVYeubTJUS6fIqwJzAlos.jpg?fit=crop&amp;crop=faces%2Centropy&amp;arh=2&amp;w=320&amp;s=6e789cf8c865dc6f87b91ae8a72a04fa", "width": 320}, {"height": 853, "url": "https://i.redditmedia.com/J_KUvqAbKUmmQbombYr5k4IVYeubTJUS6fIqwJzAlos.jpg?fit=crop&amp;crop=faces%2Centropy&amp;arh=2&amp;w=640&amp;s=601514730ab807077769f1b5fcb98747", "width": 640}], "source": {"height": 960, "url": "https://i.redditmedia.com/J_KUvqAbKUmmQbombYr5k4IVYeubTJUS6fIqwJzAlos.jpg?s=1a2531f26041ef9b1dbce1d46cc856c1", "width": 720}, "variants": {}}]}, "retrieved_on": 1440741289, "score": 9, "secure_media_embed": {}, "selftext": "Thank you so much for sending this beautiful card and I loved your hand written note.It definitely made me cry.

My husband and I got married in August 2013, and wanted to ttc immediately. I had been on the bcp for 12 years, and stopped taking the pill in September of that year. We unknowingly conceived in October. In November, my husband was out of province taking a course. I \"conveniently\" hadn't been feeling well the whole week, and just figured I must have picked up a bug of some sort. I had been lightly bleeding for 2 weeks, so didn't think I was pregnant (I figured it was just a screwy period since it started right when I was expecting AF if I wasn't pregnant, and since I just came off of bcp I was expecting weird bleeding to happen because of past issues. So I wasn't overly shocked at bleeding for 2 weeks). I felt increasingly worse over the course of the week, so finally called my doctor and scheduled an appointment for the next Monday. I didn't make it that long. On the Saturday night, I woke up from a nausea med induced nap on the couch with a massive cramp. I sat in agony and waited for it to pass, then got up and went to the bathroom, expecting a hemorrhage or something. I sat down on the toilet, and next thing I know I was waking up on the bathroom floor with my face pressed into the bathtub. I called my husband panicking and balling my eyes out to tell him what had just happened. He immediately called his sister who lived nearby and she picked me up and took me to the hospital. I found out at the hospital I was pregnant, but the doctor had an extremely concerned and confused look on his face. He told me I needed to come back Sunday morning for an emergency ultrasound (It was past midnight and I wasn't at the maternity hospital so they couldn't do it at that time) then go back to the ER to wait for the results. The doctor was worried it was an ectopic pregnancy that had possibly ruptured. Following morning I get the call to come in for the ultrasound. I had never had one before since this was my first pregnancy, so didn't really know what to expect. The technician wouldn't show me anything, and she took a ton of time doing the ultrasound. After she finished I went back to the ER and waited a couple of hours for the results. Finally got called in, and a doctor came rushing in, briefly explained something about my uterus looking like it was full of blood and I needed a D&amp;C but would have to go to the other hospital. She said I couldn't drive myself, so I needed to go by ambulance, then rushed out. A nurse came in and stuck an IV in my arm, then I had more blood tests, then was rushed off into a waiting ambulance and transported to the other hospital and admitted. I met the gynaecologist when I got there, and she informed me I had a molar pregnancy. I had no idea what this was. And that my HCG level at the time was close to 600,000, and my uterus was measuring at about 16 weeks. We estimated that I was only about 5 weeks pregnant. At this point my husband had rushed back and was able to be with me. I was scheduled for an emergency D&amp;C and finally had it Monday night, performed by a gynaecological oncologist. I ended up spending 5 days in the hospital because I lost over 2L of blood and tissue during the procedure and almost needed a blood transfusion. I also passed out after a trip to the bathroom. So I wasn't allowed to leave my bed alone for the rest of the time. The gyn onc told me that I may require chemo later on if the molar pregnancy didn't totally resolve after the surgery, because she wasn't able to surgically remove it all due to my uterus being way too soft. She wouldn't do any more D&amp;C's on me, my only other option would have been a hysterectomy. I bled heavily after my surgery for 3.5 weeks, and suffered 3 hemorrhages during that time. Once the bleeding stopped, my HCG immediately started going up again, which meant I needed chemo. I ended up needing a strong course of 5 chemo drugs, EMA/CO, every week over a course of 5 months in order to get my HCG back to zero, and lost all of my hair. I finished chemo at the end of April 2014. Due to the crazy chemo and risk of relapse, we were required to wait a year post chemo to ttc. \n\nIn January 2015, we \"accidentally\" got pregnant. I had taken the morning after pill because we were afraid of birth defects, etc from conceiving too soon after finishing chemo. Well the morning after pill didn't work, and the pregnancy tried to stick around. Because of my molar pregnancy we were monitoring my HCG levels monthly with a blood test. So when my period didn't come in February, I went for my monthly blood test, and my HCG came back as 18. The following week it was 19, then I started bleeding, so assumed I was miscarrying, especially since the HCG levels did not indicate a viable pregnancy. My doctors, however, were concerned it was a relapse of my molar pregnancy. After I stopped bleeding, my HCG level continued to rise. I was sent for 3 ultrasounds that couldn't find anything, and a CT scan that couldn't see anything. I ended up having a laparoscopy and D&amp;C in March after my HCG levels reached 2600. It turned out to be a miscarriage with retained product that kept growing, but because of my \"pre existing condition\", my doctors freaked out and assumed the worst. To be honest, I'm glad they did and I wasn't just ignored, but it was a ridiculous emotional roller coaster. \n\nThe last 1.5 years have been unbelievable, but they are finally over. We were cleared to finally start ttc last month. Unfortunately my husband works out of province now for 32 days straight and is only home for 10 days at a time, so we don't have too many chances to get pregnant. We're praying it all works out at the end of this month when he is home and we get pregnant.\n\nThanks for reading. If anyone wants to share their story with me, or needs to talk if they are going through something similar and just needs to talk about it, I'm all ears/eyes. The best therapy for me getting over all of this has been talking about it, and helping others experiencing something similar. Especially molar pregnancy since it is so widely unknown and even doctors and nurses don't know about it. \n\nHugs to everyone! &lt;3\n\nTL;DR: I had a complete molar pregnancy requiring a D&amp;C and 5 months of heavy duty chemo, followed by an abnormal miscarriage that resulted in a laparoscopy and D&amp;C. 1.5 years later, finally cleared to start ttc.", "stickied": false, "subreddit": "ttcafterloss", "subreddit_id": "t5_34scd", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Guess I'll stop lurking, and introduce myself.

I did silly depressing things like cuddle the small square of the baby blanket that I had started knitting, but will never finish and re-fold the two TMNT onesies that my husband had bought. I also spent a lot of time researching fertility tracking and making a plan for us to try again, because I'm ready now.\n\nI woke up this morning and everything is different.

When I found out this ts broke my heart and I saw my childhood book a whole new way.\n\nMy mom read this to me all the time when I was little and plan on doing the same to mine. It's close to my heart. I suggest reading the original first to fully understand my version. I don't know, it sounds kind of cheesy but it's still hard to read for me..\n\nA mother held her new embryo and very slowly felt her stomach, back and forth, back and forth, back and forth. And while she held it, she sang:\nI'll love you forever,\nI'll like you for always,\nAs long as I'm living\nmy baby you'll soon be.\n\nThe baby grew. He grew and he grew and he grew. He grew until he was 7 weeks old, and she dreamed he ran all around the house. He would pull all the books off the shelves. He would pull all the food out of the refrigerator and he would take his mother's watch and flush it down the toilet. Sometimes his mother would be excited to be able to say, \"this kid is driving me CRAZY!\"\n\nBut at night time, when that 7 week old had taken all her energy, she came home to her room, crawled across the floor, got into bed to see if her husband was asleep; she got in, felt her stomach back and forth, back and forth, back and forth. While she held it she sang:\n\nI'll love you forever,\nI'll like you for always,\nAs long as I'm living\nmy baby you'll soon be.\n\nThen, the exciting day arrived. She stepped into the white room, layed into the bed, and saw her little baby bean on the screen. But the bean hadn't grown. He didn't move, his heart didn't beat. She was told he would never grow to be 1 year old, or 5, or 10. And he would never come in late for dinner, he would never have a bath, and grandma would never visit to see him. She would not ever want to sell him to the zoo.\n\nSo at night time, while her husband was asleep, the mother quietly opened the door to the room, crawl across the floor and get into the bed. If her husband was really asleep, she rubbed her stomach, back and forth, back and forth, back and forth. And while she rubbed it she still sang:\n\nI'll love you forever,\nI'll like you for always,\nAs long as I'm living\nmy baby you'll be.\n\n\n", "stickied": false, "subreddit": "ttcafterloss", "subreddit_id": "t5_34scd", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Been contemplating posting this but here it is - I'll love you forever (my version)", "url": "http://www.reddit.com/r/ttcafterloss/comments/364trq/been_contemplating_posting_this_but_here_it_is/"}, {"author": "AutoModerator", "author_created_utc": 1325741068, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_text": null, "author_fullname": "t2_6l4z3", "created_utc": 1431759734, "distinguished": "moderator", "domain": "self.ttcafterloss", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/ttcafterloss/comments/3658vn/ttcafterloss_ttc_daily_discussion_thread_may_16/", "gilded": 0, "id": "3658vn", "is_self": true, "link_flair_css_class": "ttc", "link_flair_text": "TTC Thread", "media_embed": {}, "num_comments": 68, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/ttcafterloss/comments/3658vn/ttcafterloss_ttc_daily_discussion_thread_may_16/", "retrieved_on": 1440733087, "score": 10, "secure_media_embed": {}, "selftext": "**This thread is for members who are TTC or waiting to try.

She is now 1 and we are trying for another. We literally tried once and bingo I was pregnant!!!! I have been so excited ever since I found out. I started to search for possible names, imagined what he or she will be like and was just extremely happy. Until yesterday. I started cramping early in the day and it just got worse from there. When I went to the bathroom I noticed drops of blood. At that point I thought it was just the normal implantation bleeding that typically happens in the early weeks. I was wrong. The bleeding didn't stop and is still is going on. My husband really tried to make me feel better he's not the best with emotions. He reassured me that we will try again and it will all work out. He also said that this is nature's way of saying that there was something wrong with the pregnancy. I believe him and I do feel a little better, but I can't make the feeling of loss go away. This morning I am sitting at my desk at work and I feel such a range of emotions. I want to cry, scream and just crawl up in a ball. I never thought this would happen to me. I haven't told anyone besides my husband. I want to tell my mom, sister, friends, but I'm not sure I'm ready for all of the questions just yet.", "stickied": false, "subreddit": "ttcafterloss", "subreddit_id": "t5_34scd", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "I lost my baby :(", "url": "http://www.reddit.com/r/ttcafterloss/comments/36mx0e/i_lost_my_baby/"}, {"author": "seraphin22", "author_created_utc": 1398133334, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_text": null, "author_fullname": "t2_g8r9p", "created_utc": 1432156710, "domain": "self.ttcafterloss", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/ttcafterloss/comments/36od5x/taking_a_month_off_has_been_so_good_for_my_heart/", "gilded": 0, "id": "36od5x", "is_self": true, "link_flair_css_class": "update", "link_flair_text": "Update", "media_embed": {}, "num_comments": 10, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/ttcafterloss/comments/36od5x/taking_a_month_off_has_been_so_good_for_my_heart/", "retrieved_on": 1440723986, "score": 25, "secure_media_embed": {}, "selftext": "We have taken this month off of TTC, as I was not handling the tracking and testing and symptom spotting well. \n\nI was supposed to be on an antibiotic all month as well which is why we weren't supposed to be trying, but my Dermatologist changed my prescription to a topical cream that is safe if pregnant. We went ahead and had had unprotected sex twice this month so far, but I am not tracking or symptom spotting or testing. I don't even have the idea of pregnancy in my mind when we have sex, which is refreshing.\n\nBeing in a \"not tracking anything\" mindset has been so helpful. I feel lighter. Less crying and anxiety. My mental health has definitely improved. \n\nBefore, I was anxiously obsessed about getting pregnant and wavering from day to day about whether I was ready. I was having nightmares every night about pregnancy things and flashbacks. \n\nNow that I have had this time off, I now feel different, in a good way. I can see things a bit more clearly and am now 100% certain that I am ready and okay to be pregnant again, and that I am actually happy about the concept of a new child, instead of doing it in desperate grief to get back all the things I've lost. \n\nNot advice or anything, just wanted to share how I am feeling. I have all this energy now and am excited to track my cycles again next month. I needed this break so bad. \n\nAnyone else go through a time - off period that was similarly helpful?", "stickied": false, "subreddit": "ttcafterloss", "subreddit_id": "t5_34scd", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Taking a month off has been so good for my heart, mind, and body.", "url": "http://www.reddit.com/r/ttcafterloss/comments/36od5x/taking_a_month_off_has_been_so_good_for_my_heart/"}, {"author": "shitjoesays", "author_created_utc": 1422478588, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_text": null, "author_fullname": "t2_l0763", "created_utc": 1432159796, "domain": "self.ttcafterloss", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/ttcafterloss/comments/36okop/hello_everyone/", "gilded": 0, "id": "36okop", "is_self": true, "link_flair_css_class": "intro", "link_flair_text": "Intro", "media_embed": {}, "num_comments": 24, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/ttcafterloss/comments/36okop/hello_everyone/", "retrieved_on": 1440723889, "score": 15, "secure_media_embed": {}, "selftext": "New to this subreddit,  so if this isn't in the right place, please let me know.\n\nMy name is Liz, DH is Joe. I'm 31, he is 29, and we've been married since October 2014, together since May 2009. I just found out today that I am in the middle of my second miscarriage. First happened February this year, and we found out I was pregnant the day before Mother's day for the second time. That little fact is making it really difficult to deal with my mc, especially the second time in less than 6 months.\n\nWe've decided to try one more time once the doctor gives me the all clear to try again. I am severely overweight, I'm actually considered obese for my height and age, so if the next one doesn't stick we'll be taking a year off from trying so I can lose that extra weight to see if it does anything to help me stay pregnant. My doctor says my cervix is amazing (her words, not mine), and we are waiting on the ultrasound images to see if there is a problem with my uterus. \n\nI have a follow up appointment next week to go over everything with my doctor, so if any of you have any suggestions about what I should be bringing up, I would really appreciate it. While I'm absolutely heartbroken that we lost another baby, I'm more angry than anything, and I'm trying to channel that anger into doing everything in my power to make sure I carry my next baby to term, so literally any information you have would be greatly appreciated.
