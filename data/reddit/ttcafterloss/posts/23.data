I know that I have friends who struggle with infertility and have had multiple losses who are just as desperate for a baby as me, and they've reached out to say that I should keep writing on Facebook and sharing how I'm doing and what is on my mind.  In real life I used to be/hope to again be a funny person who enjoyed entertaining people and I am finding writing to be an outlet that helps me and may help others I know or random people who could stumble upon my writing.  I do know that Facebook is probably not the right medium for my \"downer\" posts on sad things- you know, like babies dying, so I've decided to start a blog.  Yikes! It scares me a bit, but I know I've got stuff to put out there in the universe. I know that just as much as I struggle to see pregnancy announcements on social media, my pregnant friends probably try to scroll past my posts which they rightfully shouldn't read. I was odd when pregnant as I did read every trigger-laden post on BabyBumps and I'm grateful I did because I think it made me more prepared. I know that I was the exception and not the rule, and that most pregnant women benefit from not knowing the dark alternate universe that unfortunately became my life.  So friends, I am here today asking you for recommendations for a blog name.  I hope that isn't against the rules, and I won't bog you all down with links out to my blog once it is up and running. I read \"mom blogs\" for a good four years before I conceived and I still do check out the ones from time to time that I can stomach. I've also had to stop reading many of my favorite blogs, which is sad- but I realize that it is the blogs touching on loss that help me the most now. It is my job to put others like the ones that help me out in to the universe!  I love a funny blog name and would appreciate any suggestions you have :) Funny names based on incompetent cervix are very welcomed.  I don't plan on making it a widely shared blog and it will probably only be my friends reading it so I don't plan on taking myself too seriously.  I wrote 8 pages in my journal and I think they may be my first post!

I was 11DPO and I wasn't going to announce it my husband until the test lines were dark. Starting at 12DPO, I started having morning sickness ALL DAY. My husband works from home, so I couldn't hide it from him. I decided I was just going to tell him. I planned this surprise 6 months ago when we started trying. \n\nWe're Toms shoes fans, so I bought a pair of baby Toms last October and hid them in one of his old Toms boxes to have ready. I went out \"shopping\" while he was at work and found a pair of shoes he's been eyeing for a while. I texted him and asked him which size. I came home, took the box out of the shopping bag. He opened it and saw baby shoes and a YES+ test. The look on his face was priceless! We have a Kitty Cam on our mantle, so I captured it all on video, too. I told him the line was still faint, so not to get too excited, but I was excited to start this next phase in our lives. \n\nWell, today is CD1 at 15DPO and I lost the pregnancy at 4w + 2 days. Honestly, I mentally prepared myself for this since the light tests, so it's not *as* hard, but it still hurts. All the excitement was ripped away. It's not like I had grown an attachment to this poppy seed in the past 4 days, but just the whole attachment to finally becoming a mother and waiting for this little tiny thing to grow. Plus, Mother's Day is coming up and I just want to be a mother so bad. Even more now! \n\nI'm doing okay today. I get teary eyed every now and then, but I feel like maybe this was just my body getting used to the idea of pregnancy. Like maybe it was trying to figure out how to sort the hormones and how to implant. And maybe next time, it will be a little more familiar with the idea and be like, \"Oh, I've done this before and I've practiced so now I know how to do it right.\" I might be wrong, but that's what helps me feel better, so I'm sticking to it. \n\nThe only question I have is, how were your cycles after an early loss? (I'm sure this gets asked a lot here) My cycles were **just** starting to get normal. They have since been 30, 31, 40, 47, and this was 36. My husband is going out of town for 2 weeks when I will most likely be ovulating, so I may have to just go with him. \n\nThings I did differently this cycle, which I feel made a difference in me getting pregnant was: Not as much sex - only the 2 days before O, started taking vitamin D, Bromelain from pineapple core, and I gained about 3-4 lbs. I plan on doing the same this time around.

Since I'm not active enough here for anyone to really know my story I'll go through a quick summary. I'd also like to give a general TW as loss is mentioned throughout.\n\nDH and I started TTC back in January 2015. Or well, we started having unprotected sex with the idea that we'd like to have a child. I didn't start temping, charting, etc till August 2015. We're both fairly young (I'm 28 and he's 31) so we didn't really expect to have trouble. I got my first BFP in October 2015 and then had a MC at 6w4d. My doctor cleared me to start TTC again as soon as my hCG dropped to normal so DH and I started TTC again pretty much immediately- 3 weeks or so after the MC. I got another BFP in March that ended up being a chemical ending at 5w3d. I got another two days of positives last month only to have my period start right on time.\n\nSo now what I'm wondering is when should I start considering making an appointment with an RE? I know the diagnostic criteria for RPL is 2 *clinical* losses, which I haven't had. But is there some point in time when chemical pregnancies should be considered problematic? I guess *if* something is wrong I don't want to keep waiting and having losses if I could just find the problem and fix it. But I also don't want to take up an appointment with an RE for something that could still be totally normal and just bad luck. I've had friends with infertility who have had to wait 3+ months just to get an appointment with an RE. Granted, I live in a different state now so the wait times could be different here. But I'd feel terrible if there is absolutely nothing wrong and I took an appointment spot that a lady who really *needed* it could have had.\n\nMy insurance won't cover anything I have done at an RE unless it can be filed as something other than a fertility issue. Like, for example, if I ended up having thyroid problems that I got treatment for. And because my insurance won't cover anything I don't have to bother with a referral. I could just skip that step and go straight to the RE. Just to be clear I wouldn't be seeing an RE because of trouble *getting* pregnant. I'd be seeing an RE for trouble *staying* pregnant. I know as far as seeing an RE for trouble *getting* pregnant goes I'd have to have tried unsuccessfully for a full year after the most recent loss.

It was in February when I lost my ectopic pregnancy. It's really my fault. I promised myself I would share my story, but how? It's not something you can casually bring up in conversation, most people didn't even know I was pregnant. We were at a party a few weeks after and people kept asking when we were going to have baby number 2. A party didn't exactly seem like the place to bring up the left fallopian tube that had just been removed with that baby number 2 I had wanted so badly. So I tried to keep myself together as I said \"we'll get there\".\n\nSorry for the long rant. I'm just tired of not being able to talk about it more. It seems to perpetuate the idea that losing a baby is something you shouldn't talk about and should burden alone. It also angers and saddens me because this little baby existed, they just started growing in the wrong place and never had a chance.

I'm at 8 cycles TTC and 5th after loss. I'm tired and worn out. Like many others here, I'm living and dying by the OPKs turning, BDing at the 'perfect time' and I'm just miserable during the TWW. As soon as we began TTC I went all in, doing all the things 100%. What's more, each and every time I've gotten a positive OPK, my husband can't finish the deed - we have never gotten O-1 because of it. I've tried telling him, not telling him, you name it. It's like the desperation radiates out of me and he can sense it and feels pressure. We did it FOUR times yesterday to no avail. FOUR. What's the point in tracking all these signs if when it comes to the one fundamental basic thing we need to do, we don't? \n\nI am very much ready to give it all up and simply log AF and BD into FF (omg these acronyms). We have an RE appt next week and as I filled out the medical history form I felt like an idiot and like I had no right to go in. I'm healthy and aside from O being all over the place, I should just keep trying and wait. I know this, but I want some reassurance that everything is okay before I stop tracking. Has anyone here stopping tracking and just lived life? Giving up my semblance of control is really scary but right now I feel like it's my only option because of the anxiety and depression this whole process has caused me.

I guess I'll make my intro. My husband and I (27f 29m) ttc for 4 months before I got pregnant with our first child. My first pregnancy. After my second beta only went from 59 to 67 I prepared for miscarriage. But the 3rd and 4th betas jumped up and I allowed myself to get my hopes up. Two weeks later I come home from work and notice that I'm spotting brown. I went to the ER. I was 6+3. They did an US said they saw a heartbeat (it was my first us) and sent me home. Told me my beta was at 689 but it could be a mistake. Okay. Woke up the next morning and I'm lightly bleeding and it's red. Struggled to find a doctor who would see me on such short notice but I did. I went in and she did a pelvic exam said my cervix was closed and there wasn't that much blood. She sent me to get an US and blood work. US goes okay. Babys heart rate is low at 87bpm and its measuring at 6 weeks. I'm out on bed rest and pelvic rest. I thought okay we still have a chance. Only a few hours after that I started bleeding very heavily (worse than my periods) and passing small clots. It hurt worse than the worst period cramps I've ever had and lasted a couple hours. I went to the bathroom and passed a large clot and I knew then i had lost the baby. The bleeding slowed down a bit and my cramps almost disappeared. It blew my mind how quickly that happened. My husband and I are absolutely devastated. I got confirmation this morning from my doctor, my beta yesterday was only 600. I miscarried. I'm still bleeding and passing small clots. I really just cannot believe this. I had an ultrasound scheduled for Friday to check on baby and see if the heart rate is higher but now it's an US to see if I expelled everything on my own. \n\non to my question. How do I track my cycles? My doctor said we can try again in 2-3 cycles and she said this bleeding right now she's counting as 1. I don't know if I'll be ready to try again, but I want to make sure I'm tracking correctly just in case.

I ovulated super early the first cycle (or had a very short LP) and this last cycle ovulated on CD23. \n\n\n\nWe finally got our beautiful, very positive test 2 days ago on 14dpo (after coincidentally getting a false positive on only 8dpo) and were over the moon. Finally after 18 months we did it! I let my doctor know and she ordered bloodwork. I decided to wait until Saturday morning as we were going out of town and could do it together. \n\n\n\nAfter talking all night about what we were going to do with this kiddo and when were going to announce, etc., I woke up at 0200 with severe cramping. I got up terrified and found brown spotting. I vowed to stay home in bed all day but the blood inevitably came. We would have been 4w1d. \n\n\n\nI'm so upset that this pregnancy was never confirmed. I went to get the bloodwork this morning and the lab didn't have an order from my doctor. I decided against going to the ED since the bleeding was heavy but controlled and the pain was semi-manageable. I feel like our baby never happened outside of us. \n\n\n\nI'm angry at the doctor for failing to order the bloodwork. I'm so angry at my body for failing me. I'm bitter. I'm worried. I'm so, so heartbroken. \n\n\n\nThis next cycle we were supposed to start injectables and do an IUI. I just don't think I'm prepared for that now. The timing is precise and it would mean we would have to start all of this on Monday (in 2 days). I sent my doctor an email and asked for Femara again. I would like to wait a little while to try again but my natural cycles are about 70 days long. I want the Femara to shorten this cycle if we decide not to try. But if we do want to try, we can. \n\n\n\nMy question is, with a loss this early, do I need to wait for a regular period or would I be able to move forward on the Femara? How soon do people start trying again. What did you guys do to memorialize your baby (if anything)? I feel silly wanting that with such an early loss but I think it would be helpful. \n\n\n\nSorry for the wall of text. I can't quite get my thoughts together. Any insight would be helpful.

Pretty soon after, boobs started getting smaller and not sore but started up again the first day we had sex on 4/3. On 4/18, I assume I got my period (much lighter than a normal period but lasted about 6-8 days -- I've read that AF right after a D&amp;C can be lighter because the procedure has scraped so much out already that there's very little lining left to expel). I should add that I was getting +ves on my HPTs up until the day before my period, which was CD46 assuming that the day of my D&amp;C was CD1.\n\nI'm having an issue figuring out what's wrong with my body/hormones right now. After the D&amp;C, my breasts stopped feeling sore and tender, but since then, breasts have increased in the fullness feeling and nipples are pretty sore -- even after my AF until today (HPTs are negative). I've requested to get a blood test from my Dr to make sure my HCG has gone down and am waiting for a response. Swollen boobs and sore nipples are due to estrogen and progesterone so even if my HCG = zero, I'm guessing my hormones are just being hella annoying.\n\n**Here's my timeline (thought I would share because I've been stalking other women's experiences by googling a myriad of terms):**\n* 3/3 - Had my D&amp;C at 8 weeks (BO) \n* 3/5 - 3/6 - ~25 medium to big clots 2 days later. Pretty soon after, boobs started getting smaller and not sore.\n* 3/4 - Had sex finally (whoo hoo!). The day of, boobs started getting slightly sore/heavy.\n* 3/7 - stupid hopeful so did a HPT; of course it was positive from my D&amp;C but lied to myself for a transient shot of hopefulness.\n* 3/10 - 3/12 - spotting. Whoo! Could it be implantation?? (spoiler alert: NO.)\n* 4/17 - from spotting to today, tested a bunch and lines were getting lighter and lighter.\n* 4/18 - 4/25 (8 days) - Period. Lighter than my normal cycles, but definitely bright red blood. \n* 4/28 - Had sex\n* 1/5 - Had sex\n\n", "stickied": false, "subreddit": "ttcafterloss", "subreddit_id": "t5_34scd", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "(TW) Cycle out of whack after D&amp;C", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/ttcafterloss/comments/4hamcb/tw_cycle_out_of_whack_after_dc/"}, {"author": "katrinaeveningTTC", "author_created_utc": 1452537853, "author_flair_css_class": "", "author_flair_text": "33, TTC #1 Cycle 5 after EP", "author_fullname": "t2_tp7hq", "created_utc": 1462139331, "domain": "self.ttcafterloss", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/ttcafterloss/comments/4hbu1t/do_you_keep_track_of_how_far_along_you_would_be/", "gilded": 0, "id": "4hbu1t", "is_self": true, "link_flair_css_class": "question", "link_flair_text": "Question", "locked": false, "media_embed": {}, "num_comments": 21, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/ttcafterloss/comments/4hbu1t/do_you_keep_track_of_how_far_along_you_would_be/", "retrieved_on": 1466418363, "score": 7, "secure_media_embed": {}, "selftext": "I would be 19 weeks pregnant on Tuesday, if I hadn't had a miscarriage.

This will likely be a novel. A little bit of background:  I'm 32, DH turned 30 today, early loss after 2nd cycle TTC, TTC 8 cycles total. To the best of my knowledge, I am healthy and I've always thought I had regular cycles until I began tracking temps &amp; O. The cycle we conceived I O'd at CD35. Since then, my O dates have been anywhere between CD15 and 28 and cycle lengths have been between 24-53 days.\n\nI have been miserable, anxious and overall just hating this TTC process. I'm ready to throw my hands up and give up my very diligent tracking and valuable information gathering. I decided to make an RE appt, simply to make sure everything is in working order before I loosen the reigns. They could get us in quick - today - DH's birthday. I ran all of this by him, and he said he thinks we should do whatever makes me feel better and that it's okay if it's on his bday. He's seen me cry, night after night, month after month, and has given me permission to just do whatever I feel we need to, including getting him checked out. \n\nSo prior to the appointment, they sent us a medical history form that was like 8 pages front and back, asking about menstrual and pregnancy history, health habits, surgeries, medical history, family genetic and disease history, all of that. I wrote in that I track BBT &amp; O and left a note to see my BBT charts...\"(see attached)\" I penciled in proudly. Finally, all of this work was going to pay off! Being a model patient is very important to me, apparently. \n\nWe went in and they immediately separated us. I got height and weight and DH went into the room with the doc, who was typing away on a computer and shuffling through my charts. When I joined them, the doc did not acknowledge me, introduce himself, nothing. He did not say one word. We sat in silence for a good 3-4 minutes - MINUTES - as he looked over my CM and sex schedule over the past year. Awkward does not begin to describe it. Finally, he speaks. His first words are, \"Do you know that your last name is the same as a medical procedure? It's the procedure we do when women are born without vaginas.\" Stunned, I say, \"No, I did not know that.\" and he proceeded to go to his OTHER computer, sort through hundreds of folders and eventually pulled up a powerpoint with photos of actual vaginas and diagrams, eventually to show me a slide with my last name (spelled differently) on it. He detailed the procedure in depth. I was speechless. Then he just starts asking me questions that were the same that were on the form:  \"So you started your period at 10? Regular cycles until IUD? You have heavier periods on the IUD?\" and on and on. I was very appreciative that he looked at my charts and he got an additional piece of paper to record down all of my O dates and cycle lengths from my charts. And he asked about the miscarriage and my HCG levels, which were like 7 since I went to the doc after the miscarriage was ending. He said \"Well, your ovulation and cycle lengths are pretty variable\" and seemed to indicate that that's something...bad or not so bad, I don't know...just something of note. He and my husband talked about military service for a while, which made me feel at ease, until he said that given his job in the military, he was concerned about exposure to lead and that is something to definitely check out. He noted that I had an abnormal pap in 2007 and a LEEP procedure, which seemed like a possible issue. He said that its been known to mess with CM. I told him I used to have EWCM, but not so much anymore. \n\nThen after going over more family health history and hearing his OWN ancestry story in great detail (his family founded the state of Rhode Island, apparently), he said \"lets go look at your ovaries. Do you want to see her ovaries?\" he says to my husband. The transvaginal US was quick, he could tell I ovulated a few days ago (correct!) and he found 2 ovaries. I was happy he found my left ovary because my gyno could not find it to save her life when I had the miscarriage, which I thought was weird. We went back into the room and he started drawing a flow chart of options for us. He wrote \"Couple:  OK\" because we'd gotten pregnant before. Then \"Male: Proven fertility; untested\" and \"Female:  Ovulation, variable timing\" Then he drew a damn diagram of hormones, GNRH, FSH, LH and all that stuff, as well as how the luteal phase and follicular phase work. I wanted to say \"DUDE...did you NOT see my fucking charts? Did you not hear me say I do medical research on women's health? Do you not think I know what the fucking luteal phase is?\" But anyway - after his wonderful art session, he said that we need to find out why my ovulation is all over the place - the fact that the phases of my cycle are variable could point to a hormonal problem. But then he said that he didn't see evidence of PCOS on my ovaries or other signs/symptoms so he does not think thats the problem. Then he wrote \"Cervix: LEEP, proven\" whatever that means and then said the stuff about LEEP procedures messing with CM. He wrote \"Uterus: normal on U/S\", \"Tubes:  ??\" and he also wrote that he thinks my ovarian reserve is likely good because he saw lots of little follicles at varying sizes on my ovaries. This made me so happy. My husband looked at me and gave a sigh of relief there, for some reason. It was cute. After his assessment of our situation, he drew another diagram with options. It started with TSH, PRL (what is that?) and progesterone since I O'd. Then he said we should do an SA and if its normal, then HSG or ovulation induction (clomid) might be options, all the way down to laparoscopy (if HSG is abnormal) or ovulation induction/IUI if HSG is normal. If SA is abnormal, then we're looking either at ovulation induction + IUI if it's a LITTLE abnormal, and IVF if it's a LOT abnormal. \n\nTHEN - after all this, the man decides to actually ask us, \"So, what were you guys thinking?\" I told him what I wrote above - I'm sick of tracking and want to make sure everything checks out. He then says \"okay, follow me\" without more instruction than that. They separate us, and two nurses lead me to a room to take my blood. I worried about where they were taking my husband, because I knew an SA was NOT going to happen today, nor should it. It's his fucking birthday and I did not warn him that would be happening because I never expected it to. I told the nurses, \"I feel bad, it's his birthday and I brought him here\" and they said \"Oh please! You had to have an exam and blood work...his job is MUCH easier! He should be thrilled!\" And I was pissed. Really? Would you like to go be put in a room to masturbate on your birthday, without prior knowledge you were going to be asked to do that? I hate how we just assume men are always ready to go. My husband was NOT ready to go. Little did I know the doctor lead him to a room and a male nurse was waiting for him there, and said, \"Okay, here is your cup\" and my husband says \"What is going on? I am not prepared to do this today\" and the nurse guy says, with a scoff, \"What's there to prepare for?\" and then, \"Your wife had an exam didn't she? You need to do your part\" and my husband says \"I want to talk to my wife\" and they told him to go wait in the waiting room. I came out and he was so upset. He asked if we could talk outside and he said he didn't want to ruin this for me, but that the appointment was not what he thought it was going to be and that he was not prepared to jack off into a cup. He said as long as I wasn't mad and if I was okay, he was okay, but that he was pissed and needed a minute. I felt fucking horrible. I have to give him 2 weeks notice if I want to go to fucking dinner somewhere - there was no way on earth he was going to be okay with a spontaneous jack off into a cup. I told him I was not mad, that I was sorry, and that I'd go talk to him. I went back inside and asked for a cup and said we'd do it at home and bring it in. They didn't even say goodbye to me, give me guidance about following up after the results, nothing. We were so, so pissed. The beginning and end of the visit were very bad, but the middle was okay, I guess? \n\nI am just speechless. This was an INFERTILITY CLINIC. People come into this place daily in their most desperate, vulnerable states. They provided ZERO guidance about what the visit was going to consist of, what was happening when we were separated (twice) and just expected my husband to be comfortable jacking off with no warning into a cup? I realize that maybe we should have expected it to be an option...and I did expect it...AS AN OPTION. Perhaps a conversation like, \"Well, a semen analysis would be good. We can do it today, you can bring in a sample on your own, or make an appointment at a later date to come back in and we will collect it then, which option of these do you prefer?\" VERSUS \"ok, follow me...jack off now\" What the fuck. Maybe many men would be okay with this, but my husband is not one of them. Given his PTSD, he is not okay with surprises like that, and doctors and the medical system stress him out a whole lot anyway. There was no recognition that maybe it wasn't a good time? On the damn SA form it says you can't have had sex before 2 or after 5 days prior to sample collection...they didn't even ask! I expected more sensitivity and tact given the nature of what these people do, but I guess when you see it and treat it day in and day out, all of us people blur together and we are no longer looked at individuals with our own experiences and needs. We are cattle. Thanks for reading if you made it this far - I really needed to get that all out! I'm going to pamper my husband today and wait a few days before I present him with the jizz cup. Will update on my hormone levels once I get them.

It was very early - 6 weeks by dates but the pregnancy was only as developed as a 4 week one. The experience was exactly like a heavy period.\n\nI know that it's normal for hormones to be all over the place after miscarrying, but I guess I'm a little bit unsure as to what that actually means and what to expect or how long it might go on for. Most resources I've found seem aimed at women who miscarried later, with no indication as to whether it's different.\n\nI am finding that my moods are all over - I have been low energy/low mood like walking through quicksand, then irritable like PMT, (and during these two I'd start off wanting sex but get absolutely nothing from it) then super horny, then generally feeling extremely loving towards everyone. I also had really disturbing dreams a few days after stopping bleeding. Now I'm getting weird dreams again, not disturbing or vivid, just weird. (When I was pregnant, I had vivid dreams but not disturbing or overly weird.)\n\nI'm also getting a lot of thin clear discharge. I have had fairly constant constipation (I don't know how much this is caused by when I was scared to push :/). Pelvic floor pain too, and the weirdest one, that I can only describe as my uterus feeling loose. You know how your boobs hurt if you run up stairs because they bounce? It feels like that. That makes sex frustrating, because it feels great at first but then it starts to feel alarming. Is that a normal thing?\n\nI guess.. any timescales on how long it's likely to last? I only bled for about four days. I think perhaps I was hoping that it would have just manifested like a normal period and I'd get back to my normal cycle quickly. I feel like if we weren't TTC, I probably wouldn't have known I was pregnant... well except for being 10+ days late and the gigantaboobs. (Yeah okay, who am I kidding, I definitely would have tested.)\n\nAlso, is there any way to tell when you're ovulating again afterwards? My doctor said to wait for a period, but I read online that this isn't for any medical reason, it it just to make a pregnancy easier to date. It was only our first month TTC, so I hadn't been temping or tracking ovulation or anything. Is it worth starting to temp now to see if I can see a pattern? I know the theory of it because I looked at it years ago as a form of contraception. They want to give me a blood test in a week to check my HCG is down to 0. But I am contemplating just taking a home pregnancy test and cancelling that appointment.

I don\u2019t know what coping \u201cwell\u201d looks like, but I feel like I\u2019m in a downward spiral. \n\nI\u2019m trying to stay busy and keep my mind on other things, but I\u2019ve found myself putting 100% effort into the fa\u00e7ade of normalcy but frankly, I\u2019m exhausted. I have a somewhat stressful academic position &amp; am the president of a large organization that requires a lot of time and effort. I\u2019m currently trying to go about all of my normal routines like nothing ever happened (I think I prefer this over everybody knowing and being weird/uncomfortable), but I\u2019ve found myself sometimes crying all day at work, with random triggers everywhere I turn. I thought about taking some time off, but honestly I think sitting at home would be worse than stressful job/responsibilities.\n\nMother\u2019s Day stuff has hit me a LOT harder than I anticipated. Had blood drawn the other day for HCG count (finally down to zero, at least) and the nurse nonchalantly asked me if I\u2019m \u201cready for Mother\u2019s Day\u201d\u2026. didn\u2019t think I would still be crying about it days later. My head conditions are terrible, on my worst days I think about hurting myself. I walk by the bookshelf with the sonogram (flipped over) and wonder whether to keep/cherish it or burn it. I can\u2019t even bear to pick it up. I have flashbacks/nightmares where I\u2019m reliving the experience of digging the fetus out of the bloody toilet with salad tongs to put into a sample container so it can be examined. Just walking into my obgyn\u2019s office is a trigger, sitting there beside pregnant women gazing lovingly at their latest sonogram (Look, it\u2019s a boy!).\n\nI tried antidepressants but the side effects just made things worse. I'm very sensitive to most meds so I don't like to take anything. I\u2019ve got an appointment with a therapist for 5 weeks from now (ugh, healthcare) but I\u2019m a very private person and am dreading having to open up to a complete stranger about something so personal (irony noted, internet strangers don't count).\n\nMy support system is very limited, as my family lives across the country (the close fam knows about it, as we had just announced to them a few days before the loss), but I\u2019m not particularly close with any of them. Only a few friends know about it here. My best friend (also across the country) gets it and is the best support, but I feel like I\u2019m dragging her down with me\u2026  I\u2019m tired of being a broken record of depression. DH doesn\u2019t get it at all. I\u2019ve tried to open up to him but he just gets upset when my answer to \u201cwhat\u2019s wrong now?\u201d is me getting upset and saying \u201ceverything\u201d. He\u2019s promised to try to deal with me in a better way, but it\u2019s so frustrating.

This first week and a half or so I was the biggest mess, I didn't eat or sleep and was crying nearly every hour. \n\nI suffer from anxiety and depression so I know that was a big part of it. But I was also taking it out big time on my boyfriend, which wasn't fair at all to him. I would get mad at him at the smallest things and could see how he was walking on eggshells around me. He was still really loving and supporting though. \n\nI was feeling suicidal as well and was hurting myself, he was going to take me to the hospital but I decided against it. I also just one night thought, \"dwelling over something that I have no control over and can't change isn't going to help me mentally.\" So I told him I no longer want to talk about Skylar to him or anyone else and not to bring it up. \n\nI bought a little Winnie the Pooh teddy that was the same as I put in Skylar's little box we buried him in to sleep with. But put away all the ultrasounds, HPT, and scrapbook. I was fine for a few days then starting having extremely bad night terrors about it. \n\nLast night was the worst thus far. I was dreaming of Skylar and my bf, Skylar and I were laying on a bed. I don't remember the whole thing but somewhere in my dream things started getting really negative and my boyfriend was in a mocking way asking Skylar, \"is your body cold outside buried in the ground?\" and some other things. My boyfriend then started laughing that I was crying and told me he didn't love me and was going to leave me and take Skylar. I was crying on the ground after that. \n\nAt this point my boyfriend came and woke me up because he said I sounded really distressed and as soon as he woke me up, I started crying uncontrollably.

Sharing my (long) story after lurking for a few weeks. Hoping to find others who have been through this. \n\nMy husband and I have been married for a little over 6 years, together for almost 12. I was on the birth control pill for about 7-8 years and then had the Implanon implant put in December of 2012. In early 2015 we decided to embark on the very beginning steps of our baby making journey. I began taking prenatal vitamins, had a checkup and labs done, and had my Implanon removed in late August of 2015.\n\nWe had been trying to conceive for 7 months when I got a positive home pregnancy test March 30th of this year. To say we were excited would be an understatement. A close friend of mine from college had recently had a missed miscarriage and I had a bit of anxiety about possibly complications that could arise but since the doctor had never mentioned anything during my preconception check up, I kind of tried to put it in the back of my mind.\n\nI called my obgyn the following day to make my first ultrasound appointment. Since I had no pregnancy history or complications, they scheduled my appointment for my 8th week. I read this was ideally when they could see a strong heartbeat so I was fine with waiting a few weeks since this was standard procedure.\n\nOn (a Friday night) April 8th, I came home from my normal Friday night gym workout and noticed I had some brown spotting. I was immediately freaked out, told my husband, and turned to the Internet for advice. \"Brown blood is old blood, it is common.\"\n\nAfter 3 days of spotting I finally called the doctor and let them know what was going on. They confirmed that brown blood is just old blood and unless it became red, heavy, or I started having pain that there was no reason to come in until my appointment. In the mean time, my pregnancy symptoms increase tenfold.\n\nThe brown spotting stayed very light brown spotting for three weeks. Friday, April 29th was my first appointment, and we were very anxious. The ultrasound tech was very nice and told me that I was going to have a transvaginal ultrasound. I had one a few years prior to check for ovarian cysts (didn't have any) so it was not unfamiliar to me.\n\nWithin 30 seconds of the ultrasound starting we knew something was wrong. The tech had trouble finding what should be an 8week 4day gestational sac. Instead, she found what seemed to be a 5 week sac- with no blood flow. There also seemed to be some type of shadow in the upper part of my uterus. She informed us there was no heartbeat and I needed to see my doctor to discuss the options. We were devastated.\n\nMy husband and I sat in the exam room for almost and hour, most of the time in tears and shock. Finally, my doctor came in and said that she had consulted with one of the other doctors in the office just for good measure because she just wasn't sure what was going on in the ultrasound. She told me that I was indeed pregnant but that it was just not viable. It seems that the sac and fetal pole stopped developing between 5-6 weeks. She also said there appears to be a tennis ball sized blood clot in my uterus that absolutely had to come out as well. She gave me the options of letting my body try to take care of itself, taking misoprostol, or having a d&amp;c. \n\nI. Was. Distraught. I immediately said no to surgery and she wanted me to give it a few days to let me and my husband weigh the options and see her again Tuesday morning so we could make a plan. I told her I had a vacation planned for the following Saturday and she said that she would have me squared away by then and I definitely needed to go relax. The Doctor wanted to run some labs to double check my levels, too. \n\nMy body didn't take care of itself over the weekend so we knew I was left with two options- misoprostol or the d&amp;c. I turned to the Internet again for advice and it seemed like having a d&amp;c was much less emotionally and physically painful and hopefully would help me recover quicker. Although it was originally my last resort, I knew in my heart this was the best option for my recovery.\n\nTuesday morning I had a follow up ultrasound to see if anything had changed. The sac had moved a tiny bit further at my appointment my doctor told me that my labs were concerning to her. My HGC levels were roughly 132,000. She said that was high for a pregnancy not developing normally and that it could possibly be a complete or partial molar pregnancy.\n\nWhat?! What is that?!?\n\nShe explained that on the ultrasound it did not look like a typical molar pregnancy but we would definitely want to do and d&amp;c so we could collect the tissue and clean out the contents on my womb to reduce the risk of complications in the future.\n\nI am so glad that my husband and I had researched and I had prepared to go through with the procedure. I had a terrible bout if nausea in the exam room while my doctor was going over the ultrasound pics and she said she wanted to do the procedure that afternoon. I just wanted it all to be over.\n\nLuckily my husband was able to leave work and my work has been very understanding. I was told to be at the hospital at 2:30 for registration and labs and my procedure was scheduled for 4:30.\n\nI was a nervous wreck, sick from the pregnancy hormones, hungry and thirsty from having to fast for the procedure, and emotionally drained.\n\nThe registration process didn't take no time and I was quickly called back for labs. My doctor was concerned that I would need a blood transfusion so I had to have another round of labs. I was then taken back to the OR holding area and given my own room. Time was moving quickly but I was so nervous and sick that it felt like every minute was an eternity.\n\nBefore I knew it I was changed and had an IV. The entire team of doctors and nurses who were involved in my procedure were incredibly nice, helpful, informational, answered every single one of my questions, and treated me like I was their only concern. They gave me come Zofran through my IV, I took 3 pills by mouth- an antibiotic and two that keen stomach acid at bay. I had to sign a lot of papers but the next thing I know my doctor was there ready to do the procedure. She talked with me and my husband and asked if we had any final questions. She gave him the timeline of how long she thought the surgery would take and told him she would come talk to him the minute she was finished.\n\nThe nurses wheeled me back to the freezing cold operating room as I was wiping away loads of tears. They had a warm blanket blowing hot air on the operating table and they helped me move to the operating table. Still in tears I knew the anesthesia was coming soon but I just couldn't calm down. The sweet nurses held my hands as I got settled on the table and laid me back and bent right down in my face touching my forehead like I was their own child.\n\nI woke up in recovery, again crying, asking for my husband. Two new nurses came running to my side and welcomed me awake. They got me some crackers, and a Sprite, some pain medicine, and told me as soon as they checked me for bleeding they would take me to my husband.\n\nI was so relived to finally be awake. I wasn't too loopy but I had lots of questions. My husband explained that the doctor did not see a tumor, but the clot was indeed very large. The procedure itself only took her about 25-30 minutes but she waited to make sure I was clotting and contracting appropriately before finishing things up. I did not need a blood transfusion but I did lose quite a bit of blood.\n\nI was told that the pathology report would hopefully be completed by Friday and that I should be good to go on vacation Saturday.\n\nMy husband and cousin helped me get dressed and I wanted nothing more than to go home. I wasn't in a lot of pain, and surprisingly I didn't have as much bleeding as I thought I would have. The medicine they gave me at the hospital wore off about midnight and I took some more and tried to sleep. I did not sleep well the entire night, only about 3 hours total.\n\nI have rested for two days, my bleeding has stayed minimal, and my pain has been very manageable. I am really looking forward to some rest and relaxation.\n\nThe pathology results came back today and my doctor was incredibly surprised. It did come back as a complete molar pregnancy. She told me I would have weekly blood draws until we get a negative and then monthly blood draws until it is negative for 6 months.\n\nI go for my first appointment a week from Tuesday (two weeks post op) and am anxious to see what my numbers are. The nausea went away immediately and I already feel better physically. I imagine the emotional part will just take time.\n\nThe lab report said that the tumors were very very small and not cancerous.

It wasn't that I was superstitious.  As I thought about what the announcement would be (I had a really good plan), I couldn't stop thinking about the women in my life with fertility struggles. I even thought about including a part about how I knew how lucky I was to be expecting, and that I had positive thoughts for my friends ttc.  \n\nAs I advanced in my pregnancy, other people I knew announced due dates around mine. Since I was pregnant I was just happy for them. I thought it was cool that we would have babies around the same time.\n\nI never had a chance to do my pregnancy announcement and Scarlet was born premature at 21 weeks. She was alive for a very brief period.\n\nI have been very active on my FB since Scarlet was born (and just started a blog), and have noticed many friends coming out of the woodwork both via PM and on their own FB walls about fertility struggles.\n\nI sent someone a PM tonight to tell her that I was thinking of her after she had shared an article about miscarriage. She wrote back that her baby, lost in the 1st trimester was due around Scarlet's due date. \n\nHad I gotten around to making a pregnancy announcement, she probably would have read it and been sad due to her loss, even though she had no clue what my fate was. She would have thought \"I was supposed to have a baby in July too.\"\n\nIt got me thinking about \"due date clubs,\" and how many women are out before you know they were even in the club.  \n\nWe all just experience different aspects of that \"due date club.\"  My friend lost her baby at 9 weeks.  My daughter was born prematurely  at 21 weeks and died, and our other friends will hopefully have healthy babies.  I was completely oblivious when I was celebrating my growing belly and I had no clue that someone I care about was mourning her baby loss and was out there wishing that her belly was still growing. I know I was very \"out with my pregnancy\" in public always rubbing my belly, talking about baby, etc.  I would have stopped if I knew someone around me had fertility struggles, but I didn't know.  We don't know what we don't know.   I have friends out there due in July that probably just thought \"thank god that wasn't my baby\" when they read my FB announcement about Scarlet's birth and death. That is a very natural reaction and one that we too probably would had if in the same boat. \n\nI hope we all have an opportunity to be on the side that gets to bring home a live baby.  And until then, we know more about the process of trying to bring a baby in to this world and that in one \"due date club,\" there are so many people experiencing heartbreak. We will always be more sensitive to others and take care of others who unfortunately have to join our club.

I'm sure some of you have seen me around here the past few days. I had my D&amp;C on 5/3. I'll tell my story.\n\nOn March 30th, I found out I was expecting. After a few months of trying in the late winter, my SO &amp; I decided we weren't going to try anymore because nothing was happening. We decided I was going to go back to school &amp; we were going to work towards bettering ourselves. Wouldn't you know it that when we finally stoppped trying, we conceived. \n\nI was in shock &amp; denial because at that point, I was ok with not having a baby for a while. He was over the moon. I got it confirmed with the dr the next day, that's when i finally started to accept I was pregnant.\n\nAt about 5 weeks, I kind of experienced waning symptoms, so out of anxiety I scheduled an ultrasound. I should mention I also have experienced a CP so I was terrified of losing the baby. Even though it was early, we saw the gest sac &amp; yolk sac, my midwife said everthing looking \"perfectly in place\". I was elated &amp; naively felt I could not worry about anything. I scheduled an appt for 2 weeks later with my OB.\n\nOn April 19th, our world was turned upside down. We went in for the viability scan &amp; because of my coming and going symptoms I had a gut feeling something was wrong but I didn't want to believe it. Coconut only had a FHR of 73 and had only grown 1 day from the last ultrasound 2 weeks before. I was supposed to be 7 weeks, Coconut only measured 5w2d. Literally as soon as I saw it on the screen, I knew something was wrong. Dr. confirmed that baby had stopped growing &amp; will eventually cease all life all together. \n\nI refused to believe it. They took my hormone levels to see if they were rising the way they should. A week later, ON MY BIRTHDAY, I was called in for an emergency ultrasound because my hormone levels were rising, considering. I should have said no &amp; enjoyed my birthday. But I was optimistic.\n\nWe went in. The tech couldn't find any cardiac activity. I scheduled my D&amp;C. We were due to go out of state for a week so my SO can meet my family &amp; for my mom's wedding. It was set for 2 hours after I returned to where I'm living. \n\nThe whole trip was just.....stressful. The day after my birthday was my mother's wedding &amp; everyone thought I was happily pregnant. I wasn't going to ruin the joy of my mom's special day by telling people I had a dead baby inside of me. So I had to pretend that everything was ok. It was......hard.\n\nAnyway, we got through that week, told a few people after the wedding. After we landed back home, it was off to the hospital. The nurses were lovely. I was a floor under the maternity ward. I sincerely can't wait to have a baby in that hospital. The staff was amazing &amp; empathatic. \n\nThe D&amp;C went smoothly. I'd been cramping the whole week I was away. Not a painful cramp in anyway, just a dull throbbing sensation where the cramps usually are. Dr said it's because my body was trying to expel it, but my cervix was tightly closed.\n\nWe had Coconut sent to fetal medicine for genetic testing just to see what's going on. We have our appt for that soon. Right now, we are waiting to TTC because SO is enlisting. I would rather not be pregnant waiting for him to return from basic training.

I was due mid-september. First Pregnancy. On April 28th we went in for our anatomy scan and to find out the sex. We were so excited but found out the baby had no heartbeat, and there was a lot of swelling and no blood flow. I am an anxious worrier, and the whole pregnancy was terrified of a loss. Being this far along I had just finally let myself get excited. I couldn't believe this was happening, my literal worst fears. We chose a D&amp;E and were able to go through that process on May 2nd and 3rd. I was about 20/21 weeks. I felt catatonic for the next few days but am finally having times where I feel almost normal, and times where I break down in uncontrollable sobbing (which I feel is preferable to the catatonic feeling). Mother's Day was so hard, but I was able to get out of the house for a few hours. But it was hard, at first I felt dizzy and like I was going to vomit or pass out. I cried, and that helped. That same feeling came again today when trying to run an errand. I know/hope it will get better soon. We don't want to wait too long before TTC again because we were both so excited to be parents. But we want to be emotionally ready too.\n\nI wanted to post because reading all of your lovely words and stories has been so meaningful to me during this time. I am not alone. I am so scared for the future and adjusting back into daily life and TTC again but hearing how strong you all are gives me hope. Some of your words/stories have really stuck with me. Someone said \"I carried you for every second of your life; I'll love you for all of mine\". Thank you to whoever said that. We were lucky enough to get a footprint from the baby (we chose not to find out sex yet, we have the option to when the autopsy results come in) and I just look at it and want to hold that little foot and kiss it and say I love you. It's my most prized possession now. Its all I'll ever have of my baby.\n\nSorry for the sob story novel, first time posting anywhere ever. But thank you for all of your guys' strength to comment on this board. It's been so helpful and I hope to be of support to others too.", "stickied": false, "subreddit": "ttcafterloss", "subreddit_id": "t5_34scd", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Trigger- Introduction and late term loss", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/ttcafterloss/comments/4il1dc/trigger_introduction_and_late_term_loss/"}, {"author": "Stacieinhorrorland", "author_created_utc": 1410823372, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_text": null, "author_fullname": "t2_if2y5", "created_utc": 1462834407, "domain": "self.ttcafterloss", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/ttcafterloss/comments/4im8hc/question_about_cycle_after_mc/", "gilded": 0, "id": "4im8hc", "is_self": true, "link_flair_css_class": "question", "link_flair_text": "Question", "locked": false, "media_embed": {}, "num_comments": 9, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/ttcafterloss/comments/4im8hc/question_about_cycle_after_mc/", "retrieved_on": 1466440403, "score": 2, "secure_media_embed": {}, "selftext": "Hi again!
