I've been having nightmares about bleeding (even though I never had any bleeding before my MMC) and last night I had a nightmare that I found out I wasn't pregnant. \n\nThe past few days there has been a lot of baby talk - my MIL was talking about all of DH's cousins who are about to have babies in the next few months. And then today DH's best friend told him he'll be in our area all week because his sister (who lives near us) is about to be induced. Hearing about everyone else's perfect pregnancies and how theyre in their third trimester has really gotten to me and today, while DH and I were eating lunch, I made a comment that I would probably just kill myself if we were to lose this baby too. \n\n\nI've been having some suicidal thoughts this weekend because I am so overwhelmed with the thought of the onslaught of births that are about to take place. I would never actually do anything, but I made the comment and I couldn't take it back. I know I need to go to therapy and work through what is going on with me. I think in part it's hormones and also just a deep fear that this pregnancy isn't going to work out, but I also think I should have seen a grief counselor right after the MMC happened. We were on expensive insurance at the time and weren't able to afford it, but we've since switched providers and it is covered fully now. \n\n\nI guess I'm just looking for support.

So I miscarried last week on Wednesday. I'm still trying to process it all... I basically knew it was happening the second it started. When we got a BFP I was cautiously optimistic due to all the statistics I was reading about spontaneous loss in early pregnancy, so thankfully convinced my DH and immediate family to keep the news to themselves. Thankgod, because I can barely get through talking about it to anyone, even my husband. I feel detached from the whole situation. I\u2019m not angrily wondering \u201cwhy me?!\u201d, but even though we were taking precautions, I never really thought it would happen to me.\n\nI don\u2019t want to go into graphic details about my MC. But weirdly and coincidentally I went to get my hair done 4 days before it started, and my hairdresser confessed she had a MC in December and DID describe it in graphic detail. Al her graphic details were almost exactly my experience. So as soon as it started happening, I knew. I just knew. And of course I couldn't get into the doctor until almost 24 hours later. So I went online and Googled stuff about MCs  for hours. Almost every single comment I read said bleeding was normal and don't worry. Yeah, right. \n\nI stayed home from work for the first time in YEARS. It took some mental prep and convincing myself, but finally I figured if there was any time to take a sick day, this was the time. My husband stayed home, too. We went to the doctor and it was confirmed. We went to brunch  and I got a mimosa because why not. We slept all day. The worst of it happened the day before while I was at work, and I was back to work the next day. All in all, the MC lasted 4 days, which is about 1 day longer than my regular period. It was seriously like a maybe-a-little-heavier-than-normal period, and with less cramping. You would think something of this life changing magnitude would be worse.\n\nSo. My hairdresser is now 7 weeks pregnant. Only 1 week farther along than I was! But she thought she was farther along - she didn't really know, because she miscarried in December and they got pregnant the next cycle. Accidentally! They weren't trying, especially because they were NTNP in the first place, the doctor told her to hold off at least one cycle, and she was traumatized by it. \n\nHer story gives me hope. I feel bad I\u2019m not more sad about it all. I am sad in a very selfish way: I allowed myself to get excited, and start planning, because I\u2019m an over planner. We started talking about dates, child care, home improvements, nurseries, and announcements. And then almost as soon as this big life change happened, it wasn\u2019t happening anymore. I\u2019m disappointed all the planning I had done in my head isn\u2019t going AS PLANNED anymore, and it\u2019s not in my control. But I\u2019m not sad about the baby, because it wasn\u2019t a baby yet. I\u2019m not in denial, or angry, or wondering \u201cwhy me?\u201d. It was too early, my body did exactly what it was supposed to, and we\u2019ll continue trying.\n\nSo. I\u2019m still a little sad because it didn\u2019t go as I planned, but I\u2019m hopeful and eager to get pregnant. My coworkers have noticed I\u2019ve cut back on drinking alcohol and wonders about my one day out of the office and have actually hinted to or asked if we\u2019re expecting. Here\u2019s to hoping the old wives tales of getting pregnant soon after a MC is true, so we can pick up where we left off without missing a beat.\n\nThanks for reading, if you\u2019ve made it this far :) Apologies for the ramble. It\u2019s nice to get it out, even if it doesn\u2019t make much sense.", "stickied": false, "subreddit": "ttcafterloss", "subreddit_id": "t5_34scd", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Well, now that THAT'S over.

I recently moved to a completely different state, so this was a doctor I hadn't seen before. She was very nice. I told her about all my various concerns since the MS... ovulating late in my cycle, irregular cycles, super heavy bleeding and clots, severe cramps, etc.\n\nI'm getting my progesterone levels tested next month. Very happy about that. Interestingly, she said that having bad cramps during your period is actually a good sign of having sufficient progesterone.\n\nI feel like this is just the beginning of a long, long journey to get pregnant. Meanwhile, so many people around me are pregnant or have kids. A bunch of my friends are recently married/getting married soon, and it's going to kill me when they start announcing their pregnancies. I know I should be happy for them, and a part of me definitely is, but it's just so hard. :(\n\nAnyway, sorry for wall of text.

I figured I'd make a separate post about the hubby's follow up results because I know a lot of you have been with me on this journey over the past few months and have requested to be kept up to date. For those of you that don't know, my husband was diagnosed with testicular cancer in October. He actually had the appointment that discovered it on our EDD, but got the news the next day. What a way to make that day even worse, right? He had to have his right testicle removed. His semen analysis at that point was not very good. Basically, the cancer was most likely the reason we haven't been able to get pregnant since our loss last March.\n\nIt's been over three months since his surgery and we just did his follow up SA this week. His results are AMAZING!!!!! Back to normal!!!!! I am so relieved and feel like there's finally hope again.\n\nHere's the October results with the cancer:\nCount: 64 million/ml (surprisingly not terrible, but not great)\nMotility: 28% (I think. I don't have that report on me at the moment) only about 21% was progressive\nMorphology: 1%\nMany of the other factors, like viscosity, were \"abnormal\"\n\nJanuary's results:\nCount: 241 million/ml (wow! That's a lot of sperm)\nMotility: 85% with 80% progressive\nMorphology: 5%\nAll the other factors were back to \"normal\"\n\nThank you all for your support over the last 10 months since our loss and a special thank you for being there for me during the cancer diagnosis. Last year was the absolute worst year of our lives. I don't know how I would have managed without this sub.\n\nP.s. When I asked the Mr. to screen shot and send me his new results, he gave me the strangest look and asked why I needed them. I told him, \"I have to update Reddit!

We waited 5 months to try again (on purpose) and got pregnant on our 3rd cycle. We were so excited and felt blessed...but I was obviously nervous.\n\nI purposely made myself be excited and buy things/tell people/talk about it. I didn't want to feel disconnected or keep myself from being excited due to our previous loss. I thought it was only fair to that baby to give it my all. And I did a decent job of that, while still being nervous.\n\nI went through hell during my 1st trimester, again. Sick, sick, sick. Every single symptom you can think of, I had it. People kept telling me that's a good sign and I was annoyed by those comments. Because I had all that crap during my 1st pregnancy and loss, too. But I tried to remember they were trying to help/be nice. \n\nI was incredibly open about our 1st loss. That helped me, but later it helped others, which I was happy about. If I had to go through it, the least I could do is help others. So everyone who learned about my 2nd pregnancy was overjoyed for us, more so than they might have been if they didn't know about our 1st loss. I was able to talk about it a lot and had many prayer warriors and people thinking of us. Everyone knew how nervous I was, of course.\n\nIn the last 1.5 weeks, two of my closest friends told me that THEY are pregnant. They are due in September, and I thought I was either late August or early September. HOW EXCITING, right?!  I was pumped to get to be pregnant at the same time as them and we chatted about it daily.\n\nI went to my first appointment on Wednesday 2/3...I wasn't POSITIVE how far along I was, due to some weird periods after my previous D&amp;C, but I was thinking either 8+6 or 10+6....leaning towards further along.\n\nWell, obviously that appointment didn't go well. I knew it IMMEDIATELY when the ultrasound started...my husband didn't...I looked over at him and saw he was looking at the screen and trying to see what was going on. He glanced at me, I was staring at him, and he gave me a questioning look. So I whispered \"It's not good. Its not good at all...\"\n\nThe tech let us know that the baby was only measuring 7+3....and had no heartbeat. But my uterus was measuring 10+5. So, I would have been due in late August. I'd have had a baby this summer. And now...no. Just no. I likely won't even have one in 2016 now.\n\nFrom there it was a bit of a blur. My husband held me and we cried. Then we saw the doctor. I was given all the options, again, and chose a D&amp;C.  It felt like deja vu. Same office, same tech. UGH. I chose the D&amp;C for many reasons, but a big plus is that they offered to test the baby. I was worried they wouldn't until I maybe had a 3rd loss, but I was going to ask. I didn't have to, they immediately offered. And to test us, too.  \n\nI had my D&amp;C yesterday...&lt;24 hours after hearing/seeing the bad news. It's so surreal that 2 days ago I was going in to the doctor hoping to hear a heartbeat for the first time ever and find out my due date and get extra excited. Then BAM. No heartbeat, have surgery, no more baby. What is going on?! :(\n\nI'm in some pain from the D&amp;C, but its manageable. But emotionally I'm...feeling numb, I guess. I am sad sometimes, pissed off other times, but mainly I feel like I just can't process it. Is that normal?\n\nI'm already worried about my ability to be a good friend to my two pregnant friends. I know they'll both be sensitive of this and try not to talk to me too much about their pregnancies, but then I already feel bad about that. I am overjoyed for them (when I'm not numb), but just don't know how much I can handle. \n\nPeople keep telling me their stories of people they know who have had 2-5 miscarriages and now have healthy babies. Well that's great for them. It really is. And yes its LIKLEY that I could have healthy children in the future. But right now I wanted THAT one and I won't ever get to have that one. And yes, I'm worried there may be something wrong that means my husband and I can't make a living baby. Of course I'm worried about that. ARGH.\n\nWe would be amazing parents. We WANT to be parents. WHAT THE HELL?!\n\n\n\n\n", "stickied": false, "subreddit": "ttcafterloss", "subreddit_id": "t5_34scd", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "2nd pregnancy/2nd loss...I'm feeling...numb?

Today I went in for an ultrasound and my worst nightmare was confirmed: ectopic pregnancy at 6.5 weeks.  We'd been trying for over a year and this was our first, so we were over the moon and told most of my family and a few close friends.  Things moved so fast today that I'm still processing everything.  I can't stop crying and can't stop feeling like it's somehow my fault.   I just can't believe it's over so fast.  They gave me a rhogam shot (because I'm bloodtype A neg., and OUCH that hurts, can barely lift my arm), they checked my hcg (currently 3900) and gave me a methotrexate injection to end the growth of the embryo.  Anyone else had a similar experience?  How long does it take to feel better after the injection?  I feel so broken, both emotionally and physically.\n\n&gt;UPDATE:  Thank you so much for all your comments, stories, and support.  Your words have really helped me feel less alone in this and I am truly grateful.  One day at a time.  We are so anxious to start ttc as soon as we get the green light from my ob.\n\n&gt;UPDATE #2: Currently 4 days post mtx shot and omg this sucks.  I was feeling physically decent until today, when I was hit with horrible cramping and (sorry if tmi) rectal pressure.  Pretty sure it was constipation caused by my yogurt, steak, and fries only diet -- I have a Nutrition minor and *maybe* took the no folic acid thing a little too literally....well, I'm paying for it now.

I wasn't 100% sure I wanted kids quite then as we had just gotten married and were still adjusting to our new city. However, when I found out I was pregnant last Father's day, I realized I was ready. My doctor was never able to firmly tell me how far along I was; development appeared to have stopped around the 6 week mark or so but it had been roughly 10 weeks since I had gotten my positive test when I started miscarrying. At first, I was sad but not entirely surprised - I had had a D&amp;C and leep procedure the year before for some abnormal cells and my mother had taken 10 years to conceive me after her first miscarriage. \"This is not abnormal\" I said, \"I can enjoy drinking at Oktoberfest and football now\", I said. Most days, that was fine, but others not so much. My EDD would have been this week and trying not to focus on it too much, especially after losing it when I messed up the cake I was baking for a coworkers shower last week.\n\nWe agreed to not try again though until our house sold and we got through the second round of layoffs. (My husband and I both do IT work for an oil and gas company) The stress of it all we figured would just make things worse. So here we are, oil is still crap but we're looking at moving to a new city and our house has sold. So we are trying again, yay!\n\nMy cycles were SUPER off prior to my first pregnancy - 50+ days long. I had had blood work done and was taking a couple of different hormone pills, one of which increases fertility. Since my MC, my first few cycles were right at 31-33 days til this last one (39 days), so I figured things were fine. I've started temping this week and watching my MC. Should I go ahead and still have a visit with my NP to recheck hormone levels and see if I should be back on the pills I was taking? \n\nLooking forward to hearing everyone's stories and getting to know y'all.

I posted my story [last week] (https://www.reddit.com/r/ttcafterloss/comments/44v0z7/introectopiccant_stop_crying/) about my ectopic pregnancy diagnosis and the process of getting the methotrexate injection.  Welp...it didn't work out.  I had my \"day 7\" appointment to compare day 4 and day 7 hcg #s (they actually did decreased by 16% by the way), but around an hour before my appointment time, I started getting excruciating cramps and couldn't stand up.  I thought they were just from constipation (I'd been taking laxatives all week, because I was seriously *struggling* in that department), so I tried to battle thru the pain, but it was no use.  My husband had to drag me to my appointment as I was wailing, where it was discovered that I had internal bleeding and needed the surgery (laparoscopy) immediately.   Has this happened to anyone else, where the mtx shot was ineffective and your tube ruptured anyway? A terrifying ordeal, but I'm really happy to be healing properly now.  \n\n&gt;UPDATE:  YOU GUYS ARE AMAZING.  Thank you soooo much for all the support.

I posted about my very weird cycle and figured out I\u2019m dealing with a CP.  We are trying for our first and it\u2019s only our 2nd month ttc, hence my cluelessness about what a CP was.  I\u2019m 36 and DH is 42.  Quick background, AF was due 14dpo.  Lots of symptoms and very faint positives on 12, 13, 14, and 16dpo.  Figured I needed to wait longer for a darker line. Temp spiked on 17dpo, tested that afternoon, negative.  18dpo all symptoms were gone, temp crashed, tested negative.   \n\nI wasn\u2019t emotional about it yesterday as I was relieved to have an answer as to what was going on.  I was completely confused why I wasn\u2019t getting a stronger positive.  Last night the emotions kicked in.  I\u2019m exhausted and weepy today.  I didn\u2019t explain it to my husband last night since he seemed to be preoccupied with a job interview he has today.  So I just feel alone in dealing with it.  I\u2019m trying to stay positive that at least I got pregnant on the 2nd try, but I\u2019m sad and angry that it didn\u2019t stick and that my cycle is messed up now and I don\u2019t know what to expect for the next cycle.\n\nNot having gone through this before\u2026should I all my doctor to notify her or no point?  AF is 6 days late at this point and no bleeding or spotting at all.  When should I expect that to start?  Some of the symptoms came back mildly today like cramping, sore back and boobs so I\u2019m expecting it to start\u2026but nothing.

I came upon this group in November, shortly after my mmc and subsequent D&amp;C. I carried my little for 16 weeks. I am so sad about so many things. Still. I can't seem to shake the grief. And a part of me doesn't want to, because it is the only thing connecting me with the baby. I wanted this baby so much.\nMy husband and I haven't communicated much about the whole ordeal, except one conversation I forced because I needed to know what to tell the doctor about contraception during my post op check up. At that time, we (I) decided not to get any, because we may want to try again in the future. It had taken us until this past week to even try sex, and I was heartbroken when he grabbed condoms each time. We don't temp, track cycles, or anything, just kind of leave it up to chance, but this was like taking all hope of getting pregnant out of the mix. And that hope was one of the things keeping my grief from swallowing me whole. I know I should try to talk to him, but I can barely ask about normal, mundane things now- communication in general is crippled now.  My husband has been holding our family together, because apart from work, I have not been a helpmate.  I really don't blame him for not wanting to add to the chaos of our life. \nThanks for reading.

I have a lot of favorites, but it's up there!\n\nAnyway, Barbara &amp; Adam Maitland are the main characters and they are looking forward to their staycation at home in their big beautiful house. In one of the first scenes, a pushy family member (who is also a realtor) stops by to not only interrupt their alone time but to insist (yet again) that the house is too big for them and that they should sell to a FAMILY with KIDS. After she leaves, Adam assures Barbara that they can \"try again\" on the vacation. \n\nBefore my loss, I could see the pain in their eyes, but didn't really think much about this scene other than \"Jane\" was a bitch. Now I am so moved that such an interaction happened. This scene didn't have to be there, the realtor didn't need a face, we could see on our own that this was a huge house, the skeleton key could have been given or found to Lydia in another way. The writers specifically chose to make the Maitlands struggle with creating a family and specifically chose to show a family member be incredibly insensitive to their journey. Are they dealing with infertility? Miscarriages? Whatever the case, I am so thankful to have this scene today. \n\nI hope you all have a wonderful weekend.
