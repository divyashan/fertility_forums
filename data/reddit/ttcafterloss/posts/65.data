Unfortunately we found out during an 8 week ultrasound that there was no heartbeat. The next day we met with our doctor who scheduled me for a D&amp;C for the following week. Then, I had to travel for my sister's wedding where I was the maid of honour. I smiled for pictures, drank champagne and gave toasts while inside my heart was broken. It was really important to me that my sister get her day. That Sunday, my husband had to fly back to work. We couldn't afford for him to stay home because he just finished a two week vacation. He couldn't be with me for my D&amp;C, my sister came to stay with me. He's gone for a month and I think that is what is making this so much harder.

It's so disheartening. To make matters worse our family friends (same age as us) are going to have a baby. I want to be happy for them but I feel so bitter. My mother in law recently sent us a picture of a baby blanket she knitted for them and I felt like crying on the spot. Everyone, and i mean everyone, in our family is asking us when we are going to have kids. I just smile and say \"sooner rather than later\" but i really want to say \"actually we had a miscarriage this year so kindly mind your own business\". I thought this cycle we struck gold since AF was late and I am an extremely refular gal but everything came up negative. Then this morning it came so I know it didn't work. Also one of my highschool students was my cashier  at the store so she caught me buying a dumb amount of pregnancy tests. So awkward. I couldn't even look at her today. I'm buying everything online for the rest of my existence. \n\nI have this overwhelming fear that i won't wver be able to have a baby. It keeps me up most nights and the anxiety feels suffocating. I'm 27 and in good health. I have regular cycles and nobody in my family has problems with fertility (with my mom and my sister it's like they can sneeze and get pregnant). My bestfriend is getting married next year with no real set date (anywhere from july to Oct) so this could be our last month of trying until next year because if we do get pregnant we wouldn't want to miss her wedding as we are both in the wedding party.

How do I move on?*** \n\nI am currently 4 months out from our TFMR and I have recently visited a baby loss grief counselor with my husbands as well as a baby loss support group called MEND. \n\nFor the first two months after the loss, all I felt was suffering and pain. I had SO MUCH PAIN. I thought man - if I just died today, my pain would end and the suffering would end and I would just be happy about that. I wanted an easy and painless way out of suffering the loss of my baby. And I now realize that the is NO EASY WAY OUT OF THIS AT ALL. You just have to endure the suffering of the horrible, terrible loss that you experience in your life. \n\nLast week I went to a meeting after seeing another girls post on here about how she found group loss helpful, so I said why not. I was scared to go, but I went anyway. I sat in a group of 30 ladies who all experienced infant death, stillbirth, childbirth complications, terminations for medical reasons and miscarriages. All ladies suffered losses 1 month to 15 years. \n\n***AND ALL OF THEM, ALL OF THEM bawled their eyes out*** when it came their turn to talk about their lost baby. ALL OF THEM. Ladies 15 years out bawled just as much as the one that lost 1 months ago. This really put it in perspective for me that I will NOT get \"over this\". The grief strength of spikes doesn't really get lower, they just become less frequent. Where 1 week it was constant 100% grief spike, now it's a 100% grief spike 5 times per day for 30 minutes at a time. \n\nThis is just something that's SUCH A HARD awful thing to carry and this is how MY LIFE turned out. And we all know life is not fair, at all. This is a part of MY life now. I didn't want this part, I didn't want that at all. I wish I could take it back and never experience it. But alas, this is what we have. We can't change what happened no matter what we say ***AND BARGAINING is normal experience of grief.*** \"If I took more vitamins, if I did x y z, if I went in earlier, if I bla bla bla.\" Yes, the what if game - that doesn't CHANGE ANYTHING. But some how we still love to play. 4 Losses later this is what the score is. \n\n***What if game*** 4 : ***Me*** 0 \n\nWell played, what if game, well played. \n\nSo what I learned from attending the loss group and grief counseling for baby loss is that you are the same but different, and nothing will really ever be the same and you have to figure out who you are and who you will be again as a person and as a couple. Also, the counselor gave my husband 3 years. She said, you are signing up for this for 3 years - to feel these things and the recovery, the feelings are extremely strong for those first 3 years. \n\nAs we were 3 months out from the loss, it was now conceivable that \"wanting to go back to how it was\" is not going to ever be that same place. It has to be a new place that understands the pain we have endured and that we now just have to keep waking up and doing something. We may never have a child, we don't know what the complications did and we know he has an issue and I now may too. We have no clue. \n\n***But the day I went to that baby loss group, I realized what I was trying to do was go back to feeling how I did before the loss. I was fighting to really get the feeling of innocence and win against the WHAT IF GAME. And there is no winning.***\n\nGoing there helped me understand that I have lost that game. And I can not return to who I was before. And I have to move forward knowing that.\n\n&amp;#x200B;", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "ttcafterloss", "subreddit_id": "t5_34scd", "subreddit_subscribers": 3841, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "What I realized after attending a baby loss support group 4 months post TFMR.

I just wanted to introduce myself and share my post-m/c regimen as we gear up for our next try. Please share your thoughts, feedback, experiences, or any other changes you recommend I add! \n\nI had a 6-8 week loss (couldn't date it exactly) in early August. It was horrible, I was alone the day it passed and I'll always carry that loss in my heart. We named the baby so that we could keep it in our thoughts and prayers. I still have some bad days (especially when strangers, church friends, family, etc. ask us when we're having kids and little do they know, I lost one). I'm in a much better place now, and I'm just trying to think positively about the future and simply focus on what I can do to change the outcome next time. It took 40 days to ovulate, and I actually feel fortunate that it even happened at all. I'm now waiting for my first actual post-m/c period, and then the doctor said we can try again next cycle. \n\nDuring the m/c ultrasound the doctor diagnosed me with enlarged ovaries and multiple cysts (PCOS). That was a big surprise for us as I have regular 32day cycles, no male pattern hair or balding, glucose tests always came back perfectly normal, etc. However, now thinking about it, I did have a hard tine adjusting after quitting BC in 2012. I got terrible acne for the first time in my life (gone now due to miraculous accutane) and it took like 3 years for cycles to regulate. So I'm assuming I've had PCOS all this time. Part of me hates myself for not finding this out before we started trying, if the loss was avoidable, if my body matured a bag egg because of the cysts or insulin resistance. \n\nSo.. I did lots of research (PTL for pubmed), and re-read certain sections of It Starts With The Egg and Impatient Woman's Guide to Getting Pregnant. I had dumbly skipped the chapters on PCOS and m/c... ignorance is bliss. :(\n\nHere's my current regimen:\n\nInositol \n\nXue Fu Zhu Tang\n\n250mg Magnesium\n\nCoQ10\n\nFish Oil\n\nPrenatal Gummies\n\nIron\n\nZinc\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAlso, I was drinking green tea every morning and this time around I plan to quit all caffeine until the second trimester at least. Even tho the docs all say it's okay to have a cup of tea, or even coffee, I subsequently read studies that said green tea impairs the uptake of folic acid. I used to drink coffee (sadly gave it up about a year ago), and my friend introduced me to something called Teechino - basically herbs and nuts, roasted, that legit smells and tastes like coffee! But no caffeine, no acid, high potassium, soluble fiber, etc. I'm curious if anyone else has tried it? I can't believe they don't tell more coffee-drinking women about this as an option!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nXOXO to you all, hope I didn't bore you with my post, looking forward to making some new friends here.

I was going to be a stay at home mom so I don\u2019t have a job right now either and am wondering who would hire someone like me (can\u2019t work with kids right now, it\u2019s just too painful)\nI used to think of myself as a very happy person who truly appreciated everything she had. I often thought \u201cI\u2019m really lucky\u201d. \nNow I am the complete opposite. I cry all the time and I thought it may very slowly get easier but so far it has not gotten any easier, I really don\u2019t have ANY thoughts that are not about my baby. The fact that his death was due to misdiagnosis makes it that much harder because it should have been prevented.\nNow I am really concerned how things will be in a future pregnancy. (Which isn\u2019t happening anytime soon but I know even after a while I won\u2019t ever be the carefree happy person I was) I am worried that the stress will negatively impact a future pregnancy. I always thought my baby was going to be a very happy baby because of how happy I was. \nI am worried about a miscarriage.\nI was sure I was going to be a laid back mom and now I can\u2019t see myself not stressing over sids or something happening to them. \nI am going to go to therapy but I obviously will never be the person I used to be and I know I\u2019ll probably still cry about my son every day for years to come.\nHow can I help a future baby during a future pregnancy not get all the stress hormones/ sadness that I feel. How can I make sure I don\u2019t become a crazy overprotective helicopter mom? \nHow does sadness impact a baby during pregnancy?

It was a very unexpected pregnancy, as I had an IUD, and as we\u2019re long distance and in the process of getting me immigrated to the US, we\u2019re waiting a couple years to try to have a kid. (I\u2019m 26, my fianc\u00e9 is almost 28, so we figure we\u2019ll start trying when I\u2019m 29 and he\u2019s 30.) It\u2019s been the worst thing that\u2019s ever happened to me, just really really hard. I lost most of my local family in the process - I\u2019m estranged because they\u2019ve never treated me that well but were really not great in the aftermath of the miscarriage. Luckily my fianc\u00e9 is really amazing and supportive, and I know the miscarriage was really hard on him too. \n\nI would have been due some time between December 13th and 20th, it was hard to calculate because I wasn\u2019t having regular periods and when they did the ultrasound the baby wasn\u2019t developing properly at all. My birthday is December 24th. I used to love my birthday and the holidays. If things had gone okay with the pregnancy, I would\u2019ve been celebrating Christmas and my birthday with my fianc\u00e9 and a newborn. I\u2019d also planned on, that because of my job shutting down between Christmas and New Years, I\u2019d spend a couple weeks in Tennessee where my fianc\u00e9 lives around that time. I recently essentially lost my job (extended \u201ctemporary\u201d layoff) and have to find something else, so I likely won\u2019t be able to take that trip anymore. I was planning to have a little birthday dinner there around the 20th and thought maybe that\u2019d take my mind off things. I\u2019m estranged from most of my local family and we\u2019re Jewish anyway, so I\u2019m probably not doing anything for Christmas this year now. \n\nHow do I...do things so I don\u2019t lose my mind in December? It used to be my favourite month and now it just seems like it\u2019s going to be devastatingly hard. I would\u2019ve been in my third trimester by now. I would have had a baby by my birthday.

My husband had just started trying after our honeymoon and it was a really weird time because this insane diagnosis had just come out of absolutely nowhere and then we were supposed to be excited for this pregnancy. I decided to tell my dad about the pregnancy because I thought maybe the prospect of having his first grandchild would give him added strength to fight through his cancer. He was excited as he could be given how weak he was and I just had a bad feeling. Sure enough the spotting started, back pain, and just plain ol\u2019 womanly intuition told me this wasn\u2019t going to happen. Found out on my 29th birthday I would be miscarrying based on my HGC levels of 48, I was 5 weeks pregnant at this point and this number was way too low to be that far along. A couple days later the miscarriage happened. One month to the day after that my dad died. That summer almost destroyed me. I lost half of who I was and who I was going to be all in the matter of a month.  I really took the time to do the whole self care thing. Cried until I physically couldn\u2019t, laid in bed, went for acupuncture for both grief and fertility purposes and with the support of my husband some how started feeling normal again. 8 months later after a fun vacation with my husband and best friend I got pregnant again. Not going to lie, I was NOT excited... it took me 3 days to even tell my husband I was pregnant again because all of the fear and anxiety came flooding back the second I peed on that stick. The entire pregnancy was miserable. Didn\u2019t help my appendix ruptured when I was 14 weeks, just worked up the courage to share the news with our family and friends and I had to have emergency surgery. Thankfully this time everything worked out and I gave birth to a gorgeous, healthy (big ass) baby boy! Right now, he is 10 months old and my period, which I\u2019ve had since 7 weeks PP (like really? So unfair) was late last week. Took a test on the second day of missed P and tested negative but I wasn\u2019t convinced. I went back the next day and pulled it out of the trash and sure enough faintest line ever. Waited a couple more days and bought 3 more and definitely obvious line. Went in for a blood test on what would be 5 weeks 2 days and got the bad news that my HGC levels were once again super low and out of range for what I should be. Clocking in at 166 when the test chart shows I should be over 1000 at this point and was close to 3000 at the same point in my successful pregnancy. Having been through this before I know what comes next and have just been waiting and waiting. Because my doctor went away for the weekend I was unable to get another requisition for a blood test so I can monitor the HGC levels, and my requisition for an early ultrasound is also useless at this point because they won\u2019t be able to see anything anyways and just tell me to come back. So I\u2019ve been having wicked back cramps all weekend and just waiting for the worst. So far no spotting or bleeding, hoping it\u2019s not a missed miscarriage and I\u2019ll have to take the drugs to force It, I just want it to happen naturally and get it over with already. Sorry for the long post but I\u2019m afraid pregnancy is forever ruined for me. How can I ever try for more kids and mentally withstand another pregnancy? Every twinge, every test, every part of it stresses me out. Not knowing what is going on in my own body right now is probably the worst feeling ever. I don\u2019t know if I can ever do this again. I wanted 3 or 4 kids so badly but now I don\u2019t know. I thought having a successful pregnancy after my first MC would give me the confidence I needed to keep going and growing my family but now this shit again? I know I\u2019m so lucky to even have my son but I still can\u2019t help but feel so let down and angry with my body and the universe. I can\u2019t handle any more loss in my life.

I've read many other stories and mine is another one that is similar to the others that are here. \n\nI've been trying to conceive since 2015. We tried naturally with no success for most of 2015. In 2016 I went to the OB, and since my periods are very infrequent they put me on Clomid with no monitoring, which resulted in me getting pregnant but losing the baby at 7 weeks. I had to take a few months off from trying after that and I tried again in 2017 for a few months using clomid. I lost the baby again around 7 weeks. They did chromosomal testing and it came back negative, so they classified me as unexplained infertility. The OB told me I could keep trying because sometimes it takes 4-5 miscarriages until you get success, so 2 is \"no big deal\". I got rid of him and went to a new OB group. My new OB is amazing and referred me to a RE to get testing this year. The RE told me I have PCOS and I'm on my second monitored IUI cycle. They have me on metformin, letrozole, baby aspirin, ovidrel trigger shot, and progesterone suppositories the 2nd day after ovulation. The RE has suggested that we should try 3 IUI cycles and if no success we should move on to IVF with PGS. \n\nI am terrified of getting pregnant again, and also terrified of not having any children. I'm exhausted mentally and emotionally. My relationship with my husband has had many ups and downs during this period, mainly due to my moods. Out of my real life friends, half of them haven't even tried to get pregnant yet and the other half that have tried have already been successful, usually within the first couple months of trying. They are supportive, but they just don't understand. I'm sick of hearing random anecdotal stories about people who \"stopped trying, and then fell pregnant\" or \"went on vacation and got pregnant\". I'm sick of hearing them tell me to \"just relax\". I'm sick of this entire process. Thanks for hearing me out and letting me vent.

We've been trying for 8 months. We did get pregnant at 6 months, but I lost my first and only baby at 6 weeks.\n\nWhen I was pregnant I felt special. I felt happy. Many of you ladies would agree, after you lost the first, you feel that the second pregnancy (if it happens) won't be the same. \n\nMy sister had a loss too. However, her timeline is different. She got pregnant the very first try, lost that one and then got pregnant the month immediately after her d and c. She has a living child. In the same amount of time I've been trying, she had miscarried and was well into her 2nd trimester. She's been supportive, but at the same time keeps talking about her wanting to have a second child. She said if \"I get pregnant and it dies o well\". She tells me getting pregnant is easy, you just use an app ( same one I have been using) She doesn't mean it, but a lot of what she says minimalizes my loss. \n\nI just found out from my mother she  stopped her birth control today. \n\nI wish I can tell her she can't have one yet. That I already feel that a new pregnancy wouldn't feel as special to me and that her having one at the same time would hurt. I want to tell her that if she gets pregnant before me, it will tear me apart. That I've always lived in the shadow of my brother's illness and her successes. That I just want to experience something that's my own. I don't want to be compared to anyone but my former self. \n\nI'm struggling with the feeling that I won't be as happy. I feel selfish for having these thoughts. I feel guilty that experiencing  a successful pregnancy wouldn't be sufficient for me. I am worried it might not ever happen for me. I am scared that if it does I will have to let go again. I'm angry at the way life has dealt me these cards. \n\nI feel overlooked.

We are friendly but not extremely close. I\u2019m not sure exactly how far along she was but it\u2019s near 5 months. This is her second loss, she had a miscarriage in T1 last year in October. She has two living children. \n\nWe both started the school year pregnant. I\u2019m at 13+4 and still very nervous. I have no living children and have had 2 previous miscarriages. One we found out at 9 weeks and the second was a blighted ovum. Last school year I did reach out and sent her a card and we talked after her loss and again after my loss in January. She had announced her pregnancy at work and her loss was communicated to staff by the principal.\n\nThis year neither of us have announced at work but we both have told some co-workers so people know. We hadn\u2019t explicitly talked to each other about being pregnant. I know about the loss because a co-worker shared it with me. I am not happy about this and told her it was not her information to share. \n\nBut now I know this information and  I am unsure of what to do. I want to reach out and let her know I am here for her but I don\u2019t know if I should. \n\nI had such mixed emotions after my losses. I of course appreciated when people I had told about my pregnancy or loss reached out to me. I resented when aunts and uncles that I knew my parents had shared my pregnancy and losses with did not reach out and just acted like nothing had happened. I was glad when cousins and friends of my parents (who they shared our news with) acted like nothing had happened because I really didn\u2019t want to talk to them on such a personal level if things were going good or bad to begin with. \n\nSo there\u2019s all that and on top of it, I\u2019m pregnant so maybe she doesn\u2019t want to hear from me at all. I have no idea what to do. Having gone through this does not make it any easier for me to know what to do especially since she was further along in her pregnancy than I have ever been. \n\nI feel sick thinking about what she is going through and I want to be there to block and stop every dumb asshole who is going to tell her that heaven needed an angel or that this time just wasn\u2019t meant to be. \n\nPlease help. \n\n", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "ttcafterloss", "subreddit_id": "t5_34scd", "subreddit_subscribers": 3875, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Co-worker had a loss, should I reach out?", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/ttcafterloss/comments/9ix693/coworker_had_a_loss_should_i_reach_out/"}, {"author": "eatemupcoogs", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_1288o6", "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1537923181, "domain": "self.ttcafterloss", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/ttcafterloss/comments/9ixubk/ladies_how_did_you_treat_yourselves_after_your/", "gilded": 0, "gildings": {"gid_1": 0, "gid_2": 0, "gid_3": 0}, "id": "9ixubk", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_css_class": "question", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_template_id": "64bc0a4e-a73f-11e4-8d5c-22000bc1c25f", "link_flair_text": "Question", "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 19, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/ttcafterloss/comments/9ixubk/ladies_how_did_you_treat_yourselves_after_your/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1537923182, "score": 3, "selftext": "As far as self care goes?

Found out a femoral hernia had recurred 2 days after BFP. When the loss happened, it was assumed a surgery and a year of WTT would commence. A CT scan and multiple surgical consults later...they clear me to TTC again. They tell me to just keep a close eye on the hernia and know that emergency could be a potential (but they won't fix it now if I'm planning to be pregnant anytime in next 2 years).\n\nSo...in the week between the loss and the final surgical consult, my fiancee + parents booked us a trip to Punta Cana early November (active zika area). As a surprise. Without telling me. \n\nOOPH. Yay but noooo! \n\nCommence daily wavering between canceling the trip and starting to TTC *now* OR living it up until February 2019. \n\nOn one hand, I'm scared we have a long road ahead of us and waiting until February sounds scary-far away, and my god I want to be pregnant again like right the eff now.\n\nOn the other hand.... we have no known medical reason to rush, and 4 months of travel (I'd have like 4 upcoming trips vs cancelling them all bc pregnant with hernia = no flying), loosing more weight, sushi and medical marijuana indulgence sounds okay. \n\nThat one month of being pregnant was really, really rough to be completely honest. \n\nI'm pretty embarrassed at how first world-y this is...I want to go on the awesome trip, but I also don't want to incur the 3 month waiting penalty for going. I can't have both, and I wish someone would have asked me before booking flights. :( \n\n**Note**: This is a free trip with family to an all-inclusive resort (perk of my dad's job), and airfare is reimbursed (if we go, not if we cancel). So it literally costs more money to cancel than to go. We can't just pick another destination, its either go or cancel and lose $800 airfare.

I can't stop crying. My daughter was seemingly fine until I went to my follow up ultrasound at 25 weeks. My NIPT came back negative and my doctor said my daughter looked great at her 20 week anatomy scan, except her couldn't get a good view of her heart because she was in the wrong position. He told me to come back at 24 weeks.\n\nThat appointment got cancelled by the doctor so I had to reschedule at 25 weeks. I went in and he looked at her heart and told me it was fine. Then he went back over her face and told me he couldn't find a nasal bone and that I should go to maternal fetal medicine in the next few weeks. My heart sank and I insisted I be seen immediately.\n\nAn hour later I was at MFM getting another sonogram. I couldn't stop crying and I had to stop looking. The doctor came in with a laundry list of anomalies. Not only did she not have a nasal bone, she did not have a nose. She also had a cleft in the front of her skull, her eyes were set far apart, a large cyst in the back of her brain, and the vessels around her heart were narrowed and misaligned. I was in shock, I don't know how my doctor missed all of it.\n\nMy husband and I were told that she had some sort of genetic disorder and I had an amnio done. It came back normal. We decided we could not risk her suffering and it would not be fair to our 2 living children. We decided to terminate the pregnancy. It was the most heartbreaking decision I ever had to make.\n\nWe had the procedure done about 2 weeks later. We received and injection to stop her heart and I was induced. I told her I loved her the entire time. At first I was afraid to look at her because I knew she had facial deformities but then I thought about how she is my daughter and I had to be brave and give her the respect she deserved.\n\nIt was shocking. Her face had never fused. There were no open clefts but her nose had never formed and her nostrils were set far apart. I feel so bad for being shocked at her appearance, my own child. She was a baby at that point, not a fetus. She had reached viability even though it would have been tough. But I know she would have have had a hard short life.\n\nI became obsessed with finding out what did this to her. Eventually I found a disorder called acromelic frontonasal dysostosis and everything fit. The pictures looked just like her. It is extremely rare with an occurrence of less than one in a million. There are about 20 documented cases of it in scientific literature. We are still waiting on the genetic testing to confirm.\n\nI am completely lost. I can't stop crying and thinking of her. I am so mad my doctor didn't notice it until it was so late and that he missed so much. Her medical records show that he had checked off nasal bone and face seen at 20 weeks which is a lie. There are no pictures in her file from the 20 weeks scan. I am going to therapy and it helps but I don't know how I will ever get past the loss of my very wanted daughter. Her name is Vanessa.\n\nSorry for the long rant.

There was no heartbeat and baby was only measuring 8 weeks. This baby was very wanted and my husband and I were devasted. I took misprostol that evening and after a hard night of labour at home, passed what I thought was everything.\n\nFor the next 3 weeks, I went for weekly HCG blood draws and my hormones were dropping very slowly. I had some bright red bleeding again after 2 weeks and so my midwife sent me for another ultrasound. This ultrasound showed that I had a thick uterine lining of retained tissue. I was so dissapointed. I thought I was gearing up for a period but instead was sent for a D&amp;C. (this is now 4 weeks post MC) \n\nI've been having a really hard time. I can't stop counting weeks. I should be 19 weeks but instead today marks 2 months post MC and 1 month post D&amp;C and I still haven't gotten a period. I know I'm still within the realms of \"normal\" but I naively thought I would be pregnant again already. \n\nMy best friend and I were 6 days apart. I cry every time after I see her. Some days my thoughts are darker than I ever thought possible and some days are better. \n\nI'm wondering if you can shed some light on if I count my MC from Misprostol as day 1 or from my D &amp; C as day 1 (in terms of when I should expect a period) \n\nAs of last Friday, my HCG has finally lowered to 10.

I really tried to make it shorter but it\u2019s still long. \n\nI\u2019s been over two weeks since my TFMR and think I\u2019m ready to introduce myself. I think it will be somehow therapeutic for me. I feel really lonely and I don\u2019t have anyone to talk to. I also hope it will help someone in the future. When I faced the condition of my baby for the first time I couldn\u2019t really find much about it on reddit, so maybe my story can help someone in the future.\n\nWe were very happy to find out I was pregnant in June and decided not to tell anybody until 12 weeks, se we wouldn\u2019t jinx it. When bleeding started I was prescribed progesterone and booked an early ultrasound. We told our parents as we knew we might need their support. At 6 weeks appointment our baby was measuring just fine and there was a heartbeat. The one odd detail was that there was no yolk sac (still not sure if that is relevant, the doctor couldn\u2019t decide). They told us that it was fine but we needed to come back for the follow up in 2 weeks. And so we did. During the 8 weeks appointment everything looked good. Stronger heartbeat, yolk sac where it should be, proper measurement. We finally agreed to my mother\u2019s intense nagging that we should let her spread the news. And everything was marvelous until we went for our 13 weeks NT scan which showed that our baby had a giant omphalocele which contained whole liver, intestines, and stomach. I was crushed, but my husband stayed optimistic (perhaps only for my sake), telling me that it will fix itself (there was a tiny little chance for that to happen during the next two weeks). But it didn\u2019t. The 15 weeks follow up showed that during the period of 14 days our baby has only grown 8. The omphalocele was bigger than before. We were told that there might also be problems with baby\u2019s spine and legs, so we had to go to a public hospital the following week for CVS. \n\nI need to mention that where I live, public hospitals are AWFUL. So we came at dawn and waited in this insane line for 6 hours. Then they called me banning my husband from joining me. The staff were talking only to each other saying how small (the gap between the estimated days and actual days expanded) and thin the baby was, making a really inappropriate, hurtful comments. I don\u2019t know how to translate it so let\u2019s say they were calling my baby \u2018this bizarre midget who probably has a triploidy\u2019. Then they told me to sign papers that I consent to the procedure, but wouldn\u2019t let me mark the type of the procedure. Then the doctor decided to go with the amniocentesis (since one of the nurses came to learn that, not CVS) \u2013 still not talking to me at all. I was lying there with my eyes on the ceiling trying to be somewhere else when suddenly I felt the needle in my uterus and started to cry, really hard. I won\u2019t lie \u2013 it hurt. I cried mostly because I felt mistreated in this really hard moment of my life. I felt like I was there so the nurse could learn. And she wasn\u2019t good. She didn\u2019t know how to do it. She was poking for far too long in my body, trying to change the position of the needle, not knowing what to do. Finally, after what seemed like forever, she managed. So they wrapped the sample up and started to fill in some forms. In the end, the doctor looked at me irritated (I was still crying) and told me something like \u2018There is no need to cry, I didn\u2019t say that your baby is going to die FOR SURE\u2019. I left as fast as I could telling my husband that I will never ever come back to this place. \n\nSince my NT scan I have read a lot about omphalocele, including stories on facebook group. We knew we need to discuss our options. No, not with the doctors. Just with each other. Where I live termination is barely legal and they wouldn\u2019t consent to it unless there were chromosomal abnormalities or I would be dying. We got the QF-PCR results quite quickly \u2013 no abnormalities. And it was a girl. It was so much harder to make the decision knowing that it was our daughter, a real person with a name at this point. But we knew she wouldn\u2019t survive. They would make her suffer from indescribable pain and fear just to see how much further can medicine go. And she wouldn\u2019t make it. Not with the omphalocele, not with no abdominal cavity to put the organs back, not with her heart being at that point so completely out of place, ready to be pulled to omphalocele sac. So we decided we have to let her go.\n\nWe knew we couldn\u2019t do it where we live, so we had to plan this whole trip to a different country. And there we finally had been taken care of. The medical staff was AMAZING. They cared for us and supported us. They offered us additional ultrasound and consultation. They did everything they could to make us feel safe. I delivered my daughter at 18 weeks, but she was measuring 1,5 weeks less. We were able to see her and say goodbye. I think I was in shock at that time so I didn\u2019t ask to hold her and that I will regret forever. She was precious. Leaving her was really difficult for me, but knowing that her ashes will be spread with the ashes of other children in a beautiful place helped. She won\u2019t be alone. We named her Felicia in hope that she will have better luck wherever she went from here.\n\nAnd now I am home, with a broken heart, missing her so so SO much. And I can\u2019t really talk to anyone. As I said \u2013 termination here is a very controversial subject. And right know we don\u2019t feel the strength to defend ourselves from pro-life people who would call us murderers. They wouldn\u2019t understand that we chose to suffer, so our baby girl wouldn\u2019t have to. The only people who know about our TFMR are my parents, my husband\u2019s mother and her mother (despite our request not to tell ANYONE, my MIL told her mother, but that\u2019s a rant for different occasion). Everyone else, including my siblings, had been told that I miscarried. So it feels really lonely, not being able to talk about what I have been through and how I feel.\n\nI know it was longer that it should have been. But it really helps me to write. If there is anybody looking for information about omphalocele or seeking support, don\u2019t hesitate to send me a message. Thank you very much for reading  \ud83c\udf3b \n\nTL;DR: TRMF at 18 weeks due to omphalocele, had to travel to another country for the procedure, can\u2019t talk about it to anyone.

I've been waiting to introduce myself until we were actually starting IVF. \n\nMy story is sucky. In December 2015 my husband and I decided to start ttc. In March of 2016 I had a miscarriage. I was devastated but we kept going. It took 18 months for us to conceive lily with the help of clomid. I was very excited for our daughter. I had a seemingly normal pregnancy with no complications. On February 25th 2018, our precious little girl lily was born, not breathing. She was quickly revived and was breathing but not well on her own. I knew something was wrong but I didn't know how wrong. \n\nOn February 27th, Lily was diagnosed with zellweger syndrome. You can Google it but basically my child had severe organ issues, was extremely mentally disabled, and would never live beyond 6 months to a year. What they didn't tell me was how much of a blessing Lily would be and how much love she would spread. \n\nWe learned that to have another child that is genetically normal we have to do IVF. As each pregnancy has a 25% chance of being affected. \n\nAfter 33 days in the NICU and then the rest of her time with us at home. Which was so amazing. Each day was a joy to care for her and to love on her.\nLily passed away on July 19th 2018. Just a few days shy of her 5 month birthday. I miss her SO much. Each day is a new challenge but I am ok for the most part. \n\nSince then I have been figuring out our new normal. And a few weeks ago we started the genetic process for IVF and I learned as of this week, we are starting the big long IVF process. \n\nI'm excited, I'm scared, I'm hopeful, and I'm also pessimistic about it. I'm hoping this is a place where I can share what our journey is like.
