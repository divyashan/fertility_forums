My due date would have been 5/18/16. Last week AF finally returned and I'm now \"back to normal\" cycle wise. \n\nNow on to my post. My sister got engaged last week and asked me to be her Matron of Honor. There is no doubt in my mind that I would love to, we're super close. However, she is planning a destination wedding in Jamaica in April of 2017. \n\nThe problem? There will be no kids allowed. As of right now that's not as issue since I miscarried my first. That being said, if I had kept my pregnancy I would still have had to leave my almost 1 year old with people that were not my family (since they are all invited) for 4-5 days while I participate in her wedding. \n\nEven worse, my husband and I want to start trying again right away this month, if we get super lucky and it happens the first month, my child will be even younger when her wedding rolls around, and the further we go and it doesn't happen, the younger the baby will be or the more pregnant I will be. \n\nI'm trying not to be selfish, but at this point it feels like I have to choose between either A) leaving my baby in the states (with hopefully in-laws) for at least 3 days, B) declining to be in her wedding depending on what happens, or C) just waiting until after her wedding to have a baby (I'm already going to be 30 in 2016, so that option definitely doesn't appeal to me).\n\nAm I being unrealistic here? Do I have any right to assume she's being selfish?", "stickied": false, "subreddit": "ttcafterloss", "subreddit_id": "t5_34scd", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "A little upset with my sister, could I get your thoughts ladies?", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/ttcafterloss/comments/3xqsnk/a_little_upset_with_my_sister_could_i_get_your/"}, {"author": "tinatrying", "author_created_utc": 1382041993, "author_flair_css_class": "", "author_flair_text": "Angel Fiona stillborn 41w 2/10/15", "author_fullname": "t2_djtx6", "created_utc": 1450739460, "domain": "self.ttcafterloss", "edited": 1450739719, "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/ttcafterloss/comments/3xriem/rant_i_have_had_it_with_the_us_medical_care_system/", "gilded": 0, "id": "3xriem", "is_self": true, "locked": false, "media_embed": {}, "num_comments": 11, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/ttcafterloss/comments/3xriem/rant_i_have_had_it_with_the_us_medical_care_system/", "retrieved_on": 1454944669, "score": 18, "secure_media_embed": {}, "selftext": "So yes, I wasn't particularly thrilled when I had to pay a $3500 payment for my stillborn delivery, but I had good insurance, and we were planning on that costs for 8 months prior, so it was something I could handle, but I just have to rant on a few other people's behalfs, just to get it off of my chest.\n\nMy mom passed away October 21.  She had diabetes, kidney failure, and acute renal disease.  When I was 17, her kidney first failed.  This was in 1997.  Her insurance at the time denied her a kidney transplant saying that it was a \"lost cause\".  In essence, they did the math, and decided it would be cheaper to put her in a wheelchair and send her to dialysis 3 times a week (at $1400 per session), than to pay for her to get a new kidney.  In essence, they were betting on her to die.  For 18 years, from 1997 to this year, she went dutifully to her dialysis, worked on her diet, and tried to live the best life she could.  The cost for her surgery would have been approximately $220,000 at the time, plus $10k a month in perpetuity for to take the drugs so her system would not reject her kidney.  Instead, their dialysis plan cost them $218,400 per year.  In essence, they gambled wrong, but it still meant my mom worstened every year.  In the past 7 years, once I got further up in the workforce, I paid between $5k to $18k per year for her additional care.  For drugs her insurance wouldn't cover, or for her going beyond her \"out of pocket\" maximum.  Paying for her healthcare meant putting my life on hold as I struggled to make sure she was taken care of.  \n\nNow, my boss and good friend has been diagnosed with glioblastoma, a very rare and aggressive type of brain tumor.  There are few hospitals that will even treat it, and the ones that do are often at Universities, which insurance may or may not cover depending on how \"trial based\" the studies are.  Even though getting treatment at UCLA is the best outcome in the country (with younger patients having a 5-10% chance of living at least 10 years after diagnosis), the rest of the country is abysmal, with most insurers pushing hospitals to start \"palliative care\" regardless of the age and overall health profile (and thus potential for positive outcome) of the patient.  \n\nSo now, this wonderful person who helped make sure I had enough hours to cover my mom's end of year overage, is now sick and his choices are to \"suck it up and die gracefully\" (what his insurance wants) or take matters into his own hands and pay possibly 150k per year for treatment.  \n\nWe started a crowdfunding for him, which is going incredibly well with over 100k raised (a testament to the type of guy he is and that over 400 people have donated at this time), but there are still random troll comments that have me down where folks are saying things like, \"but doesn't he make 100k a year?  why should we help him\"...and I'm like, \"yes, he makes 100k a year, but he lives in a state with no social safety net, which meant from his first day off of work in July until now, he has made 0 money.  He is just lucky his employer is even keeping his insurance going because without them, he'd probably already be on his way to losing his house.  \n\nI just am so frustrated!  Why...why do American citizens not make this a priority.  Yes, we finally have a national candidate who is making things more known, but the mainstream media isn't willing to focus on him or this issue.  Young people are paying for the burden of the aging, our insurance is a for profit system, and the elderly or illness stricken are losing their houses, their nest eggs, and their prospects, with few seeming to give a damn.\n\nSeriously, I'm just so frustrated with people today!  \n\nEdit - I know this isn't the right place for this.  I just felt like I had to put it somewhere where people would hear me.  I also know others have it way worse.  I know other countries pay for their subsidized and socialized healthcare via taxes...I also know that doing that would be cheaper for us than our current system, but we never seem to have anyone give us real bottom line cost benefit analysis...just increased costs, but not increased savings numbers.

She lives in a tiny studio apartment (about 150 square feet) and so we all rented a huge airbnb (the kitchen alone is bigger than her studio). So, we're 6 in total and hub's family is BIG into cooking and always cook together.   \n\nWell,  his sister is pitching a fit because we aren't having Christmas in her tiny studio.  And when my guy (very calmly, might I add) points out it is too small it dissolves into a total shitfit with her accusing him of treating her horribly. This hurts me because he is *such* a sweet and kindhearted guy,  always going out of his way to be diplomatic and helpful.   \n\nWell, his mom sided with the sister  ( which has always been the family dynamic) and my guy pointed out that I, being 14 weeks,  have a sensitive nose and get easily exhausted so a multi room place is the best option.   Her compromise?  If I get tired, then I just rent a taxi and head back to the airbnb!  And when it was pointed out the taxis might not be running,  his sister pops in \"oh,  it's just a 20 minute walk!  Heide can do that!\"  \n\nGuys, I'm so hurt.  When I said I felt insulted and that it is my right if that's how I feel, my MIL said that I had no right at all because they didn't mean it as such.  I then asked her how could she feel ok with telling me to leave for a few hours on Christmas and then she yelled at me,  calling me manipulative and \"trying to make her feel guilty\". She then goes on how I'm a member of the family and it is **my** fault if I don't feel that I am.    \n\nI'm so upset. They eventually decided to stick to the original plan of having Christmas at the airbnb, but I'm so damn hurt that my MIL, FIL and SIL all thought that me leaving in the middle of Christmas and going back to the airbnb was a great idea. I can't stop thinking about it. I mean, I think it shows they don't really care if I'm there or not.  Every time I think about it, I start tearing up.

I found this sub after reading a different loss story over there.\n\nA bit of my backstory - I have a daughter who just turned two. She took us over a year to get pregnant with. We have been trying to get pregnant since she was a year old (on and off) and were extremely excited about this pregnancy, as I am nearing 35 and we had decided not to have another child unless we were pregnant by the time she turned three. My point here is that I don't get pregnant easily, so the fact that I'm most likely looking at a loss is devastating. \n\nI had an early ultrasound today to date my pregnancy. Based on my calculations, I should have been between 6w4d and 7w3d.\n\nTech gets started abdominally and can't see anything but my bladder. She has me go pee and then does transvaginal. Gets started and says \"Wow, you are SUPER early. What did you say your LMP was?\" I tell her again - which is that I started spotting for five days, then had an 8 day period.  She does the measurements without saying much, asks if I have had a c-section (yes, you could see the scar tissue) and then upon me asking, confirms that we are looking at the gestational sac. I can very clearly see that the sac is empty. She finishes and says \"I need the radiologist to look at this, can you wait a few minutes? I will come back and tell you the results.\" She comes back in, says nothing, and tells me I should call my doctor.\n\nKeep in mind, this is my second pregnancy. I know what the screen showed, and I know that a U tech can tell you the good things but not the abnormal or bad things. I looked at my husband when she left and said, there's no baby.\n\nNurse calls me afterward. Sac should be larger, there should be 'matter' in the sac by this point. She went through my chart with me and said there was a chance I was wrong on my dates, that I COULD be around 5 weeks pregnant, but that it seemed very unlikely unless I ovulated very late and the egg was fertilized on day 5 post intercourse.\n\nIn my eyes, all signs are pointing to a blighted ovum/miscarriage. This would be my first loss if that is the case. They want me to get my HCG levels taken tomorrow and to have a follow up US in 10-14 days. So on Christmas Eve, I get to have bloodwork done that won't tell me jack shit and just WAIT.\n\nThe lack of definitive result is eating me alive and is the worst part of my current situation. \n\nI've had the most ridiculous year, so many incredibly tough things have happened - including my husband having a heart attack in July at the age of 35.  Things were finally starting to get positive, I was coming out of my PPD funk (that began before I got pregnant, I've been steadily feeling better over the last two+ months) and now this.\n\nI don't know what else to say. I'm typing this as I sit next to my two year old, watching a movie with her. Trying to get excited for Christmas, hosting my entire family starting tomorrow... It just sucks, so so hard. \n\nAll I want is tacos, a hug from this little sweet pea beside me, a glass of whiskey and another good cry.", "stickied": false, "subreddit": "ttcafterloss", "subreddit_id": "t5_34scd", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Empty sac today at US (x-post from /r/BabyBumps)", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/ttcafterloss/comments/3y1jrg/empty_sac_today_at_us_xpost_from_rbabybumps/"}, {"author": "AutoModerator", "author_created_utc": 1325741068, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_text": null, "author_fullname": "t2_6l4z3", "created_utc": 1450940647, "distinguished": "moderator", "domain": "self.ttcafterloss", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/ttcafterloss/comments/3y2548/ttcafterloss_ttc_daily_discussion_thread_december/", "gilded": 0, "id": "3y2548", "is_self": true, "link_flair_css_class": "ttc", "link_flair_text": "TTC Thread", "locked": false, "media_embed": {}, "num_comments": 28, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/ttcafterloss/comments/3y2548/ttcafterloss_ttc_daily_discussion_thread_december/", "retrieved_on": 1454949699, "score": 7, "secure_media_embed": {}, "selftext": "**This thread is for members who are TTC or waiting to try.

My entire world was turned upside down that summer when we found out that Oliver was sick, and the 7 weeks we spent going back and forth and trying to do everything we could to save him were like a living hell. When I think back on that time in my life, even though it was only last year, it's all a blur and it feels like it happened to someone else, like my mind refuses to accept that something that horrible could happen to me. \n\nAfter we lost Oliver the need to try again and have a healthy baby literally consumed my every thought. I spent all my time reading about TTC and trying to imagine a happier future with a baby. But it was so, so hard to ever believe that I would actually have one. I remember constantly telling my husband that maybe I wasn't meant to be a mother, maybe Oliver was sick because I wasn't supposed to be a mom. When I saw other people get BFPs and have healthy kids I never truly believed that I would someday. \n\nI found a lot of support on the BabyCenter TFMR boards, but I knew that there had to be other people on my favorite site (Reddit :D) going through the same thing. I posted on TFAB asking if anyone would be interested in a TTC after loss sub because I couldn't handle the positivity (and na\u00efvet\u00e9) that was all over TFAB. I wanted to talk to other people who understood the complex emotions of trying again after losing a baby. So this sub was born. \n\nI had NO idea that it would become what it is now. I thought it'd be a slow, quiet sub with maybe a couple members I could commiserate with occasionally... but it's grown to be such an amazing community of people supporting each other every single day, through loss, grief, trying again, subsequent pregnancies and now the births of so many \"rainbow\" babies. \n\nEvery single step of the last year has been so difficult for me - from grieving Oliver (I still am), to trying again, to finally getting pregnant and now raising my rainbow baby, Jack. Last Christmas was by far the worst Christmas of my life. I didn't decorate, I bought all my gifts online so I wouldn't have to see babies and kids at the store, I drank my weight in wine, and I cried non-stop. I tried to imagine this Christmas would be better, but it seemed like nothing would ever be good again. \n\nBut it is good again. I'm sitting here on Christmas morning holding my second son while he sleeps. I will never forget Oliver, and I'll never fully get over the fact that he isn't here for Christmas too... but I wish I could go back and tell myself last year that things will get better, you won't feel this horrible forever and good things will happen. \n\nI feel like it's cheesy and cliche to promise you all who are just starting this journey that things will get better for you someday too - obviously  I'm not a fortune teller and I remember people telling me the same thing last year and thinking yeah right, they're full of shit. But it's true - chances are that someday things WILL be better, and you won't hurt as much, and you'll be able to smile and be happy again. \n\nI don't know where I would be without the support and love that I've received from all of you wonderful people. I think about every one of you and our lost babies everyday. I wish this community didn't *have* to exist and I wish we never had to have new members join - but I'm so happy that people starting this journey can get such great support here. \n\nAnyway I'm rambling hardcore now, but I just want to say I love all of you and I will be keeping you in my thoughts today. I hope everyone has a peaceful and happy day. \u2764\ufe0f\n\n\n", "stickied": false, "subreddit": "ttcafterloss", "subreddit_id": "t5_34scd", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "A Christmas thank you to y'all (trigger: TFMR and rainbow baby)", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/ttcafterloss/comments/3y6wg8/a_christmas_thank_you_to_yall_trigger_tfmr_and/"}, {"author": "anothermuggle", "author_created_utc": 1360158429, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_text": null, "author_fullname": "t2_ahxha", "created_utc": 1451064610, "domain": "self.ttcafterloss", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/ttcafterloss/comments/3y747m/what_can_i_do_for_my_cousin/", "gilded": 0, "id": "3y747m", "is_self": true, "locked": false, "media_embed": {}, "num_comments": 9, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/ttcafterloss/comments/3y747m/what_can_i_do_for_my_cousin/", "retrieved_on": 1454952090, "score": 7, "secure_media_embed": {}, "selftext": "My cousin lives in another country.

I just don't want any hurt feelings from family members/friends. My husband said he's fine with sharing the news whenever I am ready, but it seems like everyone shares the news with the world (Facebook, Instagram) extremely early and I would be looked at weird.

Healthy kid.\n\u200b**Jan 2014** started TTC again.  About 4 chemical pregnancies &amp; one miscarriage (7 weeks, no D&amp;C, passed on its own) over 2014.\n**Early 2015** A couple of chemical pregnancies. \n**April 2015** Ectopic pregnancy.\n**Dec 2015** Miscarriage at 15 weeks.  Had D&amp;C.\n\n I've used Clomid, Letrozole, ovulation trigger injections all to get to the point where I am.  Any other fertility treatments (IUI, IVF, etc) are out of the question due to cost.  I'm also turning 40 next month so the clock is ticking.\n\nSo obviously the Dec. miscarriage is fresh on my mind and I'm still hurting emotionally.  But my husband and I are looking ahead and really need to think about how much we really want to keep trying.  It messes with my body physically and both of us emotionally. Not just the stress of repeated failed pregnancies, but also just things like the stress of planning sex on certain days and stuff.\n\nHave any of you given up?  What brought you to that decision?  And what did \"giving up\" mean?  Like did you start using birth control (condoms, pill, IUD, something more permanent)?  Or just stop trying -- like charting your cycles and stuff, knowing you still might get pregnant sometime?  If it doesn't happen now I don't know if I want it in a few years.  So maybe I want permanent contraception. I don't know if I could handle getting pregnant at say, 45... knowing I'd be 63 when the kid is 18.  \n\nAnd lastly - is there a better place to ask these questions?

I would have been 8 weeks tomorrow with #2.\n\nWe are parents to a 2 year old daughter which was our first pregnancy. This was our second 'known' pregnancy, although from the information discussed at yesterday's appointment (with a new OB clinic, as my current clinic has been HORRIBLE to me) they firmly believe this was my second loss in a row.\n\nI'm actively miscarrying right now and have to continue with HCG testing until I'm down to zero. My last test was a 6341 on Monday the 28th. \n\nMentally, I'm still coping with this loss, especially the timing of losing a baby over the holidays, keeping that a secret from our families, and also getting news that others are due next August near what would have been my due date. I feel like I've got a lot of tears and grief ahead of me still, especially as that date approaches next summer. Facebook is suddenly a nightmare, as I'm sure many of you have experienced.\n\nAside from that, my husband and I want another child so desperately. I've never had a doctor take any of my concerns (36-43 day cycles, late ovulation, short luteal phase, Rh-, and now I've learned very low progesterone) seriously. My new doctor who I saw yesterday is FINALLY listening. I'm furious that it took a miscarriage for me to be taken seriously by medical professionals, but it is what it is at this point.\n\nMy next step is to have a full hormonal workup done by the new OB on Jan 22nd (provided that my HCG has returned to 0). We full intend to begin trying as soon as we get those results back and have a better idea what is going on with my body, so I think this sub will probably be my new home.\n\nI'm not happy to be here, but I'm glad that this place exists and I have a 'safe' space now where I can process and cope, and maybe regain a little sense of joy in time.\n", "stickied": false, "subreddit": "ttcafterloss", "subreddit_id": "t5_34scd", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Update, and my introduction of sorts (Trigger Warning, Living Child &amp; Discussion of Lab Work)", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/ttcafterloss/comments/3yynl4/update_and_my_introduction_of_sorts_trigger/"}, {"author": "AutoModerator", "author_created_utc": 1325741068, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_text": null, "author_fullname": "t2_6l4z3", "created_utc": 1451631947, "distinguished": "moderator", "domain": "self.ttcafterloss", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/ttcafterloss/comments/3yzxb6/ttcafterloss_ttc_daily_discussion_thread_january/", "gilded": 0, "id": "3yzxb6", "is_self": true, "link_flair_css_class": "ttc", "link_flair_text": "TTC Thread", "locked": false, "media_embed": {}, "num_comments": 74, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/ttcafterloss/comments/3yzxb6/ttcafterloss_ttc_daily_discussion_thread_january/", "retrieved_on": 1454965682, "score": 6, "secure_media_embed": {}, "selftext": "**This thread is for members who are TTC or waiting to try.

I was only a few weeks along (according to my records), and lost the pregnancy while I was at work.  Driving 45 minutes on the freeway to get home while the pain was happening was pretty frightening.  I made my husband stay on the phone with me during the drive in case something bad happened.  I was alone for 2 days as I bled (my husband works 48 hour shifts), and I laid in bed while everything passed on its own.\n\nNow it's been over a month of spotting and I finally got my period.  Today's the second day and it's still so heavy that I'm reminded of the miscarriage all over again.  Only my parents and my FIL know that we had a miscarriage.  My MIL has not been kind or sympathetic about how had it's been for us to ttc so we didn't want to tell her about the miscarriage.  \n\nNow I don't know what to do.  I'll be 36 this year, overweight, high blood pressure, pre diabetic, and I really need to get all those things under control before we ttc again.  I'm sad, I feel guilty, lonely, and I cry a lot.  My husband and I have argued so much lately and I know it's because we're both just so sad.  His best friend and his wife have been trying for 1 year and just announced that they were pregnant.  When they asked about us, we had to tell them that we miscarried.  Of course we had to still be excited for them, but I almost burst out in tears at least 4-5x during dinner.  \n\nI'm just rambling now, and I appreciate you taking the time to read this.  I'm sitting here alone again for 2 days as I'm bleeding, and it's stirring up a ton of emotions.

Transferred four Day 3 embryos that all looked pretty rough. Did not get pregnant.\n\nI took it pretty hard. \n\n...also my SIL let us know she was pregnant right before the transfer. She had been trying a long time, too, and she did everything right in the way she told us. That part was OK, but... \n\nWeeks went by and I was still crushed from the failed IVF. I sort of expected my husband's family to ask how I was doing, and that didn't happen. Close friends who knew didn't ask how I was doing. Relations with my own family are complicated--my dad  and his wife are the only ones I'd trust with TTC info, and I hadn't told them yet.\n\nSo after a while, and some therapy, I realized it was down to me to break that ice. And one by one I reached out to the people I trusted and let them know what was going on and that I was in pain and needed help. I had HUGE fear and resentment and unwillingness to do this, but as soon as I did it, it was like one lightswitch of pain turned off. (Other lightswitches, well...)\n\nAnyway... My SIL's baby is born now! Healthy little baby girl. And I was able to focus on my SIL and her husband and the baby when we visited at Xmas. (I had plenty of selfish *thoughts,* but I was able to *act* like I didn't.)\n\nAnyway. TTCAL was a huge comfort and support to me when I needed it most. Now I'm back for more.\n\nI switched REs last November to a new (woman) doctor I like A LOT. Got thyroid meds and vitamin D supplements (to go with the CoQ10 and DHEA.) Had a good (for me) antral follicle count and so we went forward with another IVF cycle. LOTS of shots, including Lupron and HGH, which were new for me. \n\n11 retrieved, 9 fertilized, 3 made it to day 3. Of those 3, two are 8-cell grade 1 (best) and one 5-cell.\n\nMeanwhile this doctor found enough hints of endometriosis to recommend an FET. Currently on BCPs and waiting for all 3 to be transferred sometime toward the end of February.\n\nRE believes there's a 40% chance one of the embryos is normal. So much work and waiting and $ for a 40% chance! I mean, I'm grateful to have the option of IVF--especially multiple cycles--but STILL. 2 out of 5.\n\nIf the transfer fails, the next step is (crying and video games and then) mini IVF.\n\nAnd this RE has a \"buy 2, get 1 free-ish\" IVF offer which is really, really nice.\n\nAfter that I think we're done. I mean, nobody can know until they're at that point, but I think, after 4 failed IVF cycles, I think I'd be ready to quit.\n\nThat's all I know for now. For now, the game is still on.\n\nSee y'all on the sub...", "stickied": false, "subreddit": "ttcafterloss", "subreddit_id": "t5_34scd", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "I'm back... from outer space...", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/ttcafterloss/comments/3zhr1k/im_back_from_outer_space/"}, {"author": "AutoModerator", "author_created_utc": 1325741068, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_text": null, "author_fullname": "t2_6l4z3", "created_utc": 1451977441, "distinguished": "moderator", "domain": "self.ttcafterloss", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/ttcafterloss/comments/3zj0xs/ttcafterloss_ttc_daily_discussion_thread_january/", "gilded": 0, "id": "3zj0xs", "is_self": true, "link_flair_css_class": "ttc", "link_flair_text": "TTC Thread", "locked": false, "media_embed": {}, "num_comments": 178, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/ttcafterloss/comments/3zj0xs/ttcafterloss_ttc_daily_discussion_thread_january/", "retrieved_on": 1454977342, "score": 8, "secure_media_embed": {}, "selftext": "**This thread is for members who are TTC or waiting to try.

One of the girls in this group is currently 36 weeks pregnant and will be having her baby very soon. I know that when she does go into labor or give birth she will likely send a text to all of us in this group chat and then all my other friends will be responding with their Congratulations and wanting to see pictures, etc. I am considering sending them an email in the next couple days to ask them to please keep me off of this group message as it is really upsetting to me. I should have been 30 weeks today so our babies would have been born very close together. They all know about my loss and were all very supportive immediately after I told them when it was all happening back in September. I am happy for my friend and her husband but also insanely jealous as her and her husband had a freakin unicorn pregnancy and she's never experienced a loss. Do you think it's appropriate for me to message them (minus the friend who is actually pregnant, I might message her individually) to ask them to leave me off the group chat when it's pertaining to her baby? Or should I just suck it up and receive the messages when they come and do my best to ignore it? \n\n\nETA: Let me also clarify that the friend who is pregnant has not been a friend since high school. She was roommates with my HS best friend so we met her after college, about 5 years ago. I have never been that close with her and about a year ago I moved 600 miles away and we haven't kept in touch much. So while we might see each other at other friends' weddings, we aren't close to the point of keeping in touch. (Though she did send me an edible arrangement with a note after she found out about our loss)", "stickied": false, "subreddit": "ttcafterloss", "subreddit_id": "t5_34scd", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Is this wrong of me?

Reading through your stories and comments is so validating that I am not unreasonable or unjustified in my thoughts and feelings. So thank you all for being part of this community. \n\nI figured I should introduce myself, so here goes...\n\nMy husband and I have no children and decided to start trying. I took medications for mental health and worked with my doctors to ween myself off. In May 2015, after I was off all my meds, we found out I was pregnant. I felt so lucky because it was our first time trying and my life was working as planned. I didn't think things like miscarriages would happen to me. \n\nIn July we found out we lost our baby (MMC). I was at 9 weeks and the baby measured at 7. I'm sure I don't have to elaborate on the devastation. I don't even remember most of the appointment and my husband has to fill me in on the details. \n\nI had a D&amp;C about 5 days later. That was a miserable period waiting. After the D&amp;C, I had 6 days of on and off contractions and out of control bleeding. An ER visit helped slow the bleeding, but not the contractions. It was the worst period of my life-- combined physical and emotional pain is so hard. \n\nAnyways we were advised to wait 2 cycles to try again. It took forever for AF to come again, but we are currently in our third cycle of trying. Since we were pregnant right away the first time, it is killing me that it is not happening that way this time. I know three months is not a long time, but I have been preparing for this baby since I starting weening off my medications over a year and half ago. It's so hard to want something so badly and have no control over the situation (such as crazy erratic periods that make it impossible to predict ovulation!). All without my medications. \n\nThat being said, I think I am handling things alright considering. I'm just glad that there is a place where people will understand what appears to be irrational to others. :) ", "stickied": false, "subreddit": "ttcafterloss", "subreddit_id": "t5_34scd", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Introduction", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/ttcafterloss/comments/408hbx/introduction/"}, {"author": "AutoModerator", "author_created_utc": 1325741068, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_text": null, "author_fullname": "t2_6l4z3", "created_utc": 1452409421, "distinguished": "moderator", "domain": "self.ttcafterloss", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/ttcafterloss/comments/40abd7/ttcafterloss_ttc_daily_discussion_thread_january/", "gilded": 0, "id": "40abd7", "is_self": true, "link_flair_css_class": "ttc", "link_flair_text": "TTC Thread", "locked": false, "media_embed": {}, "num_comments": 60, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/ttcafterloss/comments/40abd7/ttcafterloss_ttc_daily_discussion_thread_january/", "retrieved_on": 1454990226, "score": 7, "secure_media_embed": {}, "selftext": "**This thread is for members who are TTC or waiting to try.
