I have a call into my RE and I've already gone through the ringer with tests, so I know it's not PCOS (unless I could suddenly develop it?) \n\n\nSorry about the rant, but question is....After your loss(es) did you experience weird cycles even as far out as 5 months from your miscarriage?", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "ttcafterloss", "subreddit_id": "t5_34scd", "subreddit_subscribers": 3789, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Periods after multiple losses", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/ttcafterloss/comments/9b0gsm/periods_after_multiple_losses/"}, {"author": "AutoModerator", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_6l4z3", "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1535526741, "domain": "self.ttcafterloss", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/ttcafterloss/comments/9b71gh/ttcafterloss_ttc_daily_discussion_thread_august/", "gilded": 0, "id": "9b71gh", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 29, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/ttcafterloss/comments/9b71gh/ttcafterloss_ttc_daily_discussion_thread_august/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1535526742, "score": 3, "selftext": "**This thread is for members who are TTC or waiting to try.

It is 5 weeks since the D&amp;C, and I was told it can take 4-6 weeks for a period. My hcg on Aug 28 was 3. Previous to this, I had a 28 day, consistent cycle, with lots of ewcm for several days each time in the middle of the cycle. When I have gone off the pill in the past (4 years ago), it took several months for me to get my cycle back...and this was helped along with myo-inositol, and if I remember correctly possibly some vitex or dong quai....however I believe it was the inositol that did the trick. I have stayed on the inositol (stopped when I found I was pregnant) and started taking it again as soon as the mmc was confirmed. Basically I am worried that since hbc works by tricking your body into thinking it's pregnant, since I actually was pregnant, my period could take a while to come back without help.\n\nI am going to my naturopath today for some advice, and will see a doctor once it has been more than 6 weeks.

I am just at a loss. My little one was over 13 weeks along, and we thought we were in the clear. I am already mother to a toddler which means the OBGYN approached this pregnancy a bit more lackadaisically....or so I felt.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nEverything was going smoothly-- we were on target and I was always measuring where I should be. In our excitement, we decided to schedule the DNA free test as we couldn't wait for the gender; regardless, I am a pragmatist. On Tuesday (21st) I decided to bring out my doppler for a quick check. Our appointment was on Thursday and, this early in the pregnancy, I still had a good measure for where the heartbeat would be. Unlike my first pregnancy, I'd really only used the doppler once or twice, as it's still too early to reliably find the heartbeat.\n\nStill, there was dead silence. Nothing. Let alone the galloping heartbeat, there was no \"whooshing\" placenta sound. Immediately my heart fell to my feet. Resisting the urge to panic, I continued trying... still, nothing. My husband came home from the gym and I calmly explained to him that I had a concern with the doppler. He decides to run out at midnight for a new battery, just in case. Of course it makes no difference.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe both do our best to calm one another, but I cannot sleep; once he and the baby are down, I pull out the doppler once more. Still that fucking silence. Internally I beg and plead...please little bean. Please let me be wrong! With tears pouring down my face, I put the doppler away. I allow myself to cry in the bathroom. To mourn. I lie near my toddler, just holding his hand as he sleeps. During this time I also delete all my \"bump tracker\" apps and the like.\n\nWhen husband awakens, I let him know I think we should expect the worst. I learned from my last OBGYN that I would never again tell my doc that I use the doppler. I understand that women can be wrong, and they can panic, but I am a realist. The machine helped give me peace and comfort during my last pregnancy (anterior placenta,) where I never felt the baby move. My last OBGYN went on a tirade about dopplers and ultrasound companies, and told me they were for vanity.\n\nI feared telling the doctor I was using a doppler, in the possibility they would encourage me to stay home. At 7:30am we managed to catch a nurse on the phone and I told her I was cramping/spotting. She says I should relax and put my feet up. I thank her for the suggestion, apologize, and let her know I'd really like to come in for a heartbeat check. I've never done this. Not now and never with my last pregnancy. She says she'll see where they can squeeze me in. She checks with the doctor, this wonderful man, and he tells me to come in whenever I can. I let her know it'll be 5 minutes.\n\nOnce we're there, we're seen pretty quickly. The doctor does an internal check and verifies that the fundal height is on target, 13 weeks. He pulls out his doppler and finds nothing. This doesn't surprise me... he's been pretty shitty at finding it before.\n\nHe gives up and reiterates that I am really on target, but if I would like an ultrasound, they can schedule me in. The tech is at the main office, 20 minutes away. Is that OK? \"Yes\" husband and I say in unison. I thank him profusely and off we go. My OB managed to get us a 9 am appointment. It's 8:30 now and I am so grateful. We race to the location and we're taken in immediately. It's the same ultrasound tech who did our gestational appointment at 7 weeks... she remembers me and is a bit surprised as to why we're getting another US so quickly...she keeps talking, but I am tuning her out. I try to be polite... I think I managed to smile and make a joke. I don't fully remember.\n\nShe finally puts the wand in my stomach, and there's my baby. She/he is perfect, looks like they should, but I immediately can tell my baby has died. There is no movement, no giddy kicking like with my son. No somersaults. No bouncing. The little one floats in the amniotic fluid...drifting. It's curled up. Wrong. I look at my husband and shake my head quietly. Tears stream down our faces. My husband managed to ask, beg really, whether she could find the heartbeat. Of course she can't answer. We know this. She quickly mentions needing the doctor to check the scan... when the door shuts I apologize to my husband that we're here. I am so sorry, but this baby has passed. We're crying and holding hands. We tell each other we'll be OK as we quietly sob.\n\nThe nurse and doctor return together. The doctor just stands by while the tech shows us where the heartbeat should be. They are so kind. There are tears in the doctor's eyes, and I can see her face in front of me now. She looks deeply into my eyes and she says, \"I am so sorry.\" I tell her it's OK, out of female habit, I think. I will never forget the look on my husband's face. He looked up at the ceiling and his face was just filled with grief. Whether subconsciously or intentionally I'll never know, but he immediately took our son out of his stroller and held him. They took us to a consulting room and we began delivering the news to our immediate family.\n\nOn Thursday, instead of our DNA test, I was having my D&amp;C. At surgery I was surrounded by nurses who each apologized to me, as they read my chart. Although breaking, my heart fills with such gratitude and love when I think of these women. They shared their losses with me from 30/40 years ago and we mourned together.\n\nThis is where I am now. One week out from the D&amp;C and so eager to be pregnant again. Eager and dreading. Missed miscarriage. 13 weeks, 3 days. I find myself fluttering between sadness and acceptance. My heart breaks over again for the women who have gone through this multiple times, for the women of stillborn children. I say to myself that I will take this pain. If I accept it and move forward, will the universe spare me from future child loss? Irrational, I know.\n\nThank you for listening. I'm sorry I wrote so much-- it felt good to let it out.\n\n&amp;#x200B;", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "ttcafterloss", "subreddit_id": "t5_34scd", "subreddit_subscribers": 3805, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "New Member Story: Possible Trigger", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/ttcafterloss/comments/9bpabg/new_member_story_possible_trigger/"}, {"author": "bette-davis-thighs", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_14t7ui9s", "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1535681104, "domain": "self.ttcafterloss", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/ttcafterloss/comments/9bpn76/thank_you/", "gilded": 0, "id": "9bpn76", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_css_class": "trigger", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_template_id": "7465d7b8-7120-11e4-9568-12313d14791d", "link_flair_text": "Trigger - Early loss/CP/general losses/successes", "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 2, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/ttcafterloss/comments/9bpn76/thank_you/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1535681105, "score": 12, "selftext": "This was our first cycle TTC after a CP and we weren\u2019t successful. It feels almost just as hard as the early loss itself because I\u2019ve read many anecdotes about being extra fertile after a CP. But coming to this sub, searching for previous discussions about CPs, and reading through some of your shared experiences really helps to lighten the load and get a grip on reality right now while things feel heavy. I had a few cycle-related questions and they all were answered. \n\nSo thank you to everyone who comes here to tell their often difficult stories and ask and answer questions. It takes a lot of courage. And gauging only by the face-to-face conversations I\u2019ve had with other women, losses are more common than we think when TTC. In a society where we feel overwhelmed by pregnancy and birth announcements, and although it\u2019s painful and difficult, it\u2019s comforting to hear about the real journeys happening out there. I see you, I hear you, and I appreciate you. I currently live far away from friends and family and this sub makes me feel less alone. And I secretly wish we could end the stigma and speak freely and openly about losses the same way we talk about successes. Maybe someday. \n\nAlthough the circumstances are not always what we\u2019d hope for them to be, I\u2019m grateful for this little community.

I get my periods usually like every 35-60 days ish, but sometimes can go almost 100 days. \n\nA few years ago, I went to the gyno to see why and I was told that I didn\u2019t have PCOS (I don\u2019t have cysts on my ovaries) but was pre-diabetic. I thought I had PCOS because of my period, weight, and I definitely have more body hair than normal females. They just told me to go on BC and try to lose weight. I did get down to 160 and my periods were more normal at that point, but still not \u201cregular\u201d. I\u2019ve since gained some weight and have been less active, and they have gone back to being unpredictable. \n\nMy boyfriend and I have been TTC since May. I had a period in March and then didn\u2019t have a period until mid-June. Mid-July, I had what I thought was EWCM and we BD. Early August, I got a BFP, but I lost it a week later. I think I was only about 5 weeks. I\u2019m seeing a new gyno next week and I want to be prepared. I\u2019m happy that I know that I can get pregnant, but I\u2019m frustrated that I don\u2019t have any idea when I should be ovulating. I feel like I have absolutely no control over any of this! \n\nI\u2019m trying to eat only healthy, whole foods. I\u2019m walking every day after work and taking a prenantal, vitamin D, and fish oil. \n\nI was thinking of suggesting Metformin to my doctor? Do any of you have any other ideas of what I should do next?

My rapid FISH results came back with all cells positive for Trisomy 13. \n\nMy doctor says that, had it been a partial positive, there would be hope that my son was not affected, but a full cell positive is pretty damning. Part of me wants an amnio, fully knowing that it will tell me that my son has T13 and only prolonging the time I sit in limbo, pregnant but not expecting a child. Prolonging the time it takes me to grieve while I have to keep positive as a stay at home parent to an active, oblivious toddler. \n\nI'm furious at my doctor. He was dismissive, citing the 93% chance that my NIPT positive was false and talking optimistically about the situation. The ultrasound didn't feel thorough, and returned totally normal results, which I found through online research to be abnormal. A borderline wide NT measurement paired with a high heart rate are considered markers, but I believe he ignored them because there was such a high likelihood that all was well. He hadn't even reviewed the whole scan before telling us that everything looked normal. Only later, when given the report, did I learn about the wide NT and high heart rate, as well as the fact that they didn't even get good pictures of his head, which would offer important insight into the diagnosis. \n\nI'm angry, but also I know that my doctor was not wrong in doing a lot of what he did. I'm struggling so much to separate what stems from plain anger, and what should actually have been done differently. \n\nIn turn, it's hard for me to decide the best course of action. My gut says to get another ultrasound and look again to find abnormalities, if there are none, then get an amnio. But I'm struggling to decide whether that will help, whether I just want to see my son again and whether that will only pain me further. There is a virtually 0% chance that a full cell positive will lead to a normal amnio. But there are edge cases. Full placental mosaicism is a thing. Do I think I'm one of these edge cases? No way. But I'm afraid of terminating only to discover, or endlessly wonder whether I was. \n\nOn top of that, I know that the waiting will make my life more stressful, and in turn make my daughter's life more stressful. I'd be terminating a week before a solo international flight with a toddler. Our whole TTC plan will be shoved way back, which is petty but just an additional stress.\n\nAs of now, I have an appointment with the MFM specialist in order to discuss the diagnosis and my options, specifically further testing. I know he will advise against it. I know my husband wants to move on, so do I. Maybe I'm just afraid of letting go. Either way, I'm almost certainly joining you all.\n\n", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "ttcafterloss", "subreddit_id": "t5_34scd", "subreddit_subscribers": 3805, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Life before the loss [TFMR]", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/ttcafterloss/comments/9bvmkb/life_before_the_loss_tfmr/"}, {"author": "Cinnabunnyturtle", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_pbxkc", "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1535738067, "domain": "self.ttcafterloss", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/ttcafterloss/comments/9bvtjm/pregnancy_after_uterine_rupture/", "gilded": 0, "id": "9bvtjm", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 17, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/ttcafterloss/comments/9bvtjm/pregnancy_after_uterine_rupture/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1535738068, "score": 15, "selftext": "My uterus ruptured during an induced but otherwise normal birth.

This is my first post here ... I haven't quite caught up with all the abbreviations that are used so bear with me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI have had two miscarriages. My first pregnancy resulted in a missed miscarriage in May 2017. I was 19w3d when my midwife could not find the heartbeat with a doppler. A few anxious hours later, an emergency ultrasound confirmed our little babe no longer had a heartbeat. I fortunately had my detailed ultrasound scheduled for the very next day and we were able to get a few more details. The baby was measuring 14 weeks (which was a mere 4 days after I had heard and recorded the heartbeat). I had a D&amp;C the following day and so began my journey of constant heartache. I had some testing done to see if we could get any answers and the doctor mentioned 'her' in the mix. We hadn't planned on finding out the sex of the baby until birth; that was another hard thing to hear. However, it's nice to think of her. Our daughter was due October 21, 2017.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThat pregnancy was a surprise. A month after the loss, I landed a great job and decided to hold off on TTC until I felt more stable emotionally. We decided to start trying again in June 2018. I took two at-home pregnancy tests that both resulted in faint positive lines after our first month of trying. I tried not to get too excited, but I was entertaining the idea of our 'rainbow' baby. Unfortunately, within six days, I had quite a bit of bleeding and a blood test confirmed I was not pregnant. This miscarriage was at just over 5 weeks.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo here I am ... one missed miscarriage, one miscarriage, and I did not get pregnant while TTC over this past month. And I'm just confused. I feel confused by my body. In my first pregnancy, my body held on for 5 weeks longer than the baby was alive, and in my second pregnancy, it barely held on for a week that I knew of the pregnancy. I just don't know what it is going to be like for me when I carry a baby, if I ever do. It's just so hard.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThankfully, I have the most supportive husband - however, this has definitely impacted me more negatively than it has him. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAre there any resources (articles, podcasts, books) that you can suggest that really helped you? I did go to a few counselling sessions with the first loss. I mainly was opposed to continuing based on finances, but it is something I reasonably can afford if I so choose.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI appreciate you taking the time to read my long post.\n\n&amp;#x200B;", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "ttcafterloss", "subreddit_id": "t5_34scd", "subreddit_subscribers": 3801, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Scared it won't ever happen ..", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/ttcafterloss/comments/9c0jpo/scared_it_wont_ever_happen/"}, {"author": "yoooooohoooooooooooo", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_ks1it", "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1535785014, "domain": "self.ttcafterloss", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/ttcafterloss/comments/9c14ku/question_for_those_who_have_had_to_tfmr_trisomy/", "gilded": 0, "id": "9c14ku", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 33, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/ttcafterloss/comments/9c14ku/question_for_those_who_have_had_to_tfmr_trisomy/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1535785015, "score": 13, "selftext": "I just got the call yesterday that my baby was positive for Trisomy 18. Knowing that's a pretty significant diagnosis, I have been reading everything I can get my hands on and spent almost the entire day with specialists and my OB. Here's what I know. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\- I am 11w 3d based on dating scan, 12w based on LMP.  Baby seems to be developing at a normal rate.\n\n\\- Ultrasound at 10w was overwhelmingly positive. Baby was dancing around, my doctor even played some music and toggled the screen to make baby dance to the music. Heartbeat around 168.\n\n\\- The Panorama test came back positive for Trisomy 18. Based on my maternal age (34) and the efficacy of the test, that's a 35% chance that it's a true positive. \n\n\\- I went for an ultrasound today with a MFM and the findings were: NT of 4.8 and thickened abdominal areas called Anasarca. These two things combined is called Hydrops Fetalis. Heartbeat at 167 and lots of bouncing around.\n\n\\- Anasarca/Hydrops Fetalis is one of the markers for Trisomy 18 and is considered very serious/terminal as well. About 20% of babies with this condition make it to term. Most are extremely ill at birth.\n\n\\- I chose not to get the CVS today as the MFM doctor was basically 100% certain that what he saw on the scan combined with the Panorama results were confirming a diagnosis. \n\n\\- I talked with my OB and he told me he would do the CVS, if it were him, just to be 1000 percent sure. He also told me that a D+C or a D+E would be much easier at 11w than it would be at 15 to wait for a CVS, the results, and possibly an amniocentesis. \n\n\\- Since the heartbeat is strong and the fluid build up isn't in the heart yet, it likely will not naturally miscarry for some time. Could be many weeks - could go full term. There's no real way to know. \n\n\\- This \\[study\\]([https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20925041](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20925041)) determined Ultrasound was the most effective way to diagnose Trisomy 18. At &lt;14 weeks, the results are 92.7% correct in diagnosing the abnormality. That, coupled with my 35% risk from the Panorama test, they say it is almost a certainty.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy questions... \n\n\\- Has anyone ever had anasarca on an ultrasound and have it be a fluke?\n\n\\- Has anyone ever had a thickened NT on an ultrasound and have it be a fluke? \n\n\\- Has anyone had these combined diagnostics and have it be a fluke? (Positive blood test, NT thickened, and Anasarca)\n\n\\- How do you become 100% certain that you want to TFMR? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI think I have hope because of the high heart rate, normal fetal size, and the amazing amount of movement - and something inside of me just saying everything is ok and to wait it out. But everything they're telling me is pretty damming. I think I'm going to opt for the CVS on Tuesday (damn holiday weekend!!)  and see what they have to say. If they come back with bad news, I will proceed with termination. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTo say I'm devastated is an understatement. I absolutely don't want to have to make this decision and am heartbroken, to say the least. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThank you for your thoughts and words of wisdom.

We lost our baby at 14 weeks after being told heartbeat was gone around 9 (yes my doctor was awful). The week culminated in an emergency D&amp;C and left my partner and I reeling. The months that followed were hard to say the least. Now, we have finally decided we would like to try again but I am so incredibly scared. I never want to feel like I did after losing our love again. So, for starters I am looking for some advice on how to mentally prepare myself and not obsess over every detail. Anything would help.\n\nSecondly, I have some questions I'm hoping some more experienced women can help me with. I went back on the BCP for 6 months after loss. I had a normal period (Aug 2-6), then started my new pack (Tues Aug 7). I took Tuesday-Friday (4 pills) until partner and I had a talk and decided we were done with the pill and wanted to \"get back out there\". Today, it is Sept 3 and according to my app I'm 4 days late. Now, I need to know if this is because of stopping the pill mid pack or for other reasons. I have stopped before and simply gotten my period but this time not even any spotting. I've had a few cramps that I thought would result in bleeding and nothing. Now, my nipples are feeling extremely sensitive. As a side note, with or without the pill I have always had a regular 28 day cycle. I dont want to overreact because I realize this is most likely because of the pill but it's hard to chalk it up to that when my nerves about getting pregnant are so present. Can anyone give me some insight on this? I know we are all different in our cycles and bodies but the longer I go without a period the more anxious I get.

I cannot imagine going through another pregnancy, dreading every appointment, fighting every \"bad feeling\" I have, tip toe-ing around all foods, missing out on swimming and physical activity and doing countless searches to make sure the prenatal I'm taking is the best, plus extra folic and iron and Vit. D. just to end up with empty arms and a broken heart. Again. \n\nSo finally, back my question, how do you brave ladies who've been through subsequent losses, or multiple losses keep going?

Although it was hard after both, I was having a really hard time dealing after my second loss. My OB suggested counseling- at first I didn't think it was for me, but then my SIL (who went through some different fertility issues) told me that she had gone and it really helped her. I found a practice that is focused on dealing with women who have fertility issues, have suffered pregnancy losses, and focus on other pregnancy and newborn-related issues along with family. \n\nFirst and foremost- if you are struggling, I highly suggest going to counseling. It's not a magical solution to your problems, but is there to help you find the tools to better understand/cope with/deal with what is going on. \n\nOk here's the best tool my counselor has given me. One of the things I was most struggling with  was feeing very alone and isolated because I couldn't verbalize how I was feeling. The depths of sorrow and pain and awfulness I was feeling just couldn't be put into words in a way that I felt I could adequately explain how I was feeling so that people could understand what I was feeling and why I was so bad. After we established that I was, indeed, sureounded by a wonderful husband, and family, and friends who would be there for me if I asked, and I explained the above, my counselor hit me with the Big One. \n\n\"Tell me more about this feeling that you're having that you need to explain yourself and your feelings to people. Why can't you just tell them that you feel like absolute shit, and that you need them to just sit there quietly and let you cry or let you talk, not giving affirmations, but just be there with you?\"\n\nI was blown away by that. That was literally never an option for me, because I just hadn't thought of trying it. \n\nLiterally that night I used those words with my husband, and within the next couple days with my closest friend. It was huge. It was hard. But wow, was it wonderful to say and immediately get my point across without worrying about their comprehension of my feelings. \n\nIt hasn't made the pain go away, it won't bring my babes back, but it has made it possible to feel supported and not feel so alone. \n\nI know everyone's experience is different, and that you may not be having the same hard time with asking for support as me, but if this can help any one of you as much as it has helped me, then please, take this and use it. \n\nContinue to take the time you need to love yourselves, whether that be a couple months, a couple days, or a couple years. Ask for help if you need it- don't let words get in the way. \n\nBest,\nS", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "ttcafterloss", "subreddit_id": "t5_34scd", "subreddit_subscribers": 3805, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "I learned something Profound at counseling", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/ttcafterloss/comments/9d0oow/i_learned_something_profound_at_counseling/"}, {"author": "Loralora", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_pfice", "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1536115699, "domain": "imgur.com", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/ttcafterloss/comments/9d2bru/tattoo_to_honour_my_stillborn_baby_and_living/", "gilded": 0, "id": "9d2bru", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_self": false, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 1, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/ttcafterloss/comments/9d2bru/tattoo_to_honour_my_stillborn_baby_and_living/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1536115700, "score": 1, "selftext": "", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "ttcafterloss", "subreddit_id": "t5_34scd", "subreddit_subscribers": 3807, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "default", "title": "Tattoo to honour my stillborn baby and living child", "url": "https://imgur.com/LTyEUFi"}, {"author": "Aridedede", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_62tj2sp", "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1536122952, "domain": "self.ttcafterloss", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/ttcafterloss/comments/9d35im/ayurvedic_herbs/", "gilded": 0, "id": "9d35im", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 2, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/ttcafterloss/comments/9d35im/ayurvedic_herbs/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1536122953, "score": 1, "selftext": "Anyone tried?

I normally post things like this in the daily chats, but I figured this would turn into a wall of text, so I just thought it would be simpler to turn this into a separate post. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nToday I stood up for myself. \n\nI have a problem with confrontation. It takes up a lot of emotional energy, so I avoid things that might be awkward or make me feel like I'm burdening someone else. It means I stay quiet a lot. Even when I know the end result will make me uncomfortable. \n\nNow, don't get me wrong, I can argue for myself and my wellbeing with my husband (even though he's not much of an issue anyway), and I've been very good about vocalizing my needs and feelings post-loss, post-trying again, and through this process of trying again. But, with other people I feel the need to hold back. I just don't feel like my needs are more important than the needs of others. \n\nI do try to take care of myself the best way I know how. I work out, I get my nails done, I eat well, and I participate in a responsible amount of retail therapy (along with actual therapy). But working out has been my biggest sanctuary in these past few months. I recently started going to a Friday women's yoga class, and I've become incredibly fond of it. It's a super gentle practice, and my time to connect back with my body and forgive myself for everything that's been going on. This brings me to today. \n\nAt the beginning of my women's yoga class, the instructor let us know that a member of the class (who had given birth right before I started going), had emailed her asking if she could come back and bring her baby. She opened this up to the class so we could give our opinions on whether or not this would be distracting or something we would be okay with. One of the women who's been in this class for a few years said she, personally, wouldn't mind. Another women commented that she comes to this class to get some time away from her kids, and that it would be distracting for her. \n\nIn my heart, I knew I wouldn't be okay with this. I'm trying really hard to accept that other pregnant women and newborns are a part of life, and even though I didn't get to become a mom this summer, other women did. I know it's normal in our circumstances, and I completely understand it, but I don't want to get to a place where I become resentful of other pregnant women and new moms. I accept they are a part of life, but I'm not ready to deal with a newborn in my yoga class when I'm trying to find peace in the fact that I don't have one of my own and I should. \n\nI wasn't ready to voice this concern with the entire class, but by the end of it, I worked up the nerve to tell the instructor privately. I told her that I understood this woman is looking for support and community in a time that can be really isolating, but that I'm working through a miscarriage and having more trouble than I expected trying again. I told her that, though I know I'm coming from a place of selfishness, this is my space for dealing with the hurt that's come with my shit, and a newborn in the class would be a little overwhelming for me. She was super understanding and told me she completely respected my opinion, then gave me a hug.\n\nAfter I got home, I realized that even if that woman comes to class with her baby, I'd be okay because at least I spoke up for myself. Actually addressing my needs is a huge amount of growth for me. It's not that I need my Friday yoga class to remain my safe space, I just need to know that I'm heard. \n\nI thought pregnancy and motherhood would be a tremendous opportunity for personal growth, and when I miscarried it made me feel so stuck. I guess I'm growing anyway, even though it's not in the way I wanted, and I'm really proud of myself for that. \n\nTL;DR: I voiced my needs today, and then I came home and cried because sometimes we get to grow in ways we don't know we need.

The last time I had it colored and cut was about a week before I found out about my MMC. I\u2019ve tried to make the appointment ten times but finally gritted my teeth and made it last week. I\u2019m a real estate agent, so I can\u2019t be walking around with roots and Lady Godiva hair, which has been my current look for a couple of months now, because I\u2019m sad and couldn\u2019t bear the thought of cutting off my pregnancy hair. Which I haven\u2019t really verbalized to anyone, and is probably crazy, but I know y\u2019all will understand. My hairstylist is an absolute saint. I\u2019ve used her for about seven years now exclusively, she owns her own small salon and is a couple of years older than me so we\u2019ve spent a lot of our twenties together. She did my hair for my wedding, she cuts my husband\u2019s hair, my dad\u2019s hair, and my sister\u2019s hair. I knew she knew, because with that many people adjacent to me seeing her, and because she\u2019s so kind, I know she would\u2019ve asked them about me/how my pregnancy was coming. I walked in and it was just the two of us and I immediately burst into tears and I couldn\u2019t help it, it was like floodgates. I vaguely gestured at my head and was like \u201cPlease, just do something with this. I\u2019m all fucked up and sad and I\u2019m having a hard time letting go of my pregnancy hair,\u201d and the she just hugged me and immediately said \u201cThen we won\u2019t cut it.\u201d She sat me in the chair and took the reins while I cried. And I apologized for crying and she told me absolutely to not apologize and she just made me feel okay about feeling my feelings. For the past three hours I\u2019ve sobbed off and on and she coaxed me through it, made me feel like a human again, made me laugh, and I don\u2019t know why I\u2019m posting except to tell you guys who are struggling like I am that there are still good people out there who will understand and help you if you let them and tell them you need help. I\u2019m a pretty together person most days but I don\u2019t know, something about getting my hair done was a really big hang-up, something I\u2019ve been dreading even more than my dude date coming up and today\u2019s six month mark, and I survived! I cried a whole lot and luckily I had someone who absolutely held my hand every step of the way. We trimmed a little, just the dead ends, but I\u2019ve got fresh color and body to my head and I feel like me again for the first time in a long time. Self-care has been really hard because it means confronting head-on what I need even if that means what I need will hurt, so today I took a big step in the right direction, and I feel better for it.

Your reproductive endocrinologist may not read urology reproductive medicine journals and up to date articles and think ICSI and PGS can solve things with IVF when that\u2019s really far the truth and you will likely have poor blasts and miscarriages with PGS normal embryos. \n\nMake sure that after 2 miscarriages when you start RPL work up your husband goes to a reproductive urologist who is up to date on these issues and gets a Sperm analysis, DNA fragmentation, karyotype and genetic testing. \n\nSperm analysis and dna fragmentation are to be done together. One without the other tells very little information on how fertile or infertile your male partner actually is. The sub I made has all the information, studies and how male sperm is responsible for 50% of issues we deal with every day.

This is early compared to a lot of you on here, and I can't imagine the grief that some of you must feel given how devastated I was after only \"knowing\" and loving my baby for 5 weeks. I hope none of us ever have to know that grief again.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI know this question gets asked a lot, but my husband and I are hoping to start trying again as soon as is physically healthy (even if that means not waiting for a period) and we're wondering about whether there's any correlation with how early the pregnancy ends and how quickly my body can heal enough to support a future pregnancy. Does anyone have links to studies, or anecdotes about personal experiences? My loss is so new but I'm grasping at anything that can help me make sense of things and move forward.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm so thankful to have this community of resilient and supportive women- again, I'm new here so if there's a better place/weekly thread or something where I should be posting this, please let me know.

I\u2019m lying in bed feeling sorry for myself. I was just thinking about my monthly bumper group and how sad it makes me that I\u2019m not there anymore. They\u2019re all going on and will get their babies... and I don\u2019t. My baby is sitting in an urn on my mantle. It fills me with this weird panic feeling, knowing that they\u2019re getting to experience all the things I wanted to experience. They\u2019re feeling the kicks and the hiccups, watching their bellies grow, starting to make plans, finishing their nurseries, taking hospital tours, doing birthing classes, going shopping, planning baby showers, dealing with annoying people wanting to touch them... I could go on. I\u2019m so happy for them but I\u2019m also so. fucking. angry. I feel like my life has just been ripped from me, my world will never be the same, and yet it continues on for everyone else just like it\u2019s supposed to. I feel totally broken and like there\u2019s no coming back from this. I feel trapped in a totally miserable and helpless situation. No matter which way things go, I\u2019m fucked.\n\nSome of you know my story better and I have written about it so many times. I\u2019m on medical leave until October because I needed time to heal after my TFMR. I\u2019m getting paid. But I don\u2019t want to go back to work because I hate teaching; every year toward the end of the first semester, I start thinking I should check myself into the hospital for my depression because I think about crashing my car into a tree in my way to work every day. I know that\u2019s coming for me again. I know I\u2019m already there now. I don\u2019t want to go back, but I have to because I have bills and I need insurance. My husband is going back to school to finish his degree so he can only work part time, but he doesn\u2019t have a job yet, but he\u2019s coming to the end of his unemployment. We would be so screwed if I got pregnant again right now. If I found a new job, I wouldn\u2019t get FMLA. I also can\u2019t take something that will be a massive pay cut or with worse benefits. I am just feeling so much pressure from all sides and I feel like I\u2019m being crushed. I hate my life and I want out, or at least to be able to just skip to the part where I don\u2019t want to just be swallowed up in my bed.\n\nI know it makes more sense for my husband and I to start trying later, when our financial and career issues are at least closer to being sorted, but I can\u2019t help but want to be pregnant again now. We would likely be way more stressed. How can I know that it\u2019s logistically better to wait and yet still be devastated by it? I am so frustrated by how everything that\u2019s happened has screwed everything else up in our lives and I just can\u2019t deal.", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "ttcafterloss", "subreddit_id": "t5_34scd", "subreddit_subscribers": 3831, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Feeling sorry for myself and just want to vent", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/ttcafterloss/comments/9effmv/feeling_sorry_for_myself_and_just_want_to_vent/"}]}
