And this may be long. I've never told anyone this before (aside from my husband) and I think it's time I get it off my chest. If you get through this, thank you for your time.\n\nI was 19 (21 now). It will be three years in September since my miscarriage. I was a freshman at a huge, Big 10 university and I was living in the dorms. I was surrounded by strangers, two hours from home and from my boyfriend (who is now my husband). I had only been there for two weeks.\n\nI had been bleeding for an entire MONTH. I've always had irregular periods. I would skip them, or have some that lasted for two weeks. I had never had one for a month but I was willing to pass it off as such. The week before I moved into my dorm, the bleeding stopped. A week later, it started up again just as heavy and lasted two more weeks. \n\nIt was two in the morning when I woke up with only one thought in my mind - I had to get to a restroom, and fast. When I did, it was like my insides were falling out and there was so much pain (I should note that I also NEVER had cramps before, either, and I had had a period for nine years up to this point). \n\nI reached down there and I shouldn't have. Maybe I wouldn't have figured out what was happening. I would have just passed it off as some crazy period and never thought of it again. But I didn't. Here's where it gets a little graphic.\n\nI pulled something out of me. It was the sac. To be honest my first thought was \"are my organs falling out??\" But I knew what was happening. There were large clots in the toilet on top of the sac (looking at pictures of what it was was enough to concern my fears). I had lost a baby. My baby. My baby that I hadn't even known was growing inside of me. \n\nWhen I finally got the courage to go to the doctor (which was simply a nurse at the health center at the school, I had no insurance) she told me that I hadn't had a miscarriage. My pee sample was negative. She continued to deny it when I told her what I had seen, what I had held and touched, what I had flushed down the toilet when I had no idea what to do while crying in the bathroom, covered in blood. I had been bleeding for six weeks. Of course the test was negative. She said, no, it's just an irregular period. Here's some birth control. No comment on the large sac I pulled out of my body or the significant amount of blood that I lost that somehow didn't affect me?\n\nAt first, I was okay, if only a little angry at that woman. I couldn't have a baby, I was going to school and I had only been with my husband for a short time, who knew if we would last the long distance?\n\nI didn't stay in that school. I got depressed (I never associated it with the miscarriage, but looking back, I know that's what it was). I moved in with my boyfriend and commuted to another university closer to home. I wasn't happy then, either. \n\nI had a scare. I thought I was pregnant, and then experienced the same pain and bleeding (for two weeks only this time) but I don't believe it was a miscarriage. Just the fear. But it led me to this dream (TMI).\n\nA baby, deformed and bloody. Another coming out of its chest, screaming. I ran, I was throwing up. And then I was holding this perfect little boy. He looked just like my husband but he had my blue eyes. He put his tiny hands on my cheeks and smiled at me. I fell in love and then I woke up.\n\nTwo and a half years later, I am ready to have a baby. The baby in my dream (I know that's a stretch, right, but I can't help it). Since then, my friends, my family, they are ALL having children. I want to be happy for them but it breaks my heart and I smile for them but I cry when I'm alone. It's caused depression and anxiety and I can hardly cope sometimes, always imagining I'm pregnant. \n\nI'm ready to try now. My husband is more difficult to convince but it feels like he never understands. My soul is calling out for my baby.\n\nI'm sorry for this long rant, but It truly feels amazing to finally tell someone.", "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "ttcafterloss", "subreddit_id": "t5_34scd", "suggested_sort": null, "thumbnail": "self", "title": "I'm Ready to Try (&amp;My Untold Miscarriage Story)", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/ttcafterloss/comments/5xb69e/im_ready_to_try_my_untold_miscarriage_story/"}, {"author": "nhamade", "author_created_utc": 1485372579, "author_flair_css_class": "", "author_flair_text": "Riyad: stillborn at 38 weeks 11-4-16", "author_fullname": "t2_14rvgq", "brand_safe": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1488566863, "domain": "self.ttcafterloss", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/ttcafterloss/comments/5xc65w/i_hate_periods_tw_stillbirth/", "gilded": 0, "id": "5xc65w", "is_self": true, "locked": false, "media_embed": {}, "num_comments": 29, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/ttcafterloss/comments/5xc65w/i_hate_periods_tw_stillbirth/", "retrieved_on": 1492372621, "score": 16, "secure_media_embed": {}, "selftext": "Today is the first month after my full term stillbirth that we decided to start trying. 4 days late, and no period.

We are high school sweethearts, each other's best friends for what seems like forever, and the only one each other has been with so we are very much in tune with each other's feelings, wants, and needs. She is a NICU nurse with a great heart and a fierce love for animals. She does struggle with confidence (if only she saw what I see.. but that's another topic) and anxiety pretty badly (genetic). We will have been married for six years in June and the last year has been easily our most difficult. We have miscarried twice since July and quite honestly it had been damn hard on us both. We have cried together, argued, and just struggled with life. She has gone from being her happy self to person who just doesn't expect anything good from life. She is changed as anyone would be. Please don't mistake this for complaining about her. She is my world and our marriage has only gotten stronger over the last few months. Even our sex life has improved which I honestly expected would dwindle to nothing. We are more intimate with each other (sexually and not) and have relied on each other more and more. I say this to show how this has changed us. \n\nOur story:\nShe stopped taking birth control back in April of last year and we were pregnant by the end of June. We were ecstatic. We had waited until we both had jobs that would financially allow us to do anything we needed to do for our baby and while the waiting was difficult (wife had baby fever for years but was in nursing school so it wasn't reasonable for us), our time was finally here. We called her doctor and got our first appointment scheduled for when we would be about 8 weeks. \nThe next couple of weeks were uneventful. Minimal symptoms on her end which concerned her (my wife is very much a worrier. She expects the worst to happen in almost any situation so I usually end up having to be the optimist and try to keep her mindset as positive as possible.) Anyways, minimal symptoms, so she is a nervous wreck thinking something is wrong, that she should be sick or nauseous or something. I try to convince her that maybe she is just a lucky one that doesn't have to experience those symptoms or maybe that they will come once we are further along. \nAppointment day hits and we go to the doctor together. She is very nervous to the point of almost being sick whereas I am happy and eager to get her mind at ease. We are called back to the ultrasound room and judging from dates we should be 8 weeks give or take a few days so a heartbeat should be detectable. Excitement builds.\n\nAnd then that terrible image comes up. \n\nThe gestational sac was there but it was empty. My wife being a nurse (NICU nurse at that) knew immediately what it meant. Dumb husband over here didn't know what was going on at first but from my wife's face I figured it out pretty quickly. We were taken to a room after she got dressed and she lost it. I was alternating between holding her and getting tissues for her all the while I am just stunned. It had never occurred to me that we might not get a baby out of a pregnancy. \nDoctor came in and we talked about the possibilities it could be. Miscarriage, ectopic, or really early. I freaked out internally at the word ectopic cause i knew that could be really serious surgery and could affect her long term. I made myself sick over the next few days worrying about that so I never really grieved the miscarriage like my wife did. Thankfully that didn't happen. We got levels checked for a few days, confirmed the miscarriage, and had a D&amp;C done with no complications. We both struggled with the emotional roller coaster in the next couple of months; grief, anger, jealousy, depression, fear, repeat. I basically played the parts of emotional support for her during recovery and let her vent when she needed it all the while dealing with my feelings when not with her.\nFast forward to October. Wife has recovered physically from surgery and we have been given the green light to try again. We both agree that it's best to try again right away (every new pregnancy announcement is like a dagger that starts the cycle over again so we need our own to get back to normal). We get pregnant right away and with alot of nerves and fear have our first appointment right before Thanksgiving.\nA few days before our appointment, my wife starts bleeding. Not heavy but still very concerning. Panicked, she calls the doctor and we get in a day sooner. Ultrasound shows one sac and a second spot that could be a second sac or blood. At this point we were between 4 and 5 weeks so nothing was visible. They pull her numbers and say nothing looks alarming at this point. When we go to the original appointment a few days later, the Ultrasound looks the same and her levels have barely gone up. \n\nAnother miscarriage. \n\n(TMI warning) Doctor prescribes a medicine to make her miscarry at home (didn't want to do another D&amp;C so close and risk her developing scar tissue). That was horrible. She started bleeding about Thanksgiving and it didn't quit for a few weeks. Every time she went to the bathroom there were bits of tissue which was heartbreaking to watch so I can only imagine how badly it must have hurt feeling it as well. This one was much more emotionally trying because of that. \n\nWe went to see a specialist in December to get a plan and run some tests to try and determine a cause. All genetics screens on both of us were normal, her clotting factors and physiology (uterus, ovaries, tubes, etc.) were normal. The only thing off was here TSH level. For a normal person who is not pregnant, below 4.0 is normal. Hers is 3.5 so it's fine for a normal person. For a pregnant person the level needs to be below 2.5 however. Anything above that raises the miscarriage rate drastically (basically seems like the odds of a miscarriage are about 2/3s of the time if the level is above 2.5). So I think we have a cause but she doesn't see it that way (grief is blinding her to it I think). \n\nWe go to have her level checked again tomorrow and if it is below 2.5 we will have the green light again which would mean we could conceive again right after our first would have been due (March 24). We are both as emotionally ready to have another go as we can be and have had good talks about how fun a Christmas baby would be so I really hope this works out as she needs something to be happy about again. \n\nAll of that to ask this, ladies who have had multiple losses is there any advice you can provide that can help me keep her spirits up and keep her from worrying and stressing more than she already will? What did your SO do for you that really helped during your next pregnancy? What was the hardest part of being pregnant again?\n\nTL:DR - Two miscarriages in six months, may can try again this month, read the last paragraph at least..", "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "ttcafterloss", "subreddit_id": "t5_34scd", "suggested_sort": null, "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Wife and I are about to try for a baby again after 2 miscarriages in the last year.

I'm hesitant on going to a RE just yet, and was sort of hoping to return to TTC and give this one more go.\n\nBut I dunno. I just feel... let down. Any advice going forward?

This is my first post here and I'm not even sure what I'm hoping to gain from this post but I need to vent and what better place to vent than a community with other women that have been dealt similar difficult hands in life. I will preface this by saying prior to my positive at home pregnancy test I had no pregnancy symptoms and I hadn't even \"missed a period\". We later found out the bleeding I was experiencing was not menstruation but rather bleeding due to the pregnancy being ectopic. We only picked up a test from the store because strange signs kept surfacing. Such as a full carton of double yolked eggs, a coworker telling me she had a dream I had a baby and of course the sign that really pushed us over the edge.. a pregnancy test in the checkout line that someone had ditched last minute. I took a test Monday morning (February 6) that came up positive within seconds. I then took two more tests that day just to be sure - all positive as well. This was my first pregnancy and while I was in a happy and committed relationship it still came as quite a shock to us both. We were excited of course but definitely a little freaked out as well. I called the following morning to schedule a prenatal and ultrasound appointment which was set for February 28th. Thursday morning (February 9) I woke up to blood. We were devastated. I called the OB and they told me that I was probably miscarrying and that there wasn't really anything to be done. They suggested I come in for blood work that afternoon and then again 48 hours later so they could compare my hcG levels. On Monday they called me with my results.. hcG levels were 3200 on Thursday and 4500 on Saturday. Because my levels were still increasing, although slowly, they said my pregnancy was continuing and asked me to come in for an ultrasound the next day. I will admit that prior to that ultrasound I had never even heard of an ectopic pregnancy. During the ultrasound the screen was turned away from me so all I could do was watch the technicians face. After like 10 minutes (which seemed like forever) she started asking questions like \"How far along did you say you were?\" and \"Are you having any pain on either side of your abdomen?\" So I realized something was off pretty quickly. After the ultrasound I met with the Dr. who broke the news that the pregnancy was ectopic, I was somewhere between 6 - 8 weeks pregnant and the pregnancy was located in my left tube. They said my levels were just below the cutoff for using Methotrexate as treatment. I was given the shot 15 minutes later before I even really had a chance to understand what was going on. After the first shot I didn't have really any physical side effects other than some fatigue and very light cramping. Fast forward a few days when I started to experience pretty intense abdominal pain so I called the Dr. and they suggested I get to the emergency room immediately. I had another ultrasound in the emergency room which revealed the Methotrexate shot \"didn't take\" which meant the pregnancy was continuing. At that point my levels had gone from 4500 my previous blood draw to around 10000. They suggested we try the Methotrexate shot one more time before going the surgery route because I am so young (26) and they didn't want to risk me losing my tube during surgery. I was administered another dose of Methotrexate in the ER and sent home a few hours later. The next morning I woke up feeling like I was run over by a semi 50 times. Everything hurt - I had a full blown migraine and spent the next 24 hours in the bathroom with activity on both ends of my body. (TMI???) Five days later I began spotting which turned into light bleeding for approx 5 days. A few days later I had a follow up with my OB to check my hcG levels to see if they were beginning to come down and thankfully they were. They dropped from 10000 to 4600 so the Dr. said we will just do weekly blood draws to ensure the levels continue to decrease. Last Thursday I had blood work again which showed my levels had decreased to 680 which is obviously a significant decrease in just a week. Now onto my current concerns.. As of Saturday evening I have had very intense cramping in my lower left abdomen and shooting pains in my rectum that literally leave me gasping and crying out when they occur. I called the Dr yesterday morning and was told it could be any number of things but the soonest they could see me is Wednesday however if the pain becomes unbearable that I should head to the ER without hesitation. I guess I am wondering if anyone else has experienced anything similar as their levels got low? During this ordeal I shut down emotionally and became very angry, cold, distant and essentially unreachable. Just seeing pregnant women made me so furious. I understand that the baby inside me was just as much mine as it was my partners but I couldn't help but feel like I was alone in the situation even though he was very supportive and loving to me through the whole thing and always reassured me that we could start actively trying to conceive once the Dr gave us the green light. Unfortunately our relationship did not survive this hardship and I am simultaneously trying to grieve the loss of a baby and the loss of my relationship. I'm just so tired.

My period last month was almost a week late, and a little lighter than usual, but post-d&amp;c everything was kinda weird anyway, and HPTs were all negative. Then, a couple weeks ago, my dog died. I can't really find the words to express how devastated I feel. She was my little shadow, and the only constant in my life for the last 12 years - she saw me graduate college, move cross country, suffer through grad school, get my degree, get married, move again, start my career, have one baby, lose another baby. She was always, always at my side, and now she's gone. \n\nThen, this weekend happened. We were on our way to go skiing when I started to have excruciating stomach pain. I pulled over to let my husband drive, and found the nearest emergency room on google maps (we were 2.5h away from home by then). By the time we arrived, I was shaking and sweating and felt on the verge of passing out. Apparently those HPTs were wrong, and that bleeding wasn't my period. I had an ectopic pregnancy and there was a bunch of blood in my abdomen. I was admitted and the next morning, the on-call OB removed my Fallopian tube. We weren't released until the following afternoon, and after a painful drive back, I was finally able to rest at home. I'm supposed to see my normal OB tomorrow to catch him up. \n\nI feel like I should be sad, but all I feel is numb. It's like I've already reached sadness saturation. Numb, and like maybe a second baby is just too much to ask from my body.

It's been a while since I've posted on Reddit, let alone this sub so here's some backstory:  my DH and I found out we were pregnant last August after 15 months of TTC and we were elated. After a slow heart rate at our first appt, we learned the next week that we had a MMC. I ended up having a D&amp;C two days before our 4th wedding anniversary. The next week, we had to put our dog to sleep the day after my DH's birthday. He had been by my side for 8 years and we were still grieving the loss of our other dog 10 months before. We had finally decided to start TTC at the new year, however my best friend became extremely ill and passed away last month. I just feel like I've lost so much and just don't know what to do. We gave our best effort this cycle because I know my friend would want me to carry on but ended up with a BFN. I just don't know how much I can take. Dealing with this much loss on my own is rather overwhelming some days. I suffer from depression but have gone off my medication for the past two years in order to conceive. And now I don't have the one other person I always leaned on through our TTC troubles. I guess I just needed to vent. I'm turning 34 in a few months and DH will be 39 after that. I feel like I'm getting too old to be able to start a family as we want more than one child. Thanks for listening.

I walked around excited, telling everyone, because at 15 weeks, I was safe. \n\nAt 10 weeks, finding out I was pregnant with twins, but 1 had no heartbeat and a large cystic hygroma. I dealt with that, and still remained positive for the health of the other baby. I sat for weeks waiting for the NIPT results, even after finding out they messed up and had to rerun it. Genetics came back great. Baby looked great on the 12 week ultrasound. \n\nI heard her heartbeat with my home doppler just 2 days ago.\n\nThere were no symptoms, no bleeding, no cramping. I still had all my pregnancy symptoms. But somehow I just knew. Something felt different. Before my doctor appointment, I broke out the home doppler to reassure myself and my husband. No heartbeat.\n\nDrive to the OB office, Dr tries to reassure me I'm not trained on doppler and baby is fine. His face changes when he can't find the heartbeat. We head to the ultrasound and it's confirmed. A 2nd baby didn't make it. \n\nI didn't know my heart could break like that. My grief is all encompassing. Then I looked at my husband, saw the misery and tears running down his face and my heart shattered into dust. His excitement at being a father, his attachment to the little girl growing in my belly that he talked to even though she couldn't hear him yet, all was replaced by a soul crushing sadness. \n\nThis can't be happening. This can't be our lives. They said we were young (27 &amp; 28). They said we were healthy. They said we'd have no problems having children. I guess they were wrong.\n\nSo now I guess we prepare for my d&amp;c. Now we wait until I'm no longer pregnant to test for a clotting disorder they suspect I may have.

None are fun places to be, really, but I'm so grateful they're here.\n\nI'm 33, husband is 37, TTC since Aug 2015.  I have unexplained ovulation issues, regular periods but don't seem to do it on my own. Started fertility treatments Aug 2016 and conceived with letrozole + trigger + IUI in November.  Unfortunately the fetus stopped growing around 6 weeks, which I found out right around the holidays.  That was really hard, I still don't know how I managed to be normal but I think... wine.   \n\nI had a D&amp;C early January, one of the silver linings I could find was that I could go back to playing soccer.  Which I stopped doing when I found out I was pregnant.  I've been playing several times a week since I was  a kid, I love it so much.  In my first game back (5 days post D&amp;C), I freaking broke my fibula in 3 places.  Worst injury I've ever had.  I ended up needing surgery, and taking most of January off work to recover from it.  It was such an interesting juxtaposition of the two events, a miscarriage barely any one knew about and then this very obvious injury.  People brought flowers, food, dropped by for visits.  It was strange but also comforting to have something so tangible to focus on instead with a clear recovery path.\n\nI just started letrozole again and will likely have an IUI next week.  I'm cautiously hopeful, but so worried about being gutted by another unsuccessful cycle and/or another loss.  I feel surrounded by babies, pregnancy, it cannot be escaped in my workplace or my friend group and I hate that I now hate it.  I hate that one of the shows I like (Girls) has an unplanned pregnancy story line... This week she held up a lentil to represent the size of her baby and I screamed \"Not all lentils end in babies!\".  Day 3 of meds MAY have me emotional.\n\nThis group has been very comforting to me as I gear up to TTC again, with all that entails.  My lady friend group is divided into people who want to get pregnant and then do, and people who are still on tinder.  So it's nice to have some space where I know folks more readily understand.

It was my first pregnancy, and I found out just two weeks after my husband deployed. HCG was bouncing all over the place, and we were hoping it wasn't ectopic. Woke up with cramps in the middle of the night, drove myself to the ER, and the ultrasound tech found a mass in my right tube. That pregnancy was successfully treated with one round of methotrexate. Devastating to handle by myself. \n\nI got pregnant again a few weeks after my husband came home from deployment in May 2016, and we were cautiously optimistic. What were the odds of an ectopic and a miscarriage back to back? Early scans looked good, everything was in the right place, and we told our families the good news. Had no idea anything was wrong until I went in for a 10 week ultrasound, to discover the baby stopped growing at 7 weeks, just after the last checkup. It was a MMC, and I took cytotec to miscarry at home. \n\nThird loss was today. After 7 months of trying and a couple days of positive pregnancy tests, I started bleeding. Went to the doctor's to get it checked out, and they suspect a chemical pregnancy. At least I hadn't let myself get excited about this one. The only thing I associate a positive pregnancy test with is fear, pain, and disappointment. Anyone else feel the same way? \n\nI just don't know what to do anymore. I'm 26 years old, super healthy (was a collegiate athlete), and we have had 3 losses in 18 months.
