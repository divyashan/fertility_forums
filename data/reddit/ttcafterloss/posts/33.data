He was 20 weeks and perfect in every way until his little heart stopped beating.\n\nWe spent 3 hours with him (one of my regrets from Clare was not spending enough time with her) and he was so beautiful. He had a double chin and was so chubby already! Which makes it even more WHAT THE FUCK HAPPENED - our last baby died at 21 weeks but had been struggling for weeks and was very tiny and scrawny. This baby (we named him Peter) looked so...healthy. \n\nNot knowing why I lost two babies this year is incredibly excruciating, especially since doctors have all told us it's unlikely we'll find a reason.\n\nLeaving the hospital after giving birth without a baby for the second time in 2016 is terrible. It's all so excruciatingly terrible and unfathomable and words still can't touch what this pain feels like. Any time to have this happen again would be hard, but this is just...unbearable. Because I got pregnant before my period ever returned, I really wasn't in a good place mentally and emotionally during this pregnancy. So to have it end like this...I honestly don't know how I'll get through it. How I'll survive this without feeling isolated and alone. \n\nIt's like I want everyone to know what's going on and no one to know because pretending I'm okay is easier than showing my pain. \n\nI've been pregnant for 62 weeks total, threw up dozens of times, had 2 surgeries, and gave birth twice - none of which resulted in a living baby. \n\nLife is fucking unfair. I'm damaged and broken but I don't want to people to know I am. \n\nOn a more practical note - I'm incredibly let down by my doctors for not taking better care of me during this pregnancy. For telling me I'm not high risk and that \"we'll treat this like a normal pregnancy.\" For not showing more concern or bending over backward to help me.\n\nGoing forward, I plan to send slides of my placenta to Yale, do a MFM consult and genetic testing for my husband and I, and be tested for protein c and s. Yale is no longer on my insurance (of COURSE. this year. Ugh) so I might have to write a letter to my insurance requesting continuity of care since I saw them just 6 weeks ago. If not, I have someone in Boston I can see. \n\nI just want answers, even if they can't find any, I want to try everything I can. I feel like I owe it to my babies. And to my sense of justice. \n\nThanks again for all your support - it means so much.

I lost my first baby at 9 weeks in January. During that pregnancy they noticed I had 2 uterian cavities. At first they thought it was a bicornuate uterus, which wouldn't have caused me to miscarry. But after I miscarried I had an MRI, and they determined it was a septate uterus. This means there was a septum in the middle of my uterus, which did not get much blood flow. So when my baby implanted on the septum he did not have the blood flow he needed. I had a hysteroscopic resection of the uterian septum, messing they removed the septum, and then I had lots of testing to make sure everything was fixed. Then we started trying again.\n\nI lost my second baby in August at 7 weeks. We don't know why. They ran lots of tests. All that came back was that my AMH levels are high.

So this cycle we're doing Letrozole. She did an ultrasound and determined I had 2 mature follicles. One follicle was 17.5 mm and the other was 18mm.

Sorry for the long-winded rant and word vomit ahead. Some may know me, I thought I was 8+5 today and just had my first scan which showed an empty gestational sac, or a blighted ovum. I had a MMC with twins followed by a D&amp;C at the end of July. I have one healthy 2.5 year old son.\n\nI knew in my gut something wasn't right, I've never had any real symptoms of this pregnancy. I tried to explain this to the nurse last week during my intake appointment and she just blew me off, and even said, \"well, could you maybe not be pregnant? Did you just take the one test?\" I was so mad, like are you serious? I single handedly kept Wondfo in business for the first month. Fuck that. And today my whole experience was just horrible. My husband was with me, but I was just a wreck even in the waiting room beforehand. I explained to the tech about my past, as I was already shaking and crying. When she started the scan, she was just silent, and never said anything. I had to deduct on my own that her silence meant something was wrong, and I just started crying and shaking and saying \"there's nothing there\" even though I couldn't see the screen. My husband could, and figured out it wasn't good. The tech still never said anything. She just kept clicking around and doing whatever while I cried and sobbed and my husband tried to console me. Finally after five minutes of scanning she said \"so you've had no bleeding?\" and that was it. Never said a fucking word about what she saw, about anything. I'm still so, so angry about that. \n\nSo after being insistent about my dates being correct and getting a positive test 13dpo, the doctor agreed that this is a blighted ovum. She thinks its just a stroke of bad luck, having two MCs back to back. I got upset about that and said I wanted testing done, that I'm 35 and I'm not going to continue down this road if something's wrong. She agreed and said that was more than fair and they'll do testing on me if it's what I want, but she said she would even go so far to put money on a bet that this was just coincidence since I have a healthy son already - so she said don't expect answers, which, of course, is all I want right now. But, as for testing, etc, that's a conversation for the future. It's hard for me to see, impossible for me to see really, that these two MMCs back to back are just \"bad luck.\" \n\nI chose the route of misoprostol this time, as I can't reason with having a D&amp;C when there's not even fetal tissue, and I don't want to run the risk of scarring, complications, or adhesions. I'm terrified, though. I just inserted the pills and I'm so, so scared. Does anyone have any advice, feedback, or info about what to expect? The doctor was very patient with me as I asked a lot of questions, but I can't even remember much of what she said because my mind is so numb. I have a second dose to administer in 24 hours if this one doesn't work. I have a feeling my body will fail at this too and I'll wind up needing a D&amp;C anyway, since it can't even fucking miscarry properly. \n\nI'm so angry. I'm so bitter. I'm so done with life throwing shit at me. And right before Thanksgiving... and I'm supposed to feel grateful right now? Fuck that. Fuck all of this. I know how ridiculous and immature it all sounds, that I have so much in my life to be grateful for. And it's not that I don't know that, that I don't see that and appreciate it in the back of my head. But not today. Today I'm fucking angry, and sad, and heartbroken all over again. I don't get it, I don't understand it. Am I just supposed to stop? Is this life giving me a sign, two in a row, that I'm not meant to keep doing this? What's so ironic is that my son was a total accident, an unexpected oops, and I took that pregnancy for granted every single day. Then when we actually make the decision to try, I have two miscarriages. Thanks a lot, life. \n\nI hope this anger and sadness passes because I know it's toxic. I'm so tired of crying. I know so many people have it far worse than me. I have a healthy, living son. I know I should be eternally grateful for him, and it's not that I'm not grateful - I'm just... I don't even know. I'm just angry today, angry at life, angry at what I'm supposed to do next, angry at wondering why it's happening again. Feeling victimized, feeling alone and singled out, feeling like I'm supposed to pay for something I've done.\n\nThanks for letting me rant.", "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "ttcafterloss", "subreddit_id": "t5_34scd", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Blighted ovum, questions, Angry rant.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/ttcafterloss/comments/5ecmv7/blighted_ovum_questions_angry_rant/"}, {"author": "Breaking_Bran", "author_created_utc": 1367224644, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_text": null, "author_fullname": "t2_bhxmm", "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1479845439, "domain": "self.ttcafterloss", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/ttcafterloss/comments/5ecvo3/question_about_recurring_blighted_ovum/", "gilded": 0, "id": "5ecvo3", "is_self": true, "locked": false, "media_embed": {}, "num_comments": 6, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/ttcafterloss/comments/5ecvo3/question_about_recurring_blighted_ovum/", "retrieved_on": 1484263631, "score": 2, "secure_media_embed": {}, "selftext": "I'm in the process (misoprostol) of miscarrying my second blighted ovum (BO), the first was in June this year.

I had a bunch of mature follicles, my lining was \"perfect\", I ovulated, my CD21 number was amazing, and we had tons of sex. I mean...come on! That's a reason for hope.\n\nSo, yes, it \"worked\". I conceived. I got a positive on Saturday at 9dpo...but it was such a squinter I called it a no (until it dried). Monday was 11dpo and it was there more...that was when I should have had a 1 year old and I was SO happy to see a positive on that day. It helped get me through it. 12dpo it was even darker. Progression!! This is good!!\n\nWhelp. No. My HCG is now 8 and my progesterone is super f'ing low. And I started bleeding. My doctors are already calling it a chemical. (of course I have to go back in after the holiday to re-test to make sure its negative)\n\nIt is my THIRD chemical this year (March, September, November). My FOURTH loss this year (MMC in February at 7+3). And my 5th loss overall (MC May 2015 at 10+4)\n\nF*ck everything about this process. Why can't my body keep a pregnancy?!?! I am completely torn apart and depressed about the prospect that I just cannot carry a baby. I mean, even IVF makes no sense if implantation doesn't work! And we have no idea why it worked twice only to fail a bit later on. I want a child SO BADLY. I should have a 1 year old this week and instead I am miscarrying again. \n\nI am ready to stop this shit and adopt, but my husband isn't. And I have to decide how much is too much...seeing how it IS MY body.\n\nThe doctors don't want me on Clomid this cycle, to let my lining recover from a miscarriage. So I can't even try again until late December (seriously fertile on Christmas, why not have all this shit around holidays). And as of today I have no idea what we're going to try differently...so I can't see a different outcome. And even if I do, we still don't know why the longer pregnancies still failed. \n\nI basically hate everything right now...and just wanted to share with you all.

Everything I google just tells me its something you see in prepubertal, perimenopausal, and menopausal women - no HELP! I'm reading that weakly proliferative endometrium is normal in polyps, but I also had that finding in my normal endometrial tissue. Anyone heard of this before? Thanks in advance.

In the 10 months since then, not one of them has asked me how I'm doing or tried to reach out to me at all, and I'm just really upset that when I tried to reach out to them I got nothing back. I don't know what to do. Like, part of me wants to just give up completely, they're all adults and it's really not my responsibility any more to be their mum. I spent all my teenage years getting them to school and making sure they had clean clothes and hot food every day.

Sorry in advance that this is so long. I didn't realize how much I needed to just write this all down. \n\nI am 29F living in Toronto with my DH and our 16-month-old son. We decided early in the Fall to try for a second and were blessed to succeed relatively quickly. I spent October feeling pretty bad, and experienced some prolonged bleeding which sent me in for 2 early ultrasounds that showed a heartbeat around 8 weeks. I felt crappy but confident. \n\nIn the first week of November, we went for our NT scan at around 11.5 weeks. The tech was not chatty and asked us if it was possible our dates were wrong (yes, it was) but gave me no reason to worry. The next day I had my first scheduled OB appointment and my whole world crashed down. My Dr explained to me that the NT scan had found a very abnormal measurement of the fluid behind the baby's neck - more than twice what would be normal. This could be indicative of a serious chromosomal disorder. She had already booked us in to come back to the hospital the next day to meet with a high-risk fetal specialist who would repeat the scan and help us determine next steps. My DH and I returned the next morning and the Fetal specialist confirmed it wasn't just a mistake. There was definitely something wrong. He immediately offered to do a CVS, which we agreed to. We hoped we would have results by the next tuesday, as my OB had OR time the next wednesday in the event that the results were particularly grim. Unfortunately, we did not get them on time and chose to wait on them before making any irreversible decision. When we did get the results, they weren't great. The baby had Turner syndrome, along with a host of other very serious heart and swelling issues. The doctors provided their advice that this baby was not going to make it through the pregnancy. We knew for us the right decision was to end the pregnancy quickly and not wait for the terrible to happen. It took another whole week to get time in the hospital OR with an OB I trusted. Overall, it was two weeks from the time that we learned the baby inside me was likely not going to make it until the moment that we are at now - square one, starting over. \n\nI have never felt so dark, and full of sadness. Even though I know that this truly was not our fault, and that it was essentially a fluke that this baby made it as far as she did, I can't help but feel guilt for what happened, and fear for what awaits us as we heal and start trying again. \n\nIt's nice to meet you all, though I certainly wish it were under other circumstances.

I'm here after recently finding out my pregnancy wasn't viable at 5 weeks. \n\nMy husband and I began trying for #2 in July. Our first is the product of IVF. We had 3 remaining embryos. The first two didn't take, but when the third did, I started cramping and bleeding the day after my second beta. I called the clinic and they told me it was normal, but to come in for another beta just to put my mind at ease.

If it's so early, does this make it a chemical pregnancy?\n\nI had everything riding on this. We are out of embryos. It is very unlikely we will ever conceive on our own.

Between ordering it and receiving it, I had second thoughts and tried to get the stones switched but it had already been finished at that point, so I kept it. Since receiving it, I have worn it probably less than a dozen times. It's a little physically uncomfortable (I'm not used to a ring on that finger), and sometimes emotionally uncomfortable when I don't really want to be reminded. \n\n[TW: language] I briefly considered ordering another one after this second loss and I even looked up May's birthstone...but then thought, \"I don't want to end up with a finger covered in rings dedicated to dead babies.\" And then I thought what about if I get to keep a baby one day? Will I have all these rings for losses and yet nothing to honor live babies?\n\nSo I spilled this all to her and she offered the suggestion of getting some candles and lighting them when I felt like it. I expressed some fear/hesitation at the fact that if they were specific candles for this, maybe I'm just sitting on the couch and I don't really want to think about it that day and I see them and get upset by them, etc. She suggested tea lights, since those are small and pretty much one-use...but that doesn't feel special enough to me. (Also do I get 3? 2? 1?) Maybe a nice holder that I can put away somewhere? I am non-religious, but I wouldn't be opposed to a ritual of some sort. Bringing out a specific thing, doing something, storing it away until next time. \n\nAll of this word vomit to ask is there a way you honor your losses? I welcome all answers but really interested in something you can do on certain days, but not be smacked in the face with it on other days, when you're not feeling up to it? \n\nMy losses were early, I know that the first loss was twin girls, thanks to the D&amp;C but there was no embryo/it happened at home the second time.

Well, I guess none of us really expects to be here.\nI feel pretty alone... I just need to talk it out.\n\nSo I track and temp, this is cycle 2 for me and my husband. I'm 33. Healthy, average woman. I was in BCP for the last 15 years. \n\nA little info on my first and recent CP. I'm including the details because all the CP posts I've seen are usually getting a positive hpt that lightens and then the bleeding begins- or a temp drop then bleeding. Mine is without a temp drop until after the bleeding and my hpt was strongest on the day of loss.\n\nOn 10DPO hpt was neg. \n\nOn 13 didn't feel like AF was coming - and I was now late- and I felt weird. I grabbed some Walmart tests which were positive. I didn't get excited. It was very faint.\n14DPO same thing, darker?? I took like 3, plus a FRER- faint line!!\n15DPO. Definitely a line on FRER and yes on a digital! I'm 3 days late on this day. Temps are high!  Told my husband!\n4 hours later I'm bleeding. \n\nI had cramps since O. They were worse that day though. Like a 5/10.\nI only bled lightly that day and a bit more of a medium flow (by my standards) the next. Now I'm spotting. I'm not sure if I could've filled a tampon with the blood. I only wore panty liners.\n My temp dropped what would've been 16DPO.\n\nAnd I'm thinking I'm done bleeding now... with only 2 days of light bleeding and one day of brown spotting. Is this normal? I expected more blood.\n\nMy period is always light. This was just like my period except slightly more mucous and more red blood.\n\nI'm worried that maybe my uterine lining is too thin. Maybe that's why I lost the pregnancy?\n\nAnyone else have very light (I can't even fill a light tampon in 8 hours) period?\n\nI just have a lot of questions. I'm sad. I am angry. I'm upset that I have no answers. My doctor didn't want to see me. The OBGYN wasn't interested in seeing me unless I was dying basically. \n\nI've read around that you're very fertile after a CP, although I haven't seen any evidence to back it up.

I'm new to posting on the Reddit TTC and pregnancy subs, but have been reading them regularly since we started TTC in June. \n\nWe got lucky and got pregnant fairly quickly in August, but miscarried 3 weeks ago today at 15w due to acute chronioamnionitis (infection in the amniotic fluid/placenta). They believe I had a UTI that got into the placenta somehow and caused me to go into preterm labour. I had cramps for 2 days but no bleeding so didn't worry at all. By Sunday night the cramps had got worse, and at 2am I went to wipe and saw blood. My husband took me to the ER and my water broke when I got out of the car. I gave birth to our little girl at 2:30am in the bathroom when I went to do a urine sample - I hadn't even been admitted to the hospital yet. It was the most traumatic night of my life \ud83d\ude41 and my husband has been my absolute rock. 4 days later I got a wickid kidney infection, so it seems I don't show symptoms of these things until it gets really bad, which worries me for subsequent pregnancies. \n\nWe are both ready to try again after I get my period but are in a bit of a dilemma. My family doctor (who was a bit useless after this all happened) has said it's fine to start trying again right away, which we feel emotionally ready to do after my first period. I also met with an OB thanks to a connection of a very close friend, and they have said they will follow my next pregnancy from the beginning and they were the ones to order all of my follow up blood work, ultrasound, etc. However, they recommended waiting 3 cycles to try again in our case (they normally recommend 1). I believe this is to make sure all possibilities of an infection are gone, but my follow up blood work and ultrasound both were clear and showed no signs of infection. \n\nNow I'm not sure what to do. We aren't young (31 and almost 36) and this will be our first, so we are both feeling the pressure of time. Who knows how long it could take to conceive the next time, too? But I don't want to go against the orders of the OB and start off my next pregnancy on the wrong foot if I were to conceive quickly. I just worry about wasting two good months if I feel ready to try emotionally and physically. \n\nAny suggestions or advice?

I had a D&amp;C last month. Mild bleeding/spotting lasted for about 10 days, then AF arrived 27 days after procedure. It was lighter than usual. Also, I had gotten pregnant on the first real try with OPKS. I was on birth control for about 20 years, AF came exactly 28 days after stopping, then pregnant the next month. So it seems like I'm really regular, but I also haven't had a lot of experience with my cycle off of BC.\n\nBefore the first AF after D&amp;C I got a mild rash on my arms and legs, looked like eczema maybe. At around CD14 I had a tiny bit of light brown spotting when I wiped one night. I thought that was weird because I don't usually have mid-cycle spotting. Anyway, last Sunday, I woke up with a rash starting around my mouth. By the next day it was on my chest, back of my neck, and around the groin. Was diagnosed with some type of contact dermatitis, possibly poison oak, and put on Prednisone. Well, it's been one of the most miserable weeks of my life. The healing is SLOW, the itching is relentless, and I've been out of work all week and not sleeping well even with Benadryl. Then last night and today (CD25) , I have the light spotting again. I don't know if it could be implantation bleeding. I didn't get any the first time. And like I said, I had the same type of spotting a few weeks ago. But what's driving me crazy is I would like to try maybe my prescription Restoril (Tempazepam) to see if I sleep better than I did on the Benadryl, but it seems to be a high-risk category. Not no mention I wouldn't be thrilled about being on Prednisone if I'm pregnant. I wish I just knew already, because I feel desperate to relieve myself of the discomfort and insomnia from this rash, but don't know if I want to risk pill-popping. Does it matter this early on?

We saw a baby with a heart rate of 132 on Wednesday. My RE (I've had 2 other miscarriages this year) said to stop taking progesterone on the 2nd (2 days ago). I took my last dose at about 2pm and then went to work at 7pm. In the morning, I had some light brown spotting, but attributed it to some leftover progesterone.\n\nThis afternoon, I woke up and had some dark brown spotting with some dark brown clots, about the size of a pencil eraser. I put in a progesterone again, just in case, and then afterwards noticed an even larger clot that was brown and slightly red, although it was hard to tell if it was blood red, or progesterone red (the pills themselves are rust-colored). Now I'm having small amounts of clots with dark spotting every time I wipe.\n\nEverything I read basically says it's a pretty ominous sign. I can't believe this is happening for the third time. If I miscarry again I'm honestly not really sure how I'll go on anymore. \n\nI'm a NICU nurse and I work with about 200 other ladies and everyone's always pregnant. It hurts to see literally everyone else my age on their second baby, and my body can't even keep one in there.\n\nI'll call the RE tomorrow, but I know what the outcome is going to be. This is how it started the first time.\n\nEdit: The doctor had me come in for another ultrasound. Baby looked ok, and they couldn't find a source of the bleeding :/ they restarted me on the progesterone, but I've still had some intermittent spotting and clots.\n\nI've also been having some cramping on and off (but admittedly I'm also so constipated and can't tell if that's contributing, haha.) I'm going back for another ultrasound on Tuesday morning, just to be safe.\n\nIt was happy to see the baby, but I still have such a bad feeling about everything.\n\nI'm glad my update earned me downvotes... wth\n\n", "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "ttcafterloss", "subreddit_id": "t5_34scd", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Probably miscarrying for the third time.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/ttcafterloss/comments/5gjl5o/probably_miscarrying_for_the_third_time/"}, {"author": "sallypeach", "author_created_utc": 1421698432, "author_flair_css_class": "", "author_flair_text": "TTC #1, CP Jan 16, MC Feb 16, TFMR 13wks Nov 16", "author_fullname": "t2_kte7f", "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1480907505, "domain": "self.ttcafterloss", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/ttcafterloss/comments/5gjl88/when_did_you_feel_normal_again_after_dc/", "gilded": 0, "id": "5gjl88", "is_self": true, "locked": false, "media_embed": {}, "num_comments": 15, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/ttcafterloss/comments/5gjl88/when_did_you_feel_normal_again_after_dc/", "retrieved_on": 1484305429, "score": 7, "secure_media_embed": {}, "selftext": "It's been a week tomorrow and I still feel like shit - I'm exhausted, still have pain and cramping in my uterus, and get dizzy if I stand up for too long.

Bernard is speaking to the mother of his son and reliving some memories.  \n\n\nMother: Oh. These talks. I don't know if they help or hurt. Do you ever wish you could forget?\nBernard: This pain. It's all that I have left of him.\n\nI heard this line and started tearing up right away.  Maybe the sentiment is a little depressing but I know I feel this way.  I remember my babies and though I start crying or feeling sad and the pain feels just as overwhelming as the day it happened, I still want the emotional response and catharsis.   Maybe not everyone feels this way but this definitely hit a chord with me. \n\nThanks for reading.
