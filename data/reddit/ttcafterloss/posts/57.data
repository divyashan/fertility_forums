He would be 9 on the 8th.\n\nI was pregnant with twins but lost one around 2 1/2 months. Other than that, it was a pretty normal pregnancy, up to 41 weeks. I had vasovagal syncope and SVT, but I was monitored well and was assured nothing was harming my boy. We were due on April 1st, but I carried a week longer. The day we lost him, I had a regular check-up since I was overdue. I had a US and everything looked great, he was great. During my NST, my doctor said that I was having small contractions and that Archer's heart rate was dropping a bit with each one. He assured us that it happens, it was nothing to panic about, but they were sending me to be induced that day. We got to the hospital and everything was okay for a while. I was talking to the anesthesiologist when this wave of people flooded my room. I was speedily prepped for the OR. I begged for answers and my nurse told me they lost Archer on their monitors. When I woke up, I was surrounded by crying faces. We had lost him. \n\nEven 9 years later, we aren't sure what happened. We were told he just ran out of blood. His body was pumping out immature cells as fast as they could to try and keep up, but he just couldn't. His autopsy came back with no answers. He was physically perfect. The placenta was perfect too. 150 years combined experience between everyone involved and no one had ever seen a case like his before. They said it was so rare that it probably had no name. He just lost all of his blood and they had no idea why or where it went. The doctor went back over the US multiple times and he couldn't see anything wrong. Blood flow looked great. \n\nI do okay throughout the year, but every time his birthday comes back around, I don't cope well at all. Not having him hurts more than words can describe, but not having an answer makes it worse. Every year, I try to google up some magical answer that will tell us what happened, and maybe even why it did, but nothing ever comes up. I can't even tell you how many times I sent articles to my doctor, asking if this could possibly be it. It never is. \n\nI just want answers. I know I can't have my son, so I just want answers.

So things have not be going so great for me emotionally; basically I have a very short fuse, and I have been feeling very down, when I am not totally high-strung anxious. I have had bouts of anxiety and depression off and on since I was a teenager, and although I consider myself pretty high-functioning, my miscarriage has of course only made these more acute. \n\nI went to my therapist today and she suggested I look into getting on some medication for my mental health. Her thought is that since I am sleeping enough, eating well, exercising, making an effort to connect with my friends, not drinking or using drugs, not in any sort of abusive relationship, etc, there could be something up with my brain chemistry that is making me feel worse. She says that studies show it is better to treat mental health issues than not in TTC/pregnancy, and suggested that I ask my OB/GYN what they think. I am open to the idea because honestly I am pretty damn sick of feeling the way I have been feeling. I realize that taking a pill is not going to solve all my problems, but if it helps, it might be worth it. Hell, maybe it will help me to \"just relaaaaax\" like people keep telling me to do.\n\nHas anyone here had experience with being or getting on an anti-depressant while TTC?

After only talking to me for a few minutes, he told me that it sounded like I my cervix was scarred together, and before I knew it I was set up for an in-office operative hysteroscopy and all was confirmed. My cervix was scarred shut, but, thankfully, my uterus and tubes were normal and scar-free. He gave us the green light to start TTC again. I got my period one week after the surgery, and my husband and I are gearing up for TTC this month. \n\nDoes anyone here have any experience with TTC after surgery to correct Asherman's?

I've been grappling with the news over the last 2 or so months and it's been hard.\n\nSometime in February I went in to my doctor's office because I was growing concerned. We were at month 7 of TTC after our miscarriage and had had no luck. For my husband and I, that's weird. As my post history will show, my living son was a second cycle success, our loss was an oops \"didn't pull out in time, but we are breastfeeding! We should probably be fine!\" pregnancy. So anything beyond a couple months is abnormal for our history (albeit anecdotal). So she suggested we do some bloodwork with my cycle on specific days (day 3 and day 21 if I remember correctly) and to do a full pelvic ultrasound, and while we were there, lets do the pap smear. \n\nWell bloodwork all came back normal, or within range, pap came back normal (had been having issues with pain/bleeding after sex which was a little concerning) and then we did the ultrasound. Well let me tell you, when the ultrasound tech goes \"have you not had any follow up U/S since May last year...?\" you know there's something going on. Then when you have a voicemail from your doctor's office within 2 hours of completing said U/S you *really* know something is up... \n\nWell talked to the nurse and they told me I had a \"significantly sized cyst on my right ovary when compared to May 2017\". They couldn't tell by the U/S images what it was specifically but it started my head spinning and making me want to just cry and throw up and just curl in a ball and die. They wanted to send me for an MRI, get the referral in to a local OB/GYN for possible surgery to remove it. I of course have to ask the question - \"is it possibly cancer?\" because I have a 2 year old at home and I want to kind of get my life in order because I'm aware that ovarian cancer is kinda a big deal. I also have a house and car loans and bills, and if I can't work I need to get all *that* stuff in order too.\n\nWell the nurse, bless her, said she couldn't say it *wasn't* cancer but was *pretty sure* it wasn't cancer. They think it's either a cyst related to endometriosis (so blood filled) or a dermoid cyst. Either way MRI is needed to get a better idea of what exactly it is, and how dangerous it is in terms of my ovary and tube etc doing funky things. \n\nFast forward about 2 weeks and I see the OB/GYN and he's the same one who saved my life with my son when I was brutally sick with HG and nearly died from dehydration/malnutrition and other complications related to 6 weeks of throwing up constantly and not eating/drinking. He took into account everything that has gone on in the last year and said he was going to give me his \"three for one special!\" (I love this doctor. He's been around forever, is now working with nurses in the L&amp;D that he DELIVERED and is now delivering some of their babies too! He's literally seen everything). He's going to do the laparoscopic surgery to remove the cyst, and look at everything else (to confirm whether or not I have endo, and presumably treat endo if present and requires treatment) and while he's in there, they are going to do a D&amp;C to hard reset my uterus, and while they are all up in my business already, they'll flush both my fallopian tubes and make sure there isn't anything wrong with them that's causing my sudden infertility issues. Basically he's hitting the hard reset button on my baby makers!\n\nHowever, in the meantime I cannot try for a baby. There have been many many many tears shed over this. If I manage to get pregnant before the MRI there are concerns since they need to use contrast for the MRI, there is concern about having the surgery to remove the cyst if I am pregnant (obviously the D&amp;C and tube flush wouldn't happen if I was pregnant) so they don't want us even trying to get pregnant. So we have minimum 2 more months before we even enter the surgical stage of this whole clusterfuck and then the 6-8 week minimum recovery time to start trying. So we are looking at likely June/July at the earliest before we can start trying again.\n\nI'm angry, I'm upset, I'm sad. I'm lost. I wanted to be pregnant before we hit a year from our miscarriage (which will be 1 year in like 2 weeks) yet here I am in limbo. Had the OB who took \"care\" of us during the miscarriage been a better doctor, and actually been useful and made me want to go to appointments then maybe we would have treated this cyst A YEAR AGO when it was first found! Instead my records from the care he gave us, never got forwarded to my GP, so even my family doctor didn't know what was going on, and still doesn't, and maybe I would be pregnant now, or already holding a baby. Shit, I don't know what this cyst is, we don't know what it means yet for my fertility. Will I lose the ovary? Will it actually turn out to be cancer? Will I have to endure chemo and more surgery and more time waiting for my rainbow baby? Hell, will I be allowed to safely have a second child of my own if I end up with cancer? Since this has been going on for nearly a year without any monitoring, will I even be okay? Is this going to be something that ends up killing me? Leave my husband a widower? My child without a mother, my mother without her daughter etc etc? \n\nThere is a part of me that wants to go after this old OB for how he handled everything should this cyst end up being damaging to my life. Make sure he doesn't do this to anyone else ever again. Take away my ability to have children or maybe enjoy watching my son grow up. I just can't wrap my head around how this was allowed to happen.

We planned to have lunch afterwards then go visit my family with our pregnancy announcement gifts.\n\nThey didn\u2019t find the baby on the ultrasound, only a huge abnormal placenta. The sac where baby was had mostly been absorbed by it. I was sent to my OB for an emergency appointment.\n\nI had none of the symptoms or risk factors for a rare Partial Molar Pregnancy, but there it was.\n\nI went with the D&amp;C because there is a small risk that this is a sign of cancer (choriocarcinomas), so the remains have to be sent to the lab. I didn\u2019t want to collect them and bring them in myself. My OB was able to do it yesterday afternoon.\n\nYesterday I felt so shocked and numb. Today I woke up feeling so... alone. Empty.\n\nI have an appointment next week to discuss the lab results, hopefully no cancer. Then I need to go back regularly to monitor my hCG levels and ensure they fall. My doctor also advises me to wait until after I\u2019ve had one full regular cycle to TTC again. So June maybe?\n\nWe began TTC in June last year.\n\nHowever, money is now a problem. This will potentially be the second year in a row that we have to pay the full insurance deductible / out of pocket (OOP) maximum for me. Last year I went to the ER for a large ovarian cyst and had it surgically removed. I had the full OOP amount saved up in my HSA account to pay for pregnancy, not a cyst. It was very difficult to make those payments. So we were paying on a payment plan as we went for the pregnancy. We will likely have to continue that payment plan for the D&amp;C costs. We were going to have to be very frugal/thrifty buying stuff for having a baby. I\u2019m not sure it would be possible to buy those things and also start a payment plan towards my 2019 OOP maximum.\n\nI hate healthcare in the United States. I feel like I\u2019m waiting for the sky to fall when the bills for the surgeon, hospital, and anesthesiologist to arrive.\n\n**Anyhow, I\u2019m 33 and have been trying to have a baby since June \u201817. I have a history of an ovarian cyst, endometriosis (confirmed when they removed endo tissue along with that cyst), and have a higher risk of molar pregnancy because I\u2019ve had one before.

I elected to have a D&amp;C.  It was my first major surgery, but thankfully everything went smoothly and I recovered quickly.  So while the whole thing was shocking and sad, compared to many experiences I have read on here it was pretty easy.\n\nWe waited two full cycles and then started trying again.  On my second cycle trying, I got pregnant.  Yesterday, at 5+2, I started bleeding.  It became heavy and I started passing clots.  I knew it was over- I felt my few pregnancy symptoms disappear.  While it was more traumatic to actually experience the miscarriage, I thought that overall it would be just as easy to recover from, if not easier because it was earlier.\n\nApparently that is not the case.  I went to the doctor this morning and had an exam and trans-vaginal ultrasound.  They told me they can't see the sac and they didn't see anything else to cause alarm in there, which is good.  However I have to keep an eye on how things are progressing and get my HCG levels checked over the next few days and then go in for a follow up appointment to make sure things are clearing out properly.\n\nA question- he said once they have confirmed that my levels have dropped, he wants me to stop taking my prenatal vitamin until I get my next period.  Anyone have any experience with that?  I didn't ask him why- information overload at that particular moment.  I'm concerned because I was advised to take my prenatals for a few months before starting TTC to let them build up in my system.   \n\nInterestingly enough, the day before this occurred I told my husband that if we lost this baby, I wanted to go on a trip before we tried again- I knew I would need something tangible to look forward to to get me through it.  Guess I was having a little premonition there, because now I definitely need something to focus on before I lose my grip completely.  We have to wait until school is over to go on the trip, so it will be a few months for sure before we start trying again.\n\nEmotionally it's easier because it was earlier and it's not my first loss, but physically it's so much harder.  I'm terrified that something will go wrong from here.  Then if I do get pregnant again, I will be 37 when I give birth.  The clock is ticking so loud.  Not to mention- what the heck is going on with my body and these lost babies??  It's all so overwhelming. \n\nThat turned out to be way longer than I planned- thanks for reading, and for the support &lt;3  ", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "ttcafterloss", "subreddit_id": "t5_34scd", "subreddit_subscribers": 3168, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Second MC, earlier But scarier...", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/ttcafterloss/comments/8cqmcf/second_mc_earlier_but_scarier/"}, {"author": "JessesGirl3864", "author_flair_background_color": "", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [{"e": "text", "t": "29, 23 week stillborn boy Nov 2017, TTC#2"}], "author_flair_text": "29, 23 week stillborn boy Nov 2017, TTC#2", "author_flair_text_color": "dark", "author_flair_type": "richtext", "brand_safe": false, "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1523910507, "domain": "self.ttcafterloss", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/ttcafterloss/comments/8cqqyq/cycle_3_of_trying_again_i_hate_sex_right_now/", "gilded": 0, "id": "8cqqyq", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "no_follow": false, "num_comments": 17, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/ttcafterloss/comments/8cqqyq/cycle_3_of_trying_again_i_hate_sex_right_now/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1523912872, "rte_mode": "markdown", "score": 5, "selftext": "This is our third month of trying again.

Found out on Christmas Eve.  Our families were so excited.  This was to be my in-laws first grandchild.  My first trimester was not great.  I had really bad morning sickness, was treated at the ER for morning sickness and lost 15 pounds.  I also went off my antidepressants for the pregnancy and suffered from severe anxiety.  For months i could only manage to work and then crash at home.  I felt so useless but we knew it was for our baby and would be worth it in the end, especially when we heard the heartbeat at 12 weeks.\n\nAt my 16 week appointment she couldn't find a heartbeat so did a handheld ultrasound.  We saw two babies. She couldn't see the heartbeat but said the babies were in a bad position and to come in later for an actual ultrasound.  My husband and I were thrilled to be having twins.  We would complete our family in one try. \n\nMy husband and I came in the next day for a true ultrasound.  I knew something wasn't right.  The tech didn't say anything and wouldn't show me the screen.  She left to go get the doctor.  My husband saw her label the pictures as baby A, B and C.  He was so excited and supportive of triplets, but i still knew something wasn't right.  I still wasn't prepared when the doctor confirmed that none of the babies had a heartbeat or movement.  In less than 48 hours we went from one baby to two to three and then none.  \n\nWe chose a D and E as i could not have handled induction.  The procedure went well but I still had heavy bleeding a few days later.  Ended up back in the hospital for a D and C as they were concerned about remaining tissue.  Turned out to be a lot of blood clots that my uterus wasn't expelling due to its size from having triplets.

She's been trying for five years and can't get pregnant.\" For some reason, this was her idea of small talk. And ever since then I have had anxiety about my fertility. Prior to that, I didn't worry too much because I knew I had already gotten pregnant once before. But now I'm laying in bed at 1am feeling upset because I'm afraid that I won't get the chance to be a mother again.\n\nI guess I'm just looking for some reassuring words or wondering if anybody else has struggled with these feelings before.
