I would think that since 9 days ago my HCG level was below 25 that it should be below 6 now but no luck. I'm probably just being impatient but worried about retained tissue.

Last night my brother in law's girlfriend came over (she knows about the MC) and started talking about her newborn baby cousin she was going to meet for the first time. She was so excited and kept talking about this newborn baby. I went a little bit quiet but didn't say anything. I went outside and was talking to my father in law (he also knows about the MC) and he said that he is excited for 2017 to be over because it's been such a horrible year for us. He then said that he was excited for 2018 to start because grandkids won't be far away. I said 'hopefully' and that was my snapping point. I removed myself and had a little cry outside and my MIL came out and had a chat with me which was lovely. Then the girlfriend came out and entered into the conversation saying how bad 2017 was and how her bosses told her 'not to get pregnant anytime soon'. I kind of lost it... I started bawling my eyes out and ran into my room. DH came in after me and I asked to be alone and asked to make sure nobody came in the room. So he went out, the girlfriend is crying and feels so bad but my brother in law was defending her saying that I shouldn't be so sensitive and blew up basically. DH was telling everyone that it's  still a sensitive topic and trying to calm everyone down. Brother in law and girlfriend left in a huff saying that he couldn't be around anymore. My FIL said basically the same thing and that they were over it... So now I don't know if we should go back home because I've made this awkward and I feel like DH and I are going to be ganged up on over this. I know my father in law is going to lecture me about how I reacted and that I need to move forward. I don't blame the girlfriend for what she said, I don't think there was any malice behind it but I still feel like it's something that should have been censored - know your audience and read the situation, right? Anyway, I'm just worried about what to do... DH wants to leave, but I think that will make things worse.

Your children will be the cutest. The littlest of anything is always the most adorable!\n\n2. Your children will be cherished because they're the last babies to pass through.\n\n3. Your children will always have playmates because there are already kiddos around. Cousins are built in best friends! \n\n4. Less pressure on your children because they're the youngest. If they can read better than your friend or sister's kids, that's amazing because your kids are younger!! If they can't read as well, that's understandable because they're younger. Think of it this way: Your kids can never be outshined by their kids, because even if the older kids do something great, they're older. There's at least a possibility of your kids outshining theirs. \n\n5. You won't feel like you're missing out on anything social with your friends or siblings, because they're already in parent land, so they're not doing anything non-child related fun. You don't have to be the only one to turn down concert night or Cancun vacation, because those don't happen anymore in your circle. Similarly, everyone will understand when you can't do something.\n\n6. If you're a competitive person or have a rocky relationship with your siblings, you can see how they did everything (nursery, social media announcement, school selections, etc...) and do it better ;-) You always want to go last in a competition.\n\n7. If you have a good relationship with your siblings (and assuredly you do with your friends or you wouldn't be friends with them), then the firsthand-experience advice that they can provide you every step of the way, from TTC to pregnancy to motherhood, is invaluable.\n\n8. Hand-me-downs!!!!!! Even siblings that you don't get along with will prob give you some stuff just to get it out of their house, and even if you save $50 that's amazing!\n\n9. They literally come out with new awesome parenting tools every year.\n\n10. This one is only for the petty at heart: doing something last upstages the first one/s who did it, even if it's a few years later. Being the first may have its novelty of feeling special, but it's not how you start, it's how you finish. People are more likely to remember the last, freshest, most recent and forget about the old news. Also, what's the point of feeling \"special\" when it won't last, because as soon as someone else gets pregnant, first isn't special anymore (This is something you should only be happy about if your siblings or in-laws have been shitty with you.)", "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "ttcafterloss", "subreddit_id": "t5_34scd", "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "10 Reasons why It's best to be the last to have kids", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/ttcafterloss/comments/7lvjbm/10_reasons_why_its_best_to_be_the_last_to_have/"}, {"author": "yehonam26", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_text": null, "brand_safe": false, "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1514147756, "domain": "self.ttcafterloss", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/ttcafterloss/comments/7lxbsn/dear_santa_please_can_i_have_2_blue_lines_this/", "id": "7lxbsn", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "locked": false, "num_comments": 12, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/ttcafterloss/comments/7lxbsn/dear_santa_please_can_i_have_2_blue_lines_this/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1514290329, "score": 37, "selftext": "I am currently sat at home on my own while SO is at work (until midnight).

Instead I only have 3 stockings to prepare. \n\nI was did with our loss sometime in mid/late December (don't remember the exact date but still it was supposed to be around Christmas I was due). I can't help but be sad that this is my reality. No super big bump that I'm cursing and \"hating \" because it's getting in the way or a newborn who is stuck to me like Velcro so I can't get anything done plus a 2 year old. No, instead I have a quiet house while my 2 year old sleeps and my husband is upstairs in bed. \n\nI have so much to be thankful for and be happy for but I can't help but just want to sit and sob and drink all the wine (oh yeah. And I am NOT pregnant this month. All I wanted was to be pregnant by our due date... didn't happen). My husband has been amazing these last couple weeks as I've had a few really major meltdowns over this. Last week I had a huge hissy fit because I got very specifically reminded we should have had a baby around now and I remember him saying \"we will have our little Squishy baby soon \" and I just responded with a pouty and teary  \"but we should have had our baby now!\" And fell into another puddle of tears. \n\nWe got our yearly Christmas ornaments and he asked if I wanted to get an ornament for our Squid (I started referring to our baby we lost as Squid because I hate referring to things as \"It\") and I started to melt down at the little kiosk. So many people I know and so many people in my pop culture circle are announcing pregnancies and I'm overjoyed for them but at the same time it just makes me hate everything and want to know why. Why us?why can't we seem to get pregnant. With my son it took 2 months, our loss was an accidental one time mistake and we were pregnant. Why this time it's been over 6 months of no luck. I can't help but think maybe this is it. I only get to have 1 baby and that's it. I went into my marriage wanting 3 babies. With my first pregnancy we had a very rough time and now have rethought that idea and would be happy with 2 babies. If things go really Well, maybe I'll revisit having a third child. But all I want is 1 more little one to care for.\n\nThis is getting rambly so my apologizes. I needed to get this out before I went nuts because it's just eating me up because there's a large part of our families that don't know what happened last spring and I feel like I need to hide what happened to avoid some unneeded bullshit in our lives but it also means bottling up some of the pain.", "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "ttcafterloss", "subreddit_id": "t5_34scd", "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Because I know you guys will understand", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/ttcafterloss/comments/7lzdmk/because_i_know_you_guys_will_understand/"}, {"author": "AutoModerator", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_text": null, "brand_safe": false, "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1514186083, "distinguished": "moderator", "domain": "self.ttcafterloss", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/ttcafterloss/comments/7m070z/ttcafterloss_ttc_daily_discussion_thread_december/", "id": "7m070z", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_css_class": "ttc", "link_flair_text": "TTC Thread", "locked": false, "num_comments": 18, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/ttcafterloss/comments/7m070z/ttcafterloss_ttc_daily_discussion_thread_december/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1514317711, "score": 2, "selftext": "**This thread is for members who are TTC or waiting to try.

I know that logically my thoughts are oh so very unfair and not realistic but I struggle to argue logic with my emotional brain. The closer I get to my original due date, the more trouble I have with regulating my emotions around my original loss. I get so mad at my wife because she doesn't know what it's like to lose one, let alone 3 pregnancies in 6 months. I am mad that she wants me to think about what I want to do for my 30th birthday party in a couple of weeks when all I think about is how I should be worrying about finishing touches on the nursery.

I then deleted my username and post history to try to move on. So we lost our first babe in July. Got pregnant in August. That babe was sticky and we made it to 20 weeks before the baby passed away and I opted to have a D&amp;E two weeks later after several follow ups instead of labor. (It was the right choice for me, and I don\u2019t regret this. Bonding with that baby would not have helped me.) \n\n\nAnyway, the point of of this post. The D&amp;E was on December 19th, and I\u2019m ready to try again. However, due to unfortunate distance circumstances, my husband and I won\u2019t be able to try until\nMarch - the same week my first baby would have been due. I literally (cannot stress this enough) don\u2019t think I could handle missing two due dates without another pregnancy. What are your experiences with ttc after a D&amp;E without waiting for a cycle? \n\n\nExtra info: My doctor told us one cycle and we can try again if that matters. I completely stopped bleeding four days after the D&amp;e. I\u2019m also not on any meds that would impact a new pregnancy. My husband is on board with whatever I decide.

My daughter was born on 11/30 after a normal pregnancy with normal genetic tests and a normal anatomy scan. We took her home. But she was very lethargic. Everyone we talked to attributed this (and her lack of interest in feeding) to being born at 37 weeks. And in 99.99% of babies, they would've been right. Yet after a week at home, she still wasn't turning a corner and \"waking up,\" as everyone (pediatrician, home health nurse, lactation consultant) predicted. Off to NICU we went. After ruling out acute causes for her state, we got into chronic conditions. And were diagnosed with a terrible and rare genetic syndrome: Early Infantile Epileptic Encephalopathy. Her particular case was extreme and there was no chance for any kind of normal brain activity. Basically, within three days, we went from thinking we had a sick baby to learning we had a pre-terminal baby.\n\nWe took her home from the NICU and loved the heck out of her. We snuggled her every chance we got. She was always on one of our chests. Our plan was to repeat the brain scan in a week and then pull the feeding tube if the prognosis was still the same (which we were fully expecting). Before we could, she had an apnea episode and passed away for about ten minutes. It was very sudden at first, then she brought herself back, which was horrible and surprising to experience. She was on her way out after that. We had a hospice nurse with us and administered medications to calm the seizures that started because she was without oxygen for so long. (Not that brain damage was one of our concerns, since her brain was already the problem.) The process took eight hours. It was an honor to walk with her as far as we could go. Even though we knew she was home to pass away, we still wanted more time. We were expecting weeks, because of what the hospice team told us might happen. We only had her for two days once she was discharged.\n\nI miss her so much, but she was never going to be capable of life. Most children with her condition die within two years. She was obviously very sick, because she lived for sixteen days and needed feeding and oxygen support. There was no chance for her to ever experience anything. She was not conscious of anything, ever, even in utero, as it turns out. This was not the baby that we dreamt of (even though we loved her and always will). \n\nMy body thinks I should have a baby. My brain thinks I should have a baby. My boobs think I should have a baby (I was pumping all of her food and have finally weaned this week). My hormones think I should have a baby. It is so hard to sit here without a baby. We do want to try again. We have to do IVF to procreate because of a sperm issue. Our genetics specialist (not connected to the IVF clinic, so there's no bias) doesn't think this happened because of IVF. We are still waiting to figure out if this was a random mutation or if it was inherited because we're silent carriers. Our son was born healthy, as far as we know. Though there are other disorders under this umbrella that manifest later in childhood, which is now my new nightmare. We will need to figure out what our odds are of having another child with this, and if our remaining embryos are affected. There's a long road ahead of us, but at least now we will know why this happened and how to proceed. I want to grieve and honor our daughter, but I also want that baby that we made room for in our hearts and our family and our home. Our RE wants us to wait six months before we try again, for the sake of my body. I think that's a good amount of time. I am ready to have a baby in my arms right this moment, but I do recognize that I need to heal physically and grieve emotionally.\n\nFor anyone who read this whole thing, thank you. I don't know what I'm hoping to get from writing it, but it feels good to talk about what happened to people who understand.

I\u2019ve been a lurker here for a while but feel ready to post finally. \nI had a loss at 20 weeks back in October of this year. This was my 4th pregnancy (1 MMC, 1 healthy term baby, 1 early MC previously). Normal pregnancy initially with 2 normal scans and 1st trimester screening. We went for our anatomy scan at 19 weeks and my world fell apart. Baby had zero amniotic fluid and was measuring 16 weeks. Was sent to perinatology who diagnosed a likely chronic abruption, although I never had pain or bleeding. Blood flow through the placenta was so bad her heart was failing. Her passing was imminent. Even if we made it to \u201cviability\u201d she would have no functional lungs and would be too small to survive.  She was also starting to be compressed by my organs and had no room to move.  I had a D&amp;E a couple of days later as I didn\u2019t want her to suffer any further.\nOther than a crummy clotted placenta, all tests on her and me were unrevealing. We met with the perinatal people again yesterday to discuss what happened and if we could try again. He diagnosed CAOS Syndrome. No good reason why this happened- just bad luck. He thought it would not happen again but this Syndrome is rare so couldn\u2019t give me a numerical risk.\nSo here I am. Trying for my 5th pregnancy. I am terrified of getting pregnant again but I feel like the longer I wait the worse it will be. There is no \u201csafe time\u201d. I cant imagine wanting to tell anyone about a future pregnancy until the 3rd trimester. I will not be happy or content in pregnancy until I have a crying baby in my arms again.\nI\u2019ve spent the last couple of hours reading through this sub and sobbing.

I have been reading this sub for a while and want to stop lurking and seek some support. I have lost 3 pregnancies, had a chemical pregnancy, and have now had so many invasive, expensive tests that haven't yielded any helpful answers other than that I need to take vitamins. \n\nThis October, after having biweekly scans for the whole of my first trimester, I felt like something was wrong (very light spotting and cramping, but mostly just a sinking feeling and terrifying suspicion that something was not right) and went in to see my specialist, who did another scan and told me my cervix was a little but short but not short enough to go on bed rest. He sent me home with orders to not exercise and take it easy. The next morning, I had a big contraction while showering for work. A few hours later my water broke. I was 14 weeks. Then, after going home to rest for a few days with little to no amniotic fluid and already starting to grieve the likely loss of yet another baby, I delivered my baby under somewhat traumatic circumstances at the local ER and had a D&amp;C. \n\nThis loss is different than the others. \n\nI had been watching my baby grow. She was developing wonderfully. I had been to two specialists and been cleared (more like dismissed as being overly concerned as I had *just* had two losses previously and didn't *need* to be concerned this pregnancy would go wrong). This one is different because I had told more family and more friends and even my work because my pregnancy was going to really change my work circumstances. This one is different because I was planning (baby showers and daycare and maternity leave and baby names and hopes and dreams) and thinking and praying and trying to do all the right things. It is different because there is no place for my feelings, my grief, in my life right now. This one is different because my sister forced her nursery furniture, infant clothes, and toys on me years ago and now that is serving as a constant reminder of my loss. I know she was trying to be helpful. \n\nI waited and waited to have children because my husband wasn't ready - I decided to get a doctorate instead, which has been hella difficult on our relationship, finances, and my mental health. Now I am grieving the loss of the future I have wanted so long and feel like everyone around me is just expecting me to be better and be ready to try again. Especially my husband, who says nothing when I burst into tears. Now I am months away from completing my doctorate (if I can get my dissertation done, which is not exactly easy to work on right now because I am barely functioning).\n\nI have now been to three different specialists and have been diagnosed with an MTHFR mutation, a blood clotting disorder, and endometritis. So many other, potentially more scary things, have been ruled out. Which is not all that reassuring. Because I don't know why this happened. Or if it will happen again. I am too devastated to think about starting over again, but I am trying to hang on to hope for the life that I want. I know there will be a baby in my future. \n\nI am finding the need to educate myself on current medical journals so that I can be an informed patient - one of my doctors wanted to install an IUD for 6 months as it *might* help clear up inflammation in my uterine lining. This was before the endometritis was even diagnosed. A different doctor did the endoscopy. The same (first) doctor was going to prescribe Lovenox (blood thinner) and steroids for the blood clotting issue and inflammation. These drugs are potentially harmful, but do not have proven benefits for pregnancy outcomes according to a journal article I read and the other, new, doctor. Now I'm not sure which doctor to go with for my care - or if I am even ready to try again. Ready or not, I like will be trying again next month.

My partner and I have been together for nearly 5 years, and while the pregnancy wasn\u2019t planned and was probably a bit soon for us, we had discussed having children and were excited. \n\nAt 11+2 I started spotting. My GP referred me to the GAU for an early pregnancy assessment at 11+5. The U/S showed that the baby only measured 6-7 weeks and had no heartbeat, but they wouldn\u2019t not confirm MMC until after a follow up scan a week later. The second scan confirmed that the pregnancy had failed to progress and, as I hadn\u2019t miscarried naturally, I was given medication to speed up the process. The medical intervention did not work, so a week later I went back for a D&amp;E procedure. The three weeks this went on for were physically and emotionally exhausting. In the end, I just wanted everything to be over so that we could try to move forward.\n\nThe miscarriage has significantly affected my mental health, and I am terrified that I won\u2019t come out of this depression until I give birth to a healthy baby. I have been seeing a therapist since before the pregnancy due to struggling emotionally with being NC with my mother and, while the sessions are helpful, my depression is showing no signs of abating.\n\nI want to try again as soon as possible, and have been tracking and taking folic acid along with other vitamins. My partner has encouraged me to continue to prepare my body and track my cycles, but when I bring up trying again, he keeps suggesting reasons why we should wait, e.g. waiting until we\u2019re more financially secure/until he\u2019s got a new job/until we move (if we do decide to move). Additionally, while he encourages me to take my supplements, he forgets to take his nearly every day, and keeps saying he\u2019ll start taking them properly soon.\n\nI have told him how I feel and have explained that I would like to be out of the first trimester of the next pregnancy before the due date of our first baby, which he says is fine, but he still keeps pushing back when he\u2019d like to try again. Initially we talked about January or February, then last week he said March, and now he\u2019s suggesting April or May.\n\nI can\u2019t help but get upset about it. I desperately want to be pregnant again, and he knows that. I don\u2019t know if he\u2019s making excuses about why we should wait because he\u2019s struggling with the MC; he\u2019s not particularly forthright when discussing his feelings or emotions. I have tried speaking to him about how he feels, and he keeps saying that he\u2019s sad about it but that he\u2019s doing okay.\n\nI have always felt that having children would allow me to build a real family with someone I love, and would give me a chance to be the kind of mother I would have loved to have had. My partner knows this, but had only come round to the idea of having children in the last couple of years due to his own family issues, and part of me is afraid that he has changed his mind about having a family with me. \n\nI really don\u2019t know what to do. When I try speaking to him I just get upset and I can tell he\u2019s getting frustrated. I don\u2019t want to pressure him if he\u2019s not ready, but I just want him to be honest with me.\n\nTL;DR - I want to try again after MMC, but my partner keeps suggesting reasons to wait and pushing back TTC cycle.

This is my first post, so I hope I am doing this correctly. I really enjoy reading the posts and comments on this sub. It is a great resource and support system for so many.\n\nI had my second consecutive loss on Friday, November 24th. It was a natural MC this time (I had a D&amp;C the time before). I was out of town visiting my FIL for Thanksgiving and had my HCG levels tested after seeing my doctor when I returned home (two weeks later, it was a long horrible wait). They were low- 47 on December 7th, 17 the following week, and in 8 the week after that. The nurse was proud to say that 8 was close enough and that I had \"graduated\" from blood draws and could go on my merry way.\n\nI did an OPK for the heck of it a few days after my 47 HCG result and it was very very faint. I did it again for the heck of it between getting the 17 HCG result and the 8 HCG result and it was either positive or very close (I have trouble determining that on the cheap strips sometimes). I know that it wasn't a positive due to HCG being in my system seeing as I had done it the week before with a negative result.\n\nSo what the heck is my question?.... Was my HCG low enough to have ovulated at that point or was that test a fluke result? I assumed that the level would have to be 0 for in order for ovulation to take place... but what the heck do I know? I have been taking OPK's here since my \"graduation\" from having my beta tested and they have all been negative. I have had some very light spotting this evening, so I am thinking AF is coming, which would put me 12 or 13 days after the positive OPK (which would make sense).\n\nThanks!", "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "ttcafterloss", "subreddit_id": "t5_34scd", "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Ovulation after a miscarriage with trace hCG?", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/ttcafterloss/comments/7n4z75/ovulation_after_a_miscarriage_with_trace_hcg/"}, {"author": "Sweetdimps", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_text": "38, FTM, MMC @7w5d", "brand_safe": false, "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1514677362, "domain": "self.ttcafterloss", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/ttcafterloss/comments/7n4zek/how_dare_life_go_on/", "id": "7n4zek", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "locked": false, "num_comments": 3, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/ttcafterloss/comments/7n4zek/how_dare_life_go_on/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1514749554, "score": 18, "selftext": "I'm in that period of grief where I'm starting to realize everyone else's lives are continuing, that even my closest loved ones are probably feeling the weight of my stillbirth lifting, but I am still very much trapped in it.

I hope it's okay to post here. I (probably) had a CP. Starting Wednesday I had lines on tests that never got darker, and a negative hCG blood test yesterday afternoon. AF hasn't started yet, but I started spotting yesterday and it has gotten slightly heavier today. Temp still up, and no debilitating pre/AF cramps like usual, but.... this was one of the first cycles I felt ovulation pain (at least that's what I assumed it was) I had cramping on the left side for several hours on O day. Yesterday night and into today I've had more cramping in about the same spot on my left side. Basically where my appendix would be if it were on my left (although maybe an inch or so down?). \n\nDoes anyone know if this something that can happen with a CP? Or a cyst or something? I know no one can actually tell me what it is, and if the pain gets more severe or continues, I will absolutely go to the doctor and/or urgent care but for now it's just twinge-y, and I was wondering if that sort of thing was common with a CP? I've never felt it before in a year of TTC and examining every twinge, cramp and ache!\n\nAlso anyone who wants to share experiences with AF (bleeding, cramps) post-CP, I'd love to read them. I have a super busy week at work and I'd love to know what I'm in for.

On Tuesday my line was super faint, but I didn\u2019t worry too much because it was one of those internet cheapie tests and I thought maybe it was defective. I started spotting Wednesday and got into the doctors right away. Their urine test was negative so they drew blood. The next day I got a call saying my HCG was 20 and they wanted to retest on Friday. By the time Friday came I was bleeding very heavily but they still wanted to test my blood. I won\u2019t know the results until Tuesday due to the holiday but I\u2019m almost 100% positive my levels dropped. I had two days of very heavy bleeding with horrible cramps.

I am struggling with how to tell my SIL about this, because if they are still TTC, it will be upsetting to her. I\u2019ve been there. Hearing pregnancy announcements is like a knife to the heart when you\u2019re TTC after loss. Should I forgo a public Facebook/IG announcement completely? Should I call or text SIL to tell her and then do a public announcement? I\u2019m not sure how I would want to be told, and I\u2019ve been in her shoes. I would love input from you.\n\nI should add that since our loss and struggle to conceive, I find most pregnancy announcements somewhat tacky.

I'm 21, in a mostly stable, committed relationship. We're engaged. We are also not really ready to be parents, being that we're so young, he's still in college, barely know ourselves yet... etc. Etc. \n\n\nDecember 2016 I had felt weird for a couple weeks, so despite being on birth control, I took a test. Positive. Cue panicking, telling him, more panic. We hadn't even decided what we wanted to do yet. I ended up having an ultrasound done at a walk in clinic because of how I use BC, I don't have periods for 3 months at a time - so I could have been anywhere in that time frame. Ultrasound showed that the pregnancy wouldn't be viable - it was a tubal/ecotpic that we got very lucky to catch early. Obviously we had to terminate it. It was horrible. I would have been due in August, and instead I lost the baby I had barely had a chance to know I wanted on Christmas eve, 2016. \n\n\nThe due date passed without bothering me too much. I was busy, and that helped. But the holidays have been horrible. Part of it is the fact that my fiance's 2 older half sisters are both new mom's- 1 gave birth shortly before this mess in Dec 2016, and the other was due 3 days ago, so could be any day. Part of it is thinking about how this would have been my child's first Christmas. \n\n\nSince August, I've found myself becoming more and more interested in being a mom. I didn't even want children before this all started, and now I think about it every day. I'm still on birth control because we are NOT ready to have a child. But I find myself thinking about it often and periodically find myself buying pregnancy tests at the dollar store, half hoping that they'll be positive. \n\nWe aren't trying. We can't for a while, and maybe thats it? I really don't know what to do. I feel like I've gone crazy. The baby rabies has bitten me strong, and combined with grieving our loss and not being able to try again for years, I'm losing my mind. My fiance talks about wanting kids in 5 or 6 years or more... I logically know he's right about waiting, but I don't want to also.\n\nSorry if this is scattered. I work nights and I'm up past my bedtime.
