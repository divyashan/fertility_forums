The appointment lasted 6-8 minutes tops.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNora had myelomeningocele spina bifida.  The open lesion on her back was approx. 5-8cm and ran from L1-L3.  She never moved her legs.  She had Arnold Chiari II malformation, where her cerebellum was poorly formed and her hindbrain was herniating through the opening in her skull.  She had severe hydrocephalus.  Her feet were clubbed.  Her corpus callosum was missing.  She was not a candidate for in utero surgery.  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI miss her.  She was so wanted.  I am struggling with my decision to terminate, but if i could go back I would make the same decision every time.  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThanks for reading.  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "ttcafterloss", "subreddit_id": "t5_34scd", "subreddit_subscribers": 3923, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Intro Post (tfmr 20w)", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/ttcafterloss/comments/9mr18z/intro_post_tfmr_20w/"}, {"author": "Rainbowhope5", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_2dpmkoyf", "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1539110596, "domain": "self.ttcafterloss", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/ttcafterloss/comments/9mrtzz/lost_baby_number_5/", "gildings": {"gid_1": 0, "gid_2": 0, "gid_3": 0}, "id": "9mrtzz", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 21, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/ttcafterloss/comments/9mrtzz/lost_baby_number_5/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1539110597, "score": 1, "selftext": "I feel so hopeless, empty, and I am over it .....

She passed in utero. Reading the reflections of loss that many of you have shared has been powerful, and helped me feel less alone. \n\nOur trying to conceive journey has been long, and with many ups and downs - mostly downs. From delaying going off the pill due to an injury, to not conceiving naturally and accepting we needed a medical work-up, to discovering that we had severe male factor infertility that pushed us from trying to conceive naturally to IVF overnight, to failed IVF cycles, simply getting to pregnancy was hard, and filled with loss. \n\nWhen we finally achieved success with IVF#3, I didn't trust that it was going to work out. Every time I went to pee, I was looking for blood and signs of miscarriage. My first trimester was filled with anxiety, even as the positive milestones kept coming - high betas, perfect ultrasounds, NT scan, and low risk through integrated screening. I finally let myself breathe and start planning our life to be with this little girl. But it started falling apart at her anatomy scan, when she was tracking a full two weeks behind. We went through a battery of tests, including screening for infections and several amnio tests. We had a scheduled growth scan 4 weeks after the anatomy scan. In that time, nearly all results came back normal. I had an OB appointment where her heartbeat was strong. We dared to hope that maybe she was just going to be small, but healthy. \n\nThe day before our growth scan, we got the final amnio result back - she had a rare microduplication. They told us that it was a tough case to offer genetic counseling, because there were documented cases where the duplication meant nothing (and it was likely hereditary - so my husband or I could have it, and not know), or it could mean everything - severe neurodevelopmental issues, schizophrenia, skeletal issues, and more. We decided we needed the follow up scan to make any decisions. It took seconds into the scan for the sonographer to tell us, \"There's no heartbeat. I'm so sorry for your loss\". \n\nI had a D&amp;E over the course of the following two days. We are heartbroken, and miss her beyond measure. We have since found out that my husband carries the duplication, and we need PGD (gene specific testing) on top of IVF. We are working with a genetic testing company to develop the PGD test. I need to wait two cycles before they'll let me go through IVF again, and at least 6 mo from D&amp;E before they'll let me transfer an embryo again. \n\nAll I can think about is trying again - not to replace her, but to give her a sibling who can help take some of this pain away. I have a feeling I'll be here often for this next chapter, whatever it may hold. I'm sorry we're all here, but glad to have found you. \n\n&amp;#x200B;", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "ttcafterloss", "subreddit_id": "t5_34scd", "subreddit_subscribers": 3925, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Intro - IVF / Stillbirth", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/ttcafterloss/comments/9mrvny/intro_ivf_stillbirth/"}, {"author": "PokeMyEyes", "author_flair_background_color": "", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_template_id": "8b677c92-711f-11e4-b63c-12313b0b807d", "author_flair_text": "9/7 - TFMR @ 14w | TTC #2", "author_flair_text_color": "dark", "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_183c2n5y", "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1539113684, "domain": "self.ttcafterloss", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/ttcafterloss/comments/9ms9uh/my_post_for_pregnancy_and_infant_loss_awareness/", "gildings": {"gid_1": 0, "gid_2": 0, "gid_3": 0}, "id": "9ms9uh", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 25, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/ttcafterloss/comments/9ms9uh/my_post_for_pregnancy_and_infant_loss_awareness/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1539113684, "score": 1, "selftext": "Hey, I just wanted to get some opinions on this post I'm planning on making to facebook. Some people know about my loss, and a good few of those don't know it was TFMR, so it's a bit of a coming out as well as an awareness post, and I feel very nervous. I rarely post on FB to begin with, so I'm afraid I'll look attention seeking or silly. \n\nI'm really open to opinions on how I could modify it, if you have any.\n\n&gt;October 9th-15th is home to an awareness campaign in which I'd never imagined I'd participate. While I understand that discussion of pregnancy loss is uncomfortable, both for grieving parents and those without the words to express condolences nor the experience to relate, it's a topic that shouldn\u2019t be left in the dark. So, in honor of pregnancy and infant loss awareness week, I\u2019d like to tell my story. \n\nSomewhere between 10-25% of pregnancies end in loss, and nearly half of those losses occur as miscarriages within the first 6 weeks of pregnancy. So, when I had my labs run for genetic testing at 10 weeks I thought I was in the clear. I was young and healthy, after all. When the results returned two weeks later, instead of celebrating our future son, we were scheduling tests that would later confirm a fatal Trisomy 13 diagnosis. Two weeks after that we made the easiest and most painful decision we've ever been asked to make. \n\nThe greatest pain didn't stem from losing our baby, rather from the future we lost along with him. Expectations plant themselves without hesitation the moment we learn about our pregnancies, and those roots are lain under the assumption that they won\u2019t be ripped out. It doesn't matter when your loss occurs, losing an imagined future and deconstructing those expectations is an extremely painful process. I'm lucky to have family and friends who supported me throughout the prolonged process from diagnosis to termination and beyond.\n\nNext time you want to ask a couple when they\u2019ll have kids, or when you feel the need to inquire whether someone is working on making their wonderful child a big brother or sister, bear in mind that they may have tried. They may have been successful, too. And, unfortunately, they may have lost that baby. That future. Beyond the scope of pregnancy or infant loss, it\u2019s possible that they\u2019ve struggled with fertility, or that their current status is the one they plan to live with. \n\nUltimately, the reproductive lives of strangers and loved ones are not open to question unless they open that door for you. \n\nI will not censor my experience for the comfort of a nosey stranger. I will do my best to make sure no one feels responsibility to locate the words of wisdom in an attempt to remedy what has happened. But I can\u2019t pretend that he didn\u2019t exist. \n\nPregnancy loss is not shameful, no matter how or when it happens. If you are willing to do so, speak up. If you can't, know you're not alone. \n\n\n", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "ttcafterloss", "subreddit_id": "t5_34scd", "subreddit_subscribers": 3926, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "My post for Pregnancy and Infant loss awareness week (Need opinions)", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/ttcafterloss/comments/9ms9uh/my_post_for_pregnancy_and_infant_loss_awareness/"}, {"author": "starloo", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_8vt44lz", "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1539116607, "domain": "self.ttcafterloss", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/ttcafterloss/comments/9msp5v/dealing_with_ashermans_syndrome_months_after/", "gildings": {"gid_1": 0, "gid_2": 0, "gid_3": 0}, "id": "9msp5v", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_css_class": "update", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_template_id": "92c13428-b9f0-11e4-a115-22000b3c862d", "link_flair_text": "Update", "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 14, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/ttcafterloss/comments/9msp5v/dealing_with_ashermans_syndrome_months_after/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1539116608, "score": 1, "selftext": "This has been by far, the most awful journey I have had to go through in my life.

We TFMR at 20 weeks due to Trisomy 18. It was our first pregnancy and were just extremely excited to start our family. \n\nWe had our first trimester genetic testing along with a NT ultrasound and everything was fine. We got out of the dreaded first trimester and finally announced to the rest of the world. I\u2019m an ultrasound technologist and know of all the shitty things that could still happen. But I let myself just be happy, enjoy my pregnancy, and not worry about everything else that could still go wrong.  \n\nNow we have our second trimester genetic testing and a week later we get a call from our OB. She said that our blood work came back showing that there was a 1 in 5 chance our baby had a genetic disorder. I immediately started balling and thought the worse. We schedule a level 2 ultrasound the following week at a MFM office. Prior to our ultrasound we meet with the genetic counselor and she told us about all the possible disorders and our choices. My husband and I discussed what we would want if our nightmare was reality and we knew for us, we couldn\u2019t let our baby suffer and would let her go if we had to.\n\nThe genetic counselor tells us that our baby girl is likely to have Trisomy 18 and can confirm with ultrasound. We go in for our ultrasound and I still kept thinking THEY were all wrong and our baby was okay. I naively thought this couldn\u2019t be happening to us and we would be the people to have a false positive. \n\nWe\u2019re getting our ultrasound and again I\u2019m just blinded by my own disbelief of what\u2019s really happening. I see the tech is having trouble getting the heart, head/brain, kidney, nose/lips, and feet/hands pictures she should be getting and I just think, wow she\u2019s not very good at this. And that\u2019s what I thought throughout this ultrasound. That\u2019s what I regret the most. Not being able to tell my husband that there is something extremely wrong and brace him for what\u2019s to come. She steps out and we wait for the MD to come in. He walks in with a straight face and starts scanning. That\u2019s when my life comes to a stand still. He says that there\u2019s extreme evidence to show our baby has Trisomy 18. My hurt just sank and I didn\u2019t even know what to feel.  \n\nThe next two weeks are spent getting an amniocentesis so that  we would know if we would have problems in our future pregnancies. And scheduling our D&amp;E. \n\nGetting through this last year has definitely been the hardest for my husband and I. We each went through our worst moments at different times and it took a toll on our marriage. We weren\u2019t communicating as much as we thought and we were trying to work through our feelings on our own. We had a CP in May and finally just started to tell each other exactly how we feel. Over the summer, we finally got back to being us. Enjoying ourselves and being happy again with it just being him and I. We stopped putting pressure on ourselves to be pregnant every month. Even though I still get sad sometimes when I start my period, we just go out for sushi, drinks, and/or enjoy adult candy. \n\nWe obviously still have days where we\u2019re just sad. But more recently I\u2019ve been able to talk about her or bring her up and not cry, but smile. I bring her up a lot more now and I don\u2019t care if it makes people uncomfortable because it brings me joy. She happened, she was wanted, and we love her and miss her so much.

Right now we call our LO \"Angel\" and I try to feel right about that, but I just know that wouldn't have been their name if I had carried them over to earthside. And I feel like the baby knows that, too, and it hurts their feelings. But, at the same time, these baby names were the first things my husband and I agreed on and to part with them would feel like giving up the only hope I have left, if that makes sense. \n\nI was never that entitled when I was expecting, but my grief has made me very entitled. And that's something I'm confronting and trying to work through. Which leads into the next two things.\n\nWhy oh WHY do they not have separate grieving places? If about 1 in 4 pregnancies end in loss why do I have to sit with enormously pregnant women, to be called back to an office with a baby development chart on the wall, to walk down a hallway with giant posterboards filled with hundreds of baby pictures? Now that I'm in a slightly better place, I feel happy for all the healthy babies and pregnancies. But at the time, when I was walking down a hallway to get an ultrasound of a baby without a beating heart, it was a little raw. And then to get the d and c procedure, you have the long trek past the table of diaper cakes and flowers and balloons, through the room with giant baby posters, and there's a man wearing a shirt that says \"DAD OF TWO GIRLS\" who's like the troll guarding the bridge to the rest of the worst day of my life. I'm GLAD you have not one but two girls, but my husband is here holding my hand and I feel like screaming at you to take your braggy shirt off.\n\nMy parents are happy because they get to go on a cruise for a very low price. That they booked the morning after my d and c. Which starts 10 days after my d and c. I messaged my dad telling him I was happy for him and he said, God works in mysterious ways. What? God took my baby, and then gave you a cruise? I don't understand. I know I am \"handling this well\", but I am your daughter. Did it not occur to you that I may need you in the first 10 DAYS after my miscarriage began, or did you simply not care? But more than anything, why didn't life stop for you, too? Why is my loss not even a blip on your map? Why isn't this your loss, too? Like I said, I am newly entitled.  \n\nI got the courage to thank the members of the group chat of friends who acknowledged our loss later in the day, and then the first person to post after me talked about their bowel movement. And I know this is my third entitled part in a row. But I was just miffed and shocked and wronged that life went on that fast for everyone else, when I have been stuck mentally wiping away that blood for the first time since it happened. But I'm stuck in the moments before that, too, because everything started and started to end in the same bathroom. But no, your BM is the next part of life and life has continued for you and my family and everyone and even me, and I can't make it stop even though it did for the baby.\n\nWhy does no one seem to tell you what to expect after a d and c? The nurse handed me a packet that said to come back if I had \"bright, red bleeding\" while bright, red bleeding had just moments previously spilled down my legs and puddled at my feet. In front of her. Seems like an oversight.\n\nDoes anyone else still feel like buying baby things? I picked out these stupid little Dalmatian onesies the week before I knew, and I think about them going out of season and not having them and somehow it hurts? Mostly I think about my sister-in-law having her newborn soon, and seeing him in those little onesies (entirely possible, we both love this brand) and feeling the loss all over again. I know it's stupid and even shallow to feel an attachment to onesies on top of all this, but somehow I do. \n\nEvery time I open a browser for the rest of my life, am I going to see these heartwrenching ads? My husband turned off my cookies, but the kicker is that all these miscarriage sites and stories I click on are from babycenter or netmums or something similar. What is that? I know it's unavoidable but why? I just ordered myself a pregnancy loss book off of Amazon and my \"sponsered books\" from the same page were all scrapbooks for baby's first year.

Some of you know that I recently miscarried identical twins conceived via my fourth IVF overall but my first donor one and we went for double donor. Although our infertility and RPL is unexplained we went for double donor to give us our best shot at eliminating anything that might be causing both our infertility (we caught pregnant naturally only three times in almost 8 years of timed intercourse) and our recurrent miscarriages (all three natural pregnancies and two assisted ones ended in chemical pregnancies). \n\nConceiving identicals from a single embryo transfer was a fairytale. The embryo was grade A expanded blast. \n\nI just yesterday got the results of testing on the twins and other POC and I was told the tests were very comprehensive. They found nothing at all wrong. The pregnancy tissue and placenta was all sound - no abnormal chorionic villi etc - and the twins were genetically fine - no chromosome abnormalities etc. The loss is completely unexplained. \n\nAlthough I haven\u2019t been found to have proper clotting disorders, high NK cells or low hormones I was nonetheless on a protocol to ensure any such issues were accounted for. My consultant says it wasn\u2019t me/my body and probably just the fact that they were identical twins that led to their demise. It\u2019s a high-risk pregnancy. He said if the embryo had never split, he expects I\u2019d be 18 weeks pregnant now.\n\nWe have one embryo left, but apparently it\u2019s grade C - much less likely to lead to viable pregnancy. And I have to wait to Jan/Feb as I only just stopped my withdrawal bleed and need my cycles back to normal plus a very long protocol.  We have another potential egg donor, but also found out yesterday her BMI is too high so that won\u2019t be happening anytime soon. It took 10 months from identifying our previous donor to egg collection so we\u2019re looking at least at a year, even she even does bring her BMI down and is otherwise suitable.\n\nMy close friend recently disclosed she\u2019s expecting her first on the day my twins were due, so I can\u2019t see her or several other friends/family members because their kids/pregnancies trigger me. I can\u2019t work because I\u2019m so traumatised and basically cry and scream all day in my pyjamas. I feel my whole life is shrinking and being destroyed and that it\u2019s only a matter of time before I drive my (wonderful) husband away too.\n \nI know it doesn\u2019t help to think this but I can\u2019t stop thinking \u2018why can\u2019t I just have my twins?\u2019. If there was nothing wrong with them, or with me, why did they have to die? Some identical twins are born alive so why couldn\u2019t that have been us?  I just feel like we\u2019ve rolled snake eyes repeatedly on what are supposedly unloaded dice. I tell myself that can\u2019t happen forever and one day we will at least roll a 4, 5 or 6 - if there are no underlying issues then one day it MUST work out and we have an embryo that makes it the full 9 months, but knowing our last embryo only has a 1 in 4 chance of even implanting is extinguishing my hope for them, so now I\u2019m having to think about a whole new double donor cycle. I\u2019m just so tired, and sad, and angry and in pain. I keep telling myself that in only another three years or so it will all be over and we\u2019ll have had a baby somehow or moved onto adoption. \n\nBut the thought of getting through those years and the work it\u2019s going to take just feels like torture. But not as much torture as giving up.\n\nSorry for the novel but I feel like I\u2019m dying the death of a thousand cuts and wanted to say so to people who will understand and not say trite things (by the way, I am medicated, seeing my GP fortnightly and a counsellor weekly). \n\nI know I have loads to be grateful for in my life but at the moment I\u2019d gladly give everything up to be pregnant again. I\u2019m so profoundly unhappy and afraid.

I'm having a really hard couple of weeks and it felt like time to come out of hiding. \n\nMy DH and I have been TTC since June of 2016 with no luck at all. We tried IUI in Sept '17, my husband gets routine SA's (his numbers are fine but not great), and all my testing has been fine. IUI failed and we just kept plugging along. We planned to do another IUI in April '18. Bought all the meds, made plans, etc.\n\nI found out I was pregnant via HPT on March 26, 2018. I will never, ever forget that feeling. I cried like a crazy person and screamed at my husband, \"Is this right? Does this look right to you?\" We both walked around in a stupor for the rest of the day. I kept taking tests every Monday for weeks after that to keep reminding myself that it was real. I was so anxious about it because it had taken so long to happen at all. \n\nWhen we went to the doctor for the first time, I should've been exactly 8 weeks. Our fetus was measuring about 2 weeks behind, but had a heartbeat. It was slow, but it was there. I honestly think this was when I lost part of myself. Not the MMC, not the pain of actually passing clots, but the knowledge that it was there. It was real, but it still wasn't going to happen for us. \n\nI went back in for a follow up about 5 days later. There was literally no change at all. Still measuring about 6 weeks. Slow heartbeat. Went back another 6 days later and it was gone. The stress of all the appointments had really gotten to me and, honestly, finding out there was no heartbeat felt like a relief. At least we had an answer. I opted for the misoprostal and didn't take any time off from work. I just wanted to move on.\n\nAbout 3 weeks after I found out I was pregnant, my best friend also became pregnant, after about 7 months of trying. She was SO excited to do this together and started imaging our showers and our kids being friends, etc. I was too anxious for my new OB appointment and indulged her but kept saying \"we'll see\". Sometimes it feels like I knew it wasn't going to be a thing. My friend just started her third trimester.\n\nIt's been a hard year, but I still had all those fertility drugs sitting in my fridge's crisper, waiting to be used. We just did another IUI in September of this year and found out last week that it didn't fucking work. My husband's numbers were way better this time. We had a different protocol. My follicles looked great. Fucking nothing. Period was perfectly, exactly on time. Like always.\n\nMy best friend is pregnant. Two of my friends just announced that they're pregnant with #2. I just...can't do this anymore? We're on 2 lists for upcoming IVF trials that are deeply discounted and I can't even muster any excitement for any part of it. I know you all know how hard this is, but I'm so tired. I don't even know how to properly mourn the idea of a kid that we had for about a month. My therapist and I laugh about how I like to bounce around the various stages of grief depending on the day. (It's been \"bargaining\", as of late.)\n\nI don't understand and I don't know what else to do. I bought myself a little Jizo statue and I'm working really hard to take comfort in that. I would've been due on 11/30, so my husband and I are taking a vacation for my birthday, but I have a hard time looking forward to anything. It's like any possible hope or good feeling or wish for the future has been beaten out of me. Sigh. Thank you for reading. I just wanted to get this off my chest.

At my 8w appointment the baby had a heartbeat but was too small. At 9w they confirmed that there was no heartbeat and I induced the miscarriage with misoprostol. That was pretty rough, but I am glad I did it that way since it provided some closure (closure by way of harrowing experience, I guess).\n\nIn the overall scheme of things, I know that I am really lucky. I got pregnant naturally on our second try, despite being 34 (me) and 40 (husband) and overweight. There weren\u2019t any complications from the miscarriage and my doctor told me there wasn\u2019t anything that I could have done. There\u2019s nothing going on with me physically (besides weight) that can impact my fertility.\n\nBut, at the end of the day, even acknowledging all the luck I\u2019ve had, the outcome is the same: I won\u2019t be having a baby in January and I\u2019m starting over. We\u2019ve been trying for two cycles now and my period is a bit chaotic: not as regular as before and 100x more painful. This has made it difficult (so far) to get pregnant again.\n\nAfter the miscarriage I grieved openly and publicly because I wanted people to know what it was like and that it was a normal part of life that was nothing to be ashamed of. I also \u201cgot better\u201d publicly too, and now I think everyone else thinks I am \u201cover it.\u201d \n\nAnd, for a little bit, I was.

They both have been very sensitive and supportive, but right now it feels like a big party I didn\u2019t get invited to (or more accurately, got invited to and then my invite was rescinded).\n\nSo anyway, that\u2019s me.

My chances of miscarriage go up with every additional age over advanced maternal age. My eggs will go to shit, if they aren't already shit. I don't want to wait. \n\nBut, when I talk to him about it, he literally has a panic attack. His chest gets tight, his eyes water up, he gets angry and upset. He likes the pace of our family right now. He likes that he can stay up until 2am and game on his computer and not have to worry about a baby waking up. He doesn't want to be inconvenienced again. \n\nHe also is afraid of legit things (because I think the above things are entirely selfish), such as me suffering from postpartum depression again, our baby having a CHD like our last kid, our pregnancy being high risk like our last pregnancy, having another high-needs baby like our toy boys, and having a baby who hates him (which, unfortunately, our youngest son legitimately \"hated\" my husband until he was almost one year old, which contributed to my PPD).\n\nMeanwhile, I am over here feeling empty and scared that I will have to live the rest of my life with this emptiness inside of me. My clock is ticking away. My history of infertility is stacked up against me. Every day I think about this baby I might not ever have, and it sucks the joy out of almost everything. \n\nI don't know what I want from this. I do go to regular therapy (I suffer from MDD and PTSD in the first place), my husband and I are in counseling and have been for many years. We have an appointment next week. \n\nI just feel so alone in my grief, and it looks like my grief will never have an end in sight.", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "ttcafterloss", "subreddit_id": "t5_34scd", "subreddit_subscribers": 3929, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Intro: Chemical MC of surprise baby in August.

It had been 5 months since my ectopic pregnancy, removal of my right fallopian tube and the loss of my baby.. It was an unplanned pregnancy but I wanted every second of it from the moment I found out.\n\nIt has been a long road to recovery. At first I thought I would never try again, for fear of going through that trauma again. Women have it so tough when it comes to childbearing. And when you have experienced a loss it changes everything...it's this crazy amount of fear, but simultaneous intensified desire to have children. At least that's how I experienced it.\n\nAnyways, last month I decided I was ready to try. We had sex exactly when I thought we should, a few times (on different days) to be sure. I guess it was me kind of being in denial that it would work out right away. My cycle came today and I couldn't help but cry. I had high hopes that it would work out.\n\nI am feeling the pain of so many women out there who are in the boat of trying to conceive actively. It is NOT easy by any means. When it doesn't work out, you have the feeling of emotion from your cycle itself, plus the reminder of what isn't and then the kind of dreams of what could be going down the drain feeling...\n\nI know it is going to be more difficult for me to conceive now, with having only one fallopian tube. Are there any women out there who have conceived after an ectopic with one tube and had a healthy pregnancy? Or any women in general who have been through this more than once or too many times to count that could offer support? I'm just feeling discouraged and sad but I don't want to give up hope.

I'm 35 with DOR. Friday I found out my first pregnancy is over. I agreed to a d&amp;c for this week but it hasn't been scheduled yet. I was an emotional wreck when I found out and didn't ask any questions. I wont see the doctor until the procedure so id like to ask a few questions about your experiences that I didn't really see covered in another thread. \n\nFirst of all, I'm currently taking hormones, progesterone and estrodiol. I was told I could stop taking them Monday and nothing else was mentioned. Im assuming medically that wont cause any problems but what about emotionally? I'm quite sensitive to hormones and I'm recovering from anxiety that's always been worse when pmsing. Does suddenly quiting hormones or even just after a MC cause crazy hormones and emotions? I just want to be prepared.\n\nI've had small surgeries before so I'm not worried about that, besides the emotional toll, but what about recovery. Ill be trying to conceive again as soon as possible because of DOR. Ive read that a lot of people were mobile pretty quickly after, but took a few days off. My doc said I should be physically fine to go to work the next day, emotionally however not so much. I will have to go to work the next day though as I've already had too much time off (was on bed rest for the past two weeks bc of a subchorionic hematoma before my loss).

I had a missed miscarriage discovered September 4, was supposed to be 8 weeks but baby was measuring 6+4 or 5, no heartbeat. Had an emotionally traumatic d&amp;c September 8. My hcg has been slow to taper off, was 448 almost 4 weeks after the procedure and down to 30 this past week. In follow up ultrasounds I was diagnosed with something called enhanced myometrial vascularity, also called AVM\u2014 basically a tangle of veins and arteries that shouldn\u2019t be there and could be very dangerous if they rupture; I could hemorrhage. They also saw a small piece of what they guess is retained placenta. Jackpot! Then when I returned for an additional follow up last week, they \u201cthink\u201d the avm is getting better, but the small piece of placenta is still there. \n\nSo now I have a few questions:\n1. Has anyone had experience with retained placenta 5 weeks after d&amp;c? They want me to follow up in a week or two but truthfully I find that place so deeply upsetting (every time I go in they ask when I delivered, waiting room filled with happy pregnant ladies and their partners) and I don\u2019t want to go back. \n2.

Time stood still. \n5 times I danced to that positive test. 5 times I dreamed of the life that could be. 5 times I learned I was not going to be the mom I wanted to be. \nThose losses changed me, shaped me to who I am. I know I am more bitter than I was. I know I do not think about pregnancy and babies the way I used to. It caused tension between friends when they couldn\u2019t understand why I didn\u2019t just \u201cget over it\u201d. \n\nHow does one describe the daily anxiety, the nauseous feeling that sits right between my breasts, the weight that seems to creep up my throat in a strangling hold? How does one describe the depression that sits at the pit of your stomach, that comes up every time you think of pregnancy, miscarriage, or family. Anything can remind you of these things, remind you of your pregnancies and losses. \nOne miscarriage makes you feel horrible, lost, confused, alone. By the fourth you're just numb. Oh sure you're still excited every time you see that positive test, can't help but dream of the life you will have... But it becomes just another number. 5th pregnancy, 6th week, 4th miscarriage, cycle 5, no period for 6 weeks. All just numbers. \nAnd the idea that, after adding up all the pregnancies and how far along each was... the idea that had it been one pregnancy... I could have known if it was a boy or a girl. Had it been one pregnancy, my baby would be x days/weeks/months/years old. \nBut how do you describe these feelings? How do you explain to someone who has never been through it, what it feels like when you see your friends or family, pregnant or with a new baby. That every time someone asks \"when are you going to try?\", as if you weren't trying already! That every time someone asks, it tears your heart a little but more. You see women happily pregnant, or worse, not wanting to be pregnant, and you die a little more inside because you so badly want that to be you.\nHow can all that be explained? The grief never leaves. It's a weight you carry with you, always. People will say, just don't think about that... don't remember that on this day, a year, or two ago, I lost my 1st, 2nd, 3rd baby... How can I forget?! Those were the days my world crashed around me... the days a portion of my dreams died. I want so much to be blind to the dates, oblivious to the amount of time that has passed that I have gone without that wonderful baby in my tummy, my arms... my life. \nI go on living with this pain. I was told I have a bad attitude...i was called negative. But this is who I am. Every loss has turned me into the person I am today. I am not afraid to speak of my losses, but I don't say how much each loss hurt.\n\nAnd then it happened again. September 2017, that second line appeared. I knew the drill: start progesterone and baby aspirine, blood work every two days, early ultrasound to see if maybe, maybe!!, this one would stick. Second bloodwork came back and it didn\u2019t double.  I had an anxiety filled week waiting to miscarry until I had my ultrasound. And that\u2019s when my doctor and I found my double rainbow, my twins. \nI had a very easy pregnancy physically, or as easy as any twin pregnancy can be. But let me tell you it was the hardest nine months of my life. \nI asked my doctor, \u201cat what point do I come to the hospital if I\u2019m bleeding? When can you save them?\u201d Because I knew there was nothing to be done if I lost them before a certain point. And even once I hit the \u201cage of viability\u201d my anxiety didn\u2019t decrease. Between my monthly ultrasounds I was a wreck. I tried to schedule my GP appointments between my ultrasounds so I could hear their heartbeats on the Doppler. But even then, every twinge or pang sent my running to the bathroom convinced this was it. I was going to lose them. \n\n\nI am not here to tell you that because I found my rainbow you\u2019ll find yours. I am here to say that you are not alone in your storm. One question I\u2019ve heard a lot is: how do you enjoy a pregnancy after miscarriage? My answer: celebrate. Celebrate that plus sign, celebrate the nausea and morning sickness and all the other wonderfully horrible symptoms that come along with pregnancy. Celebrate it as long as it lasts. Because if you don\u2019t, and you make it to the finish line without celebrating everything before, are you going to be disappointed? I know I would have been. \nWhen it came time to finally have my twins via c section, I asked my doctor to tie my tubes. People questioned me, but my doctor didn\u2019t. Because I knew, when the number didn\u2019t double at the beginning, I knew then that I couldn\u2019t do it. 6 pregnancies was enough for me. I didn\u2019t need any more numbers. \n\nSo carry your babies with you in your hearts. And next time you\u2019re pregnant, if there is a next time for you, celebrate it, and celebrate your angels that came before.

I am in LA for a conference, and yesterday flew by, but I wanted to say something. I know that the Reddits I am subscribed to were blowing up yesterday, and I didn\u2019t really get to read much. So here is what I wrote right before going to bed. \n\nToday is something that I wish I didn't know about. Today is National Pregnancy and Infant Loss Remembrance Day. I have not have one, but two miscarriages in the last year. I just passed what should have been the due date of my first pregnancy. I didn't even look to see the due date of the second because it was a chemical pregnancy that I technically shouldn't have even noticed. September 30th was my due date. It was hard, but it was okay. I accepted it, I acknowledged it and I did everything I could to get through it. I am the only person (besides Brian of course) in my life who will ever put significance on that day, which is okay. \n\nI am not the only person I know who has had a miscarriage. Miscarriage or pregnancy loss is not uncommon, it happens A LOT... 1 in 4 women have one. I have researched so much it hurts. Why me? What did I do.. or didn't do? There is no answer. My doctor pulled Brian and I in to her office and the first thing she asked was, \"Are you okay?\" looking at me directly. I wanted to say, \"No... I lost my Mom and I lost two babies.. who in their right mind would be OK?\" but I said, \"I think so... I mean I function....\" She was really seeing if I had  depression. I wouldn't put myself in that category though. We did all the RPL (repeat pregnancy loss) testing we could. Thankfully my doctor took a missed miscarriage and a chemical pregnancy all within 6 months of each other as abnormal. She warned us that there was an 80%-90% of the tests coming out normal. Most doctors wouldn't even acknowledge you until you have had 3 (or more) losses; which lets be honest... thats crap! After all the testing of course Brian and I are perfectly healthy. Nothing is wrong. So we are still left with the why. Which they always say your baby most likely had genetic abnormalities.\n\nThis is just a small part of my story. I am not special. I am just speaking up. Out of the 30 years on earth I only knew one couple who had experienced pregnancy loss. So for me... I was alone. Miscarriage comes in many different forms and happens every single day. I have found communities online that have helped me learn so much more about miscarriage, the emotions that come with it and encourage to keep trying. Just remember the next time you want to ask someone who they are having kids or if they started trying yet, that its not the best thing to ask. You never know where someone is on their journey. I myself think its okay to talk about it. I find it helpful to talk and think people need to be aware that you are hurt by this. Pregnancy is easy for some, but others not so much; again... I am not special. \u2764\ufe0f", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "ttcafterloss", "subreddit_id": "t5_34scd", "subreddit_subscribers": 3938, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "FB Post I Wrote Yesterday", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/ttcafterloss/comments/9ontul/fb_post_i_wrote_yesterday/"}, {"author": "EvaPurrrron", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_22qgu0xj", "author_patreon_flair": false, "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1539704640, "domain": "self.ttcafterloss", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/ttcafterloss/comments/9oosz3/im_having_an_early_miscarriage/", "gildings": {"gid_1": 0, "gid_2": 0, "gid_3": 0}, "id": "9oosz3", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 2, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/ttcafterloss/comments/9oosz3/im_having_an_early_miscarriage/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1539704641, "score": 1, "selftext": "Approximately a week and a half after finding out I was pregnant, I started bleeding like a stuffed pig.

I've had the recurrent loss testing done and everything is normal.  My diagnosis is unexplained recurrent pregnancy loss.  I should note that I have a 3 year old, who was conceived with no issues.  \n\nMy first RE recommended we go straight to IVF with PGS.  I went for a second opinion to another RE and she said she didn't know if she would recommend that course, because since all of my testing is normal, even with PGS testing, the same thing could happen again.  We are waiting for results from my husband's karyotype.  She also said she wants look at my uterine lining next cycle, a week after ovulation.  However, if there is an issue with my lining, it's hard to deal with unless you do IVF.  \n\nOverall, I like this RE better than my first but I came away feeling pretty discouraged.  It seemed like she wasn't confident that I would ever have another term pregnancy, even if we did IVF (which honestly I'd like to avoid).  Maybe that's how she has to act, but damn, it sucked.  My first RE gave me a handout (lol) on recurrent loss which said that the likelihood of a healthy pregnancy was still high even if you had previous losses (especially when there is no explanation for the losses, like here).  My previous thought process had been that I would eventually get the healthy pregnancy, it just might take a few more losses, but now I've started to think more about the fact that we might not have another.\n\nI took this month off from trying.  I have been working with an acupuncturist since last spring (after my first loss but before my others).  She says that I have a liver and spleen deficiency and that my body is depleted from stress.  I've been seeing her pretty consistently and took some herbs that she prescribed this past month.  No idea if that will do anything, but I guess we will see.  \n\nOK, that was a lot.

It went well, and I woke up crying. The male nurse I woke up to told me he was sorry and he\u2019d been here before. That was comforting to hear, but I also told him I\u2019m sorry for him. I felt fine until I got in the car to go home. Within a minute I was not feeling right, I started blacking out, my hands went numb, I thought I\u2019d puke, and I passed out. I woke up to my husband yelling my name while driving in a panic and literally sweating on my forehead. Since then I\u2019ve been in bed and gotten up once to change my pad.\n\nSo this morning was quite a stressful one. To start, I am NEVER impatient and ALWAYS understand. I was raised to always put others first, I\u2019m nice to the general public and very empathetic. Well, I was having none of that this morning. Here\u2019s the story...\n\nOur water was shut off today...\n\nI woke up at 9:20 to take a shower with antibacterial soap like they told me to. Had to be at Lakeview for 10. The water wouldn't turn on. John said there's someone outside at the neighbors and they must be at our house now. I go out to poke my head outside the door since I already stripped my clothes and there's a guy digging in our water ground thing. He shut the freaking water off to work on our house, didn't even knock to let us know. Never has that ever happened in the two years we've lived here.\n\nSo I yelled at him and called him a dick head. I know, not my best moment but I was in a freaking rage.\n\nI was about to go back out there and tell him all my life story about how today is literally the worst day and time to do that to me. Then the water was turned on in 5 min. He quoted us 10. I guess he hurried. Bet he has a story to tell today lol\n\nI went off on my husband too that he needed to go make that guy turn it back on now. Then I told him don't worry about it, I can handle myself.
