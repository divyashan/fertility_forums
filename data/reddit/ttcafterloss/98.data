My first miscarriage was at 5.5 weeks with my first ever pregnancy in June of 2019. I was pregnant again by August 2019 and went in for a 9 week ultrasound to find a missed miscarriage. The baby had stopped developing at 5.5 weeks but my body continued to produce hormones and did not miscarry on its own. I had a d and c in September of 2019. After this I had testing done on my thyroid and the mthfr mutation, all came back normal. We had genetic testing done on what would have been our baby boy and everything came back normal. My OB and I decided that in my next pregnancy I would try baby asprin, oral progesterone, and Prednisone. I was pregnant again in December of 2019 and miscarried at 7.5 weeks in January of 2020- so this approach failed. I started seeing a fertility specialist, started yoga and accupuncture. We got genetic karotype testing which came back normal for both my husband and myself. We went through much more testing and a hysteroscopy (uterus was found normal) and found that my blood antibody levels qualified me for an autoimmune blood clotting disorder called antiphospholipid syndrome. This can be treated with lovenox blood thinning injections. I took a little time off and got pregnant again in April 2020 but it was a chemical pregnancy that quickly ended around 4 weeks. I was pregnant again in June and started the lovenox injections along with the baby asprin, progesterone, and Prednisone. The baby had a strong heartbeat at 7 weeks and all was looking good but when I  went on for a 9 week ultrasound and there was no heartbeat. The doctors have absolutely no idea what happened as the baby seemed healthy and all looked promising.

We lost our baby at 16 weeks in October. We have been trying to conceive again since March with no luck. My husband recently told me one of his childhood friends is pregnant (from what I know it is unplanned) and that she had to lie to her boyfriend's family that they were married to cover for the pre-marital sex they were having. Whatever, not really my problem.  \n\nFast forward to today when my mother-in-law texts me asking if she can host a party at my house.  I'm generally up for this, but I text my husband to ask him his thoughts and see if he's okay with it. Based on the dates she is asking I'm assuming it's for her birthday. My husband messages me back after he talks to her and it sounds like she wants to have a joint birthday for her and my husband's childhood friend (she is a very close friend of the family and their birthdays are close together) that would also serve as a mini celebration for her pregnancy. I am floored by this. \n\nI just can't understand why somebody wouldn't get the sensitivity around asking me to host a baby shower (okay so not a full blown baby shower, but a pregnancy celebration of some kind) for an unplanned pregnancy after I lost my very much planned and very much wanted pregnancy last year. I'm not saying her baby isn't wanted at this point and wouldn't be loved very much, it just feels like salt in the wound to ask me to host anything. The fact that my mother-in-law didn't disclose that this would also be some type of pregnancy celebration up front is even more frustrating. What if I would have agreed to host the party here then found out later it was supposed to be a pregnancy party? I just don't understand how people don't know how painful this is. \n\nMy husband is going to talk to his mom about this but I am just so hurt and upset that anybody would think it was okay to even ask us to do this. She is such a kind person and I know she doesn't mean anything by it but our loss is so incredibly painful and I just don't get how she didn't think about that.  Ugh.

I would wake at 2 or 3 in the morning and not be able to get back to sleep. After my loss I still have this issue although not severe. I wake instead between 5-6am now. Basically I cannot seem to manage to get more than 6-6.5 hours of sleep a night. \n\nI've been doing CBT-I (cognitive behavorial therapy for insomnia) with the VA so for right now my weekly sleep assignment is to go to bed at 10:45pm and get up at 6am. I have zero issues going to bed at a certain time or falling asleep. I sleep through the night but without fail I can't sleep till 6am. It doesn't matter when I go to sleep I will not manage to get 7 hours of sleep. No matter what when I wake-up my heart is pounding. I think it's a big reason I can't manage to get back to sleep after waking too early. My mind starts going and my heart is pumping hard. \n\nI've done all the good sleep hygiene things too: No electronics/TV an hour before bed, I dim the lights, we got blackout blinds, I sleep with an eye blind and eat plugs, I make sure the room is chilly, I don't stay in bed if I'm not sleep etc. I use blue light blocking glasses. I try not to drink or eat before bed. I've tried melatonin. It's had zero effect for me. \n\nAnyway, has anyone dealt with this kind of a sleep issue and did you find anything that helped? One of the things I find frustrating is that most sleep medications negatively impact fertility and while I do not like pharmaceuticals I'm at a point where I'd be willing to try them but of course since we are TTC there's literally no medication I can take. I've been considering asking my doctor about Zoloft. Figuring maybe possibly I have PTSD/PMDD or something that may be eased by something. I definitely feel like I suffer more emotionally during my luteal phase but to be honest the sleep problem is every phase.", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "ttcafterloss", "subreddit_id": "t5_34scd", "subreddit_subscribers": 7955, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Does anyone have experience or advice regarding Insomnia?", "total_awards_received": 0, "treatment_tags": [], "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/ttcafterloss/comments/i5dra8/does_anyone_have_experience_or_advice_regarding/", "whitelist_status": "no_ads", "wls": 0}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": true, "author": "anonxyzk", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_6a1j434q", "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_premium": false, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1596809732, "domain": "self.ttcafterloss", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/ttcafterloss/comments/i5ekqb/suggestions_to_help_get_through_bad_days/", "gildings": {}, "id": "i5ekqb", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 0, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "parent_whitelist_status": "no_ads", "permalink": "/r/ttcafterloss/comments/i5ekqb/suggestions_to_help_get_through_bad_days/", "pinned": false, "pwls": 0, "retrieved_on": 1596809743, "score": 1, "selftext": "Hi everyone, I just wanted to share something that has helped me.

Sorry in advance for the long post.\n\nMy first two periods after my loss in April seemed normal.  However, last cycle (3rd) my period was quite light - I bled for about four-five days in total, but amounts were light-medium during that time, and I never had a heavy bleed which is what is normal for me.  I wrote this off to that cycle being very stressful.  I felt much calmer during the 4th cycle, and thought that if I did have a period, I'd be sure to return to my 'normal' as per the first two.  \n\nMy period started properly yesterday (today is CD2 of cycle 5) and although I had a really good heavy bleed at first (one pad very full), today I've woken up to practically nothing on my pad.  This is the same thing that happened during the 3rd cycle in that I would not bleed overnight and then during the day, I'd just not seem to pass that much.  This is not how things used to be pre-loss, or in the first two cycles in that my heaviest bleeds would be overnight (I'd wake up and my pad would be soaked).  I'm worried this cycle will turn out the same. \n\nSo, first question: **Could this just be the new normal, or is it possible for problems to emerge after you have had normal periods?**  I had surgery for my loss which was my first pregnancy, but my understanding was that any scarring/blocking is normally apparent quite early on.  There wouldn't appear to be any (significant) blockage to my cervix in that blood is able to escape, but could I have adhesions that are reducing the quality of my lining?  I had an u/s about three weeks' after my surgery, and all appeared to be good with a trilaminar stripe.  I'm also aware that the amount of bleeding doesn't necessary have any connection to lining quality, so it could just be the way things are now.  Periods are still regular and I appear by all intens and purposes to be ovulating.  \n\nSecond question: We are going to keep trying for two more months (six cycles), and then have a break for two months, so I figured that's a good time to schedule in some elective procedures if we get there.  **What would you advise I look into if we haven't had success by then?**  Please note I live in a country where healthcare is public, so I would be seeking these things privately.  \n\nMy initial plan is to approach my GP and see if they can offer me anything (probably not, but if I do get anything at this stage it would likely be hormonal tests), maybe get another u/s at the mid-point of my cycle, then to seek a private hysteroscopy (HS) and/or hysterosalpingography (HSG).  **Which of the latter two do you think would be best, or do you think there is another surgical procedure that would be better?**  My husband had a semen analysis 12 months ago, and everything was normal - I'd be happy to rule this factor out seeing as we were able to achieve the loss quite quickly.  I'm mainly concerned something might have happened to me post-surgery.\n\nThank you for your time xx", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "ttcafterloss", "subreddit_id": "t5_34scd", "subreddit_subscribers": 7981, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Period changes after loss and next steps?", "total_awards_received": 0, "treatment_tags": [], "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/ttcafterloss/comments/i6zv8f/period_changes_after_loss_and_next_steps/", "whitelist_status": "no_ads", "wls": 0}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "iwannabeathogwarts", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_53cve22y", "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_premium": false, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1597042777, "domain": "self.ttcafterloss", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/ttcafterloss/comments/i701sw/wasnt_meant_to_be_i_guess_mild_rantsorry/", "gildings": {}, "id": "i701sw", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_css_class": "trigger", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_template_id": "7465d7b8-7120-11e4-9568-12313d14791d", "link_flair_text": "Trigger - MC", "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 3, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "parent_whitelist_status": "no_ads", "permalink": "/r/ttcafterloss/comments/i701sw/wasnt_meant_to_be_i_guess_mild_rantsorry/", "pinned": false, "pwls": 0, "retrieved_on": 1597042788, "score": 1, "selftext": "Aaaand I'm back in the building.

And if there is someone with irregular or extra long cycles pleeease comment I have so many questions..", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "ttcafterloss", "subreddit_id": "t5_34scd", "subreddit_subscribers": 7987, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "So many questions, anyone here with irregular cycles?", "total_awards_received": 0, "treatment_tags": [], "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/ttcafterloss/comments/i74mn7/so_many_questions_anyone_here_with_irregular/", "whitelist_status": "no_ads", "wls": 0}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "LittleStitous33", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_4cipjs8q", "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_premium": false, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1597070074, "domain": "self.ttcafterloss", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/ttcafterloss/comments/i75xei/today_is_just_a_rough_day/", "gildings": {}, "id": "i75xei", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 15, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "parent_whitelist_status": "no_ads", "permalink": "/r/ttcafterloss/comments/i75xei/today_is_just_a_rough_day/", "pinned": false, "pwls": 0, "retrieved_on": 1597070085, "score": 1, "selftext": "It is first cycle after my CP, and i was really hoping it would happen right away.

He was born extremely prematurely when I had a placental abruption at 23 weeks gestation.

I'm in therapy and trying a new therapeutic medical treatment, and have been working through a lot of my guilt and fear. A huge part of me is just desperate to be pregnant again, which I feel incredibly guilty about. I also know that it would be dangerous to get pregnant again too soon \u2014 I had a classical C-section. I know  I need to wait at least six months (which would be October), but that an 18-month wait is recommended.\n\nI want my next pregnancy to be as safe as humanly possible, so of course I'm not trying to rush \u2014 but the thoughts of wanting to be pregnant again are incredibly high. I think part of the issue is that many of my close friends were due at the same time as me and are now having their babies. My due date is a week from today. I'm sure that given all of that, it makes sense that mentally, I'm having trouble accepting I'm not going to have a newborn anytime soon. \n\nAnyway, I guess I'm just curious if anyone in a similar situation to me struggled with this, and if so, how you handled it? It's bizarre to me, because as I've posted here before, the thought of being pregnant again is also incredibly terrifying.\n\nRegardless, thanks for reading and being a safe space to vent.

First I\u2019m sorry you all have to be here too,  it\u2019s heartbreaking. I\u2019m trying to be hopeful about ttc again and would like to hear others\u2019 experiences about when you ovulated after taking misoprostol? Quick timeline of my experience so far:\n7/4- found out I was pregnant\n\n7/28 - first ultrasound, should\u2019ve been 7w3d and it was an empty sac. A blighted ovum I\u2019m told. Doc gives me the option to wait to miscarry naturally, d&amp;c, or take pills to speed up the process. I chose the pills. Hcg blood draw was 3,110\n\n7/29 - took misoprostol in the morning. Bled all day and for the next 3 or 4 days then it stopped. I definitely saw when I passed the sac on 7/30, man that was the most traumatic thing I\u2019ve seen.\n\n8/6 - follow up ultrasound showed I had pretty much passed everything, still a small blood clot in there that doc wasn\u2019t worried about. Hcg level was at 48\n\nNow today (8/10) I\u2019m noticing cm the way it usually is a few days before I ovulate. Started opk testing and it\u2019s light so I know at least it\u2019s not falsely picking up hcg that could be lingering. If I counted the day I took miso and started bleeding as cd1 then today would be cd13. I\u2019m pretty consistent pre-miscarriage ovulating around cd15-cd17. \n\nWhether it\u2019s positive or negative I\u2019d love to hear your experience about how soon you ovulated after your mc. I know there are other posts about it but somehow putting this all in writing helps me grieve so thanks if you\u2019ve read this far.", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "ttcafterloss", "subreddit_id": "t5_34scd", "subreddit_subscribers": 7995, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Ovulation after miso", "total_awards_received": 0, "treatment_tags": [], "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/ttcafterloss/comments/i7d56d/ovulation_after_miso/", "whitelist_status": "no_ads", "wls": 0}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "LoveViper", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_template_id": "b22615aa-711f-11e4-97ba-12313b0e92a7", "author_flair_text": "38week term stillbirth_Lilly Ann\ud83d\udc95, 6\u202222\u202220\ud83d\udc94", "author_flair_text_color": "dark", "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_6631r", "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_premium": false, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1597093498, "domain": "self.ttcafterloss", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/ttcafterloss/comments/i7dlz7/went_back_to_work_today_had_a_meltdown_on_the_way/", "gildings": {}, "id": "i7dlz7", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_css_class": "support", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_template_id": "0b925822-beed-11e4-97e6-22000b3c81cc", "link_flair_text": "Support", "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 15, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "parent_whitelist_status": "no_ads", "permalink": "/r/ttcafterloss/comments/i7dlz7/went_back_to_work_today_had_a_meltdown_on_the_way/", "pinned": false, "pwls": 0, "retrieved_on": 1597093509, "score": 1, "selftext": "I work in childcare specifically with infants \nMy daughter was born still at 38 weeks on June 22nd (7weeks ago) \nToday was my first day back to work and it was SO HARD.. we had two new babies start today as well and I absolutely struggled to keep it together.
