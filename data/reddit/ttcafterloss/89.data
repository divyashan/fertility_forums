There was never a baby, just a sac, so I was surprised at how much I was bleeding. They had to do a blood transfusion and an emergency D&amp;C. \n\nAfter the D&amp;C, I\u2019ve continued to bleed for the next week. I would call it similar to a light period or spotting. I never even used a pad for it.\n\nThen last night, we came home from church, had just had dinner, and I was walking to the kitchen when I felt a sudden gush.\n\nI went to the bathroom and blood was just pouring out. I grabbed one of the adult diapers I had left over and it filled pretty much immediately.\n\nSo we went to the ER. But we waited for a couple of hours and it seemed like we would be there all night. My bleeding had already slowed way down. After the initial gush of blood, it went right back to my new normal of a light period. So we left.\n\nLast night, I woke up to a clean pad. But as I started walking around throughout the morning, I did start bleeding again and at one point there was a clot. But again, it\u2019s still pretty much my normal at this point.\n\nMy brother in law works at the hospital and got my charts for me. He said everything looks good from last night and he doesn\u2019t see any reason to panic. My husband just switched jobs and we won\u2019t have insurance until Monday.

I\u2019m new to this group. I just lost my first baby two days ago and am heavily grieving. It\u2019s is a tragedy. My miscarriage experience was so traumatic, I couldn\u2019t find similar stories online and was wondering if anyone in this group experienced what I did. I guess I\u2019m looking to feel normal, which is probably impossible. I\u2019m also RH negative if that\u2019s means anything...\n\nIt all started with light spotting, got an ultrasound and it got worse...got another ultrasound and the baby was fine but they asked to do a vaginal\nUltrasound to see more and I said yes which I now deeply regret. After the vagina ultrasound they detected a heart beat but I started bleeding even heavier accompanied by cramps which i did not have before. The next day, I got the most intense cramps I have ever felt in my entire life, fell on the bathroom floor screaming in pain, started having a panic attack, my entire body went numb and I couldn\u2019t move. My husband had to call an ambulance because I thought I was going to die since I was passing out. They carried me out of the house and took me to the hospital. This pain lasted for about an hour and then stopped. I felt like I had a pool of blood in my pants and went to the washroom to try and clean up. When I pulled down my pants, my baby, in full, came out and on to my underwear with the placenta wrapped around them. There wasn\u2019t even any blood... my child and the placenta were clean tissue and the blood came after when I went to the bathroom and have had spotting ever since. The nurse took my baby and left the room. It was awful. Has anyone had a miscarriage like that? Contractions and then the baby coming out in full at 7 weeks with no blood...? Is something wrong with me? Most of the stories I read, mothers bleed the baby out in pieces and it\u2019s a serious of events... \n\nOn another note, I swear getting a vaginal ultrasound made things worse. I started looking things up because of my experience and here are some articles about ultrasounds that I think you all should take a look at. It\u2019s seriously eye opening and I will never get a vaginal\nUltrasound again or a regular ultrasound before the second trimester.\n\nhttps://midwiferytoday.com/mt-articles/ultrasound-weighing-propaganda-facts/\n\nhttps://sarahbuckley.com/ultrasound-scans-cause-for-concern/\n\nhttps://community.babycenter.com/post/a29334863/miscarriage_after_vaginal_ultrasound\n\nI\u2019m also sorry for everyone in this group who has had to go through this.

The line that was so different from my first pregnancy, which was dark from the start. It was a weird cycle to begin with. I thought there was no way I was pregnant. 5 tests later, we accepted that it was true. We got pregnant again on the first try. We were so excited. But it felt different. I found myself taking a pregnancy test every morning to make sure I was actually pregnant. A week after the positive I had some spotting. Normal, some would say. I kept taking tests. A week after that we got into see my ob and he told me that he couldn\u2019t confirm via pelvic exam that I was, indeed, pregnant. He sent my to get my betas checked. The first time there was no question. In fact, he sent me for a dating scan right away because he thought it was twins or that I was farther along than I said. Again, so different.\n\nMy results came back. I was definitely pregnant, but my levels were lower than expected. Another beta two days later. Levels rose at a VERY borderline rate. I knew something was wrong. I convinced my husband to go to the ER that night. They did an abdominal and transvaginal ultrasound and checked my betas again. Hcg dropped from the morning and they could only see the gestational sac, but nothing else. My ob recommended another blood test two days later. Levels rose slightly. Let\u2019s do one more to be safe. And another ultrasound. Levels rose 25% and ultrasound confirmed that nothing ever formed after the fertilized egg implanted. I was not having a baby. \n\nIn the span of 3 weeks I went from being over the moon about being pregnant again, to having the worst week of my life. I knew something was wrong. I had no control. Three weeks after we got the faint positive, I had a d&amp;c to rid my body of what failed to develop into a viable embryo.\n\nI feel bad for feeling bad. I already have a beautiful baby. I haven\u2019t suffered multiple losses. We never saw a heartbeat. There are so many women who have it so much worse than I do. But I can\u2019t stop obsessing over when I can get pregnant again.

The pregnancy was unplanned but once I found out, very much wanted. At 6 weeks 1 day (according to the ultrasound) I went to the ER because something just didn't feel right. I had my first ultrasound done and saw the heartbeat, was told I had a small subchorionic hematoma and placed on partial bed rest until my first schedule ultrasound 11 days later. Unfortunately, that ultrasound showed no heartbeat and baby was measuring 6 weeks 1 day still. I waited a week and got a second opinion, before ultimately getting a D and C several weeks later (my body couldn't recognize the miscarriage). We ended up getting back together months later, but were really in no position to be trying for a baby (I was a full-time student and working full-time, barely managing to pay my bills). \n\nFast forward 4.5 years, we started ttc last month. At first, just being in a position to try restored a lot of hope for me. Having a baby will never replace the child we lost, but of course the thought of being pregnant again is exciting (and terrifying). However, last month it appears I had a chemical pregnancy. I'm still bleeding, HCG was down to 1 as of a few days ago, and now confused by a positive OPK (perhaps I should just stop peeing on stick for a while)\n\nI'm now a PhD student and while I'm confident I am at a place in my life to handle a pregnancy and child, I'm not sure how well I can handle another loss. BUT I know stress is no good for ttc! So, instead of spending my time obsessing in unhealthy ways, I'm trying to direct that energy toward good (i.e. help my SO quit smoking, vitamins, yoga/meditation, cooking more healthy meals, etc). I imagine that if I do get pregnant, I will need to continue habits like this to get through the nine months\n\nPraying for good news soon, for everyone here on the TTCAL board.", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "ttcafterloss", "subreddit_id": "t5_34scd", "subreddit_subscribers": 6785, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Introductions", "total_awards_received": 0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/ttcafterloss/comments/exu0br/introductions/"}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "mikaila16", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_4hber9us", "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_premium": false, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1580685602, "domain": "self.ttcafterloss", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/ttcafterloss/comments/exxbos/question/", "gildings": {}, "id": "exxbos", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 5, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/ttcafterloss/comments/exxbos/question/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1580685604, "score": 1, "selftext": "Has anyone had a stillborn at full term 37weeks+\nThan have another baby?

I really want to believe we would have had a less traumatic time with a different doctor, but maybe this is just the way things work. I figured I'd make this post because it gets it out of my head for a while.  \n\n\nMy husband and I got pregnant after almost two years of trying to conceive, but miscarried at about ten weeks, five days. First pregnancy, no experience with any of this (which they obviously knew).\n\nThe way the OB's office broke the news to us was gut wrenching. It's burned into my brain - the Doctor said he saw a heartbeat in the exam room. We laughed. We were excited. My husband asked them if he would be getting a picture to take home today (duh) and they laughed and laughed.\n\nThen the ultrasound tech said she would take us to \"another machine\" to get a better picture. There, (with a vaginal ultrasound) she measured and confirmed there was no heartbeat and that the fetus was about a week behind growth-wise. Basically, she told us she didn't see the heartbeat in the exam room, even though the doctor said he did.\n\nThe bigger problem was that between hearing that we had a heartbeat from the doctor and the clarifying ultrasound, we were sent to \"our\" nurse for \"OB intake\" to answer all of the questions they wanted to know about our birthing preferences, medical histories, etc. They gave us pamphlets and even a book on pregnancy, and we joked about stupid quirks of our medical history and worked through the questions... told her how relieved I was there was a heartbeat... before finding out that the doctor was wrong and there was no heartbeat.\n\nHanding back the pamphlets and book to the OB nurse. Ugh that was a seriously messed up moment of my life. \n\nIt was near closing time when they discovered the miscarriage and the doctor was rushing to leave, and he spent maybe five minutes with us. He told me I needed a D&amp;C. Told me his office would call the next day (but somehow forgot the office was closed every Friday and it would be a full weekend before I got scheduled, or asked any questions). No one explained anything to me, I learned it all from Google that weekend, which was way worse.\n\nI would love to hear good OB stories of supportive staff and doctors.

Holy moly am I feeling it). All my other testing (including my husbands carotyoing) came back normal so she is essentially convinced my hashimotos/hypo diagnosis (got the positive antibodies) likely caused my miscarriages. I feel a tremendous sense of relief now that I can put a name to it and treat it...  but now I also feel like I\u2019m stuck. I feel so terrible physically and she started me on the thyroid med this morning. She said that we should really wait until my thyroid is normalized, otherwise I could miscarry again. She mentioned that bc my levels bounced so much within the month, she wouldn\u2019t be surprised if I was in range this month or next \u2014-  but all this just means I need to do more waiting... again. So, does anyone have any advice? How long did it take your body to regulate? How long until you stopped feeling awful? Did you have a successful pregnancy after your thyroid was under control? I just feel like all of a sudden I went from being a healthy 32 year old last year to a person with a chronic medical condition who also lost two babies. I realize that is not a helpful way to think about myself and I\u2019ve probably had the condition for a long time, but it\u2019s definitely a shift in my identity. Blah.

I miscarried on New Years Day. I had ordered a onesie from Amazon with \"Baby \\[Last Name\\] July 2020\" printed on it. It arrived two days after we found out I was most likely miscarrying. When we had ordered it, the plan was to use it to announce the pregnancy to my step kids at Christmas. Well of course that didn't happen.\n\nNow I feel like I'm going through the healing process and for whatever reason, it's important for me to do something with that onesie. The day it arrived, I kinda tossed it on the bed to show my husband and he quietly put it in his nightstand drawer. I've looked at it just one or two times since then. It's pretty painful to look at and I don't think I'm at the point where I'm ready to do anything with it, even if it's just to put it away in a box somewhere. Right now it's just in the same drawer.\n\nWhat I really want to do is somehow...idk, use it to commemorate the child I never got to meet. And I don't know what exactly I have in mind. Just something private with my husband, a little ceremony of sorts. It's the only tangible thing I have from the pregnancy (I threw away the pregnancy tests, which I now regret). I never got ultrasound pictures or anything like that. I can't see myself burying it somewhere because we're military and likely to move often. I'm not sure that I want something as big/obvious as a shadow box. Burning it together with my husband seems like it might be the cathartic experience I'm looking for but I really don't want to burn it.\n\nAnyway, sorry for the rambling, I was just wondering if anyone has done anything like this as sort of a memorial or if anyone has any ideas. I did find a charm locket necklace on Amazon that I'm going to get. I was thinking that whatever I do decide to do with the onesie, I'll do it privately with my husband and then have him put the necklace on me.

Had a few elective losses (I know... I know... please don't judge me...) in my younger years. I don't really want to talk about those but I suppose it's part of my story. Got married in 2016 and took my copper IUD out 5/2018. Zillions of chemical pregnancies (was pregnant back to back to back) then my baby. I lost her in 5/2019 at 16 weeks due to subchorionic hematoma. Been trying to conceive ever since and again have conceived every single cycle only to lose them all between 4-8 weeks (pre-heartbeat). I get pregnant every single cycle. I just can't seem to keep them. I'm 31. Every single test has come back clear and nothing has been found to be \"wrong\". I went to a fertility clinic who is going to test the only things left to test- they are taking my and my partner's blood to test for a chromosomal issue, I'm getting my tubes checked (flushed), and an endometrial biopsy. My doctor put me on 200mg progesterone to use daily after ovulation and I tried that for the last two cycles and more chemical pregnancies still. A lot of doctors say I am lucky I get pregnant so easily. They say just to keep going and I will be fine. Easy to say, I guess. I don't know. Why do I lose ALL OF THEM? Do more pregnancies just = more losses? Is the live birth rate probably the same as a woman who conceives less easily in the end? \n\nRegardless, when my baby died at 16 weeks (it was even worse because she was a girl- all I've ever wanted), I felt like I died. I have not been the same at all since. I don't care about anything else. I don't want to do anything except keep getting pregnant and waiting for one of them to stick. I just don't care at all. I hate having to pretend to care about other things because I simply don't. I'm not happy and I don't enjoy anything at all. This is not a choice. I have slowly lost all of my family members over the years and have none. I love my husband but his family is all overseas and are not the supportive types either. He misses the \"old me\" but I wish he could just accept this one. I feel like I don't have a choice. I can't even force myself to try or care. I just don't. I can't fool myself. I got a puppy after all of the first chemicals (but before my baby) and she was only 4 weeks old and I fed her by bottle and it was amazing. My heart and myself felt full and alive. Of course, I still love her but she is grown now. I know I will be okay once I am somewhat far into another pregnancy. I'm not just saying that- it's sincere. But I don't know how to live in the meantime. I wish I could continue sulking and waiting in misery because that is what feels natural to me right now. What happened was devastating... why are we not allowed to sulk and mourn and grieve? I also have nothing in common with any of my friends anymore as none of them are actively TTC right now and I don't care about anything else. Plus, they don't understand how I feel and most are still single and dating. My mind is on baby ONLY. Is anyone else feeling the same? Do you allow yourself to sulk and be miserable or did you find a way to fake sanity for everyone else's sake? Because that's what I feel like I'd be doing. I cannot be open with anybody I know about this because to be honest they don't really understand nor care. I'm not mad at them I just don't feel like seeing them when my mind is preoccupied with this. HOW DO YOU COPE AND WHAT IS YOUR LIFE LIKE RIGHT NOW!? CAN'T WE JUST BE MISERABLE UNTIL WE ACHIEVE SUCCESSFUL PREGNANCIES!? WHY AREN'T WE ALLOWED!? ISN'T IT JUSTIFIED!? Please someone answer... I feel so alone and miserable. I wish my husband and I were both into the sulking but he's not I guess. He wants me to be \"happy\" (GOD I WANNA BASH HIM IN THE HEAD WHEN HE SAYS THAT!!!)

I connected with the Facebook page and everyone pushes to see one of two doctors. I made an appt for a phone consult with one of them. \n\nAfter that consult he told me he believes I have scarring and wanted to do the hysteroscopy surgery. I asked where the scarring was and if he could see it from the SIS images and apparently my clinic never sent them even though I specifically asked for that to be done. I\u2019m feeling very apprehensive about jumping to surgery based on a diagnosis with no imaging reviewed. \n\nMy husband wants to find a second opinion with a local RE to repeat the SIS to get better imaging. My gut feeling says the same thing. \n\nI\u2019m SO frustrated because I was hoping to get some clarity today and instead I feel like I\u2019m back to square one.

The letter from the hospital exactly one month after my D&amp;C surgery, we were stressed as to what it could be. It being something so mundane was actually a relief. \n\nSo being the good health conscious person I am, I phone, I book an appointment and I go and see the nurse.\n\nTake a take working from home. Get to the nurse at 2 this afternoon. Go in and she won\u2019t to the smear test because it\u2019s too soon after the miscarriage. It needs to be 12 weeks post surgery to make sure everything is back to normal. (Totally fair: I just wish anyone had told me that before being at the doctors surgery)\n\nShe then asks me if I\u2019m using contraception? Me: no. Asks me if I want contraception. I say no again, trying to be polite when I know I was being a little snippy. Her whole demeanour changes when it becomes extra clear it was a planned and wanted pregnancy. She Asks if I\u2019m getting any support post miscarriage because it\u2019s a very real, traumatic thing, not to be underplayed etc. I just cried. I\u2019m not a crier. Until this whole experience my husband had seen my cry maybe a total of four times in the almost 8 years we\u2019ve been together. Crying in front of people is just not enjoyable.\n\nAnd I have to go back again in 5 weeks to do it all again. \n\nTo top it all off I\u2019m meant to be going on a work night out tonight and one of the girls in my team is 6 weeks ahead of where I should be at this point and is now got quite the obvious bump. I\u2019m happy for her, I am. \n\nIt\u2019s just that this was going to be the night I announced (it\u2019s been a planned night out since November) and I would have been sixteen weeks and showing. \n\nToday is proving to be a harder day than anticipated and I just needed to vent.", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "ttcafterloss", "subreddit_id": "t5_34scd", "subreddit_subscribers": 6824, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Smear Test Drama", "total_awards_received": 0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/ttcafterloss/comments/f0c32v/smear_test_drama/"}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "tibbymoon", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_cjq8q", "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_premium": false, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1581091929, "domain": "i.redd.it", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/ttcafterloss/comments/f0clsr/good_to_know_fb_will_allow_you_to_hide_baby_ads/", "gildings": {}, "id": "f0clsr", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": true, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": false, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 1, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/ttcafterloss/comments/f0clsr/good_to_know_fb_will_allow_you_to_hide_baby_ads/", "pinned": false, "post_hint": "image", "preview": {"enabled": true, "images": [{"id": "Nn8ydbAH8SeRsPzHDQ3WQE5c966uaSquq2tG-CxlIUc", "resolutions": [{"height": 44, "url": "https://preview.redd.it/kqik5vgg0jf41.png?width=108&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=57c714e55a529fdfadf4a2b84436cd6ce2255b93", "width": 108}, {"height": 88, "url": "https://preview.redd.it/kqik5vgg0jf41.png?width=216&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=fe9dd5d63452ae2b25bd6590a9ff39dd3bd49381", "width": 216}, {"height": 131, "url": "https://preview.redd.it/kqik5vgg0jf41.png?width=320&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2e491bba40fe7cc9007c3ba31b5b3917e8116ed0", "width": 320}, {"height": 263, "url": "https://preview.redd.it/kqik5vgg0jf41.png?width=640&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a59e63b0b306c76818a227574e6524da36a03b72", "width": 640}, {"height": 395, "url": "https://preview.redd.it/kqik5vgg0jf41.png?width=960&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d1bcd0b02d743a1cb3911150a531292968f9eba5", "width": 960}, {"height": 444, "url": "https://preview.redd.it/kqik5vgg0jf41.png?width=1080&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6a9a867199e3c9e1c4eb21571b4274b19a6dad32", "width": 1080}], "source": {"height": 828, "url": "https://preview.redd.it/kqik5vgg0jf41.png?auto=webp&amp;s=582a4ca23bb22bae62d0a0a500bb02f8da91ac9f", "width": 2010}, "variants": {}}]}, "retrieved_on": 1581091932, "score": 1, "selftext": "", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "ttcafterloss", "subreddit_id": "t5_34scd", "subreddit_subscribers": 6824, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "image", "thumbnail_height": 57, "thumbnail_width": 140, "title": "Good to know: FB will allow you to hide baby ads, which I've been getting plenty of since my CP", "total_awards_received": 0, "url": "https://i.redd.it/kqik5vgg0jf41.png"}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "SweetDanyella", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_4ezi0ozk", "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_premium": false, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1581092384, "domain": "self.ttcafterloss", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/ttcafterloss/comments/f0cpna/anyone_try_soy_isoflavones_for_ovulation_help/", "gildings": {}, "id": "f0cpna", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 3, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/ttcafterloss/comments/f0cpna/anyone_try_soy_isoflavones_for_ovulation_help/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1581092385, "score": 1, "selftext": " I've done my research and its helped alot of women.
