Our doctor told us we must wait two cycles--the first will be in 4-6 weeks, and I'm like a Swiss clock so then another 4 weeks after that.

I lost a lot of myself, and disconnected from my lovely husband in many ways, too. Yet I really, really just want to get back on this train, even with all the heartache we've experienced. Our specific circumstances aren't indicative of any fertility problems, and the chances of having conjoined twins again are almost impossible.\n\nAside from grieving, which seems an unpredictable element, I don't see a reason to wait. Am I missing something? I'm not thrilled by the prospect of being super pregnant in summer, as I would be if we got lucky our first time trying again and things went better than they did this time, but aside from that I don't see an issue.\n\nThose who consciously decided to wait to try longer than the minimum advised by your doctors, what made you want to wait? Did anyone have a disconnect with your partner about when to try again, and if so, how did you resolve the disconnect?\n\nFor context, my husband and I have been married almost a year, known each other for two, and this was our first pregnancy.

I hope this is OK for this sub...\n\nA few weeks ago a few of you had suggested that I may benefit from therapy.  I agreed that it could be helpful.  I wasn't really sure what to look for in a therapist or what I'm hoping to get out from therapy, so I figured I'd just find some potential therapists while I figure out what I wanted.  Popped my location, insurance company, and some other preferences into some sort of therapist/psychologist database and got back a handful of names in my area.  I was feeling mostly OK at the time so I left it at that and put the therapist search on a back-burner.\n\nSince then a bunch of small things came up, and it triggered an avalanche of resentment, anger, hurt, and sadness that I've clearly been in denial about.  To keep it short, I'll put it in bullet points with things listed mostly in reverse chronological order.  I also apologize for how long, rambly, and ranty this all is :(...\n\n* A week ago SisterA sent me pictures of SisterB trying on bridesmaid dresses for SisterA's wedding in the early spring.  Mom and SisterB liked one of the dresses, I replied back that I agree that looked the best.\n* This prompted me to recall that a few weeks earlier while looking at wedding dresses with SisterA, she told me that she was thinking of having me handle seating instead of being a bridesmaids because I'm super organized and would be \"more useful behind the scenes.\"  She would instead ask a friend to be her second bridesmaid.  Her wedding, her call, so I said, \"OK no problem.\"\n* This subsequently reminded me that a few weeks further back while I was 6 weeks pregnant, I found out that she was considering a date within 2 days of my EDD for her wedding.  After some consideration, I decided to go ahead and give SisterA a head's up.  During this conversation she mentioned she was going to ask me to be a bridesmaid but given the timing, it probably would be difficult for me.  I agreed with her assessment.  A week later I found out I was going to lose the pregnancy.  Since timing was no longer a problem, we had several conversations indicating that I would be a bridesmaid as planned.\n* I remembered that SisterA had previously insinuated that she and her husband-to-be planned to start trying for kids ASAP, and it got me thinking that she'll probably beat me to kids, *even though I know it is NOT a competition*.\n* Mom was with us while looking at wedding dresses for SisterA, she had made some really rude comments about SisterA's weight and short stature, comparing her to the tall slender woman next to us who was also trying on dresses and looked amazing in everything.  This reminded me of all the shitty things my parents said to me over the course of 3 years when I was dating, engaged, and planning a wedding.  How they tried to convince me to break up with my husband because of his race and lack of religious beliefs (I'm atheist, too), then called me a slut because I had gone on a trip with him after we were engaged.  My sisters jumped on the slut-shaming bandwagon, too.  Shockingly(/s), I only minimally involved my family in my wedding--they were really more like guests who happened to be family of the bride--and dad told SisterA how unhappy he was that I didn't have him give me away, or include a father-daughter dance.\n* I was already feeling kinda down with SisterA sending me pics of SisterB in bridesmaid dresses, but what really sent me over the edge was yesterday when my childhood best friend posted an album with family photos of her parents, brother, husband, and MIL with their two kids, celebrating her youngest's first month.\n\nI'm sure her family has had disagreements and fights too, and I'm fully aware that FB walls are typically curated to present the best moments... but damn did that album make me feel like utter shit.\n\nTo be clear: I am truly happy for my friend, and for all I know she could have had her own struggles with infertility and simply never advertised it.  But her FB wall is filled with photos of all her kids' milestones, personalized hashtags for each of them, and lots of candid photos of them doing cute, silly kid things.  I'm considering whether to simply stop following her (while still being friends), but other friends' posts of their kids don't bother me.\n\nAnyway, I thought I was being pretty good about hiding my feelings while I processed them, but my husband knew something was up and asked me about it.  I had planned to talk to him once I figured out what I wanted to say, but since he asked I gave him a brief overview of what's been bothering me, he gave me hugs and kisses, and I've come to the realization that I really need to talk to a professional about all these issues.  But now, I'm not even sure what sort of specialties I should be looking for since it seems like I could fall into a lot of categories ranging from miscarriage/infertility to feelings of inadequacy to ... I don't know, maybe general depression??  I've also been drinking a lot more recently, and it takes a bit of a conscious reminder to myself to NOT pour myself a drink every night, so I suppose you can add at-risk-alcoholic to that list.  Should I find one therapist with experience in all these areas, or see more than one simultaneously (which seems overkill to me)?\n\nI know I would like to avoid taking any sort of medication, and I also know I don't want to really address any of these issues with my parents because it is simply not going to go anywhere.  Their words and actions are very Asian Parent Style Tough Love.  As an example, when SisterA rolled her eyes at mom's comment about her begin fat, mom said, \"You just don't like hearing that because you know I'm speaking the truth.  I'm telling you the truth for your own good.\"  Also, since getting married they've mellowed out and our relationship is much better... though I think it's mostly because they now consider me my husband's responsibility and I because see them only once a month despite living in the same city.  The only reason I'd confront them is to draw hard boundaries on how they treat my kids, but the score thus far is 5/5 dead babies so it feels presumptuous to even bring up right now.", "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "ttcafterloss", "subreddit_id": "t5_34scd", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "It's probably time for me to see a therapist to deal with my anger", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/ttcafterloss/comments/77f98i/its_probably_time_for_me_to_see_a_therapist_to/"}, {"author": "AutoModerator", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_text": null, "brand_safe": false, "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1508483351, "distinguished": "moderator", "domain": "self.ttcafterloss", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/ttcafterloss/comments/77kj5j/ttcafterloss_ttc_daily_discussion_thread_october/", "id": "77kj5j", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_css_class": "ttc", "link_flair_text": "TTC Thread", "locked": false, "num_comments": 24, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/ttcafterloss/comments/77kj5j/ttcafterloss_ttc_daily_discussion_thread_october/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1508570008, "score": 2, "selftext": "**This thread is for members who are TTC or waiting to try.

I didn't think there was any research to back it up. But I found a 2016 study yesterday that showed that women had about a 40% less chance of conception if they were exposed to high levels of stress. They also found that even if an egg is fertilized it might not implant due to stress hormones.\n\nSo, I'm aware that this is only one study and that studies can contradict one another. But now I'm wondering how the hell I'm ever going to conceive again. I mean, it's not like we have stress from our jobs. My high levels of stress are caused by losing my son and needing to go through pregnancy to have another living child and being petrified that something will go wrong at any point along the way. So how the hell am I supposed to destress?\n\nHave any of you found things that help you to deal with your anxiety while TTC?

They had been dating, broke up, found out she was pregnant after they broke up, tried to make it work for the baby, split up after the loss. \nI don't want to ask inappropriate questions because I don't feel it's my place to prod into such a bad time in his life, especially since I know therapy worked wonders for him. \nHas anyone here experienced loss with a different partner than you're currently with?

I'm sad to have to be here but also glad I don't have to suffer in silence. \n\nBack in 2009 I was 19 and had a surprise pregnancy. This pregnancy turned out to be a blighted ovum. I had a D&amp;C and was heartbroken. My boyfriend and I at the time decided to actually try and got pregnant again right away the next cycle. That pregnancy seemed absolutely normal until my gender scan at 19 weeks. It was to be the happiest day and made an ugly turn for the worst. The ultrasound tech wasn't saying anything and had to get up to go get the doctor. They explained that the baby was measuring only 16 weeks and seemed to have quite a few abnormalities. I was sent to a women's hospital for an amniocentesis which confirmed that my baby girl had Triploidy. A rare, random chromosomal defect which is incompatible with life. I had to make the decision to carry on and wait for my baby to die and deliver her, risking health complications for myself or to be induced and deliver her. I made the difficult decision to deliver her then. \n\nMy doctor and the specialists assured me that the blighted ovum and baby with triploidy were not related at all. They assured me these are completely random and unavoidable. They are not signs of a chromosomal or genetic defect in myself and there is no reason I could not go on to have a healthy baby. I simply was having bad luck. I was young and with the stress of losing our baby, my boyfriend and I at the time split not long after her death. \n\nFast forward 8 years later and here I am again. I'm now 26 and in a very loving relationship with a great man. We decided I would go off birth control in September. I again got pregnant right away. I had 8 positive pregnancy tests between last Monday-Wednesday. We were both ecstatic and I was so sure of this pregnancy. \n\nFriday evening I started to have some cramping and light spotting. By the time I woke up on Saturday I was full on bleeding. I called my OB on call staff and they told me to go to the ER. I was evaluated, had blood work and an ultrasound. My hcg was only 16 and there was nothing to be found in my uterus. The ER doctor said he couldn't even tell me if I was pregnant for sure or not and blamed faulty, too-sensitive pregnancy tests for giving me false positives. I know he was just trying to make me feel better, but I know how unlikely that is. 8 false positive tests with varying brands of tests with my period over a week late? Not likely. I knew from doing research I was having a chemical pregnancy. I'm supposed to follow up today with more blood work to rule out an ectopic pregnancy. \n\nSo, here I am. Young and healthy with 3 losses under my belt. I'm frustrated because I keep hearing it's just \"bad luck\". That there's no reason I can't go on to have a healthy baby and pregnancy. All 3 of my losses can possibly be from chromosomal abnormalities. I'm starting to think I have poor quality eggs..\n\nThank you for reading this if you did.

I left this subreddit in May when DH deployed because I was expecting to be out for the rest of the year. However, due to a major death in the family, he\u2019s home and I\u2019m back in the game. I\u2019m not sure if anyone here remembers me but here is some BG info-\n\nBeen TTC since May 2016. Came off the pill in that same month. Got pregnant in January of this year but MC\u2019d around Valentine\u2019s Day @6wks. I started tracking at that time but did not get pregnant again before DH left. \n\nI\u2019m coming to an end of a cycle and I wanted to ask you ladies a question. I\u2019m starting to suspect I have low progesterone levels due to the following: trouble conceiving, staying pregnant, spotting during my LP, short LP (12 Days give or take) among other random symptoms I\u2019ve seen with it. \n\nHere\u2019s the Q- could low progesterone affect my pre-pregnancy HCG level and how fast it rises if I conceive? \n\nI\u2019m asking this because in January I took an FRER and got a BFN a day before I expected AF to come. I wasn\u2019t tracking so I could have been off but there was a window of time we were BDing and a long gap where we didn\u2019t so I had to have O\u2019d sometime around that BD period. I didn\u2019t get my BFP until the day after I expected AF (expected was CD27, BFP was CD28). It was super faint. I almost didn\u2019t call it a BFP. \n\nSo now I\u2019m at the end of my cycle. I read LP shouldn\u2019t change much. Mine from my tracked cycles is 11-12 days. I\u2019m on 13/14. No BFP. That\u2019s why I\u2019m asking about the progesterone effect on HCG. It is possible I O\u2019d later since I was really sick during my fertile window but there\u2019s no way I could have gotten accurate temps (if I had been temping) at the time to confirm if O happened and I wasn\u2019t going to continue to pee on OPKs. \n\nThanks for any info you ladies may have!

Got pregnant first month trying after that, but miscarried at 8 weeks in April. I decided to take a break for a while because I was heartbroken and didn\u2019t think I could handle it if the worst happened again.  I did the testing my OB recommended, which all came back normal. I also wanted to make sure my husband was taking supplements, etc. before starting again.\n\nAnyway, here we are. I think I ovulated a couple days ago, but the OPKs were unclear so I can\u2019t be sure. We tried to follow the sperm meets egg plan, but with illness and an unclear ovulation date it didn\u2019t go quite according to plan. We did ok, but Im a little disappointed we didn\u2019t do everything we could. Maybe it\u2019s for the best... I tend to get a little obsessive (more than a little), but if I don\u2019t know the exact ov date it might force me to embrace the unknown a little more.\n\nWhile we were waiting to try, I was really focused on healing and got to a much better place. I told myself I would keep up my hobbies and stay busy to avoid obsessing about TTC. About a week before we started I was beating myself up a little for not having done enough (we never saw a fertility specialist - only our OB), but felt pretty good and relaxed about everything overall. Then after we started trying, one of my closest friends announced she was pregnant. I am very happy for her and she\u2019s coming off a miscarriage of her own, so she gets it, but I feel like it\u2019s put some additional pressure on me to get pregnant soon. The longer I go without getting pregnant, the harder it will be to see her growing belly. I don\u2019t want to have to put space between us. Hearing her news took some wind out of my sails that\u2019s been hard to get back.\n\nMost of the time I\u2019m either sad, angry, or worried. And the worst part is I know that getting pregnant is only step one of the long battle ahead. I think that\u2019s where a lot of my anger and frustration comes from.. that I know there are no guarantees and any happiness is tainted by the fact that it can be ripped from me in an instant.\n\nThanks to anyone who read this far in my long, rambling post.

She had a rare disease and doctors didn't expect her to survive past the age of 3. Everyone keeps talking too much, telling her that \"she's in heaven now\" and all the other amazing platitudes that I'm sure we all love. My aunt is very religious, but it doesn't help when everyone seems to be trying to *convince* her of something she already knows.\n\nI was really hoping you guys might be able to share any articles with me that I could pass along to the family. Because she's immediately related to these people, I'm afraid she'll get it worse than I did, and I would like to attempt to help that not happen as much as possible. I read a great one here geared specifically toward family and friends who wanted to help or better understand, and I would love to be able to pass that on.

Throughout the flight I'd clench my stomach in pain every few minutes. I shifted in my seat and felt a gush. I quickly got up and walked to the bathroom feeling it running down my leg wishing it was pee. It wasn't. The stewardess got my husband for me as I panicked on the toilet. One of the stewardesses came into the bathroom and comforted me, she had a miscarriage once on a plane also at 11 weeks. \n\nThey call the paramedics for when we land and I took the ambulance to the hospital. After an ultrasound and unstoppable bleeding it was confirmed. The ER doctor suspected the baby had stopped growing a few weeks earlier and my HCG levels had finally dropped low enough to miscarry at terrible timing. Constant labour pains in my uterus and back. They monitored me for 6 hours and did a physical exam to get rid of a lot of the clots and then I was released told I would bleed for up to 3 weeks and could try again after my next cycle. \n\nThe airline was amazing and got us a hotel room and changed our flights to the next day, \n\nDay 2 we told our families. I was feeling okay throughout the day physically maybe every 10 minutes would cramp a little. We get home around 5pm my sister brings us supper and as the night goes on the pain becomes excruciating. First it was every 5 minutes then it was every minute knives digging into my uterus and twisting and more blood clots. My sister gave me some stronger pain meds she had and it didn't do much but finally after 3 hours of pain it started to come less frequently until I could finally sleep. \n\nAnd now it's day 3 and I'm so sad and it still hurts. \n\nDay 4 tomorrow is another ultrasound and a doctors appointment. \n\nI'm still here.

The tears turned on and off at the blink of an eye during the 20-minute ride home at 2 a.m. I couldn't help but think of the last nighttime drive we made to the hospital. My water had broken and we were on our way to have our baby girl. So full of anticipation and excitement, with no clue about how significantly our lives were about to change. Just three years ago, we walked into the hospital with a broken amniotic sac; this time, we left the hospital with broken hearts. \n\nThe coming weeks brought a few answers. The \"products of conception\" (ugh) were tested and revealed no genetic abnormalities. That knowledge brought fresh tears. My perfect little baby. My son. There was no reason that we knew of for him to die. I inadvertently learned the gender while reading the lab results from the tissue analysis. Part of me knew that information could be in there, but I kept reading with a morbid curiosity. Do I wish I hadn't read it? No. The knowledge that we lost a son is significant. I could picture our life with him in it, but the same moment that that dream entered my mind, it was shattered. It was one of those moments where you birth a dream and have it die at the exact same time.

Saw an RE in Feb to start infertility diagnosis who found a huge fibroid at the top of my uterus. Was it causing my IF? No way to know but would not treat me further unless I had them out. So, surgery in March 2017 (10K out of pocket + RE costs, I live in the southern US where IF coverage generally sucks). Recovery took 3 mos. Start trying again in June 2016. Back to RE. Surgery got rid of the fibroids but scarring resulted in one tube being closed off. AMH found to be low, suggesting DOR. So maybe my sucky eggs were the problem. RE recommended IVF with genetic testing as the only viable option. We do not want to pay 30K out of pocket for one shot (this would be a single cycle) at a kid. Started seeing an acupuncturist instead who is wonderful, suggested eating more eggs, taking Omega 3-6-9, vit D, and CoQ10. Did that, got pregnant again in August 2017. Two weeks ago at my 8 week scan, no heartbeat, 2nd MC. D&amp;C last Weds. So now I'm back at the surgeon's, just paid $200 for what I imagine will be a handshake.

Multiple rounds of misoprostol and miscarried with lots of bleeding Saturday, Oct 14. Things seemed to progress normally so I waited until Monday morning to call Drs office. They said everything sounded fine but they would check with Dr. to see if I needed to come in. Had me come in for US to see if I passed everything (48 hrs after MC). US tech showed results to Dr while I waited (still some thick lining, potential tissue remaining) and then sent me home with birth control and instructions to come back in two weeks for an hcg beta to see if my levels where back to 0.\n\nThey were told that I am A- and that the father is O+ and confirmed this before my MC. This was my first pregnancy and I trusted them to take proper precautions. A couple days ago, I realized that they did not give me Rhogam within 72 hours of my MC and called the office. The front desk woman did not sound like she even understood what I was talking about and at first told me I was 'just A', not A-. Then the nurse called me back and told me that they only give it to pregnant women and there is no risk of sensitization from MC, which I know is not true. \n\nI called my Drs cell directly yesterday and she said that I should have gone to the hospital after my MC (which they never told me to do) and they would have given me the shot there but I can get it on Monday. I expressed concern that we are not even close to the required 72 hr window and asked for a sensitization test and she said that she was told it was a 32 day window and they wouldn't give me a test until months after my Rhogam shot on Monday.\n\nI am so angry and frustrated. Everything I read from trusted sources indicates that the '32 day window' is not a thing and that I can't change it if I am sensitized now. If I am, then my future pregnancies will be high-risk because of an entirely preventable immune response if they had given me Rhogam when they saw me for the US. I don't believe that the office, nurse, or doctor know what they are talking about at this point. If I get the shot on Monday (which is likely to do nothing this long after potential exposure), then I won't be able to get an accurate sensitization test before we planned on started ttc again. \n\nSorry for the extended explanation! Any thoughts on whether or not I should get the shot on Monday? Should I refuse and get the sensitization test elsewhere?

Jan 2017 I found out I was pregnant after having sex once around ovulation. Miscarried late Jan/early Feb at 7w4d. Took a few months off to heal emotionally. Started trying again in July and got instantly pregnant again. No fetal pole/heartbeat at 8 weeks. No fetal pole/heartbeat again at 9 weeks. No fetal pole/heartbeat yet again at 11 weeks so Dr finally called it and gave me Misoprostol to get things going. Took those on Sept 22 and miscarried basically everything within 4-5 hours. Last week I had laparoscopic surgery to remove the very large cyst on my left ovary that had been caught on my first ultrasound back in Jan. Unfortunately, I ended up losing that ovary and my left tube. That brings us to now.\n\nAt my 11 week ultrasound to triple confirm that I did not have a viable pregnancy, I asked my OB about fertility testing because I am quite honestly a fucking mess after 2 miscarriages, that I can't stand the thought of doing this a third time. I'm desperate for answers as to why this has happened to me twice now. My OB's nurse just called me a bit ago to give me 2 fertility clinics to look into, so I can discuss the next steps at my post-op follow up next week. As we were talking, my first post-miscarriage period showed up.\n\nI'm stuck. Do we start trying since it's CD1 for me and I'll be cleared for sex right in time for my potential fertile window? Or do we wait and go the fertility clinic route?\n\nI told my husband that I want to discuss this and that I want honest feedback and opinions from him, but I already know he will tell me that he wants to do whatever I want to do. He's supportive almost to a fault sometimes because he just wants me to be happy and to do whatever I am comfortable with. Basically, he is zero help.\n\nMy real questions to all of you out there: if you have a history of recurrent miscarriages, did you go to a fertility clinic? What was the process like for you? What made you decide to go to a fertility clinic? Did it help diagnose what was causing the miscarriages? Were you able to go on to have a successful pregnancy?

We were terrified and excited all at once. I went from having panic attacks at lunch to looking at nursery ideas that night.\n\nAt 7 weeks to the day, right at the end of the month, I lost the pregnancy. I don't have a lot of details on what happened that time, by the time we got the ultrasound at the ER whatever had been was gone and all we were left with was a bill bigger than my deductible and for me to have a bunch of nurses tell me they were sorry and offer me Tylenol. I took the next day off to cry and got pretty plastered over the weekend at a lake house. My HcG was back to 0 by the end of the week. I lurked here a bit that first week, but I was optimistic enough that I didn't lurk beyond that.\n\nIn the follow-up to my first loss my OB said to wait until I got my period before trying again, but things did not go to plan. We oopsed our way into pregnancy 2 before my period could return which got me an almost immediate ultrasound. I was so shocked and terrified that the nurse assumed that I didn't want the baby. (She was very wrong.) \n\nBy my best guess, I should have been 6w4d but development showed an empty sac, so I was no more than the end of week 5. The doctor scheduled me for follow-up the next week, assuming the dates were off, I tried to stay optimistic- said more than a few positive affirmations to my reproductive organs- but knew something wasn't right. The next appointment showed no changes. I was measuring exactly the same. I gave it a week to see if things would happen naturally but my uterus refused to believe what was happening and so I ended up opting for a D&amp;C. I surprised the nurses by cracking jokes as I came off anesthesia, because nothing masks the pain so well as self depreciating humor.\n\nAgain I was told to wait till my period came back, which - spoilers - we managed to do, but it was a long wait. I was still showing positive on home tests two weeks after the procedure. I told my doctor that I knew it was going to take a while at my two week follow-up which a) he didn't believe (even when I pointed out I have a 35 day cycle normally and the last loss pushed things back already)  and b) caused him to suggest I take progesterone, which I declined because I forgot it can be used to encourage a period. \n\nI did, however, take him up on a recommendation for a preconception visit with a MFM... which he only did after I mentioned some of my mother's pregnancy horror stories and he remembered that my blood pressure has been nearly \"send her to the ER\" levels every visit. Making that appointment was it's own soap opera as the nurse didn't realize I had miscarried and I gross cried in the reception area after she asked me my due date twice despite having the referral with my diagnosis in hand.\n\nThat brings us to now:\nMy period finally came back, my regular doctor reluctantly put me on BP meds, and according to my tracker my fertile window is just about here. My appointment with the MFM Dr. is next week and hopefully we will get some actual answers because I am sick of people telling me this was just bad luck and I'm sick of people telling me I will \"for sure\" have a baby.\n\nThank you all for being a supportive community, having lurked here every day since mid-September I appreciate the care you all take for each situation , and if anyone has ever been to a pre-conception consult with an MFM Dr. I'd appreciate any idea of what I'm getting into.", "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "ttcafterloss", "subreddit_id": "t5_34scd", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Intro - 2017 and 2 for 2 on Miscarriages", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/ttcafterloss/comments/79xvbo/intro_2017_and_2_for_2_on_miscarriages/"}, {"author": "EmmaFurburger", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_text": null, "brand_safe": false, "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1509507780, "domain": "self.ttcafterloss", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/ttcafterloss/comments/7a16vy/well_im_back/", "id": "7a16vy", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "locked": false, "num_comments": 32, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/ttcafterloss/comments/7a16vy/well_im_back/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1509590481, "score": 9, "selftext": "Today would be 6 weeks.

My husband's karyotype testing and sperm analysis are completely normal. I have two genetic mutations, PAI 4G/4G and ACE Insertion/Deletion mutation. Simplified by my doctor, the PAI mutation means that I don't break down clots well enough and the ACE I/D mutation means that I make too many clots in the first place. He did say that there wasn't a lot of consensus whether the PAI 4G/4G mutation caused repeat pregnancy loss, but he is very convinced/confident that the two mutations together are causing my issues.\n\nOkay, so what do we do about it? Well he said we have two options. First, the \"Do Nothing\" option, is we try to get pregnant again naturally and then go on baby aspirin and lovenox upon getting a positive HPT. The second option is we do IVF. He says the pros to do IVF is that we can genetically test the embryo before implantation, so we know right away there won't be any genetic issues and we can start the blood thinners 7 days prior to implantation. According to him, the \"Do nothing\" option means we are just playing catch up because we wouldn't start blood thinners until after implantation had already occurred. He also said that with three miscarriages, the likelihood of having another miscarriage on a subsequent pregnancy is in the ball park of 60-70%. IDK where he got those numbers from, but in this book I've read, \"Miscarriage: What Every Woman Needs to Know,\" it says the risk of a subsequent miscarriage after three is approximately 43%. Now this book was published in 1997, so it is probably outdated, but I don't think the risk has gone up that much since that time. Right?\n\nIDK I feel frustrated because I feel like he is trying to push us into IVF with fear tactics. Even calling the first option the \"Do Nothing\" option bothered me because we aren't doing nothing, we are coming up with a treatment plan that includes baby aspirin and lovenox. I have nothing against IVF and it is an option we definitely might chose, but it is very expensive! I have infertility coverage, which I am very grateful for because I know a lot of women don't, but it is still expensive even with the coverage. \n\nSo I am leaning more towards trying again naturally, but maybe take the baby aspirin for my entire cycle and then start the lovenox with a positive HPT. I think my husband is a little more conservative and wants to go to the IVF because he thinks that will guarantee a health baby, since we would know there wouldn't be genetic issues. I had to tell him that nothing guarantees we get to take home a healthy baby.\n\nSooo what do you guys think? I know ultimately it is up to my husband and I, but we're a little up in the air right now. For anyone on IVF and who is willing to share: Did you pay per cycle/round of IVF or were you able to get multiple rounds of IVF for a payment? How was your experience with it? Is the egg retrieval painful?\n\nThanks!\n\n", "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "ttcafterloss", "subreddit_id": "t5_34scd", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "RE visit and IVF decision", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/ttcafterloss/comments/7a5aa6/re_visit_and_ivf_decision/"}, {"author": "moarwineprs", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_text": "35 | TTC #1 since Jan 2017, 5 CP/MCs; benched until mid-Nov 2017", "brand_safe": false, "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1509563149, "domain": "self.ttcafterloss", "edited": 1509564810, "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/ttcafterloss/comments/7a5s3j/chromosome_analysis_and_carrier_screening_came/", "id": "7a5s3j", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "locked": false, "num_comments": 3, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/ttcafterloss/comments/7a5s3j/chromosome_analysis_and_carrier_screening_came/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1509645504, "score": 2, "selftext": "About a month ago husband and I went ahead with getting tests done for chromosome analysis and carrier screening.  We were supposed to have a follow-up appointment with the geneticists tomorrow, but one of them called me up this afternoon to discuss the results and ask if we'd still like to come in tomorrow.  Turns out our chromosomes are all normal (great!), I'm not a carrier for any of the 250+ things they tests, and my husband is a carrier for just one.  While there is still a chance we could both be carriers for something that they did *not* test, based on these results it's unlikely to be a genetic reason we can't conceive and carry a child to term.  Given that our results are normal, the geneticists didn't think there is a need for us to go the appointment tomorrow as there aren't any other logical recommendations they can offer to us, though it would absolutely be OK for us to still go anyway if we have additional questions.  We'll get a copy of the results via mail.\n\nI'm glad that things are normal, even though it leaves us still uncertain as to what could be wrong.  I'm thinking it might just boil down to either eggs of poor quality, a hormonal problem, or just plain bad luck.  I suppose it's possible that it could be a clotting disorder as MTHFR was NOT tested (I had asked about it already), but that would be something I'd talk about to my OB during the follow-up appointment in December, or to the RE he refers me to.\n\nHusband and I are both looking to each other to decide whether to go, and neither of us have any questions that come to mind.  I told the geneticists that we'll talk about it tonight and I'll either call her office tomorrow to cancel, or we'll show up.  Obviously the benefit of not going is we'll save on the $25 copay per person, especially since we've already learned everything they had to say over the phone.
