What day is it?) as the girl who had a MC while being the MoH in a wedding on the other side of the country at the same time my dad had a critical heart attack/cardiac arrest. \n\nThank you all so much for your comments and messages; I was totally lost yesterday when I finally made it out of Philly and my SO left me at the airport to go to my parents. \n\nI thought Saturday\u2019s massive blood hemorrhaging was \u2018it\u2019 passing - it wasn\u2019t. I was fine-ish yesterday, but I got woken up at 5am with severe cramping that progressed over the next hour to excruciating back and uterus pain. I woke my mom up, and we immediately went to the ER, where I ended up all day. It turns out nothing actually came out over the weekend, and I was in full-on labor - that \u2018cramping\u2019 was actually contractions. I honestly have never been in that much agony... it just got worse and worse, where the in between was as bad as the initial contractions were, and the actual contractions were unbearable. \n\nAfter hours of this (and morphine/other drugs doing nothing), I finally got to see the oncall OB (and not the pregnant PA - that was hard), and she got me in for an immediate D&amp;C. Apparently my cervix wasn\u2019t even open yet, and it was going to take at least 24hrs for anything to start to pass.\n\nOver the course of it all, I almost passed out twice. The ultrasound also showed the baby measuring 8+1, which was exactly what it did the day I last had an ultrasound and saw the heartbeat, which is just devastating. My bicornuate uterus also appears to be a septate one, but the divider isn\u2019t huge, and the baby was implanted below it, so it\u2019s unlikely that was the cause.\n\nI am drained, but now have no pain. I\u2019m really glad my mom was there, but it was so hard being in labor and being like \u2018this was supposed to happen in six months with a baby\u2019. My dad is doing great and got moved out of ICU, and my brother was able to handle being with him all day while I stole my mom away. The nurses in the ER were amazed at his progress; he coded four times when they brought him in, and no one thought he\u2019d make it. I\u2019m going to try to stay here for a few more days and then finally fly home and hopefully resume some normalcy. I still wish I knew ahead of time what to expect with this; I didn\u2019t realize labor was part of the deal, and today was awful.\n\nBecause I should probably actually introduce myself (outside of this) - this was #1. I\u2019m 30, SO is 41 and has an 11yr old daughter from a previous marriage. We live in rural north east CA, outside of the huge lake up there. I was off BC for a year and took Clomid to ovulate (thank you, PCOS and endometriosis). Outside of all that, I work remotely as a software developer, have an older beagle, (used to) run long distance/trails, ski a lot (perks of mountain life), golf in the summers, and read and write probably too much. \n\nHugs to y\u2019all, I am so sorry we\u2019re all in this. If it\u2019s some consolation - nearly every doc/nurse/OB I talked to today either had or had a partner who had a MC.

It took me about a year for my husband and I to conceive her, as I learned that my ovulation is very sketchy. During my TTC journey the first time around, I had a few 65+ day cycles.\n\nWe started TTC for baby #2 in April and ended up getting pregnant on my second cycle in May. I was tracking ovulation for both cycles and ovulated around CD30 both times. That pregnancy ended with a miscarriage around 8 weeks. \n\nThe miscarriage itself was pretty mild, little to no cramps and moderate bleeding. It really just felt like a heavy period. I did not need any medical intervention in the way of medication or a D&amp;C/D&amp;E. My OBGYN tracked my HCG down to 0 (it took 3 1/2 weeks). \n\nThe dilemma:\n\nWhen I was given my results for my last HCG test over the phone, they told me that they recommend waiting one cycle before TTC again. When I asked for a reason why, they kind of stumbled over their words and said it was really just for dating purposes. I have read a lot of conflicting information about waiting 1-3 cycles for various reasons (some include how one miscarried... natural vs. D&amp;C/D&amp;E). \n\nAfter my HCG returned to 0, I started tracking ovulation using OPKs again. My reasoning was that it would really give me peace of mind knowing IF I am ovulating and when. If I wasn't tracking, I know I would be a wreck. I am now on CD34 and have gotten a clearly positive OPK 2 days in a row. My husband and I discussed waiting one cycle vs TTC right away and have been wavering back and forth. \n\nThat being said, the one time we didn't use protection was the night before my first positive OPK. I feel like I'm doing something wrong...\n\nSince my cycles are on average 45+ days long, I have a hard time knowing that every time I don't conceive, I have to wait for so long before even thinking about trying again. I hope this doesn't come across as whiny or insensitive, I just need a place to put down what I am feeling and going through. \n\nDoes anyone out there have a similar experience that they'd be willing to share?

We have a 27 month old boy - when I was pregnant with him I had no issues or complications. We got pregnant in March of 2017 which ended in a miscarriage - for this pregnancy my HCG never went above 280 and I had no pregnancy symptoms so we kinda saw it coming. We got pregnant again in September 2017 but found that it was a pregnancy of the unknown location and we ended up getting a shot of methotrexate. Again, no real pregnancy symptoms and my HCG was only at about 5000 in week 7.  With these two losses I was still breastfeeding and I think might have been the reason for losses. I got pregnant again June 2018 and this time around had really bad symptoms and was getting blood draws from the day I got a positive test. Everything looked great so far! We even saw a heartbeat when we went in to an emergency appt because of some mild spotting and cramping. Last friday was my checkup and we found out that the week prior the baby had stopped developing. We were give the options of wait for me to miscarry, a D&amp;C, or taking a pill at home. I took the pill and it was okay. I feel heartbroken but I think there might have been something wrong with the fetus this time. I don't think there is anything wrong with me. \n\nI don't know exactly what I am looking for. Is there anyone who has had these many losses? I go in for my follow up next week and the doctor will ask if I want to take a thyroid test or an autoimmune blood clotting disease test. If I opt for these, it will delay trying to get pregnant by a few months. I don't think I want to take the tests. I really believe that we just had a sting of bad luck this time around. If you made it this far, then thanks for letting me vent and listening. Any advice is more than welcome :).

The first was difficult because we had seen the heartbeat at 8 weeks and at the 12 week follow up ultrasound we found no heartbeat. We had told lots of people, a mistake I won\u2019t repeat. It was difficult and two cycles later my wife is pregnant again. \n\nSo, we have known for a few weeks we are pregnant and my wife\u2019s cycle is 42 days so we thought we were pretty far along. She had some brown spotting but no cramps and no red so fine we think it\u2019s implantation although it would be really late. Called the doc who scheduled an intravaginal ultrasound which showed a gestational sac at 5 weeks and 3 days ( we thought we were closer to 7 weeks). The doc doesn\u2019t do initial blood tests of hormones which I think is weird but anyway we got a baseline that day and another a couple days ago and it isn\u2019t \u201cquite progressing as it should\u201d which I assume means it hasn\u2019t doubled. Tomorrow we have another ultrasound which I think will confirm another miscarriage because my wife has no symptoms of pregnancy and in general does not feel pregnant. I\u2019ve been on the verge of panic attacks since we got pregnant and today is no different. I\u2019ve researched everything to death and can convince myself both ways but my heart tells me tomorrow will be a bad day. I want to support my wife anyway that I can because I know she hurts and has been hurting since our first miscarriage but I feel so helpless. \n\nAll that being said aside from sadness I feel a jealousy and disgust for other parents. I am jealous of the people who can get pregnant and never have any issues and have healthy happy children and I am disgust by people who mistreat the amazing gift they are given. It so hard for me because I feel like we are trying so hard and other people who have children could possible mistreat them or neglect them. Every form of media reminds me every day that we are on the verge of yet another miscarriage. \n\nI feel guilty for these feelings as well because it isn\u2019t their fault. I know I won\u2019t sleep tonight thinking about tomorrow but I need to because even more work starts tomorrow. The world keeps turning and we will keep trying. We discussed how many miscarriages we would go through and decided after 3 we will get testing done and then possibly 6 to call it quits. \n\nThanks for reading... this forum provides a catharsis for me. I hope all of your journeys have success stories.

This is going to be a little lengthy.\n\nWe were TTC for 2 years when we conceived our son (1 year ago today). We were diagnosed with \"unexplained\" infertility. All tests normal for both of us. We ended up conceiving with the help of Femara and Follistim. I found out on my Husband's birthday and told in a super corny way (gave him a card \"from\" our baby and the pregnancy tests I took). Pregnancy was great; no problems other than marginal previa that cleared up around 20 weeks. Our son was VERY active and spent a lot of time with his feet in my ribs. I had an NST on 5/1; one days before my due date, and everything was great. I was super uncomfortable, so OB agreed to schedule an induction for the 5/8 which would put me at 40+6. \n\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n\nOn Friday 5/4 my water broke around 11:30 PM so we headed to the hospital. When we got there and they were hooking me up to monitors the nurse was having a hard time finding heartbeat, but I was staying positive because sometimes he would move and it would take a second to find him. They decided to bring in an ultrasound to see where he was. The nurse did a quick scan and said it was just for positioning and she was going to have the Dr. come in. I knew right then that something was wrong. When the doctor came in and started scanning she was very quiet for what seemed like several minutes so I asked (yelled) if something was wrong a couple times. That was when she said that he didn't have a heartbeat. I could see it on the screen; I could see his heart just not beating. In that moment I thought I was going to die and I thought I was having a nightmare all at the same time. \nThey game me an epidural pretty quickly and I labored for about 12 hours before our son was delivered. \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n\nDelivery itself was pretty easy except for the fact that I was delivering my dead son. \nCole Robert was born at 11:51 on 5/5, weighed 6lbs 6oz, and was 20 in long. He was absolutely perfect. He had a full head of beautiful black hair and long skinny fingers and toes. We asked the nurse to tell us what color his eyes were and they said they were bright blue (just like mine). We were fortunate enough to have an AMAZING nurse that was with us around the clock. I honestly don't know how we would have made it through any of it without her. I can never repay her for the care and kindness she showed us. We took TONS of pictures and a NICU nurse also took some for us. We have casts of his hands and feet and some of his hair. Instead of coming home with him we came home with a box and pictures. That is all we have of him.\n\nHe died as a result of a prolapsed cord. His cord was almost completely delivered before he was. Apparently it is extremely rare and our nurse said in her 20 years in L&amp;D she had only seen it happen 1 other time and the result for that poor family was the same. We were told that the only way he could have been saved was if it happened while someone was checking my cervix, and even then it would have likely been the same result as they only would have had less than 10 minutes to get him out while someone was pushing he head back. \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n\nIt's been 3 months and I am just starting to feel a little bit \"better\". I still cry almost every day, but it doesn't feel as overwhelming. We started trying again with the support of my OB and our psychologist (who has probably saved us both from going completely crazy), and I'm currently 7 dpo. We are both extremely worried that we will have to go through the same things to have another child. I have this fear that our son was the only chance we had and he was ripped away. \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nThanks for reading; I'm sorry that we all have to be here, but I am so thankful for a community like this.", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "ttcafterloss", "subreddit_id": "t5_34scd", "subreddit_subscribers": 3715, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Into Post [Stillbirth]", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/ttcafterloss/comments/960zjf/into_post_stillbirth/"}, {"author": "platypuspotatopizza", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1533864711, "domain": "self.ttcafterloss", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/ttcafterloss/comments/962kmw/laparoscopy/", "gilded": 0, "id": "962kmw", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 2, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/ttcafterloss/comments/962kmw/laparoscopy/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1533864712, "score": 1, "selftext": "I just found out that all of my blood work is \u201cnormal,\u201d so the doctor is considering a laparoscopy.

DH and I are on cycle 5, and I had a CP 13 days ago. This was my first known loss. It\u2019s been a weird and sad week, but I feel grateful for my sweet hubby\u2019s support. \n\nI\u2019m wondering when I\u2019m likely to ovulate again. I know some people O pretty much right on schedule. If I still have HCG in my system, would that stop me from ovulating? Or maybe HCG and O are independent from one another?\n\nWhat\u2019s weird is that, 12 days after my CP, I started getting progesterone symptoms\u2014 sore boobs and zits. My body feels like it ovulated. But, I\u2019ve never ovulated before day 16, and usually more like day 18-19. Could the CP have made me ovulate early?? Or maybe these symptoms are related to the CP and not related to post-ovulation progesterone? FWIW, my HCG level was down to 17 on the day I started getting sore breasts and acne. \n\nThanks for any insight you can offer!

If there was any question on whether three weeks time has healed me at all, I can tell you some weeks are worse than others. It's traumatizing to go through this and that trauma can creep up on you. There was a point in time where I thought I had a better handle on my emotions, but then other people starting announcing their pregnancies or complaining about their pregnancy is really killing me.\n\nLast weekend, I went out of town with my pregnant cousin and her sister to meet up with our grandma. This trip was planned before my loss and I wanted to be strong. I knew listening to my cousin talk about her pregnancy was going to be hard. I couldn't have predicted that my cousin would drag us all into a maternity store when she knew what happened to me. That was my breaking point. Moral of the story: Don't try to be strong. Be selfish. Your mental health needs to come first.\n\nAfter this trip, I have felt more dead inside than I have previously. I've been hiding the pregnancy/baby related stuff from my FB newsfeed. I was able to scroll past this stuff before, but I can't do it anymore. I'm allowing myself to put myself first. I owe it to myself to be selfish while I grieve.\n\nPrayers and love to all of you who are going through this as well.

Thank god. \n\n2.20pm: We went home.\n\nSo as I said all in all a good experience, most of the time I spent it in tears before the operation but I was in a fairly good mood after. I've not had to take any painkillers yet and I'm just curled up on the sofa with a hot water bottle, watching a box set.\n\nThank you reddit for your support at this time and thank you for reading.

My husband and I were full of excitement because our DD was just turning one and this was our \u201cideal\u201d age gap. Long story \u201cshort\u201d, I ended up going to the doctor a few weeks before my scheduled 8 week appointment due to cramping and spotting.  They monitored my HCG levels by taking my blood every. Damn. Day. Sometimes twice a day.  Finally after a week of blood being drawn and levels going up but sadly not doubling, they did an ultrasound.  What we saw was an empty sac right there on my Fallopian tube. I was sent straight to triage and given methotrexate.\n\nNow, when the doctor first gave us the official news, we were both shocked and clearly disappointed. She gave us the room, and I started to cry. My husband, who is always way too rational for his own good, told me not to cry because as the doctor sad, there was never really any baby. \n\nA year has come and gone, and we have been trying for another since November. I have taken a test every single month since then and the negative results just get harder and harder to see. \n\nI\u2019ve thought about the ectopic pregnancy every single day. Some days it makes me sad, some days it\u2019s just a fact of life. But lately, I\u2019ve been seeing SOOOO many babies being born and so many pregnancy announcements, it\u2019s just been really getting to me. Today, I straight up broke down. I started to cry and my husband asked if I was okay. When I told him I was sad about not being pregnant, he said we just have to give it time. And when I said I was also really sad about the pregnancy we lost last year, he said I couldn\u2019t be sad about it because it wasn\u2019t really anything to begin with. In his mind, I didn\u2019t lose a baby. I didn\u2019t lose a \u201cpregnancy\u201d. I didn\u2019t lose anything. He even let me know that it wasn\u2019t a miscarriage.... like I wasn\u2019t aware of that. It turned into big thing and we got so far off track that I eventually just decided to drop the whole thing.\n\nI wish he understood my pain. Yeah, there was no \u201creal baby\u201d. But there was still a time in my life last year that I believed there was. I saw the positive test. I felt the nausea. It was short lived, but it happened. This is a weird, grey area I guess. I don\u2019t know anyone else who has experienced this and I don\u2019t have anyone to turn to. So here I am, on the Internet hoping a stranger will understand exactly where I\u2019m coming from and help me to help my husband understand why this is hard and why it hurts me more that he thinks my pain is not real.\n\n\nTL;DR: husband doesn\u2019t understand why previous ectopic was hard because there was \u201cno baby, just a sac\u201d. Need to get him to open his eyes.
