Why tell me this in 1. Public and 2. On friend\u2019s birthday, effectively stealing her birthday thunder and making the conversation about that instead? \n\nShe says she understands I\u2019m upset \u2013 she didn\u2019t know how to tell me. I tell her, No you don\u2019t understand because your baby didn\u2019t die and you already have a son. I lost mine and I never get him back. You get to have a parent experience already. My first baby died. You don\u2019t get it. \n\nIt was the worst dinner ever and I could hardly look at her. She\u2019s knocked up by her ex who is not the best guy and she\u2019s been \u201cdumping\u201d for the last 2 years. He was essentially stalking her for a time. I can hardly stand to see pregnant people.

I took the hit for them, being the 1% so they can all go on to have excellent pregnancies with awesome outcomes. They will prob ask for additional monitoring and everything because of me and my little baby will be buried for all eternity under the ground with all my hopes and dreams. \n\nMy best friend made a painting for my son with a psalm on it and I want to chuck it in the trash.

My sister-in-law is supposed to have my \"trigger baby\" soon.

I am shocked. Obviously statistics are right out the window at this point. Again, the doctors aren't sure there's anything wrong, so I don't know how to go about this. I would like to be supportive, but I'm still grieving and I've been avoiding her for my emotional health. I just honestly don't know. What if the doctors are wrong, and he is fine? It shouldn't be about me. It should be about her baby's life. But all I can think about is that my radiologist had asked for more ultrasound photos of *my* baby's heart when I was pregnant. My doctor told me it was nothing at the time, and he didn't tell me anything strange was found on the redone ultrasounds. But now this? It's horrible, but I keep thinking what if they find what was wrong with my baby is also what's wrong with my SIL's? What if it was something they could have caught? What if they save my nephew? What if my baby could be alive right now? I know this is a tangled mess, but this news has gotten me panicked. I've been doing well with the whole, \"There's nothing I could have done to save him. It just happened.\" But if my nephew survives, which of course I want him to, in my head that means that I really did fail my baby. Emotions everywhere.

I didn't even really want this one!\" and listen to everyone go on about how much fun and how wonderful pregnancy is when they KNOW about both my losses. I know I shouldn't expect everyone to cater to my feelings but at least try to be a bit more sensitive. I also feel like everyone I know is pregnant as well.

So the woman and her mother were ooo-ing and aaaah-ing over her scan photo saying things like \"so that's the baby's head and if you turn the picture this way I think that's it's arm\", and \"oh look Jenny I think that's it's bum sticking up, doesn't that look funny\". \n\nThere was another woman who had a 3 year old girl running around. Her husband was clearly not impressed about being there and was massively engrossed reading a car magazine that he actually snapped at his daughter to leave him alone so he could read. The mother was talking on her phone (letting her daughter run around like a wildling) saying things like \"yeah well I'm sick of being pregnant now, it's too hot to do anything and I wish it would just hurry up and get out\".\n\nSo I know it's not their fault but here I am waiting to be told that the tiny baby (or blob of cells since I was only 6.5 weeks pregnant) has died inside of me for the second time this year, and these woman were acting all smug and superior. I'm not saying they can't be happy but maybe the hospital reception staff could have separate areas for happy pregnancies and sad pregnancies. Or even a sign on the wall perhaps saying \"please be considerate of other people around you, not everyone will be receiving good news today\".\n \nIt made me angry which then made me really upset.

I hope this type of post is allowed.\n\nMy son is two months old and my friend was 30 weeks pregnant. Literally five minutes ago I got a call telling me her baby has passed away. \n\nEarlier in the day she texted me, panicked (like she does with every pregnancy symptom), about decreased fetal movement. I told her than my son had had moments of silence a few times and I went to the ER, and that I would drink a sugary cold drink before hand to see if I could wake him up. She got herself a drink and went on with her day for awhile. I never was updated, but I just figured she was busy. \n\nWell I just got a call telling me she's going in for potentially an emergency c-section to have the baby *removed*...they're using the word *removed*, like she's some sort of tumor inside of my friend. We joked our kids would be married. She was coming to my house in a week to rifle through baby clothes. Her baby shower is in a few days. \n\nI experienced a mid-pregnancy loss before (not as far as 30 weeks, though) so why is it so hard for me to know what to do? I want to scream at the doctors and tell them they're wrong, and I want her to hold her baby when she's born and just see her okay. But that's not going to happen. \n\nI also kinda feel like it's my fault, because I told her to drink a sugary drink when I could've said GO TO THE ER IMMEDIATELY NOW! But would that even have saved her? I don't know. And I'm not going to interrogate my friend about it right now either. Way earlier in the pregnancy I told her I had a \"feeling\" she would be born a little early and we'd see her soon. Now I feel like an ass over that comment. \n\nWhat do I do? I'm visiting without my son asap, which is not right now (nobody's available to watch him short notice at 1am). I'll be at the hospital in the morning to see her. Should I bring something? Ice cream? I'm having my mom watch my son so she doesn't have to be subjected to my healthy baby during this time. WHAT DO I DO?? I am just staring at my son right now feeling guilty that *he's* alive while *she* didn't make it. How is that fair? I'm grateful that my son is alive, but now my friend has to see him for the rest of her life while her baby didn't make it. I offered to babysit her baby. So much is different. I'm rambling. \n\nWhat do I do? Should I visit now with my baby? I don't have anywhere to take him but is it not cruel to bring my healthy son around her? I want to see her, too. Oh my god. \n\nEdit: i definitely can't visit her until the morning.

It has been such a devastating time for us. We have a 2.5 year old daughter who is just now starting to grasp the idea that the baby died-- we have to have a lot of repetitive talks about how he was in mama's tummy, but something happened and he died, so he can't live at home with us. \n\nWe don't know conclusively what went wrong, but my midwife laid out a pretty good case for cord damage-- it was a little frayed, she noticed, when she clamped it, and the amniotic fluid appeared to have a good deal of blood in it.\n\nMy midwife has told me that we can try again after one cycle, if we feel emotionally ready. Our therapist thinks you can be both grieving and pregnant at the same time, so as far as my husband and I are concerned, there's no reason to wait once my period returns.\n\nI'm having a particularly rough day. I'm so sad about my baby. I'm so sad for my little girl, who was so excited to be a big sister. I'm desperate to be pregnant again. I hate all my pregnant friends. I hate everyone who has a baby. I especially hate everyone who has a baby boy. I just want this all to be a terrible dream I'll wake up from soon. I just want my period to show up. (When does that even happen?) I just feel so isolated right now-- the pain is unlike anything those closest to me have ever experienced. \n\nIn addition to feeling every bit of the heartbreak we've endured, today I'm just racked by every fear about the future-- that I'll never be able to get pregnant again, that if I do something horrible will go wrong again, that I'll never have the big family I dream of having.\n\nI don't know.

Seems like most everyone we have talked to were successful on their first try, if not second. \n\nWhen we were looking to connect with parents in the US, it was truly through a network of folks that we got to talk to them to hear about the process, which reassured us that we're not going to be scammed or have trouble bringing our future babies back home. Because of this, just thought I would post here so that you can read about my experience as it happens. I'm super nervous! I will start a blog and try to document everything as much as I can. \n\nAny questions/thoughts/comments welcome! Please send us your positive vibes, we need all of the help we can get, trust us on that one!\n\nTo follow our journey, feel free to follow via [Wordpress] (http://asiu.us/), [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/americansurrogacyinukraine/), or [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/americansurrogacyinukraine/).", "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "ttcafterloss", "subreddit_id": "t5_34scd", "suggested_sort": null, "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Pursuing surrogacy after 3 losses in a row~!", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/ttcafterloss/comments/6j05ug/pursuing_surrogacy_after_3_losses_in_a_row/"}, {"approved_at_utc": null, "author": "marrymegilfoyle", "author_created_utc": 1498054206, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_text": null, "author_fullname": "t2_4pytuqx", "banned_at_utc": null, "brand_safe": false, "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1498242225, "domain": "self.ttcafterloss", "edited": 1498445023, "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/ttcafterloss/comments/6j31xu/should_i_see_an_re/", "gilded": 0, "id": "6j31xu", "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "locked": false, "media_embed": {}, "num_comments": 4, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/ttcafterloss/comments/6j31xu/should_i_see_an_re/", "retrieved_on": 1500174043, "score": 7, "secure_media_embed": {}, "selftext": "Hi all, I've lurked on here for a while and have found all the support very encouraging.

First timer here.\n\nThis was my first pregnancy, and I had a ruptured ectopic 4 weeks ago tomorrow. We were on the way to a concert when I had sudden horrible pain and my husband called 911 in the car after I passed out. I was about 7 weeks pregnant and had had zero signs of an ectopic before it ruptured.\n\nI ended up getting my left tube removed that night and lost a liter of blood. My HCG levels were 360 a week after surgery, and then they were 35 a week ago, but I just got a call from my doctor today saying the blood work from yesterday is still exactly the same at 35. He said it was a little concerning, and it could be left over tissue, but it also could have just plateaued before dropping... So he wants to draw my blood again next Wednesday before trying a methotrexate injection.\n\nHas this every happened to anyone else?\n\nHas anyone ever experience HCG levels staying the same like this for a whole week and then dropping? I'm about to go on a week long vacation and was really looking forward to feeling back to as normal as possible so I can enjoy my time with my family after having such a horrible past month.\n\nAlso, I know I am still recovering, and I was feeling great besides some tenderness at the incisions until last night when I was leaving my appointment to have blood drawn and got TERRIBLE pains that resembled gas pains. I say that it resembled gas pains, but I'm really not sure. It just hurts in my lower abdomen, but it isn't a sharp stabbing pain. It feels as if my entire lower abdomen is hurting and bloating and it came on suddenly. It kept me in bed for a couple hours last night.\n\nI just keep telling myself there is nothing down there to rupture again, so I should be fine, but honestly.... every little pain in that area gives me anxiety now. And it really freaks my husband out because he said he thought I was dying in the car the night I passed out :(\n\nEdit: I am getting over a self-diagnosed yeast infection, which I have been using an over the counter cream on for the past 3 days. It no longer itches or bothers me like it did 3 days ago, so I'm assuming that has nothing to do with my pain.

Brown medium bleeding which has become lighter in flow recently but is there every time I visit the loo for 10 consecutive days now.\n\nHad a private scan and a NHS scan a couple days after the bleeding started and neither could see anything at all. I've had bloods taken every 48hours which have detected the hcg level has increased every time. They have increased from 4400 to 7000 to 7600 and today 11800. Had another scan on Friday and although ovaries looked perfect, the technician did see a \"void\" area in my uterus which could either be the start of a gestation sac (which would be 3weeks behind schedule for a normal pregnancy) or simply a small blood clot waiting to pass.\n\nConsultant now wants another scan done tomorrow morning and there has been talks of a laparoscopy procedure if the scan is still inconclusive. I'm not in any pain or having any pregnancy symptoms at all and I'm 100% certain I have my cycle/ovulation/positive result dates totally accurate.

But surely the size of the gestation sac would still be too small for this far along in a pregnancy as I'm meant to be 8w tomorrow. \n\nAnybody had a similar experience? I'm thinking more towards the ectopic theory but surely I'd be in some pain?

I never in a million years thought I'd be here myself. Yet here I am.\n\nI wanted to post our story as I have found comfort reading other experiences, knowing I'm not alone. You all seem like such a supportive group of people. \n\nOn the 9th of June I finished work at 8pm. I'd felt my little boy moving all day, nothing out of the ordinary. That evening he was a little quieter than usual, but he had periods of being quiet so I didn't think much of it. Me and my partner got some fish and chips for dinner as I didn't feel like cooking. We chilled out on the sofa, I fell asleep and eventually we headed to bed around midnight. I didn't feel him move so I laid on my left side when we went to bed to try and feel some kicks - I must've fallen asleep like this, but still wasn't worried because he was quiet sometimes.\n\nIn the night I got up to pee around 4am. Again, no kicks. Usually he would kick me when I got up because I'd drink some water after peeing. This time, nothing. Got some cold juice, gave my bump a few prods...still nothing. Got in bed to try some counts. Nothing.\n\nAround 6am I'd had enough. Something definitely wasn't right. I remember sitting in the lounge pleading with him to kick. Telling him he could kick me constantly or give me the dreaded lightning crotch as much as he wanted if he'd just wake up and kick me. I called the hospital and they told me to have some breakfast and a drink, that they were sure that by the time I came in for monitoring my boy would be kicking up a storm for me. \n\nI drove to the hospital as my partner doesn't drive. I really wasn't even letting myself worry too much at this point, because we's always said we had a troll baby on our hands who liked to mess with us.\n\nWe arrived at the hospital and were seen immediately by a lovely midwife. Took us to a room and she got the Doppler out. She was trying for a very long time to find his heartbeat, which was mega unusual. I'd just had a routine midwife appointment on the Thursday (this was Saturday) and my midwife never had a problem finding his heartbeat. At the appointment on Thursday she said everything sounded perfect, he was happy and healthy.\n\nAnyway, first midwife says she needs to get the senior midwife to try and find it. She didn't say anything else but I turned to my partner and said she couldn't find the heartbeat...but again, I was trying not to panic. Second midwife comes in, again can't find it.\n\nTells us she needs to get a doctor to do an ultrasound. We were left alone for 10 minutes while this was arranged. By this point I was crying. I said to my partner that maybe he was in some distress or something and they could wheel me in for a c section then and there if needed...holding on to any hope that our baby was still alive in there.\n\nThe first doctor comes in, finds our boy. And there it was...We could clearly see our little boy's still heart. I let him poke around for a minute and said to him \"there isn't a heartbeat is there?\". He was very quiet then says he's sorry, there isn't a heartbeat. Another doctor is brought in to confirm everything.\n\nWe were hysterical. Inconsolable. I said I needed my mum, so I call her. All I could manage to say was \"mum, I've lost the baby.\" She sounded so broken. This is the second time she's heard this - my brother and SIL lost their first little boy at 26 weeks a few years ago. \n\nSo, we go through everything with the doctors. I was given the pill to ripen my cervix, told to come back if labour started, or Monday at 9am. 2 days to process things, to carry my still baby. \n\nNothing happened and I was admitted on Monday. Given the pills to try and induce labour - nothing worked. By Wednesday the 14th I was started on a drip and eventually gave birth to George at 5:08pm, weighing 6lb1oz. \n\nI needed stitches because his head had deteriorated due to the long labour and I couldn't push him out. The midwife took him away (as per our wishes), then showed him to us. He was beautiful, but his skin was peeling off by this point and his head was...not right. We were moved into the bereavement suite and our families came to say their goodbyes. We consented to a post mortem, so if there was a reason hopefully we'll find out.\n\nNow I'm just empty. So empty. Life feels completely unfair. Everything was perfect until suddenly it wasn't. I didn't have a high risk pregnancy, I flew through every appointment. I have such an unbelievable need for my baby. \n\nMy family are all so supportive of us. My partner is wonderful and I think this will bring us even closer together. I hated every minute of pregnancy (HG, awful heartburn, swelling, hip and back pain...you name it). And honestly, he was a complete accident. I was devastated when I found out I was pregnant, but quickly came round to the idea of being a mum. We were so excited to become a family of three. \n\nI told my partner I need to think another baby asap. Not to replace our George, but to pour my love into. I hope my periods become normal soon, but I want to try and wait until at least September before trying, and getting the all clear from the doctor. \n\nWhat are your experiences of trying after a stillborn? I'm lucky that I am still entitled to a full year of maternity leave. My employer pays full salary for 18 weeks so I'm going to use that time to grieve and get healthy and start thinking about trying. Am I being mad thinking about trying in such a short time frame? My mind is just all over the place. \n\nThanks for reading and I'm sorry for the wall of text! I guess I just needed to get it all out.\n\n", "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "ttcafterloss", "subreddit_id": "t5_34scd", "suggested_sort": null, "thumbnail": "self", "title": "New here.

When it happened, my older sister was already 3 months pregnant, and although it's been tough celebrating all the milestones with her, because I was already used to the idea and steeling myself to still be there for her and happy for her, it wasn't so bad.\n\nBut then, I got the news last night: my sister-in-law is 7 weeks pregnant. This was totally unexpected, because they weren't planning to try for another year or two until my brother-in-law is out of grad school. Although they say it was a \"surprise,\" I have a feeling that our pregnancy news (we told them the day we found out) may have spurred them on. Anyway - I am and want to be happy for them, but it's so hard, you guys. I never thought I'd be that person who cries when they find out someone else's happy news, but that was me: fetal position on the bed, and today just feeling dead inside. \n\nI know you've all been there, and I guess I'm just looking for advice. Is there anything else that heals but time? I so desperately want to be pregnant, but I haven't even ovulated in the 5 weeks since my MC (and I'm not even planning to try this cycle as per doctor's advice), so this is all feeling like the longest journey. \n\nNothing feels more unfair than someone else unexpectedly getting pregnant, and to know that they hid it from you and pity you. I had been making progress every week, making peace with it, lighting a candle every night and talking to our lost friend, and now I feel like I'm back at the beginning and might never feel better. \n\nLove to all of you, thanks for being here. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "ttcafterloss", "subreddit_id": "t5_34scd", "suggested_sort": null, "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Both sisters pregnant...setback", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/ttcafterloss/comments/6kg0oo/both_sisters_pregnantsetback/"}, {"approved_at_utc": null, "author": "PloupPloup83", "author_created_utc": 1449914066, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_text": null, "author_fullname": "t2_svqc2", "banned_at_utc": null, "brand_safe": false, "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1498834515, "domain": "self.ttcafterloss", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/ttcafterloss/comments/6kgew5/pap_smear_miscarriage/", "gilded": 0, "id": "6kgew5", "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "locked": false, "media_embed": {}, "num_comments": 7, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/ttcafterloss/comments/6kgew5/pap_smear_miscarriage/", "retrieved_on": 1500198477, "score": 5, "secure_media_embed": {}, "selftext": "Just had a random thought.
