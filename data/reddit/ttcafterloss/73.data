I had my miscarriage about a month and a half ago. My husband and I were so excited at our first ultrasound, but sadly it did not go as imagined. I was supposed to be 9 weeks pregnant, but the ultrasound showed only a yolk sac. When the ultrasound technician told us, my husband almost threw up and I burst into tears. After we were given a few minutes to grieve by ourselves, the doctor came in and gave us our options. Since I was worried about the cost of a D&amp;C as my husband and I are both federal employees and this was during the shutdown, we opted for the pills. I took them that night before bed and I woke up several hours later with really bad cramps, but only a little blood. I took some ibuprofen and went back to sleep. An hour and a half later, I woke up to the feeling of tissue sliding out of me. I rushed to the toilet and an alarming amount of blood and tissue exited my body. I started freaking out and woke my husband up. We decided to go to the ER because I was starting to get dizzy and it was a LOT of blood. At the ER, I had to sit on an incontinence pad in the hospital bed. I also had to wear an adult diaper on my way to and from the restroom so I wouldn't leave a blood trail on the floor. It was awful. I had a pelvic exam, an ultrasound, and another pelvic exam before the doctors decided that I needed a D&amp;C after all. I only had a little bleeding after the D&amp;C. I healed up well physically, but emotionally I'm still raw. My husband doesn't want to talk about it, but he comforts me when I need it. I'm seeing a psychologist now, so that's going well, and I'm working through it. My doctor said we have to wait 3 months to try again, so we still have another month and a half to wait.\n\nToday I finally got my first period post-miscarriage, and I have some questions. Was your first period post-miscarriage an unusual color or consistency? Mine is basically like egg white cervical mucus with blood mixed in and it's a pinkish color. Normally, my period is dark red and mostly liquid. It's been 45 days since my D&amp;C, which is about two weeks longer than a normal cycle for me. How long did it take for your cycles to get back to normal?", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "ttcafterloss", "subreddit_id": "t5_34scd", "subreddit_subscribers": 4753, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Intro &amp; questions", "updated_utc": 1553976746, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/ttcafterloss/comments/awud3d/intro_questions/"}, {"author": "emmross", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_afe4en6", "author_patreon_flair": false, "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1551628444, "domain": "self.ttcafterloss", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/ttcafterloss/comments/awv7gz/90_sure_im_going_through_a_chemical_but_would/", "gildings": {"gid_1": 0, "gid_2": 0, "gid_3": 0}, "id": "awv7gz", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 5, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/ttcafterloss/comments/awv7gz/90_sure_im_going_through_a_chemical_but_would/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1551628445, "score": 1, "selftext": "Hey guys! \n\nI discovered I was pregnant on 2/22 at 11 dpo with a FRER.

I have a few questions about my recent missed miscarriage. The tl;dr version is:\n\nWent for ultrasound at nearly 9 weeks. Told baby was 7 weeks, no heartbeat. Waited 6 days. Another ultrasound. No growth. Confirmed fetal demise. \n\nWas given misoprostol &amp; mifepristone. Had a *really* good experience with it. Lots of bleeding, lots of clots, pretty sure I passed the pregnancy tissue. I also passed a clot so big (looked like another regular blood clot, didn\u2019t look like any product of conception) it gave me labor pain. No joke. It was awful. However, minimal side effects!\n\nMy doctors have said I do not need a follow up ultrasound. Is this true? I was told to take a urine preg test at home 3 weeks after the misoprostol dose. I\u2019m anxious there will be retained products of conception left over. If I get a negative test, am I safe to assume all good? No more beta blood tests. \n\nMy doctors also said to wait 2 weeks before having sex again. I have read you can do it when the bleeding stops. What if my bleeding stops in a few days? Which is true/safer?\n\nMy husband wants to use condoms until I get my next period, for dating purposes so we don\u2019t get pregnant and end up super confused. However I am going to try charting my temperatures.

Please help me prepare for the invasive curiosity and opinions of my family and friends, internet strangers &lt;3  \n\n\nHi,\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI had a D&amp;E four days ago at 22+6, and everything seemed to go well. I had a week between the suggestion that something was wrong and the confirmation, and then two weeks to say goodbye to my baby girl between the diagnosis and the surgery.  I am a very strong person, with a fantastic support system and the wisdom to use it when I need to, and a lot of experience in dealing with difficult emotional events. I am very sad that I couldn't bring my daughter into this world alive, but I am grateful for the time I did have with her, and I will keep my happy memories with me always. I believe that death is only difficult for the people who are left behind, and knowing that my daughter is at peace brings me peace. I also believe that no one wants their loved ones to suffer, so the best way for me to honor her is to go on loving my life and being the best mother, best wife, and best person I can be.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy husband and I feel that we are ready to TTC a sibling for our 1.5 y.o. son again right away, and my doctor says that there is no medical reason that we should abstain. I can understand how it would make people uncomfortable that we would try again so soon. The death of a baby affects people very strongly, very personally. I absolutely accept everyone else's right to feel however they feel about our loss. I know that our decision to start TTC so soon after our loss will probably offend some people and worry others silly. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIn defense of our decision, our doctor okayed it, and our midwives aren't concerned. I am a healthy person who does all the good things in moderation, no drinking, no smoking, and I'm taking my folic acid. I'm ready to try again once my cervix feels strong again. I can feel this desire coming from somewhere really deep, and my instincts all say it's okay. I don't feel guilty, or like I'm trying to \"replace\" my baby. After asking my husband several times about his true feelings about trying to conceive right away, he shared that he wants to have our babies close together so we're done with diapers faster. He is a wonderful loving man, but he doesn't like talking about his feelings. Knowing him, I feel that what he means is he's ready, and he wants me to stop pestering him about how he feels about it. It's a well felt, well thought through decision, and I am sure that we are ready. And I am sure that if we go on to have some early miscarriages, or even a repeat of the circumstances that led to the abortion of our sweet girl (so unlikely), we will be okay.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy problem is that I don't want everyone involved in the next part of our journey. People are already starting to pry. A couple of people have already figured out, because I didn't confirm or deny that we were going to wait a while and they know that if we were I would just tell them. I am feeling some anger towards one of them for her \"it's not my place but I would\" comment, and am anticipating that she will bring it up obsessively to try to change my mind, which will make me even angrier. I really, really don't want to be angry.   \n\n\nThanks for reading.

So far:\n\n-I ordered a book called Not Broken. Heard it has research about loss. \n-Wrote down an action plan for how I\u2019m going to stay on top of work during the loss, plus goals for the future to increase financial freedom. \n-Wrote down possible supplements and exercise plan I can try for trying to get healthy again. (Right now I\u2019m just indulging) The thought of trying again sounds so overwhelming, but at the same time I want to look forward to it. \n\nIs there anything else that helped you? I\u2019m afraid what this \u201cnew normal\u201d means for me. I became TTC crazy after my last loss, determined that I would get my rainbow baby. Everything was around TTC.

I'm looking for advice, experiences, opinions, links to good articles, anything you have. I will absolutely ask every professional I can about it, but I want to think about it from as many angles as I can. I can't ask my friends or family, I want them to \\*stop\\* thinking about my uterus.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSome Background: My first pregnancy ended in a healthy baby at age 26. One year later, after two pretty average cycles, I was pregnant again. I MC'd at 6 weeks. I became pregnant immediately after, no cycle in between. It was discovered that my little girl had serious abnormalities and we term!nated at 23 weeks. That was 8 days ago. My doctor said there is no medical reason to wait if my husband and I feel ready, and maybe it seems wrong, but we do. We want to give our son a sibling who is close in age if we can.  \n\n\nI don't intend to tell anyone (other than my doctor and midwives) that we want to TTC again right away, and I hope to hide my next pregnancy for as long as possible to keep people out of my hair about it. I feel strongly about my decision, it feels right. But I keep getting advice to wait - not that I'm asking!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy MIL told me that I should wait to make sure everything clears out and resets. My friend told me that having pregnancies too close together can cause genetic defects because the eggs might be released immaturely due to my hormones being unbalanced or out of practice, a theory for which I don't see any support (go go google-fu) but which totally freaks me out. My grandmother told me that my MC one year after giving birth to a healthy son was because I didn't wait long enough to get pregnant again.  \n\n\nI want to trust my doctor and my instincts, but I also want to make an educated decision.

He had no heart beat when I got to the hospital he was just gone. We waited 6 weeks. Then I had some bleeding issues for a month. Finally, I started with OPKs just to see what my body was doing. Was I having periods? Ovulating? I was. Last month I got positive pregnancy tests for a weekend and Sunday night started bleeding. I watched my lines disappear. Today it\u2019s been 28 days. Most my life my period has started on a Sunday. Losing my baby (CP) last month on Sunday had me on edge today. \n\nI\u2019m 9DPO although my peak lasted a long time so I was unsure if I\u2019m 8 or 9dpo. I showed positives at 9dpo last time that darkened. I checked my tests which are negative but I ovulated late CD20 probably with a strong LH positive ovulation cramps EWCM etc. \n\nI had some spotting today dark brown. Cramps. A little background I had bad cramps and bleeding off and on the first 15 weeks of my pregnancy and thought I lost Oliver over and over. I had some dark spotting when I got pregnant with him. We weren\u2019t trying at the time so I thought based on our BD that there was no way we could be pregnant. I had dark spotting a day or two and tons of cramps so I thought my period was just off / light but coming soon. I found out less than 2 weeks later I was pregnant. \n\nSo I\u2019m sitting here. Cramping. Waiting for aunt flow. Waiting to be out this month. Hating my BFN tests. I know it\u2019s early. But I have brown spotting. And I\u2019m just hurting. And my partner doesn\u2019t understand how it feels for my body to betray me like this. He didn\u2019t have a c section. He wants another baby but he doesn\u2019t have to carry it! He doesn\u2019t have to question if he can have a glass of wine even though it\u2019s probably another month with no baby. I either want my period to start or I want a BFP. I hate limbo. I hate ovulating late. I always have a 28 day cycle but ovulate late! So I bleed when it\u2019s too early too really know. Short luteal phases suck! \n\nIt\u2019s almost 4am and I don\u2019t want to go to sleep. I\u2019m scared I\u2019m going to wake up to blood every where and I\u2019ll let it ruin my day off. I hate this. So I\u2019m sitting here waiting. Tired but can\u2019t sleep. Waiting for what feels like the inevitable. I\u2019ve mentally counted myself out this month but not enough to have a glass of wine to relax my nerves. I don\u2019t know how many months of this I can handle. I just came here to borrow the strength of the strong women on this sub that have gone through this for months or years TTC knowing what it\u2019s like to lose a baby.

At my last US my MFM saw something suspicious in my uterus and wanted to get a hysteroscopy after my D+E. I had the scope done last week and they found what is either a septum or signs of a bicornuate (heartshaped) uterus. I see the RE in April to further diagnose which we are dealing with.\nIt sounds like this has absolutely nothing to do with what was wrong with our baby, and is just another unlucky fluke. \nI would love to hear if anyone has had a septate uterus, and possibly had surgery to correct? Also anyone with a bicornuate uterus, and what has TTC or subsequent pregnancies been like? I am assuming lots of monitoring is in my future (which it is anyway due to our loss). \nI am so disheartened. We we're supposed to get the all clear to TTC after the scope, it was supposed to be the last test before we knew we were safe to try again. No I'm going down another rabbit hole and am in limbo again. It feels like time is going so slow.
