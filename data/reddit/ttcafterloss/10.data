It was our \"plan\". Then I somehow got pregnant, on birth control, in February of this year...I found out in March and we were SO excited. Our entire lives changed in that moment.\n\nUnfortunately, my 10w4d ultrasound did not give me good news. There was no heartbeat. =/\n\nThe baby was measuring exactly 10w4d so they think it was an incredibly recent occurrence (within 24 hours). It was a complete shock, as I had NO miscarriage symptoms and plenty of 1st trimester sickness/\"fun\". I just thought things were moving right along...I didn't even know what to think and spent many hours crying. My husband was out of town and that just added to the horrible day.\n\nThe doctors said it could take quite awhile for my body to realize the loss and for things to happen naturally. I spent 4 more days, knowing the baby wasn't growing and feeling pregnant and then I chose to have the D&amp;C.  I had that on May 5th, and while I hated it, I am glad I did it. It allowed my body to start getting back to normal sooner, which I think helped me emotionally.\n\nYesterday was the 3 month anniversary of that ultrasound...and a hard reminder. I think about our baby often and milestones really hurt. Different communities here on Reddit have been helpful, and unfortunately I know a lot of women who have had a loss and can relate. \n\nWe both decided to go back to our \"original plan\" and wait until next spring. For a few reasons, a big one being my emotional state. But lately I have realized I just don't want that. Having carried a baby already, I want to do so again quite a lot. We talked, and decided that we want to do a few things before a kid and picked a date to start. SO - we're going on a 3 week vacation in October. And I'm stopping birth control the week before we leave!\n\nI keep thinking that if it happened that \"easily\" before, that maybe it will again and I'll be pregnant right away...but I know that isn't likely and I should quell that thought so I don't get too letdown. I am just happy that we've decided to try! \n\nAll of you ladies are so strong and this subreddit offers such a great community. Thanks for being that for each other (and now me).

I desperately need to get these thoughts out somewhere, so I am so relieved to have found a place entirely for what we are going through.\n\nMy husband and I have lost two pregnancies, one at 7 weeks a couple years ago, and another in April. They were both surprises, although the first was less excited about. Timing was absolutely terrible, but not the second time. It seemed to be bad timing, with my husband leaving his military career along with our insurance and an impending move across the globe from Europe, but we were thrilled!! We changed our plans from moving to a new state to going back home to help us ride out a baby with family around. I registered for baby gear under an alias before telling our families, and really just to price how much we'd need to be prepared for before losing our jobs. We only told our closest friends and our parents, and both my best friend in Europe and my best friend at home were both pregnant with me! Expecting within a week of each other!\n\nThen came that dreaded appointment, which was very unclear with a minor language barrier, but to the effect of \"yeah.... I don't think it's viable. Brace yourself for a miscarriage. Bye!\" No certainty or reliability at all. Mind you, I was told at 6 weeks that it might be ectopic.... It wasn't. I had no faith in my doctor and extremely limited options in a foreign country. I was told to wait two to three weeks to come back, and that it should be gone by then. \"Should\". Like it better not be there when you come back! I was horrified and in denial and depressed. For three weeks. All the while hearing about how sick my friends are and everything looks great and early 3D ultra sounds. I wanted to cry. So I did. Everyday for at least a month.\n\nIt eventually happened naturally, which just made it harder. I wish I could have been confident in my doctor's opinion and been able to heal faster with a D&amp;C. \n\nNow we're home, and I started a new job with benefits a month ago. It's been 3 cycles of me desperately wanting to replace what feels to have been robbed from me. My husband could wait, and I wish I could but I just can't. I've only taken 4 per stick tests in my life and they were all positive. I know my body, and in a crazy pms mood I thought maybe I could just take one a little early and it will just be positive like all the others. Because it could be! Ridiculous, but hopeful. Either way, I went all out and bought a 3 pack. 2 down. Not pregnant. There goes my \"logic\". I keep thinking this is the cycle!! Not the previous two, but this one!! I'm ready again, we're settled, it can happen and I need it to for my own mental and emotional well being! We already know we're crazy fertile. I hate this. I want my baby back. I'd be 23 weeks today. My clothes are still in storage and I'm getting them back on Thursday and I'm terrified of the emotions that will come out when I see the maternity clothes I bought while we still had income.\n\nDidn't mean for this to be a novella, but this shit sucks and I cant be as patient as I'm told. Wish I could, but it's only driving me deeper into insanity. This isn't who I want to be. I mourned this person when I was pregnant and I embraced the mother inside of me.

But I have a very difficult time helping her deal with her current anxiety.\n\nShe's worried that we will loose a second pregnancy. She's not sure she would be able to take it, and fears she would break completely if it happens again. She's also worried that she will become an overprotective mother, even if we succeed in having our child.\n\nI've explained to her that it's extremely unlikely that it will happen the same way again, and that part of loving your child is letting them explore the world on their own. It's natural to worry about another loss, but her high level of anxiety doesn't match up with the actual risks. I want to put her mind more at ease, because some days it's all she can think about. The \"What if\".\n\nSo I'm wondering if anyone have found any thoughts, or any anecdotes or advice that has helped them come to terms with the fear of having it happen again.

A few months ago, my husband brought up the idea of getting started on another baby. I was lukewarm to the idea because our daughter still nurses, still cosleeps, and is a kind of needy kid -- I thought maybe we should wait until she was older and more independent. But I also thought it would take a while to get pregnant, maybe 6 months-ish, and then the pregnancy itself lasts for a while.\n\nAnd then before we had even formally started trying, I got a positive test -- we were being pretty lax with protection but I thought it was very unlikely we would get pregnant (sex 5 days before ovulation).\n\nIt was hard for me to get excited about the pregnancy at first, which I now feel incredibly guilty about. I felt like I wasn't ready, my daughter wasn't ready, I wasn't sure what to do about work and money and blah blah everything. So I spent 2 months acclimating to the idea, getting myself a little excited, and explaining things to my daughter.\n\nThen at my 12 week scan, we found a missed miscarriage (lots of details in my submission history, I seem to be unable to stop talking about this on reddit). I had a D&amp;C last Wednesday and feel fine physically. But very sad. \n\nThe pregnancy was very unpleasant (another thing I feel guilty about now) and I am anxious to get the next horrible first trimester behind me.

I was 4 days short of when my hospital would have considered them viable. They each lived only minutes. This is by far the hardest thing I have ever gone through in my life, and I miss my babies more than anything. I would do anything to bring them back.\n\nIt took me 9 years (10 years in November), multiple surgeries and procedures, and IVF/FET to finally conceive them (I also had 4 early losses during that time). Pregnancy does NOT come easily to me, as I have a multitude of things wrong with me reproductive-wise.\n\nThe two paths that we are considering taking going forward: \n\nTransabdominal cerclage: All doctors involved in my case (RE/OB/MFM) have stated that I would need a TAC (as opposed to a TVC) if I were to ever get pregnant again. I have a phone consultation scheduled with a specialist (Dr. Haney) on the 12th of this month. Based on his email correspondence with me, I would need above and beyond a normal TAC - I would need 3 bands placed instead of 1. He said that since this is less common, success rates are harder to determine, but he stated an approximate success rate of 90%. Now, my concern is that the shit that tends to happen to me is in the 1-2% probability range. A 10% chance of something happening is huge to me. How can I risk something like what happened with the twins happening again? Has anyone looked into and/or gotten a TAC?\n\nSurrogacy: We would prefer surrogacy at this point (take my stupid broken body out of the equation completely), but it's very expensive. We are looking at around $60,000 for an independent, non-agency agreement. We got rid of two cars, moved in with my parents so that we can sell our house, and I'm getting a second job - but even then I would need to take out a huge personal loan to be able to make this happen.\n\nI just wish none of this ever happened and that my babies were still safe inside of me.

I've been on here for a few days after having my first pregnancy end in miscarriage on July 30th. It's only been a few days, but in those few days, I've received so much support from this subreddit. I work part-time and I found out about my miscarriage right before the weekend, so I've had a lot of time to sit, think, and read online about this awful side of pregnancy. I found that I wanted to read everyone's story and I've wanted to find people who have had this happen to them (no one I'm close to has had this happen to them or has talked openly about it, so I've clung to the Internet and to this subreddit for solace).\n\nSince I wanted to read about it, I decided I'd post my own story in case someone else feels like I do. \n\nMy husband and I have been married for 4 years and together for 9. He finished his PhD in '13, we had our big ceremony wedding that fall, and then in early '14 we moved to our new town and he started his job. He's 33, I'm almost 32, so we finally thought it was time to start. I just went to Ireland with my mom in May, so I made a point to wait to start until I got back from that trip (Guinness and Galway Hooker beers!) I had said for almost a year to anyone who asked, \"I think we're going to start in June.\"\n\nOne day (June 7th) my husband suggested we try without a condom. I've been using a period tracker app on my phone and it said my fertile window was starting the next day, so I felt like I *could* get pregnant, but there would be a bigger chance that I wouldn't. \n\nHowever, that cycle I just felt like I was pregnant. My small boobs were feeling fuller, but I hadn't missed my period yet. On the 23rd of June, I looked into the mirror and said \"I'm going to be a mom.\" Then I thought, \"Why can't I just test now? Maybe I can.\" I googled the earliest you could test, and since I was in that window, I took the test. BFP! Shocked, excited, nervous about an impending business my husband and I were going to start (we ended up not doing it), I ran to reddit and thus started my obsession with r/babybumps. \n\nI was on there every day, multiple times a day (look at my history). Part of me was proud, but also shocked, that it took me and my husband ONE TRY on the FIRST TRY to get pregnant. That was the history with my mom and dad, and since my maiden name rhymes with fertile, my husband and I were making a joke that I was still Fertile - Lastname.\n\nI was having a rainbow pregnancy. Big, but not sore, boobs, mild-to-severe fatigue, and that was it. A large part of me was concerned and pessimistic that this was really possible. After puking once at 8 weeks, I thought I was going to be ok. \n\nAt my 8 week appointment (I was actually 8w5d), my OBGYN told me I was measuring small. I opted out of the ultrasound because I felt it was too early and I had a high deductible. Her telling me I felt small made me worry, but I brushed it aside because I was low-risk and I since I have a tilted uterus, I felt like she couldn't feel all of it anyway.\n\nA week later, I taught an Italian cooking class late into the night, and came home to a bit of old blood when I wiped. I was concerned, but since I had been on r/babybumps all the time, I knew a bit of breakthrough bleeding was normal and nothing to worry about. I called my mom, who's a nurse, and she talked me down too, stating that I was just at the time where I would be missing my 2nd period, so there wasn't really anything to be too worried about. I felt better and went to bed.\n\nThe next day, Thursday, there didn't seem to be anything there. I went to work without a panty-liner, and went about my day. However, a bit of old blood was staining my underwear. Annoyed, but not concerned, I got a liner from a co-worker and went back to work. When I got home, however, a large clot came out and I started wiping red blood. My husband was out with a friend mountain biking, so I couldn't talk to him, so I called my mom and she tried to reassure me that it was probably ok - maybe my placenta had torn a bit but that happens. After about an hour, I went back to the bathroom and even more red blood was there. Now I was really starting to freak out.\n\nI sent my husband a text message and called him. I then called the friend he was with. That friend answered and when he realized I was crying, he passed the phone to my husband. My husband went immediately to worse case scenario, thinking I was hurt or something and he couldn't understand what I was saying, so he told me he was coming home. When he drove down the street I could see that he was speeding and he quickly parked on the sidewalk and ran up to the house. \n\nI wasn't as freaked as he was, so I tried to explain to him what was happening, and then HE urged me to go to the ER. I was apprehensive at first, but he convinced me and he, his friend, and I went to the ER. \n\nWe arrived at 9pm and they hooked me up to an IV and they drew my blood. I was pessimistic and sure I was miscarrying, but my husband and his friend were trying to reassure me everything was fine. The doctor was a big burly guy and he was saying it was probably something with the placenta and hopefully everything would be ok. After talking to him I felt better and was able to laugh a bit with my husband and his friend.\n\nFinally they wheeled me into the ultrasound room where the nurse looked and really questioned my LMP and EDD. She flatly stated that I looked like I was 5 weeks, which reminded me of what my OBGYN stated a week earlier and solidified my fear that I had lost the baby. I said to her \"That's impossible, I knew I was pregnant 5 weeks ago, I'm definitely 9w5d.\" and she responded coldly, \"Well, I'm just reading the ultrasound and what I see here.\" \n\nThen she did the transvaginal ultrasound and when I craned my neck to see, she said she was only doing the doctor pictures first - which made me think that she'd show me other pictures once she was done with them. She didn't - which *further* solidified my feelings of a MC. Then the radiologist came in, asked her to show him certain angles and whatnot, and didn't talk to me or explain to me what was happening.\n\nHe explained that my doctor in the ER would go over the results and I flatly said \"Ok.\" I thought, \"Just tell me I fucking miscarried.\" I was crying when we got back to the ER and I was just destroyed.\n\nMy husband was still optimistic. I don't know why...probably to make me feel better...but I knew.\n\nAfter what seemed like ages, my doctor finally came in and explained to me that I had indeed miscarried. He said something about there being an insufficient heartbeat and that I would miscarry soon. The way he said it though seemed like the baby was still alive, but I was going to miscarry. I know that's not what he meant, but that's how it sounded. My husband's first language isn't English, but he is VERY FLUENT. However, he did not understand fully because it was a little confusing, and he said to me after the pelvic exam, \"So there's still hope?\" I was just crushed that even though he was there with me, I still had to say in precise terms that we were losing our baby.\n\nWe left the hospital around 1:30am. I don't know how I got to sleep that night, but when I woke up the next morning, I was crying again. I sobbed in the bathroom like I never have before. \n\nAt 2pm I had to go to the OBGYN office to meet with them and to discuss my options. The doctor said that the baby was actually measuring 7w5d, instead of 4 or 5 weeks like they had said at the ER. I was really shocked by this - that means I lost the baby around July 17th or 18th. I opted to MC naturally, which was also what the doctor suggested. The doctor explained that I would have heavy bleeding and cramping in the next few days, and that I was to meet with her a week later to see how things had progressed.\n\nAs I was driving home (only about 10 minute drive) I started to get very intense cramps. I started to breath heavily to ease the cramps - almost like they teach you in those Lamaze classes.\n\nWhen I got home I had the most intense cramps of my life. I couldn't lie down, I couldn't stand, all I could do was sit on the toilet to feel any kind of relief. I tried to do some computer work, but I was in so much pain it was crazy. I didn't realize that I was having labor pains because I never went though labor, but now looking back I can totally see that my cervix was opening and I was trying to pass the baby.\n\nMy mom suggested that I put a heating pad on my belly - so I did that and laid on the couch and watched a bit of tv. I finally felt better, so I got up and went to the kitchen to do some dishes. As I was doing the dishes, I felt a weird sensation in my vagina, like I had just passed a huge clot onto my pad. I thought \"Wow, that was huge, I should go to the bathroom.\" I went to the bathroom, and the baby was there. \n\nI can tell you I was SHOCKED. I had just learned YESTERDAY that I was losing the baby. I yelled \"Omigod, omigod\" and I scooped it up and brought it to the kitchen. Indeed, I was a little under 8 weeks. I had been religiously following my Pregnancy+ app, and it looked just like the little fetus on week 7. The thing that kills me is that the baby looked fine. Yes, it was just barely out of the tadpole stage, but it was out of it with little tiny legs and little webbed hands - and a mouth. I couldn't believe the mouth.\n\nI frantically called my husband who said he was coming home soon, and then I went online to see *what to do* with my tiny baby. Since we're renting, I didn't want to bury it in our backyard, and I didn't want to think of it outside in the ground. I decided, with my husband, to bury him or her in our gorgeous jade plant that looks like a tree. I said a few words and my husband cried. My husband isn't a crier, so it moved me and made it all the more real for both of us. \n\nBefore the MC, we kept the jade plant on our screened-in porch on the table. It's still there, and I look at it whenever we have drinks or eat dinner out there.\n\nIt's Monday, and this only happened on Friday, so this is all still so raw for me. I want so bad to be a mother, and I am so ready to start a family with my husband. He has promised me that we would try again as soon as we are ready - which I hope is the cycle after my next period. \n\nI don't know if anyone else feels this way, but the thing that is tearing me inside is the complete distrust of my own body. How can I get pregnant again? How can I carry another baby and not miscarry? I can't imagine ever bringing a healthy baby to term. I feel as though this experience has ruined my otherwise joyful expectations of pregnancy. And on top of all this, I don't want to fucking wait for this bleeding to be over, then my next period, then my fertile window, and then another fucking 40 weeks to have the baby *IF* I get pregnant right away. I already put 9 weeks and 5 days in the bag! How can that be for nothing?! \n\nNow I find myself desperately searching for older women who have one child or women who have had miscarriages who now have children. I want to hear all about the 2nd pregnancy that's successful and the many children that follow a miscarriage. I'm just so worried and so negative.\n\nSo that is where I'm at now.

Some very obvious. Only seems dark with Frer. Others are faint but there. Still getting negatives on digitals so I do assume this is my left over HCG toying with me. \nI got blood work done Friday and I'm awaiting my results, then I'll go for a repeat. \nI also have an ultrasound tomorrow. \n\nIs lingering HCG normal?

It's been a little less than a week since my MC - I was a first-timer and it hit me pretty hard. Here's my story for reference:\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/ttcafterloss/comments/3fomfy/my_story_trigger_warning_miscarriage_at_9w5d/\n\nI went in today for my follow-up and I had A LOT of questions to ask and I thought I'd post them, along with the answers, for anyone else who would like to know:\n\nQ: I'm LIGHTLY spotting with tiny clots and I passed the fetus on 7/31 and probably the placenta on 8/1. Am I done?\n\nA: Yes - you might spot for another week or so, but women only continue to bleed and bleed if their bodies are having difficulty passing everything. Since you already passed everything, you're body is almost done.\n\nQ: I know I should not have unprotected sex right now (in case of a pregnancy in this time period), but when can my husband and I resume sex?\n\nA: After bleeding has stopped. You can start to use tampons, but you should wait another week (2 weeks from start of MC).\n\nQ: Is it *smart* to try again after the first regular period? Should I wait for two periods?\n\nA: There is no reason not to start trying after the first period after the MC. You want to just get a regular lining in there and then have all of that lining removed before you try again.\n\nQ: When can I expect to get my period?\n\nA: Anywhere from 2 - 7 weeks from now.\n\nQ: I bled red on 7/30 and 7/31. Then it's been mostly clots and spotting - I've never filled a pad. Should I be worried about a thin uterine lining? Is this what could have caused the MC? My period is usually heavy flow for 2 days and then light spotting for one or more days. Is this too thin?\n\nA: No, the way you described your MC sounds very normal. There is no reason to believe that your lining is too thin. Again, women bleed a lot when their body isn't passing. You've already passed everything. \n\nQ: Is my hypothyroid condition to blame? Last time I tested I was at 1.8 (very good range) - I am very sensitive to my levels (all energy is drained if I'm at or above 3.5). Since the MC my pregnancy fatigue is gone and I feel back to normal (seemingly no thyroid issues). Even though I'm treating my thyroid, could this have caused something? I also have a retroverted uterus, could that have caused an issue? \n\nA: No - we'll check your levels again (since it's a good time to get them re-checked), but that would not be a reason to MC. Same with the uterus - that did not cause additional problems.\n\nQ: I noticed a pattern in my cycle since I've been tracking since September of '14. Every-other month it is 29 days and the other months have ranged between 31 and 42. Am I not ovulating during the longer months? I conceived in what would have been a 29-day cycle...\n\nA: You probably just ovulate at different times each month. Too much data can be a curse...\n\nQ: How many 6-8 MC do you see? \n\nA: This is very common - probably 15 out of 100. Yours sounds very normal and common.\n\nQ: I have an ovulation thermometer at home...and I've been using it in the morning just to get into the habit. I have varying waking schedules. Does it matter what time I take my temperature upon waking?\n\nA: No - it shouldn't make much of a difference WHEN you take it, just as long as you take it upon waking and while you're still lying down.\n\nQ: I have a relatively low blood pressure, any cause for concern? Range of 100-110 / 58-70\n\nA: No, that is a low-to healthy range.\n\nQ: Am I now considered high risk since having a MC?\n\nA: No\n\nQ: Am I at a higher risk of having another MC?\n\nA: No\n\nQ: Since I had a MC due probably to \"chromosomal abnormalities\" can you tell me what kind we're talking about? Do I have a very high chance of being a carrier of Downs Syndrome? AKA, do one of us have a translocation? \n\nA: It's impossible to say what type of issue there was with the fetus. Translocation is very rare - if you continue to have MC, we can test for this, but for some reason, those egg and sperm did not function properly. It could be any number of things, not just Downs.\n\n\n\n\n\nOk people, those were all my questions. I pretty much expected a lot of those answers, but I just wanted to ask them to a doctor. Side note: fuck that office. They made me wait 15 minutes past my appointment (pregnant bellies and then a damn *newborn* in the waiting room), then they made me wait ANOTHER 20 minutes in the waiting room, right next to the ultrasound room where someone got to hear a heartbeat and there were jokes and laughs and overall sensations of joy. Plus, it was my 3rd time there with my 3rd doctor.

My husband and I have been excited to start a family for quite some time. Last year, we started trying and got very lucky - pregnant by our second ovulation. My pregnancy was progressing normally. No gestational diabetes, no pre-eclampsia, no hypertension. After a completely normal 37 week checkup the day before, I noticed a lack of movement and went to the hospital to get checked out. The worst was confirmed. No heartbeat. That moment was the worst moment of my life. Pure anguish rose up inside me as I began to face this new reality without my son Henry. We had been saying \"okay Henry - any time now!\" If only I had a crystal ball and could see in the future. Because I didn't know anything was wrong. We discovered through autopsy that the placenta was small and he died of hypoxia. I was induced and delivered my son vaginally, held him skin to skin for quite some time, took photos with him and whispered over and over in his beautiful perfect ear \"I'm so sorry baby. I didn't know. I love you so much. I love you forever.\" My husband and I had several hours with him before we gave him to the nurse and left the hospital. Leaving the hospital without him, I felt stunned and numb. We have been grieving and mourning our loss since then. It hasn't even been two months. We miss him terribly, but somehow we have found a way to go on and even find joy and laughter. I feel lucky, in a way, that I do not believe in God or fate - I would be a lot angrier if I did. My son didn't make it, but it's not because I was meant to be stronger or he was meant to be an angel...not as far as I'm concerned. He is in our hearts forever. When I get caught by the natural beauty of the world, I think of him and feel close to him. I love him fiercely and consider it my duty as his momma to protect his legacy and memory. I have incredible support around me. My husband is the best, my family and friends have been amazing, and my work has been incredibly accommodating. But we want another baby. We are ready...more than ready. I'm 36 and we hope to have two living children. I will mourn my loss for the rest of my life. We have started trying again. It gives us hope and something real to look forward to. I know there are no guarantees in life, but it's important to hold on to hope and try your best to build a future that brings you joy. I sincerely think we moms who have experienced loss have an added capacity for love, gratitude, and compassion. I would never have chosen to join this club, but I'm glad we are not alone and I'm proud of all of you.

She was my first pregnancy, and it took 2 years of trying to conceive her.  I became pregnant shortly after my husband landed an amazing job.  Everything was looking up for us, and after she was born we were seriously the happiest we'd ever been.  \n   When she was 6 month old, my husband was diagnosed with cancer.  It's slow growing, and he had major surgery to remove a lot of it, but he is stage 4 and thus incurable.  We agreed almost immediately after his diagnosis that we still wanted another child.  My husband has years left, and we decided to start trying as soon as he recovered from surgery.\n   He was just starting to feel like himself, when I ruptured a disc in my back.  The pain was debilitating, and I was out of work for 3 months while jumping through insurance hoops to get surgery.  Needless to say, this put off our plans of another baby.  I finally had surgery in December, but we waited another 6 months to ensure that I was definitely healed.  The waiting was so frustrating, because time is our enemy.  We never know when my husband will have an appointment that will change our lives.\n  We started trying in June.  Since it took so long to get pregnant with my daughter, I didn't have high expectations for a quick conception.  I was hoping to be pregnant by next summer.  I got pregnant the first month we tried.  It was so amazing.  It was like finally, finally, something both good and easy was happening for us.  We were beyond thrilled.  I made plans to announce at my daughter's birthday party, and built the theme around the announcement.\n   We had my first prenatal appointment a week and a half ago at 9w 0d.  The baby was measuring 7w 5d, and had no heartbeat.  I'd had zero warning, no spotting, no unusual cramping, nothing.  It was such a kick in the teeth.  Haven't we been through enough?  Are we not allowed to have something good happen?  My husband in particular was devastated.  I decided immediately on a D&amp;C.  I couldn't handle the thought of seeing it, or experiencing it.  My doctor is amazing, she does it under general, and held my hand until I fell asleep.\n  So today was the party.  The party that I was supposed to announce at.  It was a good day.  I was afraid I'd be sad, but I wasn't.  The only thing that bothered me all day, were the actions of someone I thought was a good friend.  She knew I was pregnant.  Knew I initially meant to announce at the party.  Knew the plan.  Knew I miscarried.  She is also pregnant, due a week before my due date.  A few days before that awful appointment, she announced her pregnancy on FB, with a picture of her daughter in a \"Big Sister\" t shirt.  Guess what her daughter wore to my daughter's party today?  Literally, the only event that I'd ever have a problem with it.  My other good friend noticed immediately, and reminded me that pregnant friend has always been a bit self involved, and likely didn't think of me when doing it.  She'd probably feel like shit if anyone pointed it out to her, but it still pisses me off.  Of all the fucking days to dress your kid in that shirt?  \n   Anyway, I'm trying to stay positive.  I tell myself that if we got pregnant so easily this time, it can happen again.  That this baby would have likely been messed up in some capacity, and I need a sick kid like I need a hole in the head.  I've worked in patient care at a Children's Hospital for years, and I see kids with chromosomal abnormalities all the time.  My body didn't betray me, it did what it was supposed to do, mostly.  I'm still going to have a baby, it just won't be in March.   I just want to fast forward through this part.  I want to get my period so we can start trying again.  I want to be pregnant again, with a baby that I'll get to love and snuggle and nurse.  This part, the hurry up and wait.  This is the fucking worst.\n  ", "stickied": false, "subreddit": "ttcafterloss", "subreddit_id": "t5_34scd", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Background, story, a bit of a rant", "url": "http://www.reddit.com/r/ttcafterloss/comments/3gf48e/background_story_a_bit_of_a_rant/"}, {"author": "AutoModerator", "author_created_utc": 1325741068, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_text": null, "author_fullname": "t2_6l4z3", "created_utc": 1439190130, "distinguished": "moderator", "domain": "self.ttcafterloss", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/ttcafterloss/comments/3gfsut/ttcafterloss_ttc_daily_discussion_thread_august/", "gilded": 0, "id": "3gfsut", "is_self": true, "link_flair_css_class": "ttc", "link_flair_text": "TTC Thread", "media_embed": {}, "num_comments": 129, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/ttcafterloss/comments/3gfsut/ttcafterloss_ttc_daily_discussion_thread_august/", "retrieved_on": 1440557938, "score": 10, "secure_media_embed": {}, "selftext": "**This thread is for members who are TTC or waiting to try.

Additionally, I felt this way before experiencing my MC - and I'm thankfully \"past\" the very emotional, raw aspect of the MC. \n\nMy friend is a Spanish guy from Barcelona who now works in MN with his American wife and their two boys under the age of 4. He is a Chemistry professor and his wife is a Comparative Literature professor...both very smart, very kind people.\n\nHowever, it seems as though every time he posts on Facebook it is to complain about being a parent. Today just really pissed me off. Today his status message is: \"Finally, it's Monday morning. Parents of small (and hectic) children, we survived another weekend! \u202a#\u200eFreeAtLast\u202c\"\n\nI just HATE when parents joke about disliking their children. I have another friend who is constantly joking (in person and online) about wanting to give her children away to *anyone* who will have them. Sometimes I just want to get up in their face about it - I mean, I know you're joking, but you sound TERRIBLE. Let's see if you joke about this if your child was actually kidnapped, or if you had to have a conversation with someone whose child was going through cancer or had a horrible accident. It's just gross. I have a dark sense of humor, but joking about not liking your kids just rubs me the wrong way.\n\nSo yeah, I'm not going to say anything to my friend on Facebook, but I really feel like making him think again about that kind of mentality. If I had no filter and wanted to \"use my miscarriage\" to make him feel bad, I'd say:\n\nAs someone who just suffered a miscarriage - I would like to say that I find your attitudes towards your children not only hurtful to them, but hurtful to all the people who want children but sadly cannot or are having difficulty conceiving. You're a smart man, and I'm sure your children are smart as well - would you like your four-year-old to know that you suffer through your weekends with him? Would you like him to know that you cannot wait to send him to daycare so that you can pay someone to care for your child? Not everyone thinks your harried posts about being a father are cute. I long to be a mother and I will NEVER publicly joke about not wanting my children.\n\nUgh. Ok, that's my rant. I'm not sure if this is the correct place to post this, so please let me know if it is and I will delete it.

I was on Zoloft when I had a missed miscarriage in April and recently weaned myself off of it for various reasons (gained 30 pounds, felt like my emotions were blunted, worried that it caused my miscarriage, etc.). Unfortunately my depression and anxiety have returned full-force. I started seeing a therapist and am getting a psych evaluation later this month, but I was really curious what other moms-to-be chose to do in a similar situation, especially after experiencing a loss. Part of me feels like I should not be taking any medication if I can help it, but my anxiety is getting the best of me and making it difficult to look for jobs right now. I had a phone interview this morning and was sick to my stomach with anxiety over it :( We also recently started trying to conceive again and as you all know, it\u2019s a really stressful process (it took us 8 months to get pregnant before), and I can\u2019t even fathom having another loss. Have any of you had success with medications other than Zoloft while they are pregnant and/or TTC? Or were you able to do it medication-free? Any experiences or thoughts are more than welcome.

A post from my phone, apologies in advance for formating etc.\n\nWe are TTC #1 and got pg on the first try in Jan of this year. Sadly I had an early mc in March. Since then nothing, despite temping, timing, and preseed.\n\nWe have been married for a year, so everyone is on 'babywatch'. I told my family about our loss about a month later, so that they would appreciate we were 'trying' and back off. Hubs didn't want to tell anyone and basically said that he was disregarding the pregnancy entirely since it was an early loss. So as if it never happened. I've felt a bit abandoned in that regard, but I had friends to talk to and that was ok. Everyone deals in their own way. \n\nWe are currently on holidays and staying with his side of the family. They are kind and mean well, if a bit loud and boisterous (and kinda redneck I guess). They have no idea that we are TTC or about the loss. So in an attempt to be cute/funny, they literally met me at the door with a pregnancy journal and tons of good-natured but pushy ribbing about wanting a grand baby. Which was pretty painful for me but I just smiled and nodded because there were some people there that I didn't know well and I didn't want to bring it all up right then. \n\nIn an effort to deflect some of the heat off me and onto their son, and in a tiny indirect cry for help, I tried to pull DH into the banter, but he refused to engage and walked away. Which I guess I could have done but it felt rude and I thought I could manage until we got some private time to talk to my MIL. Which didn't happen last night. \n\nSo today I made a comment to DH, when we were alone, that I wished his family would back off and get out of my uterus. Then he basically blamed me for enabling the conversation with them because I didn't shut them down immediately or change the subject. Though I tried to but they are a collective conversational freight train. Never mind the whole (ha ha) preggo book. \n\nThen I got mad at him for abandoning me with his own family when, IMO, he should be taking point to handle inappropriate jokes, as I would with mine.  \n\nAnyway we squabbled and he got mad at me being mad, and ditched me to go on a long walk.

I thought using OPKs would make ttc a little easier but now I'm more confused than ever. I bought 40 strips so I'm planning on continuing to test daily (still hoping to get a positive), but for now I think I'll go back to testing once a day, unless my CM changes.
