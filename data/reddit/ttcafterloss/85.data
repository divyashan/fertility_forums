My doctor was willing to work with me on coding the testing she ordered as \"DXL\" or \"diagnostics\"  as opposed to infertility. I told her it had been an expensive year already due to the miscarriage and she immediately knew what I was asking for. Then she told me if cost was a concern and to avoid my copay, we could go over test results via email instead of coming back into the office. Bless her. It's not the copay I'm worried about, but the scare of having to pay thousands of dollars out of pocket for testing.   \n\n\nWhen I called the insurance company to get an understanding of the costs of the tests (typical infertility panel: FSH, AMH, thyroid, prolactin, etc.), the rep on the phone immediately asked me if it was for infertility purposes. My doctor told me to tell her it was for \"history of miscarriage.\" The rep called my doctor, and confirmed that the testing was coded as \"diagnostics.\" I definitely got the impression that the rep knew we were skirting the system, and she didn't sound pleased. Too bad, lady; get in line, none of us are pleased.   \n\n\nThe good news is that I went in for my CD3 tests this morning after getting an estimate for the cost, just to make sure there wouldn't be any surprises. I was able to do this online for \\*most\\* of the tests, but couldn't find the right codes for AMH, prolactin, or progesterone. However, the other tests will come out to about $5 out of pocket each. Without insurance, each test would have been between $20-25 each. It's not he obscene costs I've seen elsewhere, but still a good chunk of money when it's all said and done, especially after all of the unforeseen medical costs from this year related to our miscarriage.   \n\n\nI researched the Modern Fertility route, but I was a little late on potentially ordering it, and it didn't cover everything my doctor wanted to test, so I didn't pursue it.   \n\n\nNext up: reviewing results and testing my progesterone on CD21.   \n\n\nGood luck to anyone else that's trying to get testing done in a more affordable way!", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "steward_reports": [], "stickied": false, "subreddit": "ttcafterloss", "subreddit_id": "t5_34scd", "subreddit_subscribers": 6314, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Update to insurance coding for hormone testing", "total_awards_received": 0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/ttcafterloss/comments/dt13u9/update_to_insurance_coding_for_hormone_testing/"}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "AutoModerator", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_6l4z3", "author_patreon_flair": false, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1573149957, "domain": "self.ttcafterloss", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/ttcafterloss/comments/dt1jcv/ttcafterloss_daily_discussion_thread_2_november/", "gildings": {}, "id": "dt1jcv", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 12, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/ttcafterloss/comments/dt1jcv/ttcafterloss_daily_discussion_thread_2_november/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1573149958, "score": 1, "selftext": "**How are you doing today?

My best friend knew how excited I was, so suggested going for an early scan. I decided to go alone as I wanted to surprise as I wanted the scan photo home as a Christmas Surprise for my partner. To cut a long story short, I had suffered a MMC.\nBefore it happened to me, I did\u2019nt  even know this was a thing, let alone heard of it before. I made it to my car after reassuring the nurses I would now speak to my midwife and just feeling inconsolable, the pain that ripped through me was on another level, the loss I felt for myself and my partner was devastating. \nAs this was over Christmas and no one knew, we carried on as normal and pretended that I had a \u201ctummy upset\u201d when I had to go in and have a D&amp;C on the 27th of December. I became extremely depressed and had therapy, which helped enormously in our decision to keep trying again.\n\n6 months on, we had had no success, so mindful that I\u2019m in my 30s and it took us years to conceive in the first place I decided to speak to my GP, who referred us to the fertility clinic. My partner was tested, he\u2019s fine, I had a Hycosy (this was fine) and blood tests, which suggested that I was not ovulating properly, so was prescribed Clomid (this was 10 days ago).\n\nLast week, I decided to do a HPK as I has been feeling more tired and ratty than usual, and got a positive, I was ecstatic. I tested again the next day with a better digital test and got a negative. Praying that I was wrong I then tested again the day after with a basic test again, and the positive was much more faint than on the first, then 15 minutes later AF started. I was fine at first, shrugged it off, as we had a new course of action anyway, no problem. 2 days later, I\u2019m devastated all over again, and I\u2019m not sure I can do this anymore. \n\nThing is, a decision needs to be made by me today. This is the day I\u2019m supposed to start taking the Clomid. my partner reminded me to take it as he walked out the door this morning, he wants us to move on.\n\nThere\u2019s no real point to this post, I just needed to finally tell someone all of it.

We got our bfp first cycle, we were ecstatic. Planning how we were going to tell people. Already had told my mom. Then I miscarried. Well frick, okay about 1 in 5 end in a miscarriage so we'll just move on. The next cycle nothing. 3rd cycle another bfp. Now we're still excited but more reserved. Still tell my mom the second I saw that 2nd line. We get to 7 weeks, and dare to start talking about how we want to tell people. A couple days later, another miscarriage. Now I'm an absolute wreck. Seriously depressed and barely functional for a while. So, on to the vent. Dh has 3 pregnant cousins. If I hadn't had the first miscarriage, I'd be the 2nd farthest along. I'm genuinely excited for 2 of them and I enjoy spending time with them, the majority of the time. However, the 3rd already had her 1st child taken. She came heavily pregnant to a family gathering drunk and high as a kite. So, why the actual frick does she get to keep her kid? Before ttc I had a 10% weight loss. Had a preconception checkup. Started taking everything that was recommended. Start semi-regular exercise. Literally everything I was told to do. Yet somehow I've lost 2. I've put in the work but somehow she gets to keep hers. I feel the need to say, I absolutely don't want anything to happen to this kid or anything like that. It's just so incredibly frustrating to see her openly not give a flying frick about her child, while I'm going crazy because I'm in love with a child that doesn't yet exist.

Thanks to anyone who reads through. On mobile.\n\n\nI\u2019m looking for a new TTC community and I\u2019m not sure if this is the place. Seems like a fit but let me know if you think I\u2019d be better off somewhere else.\n\nMy TTC journey started two years ago now. I have bipolar 1 disorder and after a med change I became hypomanic. Suddenly life was full of pregnancy possibilities. I also have PCOS and was at the time 31 almost 32. After a year of trying to go unmedicated and losing my stability and sanity in trying we decided to throw in the towel. October of last year I had my last period. In December I started noticing small things about myself changing. I kept convincing myself I was just overly sensitive because I had been looking for signs for a year. Told myself I was crazy for thinking that I could be pregnant having stopped all fertility treatments. Lied to myself about why food suddenly tasted so weird. Finally I took a pregnancy test on December 22nd. It was positive. I was beyond elated and so scared. I had not been taking care of myself or taking vitamins and there I was, possibly two months or so pregnant. I went to the dr at the end of December. They did a pregnancy test. While we waited on that they went ahead and did an ultrasound. Nothing was there. I held it together thinking \u2018okay, maybe this is normal if I\u2019m really early in the pregnancy...\u2019 then they took me back to the room and said the pregnancy test took the full three mins and that it was a super faint line. Now I was to have a blood test. After the blood test I was told I was not pregnant. My world shattered.\n\nFast forward through months of depression and instability and suicide watch (thanks bipolar for making it even more difficult to handle...) I am now the most mentally stable I have been in my whole life. My husband has finally recovered and is also the most mentally stable he\u2019s been in his whole life. Thing is, immediately following the chemical pregnancy my husband said he never wanted to try again. He was done. No arguments. I put in an iud and moved on. Also in this time, both my sis in laws got pregnant and delivered two beautiful baby boys, and my sister is awaiting the arrival of her fourth child (also a boy). Even though I am coping really well it\u2019s still really hard to be involved in all the baby stuff.\n\nNow for the tricky part.... my husband is suddenly second guessing his decision. He keeps bringing up how much he loves seeing his sisters with there babies and how he\u2019s jealous. How he\u2019s worried he\u2019ll regret us not having a child. I shut him down basically every time. His response? \u201cDo you think that maybe I\u2019m just finally in a better place?\u201d So now I have hope... now my desire is back... now I again am ready to try and try and try. I can\u2019t be sure he is though. He claimed before he was ready and though I haven\u2019t fully explained let me just say in short he lied to make me happy.\n\nSo now here I sit. Wondering if we ever will try again. Wondering if I may ever get the baby I want so badly. Wondering if now that I\u2019m on lithium for bipolar if it\u2019s even remotely worth the risks.\n\nThe ball is in his court so to speak and all I can do is sit here and hope.

Being 5 DPO right now I'm past the pressure of the sex week (\"gotta get it exactly right!\") but also can't test yet. So I'm in a relative sea of calm right now.\n\nI am grateful for:\n\n- This awesome community of people from all over the world who get it, who understand, and who jump in to help with kind comments.\n- Family and friends. Everyone is alive and well. It's a good time right now.\n- My relationship. There's no doubt that TTC has brought up some deep wounds. But my husband is working with me and he's kind. We are nurturing good vibes and building up our bank of positivity in the marriage. I know it will be so important for the challenges ahead.\n- My dog. He's my first (fur) baby. He brings us a lot of joy.\n- Where we live (Toronto, Canada). Making ends meet isn't always easy and we are working hard to set ourselves up for the future. But we have public healthcare, we are safe, and even though it's gearing up to get damn cold again, we are warm and cozy in the little life we've built.

I went on a little holiday 2 weeks later and I hated every fucking moment of it, I didn\u2019t realise at the time but I was in a deeeep deep dark depression, I was not me in any way shape or form. I was having sex with the same 2 guys almost every week and it was like a rampage lmao, and I was doing it almost for relief and to forget that I don\u2019t have my child anymore. My child\u2019s father was completely unsupportive and would stress me out multiple times a day and would check in to see if I changed my mind or lost our child.\n\nbut anyway, I realised, a few weeks after I\u2019d have sex with these guys Id google early pregnancy symptoms. Almost every month since my loss, I\u2019ve checked for the symptoms and for some reason expecting it all to be different but it never is. I make myself believe I might be pregnant and it hurts when i\u2019m not.

I\u2019m just looking to see if anyone can relate because I almost feel guilty for doing this. I have a job but i\u2019m not financially stable. My brother got his girlfriend pregnant purposely a month after I lost my child, and I don\u2019t think it was to spite me, but as soon as I announced my pregnancy, I realised she was trying to conceive. at 16.

Each month, I get a little bit of hope again, and then it's dashed. This month was the best IUI we've done. I had two amazing, beautiful follicles, and my husband's sperm looks fantastic.

I was feeling defeated.\n\nso I asked about a referral to a fertility specialist. She said no referral was needed and I could make an appt that would be available in let February BUT it isn\u2019t covered at all under my insurance. \n\nSo I cancelled everything. I have no idea what to even ask for at this point.  They basically told me I was fucked unless I wait for October to change my insurance to cover fertility. \n\nPlease offer an advice you have.

We worked out it had passed around the time my doctor called to tell me it was a viable pregnancy, and that we were free to tell people if we wanted to. Luckily I was uncomfortable telling people so soon, and we agreed on telling family and a couple of close friends, but it was so hard having to break the news. I had been referred to the antenatal clinic, and all afternoon had to take calls saying I no longer needed the appointment for midwife/classes/etc, because I no longer had a baby. One part of me wanted to dodge them, another part wanted to get it over with so next week I wouldn't have to deal with it.\n\nIn my logical brain I know it was just a bean, but I loved it the moment I found out (3 weeks), and it's been about 24 hours but I can't stop crying. All I want to do is wake up from what seems like a bad dream. They told me there was nothing I could've done better, that I'm perfectly healthy, it just wasn't the right time. But for some reason it's just easier to blame myself than say I had no control. My partner and I are both so heartbroken, and I am not sure where to go from here. Time heals all wounds, whatever will be will be, I've heard this a thousand times in the past 24 hours and I can't seem to give a shit, because it seems so unfair. We were already so in love with our little bean.\n\nHow do we move forward? He is trying so hard to be strong for me, but he breaks down whenever I break down. I just feel like I don't care about anything anymore, and that's not me. I go to counselling but I can't get an appointment until next month (I've asked to be called if there are any cancellations), I am so lost and heartbroken. I am so angry, but it's not directed at anyone or anything. I don't know where to go from here. This is our third miscarriage, the third time I've been told \"It just happens, there's nothing wrong with you\". If there's nothing wrong, why is it so hard? We weren't ready the first two times, and while it was sad it was easier to accept it wasn't our time - this time we hadn't been more excited.

I just got my period after a 25 day cycle with only a 10 day luteal phase. I confirmed ovulation at day 15 via temps, although I had EWCM for a day or two after that. I had a big temp spike 8 and 9 dpo, which made me get excited, but it dropped back down yesterday (still above the coverline). \n\nMy last cycle was messed up, too. I wasn't temping yet, but I probably ovulated around day 16. Then, starting at 8DPO, I started spotting and I spotted every day until my period, with a 28 day cycle. I chalked it up to stress because around that time was the due date.\n\nI never in the past had short cycles like this one, or a week of spotting.

It has been one hell of a few days and I am only just coming round to accepting it all. I really hope it is okay for me to post here, as it is somewhat of an ongoing thing. I am happy to delete if not.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy partner and I discovered we were pregnant on the 31st of October, after trying for just two months. Very surprising, as after having months of regular ovulation, I had some problems with the digital test where I got seven days of flashing faces (high fertility) well past my ovulation date, but no actual static smiley (showing peak). I mention this because I'm not sure if it means anything, or perhaps caused an issue.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAt around 5wks 3 days, I saw a tiny amount of pink discharge when I wiped. Absolutely no negative symptoms or pain at all. Almost impossible to see. I panicked, went to my GP who made a referral to the Early Pregnancy Unit. They measured my hCG, which came back at 20000 at just 5wks and 4 days. No concerns, they booked me in for an early scan three days later.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAt the scan, the sonographer said he could see an empty sac, measuring 14mm, no yolk or fetal pole, and a very large mass on my right ovary/Fallopian tube. He said this was either an ectopic pregnancy, a blighted ovum or I had miscalculated my dates. They took my bloods again which came back as over 32000 (60 hours after my first blood test, so not doubled). I spoke to two consultants, both of which were positive I was having an ectopic and rushed me in for emergency surgery. They couldn't understand how I was so well, absolutely no pain or discomfort, when this mass was so large. The hCG levels threw them off as well, but they said with 90% confidence that it was ectopic and I should prepare to lose one of my tubes.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI woke up from the surgery to be told there was nothing. No ectopic, my tubes looked perfect, there was no mass. They could only assume the sonographer made a mistake, or whatever he did see had disappeared by the time I went in for surgery.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm back home now, recovering from a laparoscopy, in a lot of pain and just massively confused. Grateful that it wasn't an ectopic but really confused. It went from the sonographer saying it might be something incredibly serious OR it might just be a bit early to see anything, to the consultants writing on my discharge notes that it was a \"anembryonic pregnancy\" once they had found it wasn't an ectopic. Although they alluded to this throughout, I also had consultants telling me that they wouldn't touch my womb during the operation, in case it was a viable pregnancy. The last consultant I saw just said this was very unlikely and I should prepare myself for the worst.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI still have all of my symptoms. I have accepted this is not a viable pregnancy, but none of what is happening makes any sense. Incredibly high hGC for my dates, continuing to increase, no bleeding, no cramps, but nothing on the scan apart from a sac, then to an ectopic, then to everything is great in there but it just didn't work out.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI have been asked to return for a blood test tomorrow to measure my hCG, so they can decide whether I'll miscarry naturally or whether I will need to take medication.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI don't even know what I'm looking for here. I just wanted to get my thoughts down and ask if any of this experience was remotely normal?

Wondering if anyone else has experienced anything similar to what\u2019s happening to me right now, and how you\u2019ve handled.\n\nMy second period arrived about 10 days earlier than expected yesterday and the amount of blood was alarming. I\u2019ve never had this happen before, but it was like a sudden avalanche of blood with large clots all at once. It soaked entirely through my pants, covering all of the fabric from waist to knees. It was so much blood that it triggered a brief ptsd-like panic that reminded me of when I began miscarrying naturally before the D&amp;E.\n\nI felt weak and lightheaded, so I took an iron tablet and ibuprofen, drank water and rested, and today it is still quite heavy but no clots. I am nauseous and achy.\n\nI had a particularly stressful weekend, so I\u2019m not sure if this is what has triggered the early heavy 2nd cycle, or if this might be related to the D&amp;E I had in September after my 8wk MMC. \n\nThanks in advance if any of you has insight. I\u2019ve messaged my doctor and am waiting for her response, but wanted to touch base with you all to see if you have any similar experiences and how you handled it.", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "steward_reports": [], "stickied": false, "subreddit": "ttcafterloss", "subreddit_id": "t5_34scd", "subreddit_subscribers": 6381, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Alarmingly heavy period, 2nd cycle post MMC", "total_awards_received": 0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/ttcafterloss/comments/dy5e7q/alarmingly_heavy_period_2nd_cycle_post_mmc/"}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "AutoModerator", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_6l4z3", "author_patreon_flair": false, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1574100400, "domain": "self.ttcafterloss", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/ttcafterloss/comments/dy6txb/ttcafterloss_daily_discussion_thread_2_november/", "gildings": {}, "id": "dy6txb", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 23, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/ttcafterloss/comments/dy6txb/ttcafterloss_daily_discussion_thread_2_november/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1574100401, "score": 1, "selftext": "**How are you doing today?

I\u2019m 23 years old, engaged my to angel baby\u2019s father. We are getting married in October 2020 but I want to go ahead and start trying again after I get my pre pregnancy TAC. I was talking to some girls at work about us trying again soon and how excited I was. This older woman that sits next to me starts making comments about how young I am and how if she were me then she would wait at least 5 or 6 more years before I worried about that. I politely told her I knew I was young but we had recently lost our son in June and honestly I just didn\u2019t want to wait. I\u2019m ready to be a mom. She looks at me dead serious and says \u201cMaybe that\u2019s Gods way of saying you weren\u2019t ready to be a mom\u201d It took everything in me to not go off. How dare you play off the death of my child as me being young. I was fully prepared to be a mom and very excited to have my son. It kills me how some people can be so ignorant and just flat out rude for no reason. I still have to sit next to her everyday but I ignore her as much as I possibly can. I\u2019m not willing to lose my job over her but I\u2019d really like to give her a piece of my mind and tell her exactly what type of person I think she is.
