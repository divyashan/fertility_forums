It was hard for me to find first-hand information about the MVA, and most information I did find was kind of fear-mongering from people who had gone through a D&amp;C under anesthesia and couldn't comprehend that anyone would do this while awake. I wrote up a [post!](https://www.reddit.com/r/Miscarriage/comments/3doxn4/my_mmc_and_experience_with_mva_an_inoffice/) after my first MVA that seemed to help provide some info to others going through it. It was great to have a procedure that didn't carry the risks of general anathema and sported a shorter recovery period to boot. \n\nAfter going through my second miscarriage back in October, I had another office MVA, but this time she did not remove everything. I had retained placenta which I passed 9 weeks after the MVA. This led to mild infection and after an MRI, my RE saw a band of scar tissue which would need to be removed. (AKA Asherman's, though a seemingly mild case). All this leads me to an in-office hysteroscopy.\n\nOffice Hysteroscopy: Again, I was kind of freaked out about doing this procedure while in an office setting, but I also was kind of relieved that I wouldn't have to be placed under general. I had the procedure yesterday and it was honestly kind of awesome. Here's the deal: Night before I inserted 2 tabs of misoprostol to start dilating my cervix. I also took 800mg ibuprofen and a Tylenol w/ codeine. This was the part I was most concerned with, as the contractions I went through passing the retained tissue were pretty horrific and I wasn't eager to go through similar pain. But thankfully, I had very minor cramps and slept mostly straight through the night. The next morning, I took a Valium and 2  Tylenol w/ codeine before heading to the doctor. Once there, they gave me a shot of another anti-inflammatory and another injection of something to prevent muscles from seizing (quite important in this area I imagine). \n\nMy husband sat with me and there were 2 nurses and the doctor (the head of microsurgery at my hospital). She injected lidocaine for the cervical block, which was the only painful part, but only minor. The block was awesome and I literally felt nothing throughout the rest of the procedure. (Side note: I process novocaine and other similar medications slowly so I always request that doctors give me an additional 5 minutes after injection. One doc told me she will starting this with other patients as it makes the dilation easier). \n\nThen she dilated my cervix and inserted the hysteroscope. There was a big monitor that we both could see. It was kind of awesome. She was in there to remove scar tissue, but surprise! there were polyps too! Within  few seconds she removed the polyps with the micro scissors, and kept searching for scar tissue, which she found and removed. She explained everything I was seeing (including the openings to my fallopian tubes, which were partially blocked by the polyps) and the whole thing was over in less than 10 minutes. It was pretty satisfying to see the polyps and scar tissue get removed and then see a clear uterine cavity afterwards, especially since the polyps could possibly have been causing the miscarriages.\n\nDepending on how much is removed, some people start estrogen therapy (to encourage lining regrowth) or a balloon inserted to prevent scar tissue from reforming. I have migraine with aura and cannot take estrogen because of that. My doctor said this was fine and that many studies show that there is no clinical difference in scar regrowth with balloon or estrogen vs. doing nothing. \n\nI will be using castor oil packs and continue yoga and acupuncture to increase blood flow, but fingers crossed there will be no scar regrowth. \n\nAfter the procedure, I felt a little sore and slow. I took 2 more Tylenol w/ codeine  that day, and have continued ibuprofen today. I have almost no pain, no cramping and feel pretty great. \n\nI hope this can help anyone out there who will be getting an in-office hysteroscopy! It is kind of cool to be awake for it, and your recovery time is slight. Just make sure they give you enough pain meds and you should be good.

I was having a TFMR of my baby girl with triploidy. I also haven't been very present over the my past week of loss limbo while waiting for my D&amp;E. I had my D&amp;E yesterday at the hospital where I work in labor and delivery. It was actually nice that I knew a lot of the staff including my anesthesiologists. Everyone was so supportive and kind. My regular OB came to check on me before the procedure and we cried together. The anesthesiologists gave me general anesthesia instead of IV sedation so that there would be no risk of me feeling/being aware of anything, since I told them I had been having nightmares and anxiety about this. I had also already had two doses of dilaudid because my cramps from the cytotec I premedicated with were incredibly painful, so they were worries that IV sedation wouldn't help as much. The last thing I remember was getting versed (the calm you and make you sleepy and forgetful medication) and the anesthesiologist turning off the brake on my bed. I don't even remember getting to the OR or anything thanks to the amnesia inducing versed. \n\nThe chaplain blessed our baby and the social worker set us up with a funeral home that will do the cremation for free. \n\nWe decided to name our baby girl Alma Lee ( Alma mean nurturing soul in Latin, Lee is the family middle name on my side) and we plan to plant a memorial tree at our new house and scatter her ashes with my grandpa's ashes when we plant the tree. My grandpa passed away in January and was beyond excited to finally have a great grandchild. My family agrees that it would be nice for them to be together. \n\nI cried on and off all day yesterday, but I think the pain meds are making it hard to really process the emotional pain right now too. \n\nI also wanted to thank everyone on this group. I received so much support and kind words when I introduced myself. I'm very glad I found this place and the \"Ending a Wanted Pregnancy\" support group (can't remember who suggested, but thank you so much). \n\nI really want to share a bit of my perspective as a labor and delivery nurse.

And they bring strength to people in ways you might not imagine; maybe it's by helping a nurse or care provider become better at supporting future patients through loss or by helping others (here) find strength while enduring their own loss. \nSending love to all of your babies. \ud83d\udc97\n\n(Sorry for the subpar pain med influenced grammar monstrosity above).

She also noticed some fluid around LO's heart. \n\nMy D&amp;C is scheduled for Monday at 11:00 am. I feel so sad and broken.

Over the last day they've meant more than I could have ever imagined. I felt so alone and now I feel surrounded by such love and compassion and it's overwhelming. I wound up having the D&amp;C this morning after starting to cramp overnight. Everybody was so amazing at the hospital and our doctor has the most beautiful spirit - I don't think we could've done that without her.

She spent 10 weeks in the NICU and it's been really rough, but we've been fortunate and she's now healthy. The day she turned 13 months old we found out I was pregnant. We had been trying and we were delighted.\n\nI was a little worried because I wasn't having much in the way of symptoms, but I had no real reason to be concerned. On February 19 at 7 weeks pregnant I had my first appointment and the ultrasound showed my uterus was empty though my HCG level was over 10,000. Several hours later, after many ultrasounds and very little information, it was confirmed that I had an ectopic pregnancy. My HCG levels were too high for the pill so I had to have laparoscopic surgery ASAP. Around midnight I had the surgery to remove the pregnancy and my left Fallopian tube. \n\nDuring the surgery, they checked and my doctor said my ovaries looked good and my one remaining tube \"looked beautiful\" but when they tried putting dye in it it wouldn't go through. They want to try getting dye through it again, but we have to wait 3 months. If that tube is also blocked most likely my only option will be IVF. That's 3 months of not knowing if I'll be able to get pregnant again (I'm not sure if we could afford IVF and there's not even a guarantee it would work).\n\nThis whole thing has been absolutely devastating. I lost my baby. And now I don't even know if I can have another. I've always wanted to have at least 3-4 kids. I've had one preemie, one ectopic pregnancy, and the future is so uncertain. I feel like the chances of that are slipping further and further away.\n\nMy cousin found out she was pregnant just before me and yesterday, exactly one month out from my loss, was the day she announced her forth was due two days after my due date. I know she didn't do it maliciously and I'm sure she didn't remember it was the one month mark from my loss, but of ALL the days she could have done it that was the worst.\n\nSorry for the long intro.

Wife and I have been trying to get a referral to MFM for 2 weeks now!! \n\nFirst, on Monday, the OB does an ultrasound after my wife's last m/c and everything looks great. We then ask for the referral to MFM since this is our second in a row and she tested positive for anticardiolipins and is a carrier for cohen's syndrome. OBthen says \"it's your choice which clinic you want to go to, but the one you suggested isn't affiliated with the hospital we deliver at\"\n\nus: \"ok great. that doesn't matter. this is the best MFM and perinatologists in our area so we want to go there.\"\n\nOB: \"Fine. i'll send the referral over today and they'll call you, but when it comes time to deliver, we won't have all your records since it'll be from a different hospital\"\n\nus: \"Ok we'll cross that bridge later\"\n\nFast forward to a thursday of that week, we call OB since we haven't heard from MFM yet, they say: \"Dr forgot to sign it and she's on call for delivery this week, so she won't be able to sign it until tomorrow. then we'll send it and they'll call you about a week later to schedule an appointment.\" Great, so because she forgot to do it on Monday we have to wait an extra week now basically.\n\nCall back the next day, Friday, OB says: \"Looks like the doctor signed it on wednesday, we'll send it out today.\" WTF?!?!?! you told me on thursday the doctor didn't sign it and now Friday you tell me she signed it on Wednesday? Why didn't you send it Wednesday? Come ON!!!\n\nNow the following Monday (yesterday), we still haven't heard from the specialist so I decide if we don't by the morning, I'll call again. Well we get a letter in the mail from the OB that has a referral ticket in it, and guess what, they referred us to the IVF clinic instead of the MFM. W-T-F!!!!\n\nSo I call them this morning and tell them they sent the referral to the incorrect clinic. They claim they did what the doctor instructed, so I ask them to look again at the doctors notes. The response: \"Hmm. it seems here she did write MFM. I'll contact our referral coordinator and have her contact you shortly.\" WHAT?!!? You were just ready to chalk this one up to \"we did what we were told\" and upon one iota of investigation you found out that you in fact didn't do at all what you were told?? Sheeeeeeeeeeeeeit. \n\nSo finally, they called us back and said they'd send the referral today to the correct clinic and we'd hear from this one in 72 hours. And to top it off, said that this referral does not even need the doctor's signature!!! So, if they had done it correctly last Monday, they could have sent the referral and we would have been contacted by Thursday of last week for an appointment. ARE YOU KIDDING ME WITH THIS WASTE OF TIME? AND THEY DIDN'T EVEN APOLOGIZE FOR THE ERROR!! We all know everyday counts when you are full of this uncertainty on top of how difficult we all know it is to get an appointment with a new provider. All while we're still mentally and emotionally drained from the last 6 months of m/c.

It sucks so hard that such a thing has to exist. But anyway. My husband and I have a 2.5 year old son.

We dreamed of our son finally becoming a great older brother, my husband would rub my belly and say, \"I can't wait to see your big pregnant belly again!\" I wasn't sure about the dating of the pregnancy, so I went in for a quant blood test, as that was the recommended starting point from the Dr's office. \n\nWhen the first results seemed low, they had me come back. When the increase in hcg wasn't high enough to their liking, I went in for an ultrasound. Everything looked, \"Perfect! Exactly what we want to see at this point,\" said the doctor. Phwew! Sweet relief. \n\nSo a week goes by, and I'm feeling tired, my boobs feel more sore, I feel pregnant. There's some light cramping here and there, but that felt normal also. Then, on Sunday, January 31, I had some bleeding. It was brown though, so I didn't want to worry that much, as I was aware implantation bleeding discharge could happen. I called Monday morning to make an appointment, and was able to schedule one for the next day. Tuesday morning, I go in for the appointment. The scheduler messed up and scheduled me for Wednesday. I threw a huge fit and demanded to be seen. My doctor, being the wonderful lady she is, made room to see me. The ultrasound showed the brightest little fluttering thing! \"There's your baby, and there's your heartbeat! Everything looks perfect!\" I was about 6weeks6days\n\nPhwew! Even more relief. I had a picture in hand, PROOF that I was pregnant. Elated, I told several friends, coworkers, family members, etc. the great news. Everyone was so excited for us, especially my son. He talked about how he was going to be a big brother and help mommy take care of the baby. \n\nThe following day, I go about preschool drop-off, work, lunch, more work as usual. I notice an increase in bleeding. This time it's red. I call the Dr's office again. I'm so tired of calling that number by this point. They tell me to come in the morning. I get an official ultrasound in the radiology building. The radiologist goes about the usual procedure, without saying a word. She's checking abdominally, and finally I asked, \"Is there a heartbeat?\" She says she can't see it, but sometimes it's easier to see through vaginal ultrasound. I can tell she's stalling. I saw a heartbeat abdominally just two days previous. Finally, she checks vaginally. Again, she's stalling. Lot's of moving the computer mouse, clicking the keyboard, typing in notes of what's on the screen. I ask to view what she's viewing. Finally I see it. My baby. No longer a bright flutter. My baby a flat grey color. I can't explain how there was such a difference just on ultrasound, but there was. She didn't have to confirm what I already knew. But I asked anyway once again. \"Is there a heart beat?\" She only shook her head no, then said she'd have the doctor follow up with me. And that was that. \n\nAfter that, I went to the doctors office (It's an OBGYN office, vs. the radiology building I was just in), and there was a new mom having a follow up, an expectant mother who just found out it was twins, and her mother beaming to everyone in ear shot what a proud grandma she was going to be. Torture. The secretary handed me some intake paperwork, that I guess I hadn't filled out when I had my first appointment there. I barely cried, \"Is this all necessary? Can't you see what I'm here for?\" I was shortly called in, and had it again confirmed. \n\nMy husband and I are trying again, of course (isn't that why we're all here?). I'm not optimistic at all, but feel I should hold out some hope. It all feels useless sometimes though.

I had morning sickness for a week or two, never puked, had only a few aversions, and by the second tri I felt pretty much normal. Last Tuesday night I noticed a decrease in movement but with it being so early on I figured the baby was sleeping or moving and I just wasn't feeling it. The next morning I started to freak out - I went to work but left at 10:30 when my husband came to get me. We went right to the doctors and they searched for a heart beat and couldn't find one with a doppler or portable US machine. They sent us to the hospital to confirm the loss and that's when we knew for sure we had lost the baby. We actually learned the sex that day too since we were waiting until the birth to find out. It was a girl and my husband and I were devastated. He had a feeling all along it was a girl and he wanted a little girl so badly, as did I. We had the name Emma Kate picked out for her and that's what we would call her from then on. We went home to make some calls and spend one more night at home and checked into the hospital on Thursday. They began induction with misoprostal. I think they gave me 400mgs? Not sure but it was a good amount, and they put it in my cervix. I had about 4 rounds, and by the last round it was early Friday morning and I had spiked a fever from the meds. It also gave me extreme GI issues. Once it wore off I made sure to not have any more of it and they put me on pitocin. Once that started up it wasn't long before Emma came out. Thinking about that moment makes my heart race - I yelled and cried, my husband cried, and there was just lots of combination. She was put on my chest right away but the placenta wouldn't budge so I was scared to hold her while they were trying tot get me to birth it. Finally the decided I needed a D&amp;C to get it out so they wheeled me away and left my husband with Emma. Once that was over and I was back, I was able to hold her for real. for about 6 hours we held her. We had our families come up and meet her and had the priest baptize her and bless us. We held her some more then it was time to say goodbye. We were told how much she would change from that night until the morning and we were scared to see her change. We gave one last goodbye and they took her away and we went to bed. It was hard to leave the hospital the next day, I hated leaving her there, leaving without a baby, going home to resume life. I wanted to stay there forever and not keep going further...I wanted time to stand still and still do. It's not fair that we have to go on and the days and months go on and Emma's not here. It will be one week tomorrow and soon it will be one month and 2 months...and so on. Her due date was June 25...we were going to have such a fun summer! \n\nWe miss our little girl, our little Emma Kate. My little BFF and daddy's girl. Life is unfair.

I no longer constantly obsessed about it and could sort of focus on other things in my life. CDs snuck up on me and I almost forgot to start OPKs. My thermometer proved it was actually a PoS so I switched back to my old one, and back to orally.\n\nI initially didn't want to try this cycle because we were stressed and didn't want a Christmas due date, but we both changed our minds. We agreed to do it as low key as possible though, so if we mess up we won't be distraught. \n\nThe 2 cycles I've tracked since my MC I ovulated late on CD 19 and 25. This cycle I drank raspberry leaf tea every morning. I'm fairly certain I just missed my LH peak so there was likely a +OPK in there I missed. That means I *should* ovulate tomorrow?? If so, it will be CD 18 so at least it isn't going longer! \n\nI've had almost no EWCM since my MC, so I researched briefly ways to increase it. Grapefruit juice came up, so I bought some. Yesterday I come home, pour a glass, take an OPK. On my drive home I was feeling like I wanted some action that night, and when I saw a very dark (but still negative) OPK, I knew it was on. \n\nI'm able to relax and enjoy sex more after 1-2 drinks, so I take my juice into the kitchen to spike it. First ice, but what comes out of the ice dispenser is actually something much bigger. A bottle had plopped into my juice; a flavored vodka sampler we'd had in the fridge since Thanksgiving. I find this hilarious and take pics to send to DH, must be a sign! I fish it out and find it's GRAPEFRUIT FLAVORED. OMG GOD IS SPEAKING TO ME. We did it that night, but I didn't tell DH it was because the OPK was almost positive, I didn't want him to feel pressured.\n\nFor months I've been plagued with a difficulty breathing that got worse when I laid down. It's triggered many a panic attack. I had a big on Sunday night after we went to bed. I was sobbing and flailing and thrashing when DH tried to get me to lay down. After the attack ended, I tried to go to sleep but I still couldn't breathe well.\n\nSuddenly I cough once, and feel mucous immediately slide down my throat. I sat up in bed for a bit and felt better enough to sleep.\n\nThe next day I felt great!! I could breathe so well! It was easy! I could take deep breaths with ease. I felt awesome, and it was during this awesome time I got my almost +opk and sign to drink. It felt like my body was getting it's act together finally.\n\nToday I feel like I'm struggling a little to get a deep breath again :( I'm wondering if I may have asthma??\n\nLast night my phone suddenly turned off and wouldn't boot up past the LG screen. Apparently this is a known issue for my phone, so I'll have to find my receipt somehow and send it back to LG. I'll be without it for 9-10 days, so I need to figure out what to do in the mean time. Work was soooo boring without my phone. And I can't make a doctor appointment without it.\n\nWe've been going back and forth for weeks about what to do about a vacation. We were thinking of going with my mom to her home country and had a fight about my MIL coming etc. But now we aren't going at all.

I needed to come to terms with everything because I felt almost numb to it all and thought I was fine and ready to move on immediately....well, that was the wrong approach.  I had to learn *how* to grieve. Now I'm feeling stronger.  I still have some tough moments (a friend and a cousin just announced their pregnancies last week, and this was truly difficult for me to digest because I'm genuinely really happy for them, but I  was alarmed when waves of anger/sadness/other weird emotions came out of nowhere.  It really helps when I remind myself that their pregnancies and the timing of them is completely NOT about me.  Remembering that snaps me out of my sad funk.)  All in all, I'd say my days are pretty pleasant and I'm feeling optimistic.  Thank God for books -- I've been reading everything I can find (off the topic of ttc, obviously) and it's really helped me heal and get out of my own head.  I've also been perfecting my green smoothie recipes :)  Highly recommend adding frozen mango!  Totally cuts down on the bitter greens taste.  Ok, *ANYWAY*, I'm VERY pleased to announce that AF is back &amp; I'm (almost) ready for action!  Doctor says we need to wait til May 1st to try again.  I'm so fricken proud of my body right now -- it's the weirdest feeling.  I want to go out and buy her a bouquet!  A green smoothie will have to do.  Need to load up on all the folic acid that was depleted after I got my Metho shot (followed by the emergency surgery; good grief.)  Anywho, had to share!!  This was more of a random shoutout to my bod, but any of you who have waited for their AF after an ectopic/MC/etc. probably understand.  Hope everyone has a lovely weekend.

What if we speak up? And what if it became a project we all worked on?\n\nWhy would we do this? Because it's not ok for us to fear going places and seeing people because someone you know is insensitive will be there. Because our feelings and thoughts and emotions of grief and sadness and despair are just as real as their happiness and overwhelmingly sickening positivity.\nSociety teaches us that being a minority means silence, disconnection and that you don't matter as much as other people. It also teaches us that bringing conversation down is a bad thing to do, that keeping the peace is more important than your own peace. It teaches us that to do otherwise is selfish. And isn't that how it feels some of time? \nWell I am sick of running to the nearest bathroom to cry, sick of taking makeup with me when I go out just in case, sick of sitting in silence while people forget or don't care or think it's ok to talk about baby-related life events. Our energy needs to be focused on ourselves and our partners, we need the energy that is so quickly used when we have to sit through this sort of thing, we need it to get better.\nSo I want to set a challenge for everyone here and hope it spreads.

I'm now 3 weeks post my D&amp;C and I'm still bleeding. It will taper off to spotting, even go away completely for a day here and there, and then picks right back up like a light period. There are no clots and the color is pink, brown, or dark red. No bright red. My betas are dropping and are apparently very low so I don't think there's any retained tissue. I'm not having any cramping or anything. It's just...there. I had a moderate SCH with this pregnancy, so I'm sort of thinking it could be related to that. Anyone else experience this? I have another blood draw early next week so I'm wondering if I just wait until then and bring it up to my dr or if I should shoot her an email. Help?\n\nEdit: bleeding picked up a little this morning and I passed a couple of quarter-sized clots. So it seems like there was some retained tissue or something. It's slowed down again, so I'm going to wait and see what happens the rest of the morning and then maybe call my dr at lunchtime. Thank you guys for all of your responses!

I'm still a little unclear on when I need to give a trigger warning. I did read the rules and this post mentions details of my MC so I erred on the side of caution. \n\nI had a very typical MMC with my first ever pregnancy: I had my first u/s at 10 weeks and there was no heartbeat. I feel guilty that I'm still so affected by it, especially when I read the stories here about some of the things that you all went through that were so much worse.  My heart goes out to you all. \n\nOf course we heard all of the \"this is so common\", \"this must have happened for a reason\", and \"you'll be pregnant again soon\". Even our doctor said \"this is good news because it means you can get pregnant!\"\n\nExcept I haven't. And it's been three years. I've had issues and a few procedures and my body is not cooperating. We're looking at IUI but I haven't been able to make the final push because a part of me wonders how if I couldn't carry a child and now can't ovulate and can't stop bleeding I will be able to successfully carry another pregnancy and I'm scared. On the other hand, I'm 35, almost 36, and so I know I don't have forever.  \n\nI was always so careful to not become pregnant when the time wasn't right. I'm a planner. But I can't plan my way through this. I know lots of people who've miscarried but no one who remains childless since. As each month passes I can feel a ball of fear and resentment growing larger. While lurking so much of what you (collectively) say resonates with me and I thought maybe it was time to join in. Especially if we make the jump to more invasive help with conceiving.
