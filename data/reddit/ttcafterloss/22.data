I'm brand new to reddit (shocker, I know) but I've been reading through this board for a while now and found it extremely helpful. We started TTC at the end of October15 (probably in the middle of my cycle? i had no clue about anything TTC related then). I have really long cycles (37-44 days with a 50 day thrown in there). We so very luckily got pregnant during our second cycle trying and I made it to 6w4d before I lost that pregnancy (January 19, 2016). My body (and husband) bounced back pretty quickly (I got my period again Feb 24), but mentally that waiting period was pretty tough on me. I felt like I failed, and was (am?) terrified of never getting pregnant again or having a successful pregnancy. I'm working through it and am in a better place now. \n\nCurrently 10dpo of our first cycle trying again after our loss. Looking like it will be a 44 day cycle and I'm probably out (tested today, BFN). I'm feeling ok about it right now, but I will probably be more of a wreck when AF shows up. I think what really frustrates me is that my cycles are 1.5 times longer than average and it feels like they take for.ev.er. It just feels like such a waste of time to go so long between ovulating. Anyone else feel the same way? I feel like my way of problem solving and feeling like I am \"fixing\" something after my MC would to be just to get pregnant right away again and all would be ok but thats clearly not the case. \n\nSomething else thats a constant kick in the gut and reminder of my loss is that my SIL is currently pregnant. We would have had the same due dates. They announced to us their pregnancy a week after we lost ours. We didn't share with them what we went though so they don't know anything.

If this pregnancy had been viable I would have a baby this month (due date was April 1st). TW: mentions living child.\n\n----------------------------------------\n\nI'm writing this both because I'm trying to process what I've gone through and because I'd like women to keep my experience in mind should anything similar happen to them, with hopes that it can be recognized far sooner than was my case. Thank you for reading. TMI warning, of course...\n\nMy husband and I have a 19 month old son and after a pregnancy \"scare\" we decided to plan for a second. Much to our surprise and delight, I fell pregnant the first month of trying.\n\nI was alarmed to experience brown spotting for all of week 5, but I was assured that it was normal. I didn't think it was normal for me, but I accepted the advice of my nurse. I was happy not to have the morning sickness I did in my first pregnancy but I did find myself with frequent gas pains which were very uncomfortable. I felt terribly bloated and had such a belly that my boss pointed it out when I was only seven weeks.\n\nAt seven weeks and three days I was on the metro on my way to work when I began to feel faint. I thought it was because I only ate an apple that morning and had low blood sugar, as had happened once in my first pregnancy. It was bad enough that I asked someone if I could take their seat. It didn't get any better and was actually getting worse so I started to weakly ask and call out for someone to help me, if someone could give me food. I was given a Kind bar that I had trouble eating and a man helped me get off at the next station, which was actually my station. He supported me to sit down and I had trouble eating the granola bar or drinking the Gatorade I was offered. \n\nI just was not feeling any better and was only feeling worse and my stomach was cramping from the very top to the very bottom, all over. I was sweating profusely and could hardly sit up by myself. At some point I threw up all over the floor. A woman with a baby try talking to me and I could tell she was very worried but I never saw her face. She called my husband from my phone to come meet me. I was surrounded by people but I didn't see any of their faces through my cold sweats and pain.\n\nEMTs came to take me to the hospital. They didn't really do anything to me or for me and joked amongst themselves. I was sure that I just needed to eat something but no one would let me. I figured I probably should stay home and not go back to work that day. I thought about refusing to go to the hospital but I decided that since my insurance was so good it couldn't hurt to go. They asked me if I had a preferred hospital and said they could request it but it was pretty far so I decided to let them take me to the closest one, which I'm very grateful for now. I asked the EMTs if it could be an ectopic pregnancy and they said they didn't know. I was given oxygen but I still had shortness of breath due to anxiety.\n\nWhen I arrived at the hospital I wanted to pee and they needed a urine sample anyway. A young EMT said, \"you can walk, right?\" and I said sure. I was directed to a bathroom that was through a windowed isolation room and I closed the door and lunged for the toilet. I barely managed to capture some urine and flush and tried to leave quickly because I was feeling so faint. While trying to leave I collapsed in the isolation room and I couldn't reach the emergency buttons. I was starting to blackout and feebly called for help but even though the door was cracked no one could hear me. This was terrifying. I was partially conscious when I was found by someone who tried to help me up and drag me out. I remember saying \"I don't want to do this.\" After all this, that guy lost the urine I somehow managed to collect.\n\nI was on a stretcher by the registration desk for a while turning, writhing, moaning in pain and I had no idea that my husband had been there and couldn't find me. When they asked me to describe the pain I also told them I had pain in my shoulder, which I was not aware is sometimes a tell-tale sign of an ectopic pregnancy.\n\nWhen I was given a bed in the emergency room wasn't long before my husband found me and a doctor came to me. I asked the doctor if it could be an ectopic pregnancy and they said it could be several things and they would check for them all. At this point I felt that I had a lot of gas and thought that maybe if I could go have a bowel movement I would feel all better (???). In reality, I was not able to sit up let alone make it to a bathroom.\n\nThey brought in ultrasound machine and went from looking at my stomach to looking all the way up to my sides. My husband said there were several people and they were looking at each other with crazy looks. Someone asked someone else, \"do you see all that fluid?\" They asked me if I knew what an ectopic pregnancy was and I was just relieved that they figured out what was wrong with me.\n\nThey immediately wheeled me out and called to my husband \"walk with us, walk with us!\" and took me to a white room with those big circular white lights. I internally begged them to knock me out as soon as possible. The doctor explained that there would be just a small incision. They couldn't find any veins due to my blood loss so they stuck the IV right in my neck. They put an oxygen mask on my face and their voices synthesized to a strange high-pitched noise before I was completely out.\n\nIt wasn't until I was no longer on morphine that I realize how serious the situation was. When the surgeon spoke to me he explained that I had lost almost half my blood volume into my stomach. They replaced two units of blood during the operation and removed one of my fallopian tubes. I was leaking blood for weeks beforehand and thought it was gas pain. I was essentially dying that day and I had no idea.\n\nI am now recovering at home and in a lot of pain. My incision is about 8 inches long but healing well. I can't pick up my son and I can't go to work, or walk much at all yet. The surgeon tells me I will be at a higher risk for an ectopic pregnancy but I should have no problems conceiving and giving birth to another child in the future. I did not have any of the risk factors for ectopic pregnancy (fertility treatments, STDs, IUD, et. al.).\n\nI don't want the story to scare anyone necessarily because I feel that there are several points in the story that normal person would recognize that there was something terribly wrong and seek help. This is extremely rare but is a cause for maternal death. The rate is higher for women who don't have access to medical care (which is why it is higher for black women in the US). My first ultrasound and midwife appointment was scheduled for the day after this occurred. In the future I will be monitored with blood tests and ultrasounds much earlier to ensure a healthy pregnancy.\n\nI feel overwhelmingly blessed to have been helped by strangers and operated on really quite quickly. My husband and my son are my world and I cannot bear the thought of leaving them without a wife and mother. I lost a little baby but I hadn't yet met that baby. Joey says she'll be back sometime. I'm so thankful to return to my life after all of this. I'm hoping for a beautifully boring future.

I've been lurking for awhile and I figured I should introduce myself.\n\nLast August (2015) I found out I was pregnant. At 5 wks I had some spotting. I'm talking like one drop of red blood. My stomach sank when I saw it. What a terrible terrible feeling. I had an ultrasound 2 days later. The dreaded silence from the ultrasound tech spoke volumes and I knew things weren't looking good and that was no heartbeat. When the Dr. called later she said they thought it was a blighted ovuum since there was just a gestational sac. I was told I should start bleeding soon. I felt like I was walking around with a ticking time bomb just waiting for the miscarriage to start. After 2 weeks of nothing, I was scheduled for another ultrasound. This time there was a baby and a heartbeat! I quietly shed a few tears seeing that beautiful little baby and hearing the heartbeat. Bad news was the baby was measuring 2 wks smaller than it should have and that the amniotic sac was oddly shaped. But there was hope. I went back for another ultrasound the following week. That's when all hope was gone and I saw that the heartbeat was no longer there. I had a D&amp;E later that week. That was 5 weeks of hell full of hope and dashed dreams. But I was feeling well before my 2 week follow-up appointment and was ready to get the ok to start trying again. Well that hope was shot down too when my Dr. told me it was a partial molar pregnancy. Wtf?!? Seriously body. Let's just add more pain to this process. I bawled my eyes out on the way home from that appointment since that meant no trying. I had to have weekly blood draws until my HCG was negative, which was the first week of Jan. Now I have to have monthly draws until June to make sure I don't get cancer from it. Ugh, ugh, ugh.\n\nI'm dreading May. Because of how everything happened I was never given a due date, but it would have been late May. June can't come soon enough. I just want to be able to try again!!!\n\nTime to go back to lurking until June :(\n\n\n", "stickied": false, "subreddit": "ttcafterloss", "subreddit_id": "t5_34scd", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Intro", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/ttcafterloss/comments/4dn9g1/intro/"}, {"author": "lkeal022", "author_created_utc": 1459819157, "author_flair_css_class": "", "author_flair_text": "31, stillbirth @ 39w", "author_fullname": "t2_wvwjs", "created_utc": 1459979684, "domain": "self.ttcafterloss", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/ttcafterloss/comments/4do0jl/intro_son_born_still_at_39w/", "gilded": 0, "id": "4do0jl", "is_self": true, "link_flair_css_class": "intro", "link_flair_text": "Intro", "locked": false, "media_embed": {}, "num_comments": 21, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/ttcafterloss/comments/4do0jl/intro_son_born_still_at_39w/", "retrieved_on": 1463526396, "score": 27, "secure_media_embed": {}, "selftext": "I heard about this sub from a friend I met at a perinatal loss support group (thank you, if you're reading). I so appreciate the support group, but sometimes feel that once a month isn't frequent enough. \n\nFive months ago yesterday, my son Jay was born, though his heart had stopped beating sometime earlier. The day before, I went to my routine prenatal appointment after 4 days of what I thought  (and was told) was pre-labour: intense menstrual-like cramping. I had also lost my mucous plug 3 days earlier and was excited to be feeling contractions any day. Then, my appointment. Doppler. Silence. Slow heartbeat (mine). Silence. Me: Is there a problem? Dr: I'm not hopeful. Me (in my head): do your fucking job and find his heartbeat. Silence. The beginning of the end. \n\nJay's death was confirmed at the hospital. I was induced and delivered him the next day. He was absolutely perfect. We held him and kissed him. We took pictures. We sobbed for three straight days at the hospital. Then we were discharged, went home - to our quiet, empty home - and fell apart. \n\nWe celebrated the gifts Jay brought us at a memorial service the next week, November 12 - his due date. The room was beyond packed with everyone in our life. More people attended Jay's memorial than did our wedding. I was touched and honoured and crippled by it all. \n\nI took my maternity leave of four months and actively grieved every day. My husband and I shared everything with each other and promised to be honest and forthcoming. He is my rock.\n\nWe learned the cause of Jay's death three days before my return to work: GBS infection. I would have had an imperceptible rupture of my sac and the bacteria that I was housing reached and contaminated Jay's protective environment. Here I am a month later, having partially digested this last piece of the puzzle. We are ready to try again, excited to grow our family, forever missing our baby boy.

I'm currently only drinking when AF visits, but otherwise I'm still eating all the things you can't when pregnant, like cold deli meat and medium rare steaks. Is this a bad idea during the TWW? When do you all start cutting those things out?\n\n2) I'm pretty active and run about 25 mpw these days (down from 45 before injury and my last 2 pregnancies) and lift 1-2 times a week. I set a PR in my 5K last month and plan to go after that goal again at a 5K I'm running in 2 weeks. Obviously if I get a BFP before then my plans will change. My question is about my training run this weekend. I'm scheduled to do 5 miles \"fast\" which would typically put my HR around 172. This is well above my \"easy\" runs where I'm in the low 160s and can easily carry a conversation. Should I be starting to take it easy now, or should I wait for the BFP? \n\nI'm excited to see how everyone here handles these things. The TWW is always such a weird time!\n\nEdit: I should clarify for point 2 that I've talked to my doctor about my exercise when I'm pregnant. I am just unsure if it's crazy to go that hard during the TWW.

Absolutely gutted. I hate that she now knows the pain of loss and want to comfort her the way she and others comforted me when I had my loss. \n\nI am going to put together a bag of things for her and drop it by her house tonight and was wondering what some of the best things in the care packages you received were.  \n\nFor me, it was flowers. The life in them brightened my spirits every time I looked at them and I have constantly had bouquets of flowers in my house since my loss (it was not my norm before that). So I know I will be getting her a big bright bouquet. I also will be writing her a heartfelt card, which I feel is obvious but also was incredible to on the receiving end of.\n\nWhat gift or gesture comforted you ever-so-slightly in your darkest hour after your loss?\n\n**EDIT**: Thank you all for sharing your beautiful stories and the things that comforted you in the days following your loss. Last night I went and picked up a gorgeous yellow tulip plant (living), a few magazines she would love (home d\u00e9cor and cooking), a vanilla candle and fine vanilla tea (I find vanilla to be very comforting), a bottle of wine and her favorite organic vanilla bean ice cream. My husband and I wrote a heartfelt card and then I ding-dong ditched it all at her front door. \n\nI found out she had not told any family she was even pregnant and she is not intending to tell them of their loss, therefore I feel like I need to step it up an extra bit for her. She is having her d&amp;c early next week so this weekend my husband and I are going to cook a huge pot of chicken soup and delivery it to her and her husband.  From there, I will see what else I can do for her, emotionally or with little gifts.  Again, thank you all. This community is the very best.

Her heart just stopped beating and they never found a cause. I am now 16w5d pregnant (only pregnancy other than my stillborn daughter). \n\nThe day before yesterday I went to a general check up appointment and my blood pressure was 140/90. The nurse asked if it's been high in the past, and to be honest I'm not sure. They take it every time I have an appointment with my midwife and mfm but have never mentioned it being high. I called my midwife after that appointment and told her about my blood pressure being high, and also mentioned some bad headaches and hand swelling I've been having. She spoke to a doctor and called me back saying they wanted to run a PIH panel to check for preeclampsia (she said it was very doubtful id have it this early but this way theyd have the numbers if something happens later on in the pregnancy). Well the next day they called and said that there were indeed abnomalities in my blood test and that the doctor wanted to start me on labatelol 100mg twice a day, and just to take it easy and try to lay down as much as possible. How do I have it this early? Is there anything else they should be doing? They didn't even check my urin for protein or anything. And on top of that when I took the medication last night I got extremely dizzy, confused, a horrible headache, and just felt very very strange. I can't do anything until my office opens again Monday morning. I should mention that I also have the MTHFR gene mutation (i am taking baby aspirin for it). Could they have made a mistake? What does the PIH panel even measure? And could this have had anything to do with my stillbirth? \n\nSorry this was so long I'm just really confused and worried.

I've been in the 'TWW', and yesterday I took a dollar store test and it was negative (Yesterday was day 23 of my cycle). In the past, it hasn't affected me this much but I'm just feeling exhausted. I don't think it worked this month either. I've been noticing that when we're around friends, we are able to relate to conversations less and less since most everything focuses on whose baby did what at which age, etc. (we have a few babies among our circle of friends). They're all being \"parents\" and I feel that my husband and I are so out of place. As happy as I am for them, I can't help but feel bitter and I hate that I feel that way. I feel hateful, but my husband says that it's because I'm just hurting. I miss my little poppy seed. I'd have been over 20 weeks now. I can't stop the tears from flowing. Please tell me that there could be a light at the end of this. \n\nI told my husband that we're going to have to skip any upcoming activities with friend groups with a lot of kids, and spend some time with our fellow childless friends and with each other. I'm just burned out, smiling with them and asking questions about their babies while being very aware of my empty uterus. We have a great group of friends and none of this is their fault, it's me. I can't handle it. I'm also feeling bitter that we've basically put our life on hold as far as taking vacations, being able to eat and drink what we want, etc. It's all worth it, but on days like today, I question it and get so angry and so done with it.

All together, I didn't receive my final HCG draw until 6 weeks post loss and started my first period before my HCG was zero (It was a 157 for reference, and was 4 a week later.)*\n\n*I'm in my first cycle of TTC after the loss, and I feel like there was a real shift for me when I ovulated. It helped me to know that my body was doing the right thing again, that we could try to conceive (which we are currently, I'm in the TWW.)*\n\n*Getting my first period was extremely challenging and triggering for me. I would describe the two weeks after that as the hardest since the loss began, actually. It also happened that I received a pregnancy announcement that day, which was the same day I would have been 12 weeks, which as many of us know is such a mental milestone. It was devastating, and a week later I finally agreed to go on zoloft. It was the right decision.*\n\n*I still cry and feel grief, I think about our loss often, about how far along I would have been by now, and the little life we will never be able to enjoy. I don't know if I will 'get over it'.*\n\n*I feel like everyone who was checking in on me sort of checked out around the time that I regressed, which was and is really hard. I haven't moved on, I still need support and love and encouragement, but I don't feel like others in my life understand that.*\n\nI mentioned in that post that someone had announced their pregnancy to me. It was done in a... sort of insensitive way, by sending me a text of her positive test and the comment that she knew it must be a little bit hard for me to see. This happened at 8 am on a Monday morning, I work from home and ended up having to take a day off. I had a complete emotional breakdown that day, cried for so many hours I gave myself a migraine. I never told her that. Basically it was the moment I finally started to process how horrible I felt and how sad I was that other people's pregnancies only reminded me that my babies had died. \n\nIt was very triggering for me, but I also pushed through, gave her my congrats, and did what I could to be supportive while also protecting myself. I didn't ask her many questions or engage much about her pregnancy - although we were talking about all sorts of other things - and after a week or so later, she stopped speaking to me out of the blue.  \n\nThe tough part is that this was actually my bestie who did this. I'm talking we email every day and text every day, and suddenly? Nothing. I told her I'd gone on the zoloft over a month ago (an email she ignored until now) and still nothing. I gradually started to coax her back into engaging with me (see my trigger comment below) and now, she decided to tell me what her reasons were for not talking with me the last 5 weeks. She told me that she pulled away because I made her feel like she had to dampen her joy, that I felt it 'wasn't fair' that she was pregnant and she SHOULDN'T be pregnant. \n\nI have so many emotions about all of this. This is exactly what I meant when I said that people expect you to move on, just be happy for them, and stuff away your grief. Once your baby is gone, people offer you condolences and then, they forget. \n\nI have more to add to this, but it includes a trigger warning so I'm going to add it into my comments below.\n\nI'm sad, I'm angry, and I don't even know where to go from here.

Went through the weeks of testing and got the okay to start trying again in January. So it's now the end of April and I'm still not pregnant. \n\nI'm feeling a bit stressed about it as I got pregnant so quick the first time - 6 weeks after I stopped contraception. I'm a type 1 diabetic, and I'm 29. I'm worried if we have another unsuccessful pregnancy it will be months again before we can try, then months before we would potentially get pregnant.. \n\nI guess I'm worried I'll get to the stage that the doctors will tell me I'm too old to keep trying. I've been told in the past that they prefer diabetics not to have children after 35... That doesn't really leave all that much time. \n\nI've gone onto a few support groups for women who have had partial molar pregnancies but I haven't seemed to find anyone who is also diabetic, so I haven't really been able to talk to anyone who j think understands where I'm coming from on that side, though I'm sure many people have similar frustrations. \n\nHow long should I wait before I discuss with my GP? Before the pregnancy they said give it a year.. But I'm not sure if that would be the same advice now?
