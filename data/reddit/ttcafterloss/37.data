My (very pregnant) Doctor asked me if maybe my dates were wrong, but I took OPK's last month and know exactly when I ovulated - should have been 7w3d, just had an empty 5w sac. I kind of had a feeling it wouldn't work out, my betas started on the low side and I had no symptoms for the past week, and as soon as I saw the ultrasound screen I knew it wasn't normal. I'm disappointed and hurt but I'm so much more emotionally prepared for this than I was the first time, so there's that. That makes 2 losses back-to-back, I guess I'm in the minority now?\n\nI have my misoprostol tablets on the counter, just waiting 'til tomorrow morning to take them to start the process.\n\nI asked Doc what testing options were available... so she's running blood tests on my thyroid and on anticardiolipin antibodies. But she didn't really offer anything beyond that, and I'm not sure what else I need to be looking for. I'm O+ blood type so Rh sensitivity isn't a worry.\n\nI heard something about 23andme being able to diagnose MTHFR gene mutations... is that a good first step?\n\nIf you wonderful folks know of any other options for testing I'd be most appreciative. My insurance only lets me see specialists through referrals, and Doc didn't seem overly eager to send me to a genetic counselor or anything yet. Should husband be getting a Sperm Analysis? He's currently uninsured as he recently lost his job but if it's affordable out-of-pocket is it something we should look into?\n\nThanks much, friends.", "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "ttcafterloss", "subreddit_id": "t5_34scd", "suggested_sort": null, "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Back here again. &lt;/3 Blighted ovum, 2nd loss.

We were hoping it would happen but we weren't BDing as much or when we should. Around September I believe we were really trying actively. We started with daily BD and then switched to EOD when daily didn't do anything for two cycles. \n\nWe got a BFP at the end of January and we were so excited!! We didn't expect that at all. I had gotten a BFN that Tuesday with FMU on FRER, BFN Friday after work on FRER, and when AF didn't seem to be showing up Saturday, I tested on Sunday with FMU with E@H and got 3 faint BFPs and a BFN on a FRER Digi. I confirmed at the clinic Monday that I was pregnant. \n\nWell this past Monday I spent the evening in the ER for bleeding. Wednesday my OB confirmed my levels were dropping and I had miscarried. I was only 6 weeks.  DH and I have been pretty upset over it but we are ready to jump back into the saddle ASAP. \n\nI think what made this more exciting for us and then even more devastating is that DH is getting deployed in a few months and we were happy to have it before he left. Now I'm hoping those fertility rumors have some grain of truth to them because we really want to try to conceive again before he deploys. So that's what I'm dealing with on top of losing my little sweet pea.

On Monday Feb. 13th, using FMU, I took an FRER and it came out positive. Two days later, on the wednesday I experienced some very light pink bleeding, was assured it was fine but took another FRER to see. Went to the store, bought one,  went home and didn't use FMU, but still got a positive that was slightly darker than Monday's result. \n\nI called my doctor and went in for an appointment the next day, the bleeding had increased and was a bright almost still pink red before attending the doctor. I took a urine sample at the office and some clots were forming. Nurse did a urine test and said it was negative. She sent me for blood tests to confirm, and I received a call today that those were also negative (she said my HCG was around 4, which is considered negative).\n\nI've had what basically is a period since Wednesday, just ending this morning. So, I guess I'm wondering was this a CP? My doctor said I just got two false positives, but it seems odd that I would get two false positives on two different days and with tests even bought on different days.\n\nEven if we are not pregnant anymore, I just don't believe that we never were, which is what the doctor's saying.

In all likelihood we dodged a bullet, and as my husband said, it's better that we suffer for a bit than the kiddo suffering for a lifetime, if in fact it had some kind of disorder or condition. Still, I feel so worried that it'll happen again :( I'm 33 in a month, so neither young not old, but just on the threshold for higher risk everything...our doctor recommends waiting 3 cycles and taking birth control pills during that time to help regulate and heal everything. Have any of you lovely ladies taken pills after your MC? I'm worried that they will make it harder to get pregnant afterwards.

I have had 5 losses: 1 miscarriage at around 7 weeks in grad school in 2009, then 4 early chemical pregnancies this year. The most recent one was two weeks ago. \n\nAll of this year's losses have been incredibly early, happening around 10 or 11DPO. I get a faint positive pregnancy test, then incredibly heavy bleeding and intense pain. (The first time it happened, I wasn't testing early so I actually went to the hospital, thinking a cyst had burst or something). \n\nI recently saw an RE who says that they do sound like early losses, and will be doing rpl testing and karyotyping, along with a bunch more thyroid tests (since some of mine indicated problems). I'll also be starting progesterone after my 7DPO progesterone test, to see if that makes any difference.\n\nTo be honest, I took the first 3 in stride, but I've been struggling after this fourth loss. I took the negative comments on r/infertility really hard -- harder than they warranted -- and ever since I feel like I've fallen down a dark hole. Three felt like bad luck, but 4 feels like I will never be pregnant. I haven't told that many people, but a few of the people I've told have blamed my busy work schedule and have said I'm pushing myself too hard. I really worry that this will never happen.\n\nFor those of you who have had repeated early losses, does it ever get routine? I thought I was handling this well, but I don't think I am anymore.\n\n", "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "ttcafterloss", "subreddit_id": "t5_34scd", "suggested_sort": null, "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Introduction - 4 Early CPs in 1 Year", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/ttcafterloss/comments/5uwzfm/introduction_4_early_cps_in_1_year/"}, {"author": "AutoModerator", "author_created_utc": 1325741068, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_text": null, "author_fullname": "t2_6l4z3", "brand_safe": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1487488205, "distinguished": "moderator", "domain": "self.ttcafterloss", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/ttcafterloss/comments/5ux6d8/ttcafterloss_ttc_daily_discussion_thread_february/", "gilded": 0, "id": "5ux6d8", "is_self": true, "link_flair_css_class": "ttc", "link_flair_text": "TTC Thread", "locked": false, "media_embed": {}, "num_comments": 26, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/ttcafterloss/comments/5ux6d8/ttcafterloss_ttc_daily_discussion_thread_february/", "retrieved_on": 1489565796, "score": 3, "secure_media_embed": {}, "selftext": "**This thread is for members who are TTC or waiting to try.

I even left work today because I just couldn't pull myself together. \n\nI have a therapist, my husband listens as much as he can, and I have a friend I text quite a bit, but I'm hoping someone can give me some insight on how not to be a depressing, crying monster for the next 28 days.

In January I arrived home from a vacation to find a letter had arrived for my first prenatal appointment. It felt like a punch in the gut. My husband ended up going into the doctor's office personally to inform her and tell her how upset it made us. He said she was apologetic so we chalked it up to an unfortunate oversight and moved on.\n\nYesterday I came home to a second letter from the hospital reminding me of my appointment. I was livid. I called my doctor and far from being mortified that this happened twice now, she couldn't have been more cavalier. Her response was \"oh yeah, sorry about that, I'll take care of it.\" I reminded her that my husband had talked to her the first time this happened and it was supposed to have been taken care of then.\n\nI had been having a pretty decent day up to that point but having that wound reopened again sent me into a tailspin. I ended up drinking too much, getting into a huge fight with my husband because I feel he's just moved on so easily, and cried myself to sleep. Today I feel so hollow and I'm still so angry with my husband. I just want him to *feel* something, to acknowledge how much it fucking sucks to be surrounded by people who seem to have the ability to will themselves pregnant when it sometimes feel like it will never happen for us, and if it does it will be tainted by the shadow of our first loss. I don't want him to dismiss my feelings by saying \"we'll get our baby one day.\" I don't want *a* baby. I want the baby I should be seeing on a scan for the first time on Friday.\n\nI know my grief cannot come close to comparing to that of most others here, so I hope it's ok that I'm venting.

Unfortunately, they have no way of measuring placentas through ultrasound, so they had no way of knowing. \n\nLuckily, the doctor was in agreement with pretty much everything I had hoped for in terms of any future pregnancy - more checkups, doppler studies, only seeing one doctor instead of multiple, and delivery no later than 34 weeks. She also suggested we go see a perinatologist at one of the major teaching hospitals for a second opinion, though I have no doubt they'd agree with the findings. Oh, and she also said we can try again as soon as we want, as long as I'm taking a multivitamin (which I always do anyway).

We began our married life with the agreement that until we were better off financially, we would not try to get pregnant.  She was on the pill and we used condoms if she forgot to take a pill. After three years of hard work, we fill we're ready. We decide at first that we'll just stop using any birth control and if it happens, it happens. \n\nAfter a while, we actually begin to try. We charted her ovulation, took her temperature every morning, and reading as much as we could about what we could do to get pregnant. We did everything but go to a doctor. Like most people, we were afraid of being told that we couldn't have children. But then last December, our prayers seemed to have been answered with a positive pregnancy test.  We ended up taking 4 tests just to make sure it wasn't a false positive. \n\nFor the next month, we contacted an OBGYN for an appointment, made plans of how we would announce, who we would tell first, and talking about all the things we would need to get. But our joy was short lived. While my wife was out of town, she called me and told me that she was bleeding and cramping.  When she got home we went straight to the emergency room. They confirmed the pregnancy and then tried to find the baby on an ultrasound but could not. They also said her hormone levels were low. Our OB appointment was later that week so the emergency room doctor told us to go home, be on bed rest, and then go to the OB. However, if there is any change, such as extreme pain or bleeding, to head straight back to the emergency room.  \n\nThe next morning I leave for work and my wife stays at home and I tell her to call me if anything happens.  Right as I'm pulling into work, my wife calls me and I can tell that she is in pain.  Our conversation went something like this:\n\nMe: Are you okay?\n\nHer: I don't know.\n\nMe: You don't sound okay, I'm coming home right now. \n\nI told my boss and I rush home. I had to practically carry my wife down the stairs of our apartment and put her in the car. We rush to the hospital and every bump in the road seems to send waves of pain throughout her body. \n\nAfter getting to the emergency room things moved like a blur. They got her into ultrasound and you can seen the serious look on the ultrasound tech's face. As we're heading back to her room, the nurse meets us in the hallway and asks, \"Was it positive?\" and the ultrasound tech just nods. Within a minute, a doctor is in the room with us explaining to us that she will need to be have surgery. She had an ectopic pregnancy, it had implanted in her Fallopian tube, and it had burst. Blood was leaking into her abdomen and she would need to have the burst fallopian tube removed. It wasn't even noon yet and I was giving my wife a goodbye kiss as she was being wheeled into surgery. The surgeon came out and told me that my wife had made it but that if I had waited even just a little while, she would not have made it. \n\nIt's been a month since the surgery and we've received a huge outpouring of support from our friends and family. We've been working through what's happened and it's finally hitting us that we've lost our baby. We're doing everything we can to keep our hopes up for the future but for now, we're still in mourning. We're feeling crushed by the fact that one moment we're getting ready to become parents and the next my wife is having surgery to save her life and our baby is gone. \n\nTL:DR - We lost our baby and almost my wife due to an ectopic pregnancy.
