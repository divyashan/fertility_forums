However, one of the MW from my OB office just called me with the results of the second draw from Friday and it is 200 points lower.

I'll let you know if I find anything out in my workup that I'm going to ask for. Hugs to you all. \n\nEDIT 2: I spoke with my MW. She suspects either ectopic (because of the levels and timing of hcg)  or just an early fluke due to something wrong with the embryo and that it's not likely to be an issue with fertility. As of note my very first miscarriage was at 6 weeks and I had my daughter shortly after that. She said I'm healthy and have very good chances of conceiving.

I love him so much and could not be as together as I am without him here.\n\nWe got the rushed labs back and it told us that, based on the HCG, this wasn't a viable pregnancy for awhile.  Numbers were so very low.  The doctor says my body probably held onto it for awhile and then just couldn't anymore.  They are treating this as a normal period, thus, and aren't requiring me to do any more monitoring.  Said we could try again ASAP and that we shouldn't worry.  The doctor said this was actually in some ways good. I have endometriosis and my worry was getting pregnant not so much staying pregnant.

Whether the child is five, forty, or yet to be born, there is no period of time in which a parent\u2019s love for their child isn\u2019t all encompassing-and entirely decimating to lose.  It\u2019s difficult to explain to someone who has never experienced the loss of an infant or of an unborn baby, just how affected we are by the loss of our babies.  Parents are met with comments like, \u201cyou should be glad it happened before they were born, and you got attached,\u201d or \u201cyou can always have more,\u201d or \u201cat least you have a child at home already.\u201d  What people outside of this special loss community fail to understand is that a positive pregnancy test brings with it an imagined life, entirely lived in our heads as we picture who that baby will be, who will they look like, will it finally be a little boy in the family, and just about any other aspect of a new life that can be considered.  In those first few minutes of known existence, a mother will be picturing that child graduating from college, or becoming a doctor or lawyer.  She will have dreamed of every insignificant thing she wants to teach her baby, every activity she wants to undertake with her son or daughter, and every hope and dream she will ever have for that little life she has just discovered living inside her.  From that point on, the bond simply continues to grow as she begins to learn her child\u2019s personality, and there is definitely a little personality being developed and learned from very early on.  Every kick is a communication between mother and child, every hiccup is an opportunity for the expectant mother to coddle her baby, trying to soothe those hiccups away so her baby can sleep.  Every pain, ache, tear, moment of nausea and sleepless night that comes with pregnancy, is endured for the promise of a beautiful little person as a reward at the end of the journey.  Every day that baby is carried and nurtured inside his or her mother\u2019s body, is another day for the expectant mother to fall a little bit more in love with this amazing person she is growing. \n\nWith the death of that child, at any point in pregnancy, not only comes the loss of that child, but the loss of every dream a mother or father has had for that child.  Every imagined scenario in that child\u2019s life becomes a loss, the space that would have been the baby\u2019s is a gaping hole in their home, a constant reminder of the life they will never live. In many ways, the loss of those dreams is worse than the loss of a person already having been a part of someone\u2019s life.  When a friend or family member dies, we mourn the loss of their presence, we miss the things we used to experience with them, we mourn the place they held in our lives.  With the loss of a child or an unborn baby, we are left with endless questions and no concrete idea of what we will be grieving.  Every period of time that passes, the grief evolves into something new.  Would that baby have been anything like our neighbour\u2019s five year old daughter, if she had survived?  Would he be playing on the baseball team with his older brother?  What would he look like today?  How different would our lives be, if our babies were still here?  Even the experiences we take most for granted, like remembering someone\u2019s eyes, or the sound of their voice, are mourned, for those parents who never experienced their child alive, outside Mom\u2019s body. \n\nAs a result of those intense feelings of grief and loss, and the lack of understanding from the world around grieving parents, the isolation, devastation, and helplessness they experience, is incredibly difficult to work through without the structure of support that is unique to pregnancy and infant loss.  The comments by friends and family that are meant to comfort and soothe, feel abrasive, and hurtful.  It\u2019s impossible to understand what it is a grieving parent needs to hear unless it\u2019s experienced firsthand, or an attempt to learn what can be done for them is made.  No parent is ever the same again after experiencing the loss of a child.  A new pregnancy is met with fear, and the belief of another inevitable death, no matter how unlikely it may be.  Never again will she start a baby registry in her first trimester.  She may avoid joining prenatal groups or classes, may choose not to tell anyone about their new baby until late into the pregnancy, may not look at names until the baby is born, and may not buy a single item for that baby, until they bring him or her home.  The na\u00efve joy that the parents, unaffected by pregnancy and infant loss have is lost to those that will never forget the child they will never know.\n\nOne in four pregnancies will end in loss, statistically speaking.  Twenty five percent of unborn children will die.  An immense number of families will be forced to grieve the loss of their child during pregnancy, birth or the first year of life.  And yet, Ontarians as a population, are still relatively uninformed and na\u00efve when it comes to pregnancy and infant loss and the repercussions it has on Ontario families.  That will change soon.\n\nDecember 8th, 2016, in Toronto, Ontario, marked a historic day in Canadian history. Bill 141, also known as the Pregnancy and Infant Loss Awareness, Research and Care Act, was enacted into provincial legislation making Ontario the first Canadian province to recognize pregnancy and infant loss as a national issue to be addressed.\n\nBill 141, introduced to parliament by Lawrence-Eglington MPP Mike Colle, seeks to develop research into the causes of pregnancy and infant loss, in the hopes of eliminating the factors that may play a part.  Initially, the bill also sought to develop specialized programs within hospitals, to accommodate families experiencing pregnancy loss or still birth; creating areas to deliver deceased babies in a positive and nurturing environment, with staff fully trained to meet the needs of bereaved parents, as well as funding and directing families to support programs, such as the Pregnancy and Infant Loss Network, or PAIL.  The bill has been amended to be incorporated into the current Ministry of Health and Long Term Care Act, but what that means for the bill itself isn\u2019t quite clear.  The final victory achieved by the baby loss community is the official recognition in Ontario of Pregnancy and Infant Loss Awareness Day on October 15th and the hope that awareness can be spread throughout the province on the frequency of baby loss, as well as the understanding of the specialized grief and needs of those families affected. \n\nAs a volunteer for the PAIL network, I am familiar with the importance this organization plays in the healing process of parents of who have experienced loss.  PAIL offers support groups that meet once or twice a month led by trained facilitators who themselves are bereaved parents.  These groups allow the newly bereaved a place to speak about their babies in a place where they can feel safe, and understood.  They can hear the stories of people just like them, to learn that they are not alone in the strange and sometimes terrifying feelings they are experiencing, and that their own unique grief process is perfectly normal and natural. PAIL also offers one to one telephone support, again with trained volunteers, also bereaved parents, to those who prefer a more private setting to speak, or who are not located near a support group.  As a result of the passing and publicity of Bill 141, the amount of bereaved parents, being introduced to the PAIL network for the first time, is staggering. The intake for the month of December alone, has increased by over 400 %, leaving staff and volunteers scrambling to meet the needs of these parents seeking help, without the support of Government funding.  PAIL network and its members have been instrumental in assisting with the passage of Bill 141 and continue to do incredible work in the community to help those who have nowhere else to turn to meet the unique needs of a parent of baby loss.\n \nIt is the fervent hope of those who participated in the parliamentary process of Bill 141, myself included, that the awareness created by the publicity of this bill alone will create a new network of support and knowledge with which the general population can support friends and family who are, or will be experiencing the loss of their baby.  With the development of research and education, we have the possibility of creating a more hopeful outcome for every pregnancy undergone, and a positive, and beautiful experience for those that end. It is with great pride that I continue to speak on behalf of Bill 141, in any way I can, to spread the awareness that needs to be given, on behalf of my first two sons, Perrin and Matteson.

I had not had any miscarriage symptoms whatsoever (no spotting, cramps, etc), and that is probably because I had a good-sized corpus luteum cyst producing progesterone and maintaining the pregnancy. I took vaginal cytotec yesterday morning after the ultrasound, and finally started having some bleeding last night around 6pm. The cramps yesterday were bad, but the bleeding was relatively light compared to what I was expecting. I am going to have another ultrasound this week to make sure I passed it all. One thing I am worried about now is how fast this corpus luteum cyst will regress and if it will keep me from ovulating and having a real period. I know corpus luteum cysts are common and are a good thing typically in normal early pregnancies, but it seemed like the ultrasound tech made a big deal about how big mine was and how that was what was preventing me from miscarrying on my own.

Anything can remind you of these things, remind you of your pregnancies and losses. \nOne miscarriage makes you feel horrible, lost, confused, alone. By the fourth you're just numb. Oh sure you're still excited every time you see that positive test, can't help but dream of the life you will have... But it becomes just another number. 4th pregnancy, week 6, 4th miscarriage, bleed 5 days, no period for 6 weeks. All just numbers. \nAnd the idea that, after adding up all the pregnancies and how far along each was... the idea that had it been one pregnancy... I could have known if it was a boy or a girl. Had it been one pregnancy, my baby would be x days/weeks/months/years old. \nBut how do you describe these feelings? How do you explain to someone who has never been through it, what it feels like when you see your friends or family, pregnant or with a new baby. That every time someone asks \"when are you going to try?\", as if you weren't trying already! That every time someone asks, it tears your heart a little but more. You see women happily pregnant, or worse, not wanting to be pregnant, and you die a little more inside because you so badly want that to be you.\nHow can all that be explained? The grief never leaves. It's a weight you carry with you, always. People will say, just don't remember that... don't remember that on this day, a year, or two ago, I lost my 1st, 2nd, 3rd baby... How can I forget?! Those were the days my world crashed around me... the days a portion of my dreams died. I want so much to be blind to the dates, oblivious to the amount of time that has passed that I have gone without that wonderful baby in my tummy, my arms... my life. If there was an amnesia pill, would I take it? Probably not, the pain would still be there. \nI go on living with this pain. I am told I have a bad attitude...I'm called negative. But this is who I am. Every loss has turned me into the person I am today. I am not afraid to speak of my losses, but I don't say how much each loss hurt. The person who I am is not perfect, but crawling through life just waiting for the storm to pass... waiting for my rainbow.  If that makes me a bad person, so be it. You don't even know.

A few days ago, I found out I was not only still getting positive HPTs, but they were getting darker and darker. The question: was I still pregnant?? If so, HOW?\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nSOOO... long story short, I *was* still pregnant. I got my blood work done. HCG was 118, then just one day later, 212, and the doctor said it was a good doubling rate (27 hours, when they want 48) and the numbers looked like normal numbers for 4 weeks. BUT I would have been nearly 7 weeks at that point. She said that if I was 7 weeks my numbers wouldn't be this low, and if I'd miscarried a pregnancy that would have now been 7 weeks 2 weeks ago, my numbers wouldn't *still* be this high, and they wouldn't be increasing, either. So one way or another, my situation was bizarre. She and various nurses got my hopes up, and almost had me convinced that either I WAS somehow 4 weeks (which made no sense, the BFP before my period made me at least 6 weeks, and I would not have had time to get pregnant *again* at that point), or that, at the very least, the growth had somehow paused and then started up again, like some kind of crazy miracle, and I was going to just proceed as normal from here on out. \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nNo such luck. Starting Wednesday I bled again, on and off, for 24 hours. Yesterday the doctor called; my 3rd HCG was only one point from the previous. So, experientially, this is my second miscarriage for the *same pregnancy*, because I lost it the day after my first BFP, thought I had it back, then lost it again yesterday. \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nSomehow, though, I am less sad this time around, and more relieved. I don't know how I would have handled my anxiety during the pregnancy if it had hung on a little longer, with such low numbers and such an inauspicious start, I would have just been waiting for disaster. The last few days I have been a wreck, forever in and out of hope, terror, and wishing I could just see a good sign or a bad one soon. I knew a bad sign was more likely, so I'm almost grateful. I know that sounds horrible. I just want a pregnancy that doesn't start out spelling certain doom.

I'm having symptoms similar to when I was pregnant once before (cramping, no nausea but needing to urinate more frequently, occasional sore back, fatigue). I know similar symptoms can also show up before a period, but my BBT has been high &amp; hasn't dipped yet. The other months in which I WASN'T pregnant definitely had my BBT dip by now (even with my PCOS/irregular periods). I'm currently 13DPO - I was 11DPO when I got a faint positive result before. I've tested the 1st morning urine a few different times over the last few days, but not even a faint positive yet (mostly one brand of testing strips, still good, but I used an early response store brand this morning &amp; still nothing). I'm trying not to call my DR's office until I at least see a faint positive (don't want to go for nothing), but I'm getting a little more anxious every day.\n\nHas this ever happened to anyone else? I don't want to 'jump the gun', but like I said - I already had a positive result by now the last time (I ended up miscarrying, but that's neither here nor there in this situation - I think). I WANT to be pregnant obviously, but I don't want to be setting myself up for disappointment either if I get my period in the next couple days. I figure if I don't get my period by the end of the week, I'll definitely consider calling my DR (though again - I'm trying not to w/o a faint positive b/c it's a little difficult for me to get time off of work {I work as an MA in a small DR's office})..... urgh.

When Walker was born and died we were given a bear and having something tangible to hold in those dark times was comforting and it made me feel like he mattered to the staff. I would like to offer other parents who are grieving that same comfort and the knowledge that they are not alone in their grief.\n\nI donated two bears in honor of /u/hippopotamuscles ' s son James in November and the experience was comforting and healing.\n\nIf this is something you would like to take part in all you need to do is:\n\n1) Purchase a new medium-sized stuffed bear. Try to choose one that is cute, but not cartoon-happy, if that makes sense. [These are the bears I donated in November for James and Walker.](http://imgur.com/YoSW9vT)\n\n2) Make a tag for the bears. I want these to be something simple, something that will let the grieving parent know they are not alone, include a little about the baby you are remembering, whether it's Walker, your own, or any other baby you wish to buy and donate a bear for, and direct them to a place where they can talk to other parents who understand their pain. The email address I created is walkerandjamesbears@gmail.com. I have to give a nod to hippo's son James as he sparked the idea. [Here is a sample tag.](http://imgur.com/a/kpZH0) Simply attach the tag around the bear's neck with yarn.\n\n3) Ship or deliver the bears to your local hospital's labor and delivery. I had considered having all the bears sent to the hospital where Walker was delivered, but shipping even light objects long distances could become cost-prohibitive and I really like the idea of our little babies having an impact across the globe. I also want to avoid flooding the local hospital with a number of bears that will be unwieldy and difficult to manage, as the program here is administered unofficially by nurses. If, by chance, your local hospital will not accept such a donation then I can gladly give you the address to send them to for the hospital where Walker was delivered as they will accept such a donation.\n\n", "stickied": false, "subreddit": "ttcafterloss", "subreddit_id": "t5_34scd", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Bear Drive in Memory of our Babies", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/ttcafterloss/comments/48mfy3/bear_drive_in_memory_of_our_babies/"}, {"author": "horse_apple", "author_created_utc": 1380739746, "author_flair_css_class": "", "author_flair_text": "34, TTC#2, #1 Newborn lost 5/1/2009", "author_fullname": "t2_dd0u0", "created_utc": 1456932988, "domain": "self.ttcafterloss", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/ttcafterloss/comments/48mmwj/tough_morning_worried_for_a_friend_trigger/", "gilded": 0, "id": "48mmwj", "is_self": true, "link_flair_css_class": "trigger", "link_flair_text": "Trigger", "locked": false, "media_embed": {}, "num_comments": 3, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/ttcafterloss/comments/48mmwj/tough_morning_worried_for_a_friend_trigger/", "retrieved_on": 1463440218, "score": 7, "secure_media_embed": {}, "selftext": "I apologize if this is a weird or disjointed post.  It's been a heck of a day already and then I got to work and it got even stranger.  I mostly just want to get this off my chest.\n\n  I work for a newspaper as the creative consultant in the advertising department and we are a pretty close knit bunch of ladies.  A girl who hasn't worked here very long but is the same age as me (34) and quite a lovely person inside and out was pregnant with her second child.  She is due at the end of May.  The pregnancy wasn't planned and she was really bitter about it at first.  This kinda ruffled my feathers because I think every baby is a precious gift, but I also understand my views and values on human life are a little skewed due to my experiences.  This morning, I got to work and found out she had her baby last night, a (THANK GOD) healthy, breathing on her own 2lb 14 oz baby girl.  I broke down and cried.  My daughter was born a little earlier gestational age than this little one and did not live long.  I'm sure all of you know the feeling I can only describe as \"happy-jealous\" every time you hear of someone else falling pregnant and I was mega happy-jealous these past few months.  I can't explain how awful I feel for being jealous, worried I am for Friend and Baby, overjoyed that Baby survived, and chock full of self pity.  What a mix of ick!  I was going to get married this summer but we had to push the wedding back and put our ttc plans on hold (urgh!  seriously life?!).  Because of the self pity crap, i feel like a total jerk.  I'm so worried for my friend.  She doesn't know I also had a premature birth and I don't want to visit her and bring it up because, well, duh.\n\nThis brought back a ton of feelings from my own experience.  I already locked my keys in my truck and had a 5am anxiety attack of absolutely nothing.  IT'S A WEIRD DAY.   My fiance is so sweet and patient.  He has a raging cold and woke up to help me calm down and shimmy my truck lock open.  \n\nThank you so much for listening and pardon me if I broke any rules with this post but I feel good getting this out!", "stickied": false, "subreddit": "ttcafterloss", "subreddit_id": "t5_34scd", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Tough morning, Worried for a friend [Trigger Warning - Infant loss]", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/ttcafterloss/comments/48mmwj/tough_morning_worried_for_a_friend_trigger/"}, {"author": "[deleted]", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_text": null, "created_utc": 1456939008, "domain": "self.ttcafterloss", "edited": 1456939194, "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/ttcafterloss/comments/48n3qs/tw_tfmr_its_been_one_week/", "gilded": 0, "id": "48n3qs", "is_self": true, "link_flair_css_class": "trigger", "link_flair_text": "Trigger - TFMR", "locked": false, "media_embed": {}, "num_comments": 12, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/ttcafterloss/comments/48n3qs/tw_tfmr_its_been_one_week/", "retrieved_on": 1463440436, "score": 13, "secure_media_embed": {}, "selftext": "[deleted]", "stickied": false, "subreddit": "ttcafterloss", "subreddit_id": "t5_34scd", "thumbnail": "default", "title": "[TW: tfmr] It's been one week.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/ttcafterloss/comments/48n3qs/tw_tfmr_its_been_one_week/"}, {"author": "Hippopotamuscles", "author_created_utc": 1397183364, "author_flair_css_class": "", "author_flair_text": "TTC #1 - James Leo lost to IC at 18w - 11/15/14", "author_fullname": "t2_g2obg", "created_utc": 1456959156, "domain": "self.ttcafterloss", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/ttcafterloss/comments/48oul9/its_been_a_while_but/", "gilded": 0, "id": "48oul9", "is_self": true, "link_flair_css_class": "chat", "link_flair_text": "Chatroom", "locked": false, "media_embed": {}, "num_comments": 14, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/ttcafterloss/comments/48oul9/its_been_a_while_but/", "retrieved_on": 1463441251, "score": 13, "secure_media_embed": {}, "selftext": "Hippo is in the chat. \n   \nhttp://webchat.freenode.net/?channels=%23ttcafterloss ", "stickied": false, "subreddit": "ttcafterloss", "subreddit_id": "t5_34scd", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "It's been a while but...", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/ttcafterloss/comments/48oul9/its_been_a_while_but/"}, {"author": "AutoModerator", "author_created_utc": 1325741068, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_text": null, "author_fullname": "t2_6l4z3", "created_utc": 1456988548, "distinguished": "moderator", "domain": "self.ttcafterloss", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/ttcafterloss/comments/48qxp4/ttcafterloss_ttc_daily_discussion_thread_march_03/", "gilded": 0, "id": "48qxp4", "is_self": true, "link_flair_css_class": "ttc", "link_flair_text": "TTC Thread", "locked": false, "media_embed": {}, "num_comments": 121, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/ttcafterloss/comments/48qxp4/ttcafterloss_ttc_daily_discussion_thread_march_03/", "retrieved_on": 1463442225, "score": 6, "secure_media_embed": {}, "selftext": "**This thread is for members who are TTC or waiting to try.

I had a MC on Christmas Eve. My partner and I tried to get pregnant for almost 2 years with fertility care. We ran out of money and were emotionally exhausted. So we took time off from trying. I lost some weight and gained some more control over life. We decided to try again, and within 2 months I was pregnant. \nWe were sooooo excited. We told everyone when we thought we were 6 weeks along. The MC and the D&amp;C and all that mess were awful. But having to tell everyone about it was the worst. \nNow we are cleared to try again, but I am feeling more ambivalent about pregnancy than ever before. At first, trying to get pregnant was fun, intimate. We got so close to each other sharing this common dream. Now I feel like being hopeful or excited or even saying anything out loud about it is a jinx. I've been disappointed so many times and I feel like keeping my expectations low is self preservation. \nHow do you get back that initial excitement after a MC? How do you let yourself be happy about a future life, while you realize that life may not actually happen for you? I know it is stupid, but it feels like talking about it made it go away.

I never anticipated this worry.  FML.  I knew pregnant people were going to bother me but man, some things just surprised me about the emotional toll of this M/C.  It's now been almost 2 weeks.  I've been around people outside of work and home like once.  It was not a good experience.  We went to a homebrew meeting.  Everyone was pregnant.  And then my husband gushed over his best friend's wife's pregnancy.  I know he's just happy for his friend and I told him I don't mind him congratulating them but the whole thing got out of hand and someone said \"any idiot can have kids\" and I outed us.  Which, honestly, wasn't the part that bothered him.  He just didn't think a pregnancy we found out about before anyone even knew WE were pregnant was going to be triggering.  We've since talked a LOT since then thanks to the recommendations on here and he's more aware of what is making me feel awful.  After three days of crying, I'm finally starting to be on the mend again emotionally but he's being protective and wise and suggesting that maybe a family Easter gathering is not the best of all ideas right now.  Basically, he says if we feel up to it, we've got time but that we should just stay home if we are even in doubt and take care of ourselves.\n\nI know a lot of you have experienced a loss near a big event or holiday and you must have a lot of words of wisdom.  I could sure use some.\n\nAlso, my husband's family has absolutely been supportive but they are very \"stiff upper lip\" sometimes.  His mother seemed genuinely confused as to why this could be hard for us when he explained it to her.  TBF, they are not the type to ever ask or pressure about babies.  Hubby is the only one with kids and is the baby-baby and the only one still in the age range of reproduction.  Still, his mom seemed confused and re-emphasized that his sister who is organizing their 50th anniversary is using the time for a dual-purpose family meeting.  We weren't aware of that plan until today so we aren't sure what to do.  I've sent her a FB message kind of laying out our worries and that we'd prefer just to meet with her or take directions but that we aren't sure we're up to Easter.  I'm sure she will understand but it makes us feel awkward nonetheless.\n\nEaster is something we (even non-religious people) do because it makes his parents happy and we get to see his favorite aunt.  But neither of us feels like celebrating yet and think we should wait.  FTR, we also have his parents' 50th coming up at the end of April.  I will have to be over it by then and am hoping that my successful dissertation defense will soften the blow of that stress.\n\nHow the heck do you deal?  What do you say when people ask questions that are, yes, totally out of line but not meant to be ill-meaning?  It was bad enough having endo and knowing I could be infertile.  I had a lot of stress before family gatherings because MY family was just bizarrely nosy and really doesn't approve of my education.  Thus, my extended family tends to make me feel shitty for not reproducing.  Even my mom has put pressure on me sometimes.  His immediate family is very chill but not the type to always be super gentle about things and he does have some loony extended family that are consistently rude to me about not having kids of my own/comparing me to his crazy ex.  Normally I would just try to make them feel comfortable/ignore it but launching into tears seems to be the only way to handle this right now.", "stickied": false, "subreddit": "ttcafterloss", "subreddit_id": "t5_34scd", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Easter/Passover/Family Stuff... how do you deal with it?", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/ttcafterloss/comments/494tf9/easterpassoverfamily_stuff_how_do_you_deal_with_it/"}, {"author": "AutoModerator", "author_created_utc": 1325741068, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_text": null, "author_fullname": "t2_6l4z3", "created_utc": 1457247745, "distinguished": "moderator", "domain": "self.ttcafterloss", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/ttcafterloss/comments/496c7w/ttcafterloss_ttc_daily_discussion_thread_march_06/", "gilded": 0, "id": "496c7w", "is_self": true, "link_flair_css_class": "ttc", "link_flair_text": "TTC Thread", "locked": false, "media_embed": {}, "num_comments": 50, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/ttcafterloss/comments/496c7w/ttcafterloss_ttc_daily_discussion_thread_march_06/", "retrieved_on": 1463449551, "score": 5, "secure_media_embed": {}, "selftext": "**This thread is for members who are TTC or waiting to try.

Everything looks great, said the Doc. She did an internal ultrasound and everything is recovering fast and well. We can start BDing again whenever we want (I want!!), I can work out hard again (can't WAIT to do that today at the gym: endorphins = happiness for me right now), and we can try again for a baby whenever we feel emotionally ready. \n\nHusband and I wanted to wait to ttc again until we heard from the Geneticist regarding the fetal tissue analysis - and we can't believe it but we heard from her TODAY. Results show that there was an extra chromosome 21 (totaling 3). An extra chromosome is not inherited genetically. That means it was a fluke. A freak occurrence. That we were basically just really unlucky.\n\nI am thrilled.\n\nI am finding deep comfort knowing that.  I feel like I can get excited to try again for a baby, rather than be scared that we are going to conceive again, pass along something genetic and have to go through this experience again.  It's all very emotional and wonderful and I am feeling grateful and happy in the midst of this terrible ordeal.\n\nHoping you all find some brightness in your day today, too!  \n", "stickied": false, "subreddit": "ttcafterloss", "subreddit_id": "t5_34scd", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Finally something good!", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/ttcafterloss/comments/49e4ny/finally_something_good/"}, {"author": "JennieLeeFox", "author_created_utc": 1444840620, "author_flair_css_class": "", "author_flair_text": "TFMR triploidy, 3/16/16", "author_fullname": "t2_r6lm0", "created_utc": 1457387003, "domain": "self.ttcafterloss", "edited": 1457540555, "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/ttcafterloss/comments/49ez0n/introduction_upcoming_tfmr/", "gilded": 0, "id": "49ez0n", "is_self": true, "link_flair_css_class": "intro", "link_flair_text": "Intro", "locked": false, "media_embed": {}, "num_comments": 29, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/ttcafterloss/comments/49ez0n/introduction_upcoming_tfmr/", "retrieved_on": 1463453649, "score": 17, "secure_media_embed": {}, "selftext": "So I have been lurking this subreddit for the past couple of weeks.

This is a lethal anomaly in which every chromosome is tripled. My doctors have suspected this since we got our first trimester screening results back (normal NT, extremely low PAPP-A and HCG). They attempted a CVS 2 weeks ago, but couldn't get a sample due to location of the placenta. Last Friday I had my amniocentesis (turned out to be a huge ordeal due to my retroverted uterus and tendency to vasovagal).\n\nI cried constantly the past couple weeks, but now that I actually know I just feel so numb. I have a consultation for termination tomorrow afternoon and I think we're going to have a D&amp;amp;E depending on what they recommend. I live in a state with moderately strict laws, so we have to wait at least 24 hours after the consultation and signing the papers and I'm going to be forced to have one last ultrasound to see the baby (and make me feel more guilty about this decision). \n\nI feel like I'm just a mess right now and cannot even gather my thoughts properly, but I just wanted to get this off my chest in a supportive community. \n\nUpdate: \nWe have to wait until 3/16 for the procedure. \nMy doctor was really amazing and is bypassing the state required ultrasound at her own risk because she doesn't want to put us through that painful experience. \nShe also said we can have a chaplain come to bless the baby.\n\nThe one thing I can truly appreciate out of this very painful time is that people have been so kind and compassionate (especially you all).

One thing that I'm really finding tough to come to terms with is the feeling that I've changed, that I've lost myself and my identity. While my 'old self' was in no way tied to having children, I was fiercely independent and had a strong sense of who I was and proud to be that person (most of the time), I enjoyed my job for the most part, liked hanging out with my friends and had clear goals for my future. I've been through a lot in my short 27 years and those things have created resilience and forced me to become intimately acquainted with my inner self and my thoughts and emotions.\nBut I feel like I've lost all that. Everything. I'm hugely dependent now (on my husband) and feel like I've just changed into 'a person who lost their baby' rather than any semblance of 'me'. I no longer am sure about what career I want and have recently quit my job as I'm not coping (plus 2 colleagues my age are pregnant and due the same time I was, I'm sick of being told I'm lucky I wasn't 'drinking the same water' as them and am not pregnant). I look at the person in the mirror and often don't connect it with myself, that sounds silly but it's my reality.\nDid/does anyone else have really strong feelings of loss of identity/extreme personal change?

Didn't even know this one existed until I was redirected here thanks to a kind user! \n\nMy wife and I had our 9 week ultrasound appointment last Monday morning and the OB revealed to us that she no longer saw a heartbeat after we had just seen our little one on the screen coming along the previous week. This is our second miscarriage in a row; the last pregnancy ended on Thanksgiving day just this past November (7 weeks). We are devastated having to go through this twice in the last 3 months.\n\nAs tough as it has been for me, I know my wife is even more lost now than she has ever been. As much as she knows it's not her fault, she can't help but feel like it is. It was even more devastating this time having seen the baby on the ultrasound and then losing it. Last time we didn't quite get to the u/s before we saw bleeding and a trip to the ER confirmed our fears. Of course I support her every step of the way and there is nothing I won't do for her right now, but I still feel helpless and so does she.\n\nWe are undergoing some additional testing now to see if there is anything the doctors can find that might help us, genetically. They also mentioned that next time we are pregnant they will start her on progesterone therapy from the start. I just wish someone had tested us for hormone levels this time around because if that is in fact the answer, maybe we could have done things differently this time. We'll also have the fetus karyotyped since she passed it today. Upon taking it to the OB, OB saw us to discuss the blood panel she ordered after the news last week. OB mentioned my wife tested positive for anticardiolipins. She couldn't tell us anymore about it other than to say we need to have a repeat test done in 12 weeks to see if they are still there, which indicates an autoimmune or thrombic disease. She mentioned treatment for it is heparin or baby aspirin, but said if it is the case she will have to refer us to a high risk clinic (MFM) to treat. Do we start treating now with baby aspirin? What if we become pregnant before the repeat 12 week test?

She and I often talk about our adventures in infertility land. Since I joined this sub last summer, I have become familiar with so many other permutations of infertility and loss. \nRecently, we were talking about all the tests she was given to diagnose the cause of her infertility. I was impressed with how many procedures were done. I found the contrast between our medical stories kind of interesting. Once you have been successful (arguably just lucky) in reproducing and you can get pregnant \"easily\", the course of action just seems to be to continue to let you try. In my case, most of those \"trys\" ended up being failures. Heart-breaking failures. I feel like TTC#2 with unexplained RPL is this odd subculture of infertility. Clinicians don't seem to know what to do with us unless we have something easily detected like a coagulapathy or thyroid disorder.  \nPerhaps this feeling of medical limbo opens old wounds. I also have another chronic illness, Crohn's disease, with no known etiology or solid treatment that comes and goes as it pleases.

I felt very pregnant, with all the classic symptoms of insane nausea, fatigue, etc. and had great HCG levels...just no baby.  To say it was a huge disappointment is an understatement.  My husband and I had been trying for about 8 months and were so excited to get the positive test, but I started spotting and then had the ultrasounds, and it all went downhill from there.  The doctors and nurses who handled the D&amp;C were amazing and caring and made the experience as good as it could possibly be, but it was still a stressful experience.  Also, the ultrasounds indicated that I have a uterine anomaly, and they want to do further testing (HSG and hysteroscopy) to determine what kind of anomaly I have, so I'll be back to the hospital for that testing soon, because they want to check that out before they clear us to try again.  \n\nAll of this is to say:  I very, very much want to have children still, but this experience has been so heartbreaking and painful that I'm not sure how to mentally gear myself up to try again.  Not to mention all the time off of work that I had to take for doctor's appointments and surgery and will need to take for the uterine anomaly investigation.  I'm terrified of having to go through this for a second time, or who knows how many more times.  I have never felt less like myself, not just in terms of feeling sick and tired, but the sadness and the depressed feelings just left me feeling ungrounded.  I didn't care about any of the things that usually motivate me, or excite me.  I feel much better now, but I don't know how many times I can deal with losing myself like that.  Does anyone have any advice on how to conquers these fears and move forward?  And also, does anyone have any boundaries that they've drawn up for themselves regarding when they'll stop trying, for the sake of their mental health?", "stickied": false, "subreddit": "ttcafterloss", "subreddit_id": "t5_34scd", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Struggling Emotionally with Beginning to TTC Again After Loss - Any Advice?", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/ttcafterloss/comments/49q6w1/struggling_emotionally_with_beginning_to_ttc/"}, {"author": "AutoModerator", "author_created_utc": 1325741068, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_text": null, "author_fullname": "t2_6l4z3", "created_utc": 1457593346, "distinguished": "moderator", "domain": "self.ttcafterloss", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/ttcafterloss/comments/49sffw/ttcafterloss_ttc_daily_discussion_thread_march_10/", "gilded": 0, "id": "49sffw", "is_self": true, "link_flair_css_class": "ttc", "link_flair_text": "TTC Thread", "locked": false, "media_embed": {}, "num_comments": 162, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/ttcafterloss/comments/49sffw/ttcafterloss_ttc_daily_discussion_thread_march_10/", "retrieved_on": 1463460067, "score": 5, "secure_media_embed": {}, "selftext": "**This thread is for members who are TTC or waiting to try.

I was due on 7/11/16. We found out that we were expecting a girl a little over two weeks ago in our anatomy scan. I unfortunately went in to premature labor on Monday, 2/29 late afternoon. I thought I was having braxton hicks, but after a gush of fluid and an hour or so after that of wondering if was just discharge and if I would get laughed out of the ER, I finally decided to go in after calling a 24 hr nurse line and she also thought I should go in. I was timing them and just wasn't ready yet to understand what was going on since I was only 21 weeks. My intuition had told me to pack a hospital bag the Friday before, so luckily that was ready to go with a special blanket I had sewn her. The entire pregnancy I thought that something would go wrong. I think I knew all along that something unexpectedly bad would happen. When I saw my OB a few hours after delivery she said something to the same effect. Like, you were low risk and nothing medically pointed us in that direction so we never could have known, but you knew. I was low risk for my entire pregnancy, but I insisted on going to high risk OB and doing extra testing because I thought that I would end up high risk. Once I got to triage and checked out on 2/29, they confirmed that they could see only amniotic sac, and no cervix and that they couldn't do a cerclage since I had ruptured already. My water fully broke like a huge gush just like in the movies when I was in the bathroom. The docs were amazing when they explained that she would be delivered that night, that there was a bad infection. It turns out it was a fetal infection, and I will always wonder how she got it, what I could have done (even though I know nothing deep down, etc.) They mentioned that she needed just three more weeks to be viable, but those three weeks meant everything and in this situation, there would be no NICU team to resuscitate her and that I would go through normal labor and delivery, but at the end, my baby may or may not be alive and that she would die shortly after even if she survived the birth. I got to my labor suite at about 12:30 or so and contractions started getting more intense around 2 or so. I got some IV pain meds and then an epidural which kicked in just in time. I pushed a few times, but the doc decided that we would give it time and just let her work her way out of my body. She was breech, but small so they weren't worried about me delivering vaginally. The worst parts were feeling her feet wiggling around between my legs and then I just felt her head slip out without even pushing. I just felt like I failed her.  Scarlet Elizabeth was born over four months premature at 21 weeks, weighing at 1 lb .8 oz, and measuring at 11 inches long. They said that she was a big baby for her gestational age. I knew she would be a big baby : ) She was gorgeous! Best button nose and perfect little lips. Just looked like a normal baby but tiny and asleep. Her color on her body was pretty red/purple but her face was normal color. They cleaned her up, pulled the placenta out of me (probably the worst pain of all of it), and they she died in my arms. We held her for almost nine hours after that. It was a blur. She was wrapped in the special blanket I made for her. The doc was pregnant and hugged me and walked away crying when her shift was over and it was time for her to go home. My nurses were amazing, everyone was amazing. We had her baptized. We sang to her, talked to her, kissed her all over, took pictures, laughed, cried, had a dance party, facetimed with friends and grandparents. We fit as much as we could in to the time we got to be with her body. They discharged me by noon on 3/1, so I was only at the hospital something like 16 hours. I read once on this sub that you have to hold something in your arms when leaving the hospital without a baby. I had a football hold on her special blanket I sewed for her that she had been in for the last nine hours. I held my head do high and wore my tears proudly. Nurse Deb hugged me and held me and was protective of me as she wheeled me. Hubby has been taking great care of me. My pain is minimal. Having bleeding and same recover as any vaginal delivery. Baby was small so no tearing. Doc said worst damage done to my vagina was her rooting around for placenta. Keep rubbing where my bump was, which is hard to stop doing. Don't feel much like talking to family or anyone besides my husband. My employer paid fly my mom which is nice. My husband and I take turns snuggling her blanket, are both crying, and helping each other through it. I keep having to remind myself that she isn't in the blanket since we spent so much time with her when she was wrapped up in it. I have packed away all my little girls clothes I have bought, all of the gear I bought in advance on sale, and my maternity clothes until I need them again. It was comforting receiving the last two orders from Carters that I had placed.  I made the last order on the day when I went in to labor and spent so much time picking out each thing, so it made me happy to lay her clothes out on my bed and touch each thing. I hope to be back and my husband and I look forward to taking the next several months healing, enjoying a gorgeous pacific northwest summer, kayaking, biking, swimming, and preparing our hearts for hopefully another pregnancy. My OB already has plans to pair me with a Perinatologist to plan for my next pregnancy. There's nothing I could have done differently. I am taking time to mourn Scarlet and heal, and trying not to have regrets or think about the what ifs.\n\nI had checked out this sub before getting pregnant and have been following since we lost Scarlet. i am finding it more helpful than anything else even though we aren't ttc yet. You all give me hope and I feel so fortunate that I can consider you all my new tribe (even though it is a tribe I never imagined or wanted to be a part of). \n\nI am going to grief counseling, have plenty of time off work, am looking for a permanent counselor, and am focused on self care and keeping my body in good condition.  I want to look forward to my future and I am just kicking it \"What About Bob Style\" with teeny tiny baby steps every day. \n\nLots of love to all of you.
