I've lurked here since my first mc in October.  Just looking to vent to anyone that's been in my shoes.  \n\nSo I just had my second miscarriage in a row two weeks ago. I'm feeling so heartbroken and alone. Really, I just need \"someone\" to tell all this to who will understand.\n\nTW: I have two LC. My first dd was conceived pretty easily after four months of trying. Uneventful pregnancy. I needed to go to an RE for my second as my prolactin stayed elevated after breastfeeding and was causing me to have a short luteal phase. Also discovered to be slightly hypothyroid. Was put on meds to manage both and conceived my second dd the next cycle. Another uneventful pregnancy.\n\nLast summer we were ready for #3 so I just had my OB prescribe me bromocriptine for my prolactin. My thyroid had been well managed since being diagnosed. Prolactin went down and we conceived the next cycle. That pregnancy was uneventful until 16 weeks. I had had the genetic testing done at 12 weeks because I was 37 and all came back normal. 12 week visit baby had a heartbeat. At 16 weeks I woke up spotting one morning. Went to get checked and there was no heartbeat. Baby only measured 12 weeks 3 days. I ended up passing everything naturally at home that evening. Devastating and traumatic to say the least. We weren't able to get any answers since I passed the baby at home and we weren't offered any testing. Despite being super sad I was able to reason that it was just a random fluke, these things happen, and there must have been some issue that we just couldn't test for.\n\nAfter that I immediately went back to my RE bc I was at a new OB anyway and knew they wouldn't want to manage my hormone issues. Got back on bromocriptine and meanwhile did a saline ultrasound. Saw that I had a small polyp so had that removed in January. Was supposed to wait a cycle but I just knew I needed to try. Got pregnant in January with twins. I was so, so excited. I felt like it was just meant to be. I had a bleeding episode early on at like 6 weeks. My RE was already doing weekly ultrasounds and she saw a small area of bleeding in my uterus. She wasn't concerned and it wasn't near the babies. Continued to have instances of bleeding and got checked every time. Babies were growing and had heartbeats. Doctor just said sometimes it happens, it may resolve or may stick around the whole pregnancy. At 8 weeks 5 days I had another gush of blood. Went to get check and babies were great but the area of bleeding had grown. Doctor still wasn't concerned. That night I passed a ton of clots and saw one of the babies. Confirmed the next day that both had indeed passed. I am beyond crushed. They were fine that afternoon. Growth on track and healthy heartbeats. And then just literally ripped from inside me. Interestingly I developed a fever that same day and my doctor put me on antibiotics just in case. Although my white cell count was normal. The fever stuck around for a week until I passed a final, large clot/tissue. My doctor doesn't really have an answer for this one either. Probably related to the bleed getting larger but who knows. Not able to do testing on this one either. I blame myself because I didn't wait a month after the polyp removal so my uterus must not have been healed yet. I thought the polyp was so small it couldn't make a difference.\n\nAnyway, thank you for reading this wall of text. I just turned 38 ( day before this latest mc - thanks universe) so I feel like the clock is ticking. My family is not complete and my heart is ripped to shreds. Half the time I reason that these two miscarriages don't seem to be related and were unfortunate events. The other half I go down a rabbit hole of convincing myself my body is failing and I've got some sort of issue that is causing my body to reject my babies.\n\nI know its the hormone dump but I'm just feeling so hopeless this week. I miss the three babies I will now never know. I'll never know what they look like or hear their little voices. My husband has been great and taking care of our girls a lot while I recover. But he can just never understand the pain of losing the babies growing inside you.\n\nMy RE is following my hcg down and I'll go back on the bromocriptine and she'll do another saline ultrasound to make sure everything is gone. Then we'll try again. This waiting game is brutal. I just want to be pregnant again. Not looking like we will have a baby in 2018 now.\n\nAnyway, thanks again for reading. I know the ladies here understand. I'm having a much harder time this go round. How do you get out of your own head? Even the daily basics are so hard right now. I feel like a zombie and alternate between weeping and raging.", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "ttcafterloss", "subreddit_id": "t5_34scd", "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Intro Post - second miscarriage", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/ttcafterloss/comments/840kts/intro_post_second_miscarriage/"}, {"author": "AutoModerator", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "brand_safe": false, "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1520925089, "distinguished": "moderator", "domain": "self.ttcafterloss", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/ttcafterloss/comments/84293b/ttcafterloss_ttc_daily_discussion_thread_march_13/", "gilded": 0, "id": "84293b", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_css_class": "ttc", "link_flair_richtext": [{"e": "text", "t": "TTC Thread"}], "link_flair_text": "TTC Thread", "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "richtext", "locked": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 70, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/ttcafterloss/comments/84293b/ttcafterloss_ttc_daily_discussion_thread_march_13/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1520979468, "rte_mode": "markdown", "score": 3, "selftext": "**This thread is for members who are TTC or waiting to try.

Most of you know my story, and it's all in my post history, but I had two miscarriages, a healthy pregnancy resulting in my 2-year-old, and recently another miscarriage.  I am now 10DPO in our first cycle of trying again after finally getting all the tissue removed from my November 2017 positive pregnancy test.  I took a test today because I'm a fucking moron, and of course it's completely negative.  This has sent me into an emotional tailspin more than usual.   \n\nWhy do I have three dead babies?  This month is now 9 months we've been trying this time around (including all the time I was pregnant, the MMC, blah blah), and I was ready to have a baby already.  I thought I would be nearing having a baby by this point.  Instead I'm staring at another negative test like a moron because I stupidly thought maybe this would be our month and just couldn't wait for my period to come.  The robotic fertile week sex feels like it kills our relationship--my husband, I know, feels crappy because it seems like I only want to have sex during that week each month.  And you know what?  That's what it feels like to me, too.  It takes so much energy to be constantly wondering what I should be doing differently, what if I might be pregnant, when we should be having sex, if we had sex enough, if something's wrong, if nothing's wrong, etc., etc., etc.  I think he thinks maybe we won't get another one.  I don't know how to keep looking forward and thinking I have to do this for more months to *maybe* get a baby.  More fertile weeks, more two week waits, more symptom spotting, more planning, more energy.  It sounds impossible.  How do I keep up hope?  I'm tired, you guys.  I'm so, so **tired**.    \n\nI know I have a child already.  Shouldn't that be enough?  Shouldn't I just be grateful to have had him?  I mean, I am, I am.  Every day when I see this perfect wonderful little toddler I know how lucky I am.  And I also know how much I desperately want his sibling(s), and then it hurts.  I feel guilty I didn't appreciate *quite enough* being pregnant with him, and having those beautiful newborn days with him.  Then I feel guilty I'm not appreciating *right now* enough because I'm so sad and spent with trying to get another baby.  Every month that ticks by, I'm so aware of the growing time between him and his future sibling.  Today he patted my chest and said \"baby in there?\"  I have no idea where he got this, but it was so amazing it almost broke me.  And then I feel guilty that so many who are going through what I am with respect to miscarriages haven't gotten that at all, and then I feel like absolute shit for being sad in the first place.    \n\nOn top of all the regular TTC feelings, the terror over repeated loss, and the worry I'll never get the family I've always wanted, my skin is a mess and after the recent miscarriage I've gained a few pounds that just make me feel...off.  Nothing fits me in a way I like, and it's just a concrete reminder of how uncomfortable I feel in my body.  \n\nThanks for letting me air this.  I'm sorry it's not organized, I'm sorry for being offensive, I'm sorry it's so long.  I don't know anyone to talk to about this.  I'm just so mad, and so sad.  I feel completely hopeless.  Will I ever get the living babies I want?

I've been married for almost 6 years, and we've been trying since our first anniversary. We got pregnant quickly but had an ectopic and a few months later got pregnant again but miscarried. The ectopic made me lose my right tube and the miscarriage caused adenomyosis. We tried IVF in 3 years ago but that failed and we had none left over to freeze. We did not have money to try again until last year. When we did, we got our BFP. We were so excited but the baby passed at 23 weeks and I delivered him last month. My RE will be doing a ton of RPL testing and a sono soon. We are getting referred to MFM as well. The biggest issue right now is that my RE wants us to wait 6 months whereas my OB said 3 months. I'm just wondering what your thoughts are on trying to convince my RE to allow us to try again sooner?

Reading about all of your journeys has made me feel much less alone. I had a hysteroscopy today (at the tail end of my first period post-miscarriage 8 weeks ago). The doctor said I had a small amount of retained placenta. She attempted to dislodge it and said she thought she had loosened it enough so that it would come out with my next period. I asked if there was any reason we couldn't try this month, she said no. She was in a rush so I didn't get to follow up about it--my question is, isn't retained placenta a problem? If it's only \"loosened\" and not completely gone, couldn't that cause problems for us conceiving again? And how will I know if it actually comes out during my next period? Will it be obvious?\n The hysteroscopy hurt like a bitch and I have been bleeding like crazy all day, so perhaps it's already come out and is now a non-issue.

Just wondering if someone else is experiencing anything similar to this. Since my miscarriage last year, after 2 years of trying we have finally secured a referral to a fertility clinic. That'd due in few weeks, but in the meantime I have become so bitter. Bitter about people having babies. I work in a hospital and quite often walk past the maternity unit. It makes me irrationally angry when I see pregnant women standing outside, clearly admitted for something and smoking. Just openly, not even trying to hide it. I struggle with thoughts of how they get to have what I so desperately want, and they don't even deserve it. I can't help feeling angry, and that in turn makes me feel disgusting for even thinking that. \nIf I hear another doctor telling me \"at least you can get pregnant \"...yeah, thanks. That is totally my goal in life, to get pregnant and never carry to term and actually have a baby. \n\nI can't really use social media anymore as since I lost my pregnancy every woman I know seems to have announced hers. \n\nHusband had a SA recently, and while results were low, doctor said they are in no way \"catastrophic\". \n\nWe haven't spoken about his results at all. I tied to broach the subject the other day, as to what we would do if we just can't have a child. His response was \"if we can't, then we can't do nothing about it\" which of course is true, but there is no conversation to be had it seems. It just looks like he doesn't care. \nHe suggested that perhaps I should go see someone about my low mood, but I am mindful of that as I know it isn't the best idea to be on medication while TTC. \n\nI don't even know why I am posting, just support from people who have experienced these feeling I guess. \n\nI am 35 years old and losing hope.

Another coworker abmushed me with a \"mediation session\" (He was trying to help, but I don't appreciate that) wherein she literally cried at me because her job is soooo hard. Like, cool? So is mine and I almost died due to the apathy of medical professionals AND I lost a pregnancy? Why are we even talking about this? We're making professional decisions, not a having a competition over who is sadder???? Why is that even a competition you even think you can win?????\n\nWithout going into too much detail, everything is uncertain there. I'm going on a month long leave of absence because I cannot control my emotions there anymore, especially because this particular coworker is very abusive when stressed out, which is almost all the time. When I go back, my boss has agreed to look for another employee so I can go half time. Maybe that'll be enough? I have no idea.

I can't explain how thankful I am that this subreddit exists. I'm sorry if this is a bit scattered. I just need to get this down somewhere. I'm 28, husband is 27, and we've been undergoing infertility treatments for a year - I have stage III/IV endometriosis confirmed by laparoscopy. After 3 failed IUIs, an IVF egg retrieval, OHSS, and a CP with my first FET that was awful, we finally found out we were pregnant last month with a PGS normal girl. We were beyond overjoyed - we told our families, I downloaded a pregnancy app, joined the subreddits I had always wanted to join. A week ago, at six weeks, we had an ultrasound that showed a yolk sac but no fetal pole - but they kept saying it was too early, and not to worry. They told us to come back in a week to see a heartbeat.\n\nSo we went back today, at 7 weeks. After 30 minutes of transvaginal ultrasound, the tech looked sadly at me and went to get the doctor. There was a tiny fetal pole - measuring 5w3d, with no heartbeat. The gestational sac measured 5w. I knew then it was over, but we waited 45 minutes in silence for the doctor to come in to confirm it for us. I could feel pure grief at the edge of my mind, pushing against me, trying to get in. I pushed back, held myself together, gripped the chair with my hands. My RE doctor is always smiling - today, he walked in looking devastated. As soon as he walked in the room, all my strength disappeared and I started sobbing. He explained that with no heartbeat and measuring 2 weeks behind with a known transfer date, there is no hope. It was essentially a missed m/c. He's doing a scan for me on Friday to confirm, but explained that it is mostly for closure so that I don't have to wonder in the future. He sat with us for almost 25 minutes, hugged us, and cried with us. \n\nI really thought this was the one for us. We were so happy, so relieved, so full of hope. Now I am so tired, and so so sad. My husband and I went for a long walk which helped me get calmer, but I can still feel that grief ebbing and flowing at the edges of my vision. I know it isn't going away any time soon. I'm not sure what the next steps are - he said that would be a conversation for Friday. I'm sure it's medicine vs D&amp;C. Thank you for listening - it helps to write it down.

OR if you\u2019ve had several miscarriages this may be the reason. We have a DNA frag rate of 32 % and in studies we have about a 1% chance of natural pregnancy or IUI leading to baby.

We have continued to get pregnant naturally but miscarry. I had done a full RPL panel, have had two HSGs, an endometrial biopsy, SIS, etc. We do two cycles of IVF with PGS after so many unexplained losses. First cycle -- lots of eggs, lots of high quality embryos -- then only 2 blasts beyond Day 3. Abnormal. Told it's a fluke, do a second cycle -- same amount of eggs, worse fertilization but still all excellent quality embryos until Day 3, then 4 blasts -- again, 75+% abnormals. Took a leap of faith and transferred two mosaics as they were still deemed high quality and our doctor swore by seeing healthy pregnancies despite this. Got pregnant, chemical -- 8 total losses now.\n\nHusband has a confirmed varicocele and is getting an ultrasound in a few weeks to see whether he has more than meets the eye and does in fact need it repaired for any potential success before donor sperm (which two REs had already mentioned after these cycles). I know if he does have surgery recommended, it's still several months until the sperm are ideally better.\n\nIn the meantime, the only measure I have not had done is a lap. The only doctor that has mentioned it is Dr. Braverman after my phone consult with him -- but as many in the loss community know, he has his patented 'silent endometriosis' he assumes every woman with unexplained losses has. He said I should do a lap.\n\nMy AMH is 2.7, which is normal but low normal for my age, but my LH, FSH, AFC (Often 20+, ER have yielded 16 and 17 eggs respectively), etc. are all fine, my eggs were deemed fine after two ER (though I did have a slightly bigger drop off in mature eggs than expected, though still my total normal of mature eggs put me in 'normal territory,' and the RE wondered if it was a protocol issue since I stim very quickly), we have had one unassisted success at the beginning of all of this, and we do at least have a confirmed issue in all of this unexplained RPL with my husband's OSA/DFI.\n\nIs it worth doing a lap? I have no symptoms of endo, which I know doesn't necessarily mean anything -- but if I continuously get pregnant naturally but lose them, and have had HSGS confirmed my uterus is good, would endo be affecting it? Braverman suggests endo affects egg quality, but then in my research it specifically can affect the shell of the egg affecting fertilization/getting pregnant, which is not our issue.\n\nWould endo in tubes have been noticed at all during egg retrievals at all, too?\n\nI guess I'm asking because there is just nothing else on my end to do, and I guess I'm desperately looking for something to \"get a jump\" on things. But then I looked into laps being more invasive than I thought, as well as some things showing exploratory laps are no longer recommended. And so far, no one who's been all up in my junk has suggested it. I even read that Metformin has been used to treat endo, and that NAC is even more effective than Metformin -- and I've been on that for ages just for its miscarriage reduction effects. So I feel like I've already been treating any hypothetical endo in this method, too? But again, would endo not have been seen between a SIS, two HSGS, two egg retrievals, a million ultrasounds, etc.? Do I still need that last step of a lap before we can decidedly say egg quality isn't an issue, despite all of the things showing us otherwise?", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "ttcafterloss", "subreddit_id": "t5_34scd", "subreddit_subscribers": 3054, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "To lap or not to lap?

Not that long, but its been a brutal 3 years. To start with, I found out that I have a mitochondrial genetic disease. This disease killed my maternal grandmother, two aunts, (all younger than 60), and a cousin. I will definitely pass it on to any child I have. Therefore, my only hope to have a child, less affected by the disease is IVF with PGD. Natural pregnancy is too dangerous. \nAs I said, we started this process three years ago and about 1 month before the first IVF cycle was going to start, my mother had a stroke and died (from the disease). I was devastated but determined to do the IVF anyhow. First round was amazing! We got an egg, then it passed the PGD, then I was pregnant, then there was a heartbeat, then there was a perfect 21 week scan, then there was incredible pain and 40 hours of labor, and at 22w+6d, a beautiful little girl who died in my arms. \nThey never figured out why I went into premature labor or why this happened. We were devastated. That was 17 months ago. We are still devastated. Me more than him. \nSince then, we had a Zika false alarm that made us delay for another 3 months, then 5 more rounds of IVF.

I was confused then why my RE would recommend IUI, since that would't help me stay pregnant, only get pregnant. I talked to my doctor and nurse more, my ovulation and progesterone levels are out of wack as well, so that is the reason for doing the IUI. \n\nI actually got my period 5 days early this month (it's usually only a day or two off) which I was actually kind of happy about, because it made me think, \"Yup, I should give the IUI a try.\"\n\nWe started the process last week. Started Clomid on Wednesday for 5 days. Went back to the doctor yesterday, and my largest follicle (out of 3) was at 15mm, and he would like it to get to 20mm. Got 2 shots of Gonal F (one last night and one tonight), and will go back tomorrow to see how the follicles look. I have a trigger shot as well, but haven't gotten the go-ahead to use it yet. \n\nHas anyone else done Clomid and Gonal together? I've read a lot about people doing one or the other. Is both kind of aggressive? \n\nI haven't done as much research during this process as I probably should, and still feeling foreign to the medications and process.

We were so excited and had become so confident in this pregnancy after a positive 10 week ultrasound appointment (that I am now questioning looking back at the ultrasound photos). We had put down a deposit on daycare, I had bought some maternity clothes and a little onesie, and I had filled out a journal through the first trimester that will never be finished. Such small signs of the hope we had that are so hard to think of right now. \n\nUnfortunately, I live in Texas and have been informed I will have to have an ultrasound on Tuesday and the image must be described to me (though I can choose to look away). My husband is not even allowed to be with me during this time. It adds such insult to injury and I am devastated to have one more hurdle to bear before the procedure. \n\nThis next week feels impossible to get through and I am scared of the procedure, but I know we will make it through this. I just wanted to say hello to a group I hope to more active on soon. It is very tough to think about yet, but I know there is a time we will try again. I still have hope, although I cannot imagine ever feeling safe in a pregnancy again and it hurts to realize that has been taken from us. \n\nThank you for reading. My thoughts are with everyone here.

Last week I posted [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/ttcafterloss/comments/857w8y/mmc_hoping_to_hear_from_people_whove_been_there) about having a medical miscarriage. I first want to say thank you for sharing your stories and support; you all have made me feel far less alone and have been a great comfort this past week. Secondly, I wanted to share my adventures of the last several days. \n\n\nFriday I went in for my follow-up scan. The CNM originally said she was having a hard time finding my uterus, and brought in the OB (and his med student) to take a look. They were very concerned about molar pregnancy and told me I would need a d&amp;c within 24hrs. I was sent to get bloodwork done for HCG levels and then get another ultrasound in radiology, after which I would need to wait for the on-call gyno at the hospital to call.

We're in Canada, and our RPL clinic is at our local women's hospital.  Here's a little write-up in case it's helpful to others. \n\nOur history:  I've had 4 losses. \n\nLoss 1, May/June 2017: MMC at 11 weeks, embryo measuring a little under 8 weeks.  We saw a heartbeat at 7+5, but it was low at 129 BPM. Slight spotting at 11 weeks led to investigation. Used misoprostol. \n\nLoss 2, July 2017:  CP immediately after first MMC.  Two days of positive tests, then nothing.  Bleeding 2 weeks later. \n\nLoss 3, January 2018: MMC at 9 weeks. Embryo measuring at 6+1, sac at 7+2ish. U/S a week later (10 weeks) showed embryo at 6+2ish, but no heartbeat. Used misoprostol, had eventual D&amp;C. \n\nLoss 4, March 2018 :  CP.  3 days of positive but declining tests, then my period (about 3 days late). \n\nToday's appointment was... interesting.  We met a fellow and our doctor, who is both an OBGYN and an RE.  He has serious credentials, although a somewhat lacking bedside manner.  We learned that our second MMC had Trisomy 13, which was a bit of a trip.  I'm still processing that news. \n\nThey did an ultrasound, which was normal (although the most uncomfortable vaginal ultrasound I've ever had, and I've had a few by now).  They have ordered a hysteroscopy, which is standard procedure.  No HSG, which is fine - my tubes are clearly open, or at least one of them. They said my ovaries looked good. I found the ongoing talk about investigating my \"cavity\" amusing. Let's fill that cavity, boys! \n\nBoth my husband and I have had bloodwork ordered.  Bloodwork includes karyotyping for both of us.  I get basic thyroid (which I already know is normal), lupus anticoagulant, anticardiolipin antibodies, prolactin, hemoglobin A1C, TPO-ab, antiphosphatidylserine antibodies, and b2 glycoprotein 1. \n\nThe doctor said that for now we have a good prognosis, at 70-80% chance of live birth in the next 5 years (honestly, I'm not wild about that gaping 20-30% hole, but hey, you get what you get). \n\nWe are supposed to go back after the hysteroscopy and the initial bloodwork (everything but karyotyping). Karyotyping will take 8-12 weeks to come back, but he wants to follow up before that. \n\nThe clinic will follow us closely with betas and ultrasounds every 2 weeks until we are 12 weeks if and when we get pregnant again.  We're not supposed to get pregnant before our follow-up (no prob bob - we played with fire last cycle and got burned). \n\nI was a bit stunned by the trisomy 13 news, so I feel like I didn't get a chance to ask everything I would have wanted to.  I did ask the fellow (not the doctor) about sperm dna fragmentation testing.  I have been a bit worked up about some of my husband's lifestyle choices (smoking, level of drinking)). The fellow said that typically sperm DNA fragmentation is more often used during IVF, but we could talk about it more if the other tests came back negative. \n\nBasically, here's the deal:  we have about a 50% chance of finding something to treat.  Some of the issues they could find are treatable, as many of you know.  Some of them are less treatable.  If our karyotypes come back abnormal (about a 2-5% chance, I think), the only treatment is IVF with PGS testing (or trying and crossing our fingers). The clinic does not do IVF, and there is no public funding for IVF here (I have friends with a rare genetic disorder whose doctors applied for special funding, to no avail). \n\nOverall, I feel positive (but am, of course, obsessively googling Trisomy 13 and everything else).  It helps to know that we're taking steps to move forward. I've been struggling a bit emotionally, and this feels like movement.  I was pretty into the non-medicalization of birth and and pregnancy before, but I'm over it now. Bring on the blood tests.

I'm a longtime Reddit lurker venturing into the world of posting as I look for support following a recent loss, as I try to figure out what's next.  My husband and I were pumped when we managed to conceive in February, especially considering it took three rounds of letrozole our first time. We went in for an ultrasound on 3/8, and though the bean measured small at 5w5d, there was a heartbeat with a HR of 108. I had some light brown bleeding the following week, but it stopped and was never enough to require a pad. We went for a follow up ultrasound on 3/21, and although growth tracked perfectly (7w4d), heartbeat was gone.  \n\nNow I'm just trying to figure out what to do.  Thus far we've elected to wait and see if my body starts the miscarriage process, while weighing pills or a D&amp;C. I'm inclined to go with the latter if something doesn't start by next week as the waiting is rough, but my spouse is in the medical world and has some concern over scarring and is pushing more for the pill option. In the meantime, I go between getting through the day and then getting sad, or seemingly more often, just RAGING. I'm also having trouble with the fact that growth measured perfect to the day, and my lurking lizard brain wants a some additional confirmation before we do anything else.  In the meantime, I'll continue lurking but if anyone has any advice or words of support, I'll take them.

This would be a thread where people who are waiting or trying can ask questions to be answered by people who have had success after loss. If you're currently pregnant, however, better to ask your question in the daily alumni thread. Probably also a weekly thread.\n\n* Grief and Memorial thread. A place to specifically talk about grief and how we're handling it. Ok for alumnis and people with living children to post so long as the focus of the post is talking about their loss.

I just don't understand why this happened. Why let us think this was possible? \n\nI had been super stressed throughout this pregnancy, waiting to miscarry at any moment, cautious until last week at our perfect 12 week scan when I finally let myself believe that this could actually be happening, that this could be my happy ending. The blood tests came out great, we started announcing (due October 2nd), I bought maternity wear etc. \n\nI had some spotting throughout but every scan showed no problems and the cause of the bleeding was never discovered. I had a stomach ache last weekend and some bleeding on Monday so went in for a scan where I saw a strong heartbeat and my little one waving at me. \n\nOn Tuesday my abdominal pain worsened so I went to the ER. While waiting there I went to the bathroom to throw up and then I miscarried on the bathroom floor. It was horrible and I started screaming and then there was a whole thing, it's all a blur. We got to see him (we are waiting for tests for gender confirmation) later and say goodbye, we got his tiny footprints to take home. He was so tiny but perfect. They think an infection may have been the cause of the miscarriage but we won't get the test results for weeks. \n\nThe thing is, I have been waiting for my rainbow for 7 years now when I had my first miscarriage (mmc) discovered at 8 weeks. After two abdominal surgeries to remove fibroids, one LEEP on my cervix and one natural CP we finally tried IVF last year and went through 3 full treatment cycles. The first was unsuccessful with nothing to freeze, the second resulted in a pregnancy and miscarriage at 6 weeks and the third was a complete failure. \n\nWe were told in December that the combination of low sperm, few eggs and my wonky uterus plus our older age (38) means that our chances are slim and we should start looking at other options. We weren't ready for that so decided to take a few months off and revisit IVF in May. \n\nYou can imagine my surprise when I got a positive pregnancy test in January! And suddenly the world made sense and our troubles had meaning. It just seems so cruel to give us a miracle pregnancy for this long if it wasn't meant to be. \n\nI simultaneously feel like I won't be happy until I'm pregnant again and that I will never be able to go through this again. \n\nSorry for the long post, I think I just needed to get it out. I'm back at home now, still bleeding, crying and trying miserably to cope with the grief which seems like an impossible task. \n", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "ttcafterloss", "subreddit_id": "t5_34scd", "subreddit_subscribers": 3087, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Heartbroken after the loss of our miracle baby at 13 weeks", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/ttcafterloss/comments/87zq43/heartbroken_after_the_loss_of_our_miracle_baby_at/"}, {"author": "guiltyaslee", "author_flair_background_color": "", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [{"e": "text", "t": "31, 1 MMC"}], "author_flair_text": "31, 1 MMC", "author_flair_text_color": "dark", "author_flair_type": "richtext", "brand_safe": false, "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1522334358, "domain": "self.ttcafterloss", "edited": 1522344876, "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/ttcafterloss/comments/881s52/only_1_of_pregnancies_end_up_as_missed_miscarriage/", "gilded": 0, "id": "881s52", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "no_follow": false, "num_comments": 45, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/ttcafterloss/comments/881s52/only_1_of_pregnancies_end_up_as_missed_miscarriage/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1522379289, "rte_mode": "markdown", "score": 28, "selftext": "I read this stat today and am in shock.
