She is finally strong enough to resume normal activities like yoga and is having her first post-loss period.... so naturally our talk has turned to \"when do we start trying again?\"\n\nShe, of course, is scared of a repeat since there was some damage to the tube last time and she has been researching having a HSG test done to see if there is scar tissue or anything blocking the functioning of her tube.\n\nWe have checked into HSG and SHG tests and are weighing the pros and cons... \n\nI personally, and perhaps selfishly, don't want anything that would further delay our trying both due to our age and also due to my low sperm count and motility which will likely mean it takes a long time to conceive... however, I'm willing to go with her desire for the test to help alleviate her stress and give her peace of mind.\n\nSo, according to our research the HSG is the best kind (most accurate) of test to check for damage or flow issues but has drawbacks such as higher pain, higher chance of damage during procedure, iodine needing time to flush thus delaying the TTC process for a recommended 3 months, and of course no mambo for a few weeks ether :-/... \n\nThen there is the SHG test using ultrasound which is safer, quicker, less painful, but is less accurate and is about 3X more expensive here in China (HSG - ~130 USD and SHG ~390 USD). The good news with the SHG test is that they say you can usually start TTC about 1 month or cycle after the test.\n\nSo, we are both unsure where to go with this. Any experience or suggestions from you would be much appreciated as we have exhausted our internet searching (both Chinese and English sites) and still don't know what we should do...\n\nThanks for taking time to read and for any advice. \n\nGood luck to all of you too!

It's hard not to let it get to me knowing everyone is thinking the same thing as I am: when is it my turn? My FIL even posted on FB a few months ago about all his grandkids and \"I know I'll get a call from my son soon too!\" Hey, can you back off.\n\nMy irrational side says I don't even want to go if we aren't pregnant, but we canceled Christmas last year (literally, we went to Vegas and pretended it wasn't happening). And I don't want to sit out of life just because I feel ashamed that reality isn't matching up with my hopes.\n\nAnyway, I know this may all be irrelevant, we're still trying and it's only September (side note: probably more emotional because my last pregnancy was due this month).

I've been trying to think of questions I have in advance in case things aren't covered in what he tells me. A lot will obviously be dependent on what he says about the investigations, but here's the list I have so far. Some are specific to my circumstances and others are more general questions:\n\n* I saw my GP around 2 weeks before his death for swollen and painful glands in my neck. The GP said it was probably just a virus or something (I wasn't feeling sick at all) - could this have been a sign of something?\n\n\n* The week leading to his death I felt really terrible. Run down/very exhausted/stressed/agitated and in a lot of pain with my hips and back. I know a lot of this is generally how you feel at 34 weeks pregnant. I told my midwife the day before he died I was feeling this way and she booked me in for physiotherapy, but otherwise nothing was said. Should I have asked to be checked out further?\n\n\n* At the midwife appointment the day before he died she asked if he'd just been kicking. I said no, he hadn't. His heart rate was fast, but she just said that it was fine. Another midwife has since told me that he should have been monitored if they detected a high heart rate. Why didn't this happen?\n\n\n* In pregnancy it's generally advised you sleep on your left side. I have an old shoulder injury that prevented this so I slept mostly on my right side and sometimes my back. Could this have contributed to his death?\n\n\n* I was on medication from the start of pregnancy for HG. I was also put on medication in later pregnancy for reflux/heartburn. Could this have contributed?\n\n\n* I've had discharge from my nipples for years and my test results came back normal (prolactin/thyroid function). My research suggests that this issue isn't a condition in itself, but a symptom of another problem. Some of these problems can significantly increase the risk of stillbirth. Should I be tested for additional problems prior to another pregnancy?\n\n\n* The midwife who delivered George commented that he was large for his gestational age. They believed he was going to be around 4lb and was just over 6lb at birth. It was mentioned in passing that gestational diabetes could have been a problem, despite my glucose test being negative. Is there any evidence of this in his results?\n\n\n* The midwife commented that his cord was extremely thick when he was born. It wasn't wrapped around him to suggest cord accident, but could this have been related to his death?\n\n\n* Was the cord and placenta normal?\n\n\n* The consultant at the hospital advised that I should have tests for clotting problems. When will these tests be undertaken?\n\n\n* What was tested for in the post-mortem? \n\n\n* Should I undergo any additional tests in any subsequent pregnancy?\n\n\n* What would be the plan for any future pregnancy?\n\n\n* Will I be considered high risk? Will I be induced early - if so, when?\n\n\n* What are the chances of this happening again?\n\n\n* What can I do to help prevent this happening again?\n\n\n* Will this affect my chances of conceiving? \n\n\nI also plan on asking for a copy of the post-mortem results. \n\nHow does all this sound to anyone who's been through something like this before?

My now-husband, the absolute love of my life, and I have been married for 3 years. We had two consecutive MC - August 2016 and January 2017 - and the last one was a partial molar pregnancy and I had to be watched for complications for months and months (did you know it can turn into a form of cancer!?!?!?) It was very scary.\n\nBoth MCs came with complications - the first I hemorrhaged and bled so much I had to have an emergency blood transfusion. The second, I started hemorrhaging again but knew the signs and sought medical treatment immediately so that only resulted in two more surgeries.\n\nNow that I have the \"a-ok\" to TTC again, I'm paralyzed with fear.\n\nI'm 36. I already have an 11 year old. Do I really want to start over and risk all that heartbreak again? DH doesn't have any kids of his own and we so desperately wanted a child to share. He's such a good man - so good with my daughter and he coaches little league baseball.\n\nBut I'm terrified.\n\nHow do you get past the fear? \n\nI'm considering a therapist because I don't want to go on living this way.", "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "ttcafterloss", "subreddit_id": "t5_34scd", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Clock ticking But Too Scared to Try after 2 mC", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/ttcafterloss/comments/70veuy/clock_ticking_but_too_scared_to_try_after_2_mc/"}, {"author": "chuckitbuckit", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_text": null, "brand_safe": false, "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1505748732, "domain": "self.ttcafterloss", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/ttcafterloss/comments/70vre8/three_consecutive_losses_one_year_trying_i_will/", "id": "70vre8", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_css_class": "vent", "link_flair_text": "Vent", "locked": false, "num_comments": 10, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/ttcafterloss/comments/70vre8/three_consecutive_losses_one_year_trying_i_will/", "retrieved_on": 1505830738, "score": 10, "selftext": "We tried for my daughter for a couple of years, after many, many tests over the course of a year revealing nothing in particular we had treatment and we caught on the first cycle. My first pregnancy, my first baby. I was so grateful to have her. I still am.\n\nWe have been officially trying for another for a year again. Back on treatment after about 6 months. Got my first positive on the second cycle of treatment. \n\nWe lost it at 10.5 weeks. We thought we were safe as we had seen the heartbeat, it was so close to 12 weeks, so we told family. The day after the bleeding started. That was some news whiplash that weekend.\n\nWe thought, well. It happens. We cried. We grieved. We still do. But we felt that the loss of that baby doesn't change the fact that we wanted another, and we felt ready to try again straight away. \n\nThe dr gave us the all clear to try straight away. We have had 2 chemical pregnancies in the following two cycles. Watching those lines fade away was...hard. \n\nIt feels so unfair. So unfair that we struggle to both conceive, AND keep a baby. So unfair that my best friend is pregnant with her second (we actually had the same due dates with our firsts) without even trying, her date just weeks after what mine would have been. We should have done it together. I work in child protection and it's so unfair those parents who don't even want their children can have them. \n\nI'm sad, I'm jealous, I'm angry, I'm bitter and resentful and self pitying and my arms are empty and my heart aches. I don't want to have some of these feelings but I do. \n\nMy 2 year old daughter is obsessed with babies, like, obsessed. She sits and strokes them and says \"aaahhhh\" with soppy eyes, and cries when babies have to leave, she looks after her own doll so sweetly, she feeds it and washes it and tucks it in and shares her dummy in turns with it as she falls asleep. She would love a sibling so much. So I ache for her too. \n\nBut fuck it because what can you do but get back up and well...fuck?! \n\nSo here we go again. More hormones, more hope. It's got to be a numbers game right? It's like the gamblers fallacy, we are in too deep to pull out now, it can't all be for nothing, it would feel like a disservice to those we've lost, so onwards we go. One of the little buggers will stick. It has to. Failure is not an option. \n\nThis is a shitty shitty road and I'm sorry any of us are going through it. But I look at my little girl, who I'm so damned lucky to have, and I know all the trials are so, so worth it. So I'm keeping on trucking. Eventually it will stick. It has to.

My only time conceiving resulted in an ectopic pregnancy loss in May 2017. Initially the doctor thought I was having a miscarriage and I had a D&amp;C with no POC found in pathology. They figured I must have passed the tissue at home before the D&amp;C without realizing. I had several ultrasounds with doctors after my D&amp;C because I was still having pain and bleeding. I finally had a diagnostic quality ultrasound with an ultrasound tech at my insistence and he found an ectopic pregnancy 2 weeks after my D&amp;C when I was 9 weeks along. Unfortunately I was rushed to ER by the ultrasound tech with no explanation other than the ER nurse saying they found a \"mass on my ovary.\" I spent about 4 hours waiting in the ER waiting room thinking I might have a tumor on my ovary or an ectopic pregnancy. While I was crying in the waiting room (I don't usually cry in public, but I was so upset and scared) an older man looked at me and said \"come on, it's not so bad.\" I was eventually taken back to a trauma room and told they thought it was an ectopic pregnancy (I was actually so relieved that it wasn't cancer, even though I knew EPs were very serious). I had emergency surgery and the EP was removed from my left tube. They were able to leave the tube in place. They did see endometriosis during my surgery and associated scarring. The doctor told me it may have been a heterotopic pregnancy that resulted in miscarriage of the uterine pregnancy and a pregnancy in my left tube. I honestly don't think there was ever a pregnancy in my uterus though since they only ound normal endometrial tissue in pathology and I never passed big clots at home. I am a nurse, so I totally get that medicine and diagnosis are imperfect, but I do worry a little about the competency of my OBs because multiple docs did ultrasounds before and after my D&amp;C and all thought they saw a pregnancy in my uterus and not in my tubes. I even asked two separate doctors if the pregnancy could be in my tube while they were doing the ultrasounds and they said no. I was told to wait two cycles and start trying again immediately because my endometriosis is only going to continue damaging my body. I had a period a month after my surgery, but that bleeding continued on and off for over a month. I finally had my first normal period on August 31st, but I'm considering it my second cycle since I had the bleeding a month after surgery, even if it was abnormal, so we started trying again this month (to be honest, we didn't use protection a couple times last month, but I had  a normal period afterwards.\n\nNow, I seem to have ovulated (maybe for the first time since surgery?) on my left side 5 days ago. I have been having a pinching pain in my left side for the past 5 days. Has anyone else experienced pain for 5+ days if you ovulate on your ectopic side?\n\nTL; DR In May I had a D&amp;C for presumed miscarriage at 7 weeks and then at 9 weeks had emergency surgery for ectopic pregnancy on the left side. I think I'm ovulating from the left side for the first time this month, and now I've had ovulation pain for 5 days on that side.

In any event, he's benched us from getting pregnant for 2 months, and wants to see me for a follow-up appointment in 3 months.\n\nSo, I understand his reasoning to avoid getting pregnant until the uterus has had time to clear out whatever is left over.  In some ways, I'm OK with this.  It would be nice to have a few months of not fretting over OPKs or HPTs, or worrying about what excuse to give coworkers who want to go out for happy hour drinks.  I certainly wouldn't want to get pregnant while there is still left over tissue in my uterus that would likely compromise the pregnancy anyway and end up pushing back even further when we're given the clear to resume TTC.   But I'm already 35 and feel like the biological clock is *really* ticking.\n\nIn the meantime, I'm going to see my genetic counselor and get the carrier screening and karyotype testing done, and see if she will also order mtfhr testing as well or if that's something I'd need to see another specialist for.  If we're benched for 2 months, may as well be productive and get as many tests out of the way as possible.\n\nOn that note, how would you ladies interpret \"don't get pregnant for 2 months\"?  Meaning wait until the first cycle after Nov 19, or the first ovulation after Nov 19?\n\n**Update:** Just got a call back from the genetic counselor's office.  My insurance requires pre-authorization so they're going to get that going and I should hear back in 10-15 business days on how much (if any) of the tests will be covered by insurance.  Normally I'd be anxious about a 2-3 week wait before we can even begin testing, but given that we're on hold for 2 months anyway, I feel less dismayed.", "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "ttcafterloss", "subreddit_id": "t5_34scd", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Starting MCing 3 weeks ago, saw OB today for follow-up appointment: benched from TTC for 2 months", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/ttcafterloss/comments/713k3v/starting_mcing_3_weeks_ago_saw_ob_today_for/"}, {"author": "mshelbym", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_text": null, "brand_safe": false, "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1505849786, "domain": "self.ttcafterloss", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/ttcafterloss/comments/715i7t/what_are_some_of_your_goto_dos_and_donts_when_ttc/", "id": "715i7t", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "locked": false, "num_comments": 21, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/ttcafterloss/comments/715i7t/what_are_some_of_your_goto_dos_and_donts_when_ttc/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1505931348, "score": 5, "selftext": "Other than the obvious, like prenatals with extra folate, what kind of things do you take, eat, do, don't eat/take/do?

No positives since. It was one of the worst days of my life. The doctors said it was just bad luck, nothing that could be done to prevent it and I'm doing everything right to conceive again.\n\nA week after my miscarriage, this tiny little cat shows up, skin and bones, but suuuuper pregnant. She was scared but so so sweet. Thinking it fate, we took her into my office (apart from our cats) and we let her have her kittens. We got donations and were planning to fix/vaccinate/foster/find homes for all of them, but keep mama and one of the babies to add to the family. The little kittens have pretty much become my life over the past two months, and being under a pile of 6 purring cats has made dealing with bad emotions from the miscarriage so much easier.\n\nEvery day when I work from home, they climb up into my lap and sleep there and purr their little hearts out. They pounce on mama's tail (to her disgust) and love rolling around together. They meow whenever they see people and run over, so excited to be loved on.\n\nI took mama to the vet today to scan her for a microchip in advance of her spay appointment next week, and I was so excited to go ahead and start introducing her to my cats that I went ahead and paid for her FLIV/Feline Leukemia test to be done today during my lunch break.\n\nWhen the vet read the test, he swore and I knew it was bad. Turns out mama kitty has full-blown Feline Leukemia. He said there was a very very high likelihood all 5 kittens have it, too. \n\nIt's basically cat AIDS. They are at very high risk of cancer, and their immune system is basically useless if they get any kind of infection. 70-85% die within 3 years of diagnosis, 25% within 1 year. It is highly contagious so they cannot be let outdoors or around any healthy cats.\n\nThe vet said that until recently, it was always recommended that positive cats be immediately euthanized so they don't have to go through the pain of all the secondary infections they can get. He said that it is rare but possible that they live longer lives, if they are kept indoors 100% of the time and we get lucky. He had one that lived to be 18 -- but he said not to count on it and finding homes for leukemia kitties will be nigh impossible. He said based on that, he personally would probably euthanize all 6 cats. If I did decide to keep them alive, he didn't recommend fixing the mama because there was so big a chance of her getting an infection from it -- if he had a cat under anesthesia already, he'd find it kinder to make sure she never woke up again. If they stayed alive, he said that if one was ever brought into a vet for any kind of illness, the first recommendation would be to euthanize because the prognosis was so grim.\n\nThis morning, all the cats had homes and were so healthy and purring. Now, I have to try to find people so good-hearted (and without other cats) that they would take in cats that probably won't live more than five years. Or, I have to choose to put my visibly healthy babies to sleep.\n\nThere is a very tiny chance one or two of the babies fight off the illness and don't get infected, but the test is at minimum $25/cat and we can't test them for another month or else we'd get false positives/negatives. I can't afford an additional $125 to test all of them in addition to the costs of fixing them all. I don't even know if the spay/neuter clinic I have an appointment at will be willing to do surgery on the kittens if they have the disease, too.\n\nThe vet said that of all the stray cats in the neighborhood he has tested, only 1/10 have had FLIV/leukemia, so unfortunately I just had bad luck with the stray I decided to take in. When I asked what his honest, uncensored recommendation was, he laughed wryly and said to go back in time and not take her in. Sigh.\n\nIt is so fucking unfair. I cried so hard I puked earlier and am taking time off work to try to figure out what to do. \n\nKEEP YOUR CATS VACCINATED, FIXED, AND INDOORS. The vaccine isn't 100% effective, so even if you let your vaccinated cat outside occasionally, you still have the chance that this could happen to you. \n\n\n", "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "ttcafterloss", "subreddit_id": "t5_34scd", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "A rant/Vent: \"Just Bad Luck\"", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/ttcafterloss/comments/71d7jw/a_rantvent_just_bad_luck/"}, {"author": "robotneedslove", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_text": "MMC 5/17 at 11 weeks ", "brand_safe": false, "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1505942540, "domain": "reddit.com", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/ttcafterloss/comments/71ec3f/great_post_on_how_to_stop_fb_baby_ads/", "id": "71ec3f", "is_crosspostable": false, "is_self": false, "is_video": false, "locked": false, "num_comments": 0, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/ttcafterloss/comments/71ec3f/great_post_on_how_to_stop_fb_baby_ads/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1506024402, "score": 1, "selftext": "", "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "ttcafterloss", "subreddit_id": "t5_34scd", "thumbnail": "default", "thumbnail_height": 41, "thumbnail_width": 140, "title": "Great post on How to stop FB baby ads", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/TryingForABaby/comments/71bx3b/tired_of_facebook_inundating_you_with_baby_ads/?ref=share&amp;ref_source=link"}, {"author": "AutoModerator", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_text": null, "brand_safe": false, "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1505977676, "distinguished": "moderator", "domain": "self.ttcafterloss", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/ttcafterloss/comments/71hhgg/ttcafterloss_ttc_daily_discussion_thread/", "id": "71hhgg", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_css_class": "ttc", "link_flair_text": "TTC Thread", "locked": false, "num_comments": 38, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/ttcafterloss/comments/71hhgg/ttcafterloss_ttc_daily_discussion_thread/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1506058086, "score": 1, "selftext": "**This thread is for members who are TTC or waiting to try.
