I started bleeding heavily that evening and it lasted for about 2 days. Did all the research and realized it was a chemical pregnancy. \n\nThis is now just over 2 weeks ago. In normal life I would go to a doctor. But considering I\u2019m now unemployed and without insurance, I figured I\u2019d be fine and to just take it easy at home.\n\nI guess my question is this: is it normal to still be experiencing symptoms? The most obvious one to me is full, sore breasts. I also just feel very bloated and puffy. I\u2019ve definitely been emotional as well, but that\u2019s to be expected after the excitement/terror of becoming a first time mother, during a pandemic no less. But I was not expecting to still feel like this considering it was such an early loss.\n\nIs this anything to be concerned about?

I use to ovulate and have my periods like clock work. I never had to think. I knew my symptoms of both.

I keep toying with myself. Am I strong enough to just stop testing and so smep? Am I strong enough to get through the tww? I know I can\u2019t keep focusing on all these testing methods, it\u2019s so time consuming. I\u2019m making myself crazy wondering what my husbands sperm count is and if it\u2019s normal.

I can\u2019t tell you now what ovulation feels like or what a period feels like, it\u2019s all off and that makes me so very angry. \nI am angry because my loss was in March and I\u2019m 36 and childless, my ob doesn\u2019t want to order testing because I only had one full cycle but I want my baseline.

Should I start with letrozole?**\n\nBefore my third pregnancy I was considering a different doctor because the RE who did my fertility and RPL work-ups (results all normal, minus known PCOS) said she strongly recommended IVF w/ PGS testing and if I wasn't ready for that we could do IUI. It caught me off-guard because I have PCOS and I haven't tried letrozole or ovulation induction meds to strengthen ovulation. We also do not have MFI so doing IUI is really no better than timed intercourse w/ meds for us (based on fertiliyIQ stats), it's just more expensive. During my HSG she also stated I have an arcuate uterus, and this could be an issue but most doctors consider it a natural variation. She stated that I might want to consider having it removed if I had another loss.\n\nThen I got pregnant in March (after ovulating on CD68) and my RE's response was \"Due to COVID and because this is a spontaneous pregnancy, we recommend you seek care with your normal OBGYN.\" They just dropped me as a patient completely. No progesterone testing (known issue w/ PCOS), no betas, no well wishes, nothing. I'm still angry about this, obviously. I proceed to lose pregnancy (MMC diagnosed at first ultrasound at 8+4).\n\nYesterday I called the RE to ask what they recommend for next steps. The RE said after my OBGYN has cleared me w/ a negative HCG blood test, they would like to do a hysteroscopy for arcuate uterus and I should make an appointment at that time. \n\nI'm having a little heartache over this and I don't know if I'm actually being logical or if it's because I'm emotional and desperate to have a child. I figure I have two options to pursue, both potentially resulting in wasted time. \n\n* Option 1: Pursue a second opinion and ask for medicated cycles w/ letrozole + all the things (progesterone, baby aspirin, etc). This makes sense because science says PCOS results in weak ovulation, which is associated with MC. The risk is another MC and several months of time and pursuing hysteroscopy anyways. \n* Option 2: Skip letrozole and have hysteroscopy now. Sit out 1 cycle prior to procedure + 2 cycles after procedure for healing then continue TTC. The evidence on arcuate uteruses being an issue is controversial, and that makes me nervous. The risk here is MC because there is a different cause that was not corrected.\n\nIn my mind, it makes sense to pursue the least invasive option first, right?

She said most people start with blood work and SA before moving to Sonohysterogram and/or Hysteroscopy.\n\nI was thinking uterine scar tissue makes the most sense and I'm currently CD 5, so I scheduled a Sonohysterogram for Tuesday. \n\nI heard back today that its going to be **$800** out of pocket...\n\nNeedless to say, I am not excited about that number.\n\nMy biggest concern is if we *don't* do the procedure and I get pregnant again and I lose a pregnancy AGAIN, I'll be kicking myself over not getting the procedure now and we could have possibly had a healthy pregnancy.\n\nThe risk if I get the procedure now is if they find nothing then we just shelled out $800 when it has probably just been bad luck.\n\nI realize this is just the *beginning* of the costs of infertility. I'm hoping for some advice from all of you experienced ladies (or partners if you're out there). From what you know, would you start with the Sonohysterogram? Start with the blood work and move to Sonohysterogram if blood work is negative? Try for another pregnancy and do the Sonohysterogram if I get a 3rd MC?\n\nThanks in advance!", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "ttcafterloss", "subreddit_id": "t5_34scd", "subreddit_subscribers": 7276, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Could really use some advice on Sonohysterogram and/or Hysteroscopy", "total_awards_received": 0, "treatment_tags": [], "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/ttcafterloss/comments/gkliwu/could_really_use_some_advice_on_sonohysterogram/"}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "EndoMyLifo", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_5wj88nag", "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_premium": false, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1589593427, "domain": "self.ttcafterloss", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/ttcafterloss/comments/gkm7mf/scared_celibate/", "gildings": {}, "id": "gkm7mf", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 6, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/ttcafterloss/comments/gkm7mf/scared_celibate/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1589593434, "score": 1, "selftext": "Me and my fianc\u00e9 lost our baby girl 2 years ago and our sex life is basically non-existent.

My dr explained that it would be pre diabetes if that was a fasting test and I said that I\u2019d eaten breakfast and lunch that day so she said to disregard it. I should also mention that I drank 3 Cosmos the night before the test. I figured I\u2019d lost the baby so I might as well have a few drinks.\n\nAnyway, I haven\u2019t gotten my period back since the surgery so my doctor sent me for bloods. I went a few days ago and was told they did draws for hormones, metabolic, glucose/a1c. I panicked because I started remembering the glucose level from the pre-surgical test.\n\nAll day yesterday I was in a state waiting for the phone call. I finally couldn\u2019t take it anymore and called the office. Needless to say, they didn\u2019t have the results in but the nurse got on the phone with me and tried to calm me down. I was so amped up that I was feeling dizzy and couldn\u2019t breathe. We had to do breathing exercises.\n\nI guess I\u2019m just fixating on the a1c test.

I feel better when I do that but once I\u2019m home the anxiety sets in again.\n\nI\u2019m mad at myself because i feel that if I never emailed my doctor about the glucose she never would have ordered the blood tests. Maybe she would have just ordered the hormone panel since my period hasn\u2019t returned.\n\nPlus every day I am praying for AF and there\u2019s nothing.

I lost the first pregnancy at around eight weeks. It was our first month of trying, before the miscarriage we felt invincible, we knew miscarriage was possible but not that it was probable. I was in a staff meeting when I felt the cramping, went to the bathroom and saw blood, I texted my husband to bring me to the hospital. I waited until the end of the meeting to leave because I didn\u2019t want anyone to know. But people did know. As soon as you become pregnant in the military you are \u201cnon-deployable\u201d, you show up in the readiness statistics, you get a medical profile that keeps you from doing parts of your job, your boss knows immediately. By regulation you can\u2019t hide a medical condition that makes you non-deployable, so there is no waiting until 12 weeks to say anything at work, they already know. The hospital said there was no heartbeat and that I might miscarry. I already had plane tickets to fly home by myself and visit family. I went anyway, I had severe cramping on the flight and ended up hiding in my grandparents bathroom alone to pass the pregnancy. It was terrifyingly painful and lonely. I didn\u2019t tell them. I went to dinner after and drank wine, because why not. The next day I drove to visit my mom who had just got out of surgery, and my sister who was caring for her. I told them, my sister took care of both of us for the next couple days. I had severe cramps for days after.\n\nWhen I got home my husband and I half heartedly tried again when my cycle returned to normal. We were unsuccessful and I got offered a job that would require me to stay deployable. We stopped trying for another 18 months. This past winter we started trying again. On my third cycle we got pregnant, and were cautiously optimistic. I only told my PA and a couple others at work who could help me keep the information quiet. Less than two weeks later I woke up to cramps and blood. Off to the hospital again. I lost the pregnancy that day. My husband was there this time and he was horrified by the pain I was in. It\u2019s taken months for him to consider trying again, to consider me getting hurt like that again.\n\nI went to my OB to discuss testing options, after two miscarriages there must be something they can do. I sobbed as she told me they wouldn\u2019t do anything until I have three miscarriages in a row. I can\u2019t switch OBs, I have to be treated in a military facility. All she would offer is an earlier ultrasound. I tried to research on my own, what could have caused this? I tried to see if my deployments to Iraq and Afghanistan could have contributed, the numerous anthrax shots, the malaria medicine, the burn pits. But there was nothing. There has been no study of miscarriage rates in military women. How is that possible? My annual checkup survey showed mild symptoms of PTSD from the miscarriages. I struggled to make myself walk into the hospital for my follow up HCG tests. I would sob after leaving. I delayed scheduling doctors appointments. \n\nSo now I\u2019m here, waiting and wondering as we prepare for another cross country move. Will I get pregnant again? Will I miscarry 1000 miles into this road trip? Will I be happy if I get pregnant again? Will I ever feel comfortable in the viability of a pregnancy? I\u2019ve told my friends but they\u2019ve all had healthy pregnancies, they are wonderfully sweet and caring but they don\u2019t feel like who I need to talk to. I\u2019ve never met anyone who\u2019s had a miscarriage. My stepsister has announced her pregnancies just days after each of my miscarriages. The first grandchildren.

I\u2019m not really tracking hardcore but I\u2019d like to know a guesstimate of when I\u2019ll ovulate (even though it\u2019s not guaranteed since I don\u2019t know my lunar phase and whatnot). So I\u2019m not sure if I should go off my most recent periods since the loss or just include all of them and average them out. \n\n\nMy period history: \nCycle was used to be anywhere from 27-41 days but usually around 32 (41 was SUPER unusual for me but not uncommon to have like 38 day cycles from time to time) It was never super consistent but not weird enough to call it irregular, I think. Do most women even have rigid 28 day cycles or something though? Mine have always been at LEAST a day or two off every month. \n\nMiscarriages:\nI\u2019ve had two losses - one unplanned pregnancy in 2016 because that ended up being a missed miscarriage. I was on the pill and it didn\u2019t work that month for whatever reason. I thought everything was fine until like 11 weeks at my first ultrasound that it had no heartbeat and the fetus stopped growing at like 7-8 weeks old. I had to have a d&amp;c because my body wouldn\u2019t do the job on its own. That loss hit me super hard because we found out 2 days before our wedding and I expected it to be healthy since I still had pregnancy symptoms, nothing out of the ordinary and was almost in the 2nd trimester. \n\nWe got pregnant again in 2018 this time we *were* trying and I just used this app to track my ovulation days. This pregnancy went well thankfully and I now have a daughter who\u2019s 19 months old. \n\nThen I got accidentally got pregnant again this past November. I found out at like 5 weeks and a week later started bleeding so fortunately I didn\u2019t know long enough for it to really hit me that I was pregnant and so this loss didn\u2019t really affect me as much as my first. \n\nSo now we are trying for baby #2 and I don\u2019t know what the heck is up with my cycle but it\u2019s more dependable than it\u2019s ever been so I\u2019m not complaining \ud83d\ude05", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "ttcafterloss", "subreddit_id": "t5_34scd", "subreddit_subscribers": 7282, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Do I average only the periods after my loss or include every cycle from before?", "total_awards_received": 0, "treatment_tags": [], "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/ttcafterloss/comments/gl5h5l/do_i_average_only_the_periods_after_my_loss_or/"}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "kimmiemarie1", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_2mg8srm9", "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_premium": false, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1589681574, "domain": "self.ttcafterloss", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/ttcafterloss/comments/gl7ajg/whats_your_favorite_baby_making_stuff/", "gildings": {}, "id": "gl7ajg", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_css_class": "question", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_template_id": "64bc0a4e-a73f-11e4-8d5c-22000bc1c25f", "link_flair_text": "Question", "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 13, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/ttcafterloss/comments/gl7ajg/whats_your_favorite_baby_making_stuff/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1589685472, "score": 1, "selftext": "Since my period decided to show up this afternoon I\u2019m going to treat my self to all new stuff what\u2019s everyone\u2019s favorite kits or singles ovulation kits, bbt thermometer, pregnancy test strips anything else you can think of", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "ttcafterloss", "subreddit_id": "t5_34scd", "subreddit_subscribers": 7285, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "What\u2019s your favorite baby making stuff?", "total_awards_received": 0, "treatment_tags": [], "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/ttcafterloss/comments/gl7ajg/whats_your_favorite_baby_making_stuff/"}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "alyssalynn720", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_5n9mrmzi", "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_premium": false, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1589685166, "domain": "self.ttcafterloss", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/ttcafterloss/comments/gl8606/i_hate_that_i_am_feeling_jealous/", "gildings": {}, "id": "gl8606", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_css_class": "vent", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_template_id": "e465bc62-beec-11e4-a607-22000b6b9cb2", "link_flair_text": "Vent", "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 5, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/ttcafterloss/comments/gl8606/i_hate_that_i_am_feeling_jealous/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1589688366, "score": 0, "selftext": "So it was just my kinda luck that I have two friends, who have recently announced they are expecting and their due dates are both of my losses due dates too.

I mentioned this in the daily post, but I wanted to get some advice. I had a MMC at 10 weeks (she measured 8 weeks 4 days) in January. After taking miso at home and passing her, I had to take another round and finally have a D&amp;C to have all POC removed. My SIL got pregnant in August, I think, and was around 6 months when I lost mine. I tried to be supportive before i had success, during, and after, but this loss hit me a lot harder than my 3 previous, I\u2019m assuming because I was further along. I also found out that I have a probable clotting disorder and suspected low progesterone, both of which need to be addressed if i have another success. \n\nSIL went on a cruise, with a low-lying placenta, and not surprisingly had a bleeding episode on the cruise. She spent a week in a hospital near the port they went to where they weren\u2019t sure, for a few hours, that they would both make it. Somehow everything healed perfectly and she was able to have a normal delivery. She was on bed rest for a month or so when she came home, which is the same time I was basically, since I was so weak from all the blood loss, I went from bed, to couch, to bed. SIL got very upset that instead of both my husband and I coming to see her when she arrived back home, only my husband went. Maybe I should have gone too but besides being weak, I didn\u2019t think I could take her going on about how blessed she was to have kept the success. After I heard she was angry about that, I did avoid her for a while since I was also hurt. We had already planned to go to my brother\u2019s house (who lives 4 hours away) for a few days before we found out about our loss, and we kept those plans since I really needed to get away for a while. The trip was rough, but the relaxation was worth it. While I was there, my MIL got wind that I had left, and berated me for taking a trip but not seeing SIL. We were also berated for not cooking meals for them or helping them out financially. Keep in mind that SIL did say something like sorry for your loss but her boyfriend hasn\u2019t spoken about it to us, nor have they offered the services that we were supposed to offer them. \n\nSince then, I have slowly gotten more comfortable with SIL, but every time I am around her, she has to either talk about her success or visually make it well known. It makes me really uncomfortable and I would take leave when it became unbearable. In person, in text and on the phone, she has seemed perfectly fine, but apparently over the months she has gotten angrier and angrier at me for not supporting her. I don\u2019t see how; I went to her shower, I made her two blankets, even handmade other items she\u2019ll need. I asked how everything was when I knew I could emotionally handle it, and in retrospect, I was distant at times because of this. \n\nIt all came to a head when she was induced. My husband went to her house to wish her luck from both of us because, when he decided to go do it, I was in the middle of cooking dinner and they were going to bed soon, so i stayed home. I didn\u2019t say much in our group chat the next day (we\u2019ve had a group chat with MIL, SIL, me and my husband for years now) because I was having a surprisingly hard time dealing with her labor; I didn\u2019t expect it to, but it really blindsided me and i was an emotional wreck. I realized around 3 pm that there hadn\u2019t been any updates and, when i woke up to still no updates, I asked my MIL what was going on. In so many words, she explained that SIL was angry that I didn\u2019t congratulate her and that she had moved the updates to another group chat, cutting me out of it. She then implied that I wasn\u2019t family to her, and that in order to repair the relationship, i would basically have to lick some boots. \n\nThat was two weeks ago. My husband has managed to get SIL to say that there is no excuse for how I acted, and that even her ex husband and his wife brought her gifts when she brought our nephew home and that they wrote both her and her boyfriend heartfelt messages before and after. I feel like this isn\u2019t very fair, since no one else has experienced a loss like this, and MIL actually told me a few months ago that she \u201cgave me the first week\u201d after my loss to pull myself together, but after that, I should have been able to suck it up and be there for SIL. \n\nMy question is this: how on earth can i explain how awful this is in a way they will understand? I have tried asking them to put themselves in my shoes-what if they had the loss instead? I have tried explaining that there were days I didn\u2019t want to eat, or even get up to pee, let alone have a conversation with anyone. The reply, each time, is that there is no excuse for my actions and that I need to apologize for everything. \n\nTL;DR: My in-laws don\u2019t understand why I couldn\u2019t get over my loss in a week and are POed that I didn\u2019t support my SIL more during her success.", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "ttcafterloss", "subreddit_id": "t5_34scd", "subreddit_subscribers": 7285, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "How Can I Explain This To My In-Laws?", "total_awards_received": 0, "treatment_tags": [], "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/ttcafterloss/comments/gm710v/how_can_i_explain_this_to_my_inlaws/"}, {"all_awardings": [], "allow_live_comments": false, "author": "anonxyzk", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_6a1j434q", "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_premium": false, "awarders": [], "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1589837934, "domain": "self.ttcafterloss", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/ttcafterloss/comments/gmav8z/2nd_period_after_mc/", "gildings": {}, "id": "gmav8z", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_css_class": "question", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_template_id": "64bc0a4e-a73f-11e4-8d5c-22000bc1c25f", "link_flair_text": "Question", "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 5, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/ttcafterloss/comments/gmav8z/2nd_period_after_mc/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1589837939, "score": 1, "selftext": "Sorry if this is tmi...my 1st period after my m/c was exactly 1 month after I started bleeding (from my m/c).

Everything seemed to be back to normal according to a scan in early May.  Husband and I started DTD again.  Was hoping for my period to show up last week (around 4w post-op) although knew it could be longer.\n\nHad been testing on and off with HPTs which seemed to have gotten to negative, but last Wednesday I got a shadow.  I had some tiny (as in a few drops on a pantyliner) instances of bleeding on Friday and Sunday which on both occasions I hoped were heralding my period starting, but nothing.\n\nTested again on Monday (different type of test, but same manufacturer and 10mIU sensitivity) and there were now definitely two lines, but much fainter than I would've expected.  I've tested again today with the tests I got the shadow on, and now there's nothing.  I'm not surprised as I've had zero symptoms and things just felt wrong re. the faintness of the lines yesterday.\n\nI'm guessing this was a CP and am just now crossing my fingers that I can expect my period soon.  I'm a bit scared because I've been having some shoulder tip pain which apparently can be a sign of an ectopic, but from my reading this is normally something which happens much later on vs. an early symptom.    \n\nHas anyone experienced this, and how long did it take you to start bleeding?

It\u2019s been a long time since I\u2019ve posted but this question is making me nuts, so here I am. My sincere apologies if I make any forum missteps, as I mentioned I\u2019m out of practice. \n\nLong story long, I have lean PCOS and took myo-inositol supplements much of my first year TTC. At first they seemed to help me ovulate more regularly, and then I just kept at it even though I\u2019m not sure it was helping all that much. I conceived my 2nd round of letrozole (femera) 5mg and kept taking the myo-inositol until 8 weeks, when my midwife advised I stop (although she didn\u2019t know much about the supplement). I learned I\u2019d had a MMC at my 12 week appointment, but development stopped soon after that 8 week appointment (at which point everything seemed normal).\n\nI didn\u2019t resume the myo-inositol when I started TTC again because my RE didn\u2019t know much about it or advise it, and because although I try to fully believe nothing I did caused the MMC, there\u2019s a correlation in my mind because of the timing of stopping the supplement. \n\nHowever, I\u2019ve been taking letrozole - first 5mg, then 7mg - for several cycles now and although I O, no BFPs. I can\u2019t help thinking maybe the myo-inositol was the secret sauce that made it work before, by helping to balance blood sugar/hormones/I don\u2019t know. At close to 2 years TTC, I\u2019m getting a little desperate. My fear is if I restart the inositol and actually conceive again, I\u2019ll have to discontinue it again and be afraid that will \u201ccause\u201d another loss. \n\nIf there\u2019s anyone out there who made it through this post, do you have any thoughts for me at all?

I never had any bleeding or anything prior to the d&amp;c. Post d&amp;c I had very very light spotting on CD1, 2,and 3 and then no bleeding until CD7. On CD7 and CD8 I had bad cramping and bleeding all of a sudden (like a medium/heavy period flow with a small clot) and every time I wiped it looked like small little particles (reminded me of like the little pieces that come off of an eraser after using it). I also noticed these little particles floating around in the toilet. Blood was dark red and then turned dark brown. On CD9 it completely went away. Today is CD 12 and Ive had no bleeding and very very minor cramping.\n\nI\u2019ve been doing Lh, hcg, and bbt tracking since my d&amp;c procedure. \n\n-My hcg tests look like they\u2019re getting lighter and lighter everyday.

Could this mean I ovulated? \n\n(My temp went gone down right after my C&amp;d and remained low until I had a spike on CD9 and then it went back down.

In January, I found out I was pregnant for the very first time. I was nervous, ecstatic, overwhelmed by happiness that this happened to me! For years I was told it never would happen, I had pelvic floor issues and sex was extremely painful because my body eventually put itself into a menopausal state by last August to which I ended up getting vaginal laser treatments for pain. In November my urogynecologist suggested I stopped taking the pill and see what happens. By December 1st, I thought I just got the \u201cwithdrawal\u201d bleed because it takes months to regulate right? My husband and I weren\u2019t trying at all, we knew the doctors said there\u2019s a slim chance if any. But, our little blessing was created. Perfectly. Every single Sunday was her weekly milestone, every test, every doctors appointment. She was perfect. Then around 14 weeks I began having some back pain. By 20, I couldn\u2019t even wash a dish. Doctors said it was normal don\u2019t worry. I emailed and called for advice constantly but maybe it was FTM jitters. On May 6 I had a super quick doctors appointment simply talking about the pain, I thought I was going to be examined. It lasted 5 minutes. The following Wednesday, May 13 around 1:00 I noticed some brown spotting but nothing when I wiped. I called my doctor they said it was normal and only call if it was red or cramps. By 5:30 I began both. By 7:00 I was in active labor and my placenta ruptured. At 8:58, at 23 weeks I delivered my baby girl via emergency c-section. On May 16, she laid in my husband and I\u2019s arms and slept. \n\nThe doctors said things just happen. In a year I could try again. In a year. There was no baby shower, no maternity photos, no nursery we were literally about to purchase everything. I had an anterior placenta so I never got kicks yet, the doctors said by 24 weeks I would have felt them. We will try again but I\u2019m terrified. I\u2019m absolutely terrified. I\u2019m scared now of loss especially my husband. We married on April 16. I\u2019m looking into grief counseling but it helps to connect with others who may be in a familiar place in their life as neither of us have family in VA and no one can really relate.\n\nMy milk has also come in and if anyone has any advice for that (I\u2019ve tried cabbage leaves, a no milk tea by Earth Mama, cold compress) I\u2019m interested! Also, any c-section advice? Please send it, my poor back is in so much pain and I have a awful headache that lingers. I was given Motrin 800 and oxy but I hate the way the oxy feels so I\u2019ve started taking 500mg Tylenol every four hours instead. Sigh just trying to get through this.
