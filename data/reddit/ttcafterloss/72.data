The most helpful part was he told me and my husband to take CoenzymeQ10 300 mg a day, and my husband to take L-carnitine and Acetyl-L-carnitine. Although the SA was fine, the thought these supplements would only help. He also talked a lot about clomid and recommended I test my progesterone at day 21 of my cycle. I called by normal oby/gyn and asked for this test and thankfully she put the order through. I\u2019ll take that test next week.

It was  a week early as I'd had some brown discharge the day before so an emergency scan at 11 weeks. I knew something was wrong as soon as I saw the screen. After an ultrasound and a transvaginal ultrasound I finally made them tell me what they saw. No one  was saying anything and I knew something was wrong. No fetal pole, no development. They ushered us into a side room with a box of children's toys in the corner. They left us to cry for a while and then came in to discuss 'options'. They couldn't offer me surgery for a week and I couldn't handle being 'pregnant' for that time. I had to opt for a 'medically assisted' miscarriage.\nI took a tablet and went home. \n\nThe next day I went back in for the pessary. They'd told me the day before it would be 'horrific', and 'like labour without the happy ending' but this time they just said it would be like a bad period. As I'd been having twinges they sent me home to do the pessary myself. We stopped at the supermarket to stock up on supplies. Pain killers, bowl in case of vomiting, heat pads, towels, huge incontinence pads, cleaning products. My husband joked that it looked like we were going to get rid of a body. I said, we are.\n\nI did the pessary myself, four tablets in the end of a tampon. I was told to keep the tampon in for three hours and then it should start. That didn't happen. Within half an hour I felt a gush. That was the beginning of the worst night of my life. I rushed to the loo and saw it had started. My husband sat with me. To begin win it wasn't too bad, cramping and lots of blood but it was manageable. Then the blood started to come faster, it sounded like someone had left a tap on.  Then 'chunks'. It wasn't as painful as I thought it would be and I was pleased I was managing. By four hours my husband started to get concerned, he asked me if it shouldn't be easing by now. Instead it got worse. By five hours he phoned am ambulance. By this time I had hit the limit if my energy, I had lost more blood than I knew I had in me and was passing chunks half the size of my first. After another hour I started to cry and felt very light headed. He phoned the ambulance again and they told us I wasn't a priority and they had no resources to despatch. I knew the ambulance wasn't coming.\n\nThe ambulance arrived after two hours,  by this time I had been miscarrying on the toilet for seven hours. I was vomiting, cold, shaking, sweating and I couldn't breathe. I started to pass out. It was at this point I felt I was going to die. When they got to me I was half conscious, I couldn't breathe, my heart rate was at 155 and my.bloid pressure had dropped to 60/40. It took them half an hour to find a vein. I managed to tell my husband I loved him as I felt myself slipping away, it felt like fading and being pulled under at the same time  \n\nEventually  they managed to get a vein, they oxygen masked me, tied me to a carry chair and got me in the ambulance. I was pumped full of fluid, morphine and antisickness medication. At hospital they got me stabilised. I was kept in for three days and released yesterday. Apparently I hemorrhaged, and was slipping into stage four hypovolemic shock when they reached me. In essence my body was shutting down from blood loss and I was dying. I'm lucky to be alive.\n\nToday I am struggling. I am angry. I am sad. More than sad. I feel dismissed. I can't believe they make you do that at home. I feel scared as I am still in pain. I have been sent home with anti sickness medication, pain killers, antibiotics in case of infection, iron tablets as I am anemic due to blood loss and calorie supplement drinks as I am unable to eat. People keep wishing me well but I want to scream at them to leave me, that they can't possibly understand the pain. At the same time I want to grab them and never let go. I want to cry an ocean, but I also want to feel nothing. I keep bursting info tears. I want people to know how close I came to death, how I felt it touch me, as no one seems to understand how lucky I am to be alive, but I also can't tell them, I don't want to worry them. Mostly I think I want validation that what I have been through was as bad as it was, that I'm not weak for feeling broken, that I'm not weak for feeling scared. I don't know what I'm looking for in posting this here. I don't know how to move forward. I don't know why physically I'm still in so much pain. And I don't know how to cope with the pain emotionally. I don't know how I am supposed to carry on, but I am.", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "ttcafterloss", "subreddit_id": "t5_34scd", "subreddit_subscribers": 4695, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Traumatic Miscarriage: How to grieve.

So, I have no indication that anything is wrong.  Just wondering if anyone else has been recommended to do a hysteroscopy in these circumstances, and whether you thought it was worth while.

I was finally 6 week pregnant after five months of TTC our second. I had already been feeling the weight of five negative tests in a row after having such an easy time conceiving and carrying our first. When this pregnancy test finally came out positive I was elated...for about two weeks. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI miscarried naturally; they said it was probably chromosomal. I went through a grieving process and tried to move forward so that we could continue TTC since my doctor said that I could keep trying as soon as the ovulation kits hit a positive LH surge, which happened right at the end of the month. By then, I was just so happy to see that stupid little smiley face that I plunged into trying with so much excitement. We had already been having sex again and I was handling it emotionally so I just figured \"Here we go!\". \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI was honestly surprised how calm I was able to remain for the nine day period to be able to take an early pregnancy test. After setting the test up I left the room and kept telling myself that if it didn't happen that it was okay. That this was a long shot - the doctor had even told me so. That maybe the ovulation test had been incorrect due to left over hormones...basically any reason I could muster to brace myself for a negative result. After the three minutes I went in to look and found the negative. I handled it okay, went on with my day. When I told my husband a few hours later it hurt a little to say out loud. Then later after dinner I mentioned something to my mom in passing and felt a deeper sting. By the time Saturday night rolled around I was really upset, crying in bed. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI tried to explain to my husband that I was upset about the negative test. About how I had considered that I could have been 10 weeks pregnant already, about how five months of trying had worn me down little by little... He asked what he could do and all I could reply with was \"I don't know\" because I honestly don't. I couldn't think of anything that would have made me feel better in that moment. After hearing my answer he held me for about two minutes while I cried and then rolled onto his back to surf his phone before trying to go to sleep. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe next day I was still upset. He felt like I was distracted while watching our LO and that I was moody and short with him when I got frustrated over small things like LO dumping the dog's water. Long story short, we got in a fight. I had my mom take LO for dinner so we could talk/have it out without him being around. DH doesn't understand why I'm still upset about the miscarriage, or how a negative pregnancy test could bring the memories of it all rushing back. He told me that he was not mad that I was upset/sad, but mad about how I acted because of it referencing the distracted parenting and mood. We argued some more about the same topic and then he told me that if this was how every month that we don't conceive is going to be that he's done, we aren't going to TTC anymore. That he doesn't want it this way because it's clearly too hard. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOur argument ended with me saying I would watch LO more closely and find another outlet to talk about my feelings since I didn't feel like I could talk to him about them. He was so supportive while I was miscarrying and the week of bleeding after. He would listen to me, talk with me, let me make decisions about telling anyone based on how comfortable I was. As soon as we told our parents I mentioned that I felt like I was ready to move forward and now I feel like I sealed my fate with that statement. He is such a logical thinker and seems like doesn't feel like he lost anything since it was so early...too early...since it was chromosomal and couldn't sustain life.  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm lost and feel alone. Just need someone to listen...

We've had 3 pregnancies in that time and 2 miscarriages (and 1 'chemical pregnancy'). All over the past 12 months.\n\nThe first miscarriage almost destroyed me. It happened at 11 weeks and was very traumatic as I lost a lot of blood after taking oral Misoprostol and being sent home.\nI bled for a month following before being finally diagnosed with retained products of conception and endometritis (infection of the uterus due to the products).\nThe D&amp;C took place 8 weeks after the original diagnosis of miscarriage, so the entire ordeal felt like it was never ending.\n\nIt took months before I had a normal cycle again and we went to an IVF clinic for some help. I got pregnant again on my assessment cycle but lost that baby on Christmas Eve (at 8 weeks).\n\nI don't really know what to say about my state of mind and grief during this time. I put on loads of weight, going up to 106kg. I am also studying to be a doctor and had to endure a 12 week placement in Obstetrics &amp; gynecology in between the 2 miscarriages.\n\nI had to counsel women who were miscarrying. I had to measure and perform tests on women who were due the same week I had been.\nI helped carry out voluntary termination of pregnancies while desperately wanting a baby of my own. I felt ashamed at how I judged those women as I firmly believe in women's right to have reproductive choices. But I just wanted a baby.\n\nI worked in a low income area hospital where neonates were left without visits from Mum or Dad for days at a time.

I recently FOI\u2019ed my medical records from around the time of my first miscarriage. \n\nI had a MMC in May 2017. I went to an appointment with my midwife thinking I was 19w3d along in a pleasant and uneventful pregnancy. My midwife couldn\u2019t find the baby\u2019s heartbeat with the Doppler - a heartbeat I had heard roughly 5.5 weeks before. \n\nI get an emergency ultrasound appointment for later that day and the doctor confirms, no fetal heartbeat. This was over 1.5 years ago and some days the heartache feels the same as it did the day we found out. \n\nAnyway, I had a D&amp;C two days later and a series of follow up tests and appointments. The problem is that I really don\u2019t recall what was said during these meetings. I recall one doctor letting it slip that our baby was a girl, and that there was nothing to indicate I would have similar issues going forward. \n\nWe\u2019ve been actively trying to conceive since June 2018 and after a CP after Cycle 1, we\u2019ve had no success in getting pregnant again. \n\nI decided to request my medical records through Freedom of Information for more information (we recently got referred to a fertility specialist but here in Canada, that can take some time getting an appointment). \n\nI\u2019ve received two records so far - one from the emergency ultrasound and the second from the detailed ultrasound we attended the very next day. \n\nBoth say, \u201cintrauterine fetal demise with fetal hydrops\u201d. I promise when I say this is the first time I have heard that word in my life, especially related to our MMC. \n\nSorry for the novel and I thank you if you made it to the end of this post. Do you know what that means? Does it mean anything? Why would this not have been told to me by any of the doctors we met?

She walks until she reaches a tributary, it's voice the falling of a thousand past tears. She follows it until they, the steam and her, reach the shores of an ocean, vast and open. It stretches, deep, far beyond the limits of her vision. On its edge, a small wooden boat, just big enough for one. She knows this boat is hers and that in it she will cross this ocean, there is no other thing for her to do. She steps from sand, to warm wood, feeling the boat settle under her. She takes a long, last look at the shore of the barren land she traversed, at the stream of tears that lead her here. She looks out at the water stretching before her. There are no maps or logs, no compass for this journey, and there are no records of the shape or end of this sea. There are no landmarks for her to look for,\u00a0 no visible edges or crouching landfall on the horizon. She must cross this expanse, a lone explorer, and forge the way herself. She hears the wind scudding over the water, picking up little waves, and in it the voices of the thousands who have made this journey before her. She hears their weeping, their rage, she listens to the begging and despair, she knows it will stay with her as she travels, but she is not afraid. She knows that her voice has joined them now, that the wind will push her on, will fill the sails of her little boat when she can row no more. She will follow in the wake of all those who have crossed before her. Above her, through the passing clouds, she sees the glittering of stars, their light small become in the darkness. They offer hope, and direction. She gives a sigh, a grounding breathe of air, wipes the tears that track down her cheeks.

I cheered myself for being able to talk with my super unprofessional coworker who is due in 5 weeks with her third. I handled non-stop baby talks, complaining about potty training and complaining about the cost of kids non-stop. I handled the cone that reserved parking spots for all of the pregnant women, starting the day of my D&amp;C. I've finally come to terms with everything. Then, in the teacher's lounge one of the visiting principals came in, and was visibly pregnant. When asked her due date, it was my date. She bonded with the women in the room about being ill and the symptoms that tipped her off to her pregnancy. She was beaming. I didn't even feel jealous or upset about her pregnancy, because I'm finally at the point where I don't resent the happiness of others. I was upset because I wasn't brave enough to bring up my pregnancy and how I knew I was pregnant. I wanted to tell the story of how at 10 weeks I had waves of nausea and quietly moved the garbage can into the hallway so no one would know I was pregnant (didn't throw up). I wanted that bonding experience with everyone. I just didn't want to make her happy moment about my sad moment. If I had shared, it would have become all about me. I don't really know what I'm hoping for by sharing this story, I just really needed to share it with people who would understand.

I'm 1-2 days from an expected period, so I took one again today. Nothing, a clear negative.\n\nLogically, I know it's normal and okay to not be pregnant right after our loss. My body is still doing it's thing and it just wasn't biologically meant to be.\n\nBut I still wanted it to work out. I still anxiously awaited the results both times, and damn if I didn't have a tiny hope my V-Day gift to my husband might be \"you're a dad-to-be!\" Ridiculous as that may sound, the thought still was there.\n\nSo I held it together until after the workday where I came home and wept for a bit just to get the frustration, anger and grief out.\n\nIt's exhausting to be back on \"how do we get pregnant\" schedule.

I'm just not really sure how to feel.\n\nI love my fh. His support is unwavering, he is just all around an incredible man. We discussed kids almost as soon as we got together two years ago.\n\nLast year, we sat down and had a long talk about everything and had a plan. Once we get married, it's free game. We will pull the goalie and whatever happens happens. \n\nWell, after a 45 cycle that ended with a bfn, we had kind of gotten excited. At this point I had been off hbc for five or six months. We had another long talk, and he decided that he wanted to go ahead and start trying. Said that there was no difference whether it was now or in the next year, and we both agreed that just in case it took a bit, this was a good plan.\n\nWe concieved in cycle 5, but it ended with a loss at 6 weeks at the end of January. \n\nSo it's been a few weeks, and I'm ready to face things head on. Let's get back to trying, at least sort of timing sex around my fw. I decided not to start temping again yet. \n\nWe are laying in bed and once I started noticing ewcm, I asked him if he was ready to move forward. Told him if not, that's fine, but I need to know so that way we can use protection. He kind of.. Idk. He answered my question with a question and we moved away so I didn't get an exact answer. I didn't think much of it. \n\nWell, we didnt use protection and pretty sure we hit O-3, O-2, and O/O+1 (weird time of day lol).\n\nWell, in a turn of events I realize I'm kind of spiraling downward emotionally. He has been working nights this week, and I work 8-5 so I've hardly seen him at all other than sleeping together for a couple of hours. \n\nI set an alarm for this morning so I could be awake we he got home so we could talk. I just wanted him to tell me that he loves me and reassure me that everything is okay. I miss my best friend.\n\nSo, you still love me right?\n-Of course.\nYou still wanna put up with my shit for the next fifty years?\n- *shakes head violently and starts laughing*\nYou still wanna start a family with me, right?\n\nFucking hesitation. Within about a half second he shakes his head and smiles.\n\nNo. \n\nSo I point out that he hesitated and asked him what was up. \n\nHe tells me that basically he is for sure he wants to some day, but \"if I could wait a few more months, I would\". Apparently he now has changed his mind and wants to travel and live his life stress free with me for a while after we get married since he hasn't been on a real vacation since he was 22. He is 30. \n\nOf course I understand, but I pointed all of this out in the first place. I told him that I didn't want a baby if he didn't, because this is the rest of our lives. I never wanted him to resent me or our kids because he had big dreams that he never brought to reality.\n\nPart of me thinks it's just part of his grieving process. He was really excited when we found out I was pregnant and I think the whole thing kind of hit him like a freight train when I miscarried. \n\nRegardless, WHY DIDNT YOU TELL ME YOU WERENT SURE. WHY DID I HAVE TO FUCKING PRY TO GET AN ANSWER ABOUT SOMETHING SO IMPORTANT.\n\nHe said he was going to tell me, he just didn't want to upset me or disappoint me and that it's only been a couple days since he started feeling this way.\n\nAnd now, for the first time ever, I just want to see AF.\n\nIt's not that I don't want this. God dammit do I want this. But we have some shit to sort out now and since we keep pushing our wedding back, I'm probably looking at waiting until at least 2020 if this isn't just a phase of grief or something that passes. \n\nI just don't get it. I mean I do. I want to experience things with him too, and I understand its important to do so. I just don't understand how someone who was so excited about being a dad and starting a family can just change his mind, I guess. This is what I thought I was avoiding when I reiterated so many times that if this isn't what he wants, than neither do I. \n\nI don't know. I told him kids are forever. So if I had carried to term, what then? \n\nEither way, this is going to be a long process because I'm going to have a hard time trusting him moving forward. He has to decide when traveling is enough, when he has seen and done enough and I can't decide that for him. If he comes back in two months and says he wants to try again, how do I know he means it??\n\nI mean I thought I was pretty fucking clear the first time but whatever.\nIf you made it this far, thanks for listening. \n\nIf you have any ideas or thoughts feel free to leave them.

(On mobile)\n\nA little background, it\u2019s been 10 months since I lost my daughter at full term to a car accident. \n\n\nI am getting my IUD removed Friday, which is officially 10 months after she was born. (I\u2019m always looking for signs from my daughter who was born on the 22nd. Obviously I just went with first available.) I do believe my moods are worse when I\u2019m having such long cycles. One was 53 days and I hated everything, but also child loss is unspeakably the worst thing ever, so it\u2019s hard to tell where the everything sucks comes from.\n\n\nRecently we have been talking about when the right time is to start trying again. We\u2019ve been cleared for a little while. He knows I\u2019m getting the IUD removed for hormonal reasons and supports it, and also my wanting to try later this year for a 2020 baby. (He knows about tracking now etc) We are taking our time to grieve also, but finally I have the feeling that my baby in heaven wants me to be happy and to feel better. I\u2019m mid 30s, he\u2019s late 30s. And I want to get this done now. I didn\u2019t want to be that much older and pregnant, and then an \u201colder\u201d new mom. I hate that term. We basically agree on 2020, but he is nervous that pregnancy hormones can make my moods worse. And he\u2019s cautious/scared about a loss but doesn\u2019t realize I\u2019m going to be waiting until after seeing the OB to tell him. \n\nSo now I just found out that one of my parents might be very sick (again) and now I\u2019m terrified of losing them too. This came out of nowhere. I want them to be able to hold one of my children so badly, as family only had access to my daughter\u2019s little hands and feet in the NICU crib. (her Dad and I were the only ones to hold her the last day.) All I can think about is how this is another sign it\u2019s time to actually try again. Like a nudge of a reminder how short life is. \n\nI know this is not the same as people moving up their engagements/weddings so grandparents can attend, but I feel like this has changed things and I don\u2019t know how to process it. I can not believe they could be sick again. I\u2019ll know before my daughter\u2019s first birthday if it\u2019s what the doctors think it might be. \n\n\nThis is only really changing by a few months IF it happens right away, but I can\u2019t help but feel scared 2020 could be too late, and to talk to him about actually start NTNP now, which could be a baby this year then. \n\nAny advice or same situations appreciated. \u2665\ufe0f\ud83d\udc7c\ud83c\udffb\n\n", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "ttcafterloss", "subreddit_id": "t5_34scd", "subreddit_subscribers": 4721, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "TTC, sick family etc.", "updated_utc": 1553212046, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/ttcafterloss/comments/as3ujn/ttc_sick_family_etc/"}, {"author": "envidiara", "author_flair_background_color": "", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_template_id": "8b677c92-711f-11e4-b63c-12313b0b807d", "author_flair_text": "TTC # 1, MMC May 2018", "author_flair_text_color": "dark", "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_obqxhp0", "author_patreon_flair": false, "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1550537242, "domain": "self.ttcafterloss", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/ttcafterloss/comments/as4ceh/at_what_point_do_you_confirm_that_yes_you_must_be/", "gildings": {"gid_1": 0, "gid_2": 0, "gid_3": 0}, "id": "as4ceh", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_meta": false, "is_original_content": false, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_robot_indexable": true, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "link_flair_background_color": "", "link_flair_css_class": "trigger", "link_flair_richtext": [], "link_flair_template_id": "7465d7b8-7120-11e4-9568-12313d14791d", "link_flair_text": "Trigger Warning", "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "link_flair_type": "text", "locked": false, "media_only": false, "no_follow": true, "num_comments": 1, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/ttcafterloss/comments/as4ceh/at_what_point_do_you_confirm_that_yes_you_must_be/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1550537243, "score": 2, "selftext": "This isn\u2019t my first rodeo, I\u2019ve had a MC last year in May. In that case, I started bleeding at the 6 week mark. Was told I had an SCH but there was a heartbeat. Next week I came in for more bleeding, and there was no heartbeat. \n\nI am feeling major PTSD this time around when I started bleeding again at the 6 week mark. On Friday, it was confirmed that it was not ectopic but too early to see a heartbeat/yet the yolk sac measured on time. The bleeding has been increasing since that visit. The nurse line told me to go to the ER but I am kind of avoiding it based on fear. I feel like this is already the end. This is exactly how it went with my last MC in terms of blood. So do you just wait and see? Come to terms that this is probably a MC? I feel like what can they do at the ER other than tell me to monitor. I guess I could confirm for sure what\u2019s going on. I\u2019m so lost and can\u2019t believe I\u2019m going thru this again. Now the fears of am I ever going to carry a pregnancy to term...we also had a rough time after the last MC and trying to get pregnant again. \n\n\ud83d\ude3f\n\n", "send_replies": true, "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "ttcafterloss", "subreddit_id": "t5_34scd", "subreddit_subscribers": 4720, "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "At what point do you confirm that yes, you must be miscarrying again?
