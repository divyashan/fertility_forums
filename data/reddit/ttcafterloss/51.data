A little background: we have been TTC for several years. I had taken a sperm analysis and was told that potentially due to my weight, I have some motility problems. I have been grappling with losing weight for years and I am a type I diabetic.\n\nMy birthday was this passed September. I wished for a baby. That is what I and my wife want more than anything. The next day, my wife had to work late and during dinner she mentioned that she was having some bad stomach cramps. She had to go back into work for an evening meeting but she texted me shortly after arriving and asked if I would get her. Something wasn't right.\n\nAbout an hour later after picking her up and being at home, I convinced her that she needed to go to the emergency room as she was having a lot of vaginal bleeding. She had thought, her period started a few days before, but she had never experienced bleeding like this.  It turns out, she was having a miscarriage. Because of the remote possibility of getting pregnant, and because her period had only been a week or two late (which happens on occasion) she hadn't really considered the possibility of being pregnant. I learned later that for my birthday, she had considered taking a pregnancy test, but didn't want to be disappointed (again). I am glad she didn't. Not knowing she was pregnant and her having the miscarriage was tough, but having known, for one day, on my birthday, and then having a miscarriage would have been even more devastating.\n\nFast forward to now. The holidays have been tough for me. My wife got me thinking when she mentioned \"isn't it hard to believe that we could have been buying clothes and baby stuff?\" Now, commercials with kids being excited for Christmas, talking about creating Christmas traditions with kids, thinking about how we could have been preparing for a baby in the next year has me really bummed out lately.\n\nI know its terrible, but when my friends or even family are excited about their upcoming due dates, or their kid's Christmas, I want to just be a damn grinch about it.  It isn't their fault, but it makes me so sad and bummed out. \n\nChristmas is our favorite time of year and I want so much to be able to create and continue traditions with my children, but I cannot, because we haven't been able to have any, and the only one we were able to conceive, left us.\n\nThe holidays are exciting, and I am trying to be positive, but I will admit, this year has been a little tough this year. We are still trying, but the fear and sadness I have isn't just for the one we lost, but also, what if we never get to create a baby again?", "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "ttcafterloss", "subreddit_id": "t5_34scd", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "The Holidays Have Been Tough", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/ttcafterloss/comments/7ge3m9/the_holidays_have_been_tough/"}, {"author": "Louise_fire", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_text": null, "brand_safe": false, "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1511971389, "domain": "self.ttcafterloss", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/ttcafterloss/comments/7geb1c/so_hard/", "id": "7geb1c", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "locked": false, "num_comments": 10, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/ttcafterloss/comments/7geb1c/so_hard/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1512042565, "score": 12, "selftext": "Sitting there in the doctors surgery watching you holding your new born baby, I swallowed that lump in my throat and thought back the tears...they same time helps but it never does.\n\nYour little one was crying and hunting for food, you turned to look at me and apologised and I smiled...I told you that you were doing great and had nothing to apologise for...what you said next nearly destroyed me, for you didn't say anything good or how much you enjoyed having a little one, the look in your eyes changed and you said with all the meaning in the world that you wish you had never had another child, how were you to cope with 5 more kids at home and your partner wasn't around...you also warned me...don't have children, the worst mistake of your life! \n\nI...I...had no words to say, I just went back to reading my magazine even though I'm pretty sure I was only reading the one sentence over and over again. \n\nYou see I should have been sitting there holding my baby, my beautiful baby who would have been 15weeks old.

I also was finally released from my weekly/biweekly blood draws after HCG was down to 6 on Monday.\n\nThat was one of the worst experiences in my admittedly pretty lucky life so far. We couldn't have sex for 2 months due to all the bleeding. I was scared to go out in public for weeks because I would bleed intermittently (in gushes) with no warning.

On Sunday, officially 16 weeks, I came home from my mothers for Thanksgiving. I had had a great few days off work and there was no fighting or arguing, a first at my house during the holidays.  I was so excited to come home because I had a full week of appointments and on Wednesday I was supposed to find out if our baby was a he or a she.\nI got home around 3:30 pm and just went about my business. Around 4:30 I felt something go wrong and my water broke. It was one of the worst and scariest moments of my life. My husband drove me to the ER where I was diagnosis\u2019s with PPROM ( preterm premature rupture of membranes) and threatened miscarriage. I was given an ultrasound where I found out my baby was still moving and had a heart beat of 170. My baby was still alive but there was very little amniotic fluid. I was told that basically there was nothing they could do. I had antibiotics and went home. \nI followed up with my OB on Monday where I found out my baby no longer had a heartbeat and I had no amniotic fluid at all. I was told that Mother Nature could take days to a week to run its course and my risk for infection was too high to wait it out. I was booked in to L&amp;D that afternoon. The walk to that room past all the mothers waiting to meet their babies with smiles and families was one of the most painful walks of my life. I was set up in my room given fluids, an IV and a dose of misoprostol. I was told by my OB it could take up to 5 or 6 doses for my body to get with the program but I could have whatever pain medication that I wanted when I felt I needed it. Thankfully it didn\u2019t take that long. I got my second dose of Miso at 11 pm and by 1:30 am on Tuesday the contractions became very painful and I ended up taking some pain medication. \nAt 2:16 am I gave birth to my Son, Daniel, on 11/28/17. He weighed 97 grams and was perfect. 10 fingers. 10 toes. He was everything I ever wanted. The rest of my experience went pretty smooth. I didn\u2019t hemmorage or require a D&amp;C for which I am forever grateful. But I walked out of that ward with empty arms and a broken heart. I have never felt so sad or so empty in my entire life. I feel like I will never be happy again. I know I will try again as soon as my doctor says it is safe but in the mean time I just feel lost and without purpose. I had all these plans and dreams and now I feel just grief. My husband and family is very supportive and my workplace is great. My husband is also able to be home with me and we both have time to grieve but I don\u2019t think there will ever be enough time.

CP in early October. First cycle after CP was a few days longer and then very normal after that.\n\nI'm beginning to suspect I never actually ovulated in November. CD 1 was November 1. LH Surge with OPK detected November 12. I had ALL of the progesterone symptoms for about a week. Started very faint spotting and had slight twingey feelings very early. Period was one day late and showed up in the middle of the night which is odd. Flow was heavier than usual for the first day (usually, my cycle is light on day 1, then medium on day 2, then light day 3, then spotting). Cramps were milder than usual and gone before the end of the day (cramps usually last until CD 2).\n\nToday is CD 2, flow is light, and I am beginning to notice more symptoms similar to ovulation. I used an OPK and it was a faint line similar to the days leading up the ovulation, which could be due to low levels of LH always being present. I'm going to keep testing OPK and monitor for more ovulation symptoms this week.\n\nI was really, really stressed in November. I have experienced delayed ovulation due to stress before but have never detected an anovulatory cycle (that I know of).

This is a *very* detailed account of my experience, partially because it\u2019s cathartic to me, and partially because I hope it can help someone else out who is worried about going through it. You\u2019re not alone. I don\u2019t go too much into my mental and emotional struggles here because I\u2019m still processing it.\n\n**Loss:** \n\nTwo days before Thanksgiving, I went into full blown panic attack mode because all my symptoms had disappeared for about 4 days. I could go 5 hours without eating no problem, my nausea was gone, and I was sleeping just fine. The nurse basically told me nothing they can do if I wasn\u2019t bleeding, so I ended up scheduling a private scan for reassurance that afternoon thinking that would knock my silly anxiety down and I could go about my holiday. But then...the technician said she couldn't find the heartbeat. And if she had to guess I was measuring around 8 weeks. I was supposed to be 9+4. She mentioned it could have just been the position of the embryo, but considering we saw a heartbeat with abdominal scan at 7+2 just a couple weeks before, I was doubtful and my heart sank.\n\nThey didn't have a transvaginal transducer there, so I scheduled an appointment with a doc the following morning to confirm whether the pregnancy was still viable. I went into work that morning, accomplished almost nothing, and then went into my appointment with DH. The doctor confirmed that there was no heartbeat, and that the baby was measuring just a hair over 7 weeks. We discussed our options, but I knew going in that I wanted to try to avoid surgery if possible, but I also didn\u2019t want to wait for it to happen naturally. We opted for the misoprostol. We cancelled our Thanksgiving flights and told our families (they knew about the pregnancy), got a prescription for the misoprostol to induce the passing, oxycodone for pain, and proclorperazine for nausea. \n\n**Misoprostol:**  \n\nWe armed ourselves with everything we needed \u2013 heavy duty pads, water bottles, comfort foods, board games, movies, and settled in for the worst. On Thanksgiving morning, DH and I made chocolate chip pancakes, I took ibuprofen and the anti-nausea meds, and about 30 minutes later put 800 mg of misprostol in my cheeks to dissolve per the instructions. About 30 minutes later, I rinsed down the remaining fragments and waited. I felt pretty sleepy (I think it was the anti-nausea meds) and laid down for a 3 hour nap). I had a little bit of cramping, but my cervix still felt high and firm that night, so I called the OB on call. They told me to fill the refill and try again the next morning.  \n\nOn Friday morning, I went through the routine again \u2013 ibuprofen and anti-nausea meds, followed by misoprostol in the same way 30 minutes later. This time I left them in for about 90 minutes until they were fully dissolved. By about 4 pm that afternoon, I had some light spotting, but nothing heavy. The spotting continued on Saturday, so I called the OB on call again. They agreed that it sounded like the misprostol had not worked. They told me to call on Monday to schedule an appointment with a particular doctor who was very good with the D&amp;C procedures. That day, I got my hair cut, eyebrows threaded, and went to the library, walking about 5-6 miles in the process. It felt good to get out and feel like a normal person, but I was disappointed that all of the walking didn\u2019t move things along.  \n\nOn the following Wednesday (1 week, 1 day after we first found out about the MMC), I met with the doctor to discuss and schedule the D&amp;C. She did a quick transvaginal scan to make sure the pregnancy was still present (it was).  I\u2019m leaving for a work conference on Saturday, so I wanted it done ASAP (combined with the mental anguish of still carrying around a dead baby. I was so ready to put this all behind me). We went over the paperwork, and she told me that I could start trying as soon as I felt ready and after my pelvic rest time was up (2 weeks after the procedure). She did say that they generally suggest waiting until after the first period but that\u2019s primarily because of dating purposes, not any detrimental health reasons. We scheduled the D&amp;C for the next morning.  \n\n\n**D&amp;C:** \n\nI was told no food or fluids after midnight, but an anesthesiologist friend of mine said they usually say that to keep it simple and I could have clear fluids up to two hours before (but no pulp). I had a few sips of water in the morning when I woke up to alleviate my dry throat. I packed some entertainment (book, journal), some snacks and water for post-op and for DH while I was back there, a phone charger, a couple pads, and my phone charger. \n\nDH and I were told to arrive at the surgical unit at 8:30 am. I wore something loose and comfortable (sweat pants, a pajama shirt, and a hoodie). We took public transit in (about a 20 minute ride and 10 minute walk). Once we got there, I had to fill out some paperwork (health care proxy, emergency contacts, agreeing to the procedure, etc.), get my medical bracelet, and we were sent to the waiting room. A nurse came out to check on us and told us I had been scheduled for 12:30 pm, but they were going to see if they had room to fit me in before. I was just about to drink some water, but another nurse said they had an opening and could take me back right away. This was around 9:15 am. \n\nDH was left in the waiting room briefly while they showed me my bed, had me change into my gown (fully nude underneath, open in the back) and non-slip socks. They had me lay down and put some pre-warmed blankets on me (seriously though, need to get myself a blanket warmer for home). They took my blood pressure, put a sensor on my finger to measure O2 and pulse, asked some questions about previous medical history and drug allergies, and brought DH back. The nurse came in and gave me two zithromycin tablets \u2013 she said that they give the antibiotic before the procedure to prevent infection. I took the tablets with two small sips of water. \n\nThe anesthesiologist also came in, asked me some questions about previous responses to anesthesia and medical history, left briefly, and came back in with the IV hookup. He said he usually uses lidocaine to numb the area for any needle 20-guage or above, but he was able to use a smaller 22-guage needle for this. Fortunately, he got the needle placed the first time (I was surprised, my veins can be difficult), removed the needle leaving the cannula inside, and taped it down. They attached me to a saline drip, which I was very grateful for because it didn\u2019t take long for me to stop feeling as parched.  I got a nurse to help me with the IV bag so I could run to the restroom to relieve my bladder before the procedure started.\n\nDH and I waited another 30-40 minutes or so, and the nurse-anesthesiologist came in. She administered some Toradol, which is an IV-administered NSAID like ibuprofen. She said that it would already be in my system by the time I woke up and should help with the pains afterwards. DH was sent back out to the waiting room, and at around 10:15-10:30 am, I walked the 15 feet into the operating room. The doctor I had met with the day before was there, as well as a nurse, a resident, and the nurse-anesthesiologist. They had me lay down, they put a fresh warm blanket on me, and had me scoot forward on the bed (like a pap, bum near the edge of the table). Instead of foot stirrups, my legs were held up by pads that went under my knees which was much more comfortable. The nurse-anesthesiologist said she would administer the Propofol (the anesthetic). In about 10-15 seconds, I got dizzy, and about 5 seconds later, I was out.  \n\nWhile I was out, I think I must have felt some of the cramping because I had a dream that I was in labor with our daughter (we hadn\u2019t confirmed the sex of the baby, but I\u2019ve only ever had dreams that it was a girl). I guess they wheeled me back while I was still asleep because I woke up in the pre-op bed and upon remembering my dream, immediately started bawling. I regained my consciousness pretty quickly at around 11:00 am (so the whole thing was about 30-40 minutes, including the time it took to knock me out and for me to come back to). I commented on my post-op\u2019s nurse fitbit (I have the same one) and mentioned I was cramping pretty badly, so they brought me some Tylenol. I realized while I was out they put me in mesh undies with a pad \u2013 the mesh undies are SO comfy, ladies. I took another pair home for later. \n\nThey offered me food and drink, so I requested water and that DH be brought in because he had a Larabar for me (I have food allergies, so I can\u2019t have most normal snacks like gold fish and chips). We went over the discharge paperwork (don\u2019t drink alcohol for 24 hours, take ibuprofen and Tylenol as needed, pelvic rest for 2 weeks, no heavy exercise, call in if I\u2019m bleeding heavily or get a fever), and they had me urinate in a collection bucket to make sure I wasn\u2019t bleeding too heavily. They removed my IV line (painless, except for the removal of the tape), and some monitors on my upper chest.\n\nI found out from the nurse that I was dilated to 7-8 mm (just under 1 cm) during the procedure, and they used the aspiration apparatus to go all the way to the top of the fundus of the uterus. Most of the cramping I\u2019m feeling, she said, is the result of my uterus contracting back to normal size, but since the baby wasn\u2019t very big, it shouldn\u2019t last long.  I also asked about what pathology might be able to tell me (I was particularly interested in knowing if they could tell me the baby\u2019s sex from pathology, but they said no because there\u2019s not enough tissue and it had already been gone for a while. No guarantee we\u2019ll get any answers. \n\nI was able to get dressed, and they wheeled me down to the main floor around 11:45 am, where DH and I caught an Uber home.  \n\n**Recovery:** \n\nDH and I got home around 12:15 pm, and I was starving, so he ordered us some Pad Thai and we settled in to watch Netflix. I kept getting up because I could feel the blood leaking out of me. I\u2019m definitely bleeding more now than I did directly after the procedure, but a hot water bottle/heating pad has been the best thing ever for the cramping. I didn\u2019t feel like the ibuprofen or Tylenol were doing anything. Still getting a bit of lightning crotch, but otherwise feeling okay. I took a nap, and I\u2019ll likely come back and edit this or make a new post on how my recovery progresses over the next week or so. My temps and resting heart rate have also been pretty wonky, so I\u2019ll be sure to update those as well.  \n\nThanks for reading, and kudos if you made it through the whole thing &lt;3. \n", "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "ttcafterloss", "subreddit_id": "t5_34scd", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "My MMC loss, failed misoprostol, and D&amp;C experience", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/ttcafterloss/comments/7gph9s/my_mmc_loss_failed_misoprostol_and_dc_experience/"}, {"author": "Metsgal", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_text": null, "brand_safe": false, "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1512098208, "domain": "self.ttcafterloss", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/ttcafterloss/comments/7gs52m/i_should_be_giving_birth_this_weekend/", "id": "7gs52m", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "locked": false, "num_comments": 5, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/ttcafterloss/comments/7gs52m/i_should_be_giving_birth_this_weekend/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1512177252, "score": 4, "selftext": "Instead I\u2019m no longer pregnant and crying myself to sleep for the third night in a row. \n\nLast night a client asked me how my baby was because she forgot what happened and assumed if I was there I must have had the baby already. \n\nI just want to hide away with my husband all weekend but his mom has cancer and it\u2019s her birthday tomorrow so we have to spend the weekend with her. \n\nI am having trouble getting pregnant again.\n\nAnd worst of all, I just keep thinking what if I caused this?

I just got my period again for the first time since Sept, I was waiting at least one cycle to try (one gyno said wait 1-2, the other said 2 but then corrected herself to at least 1 and then if it happens it happens). I thought my period would come at the earliest 4 weeks and very possibly later from the D&amp;C, but looks like it's my typical 25 day cycle instead. I conceived last time cycle day 10 or 12 (only days we had sex) so that gives me a looming timeframe. It is sooner than I thought it would be, and I am so nervous.\n\nI want to conceive again right away so badly for the timing and to have some joy again... I am trying not to get my heart too set on it but damn, I want to so badly. But then I know I will be so anxious if it does happen. I was terribly anxious the last time, long before my nightmare came true. I don't know how I will overcome the fear. We have abstained from sex since early Oct for various reasons, I want it to be first and foremost an expression of our love but I guess it could bring a lot of other feelings too, I am nervous about that too.\n\nAs for possible contributing factors to the miscarriage... I am 35, had slightly elevated TSH in blood tests (3.35) indicating slight hypothyroidism in blood tests when the blighted ovum was confirmed... my gyno wants to see 1 for ttc so I've been taking thyroid hormones (T3 I think) since start of Nov. One gyno said low thyroid is more related to trouble conceiving than blighted ovum though, and the internist who saw me today said my thyroid looked small but normal and no one can really say if thyroid hormones can play a role in blighted ovum. But he thought taking T3 would be a good bet for ttc though he didn't consider me really hypo. My progesterone was only 11 but there doesn't seem to be any agreement oit there on if that is a cause or effect as far as blighted ovum... or how that could be connected to thyroid. In any case my gyno doesn't believe in just supplementing progesterone without testing it at another time in my cycle, and she doesn't see that as necessary at this point.\n\nI know there are rarely any answers when it comes to miscarriages. Frankly I don't want there to be an answer, I don't want there to be something wrong with me for them to ppossibly be missing now that could lead to other losses. I just want it to have been garden variety bad luck, and I want my turn at good luck now please. Part of me is so terrified of another loss, possibly even further along (the blighted ovum was bad enough, I don't know how I would endure a miscarriage after seeing a heartbeat, or closer to 20 weeks, or a stillbirth...) There are so many stories of successful pregnancy right after a miscarriage, but what if that's not me? This and related subs have shown me that all kinds of things can happen to good, ostensibly healthy people.\n\nDoes anyone have any words that can help me? I could really use some. Please share your specific experiences if you wish... hormone experiences, how long you thought safe to wait after miscarrying, how you coped with sex, with conceiving right away or not... information helps me a lot... but just plain reassurance is good too.

I had noticed a decrease in breast tenderness and sort of \u2018felt\u2019 something was wrong but no bleeding or cramping. I\u2019m a worrier though so thought my latest scan would ease my fears.\n\nNo heartbeat on Thursday, and given the 3 options. I decided to try the pills at home. Nearly nothing happened. I had some bleeding and passed some large clots but I knew they hadn\u2019t done the trick. No pain or cramps. Dr got me squeezed in for a D&amp;E last night. Uneventful and not having any pain. Dr. said it was right there at my cervix but I never had cramps or an urge to push. Glad it\u2019s done and ready to start TTC in a couple weeks. Hoping to hit my first ovulation but will wait to see what she tells me at my follow up. \n\nI\u2019m sad but I have a sweet little man who keeps me on my toes and no known fertility issues so hoping for another BFP soon. Can\u2019t predict the future but trying to be hopeful. I just turned 35 so I don\u2019t have all the time in the wold but my Dr was very encouraging and believes it will happen quickly.

Trying for 2 years, 1 known/2+possible losses, lurk here a lot, type out comments, then delete because of tears. I need help. Or support.

I tend to start comments and posts, but delete because I can't think clearly. Came here from /r/infertility after our first *known* loss this past June.\n\nObligatory introductions. :) I'm 32, hubs is 33. We've been trying since Aug 2015. Tried seeing a few doctors at the beginning (at my mother's suggestion) to find out if I had the same issues my mom had getting/staying pregnant. I was told I'm \"young and healthy\" and should have no issue getting pregnant despite my abnormal cycles. Possible first loss Dec '15 - All symptoms were there, two weeks later than normal, but no BFP. Sept '16, we contacted a women's health center about seeing an RE. Again, \"young and healthy\" and was assigned a PA that had experience in infertility. Diagnosed Oligomenorrhea/hypothyroid, borderline PCOS, Infertile.  Few rounds of Clomid (only one with confirmed ovulation), one round of Letrozol (made me sick as hell...). HSG on a no treatment cycle in May '17... two weeks later... lo and behold a BFP!! Ahh! Only lasted 6 weeks. Ultrasound to confirm - the little tadpole couldn't implant. Saw my GYN, she cleared me to try again end of July. At that point, we were referred to a fertility clinic. Lots of tests, officially PCOS, levothroxine uped from 25mcg to 50 (with monitoring this time!). First IUI was last cycle, CD31 BFN, spotting showed up CD35. I feel like this was another loss, but we don't know for sure.\n\nTaking this cycle off because hubs is out of town during fertile week. And next, because we'll both be out of town those days for a wedding. Anywho, after two years of disappointment, I don't know how much fight I have left. I'm seriously looking into adoption as our only option, but hubs isn't ready for that yet. I'm so tired of the questions and comments (When are you having a baby?... Are you pregnant yet?...Hiding a baby bump under those babydoll dresses?... You're next!!). I feel terrible knowing that some couples wait YEARS to get pregnant. Or never get to feel that joy. Both run in my family. But then again... so do twins.

In October we found out we were expecting our second. We were elated. I was so insanely sick though, starting at 4-5 weeks I could barely get out of bed. Then on November 6 I started bleeding. We went to the ER where they diagnosed me with a subchorionic hemorrhage. But the baby was perfect. They said take it easy and it will most likely resolve on it's own. The bleeding continued, I had tons of clots, and what I know now to be our baby. I went to a prenatal appointment on November 16, which was uneventful. She reiterated what the ER doc said, ordered labs and another ultrasound. She couldn't hear the heartbeat with the doplar but I was at 9 weeks so she didn't worry about it. They also called a couple days later to say my beta levels were \"kind of low\" so to make sure to schedule a follow up ultrasound. \n\nI had my ultrasound a week later. I knew instantly. The screen was totally empty. The doctor there confirmed that there was no sign of a pregnancy.\n\nI have now gotten a look at my labs from both the ER visit and the prenatal appointment. And here's where I get really pissed. My levels in the ER at 7 weeks +5 were 40,000. My levels 10 days later were 3,500. How on earth is that \"a little low\". The OB office had my ER records. It's all in  the same hospital. She sat and looked at it during the appointment. I know it wouldn't have changed anything but it still infuriates me. I went a week thinking everything was fine. We hosted thanksgiving and talked about the new baby with our family all weekend.\n\nThe OB office called Friday and left a message to get follow up labs done. I honestly don't ever want to go back there. I know I'm not pregnant. I had an ultrasound so we know it's not ectopic. The bleeding is done, it's over. \n\nI've cried and cried. I feel so guilty for flushing my baby down the toilet. I feel guilty for having drinks with diner when I knew I could have been pregnant. I feel guilty for working out so hard after I knew I was pregnant. I feel guilty for not insisting on an ultrasound when we didn't hear a heart and for not prying more about the beta levels. I feel stupid for telling our family so early because now we've had to call and break all their hearts too.\n\nI don't really want to wait to try again. Since I'm not going to go back to the OB I do kind of want to wait for a period for my own peace of mind. Plus we're traveling for Christmas and it will be one less thing to stress about.\n\nIt feels good to get it all out.

I had a Missed MC that was discovered at my first OB appointment at 9+5.  I had a D&amp;C at the hospital this morning.\n\nI was pretty terrified to go to the hospital as I have never been before, but I'm grateful to report that all things considered it was a good experience and pretty easy.  We didn't get much info on what actually happened to the baby- my doctor didn't even tell me how big it was measuring, he just said there was no heartbeat.  But he did say we could try again in a few months.  I'm hoping to get some more information at my follow up appointment in a few weeks, but I know that sometimes there just isn't a discernible reason.\n\nWhile I am grieving the loss of our baby, I'm also grieving the loss of our plans.  I'm 35 years old and this was my first pregnancy (my husband has two grown children from a previous relationship).  I had a weird feeling all along and was reluctant to tell too many people or buy a bunch of baby stuff- I'm grateful for that now.  However I did buy a few small things, and we made plans for big reveals during Christmas.  I am sad that we won't be able to do that.   I'm also a teacher and the timing would have been perfect- I've been considering exploring other options, and I would have been able to easily take a leave from work next year and try some other things.  Now with this loss and having to wait to try again, that whole process will be much more complicated.  With my age, I don't feel like I can waste any more time trying to time it nicely.  I am coming to grips with this being just another lesson in we can't control much of anything- we can plan as much as we want, but things will work out however they are destined to work out, and we are just along for the ride.\n\nSo that's me, working through my grief and planning for the future one day at a time.

I've been meaning to post an update for a while, but between life getting in the way and not knowing what to say, it's taken this long. [Sorry for the wall that you're about to encounter - there is a tl;dr at the bottom]\n\nI think in my last post I left off with on 11/3 my HCG was 294.7. On 11/6 they had me do an ultrasound to check for any remaining tissue that could be causing the HCG increases [I don't think they checked thoroughly for an ectopic at this point because I wasn't having any pain or symptoms associated with, so they were on the thought of just remaining tissue in my uterus] which showed nothing. \n\nOn 11/7 I had another blood draw that came back at 503! My local clinic then referred me to a town 20 minutes away to a gynecologist. At my appointment on 11/9 - he said from what he was seeing with my numbers and because there was nothing on my ultrasound and no symptoms to suggest otherwise, he thought, too, it was remaining 'products of conception' and recommended a D&amp;C.\n\nWe scheduled the D&amp;C for the following day [11/10] [they would have done it same day, but I didn't have a driver with me] - pretty simple procedure, really in the whole grand scheme of things. I was put out for about 25 minutes. Went home a couple hours later &amp; rested, then proceeded to clean half my house the next day. They drew blood that day and told me after the D&amp;C what my numbers were, but I cannot remember and can't seem to find it in my records, it was *just* over 600 though. \n\nOn Monday 11/13 I had my blood drawn again - 629.9. Up, again. The following day [11/14] the nurse from the gyn called &amp; they wanted me to do a urine test to rule out the \"rare, but possible\" false positive. If the urine test was positive, I was going to need another ultrasound. Well, that was positive and off I went to have the 2nd ultrasound where they were specifically looking for an ectopic pregnancy. I knew when it took longer than the first and she kept focusing on my right side, there was something off. I met with the Dr afterwards and he then suggested that based on what they saw [a mass in my right tube] that I would need to have surgery. \n\nI asked about the methotrexate shot. He said that it'd been so long since they used it, he didn't know the dosage, or if the hospital even had it in stock. He said he prefers laparoscopic surgery because then you know it's gone, there is no guarantee with the shot. Makes sense - so I opted for surgery, the next day. He did say that there was a possibility of waiting until the following week, but then we ran the risk of it turning into an emergency situation &amp; that sounds like even less fun!\n\nThe Dr had said that it's with all hope to be able to save the tube, but not always possible. He also called that evening and said that after further information from the ultrasound it showed that my tube was swollen to 3/4in - 1in [normal is the size of a pencil he said].\n\nSo, on 11/15 I quit eating and drinking at midnight, as instructed [well, I guess I had some water at some point after that!] Went to check in at 9:30am I think, for surgery that was supposed to be around 10:30am. I didn't get taken back until 12:50. I was out for 2 hours and then spent another 3 in recovery/post op. When the Dr came out to talk to my grandma after surgery he said he couldn't believe I wasn't in pain for as large and damaged as my tube was! &amp; Because of that, I write this with one less fallopian tube. However, they were able to save my ovary, which I guess is good news. Contrary to what I thought I was taught in 5th grade health, the remaining tube can 'float' to the ovary that doesn't have a tube &amp; could potentially catch an egg that is released from that ovary. \n\nLuckily through all this, instead of having to wait for three to six months to TTC, we only have to wait about 3 cycles! &amp; contrary to what the post op instruction sheet said, we don't have to wait 8 weeks to have sex! [my poor husband through all of this!!!] I got my stitches out on 11/20 &amp; everything outwardly is healing great. I am just now waiting to bleed and start tracking cycles again, hoping that they are 'normal'! \n\nDr said that missing the tube shouldn't cause any issues with future fertility [fingers crossed we don't have a 2nd ectopic!] We'll see I guess. In the meantime, I'm going to drink my way through the holidays. Work on getting me &amp; DH healthier overall. Try to save some money and pay off some debt.... [Maybe I'll read that Dave Ramsey book I bought a few months ago!]  On a super positive note: My brother [step if we're getting specific] got engaged last Friday. Last night he &amp; his fiance came over &amp; she asked me to be a bridesmaid!! Wedding will be in November of next year, I think. So that will give me some good distractions for the next few months &amp; who knows, maybe we'll be lucky &amp; I'll end up being sober for their whole wedding &amp; festivities!! \n\nIf you've made it this far, thank you! If you haven't: \n\ntl;dr - slowly increasing HCG, nothing on first ultrasound. D&amp;C done for remaining tissue, HCG still goes up. Five days later surgery for ectopic pregnancy with removal of my right fallopian tube. Waiting 3ish cycles instead of 6 months to TTC. \n\nMoral of the story - [as someone pointed out on my other post], you *CAN* have an ectopic pregnancy with no pain or symptoms!!\n", "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "ttcafterloss", "subreddit_id": "t5_34scd", "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Update to: HCG goes down, bleeding, then back up slightly?", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/ttcafterloss/comments/7i7cov/update_to_hcg_goes_down_bleeding_then_back_up/"}, {"author": "prettylittletrees", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_text": "26 | BO 10/09 | TFMR Triploidy 19w 5/10 | CP 10/17", "brand_safe": false, "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1512681945, "domain": "self.ttcafterloss", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/ttcafterloss/comments/7i9qau/mixed_feelings_after_first_re_visit/", "id": "7i9qau", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "locked": false, "num_comments": 5, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/ttcafterloss/comments/7i9qau/mixed_feelings_after_first_re_visit/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1512743308, "score": 9, "selftext": "So I had my first RE visit today. \n\nIt started out rough. I had a really hard time finding the place. Luckily, I got there in time anyway. I had to have a tele consult appointment since there isn't any RE's around where I live. The place I was having it at had no idea why I was there and didn't have me on the schedule. I was tearing up at this point and panicking. The office only does tele consults once a month and they're skipping January. I called the office and explained what was happening to the nurse and she was super helpful. Finally, they worked everything out. \n\nI discussed my past losses with the RE. He seemed knowledgable, but not very attentive. He brought up that he read I have a bicornuate uterus.. but I know I don't. I just had an ultrasound to check. Then he brought up the baby I lost had trisomy 18. That's not true either. I had markers for trisomy 18, but she actually had triploidy. I explained all of this multiple times, but he seemed to write me off. I was so confused and worried. These things would change everything I thought I knew about myself and my fertility. As I'm sure you guys are aware, trisomies could be hereditary and triploidy is random. I called my regular OB when I left and asked her to review my file. She reviewed every ultrasound I had and agreed that I do not have a bicornuate uterus. She stated the RE did not write that in his note either, so he must have realized he was mistaken. She also assured me that though it states in my file the initial markers suggested trisomy 18, my baby's karyotype showed triploidy. He must not have read carefully enough. He and the nurse kept mentioning \"the other patient\" that he must have been seeing after me. I think he mixed up our uterus shapes.. I know he's probably very busy, but really? \n\nHe ordered me more tests. Another thyroid test, antiphospholipid syndrome screening, karyotype and a sonohysterogram. \n\nI'm most nervous about the karyotype. If I have an issue with my chromosomes, there's no fixing that. He also told me to not get pregnant in the mean time. This makes me nervous since it's been 2 months since my last loss and we prevented the first month but not after that. I just ovulated this week and could possibly have conceived. He said that if everything comes back okay he will just have me try again anyway. So, hopefully it all works out. \n\nLater as I was waiting in the hospital lab to have my blood drawn my pharmacy called. They said \"you were just ordered an antibiotic for before the sonohysterogram, but our system is flagging you as pregnant. Are you pregnant?\" Nope, not anymore at least. Thanks. Ugghhh.\n\nWhat a day. All in all I'm satisfied. He ordered what I had expected. He did not once mention IVF. I was surprised and glad I didn't have to have that discussion.\n\nI just wanted to share this with someone besides my SO.

So as a recap last week I found out I had a blighted ovum at 8w5d, and took misoprostol to start the miscarriage last Thursday. \n\nToday at my ultrasound the tech did see some \"stuff\" in my uterus, but the sac was gone and almost everything passed. The doctor said that she was comfortable that I would likely pass what was left (a little blood and tissue) and only to call if I had heavy bleeding still next Wednesday, but she thinks it'll taper off. So that's good! \n\nBut last week the doctor had said we could try right away, and this week we'd be able to order blood work and look at things like progesterone and clotting issues etc. \n\nThe doctor today said no, we had to wait one regular period, and that I need another appt with my regular doctor (a third one from the previous 2) and at that point she could look into what tests I need. She also said progesterone was \"voodoo\", that it was hard to interpret and would only tell you if a pregnancy was failing but you couldn't do anything anyways. To which I said, well I would have loved to know 4 weeks ago this pregnancy was failing! \n\nLuckily my appt is the 20th with my regular doctor so I guess at that point we will talk about what tests I need. I am not sure if we will listen about waiting a regular period to try though. The first doctor said it wasn't necessary, I know a lot of them do but why conflicting info?\n\nAnyways, thanks ladies for all the support! It's been a really tough week but this group really helped me. I finally feel like I'm turning a corner with this loss and can move forward. \u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f", "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "ttcafterloss", "subreddit_id": "t5_34scd", "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "Follow up appointment after blighted ovum- good but frustrating.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/ttcafterloss/comments/7ihmwk/follow_up_appointment_after_blighted_ovum_good/"}, {"author": "Mermaidmomma24", "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_text": null, "brand_safe": false, "can_mod_post": false, "contest_mode": false, "created_utc": 1512766660, "domain": "self.ttcafterloss", "full_link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/ttcafterloss/comments/7ihxlz/unexpected_stillbirth_at_22_weeks/", "id": "7ihxlz", "is_crosspostable": true, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_self": true, "is_video": false, "locked": false, "num_comments": 20, "num_crossposts": 0, "over_18": false, "permalink": "/r/ttcafterloss/comments/7ihxlz/unexpected_stillbirth_at_22_weeks/", "pinned": false, "retrieved_on": 1512834967, "score": 35, "selftext": "I just gave birth to my sweet boy Harrison on Wednesday December 6th at 1215pm.

I don't know if many (or any) of you will remember me, but I was around a lot a whIle back after my daughter, Peyton, was stillborn at 25 weeks on Oct. 27, 2015.\n\nIt's been a while since I've been on here so I'm ahoping little rusty, I hope this type of post is allowed and that this is the right place for it. If not please let me know and I'll remove it asap. (Trigger warning: mention of LC.) \n\nPeyton was our firstborn, and after we lost her, I was pretty active on this thread while ttc again, and in the alumni thread. We had a healthy rainbow son born Sept. 4, 2016 after a very rocky pregnancy. He's now 15 months old, and because of what we went through with his pregnancy and having a close relationship w/ a mfm that I'm finally happy with, we've decided to ttc again. We are so incredibly lucky to have our son, but I've had a number of health issues come up postpartum with him that could cause fertility issues that will get worse with time. Adenometriosis being probably the worst. I also was diagnosed with hypothyroidism after I had him, but it's being controlled with synthroid. The problem is, since I had my son I have only had three periods. My body is not ovulating. We are set to start Clomid in February, but we are still hopeful that we might conceive without it if my body cooperates. \n\nThe past six days, my pks have been so so close to being positive, but one very small shade away from being as dark as the control (especially the ast three days). I've never had this happen before. Even with the three times I've ovulated since having my son, my pks were always stark white until they got as dark as the control for two days before fading out. (I've never had a test darker than the control, even before all this).\n\nI kept expecting the lines to get darker and they just haven't. I actually started tracking again in February, after my period didn't come back postpartum. My last cycle was two months ago. \n\nSo that's where I'm at.. I hope I haven't violated any rules posting this. I'm sorry we're all here, but the support from this thread has gotten me through so much.\n\n", "spoiler": false, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "ttcafterloss", "subreddit_id": "t5_34scd", "subreddit_type": "public", "thumbnail": "self", "title": "I'm back!

It was a little bothersome seeing super pregnant mamas this weekend knowing that would have been my alternate reality, but I'm coping pretty well otherwise. \n\nI decided to give this an actual post to give a little more visibility to the fact that this day can be okay. Sure, it's scary and feels a little out of control. Sure, I would have been THRILLED to be falling in love with a little one and getting ready to welcome him or her (but my gut told him \"him\") home. At the end of the day, so many other things in my life still are going well now, and I can't help but acknowledge and enjoy and appreciate that. \n\nIf I am being completely honest, some of the things that I appreciate now were an indirect reaction to the miscarriage. I am stronger than I ever have been because I decided to go to the gym to regain a feeling of control over my body. My work is going well because I have had more time to dedicate to it than I anticipated over the last few months. Of course, I would rather have had a baby today. Of course, I would rather have never had to experience the miscarriage at all. Still, today feels more like a mark of survival than anything else. My fear was not being pregnant again by the due date. That fear came true, and I'm still standing. It's not what I wanted, but facing that fear and being okay is empowering at the same time. \n\nI may have been a hot mess at various points over the last several months, but I survived - and continue to survive. Since I have used this forum so much to share my fears and sadness, I thought that I would take a moment to make a top level post sharing something a little positive as well.

I thought I\u2019d give an intro while I ask my question. My husband and I are 24 and this pregnancy was our first. I ovulated around Nov 10, BFP on 11/20. I had my hcg tested a few times, and it didn\u2019t look good. It wasn\u2019t doubling but it was going up so it seemed ectopic. \n\nI had my first OB appointment on Friday, and the doc told me I was at risk (I\u2019m an expert googler, so I knew this) for ectopic, and if I had any pain, to go to the ER,l. He did a quick transvaginal Scan and showed me both my ovaries, and they looked fine. Told me to get blood work on Saturday \n\nWell, Sunday around midnight, I thought my ass was going to fall off due to the shooting pains, and abdominal cramps. We went to the ER and they got me in pretty fast (this whole process still took 9 hours). They took my blood and a urine sample, and had me get an ultrasound. This ultrasound tech really took his time, and I\u2019m so happy he did. He said \u201cthey scanned you yesterday and didn\u2019t see anything?\u201d Turns out there was a 3.6cm something in my tube. So I was diagnosed with ectopic.\n\nOne comment the nurse made was that my HCG was lower on their test than the blood I gave less than 12 hours ago. (Sat HCG was 480, ER HCG 253). I find it weird that there would be that big a discrepancy in the labs. My theory is that I was starting to miscarry which is why I had pains, but I don\u2019t know.  I ended up getting the methotrexate shot at 0830 on Sunday.\n\nHow long does the shot take? Any experience with HcG this low? I\u2019ve read it can take a few weeks, but that just seems..odd.

I\u2019m back, again... I suppose I never really left. Just got the phone call from my doctor with the information I already knew was coming... \n\nThis is now my third loss this year, three cycles in a row. Two CP\u2019s in a row, and an MMC in July at 9 weeks. Why? I know that\u2019s something we all ask ourselves. But really, I just want to know *why.* And of course everyone I know is pregnant, or just had a baby. Having to go into the doctors office for blood work yesterday to confirm my dropping numbers and seeing all of these people coming in with their big bellies just really was the icing on the cake. \n\nI never wanted to be this bitter person. I\u2019m finding myself so *angry* at other people\u2019s happiness and that\u2019s just not who I am, but it\u2019s who I\u2019ve become... it\u2019s not their fault I\u2019m going through this, and it\u2019s not my fault either. *No one is at fault for this, but I feel like I need someone to blame...* \n\nAnd all of the empty \u201cI\u2019m sorry\u2019s\u201d And \u201cit will happen soon!\u201d And \u201cit just wasn\u2019t meant to be/god\u2019s plan for you\u201d ...seriously? You think that helps?! I\u2019ve been told by many people to just be thankful for the child I have. You think I\u2019m not thankful for him?! Can I not want another child? It\u2019s like it somehow is supposed to diminish my hurt from these losses. Spoiler alert, it doesn\u2019t. \n\nI\u2019m hurting both physically and emotionally right now. And being told how I need to feel by people who have never experienced this is starting to push me over the edge. Ugh, I\u2019m sorry. If you\u2019ve read through this far, thank you. I am very glad to have such a supportive community to vent my frustrations to, because no one understands it like y\u2019all do.
