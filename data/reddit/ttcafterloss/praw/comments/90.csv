Also I am very sorry for your loss and a loss is still a loss.

I think in terms of your friend’s comment about their surrogate not really being pregnant- unfortunately with a CP a lot of women wouldn’t even know they were pregnant unless they (like us!) were really in tune with their bodies because of tracking, and I think just in general a lot of people aren’t even aware that chemical pregnancies are a thing and that yes, it does mean you were pregnant, if only for a short time. So I don’t think your friends meant to be callous, but I totally understand feeling like, oh maybe I’m overreacting? But you’re not, it is totally understandable to be heartbroken. I hope your dream comes true soon! ❤️

I understand the wait is hard though ☺️</p>

<p>As for extra anxiety, YES. I was extremely anxious throughout.. but I thought, and still think, that I would’ve been really anxious no matter how long I waited. Both doctors said I didn’t <em>need</em> any extra testing before or during the next pregnancy, because the reason we terminated was a “lightning strike” random occurrence - but if I <em>wanted</em> extra scans, bloodwork, etc., they were fine with it.</p>

I was hoping to know by now a definitive answer as to whether or not I was pregnant. Negative test this morning. Still no symptoms of a period in sight. I feel betrayed and let down by my body. I thought I&#39;d been dealing with this pretty well but today I feel just terrible. Not helping is the fact that I found out last week that one of my good friends is pregnant.

I&#39;m grateful for the parents who get to go home with their babies but this tradition is really triggering for me and it&#39;s inescapable and I&#39;m afraid that I&#39;m going to have a breakdown at some point and embarass myself.</p>

I’m so sorry for the novel! Apparently I have a lot to get off my chest. I hope it’s ok to post all of this! 

I somehow got a BFP today on a FRER. I say somehow because the timing is a little off. I found out we had a MMC at 10 weeks on 1/7, D&C on 1/10, HCG was officially down to 4 on 2/17 (per bloodwork but I suspect it was down sooner than that since my last blood test a few weeks prior and I was at 29). 

I had a verrrry light period 2/11-2/15 and then last Friday (2/21) I had a gush of bright red blood (not enough to fill a panty liner but it all came out at once) so I thought maybe my actual period was starting but then no more blood at all. This Monday I ovulated according to OPKs and I’ve been obsessively tracking my temp with FF so naturally I woke up on Tuesday with a fever of 102 due to a surprise case of strep throat. So my temps have been useless. 

I started testing with cheap internet tests on Tuesday because I felt slight cramping in my lower abdomen and my first symptom of the last pregnancy hit me- sudden, inexplicable weepiness. It crossed my mind that maybe the blood on Friday was implantation bleeding and that my cycle is kind of wonky after the MC so there might be a small chance and since I’ve been loading up on meds all week I should at least check. 

The last two days I’ve taken 7 tests and all of them had super-barely there shadows. Like, 3 steps below squinters. I didn’t even tell my husband because I was 99% sure I was losing my mind and seeing what I wanted to see. Anyways, today I finally bought some FRERs and... the line isn’t even a squinter. It’s fully there. 

I’m thrilled. And worried it will be a CP. But- today I am pregnant. 

Anyone else get a BFP after a super wonky post-MC cycle?",[],,t1_fizfirm,False,0,[],False,"<div class=""md""><p>TW: MC</p>

<p>I’m so sorry for the novel! Apparently I have a lot to get off my chest. I hope it’s ok to post all of this! </p>

<p>I somehow got a BFP today on a FRER. I say somehow because the timing is a little off. I found out we had a MMC at 10 weeks on 1/7, D&amp;C on 1/10, HCG was officially down to 4 on 2/17 (per bloodwork but I suspect it was down sooner than that since my last blood test a few weeks prior and I was at 29). </p>

<p>I had a verrrry light period 2/11-2/15 and then last Friday (2/21) I had a gush of bright red blood (not enough to fill a panty liner but it all came out at once) so I thought maybe my actual period was starting but then no more blood at all. This Monday I ovulated according to OPKs and I’ve been obsessively tracking my temp with FF so naturally I woke up on Tuesday with a fever of 102 due to a surprise case of strep throat. So my temps have been useless. </p>

<p>I started testing with cheap internet tests on Tuesday because I felt slight cramping in my lower abdomen and my first symptom of the last pregnancy hit me- sudden, inexplicable weepiness. It crossed my mind that maybe the blood on Friday was implantation bleeding and that my cycle is kind of wonky after the MC so there might be a small chance and since I’ve been loading up on meds all week I should at least check. </p>

I’m not an expert or doctor but from my own research some women who miscarry early before 12 weeks can sometimes have progesterone suppositories help. If you miscarry after this time frame when the placenta should’ve taken over it could be a number of different issues. One could be a blood disorder. This is why you hear some women take baby aspirin while they are pregnant. A test for this would be antiphospholipid blood test. But again there are many different types of blood disorders which could be only found through their specific blood testing. A lot of miscarriages happen due to a chromosome issue with the baby as well. I believe that the 12 week anatomy scan doesn’t detect every single issue. Even the pathology they do on the fetuses after the miscarriage can test for all chromosome issues. 

There are so many reasons why a woman may have miscarried and this is why you would have to get a blood panel done by a specialist. My OB’s wife had 5 miscarriages and that’s why he ordered the antiphospholipid testing because it was something he had done on his own wife. But many obs may not have had the personal miscarriage experiences that my doctor has had and they aren’t trained to know all the test names. Unfortunately you may have to pay out of pocket at a specialist office for that peace of mind of getting a full pregnancy loss blood panel. 

I just want to say that I’ve miscarried, had 3 successful normal pregnancies and then went on to have two miscarriages after that. It happens often and I know you want to have all the answers before you take the jump but honestly many of us have to just try when you haven’t had 3 repeated losses. 

If you want to do your own research on miscarriages I’ve heard many good things about the book “it starts with an egg”. I believe that’s the title. The doctor breaks down miscarriages and pregnancy and even gives you a cheat sheet of vitamins and food choices to help have a successful pregnancy.

My husband and I lost our first pregnancy in September to Tri13. Following meeting wit genetic counsellors and karyotype bloodwork, it was found that I am a robertsonian balanced translocation carrier of Tri 13-14. Basically, I have the correct number of chromosomes BUT my 13th and 14th basically hold hands... 

It. Sucks. Knowing our chances of carrying a healthy, viable pregnancy is quite slim is... hard. We’ve gone on to see a fertility specialist who doesn’t seem to understand that I’m a translocation carrier and just keeps telling us that reoccurrence of Tri13 is low, but is that “low” number worth it for us emotionally to try again naturally?

So, we’re looking at IVF with my eggs with PGD... in saying that, I know odds aren’t in our favour of getting viable embryos. Also, we’re looking at a 9-12 month wait for IVF funding through our home province (Ontario, Canada). My heart hurts just thinking of that wait and possible let down.

I’ve never been mad about our TFMR... but I am so saddened that some days I am flat out mad with this diagnosis and uncertainty for the future. My husband and I have been together for 17.5 years, married for almost 3, and it eats me up with (I know, not necessary) guilt that he likely won’t become a father. He’s an amazing, patient, nurturing man that would make a great father. I *know* that adoption or surrogate are options, but those aren’t options that were considering right now.

I’m sorry that you’re going through what you’re going through and for your’s and your husband’s losses. I would go through karyotype testing to determine your next steps. I sincerely hope that it’s just been crappy luck for you and your previous pregnancies and that the blood tests will be for nothing.

In the end I lost my pregnancy (trisomy 15) and I’m glad I didn’t decide to stay because the reality is you have no idea what will happen. You could end up feeling handcuffed to your job for years and never be pregnant.</p>

IT'S NOT TOO LATE! Age is a number. But, I will say, focus on your mental health and physical health of yourself first. Try to do things that make you think positively (this has been hard for me because my outlet is taking long walks, yoga and going to the gym and I haven't been able to do any of those things for over 10 weeks). I recently started using some guided meditation at night and it's been really nice. I want more than anything to have another child. I'm not exactly in the same boat bc I have 3 boys, but we lost our little girl and we wanted to have just one more. 2 older boys are from a previous marriage and my current husband and I wanted 2 of our own, especially since my big boys are 10 and 13 and my baby is 20m.

&#x200B;

Anyway, we're here for you. Talk to your doctor about concerns, any help you might need, testing etc and then let nature take its course. It's been a hard pill to swallow, losing my little girl. My ONLY girl. It's devastating. I know I'd have been devastated if it was a boy as well, but it stings because we had just found out it was a girl and we fell in love with the idea. I'm not even sure I'd find out that early next time around because I don't want to get too attached.

&#x200B;

That was long winded, but, just know we're here for you and so many of us are unfortunately in the same boat. I'm 10 1/2 weeks out from my ankle break and almost 14w past my loss.

I also broke my ankle very severely on Friday the 13th of December, 3 weeks exactly after my D and E for my 13 week loss. I&#39;m also *almost* 37. I had 4 weeks off work, plus 2 weeks of Christmas break (I&#39;m a teacher) so I had time to physically recover enough to drag myself back to work, but it has been rough. I&#39;ve cried in my office during planning more times than I can shake a stick at.</p>

<p>&#x200B;</p>

<p>IT&#39;S NOT TOO LATE! Age is a number. But, I will say, focus on your mental health and physical health of yourself first. Try to do things that make you think positively (this has been hard for me because my outlet is taking long walks, yoga and going to the gym and I haven&#39;t been able to do any of those things for over 10 weeks). I recently started using some guided meditation at night and it&#39;s been really nice. I want more than anything to have another child. I&#39;m not exactly in the same boat bc I have 3 boys, but we lost our little girl and we wanted to have just one more. 2 older boys are from a previous marriage and my current husband and I wanted 2 of our own, especially since my big boys are 10 and 13 and my baby is 20m.</p>

<p>&#x200B;</p>

<p>Anyway, we&#39;re here for you. Talk to your doctor about concerns, any help you might need, testing etc and then let nature take its course. It&#39;s been a hard pill to swallow, losing my little girl. My ONLY girl. It&#39;s devastating. I know I&#39;d have been devastated if it was a boy as well, but it stings because we had just found out it was a girl and we fell in love with the idea. I&#39;m not even sure I&#39;d find out that early next time around because I don&#39;t want to get too attached.</p>

<p>&#x200B;</p>

<p>That was long winded, but, just know we&#39;re here for you and so many of us are unfortunately in the same boat. I&#39;m 10 1/2 weeks out from my ankle break and almost 14w past my loss. I still can&#39;t walk without pain, or very far at all. I can&#39;t take care of my baby 100% yet. It&#39;s all adding insult to injury and I&#39;m really praying 2020 is a better year for me and YOU!</p>

I interviewed for a ton of other jobs while we continued to try. I ultimately figured there is no good time to &quot;plan&quot; for a baby and I was tired of putting my life and career on hold trying to conceive a baby that could possibly never happen. </p>

<p>Are you willing to wait another two months at your job? Six, nine, eighteen? TW: Pregnancy. It took me nine months to get pregnant again, and now I&#39;m 6w when I&#39;ve only been at my job two months. There is no good timing for it, but I love my job and I&#39;ll be done with grad school if this one goes the distance.</p>

<p>TLDR: Live your life. This shit is really stressful and hard to plan, so just live your life. You&#39;ve got this. You&#39;re strong and badass and amazing and will make the right decisions for yourself.<br/>

<p>Edit: I should have very clearly led with I am so sorry for your loss, and I can’t stress how much I am sorry. I know the pain, frustration and heartbreak you’re feeling, and I am so sorry I didn’t acknowledge that up front.</p>

My SIL also had a high risk pregnancy right after our loss and I hated hearing about it. That was difficult enough to try to navigate... your situation sounds awful. Wish I had more advice, other than to try to validate your feelings.

Only other thing I can relate it to is that I had a fight with FIL back in Oct. (Not TTC related). He is a true asshole when he drinks and he called, drunk, and was picking my husband apart. He is big and loud and intimidating so I never stood up to him before but that night I had enough and told him how I felt. MIL is in complete denial and stood up for FIL. I took a huge step back. FIL sent some BS text apologizing for me interpreting what he was saying wrong. I went very low contact with them after that. We didn't see them for the holidays or after. Yesterday we arranged to meet them for lunch and although I was super nervous, it went fine. 

Some things that I think helped that maybe could help you?: 
1) meeting in a neutral setting, like a restaurant or coffee shop. Limits raised voices for fear of making a scene. 
2)Your husband and you HAVE to talk to about this before you meet and become a united front. There is strength in that, that you will need. You should also try to get him on board with limiting contact with MIL and whomever else in his family that you need space from. Unfortunately, it will probably come to that, but if that's what you need for your mental health, that's what you have to do! 
3) I would also work to accept the possibility that MIL may never see her part or accept responsibility for making you feel worse in an already emotionally turbulent situation. Don't expect her to apologize or see your side of things. Acceptance isn't a free pass, but it will set you free from trying to change someone that doesn't want to change. Just saves you stress and energy. 

Again, I am so sorry for everything you are dealing with! Post an update? Curious how it turns out and although I mostly just lurk here...

I might ask to have a conversation with your OB about this, and have him or her explain the rationale for recommending medical inducement. It is completely reasonable for you to want to understand what your body is going through, and any doctor with his or her patient’s well being in mind should be happy to explain why this is the best type of care for your situation. 

This seems like it is really just a question of which risk schedule is more preferable than the other.

With d&c there are risks like perforated uterus, scarring, and infection that could contribute to or cause infertility. But sometimes, like when you’re closer to 10+ weeks for example, the risk of losing too much blood at once or hemorrhaging presents when considering the medication option. In those cases, it’s preferable to use surgical removal, because severe blood loss can be fatal or require riskier treatment like a transfusion. 

At 6 weeks, however, it would not be as big of a risk to pass “naturally” and lose too much blood because there is significantly less fetal product present, but the risks with d&c remain.  For this kind of situation, it may be a bigger risk to undergo another surgery, and it sounds like your OB is hesitant to introduce new trauma to your body when it may not be necessary because of how far along you are.

I know it feels gruesome and insensitive to be asked to save product, but it would help to understand a potential cause for your reoccurring losses, and consequently some kind of treatment to either eliminate the cause or mitigate it so that you will be able to continue with a full term pregnancy. That certainly doesn’t make it easy, but at least it’s purposeful.

The part I’m stuck with though, if there is no heartbeat, I’m confused at why your OB is saying the pregnancy may still be viable? Was no HB confirmed or suspected?

If you miscarried at 8 weeks then the level of HCG in your system will probably be quite high, and take a while to go down even if your miscarriage is complete and you have no retained products. That means you probably won't be able to tell any time soon whether you have passed everything just by doing a pregnancy test. If you can, I would recommend getting a follow up ultrasound to check whether your uterus is empty or there is still pregnancy tissue remaining. Once you've had the all clear, if possible get a beta HCG test to check the level of HCG in your system. If you can't get a blood test, you can do regular pregnancy tests. If you think you will only want to test in a couple of weeks and then maybe at weekly intervals until you get a negative, use regular ones. If you think that (like me) you'll be obsessively peeing on sticks every day to check whether you're back to zero yet, buy a bulk back of cheap strip tests.

Once the HCG has cleared out of your system your cycle will begin again. Your doctor might tell you to wait until after you've had a period before you start trying again. This is mostly so that they can date any new pregnancy more easily, because if you ovulate and conceive before you get a period, you won't have the date of your last period to go on to determine how far along you are. Sometimes if you have to have a D&C they will also tell you to wait a bit to let your uterine lining recover. As far as I can tell this isn't really supported by any evidence, and my gynaecologist told me I could start trying again as soon as the bleeding stopped (and I had failed medical management and then an MVA, which is more physically invasive than your natural miscarriage, assuming you have fully passed everything and don't need any intervention).

I don't know if you were tracking ovulation beforehand but if you were, be warned that it can be really difficult to track in the first cycle after a miscarriage. If you are temping, your temperatures may be all over the place, and if you are using OPKs, they can't tell the difference between LH and HCG and will generally show positive until the HCG has fully cleared out of your system. I didn't manage to identify ovulation after my second miscarriage (although we didn't try that cycle anyway) and this time round we are trying again straight away but I don't know whether I will manage to pinpoint it because everything is still out of whack. You may also have a shorter than usual luteal phase in the first cycle after a miscarriage.

I found at out 9 weeks that baby stopped growing at 7w1d.i had a scan the week before and baby had measured 7w exactly with a heartbeat of 140.

Light spotting on Jan 28, Jan 29 I went to the ER around 10:30am because it was heavier. They did bloodwork and a scan. No heartbeat. I was out of the hospital around about 1pm. i needed rhogam shots as I have negative blood type and my husband is positive. By 2 Pm I passed baby still in sac. No contraction pain but one lighting crotch sensation about 10min before sac came out. That night, or the next morning rather, around 4:30am I had contractions for maybe half an hour. I woke up because it hurt and put an episode of Schitt’s creek on, so that’s how I estimated the time. I probably had 7-9 contractions then went to the bathroom and passed a large piece of white tissue. After that the pain was gone. I bled similar to my period for the next 5 days. I had an appt scheduled already exactly a week after the Mc for a prenatal check, so I kept that. My dr did an ultrasound and found that there was a small amount of blood left in my uterus. He said it would probably pass in a day or two. He was right. I had spotting the next day. Not even enough to wear a panty liner, then it was done.

Counting the day I passed baby as cd1, I ovulated on cd 20. It’s only 3 days after that now so we’ll see how things turn out. Dr gave us the okay to try again as soon as we were emotionally ready.

Today was your due date. Technically you only had a 50% chance of being born on this day... and technically it was really tomorrow... but today was the hardest. I would have been waiting for you this whole time and I would have loved to hold you in my arms. Unfortunately you never became you.

And, I'm sorry that you didn't get to experience those let downs and I'm sorry that you never were, and no matter how much I wish you were, I know, and you unfortunately know as well, that life is like that sometimes. And while you don't have a name, you are my child. And while you don't have a body, and by all scientific reasoning you may not even have had one ever... I loved you. I love you. And even though no one else will ever know how much I love you, you will. And even though I didn't get to meet you today, I hold you in my heart forever. And even though you were not in this world very long, if at all, I was touched by you for the small time that you were. And I'm sorry. I'm sorry that my body fucked up. I'm sorry that I didn't get you to the right place and I'm sorry that that happened. And I know accidents happen. And I forgive you for not making it to the right place. And I need to forgive myself for not getting you to the right place. And that's all. Maybe one day I'll see a twinkle of you in the eye of your future brother or sister. Goodbye.

They called ( this stupid f\*ing early pregnancy clinic at the hospital) the following tuesday and said that they collected zero tissue.  I had no idea what that meant but the nurse said I must have passed it before the procedure.  This made no sense to me and after my D&C I started to bleed daily I decided to follow up with my GP since this clinic seemed inept .  I had 4 private ultrasounds one every week of august and all of them showed fluid in the uterus that we kept waiting to pass. 

Finally I decided enough is enough. I went around the clinic and found out my surgeons name ( who is now my lovley OB) and made an appointment directly with her office.  She Explained that The D&C is a blind procedure that is based on certain grids and they often miss tissue ( I DO NOT UNDERSTAND why they do not ultrasound during every D&C?! like WTF not apparently only on your 3rd do they ultrasound, ridiculous). She said look there is something holding in all that fluid either a blood clot or retained tissue, she sent me for a beta and when it showed a beta of around 30 she said yup its tissue.  She said do you have a high pain tolerance bc I can try to pull out the tissue in my office today but we do not have time for pain management.  I decided to do it al let me tell you it was the worst pain of my life a 10/10.   She pulled some tissue and all the sudden the clearish bloody fluid came out like my water breaking and I thought all is good. She said look I think what we did may mean we've avoided the ER again but lets check this time with a hospital ultrasound.

I went in the next week and they saw everything. Most of the fetal tissue was still present and they could not believe that it was not seen on previous ultrasounds even with the fluid.   It was now the start of sept and it was clear I needed another D&C but this time there was a wait to get it with the camera . by the middle of sept  I was bleeding so heavily that I was soaking my pants and was feeling unwell 24/7 Over the next 5 days I was back and forth in ER and finally after a 24 hour wait they booked me in for an emergency D&C at 10pm on Friday Sept 20th. My fiance and dad were furious that they weren't using the camera but the doctor was confident that it was not worth the risk. This time the doctor was confident he got it all and said that I had a slight tilt to the uterus that was probably why it was missed the first time. This time they also gave me Miso rectally after completion of the surgery and I WAS IN AGONY. Between that and the D&C I went into full on labour contractions but passed nothing additional. 

2 weeks later I went septic.  I caught it very very early and was whisked into the ER instantly and put on a drip.  I was cleared a few days later with a healthy empty uterus in early OCT.  My cycle returned on the 20th,  I saw my OB on halloween. She said lets do fertility testing next month but hey it's the 11th day of your cycle why don't you ditch the trick or treaters and try tonight.  We did and now i'm 18 weeks !

Now, regarding your questions. Short answer is you never stop obsessing. Especially after a miscarriage. As cruel as it is with the miscarriege we get robbed from part of the joy a successful first pregnancy brings. The worry doesn't stop. In fact it becomes worse. What does change is how you deal with it. For you it's still too fresh. He'll it's too fresh for me and it's been two months since mine and one cycle of post MC trying... With time you'll manage to handle your anxiety and worries. Same goes for your grief. There will be easy days and hard days, it's not w straight line process. But all in all you'll gradually manage to deal. What has helped me is spending as much time as i can to my favorite hobbies (photography and writing). I try to keep myself busy during the waiting between cycles, and when a million stressful thought's invade my mind I remind myself there's little I can control and just plainly struggle to be positive. 

Regarding friends' pregnancies... That's a tough one. Personally I'm stuck in that space between being happy for them but also not wanting to see them till I'm pregnant again and well into my second trimester. Of course that ain't possible, so I'm just being honest about being happy for them but also struggling with my loss and feelings. True friends will understand. Just be open with communication. Also venting here every now and that helps loads. 

So all in all hang in there and give yourself time. Not everything will sort out immediately. Be kind to yourself, process your loss and aknowledge your feelings. If toy struggle a lot with anxiety and grief maybe see a counselor/therapist for a couple of times, see if that will help.
