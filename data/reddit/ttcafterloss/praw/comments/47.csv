I've gone through phases. I'm 33 weeks today. I'll preface all of this by saying that I'm not and probably will not ever feel 100% excited, enjoy this process, and feel safe in the way that someone who hasn't had losses would feel. But I do have hope and moments and an overall feeling of cautious excitement. All three of my losses were early, so after I reached 8-9 weeks I told myself ""okay, this is going to go one of two ways:  it's going to work out or it's not. I'll grieve and mourn for it if it doesn't work out if/when that happens. All I can do now is take it day by day"". 

Around 12 weeks I was like ""k, made it this far. Cool"" and felt attached to the pregnancy, but not baby. Once we learned the sex at 17+3, things really started to feel real. It was no longer just a vague baby, but a little boy. I began to imagine him and what he'd be like and it made me want to be excited. I stopped cringing so much when people talked about ""WHEN baby gets here"" and I allowed myself to talk about ""him"". I stopped prefacing every conversation with ""if we bring baby home"" and eventually replaced it with ""when..."". Don't get me wrong, in the back of my mind I catch myself and say ""IF...remember...if"" but I just sort of let those thoughts come in and go out without ruminating. 

At 25 weeks I let my guard down and decided I had feelings for this babe. Not just the pregnancy, but the baby. Kicks help. I finished a registry. My baby shower is this weekend. I've seen photos of what babies born at 30-33 weeks look like and they are fully formed babes. It's a shock to me when I see that and realize THATS inside of me. So I figure - he's big, he's moving, he's REAL, and I should celebrate him and love him now - no matter what. And I know women who have experienced later term loss do not regret loving or celebrating their babies in the moment. Of course the events such as registering or showers are painful to think about after a loss, but I think what may be more painful is looking back and regretting not celebrating out of fear, regardless of the outcome. 

So to answer your questions, I feel like confidence isn't something women who are PAL really get to feel.  Statistics and probabilities don't really matter/apply to us anymore, we often know too much about what can go wrong to ever feel safe. I think for many, it's about getting through day by day and allowing ourselves to ride the uncertainty, become a little more comfortable with the discomfort and unknown and just do the best we can. I know women who did not buy a crib until their children were born. Those that refuse to have a shower or do anything until baby is in arms. And that's okay and understandable. But if you want to be excited, nothing needs to hold you back. I hope that it comes for you - just remember that being excited or letting your guard down will not jinx you. This process is so hard and it's important to have good moments when we can. ",[],,t1_dnkehll,False,0,[],False,"<div class=""md""><p>Such great questions. I&#39;ve gone through phases.

<p>Take a non digital test. It will give you more answers.</p>

<p>Edit: nevermind I see you did. I would trust that more than the digital. If your wondfo never went positive, I don&#39;t think it&#39;s a CP. You probably just ovulated late.</p>

Found out over the weekend on vacation. A little shocked and cautiously hopeful. I really hope we can bring this baby home alive. 

I had a miscarriage at 8 weeks years ago, and lost my son at 39 weeks this year in March. No living children.

Spotted 2 days before period was due (which is odd), it did not show up on time (it usually does), and then I got some brown discharge a few days later and tested a week after. Two very dark lines. 

What's ironic is I felt this was the one month it would not happen because Mr. Waffle had a horrible bout of poison ivy all over his body. I tracked in July and got 8 positive opks; in August, a normal period but never got a positive OPK. The days I didn't take an ovulation test/POAS is prob one of the days I was positive for it but I missed it since I figured it was not likely this cycle. 

Going to call doc to make an appointment. I miss my son so very much. I want this baby but also have many mixed feelings about getting attached. There is no safe time in pregnancy.

Had a missed miscarriage in July at about 6/7 weeks. It was my first-ever pregnancy and very much wanted. 

Period came back in August like clockwork. Ovulated Sept. 8 based on sudden spike in zits, horniness.

Period should have shown up Friday, but didn't. The cheap pee sticks read negative or invalid, but today I sprung for the First Response test and got the BFP. Going to the doc next week to confirm.

I'm nervous. I've spent far too much time reading the internet about women who have two, three, four miscarriages before having even one successful pregnancy. I realize, statistically, that my chances of having another are actually pretty low (no health complications, active lifestyle, no rollercoasters in my future). But my mind is a viper's nest sometimes and I'm scared of falling in.

Yesterday I took my toddler to a friend's parents' barn so we could see the horses and chickens, which was very fun! My friend's mom, Mrs. H, was showing my daughter the chicken coop and pulled out all the eggs to show us. They were pink and blue which was very cool. But one egg didn't have a smooth shell like all the others-- it was ridged and bumpy, and Mrs. H explained that that one was laid by their oldest hen. I was fascinated. 

Last night I had a dream that I broke into their chicken coop this morning to steal the old hen's egg to examine the deteriorating egg quality and wonder about my own fertility. I was caught by Mrs. H and invited in for omelettes. (What a appropriate unintentional punishment-- eat this egg that represents your greatest fears about the state of your own reproductive system!) I explained to her about my recent stillbirth, and our unsuccessful attempts at conception in the months since, and how her hen's deteriorating egg quality felt symbolic and frightening to me.

And then I saw a cat on their floor dressed in a tshirt from my college, eating from a bag of potato chips. And then I woke up. 

So. I really can't wait to shrink that one with my therapist when she gets back to town next week.

In other news, last night I gave myself my trigger shot so I should ovulate this weekend. We had Very Romantic Timed Baby Making Intercourse (VRTBI) last night and are supposed to have VRBTI again tomorrow morning and today is optional, but I had a massive temp dip today and an OPK that was very nearly positive so we're going to do it today in case I actually ovulate today.

But I know I should hear him out and let him try his best at improving his numbers...he did say he knows I need to be pregnant again; that I need it badly. No shit. So I am trying to remain patient but I'm not optimistic about TTC this cycle.

<p>But now I am trying to push myself super hard at work and at the gym, and I become emotionally exhausted--too exhausted to deal with extra shit that&#39;s going to upset me.

I started my weekly appointments a couple days ago and that feels crazy. I had my cervix check (1cm dilated) and probably won't opt to do that again. It hurt more than I expected and I bled a decent amount that day.

<p>The only thing I can think to do is to keep them locked in a separate room and test them periodically (and keep the ones that are testing negative in a third room) while I keep looking for adopters but 6 cats + my own cats are expensive so I don&#39;t know how long I can keep up with it. I live in a small town which explains the vet&#39;s attitude and the small shelter but I could try driving elsewhere in the state if they could take them in at a different no-kill shelter. </p>

It's not her. I like her A LOT, we have good rapport, I feel like I can always vent or cry or talk to her about anything, which I really enjoy. She has been a great help to me since Riyad died.

But I feel like I've reached a point in my grief where I don't have to see her all the time. I see her once a week now. I am thinking of moving it to once every two weeks. There's a limit to how much she can help me, and I think I've reached that limit. For example, I used to get a lot of use out of her when I irrationally blamed myself for Riyad's death. She set me up with logical arguments to counter my thoughts, etc. Now I don't really blame myself anymore, so mainly I talk to her about my life, what's going on now with TTC, and my son's death. And while she gives me a sympathetic ear, some of her suggestions are just...annoying and typical ""mother who has never lost a child"" type suggestions. 

For example, the last time I saw her, I was telling her how frustrated I am about maybe having to move to IVF, and my husband's low SA. And she seemed SO EXCITED. Like, overly so. I thought I was framing things wrong in my head.  I think she was trying to nudge me to the mentality of ""yes, you are forming an action plan with your RE, so you should be excited! You will find a solution soon!"" But now that I think about it, I SHOULD be upset that my husband is borderline infertile, and I am rightly grieving the possibility of our infertility as a couple. Maybe there's some relief that I didn't spend countless months questioning why I'm getting BFNs, but there's no excitement here. 

Also...she suggested the possibility that my husband's abnormal sperm morphology may be related to my stillbirth. Uhhh, no. I don't think abnormal sperm would have anything to do with a full-term stillbirth at 38 weeks. She also said something along the lines of ""because miscarriages and stillbirths are nature's way of taking care of something that would have gone wrong after birth..."" and that one just pissed me off! 

Okay, so I'm getting upset typing this. I guess this really does show me that my therapist has served her primary purpose, and she's really shit at other discussions I want to talk about, because she tries to suggest things and get scientific / medical where she simply has no experience in that field and has no idea what she's talking about. But when it comes to grief, I love her! 

SO I am going to see less of her. And just focus on the grief aspect of things. It's exasperating.

It's got to be hard with a toddler to take care of at the same time.

If it's helpful, I just talked to my doctor and he said the reasons for waiting were twofold:

1. A lot of people want to immediately replace their miscarried pregnancy with another pregnancy, but ignore their emotional need to process and grieve the loss. Doesn't apply to everybody, obviously, but some people need this medical advice.

2. If you get pregnant immediately and the next pregnancy miscarries too, some people will say, ""Oh, you didn't let everything clear out of the uterus,"" or ""See, you should have had a D&C, your doctor gave you bad medical care."" If you have at least one healthy period in between miscarriages, people will take the second one more seriously (and you won't feel guilty that you should have waited longer).

He said neither of these are especially medical or compelling reasons. They just make life easier, especially if the next pregnancy also ends in miscarriage.

The context for all of this is that he didn't see any tissue in my uterus on Monday and my hcg levels are already very low (130 today), so he's confident everything will come out naturally. If this isn't the case for you, the advice would likely be different.

<p>I am anxiously awaiting the chance to schedule my husband&#39;s next sperm analysis. He  really wants to wait until late September/ early October. Honestly I&#39;m guessing it&#39;s better anyway so he has a chance to somewhat raise his count. I got him Fertilaid for men and Motility Boost. To my surprise he&#39;s on board with supplements! So I&#39;m trying to stay optimistic with that, at least. </p>

<p>Yesterday I was SUPER depressed and literally slept all day after work. But I guess I needed another bad day. Because I&#39;m good now. Relatively speaking. </p>

I still don't feel completely relieved.... my husband almost had a panic attack sitting in the chair. I really don't know when this will feel better for us. 

I talked to the Dr about my NIPT results - how confident she felt, fetal fraction, how results were reported, and we had a good conversation. Her one ""complaint"" about the test is that it is reported as positive/negative rather than low-risk/high-risk and she said that she has never had anyone ask her about usage of those specific terms.

She did say ""I see a brother and sister and they aren't sure what order they want to be born"" so time will tell if that's accurate.

And this next part may be super triggering so TRIGGER WARNING about what psychics/intuitives believe about miscarriage, surprisingly I actually found a lot of relief in it:


She told me ""when miscarriage happens a lot of people think that they missed out on knowing the person that was never born, but that isn't the case. The spirit of your child is born into the body that is right for them. The spirit still exists, you only lose the body.  When you're pregnant the baby's spirit sits at your crown chakra and goes through you at birth, which is when the spirit fully enters the body.""

Yes it's very ~out there~ and I don't think anyone is wrong to call it bullshit. But the thought that I'll still one day meet the ""people"" (spirits) that would have embodied the babies I lost is kind of comforting in a way. 

Anyway, I don't know that I'd do the psychic thing again but I did appreciate the experience.

It sn&#39;t necessarily that I don&#39;t feel it shouldn&#39;t have happened to me, because I tend to ask &quot;why not me?&quot; Rather than &quot;why me?&quot;. But the thing that bothers me is that it doesn&#39;t seem normal or right for any one person to experience a late termination then infertility. Like, that is just such a weird combination that I never imagined. </p>

<p>Thanks for listening and understanding.</p>

I know eliminating eggs seems strange and opposite of most fertility recommendations.

Short answer for everything is to help the immune system.

The suggestion to eliminate eggs is based mostly on personal experience and case studies I've observed, however, the results were intriguing. Looking at miscarriage from an immunological perspective (this is more specific to repeated loss without a medical reason), removing eggs may reduce viral and bacterial load on the body- something I think research will eventually correlate with miscarriages, along with MTHFR test abnormalities. There are some current research studies correlating immune system and miscarriage (uterine NK cells). Of course correlation isn't causation, but I think it's worth noting. 

I used to strongly recommend eating a lot of eggs and did so myself. It seems to be fine for some women and not great for others (typical!). White blood cell count in myself, as well as others, went from the very low end of normal to a robust, solid count after removing eggs and adding monolaurin (two factors that should be tested separately, but who wants to wait?!).

Again, this is NOT actual research. I hope to do real research on it someday, but decided waiting until that happened could potentially keep thousands of women from having a healthy baby. 

As for the supplements, needs depend on your own physiology and lifestyle, but it's all an extension of the general recommendation to take a prenatal.

My friend Farah, whose son was stillborn, told me how his death really showed her who her true friends and family are. She has also had relatives act like nothing ever happened, friends who just smiled and pretended everything was okay in life. And she dropped those people. I thought it would resonate with you, because it did with me as well. If I have gained anything from my son's death, it would be a greater clarity in people. People have disappointed me and surprised me in many different ways. Those who I thought would be close and sympathetic to me, have pissed me off and it's broken my ties with them. But there are others who have been kind, understanding and loving--people that I did not expect. It sucks, but honestly, nothing is going to illuminate the true character of a person like grief will. 

I love how you can still be friends with the girl who had twins. I am like this with my husband's niece. I COMPLETELY cut off contact with one of my SILs, because she is oblivious to my pain, to the point of obsessively talking about her current pregnancy and how cute her 2 year old daughter is and how the birth went and blah blah blah. But my husband's niece has a 1 yr old daughter and is extremely sympathetic and kind with me. I can text her whatever the hell I want and she will listen. 

Anyway, this was a ramble, but I just wanted to say that I understand your frustrations completely and it's crazy how the people closest to us in blood can be so stupid and ignorant, and we can find greater companionship in others. I hope things will be okay for you at your cousins' upcoming wedding and that you found a little peace today. <3

I did the same thing with my career: put it first and thought I could time a pregnancy around it. LOLOLOL. Life has other plans. At this point, I&#39;ve realized that I can certainly try to plan ahead but life will throw curve balls, so just expect the unexpected. Sucks but also reality. Like you, I&#39;ve accepted it. But it&#39;s still sad and frustrating and I beat myself up a lot. UGH.</p>

I haven&#39;t unwrapped even the free items from registry boxes or washed the few items of clothing we have. My husband is beginning to really feel excited I can tell and it&#39;s just all so overwhelming. I&#39;m having a shower in two weeks and I just hope I can keep my chill and enjoy it instead of worrying. </p>

Yes this place does feel like home, and I am glad to see some renewed activity over at Rainbow Babies, because I miss you guys! I no longer see you in the FB group? It has a weekly update as well, which I think is great because of all the CUTE baby pics. 

Family is wonderful, little guy is thriving and such a happy baby. Juggling the baby, work, breastfeeding, the dog, the house and friends and family (and let's not forget some relationship quality time) is challenging but I manage - and I treasure every moment with my boy. 

And yay for extra monitoring! Hugs

This morning my husband and I visited the RE, and I'm SO glad we went and I'm so glad we didn't wait any longer. He was perfectly nice and understanding (I was concerned he'd be dismissive and kind of dickish, like he was a year and a half ago-- but he really wasn't!) and looked at my charts and agreed that even for postpartum from a full-term delivery, something is weird about my luteal phases, especially since I am clearly ovulating and my hormones at the beginning of the cycle are normal.

Since I had two CPs before conceiving my daughter, and my stillbirth was unexplained, he said he wanted to do some bloodwork to rule out any clotting disorders I may have which would only manifest during pregnancy and be easily addressed with blood thinners. In the meantime he told me to start taking a baby aspirin daily because it couldn't cause any harm and could very well help. 

Then he told me he wanted to do some imaging to make sure there were no red flags in my uterus-- especially since I had a D&C following delivery for some retained placental tissue. He wants to make sure there is no scar tissue from such a procedure. So tomorrow I am having a saline sono and then on Monday I am having an HSG.

Then on Tuesday, which will be CD11, I go back into the office for more bloodwork and ultrasound monitoring. Depending on how things are going that day-- if a follicle is maturing, etc, they may trigger my ovulation so my husband and I can time intercourse appropriately (which has never been an issue, really, but it never hurts to have more certainty, right?) and then following ovulation my hormones will be monitored again and I believe I will be supplemented with progesterone. 

So this is all really exciting to me. In my heart of hearts I believe that all I really need is progesterone supplementation since everything else about my cycle seems so completely normal, but I'm happy to be taking the opportunity now to identify or rule out any other obvious issues that could be impeding pregnancy, and I'm happy that with all the monitoring I'll be getting, I'll have a window into what my reproductive system is doing this cycle. 

For obvious reasons, this office doesn't allow children, so we left my daughter with my husband's best friend, who took her with him to work. (Hubby and his BFF work together and hubby takes daughter to work from time to time so shes familiar with the environment and she thinks of BFF as her uncle so it was all in all a fun morning for her.) After I picked her up at the office, I decided to treat her to a cake pop for being such a trooper for adapting so easily to such a weird change in her routine. Plus I wanted a PSL. It was very busy in there, so she and I sat down on a couch and enjoyed our treats, and a lady there made some idle chitchat with me about my daughter and about her (obnoxious) desire to be a grandmother. Then she asked me the question I was completely not anticipating: ""Is she your only child?""

I've had that question a couple of other times and I've always just said ""yes"" because I didn't want to get into my sob story at the library or the Chick fil A playplace or whatever. But for whatever reason, maybe just because I felt ready to talk about it and more hopeful for a successful pregnancy in the future, I answered, ""Actually, we had a son in May. But he was stillborn."" And the woman looked surprised, and then apologized. And then of course the conversation came to a screeching halt because that's just how this goes. But it didn't make me uncomfortable this time. I just sat there sipping my coffee and letting that lady feel uncomfortable all by herself. Maybe she'll consider it a little more if she's hounding her kids for them to start procreating...

Post-mortem results day. The consultant started out by saying there wasn't a known cause of his death, then went into further detail.
He was a perfectly normal baby (apart from being dead, I guess). The main point he raised was that his weight and height measurements were in line with a baby at 39 weeks gestation. He died at 34 weeks and was born at 35, so he was very large. The results said his size was in line with what they'd expect from uncontrolled gestational diabetes.

The blood tests they did on me in the hospital and just after birth were within normal ranges (though at the high end of normal) - so they don't have clinical evidence that it was the cause of death, but the consultant said they would keep a very close eye on me in that regard in any future pregnancy, with regular growth scans and tests. I'll also get testing strips and monitor my own blood sugar levels in any future pregnancy and keep a much closer eye on my diet (HG was a bitch and I struggled to eat). My 3hr gestational diabetes test at 24 weeks came back with extremely good results.
He also said he had a hypocoiled umbilical cord. There is an increased rate of stillbirths associated with this, plus stunted foetal growth - but there was no evidence of growth issues. He also said a large number of babies are born healthily with this, so it isn't a definitive cause of death.

So...that's it. He basically died from lack of oxygen, but nobody knows why. The consultant said he doesn't believe I'll have an issue in a future pregnancy. He said I'll be monitored closely and they'll be able to work with me to ensure my anxiety levels are managed.

Can you get a copy of your son's autopsy report? It might go into more detail than your doctor did? 

With the gestational diabetes point...I was never diagnosed, and they still don't have any evidence that I had it. I'm overweight, but don't have an obese BMI. I had the 3hr glucose tolerance test at 24 weeks and the results were great, so I didn't have any more tests. So I didn't follow a gestational diabetes diet or anything like that because I was told I was all clear. They had me take the test because both my parents are diabetic and that would've increased my chances of developing it. The doctor said tests were taken just after birth on certain haemaglobin levels to see if gestational diabetes was present. Again, this test was within normal parameters, though at the high end of normal. So while there isn't any definitive evidence that I had GD, George being so large does point towards it being a potential factor. Basically full term size at 34 weeks. Next time I think they're going to pay close attention to this...or I'll fucking make them :D

UGH. I am so sorry, Rainbow. I am sorry you have no answers because it makes it so much more maddening. But I am so happy to hear you got results and spoke with them. Did they say specifically that he 'died from a lack of oxygen?' I really think that's what happened to my son (because, otherwise, why die?) but I was never even told that. 

Did you have gestational diabetes? Re this: > The results said his size was in line with what they'd expect from uncontrolled gestational diabetes.

I've read that a lot of stillborn babies are under the 'average' weight but who actually knows. What's average, really? 

> Honestly...I'm kinda ok with this. I know I couldn't have done anything differently. I'll just make sure if I get pregnant again they keep a close eye on me and the baby and hope for the best.

You have the right attitude. This is how I feel about being more closely monitored another time around. I will make sure NSTs are done at the end twice a week or whenever I ask for one. They never did that with me after they gave me steroid shots at 34 weeks & put me on bedrest - which I, to this day, will never understand why.

I am so sorry for the loss of your darling George. I hope you feel somewhat better (I know, what is 'better' in this situation?) at having some answers/a report done. Many people opt out of the post-mortem as a personal choice. I almost didn't do it but am so glad I did. I had to know.

All of my bloodwork came back normal-- FSH levels, thyroid, etc. She checked my chart on Fertility Friend and was pleased with my temperatures and that I am ovulating normally. And apparently she doesn't care that I have only one tube. She said I may have gotten pregnant before with just the one tube.

What she is really concerned about is my husband's sperm. He had a count of only 3 million, with below average motility and morphology. She was very sympathetic because my husband admitted he has been smoking and drinking ALOT more than before our son died, to cope with his death. This is something he never admitted before. She said she cannot imagine having lost a child and she obviously understands his need to console himself with these habits, but sperm-wise he really needs to stop them. 

They are going to give him a repeat test end of this month. If it's a faulty test and his count improves dramatically, then I am going to have a minor procedure to unblock my right tube and we will keep trying naturally. If his sperm remains super low, then we are going straight to IVF. His count is too low for IUI. And if we do IVF, she doesn't care about my blocked tube, because IVF doesn't require any tubes at all.

That's the plan. I had an extremely emotional day full of crying and a mini argument with my husband. He thinks he can always approach things rationally and like he's my
Therapist. He kept asking me why I'm upset that my sister is pregnant, telling me it ""has nothing to do with us"" and ""it's not connected to Riyad"" and that when he found out months ago that my SIL is pregnant he was just so happy for his brother and not sad like I was. I got incredibly frustrated with him and felt like I was defending myself for just being sad. I told him that there's nothing wrong with me being sad about losing our son, and of COURSE I'm still upset about it. I told him this past year was tough. He said something like ""well keep being sad about him, let's see where that's gonna take us in life.""

Sooooo I left him to go to bed and just cry. And he came to me and hugged me and cried, too. He said this year WAS tough, and that he feels like he just has to put on a strong face for me. admitted how sad he is over our son and his dad. How he misses them too but he just wants me to be happy. It really touched me because sometimes while we're grieving we tend to discount our loved ones' grief, and he's been hiding it from me to try to keep our relationship strong.

We both needed that because today is a much better day. I don't want to wait for another sperm analysis though. I want to just jump to IVF now if that's our best chance. But my husband wants to wait and build his count. I want to be considerate of his feelings too.

So...that's it. He basically died from lack of oxygen, but nobody knows why. The consultant said he doesn't believe I'll have an issue in a future pregnancy. He said I'll be monitored closely and they'll be able to work with me to ensure my anxiety levels are managed.

I hope you get some answers.

What they told me was that since ther was no cause found/nothing wrong (ok then why did my son die then? - I don't buy that he just randomly croaked - there is ALWAYS a reason), that this means that in the future the likelihood of it happening is low.

I was given 3 options:

1. wait it out, miscarry naturally at home in an undetermined amount of time (it was determined that growth stopped around 6.5w, and I was 10.5w at the time).
1. Take misoprostol to induce contractions, *probably* miscarry at home within a few hours to a few days.
1. D&C that same day.

I personally knew that I needed it to be done as soon as possible so I could grieve.  I also knew that #1 and #2 could require #3 down the line if they weren't successful, so I opted for #3.  

I took the rest of the week off (edited to add: this all happened on a Tuesday, I was home by 9:30pm).  I didn't need it physically, but emotionally I needed that time with my DH, watching all of the Harry Potter movies and cooking together.  I had no pain until ~5 days later, when I had some intense cramping and passed a bunch of large clots (of course, his parents were visiting for dinner at the time - just my luck!)  Pain wise, it was bearable with just 1 tylenol #2 and a slice of apple pie with ice cream, but I was just passing the clots that formed in the few days after the D&C and were trapped in my cervix.  

I've had one follow-up appointment with my primary care doc, she suggested waiting 2-3 months... but that just isn't happening for us.

My midwife gave me the green light to call the fertility specialist last week when she realized just how short my luteal phases are-- she said that she thought that might be worth looking into now rather than waiting until the 6 month point. I decided to wait until I got my period this cycle (hoping that it wouldn't come) but since it came Saturday after a 7 day luteal phase, I called this morning, and surprisingly enough, got an appointment to meet with the doctor on Thursday-- he had a cancellation. I'm going in tomorrow morning for bloodwork so that they have the CD2-4 bloodwork, then on Thursday I'll bring my charts, meet with the doc, and explain the situation.

I'm nervous about this appointment for a few reasons-- first of all, I'm only 4 months out from my stillbirth.

Also, I've actually met with this doctor before-- a couple years ago, right after we moved to town. I needed a doc to monitor my thyroid levels, as those had a role to play in the chemical pregnancies I had the first time I TTCed. He left such a bad taste in my mouth that when I got pregnant with Sam I found another endocrinologist to monitor me throughout pregnancy because I didn't like the RE.

He was kind of a dick and had really bad bedside manner so when I called today I had planned on requesting an appointment with the other doctor but when the receptionist told me that the one I saw before had an opening this week I decided the sooner the better.

Alexis and I are sheltering at my parents' house for Hurricane Irma. Our area was not ordered to evacuate. We have lots of supplies and are ready to ride the storm out. My husband is back at our house with our four pets and preparing the house for the storm. I miss him so freaking much.

I promise to give a more in-depth birth story that includes baby tax when I get more time, but right now my time is full of feedings, changings, and pumping and I love it because my rainbow is here and she's the best thing I've ever seen.

I hope everything is going well for everyone here. Love and miss you all and thank you so much for all the support. <3

I would look for answers, we are very comforted that we won't need any  extra management in the future. Also, it's nice knowing that we're basically a healthy young couple. Also as feel freed to get our adoption homestudy going and get started on that -- we'd always wanted to adopt but wasn't sure where that would fit in and now we know :)

How many losses have you had? We've had six (we've basically gotten pregnant within a few cycles after each loss), and are now pregnant with our seventh, which seems to be progressing well (praying so hard it will continue).

To be honest, it is a relief to know that it's chromosomal. We had never done much to achieve pregnancy, but, after the 5th miscarriage, my wife was taking metformin because her doctor was worried she had PCOS (although she never actually had any cysts and had regular cycles, but we were desperate). We also had gone on this crazy 'clean' diet. We gave all that up after we found out and just let nature take its course.

If you do have a paracentric inversion (that's us), the good news is that your expected number of successful pregnancies is actually about the same as those without. A balanced translocation or pericentric inversion is slightly different as it raises the risk of unbalanced embryos (and thus a special needs child). On the other hand, it's kind of cool, as inversions are a major source of genetic variance.

I saw the lab results and it said it was a ""common familial variant."" But no to answer your question, I don't understand it. Feel free to send me resources if you have any.

Sure. So all inversions are linked to miscarriage, unless they're homozygous. 

So basically, each cell in your body has two chromosomes -- one from your mom, one from your dad. When you make your own gamete, these two chromosomes mix themselves up, and half of the result is randomly thrown out. This process is meiosis and it results in a cell with half the genetic information as you. When combined with a cell from your spouse, this makes a new person.

The problem with inversions is the part where the chromosomes mix themselves up. In normal chromosomes, the chromosomes pair up and just swap DNA. With one inverted and one normal chromosome, one chromosome may 'flip' during the pairing up, and then DNA is swapped in the wrong places, resulting in gametes with wrong DNA. When a conception occurs with this gamete, you either miscarry (usually presents as recurrent loss) or the baby cannot implant since it's missing the DNA to do so (and you believe yourself infertile, even though you've conceived many times).

All inversions have this problem, including the familial ones. In particular, there's an incredibly common inversion on chromosome 9 in Eastern Europe, and although it doesn't affect fecundity (number of offspring), it absolutely does present as repeat loss and infertility.

There are two types of inversions -- paracentric and pericentric. I don't know which your husband has, but the following two youtube videos explain the difference and possible outcomes.

I mean your doctor is just wrong. My wife has an inversion on chromosome 13, and it's absolutely linked to recurrent loss (look at my flair...) and potentially infertility, depending on how big the break is. I would highly suggest another doctor.

Do you understand what it means to have a chromosomal inversion? Honestly, I think you should only be talking with a geneticist at a university or research hospital. Most doctors don't really understand chromosomal rearrangements.

But, ultimately, you have a very good chance of having a living child. I'm sorry you're finding yourself here.

I would recommend joining the Balanced Translocation support group on facebook (just search it in the search bar). Although slightly different to a translocation, there aren't many with diagnosed inversions out there, and the outcomes are similar enough. There are a few couples with inversions on that board.

I was on the add on list for surgery so it was a lot of waiting around and being hungry. I was told to arrive around 9 but surgery did t happen until 4 or so and took about a half hour from when I went under to when I woke in recovery.

I sat outside the OR and my regular gyn was oncall so that was great. My anesthesiologist came over too and chatted about how I tolerate anesthesia. I mentioned I usually get a bit nauseated so she added something to the mix (I woke up feeling great!). I walked in and got on the bed. We joked a little (it was all ladies!) and then I got put under. 

Woke up in recovery. Felt good. Was monitored for a little but I wasn't groggy or sick so moved quickly to another room where I could see my husband. I said I was hungry and they brought me a bunch of food and drinks. 

I was given some mesh undies and pads and my clothing and shown to the washroom. Got dressed. Stole extra mesh panties for my next pregnancy (ü§∑üèº‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è).

I can share what happened with my D&C for missed miscarriage at 12.5 weeks, back in March. 

The procedure itself was absolutely dead easy for me anyway. It was under general anesthesia (which is GOOD) - they stuck an IV in my hand and pumped in the anesthetic and felt a wave of pain going up my arm which was the anesthetic, and then went instantly unconscious (anesthesia feels like the best sleep you've ever had).  Woke up in the recovery room with hardly any pain. They let me slowly wake up and monitored blood pressure for a bit, removed the IV, gave me some food and drink and I walked out of the hospital and got a taxi home.  I was bleeding even less heavy than a period afterwards, but still bled lightly for a couple weeks at least. I took the day of the procedure off and the day after but I was active at home all day and had no physical issues whatsoever.  I didn't take a single painkiller (they only instructed on taking paracetamol and ibuprofen if I needed it, but it was not needed).  

What was far worse than anything physical was the emotional and psychological toll the next day (crying at everything and couldn't sleep whatsoever). However you've already expelled most of the tissue at this point and this will probably not be so much an issue for you, as this is from hormones dropping and yours have likely already dropped quite a bit already. On the other hand I was sky high full-on hormones at 12.5 weeks when I went in for my D&C and just had a total crash after the sudden removal of everything.  Wish I had been warned about THAT...anyway I had the D&C on Thursday and was back to work on Monday, which despite being totally 100% fine physically, I could have used another week to be a crying mess at home and catch up on sleep.

As for TTC, I've only conceived from IUIs but waited until the first period after the D&C to start again with the first MC.  Problem was, that ""period"" (which happened about 4.5 weeks after the D&C) was weird and too light and had no cramps, so I'm not sure it was really a period, plus my HCG level was still around 5.  That IUI cycle went really strangely.  Like follicles grew more slowly and I had less mature (only one) than all my other IUI cycles, and the cycle did fail, although insemination was also done at a shitty time. 

I MC'd again early last month and this time I'm waiting out two cycles before going back to treatments, but I'll likely be doing IVF which is even more expensive to screw up so want to make sure everything is fine for that. I took mifepristone first and then misoprostol for this one (which worked and didn't need D&C) but still waiting for my period now 5 weeks later.  It looked like I only ovulated last week on a diagnostic ultrasound, so probably at least another week before it shows up.

I've had 3 D&Cs, and only one was with anesthesia. The first two were done in the procedure room at my GYN's office. The nurse hooked me up to an IV and gave me something for anxiety I think. I wish I could say it did anything. She asked me if I had any preferences for music and put on the Pandora station of my choice. As the procedure time got a little closer, they kicked my husband out, gave me zofran for nausea, and something for pain - fentanyl maybe? Of course the doctor was delayed, which meant that everything started to wear off. When she came in they put my legs in the thigh stirrups and got started. If you're awake like I was, you'll feel a lot of pressure and a LOT of cramping. Like the worst day of your period but instead of spread out over the day, all at once. It was awful, honestly. I was moaning a bit and they asked if I wanted more narcotics. I hadn't realized that was a choice, so I agreed. 5 min later I asked for even more. I almost puked but they can only hand out narcotics like candy - the zofran was a one and done deal. The whole thing only took about 5 or 6 minutes but it felt like a fucking eternity. I think the narcotics finally caught up *after* it was over because I remember closing my eyes and them telling me I needed to keep breathing. I was thinking ""bitch I am breathing, it's all good!"" but my oxygen level set off the machine so they had to give me the mask. Oops. That happened a second time so I had to stay put for a while, but they did bring my husband in and it was nice to have him there. All in all, it was one of the shittier experiences I've had, but it was thankfully over relatively quickly. I was pretty nauseated the rest of the day, but in terms of pain it was mostly cramping and managed with ibuprofen.

My third D&C was done at my RE clinic, which has a proper surgical suite and an anesthesiologist on site. I showed up about an hour early and they gave me better drugs. I remember asking for something for anxiety and it actually helped a little. They did the standard looking you over before surgery - asked about crowns or dentures, looked at my throat to make sure they could get a tube down there if necessary, etc. The doctor told me they always do an ultrasound before they start the D&C just to be 100% sure the fetus is non-viable, and asked if I would prefer to be awake or asleep for that. When it was time, they wheeled me from pre-op to the OR and I had to move to the table. I wanted to be asleep ASAP, so they knocked me out. I wasn't even awake for them to position my legs for the procedure, which was great. I woke up in recovery and stayed there about an hour. The post op was about the same - a little cramping that was well managed with ibuprofen. 

In terms of recovery afterwards, 2 of my D&Cs happened to be on Fridays, so I just moped around the house the following weekend. I did attend a backyard/casual wedding the day after the third one, and just sat when I needed to. The Thursday D&C (one of the awake ones) was also not so bad that I had to take off work - I went back the next day and just took it easy. I think after my first D&C I ran and lifted a couple of times that week, though I had been pretty active that pregnancy and just didn't push myself too hard. Listen to your body - you'll know what you can tolerate and what you can't. 

If you have questions please feel free to ask. I genuinely hope that they knock you out for your procedure, but if they don't you'll get through it. It's kind of traumatic and really sucks to be awake, but is over relatively quickly. You can also ask if they can send the tissue for analysis.

After that I was sensitive down there for about two weeks. Re: work, yes, I&#39;d take off at least a day or two. Re: clots- mine were normal period size and it only lasted for about 2 days. Nothing the size of m/c ones. Overall it went as well as it could have. It was very expensive though. I wish they would have warned me about that.  I hope yours goes good too. It will be ok. I promise. I&#39;m so sorry you are going through this. </p>

<p>editing to add: in my discharge papers it said no lifting over 25lbs for 2 weeks.</p>

I had general anaesthetic for my D&C.  I found it pretty hard to wake up properly when I came round afterwards - I just wanted to lie there and be drowsy.

I don&#39;t want to take anything away from him so I just lean into his unicorn side.  </p>

I just came back from an appointment with my midwife to discuss how I'm doing on the Zoloft. 

While I was there I brought up my super short luteal phases again. My midwife seemed surprised and was like, ""oh I didn't know they were THAT short!""

(Granted, that was a different midwife... but still, she said she'd note it on my chart.) When I saw MY midwife last time, I'm not totally sure if I stressed just how short my luteal phases were, but today when I explained just how my cycles had been looking, she said that that seemed short even for normal postpartum recovery, so she told me to go ahead and call the RE in town.  They're already closed for the day, so I can call in the morning but I'm also debating whether to wait until my next cycle just so I have more complete information as to how my first three postpartum cycles shook out. 

I'm just SO irritated. The reason I need anxiety medication is because I am so fucked up over the fact that my luteal phases are so damn short that I have no idea when to expect my period and barely have a prayer of expecting a pregnancy. I feel like if she had said, ""Okay let's start with progesterone"" then maybe we could have held off on the freaking Zoloft.

I feel a little nervous about it, but also excited to share the news. Telling my step-daughters will be soooo fun, but I&#39;m scared about how they&#39;ll handle the news if something goes wrong. They are 3 and 7, so a miscarriage would be a hard thing to explain. </p>

<p>Today I ordered the sneak peek test. I miss that first time pregnancy feeling of pure excitement. Now I feel like every excited feeling comes along with a feeling of dread and chastising myself for getting excited too early. </p>
