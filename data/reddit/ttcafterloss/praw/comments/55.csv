* FOOD: gift cards for places that deliver are great. If your'e actually bringing food, do it in throwaway containers so they don't have to do dishes or keep track or your dish.
* BOOZE: if she‚Äôs a drinker, a nice bottle of her fave. 
* STUFF: adult coloring book, a journal to write in, a gift card for a mani/pedi or massage...and I like ‚Äúcomfort stuff‚Äù like cozy socks/tea/etc. 
* Personally I don‚Äôt like receiving flowers. Because they die. And I‚Äôd like to pick my own jewelry and knick knacks so remembrance pieces are really personal. But if you want to, a candle holder and candle are a nice idea. 
* A card is nice...especially with a personal note where you acknowledge her loss as a real loss/big deal. And use the baby's name.
* Remember the date...and remember Mother's Day in regards to her
* Realize that people may rally around her/them right now, but that support fades quickly and her pain won't. So checking in often is nice...especially down the road. 
* When checking in, don't expect a reply. Even let her know you don't expect one with a ""I'm going to check in every so often so you know I'm here and can talk to if you want to, but don't feel the need to reply.""
* If you have kids or are pregnant, please realize that she likely will be sad/hurt around the kids or pregnant people. Its not personal and it may get better as time passes. But either stop talking about your kids/pregnancy or give it a bit of time and then ASK HER how she wants to handle it. I've been left off friend's kid's birthday invites because they thought it would hurt me...and I likely wouldn't have gone but having the choice taken from me was hurtful, too. Like I have a plague. 
* No platitudes like ‚ÄúI know it will happen next time‚Äù or ‚Äúeverything happens for a reason‚Äù etc. These are just bullshit.

She was happy to refer me to an RE, though.  

In my previous miscarriage experiences, my only complaint about the midwives I saw was that they tended to be much more ""hopeful"" when it seemed clear that the pregnancy was gone, whereas when I finally saw an OB, they were much more realistic.  This could just be because time had passed and they had more information, though.  

At the office I go to, both midwives and OBs are happy to provide progesterone after one or two losses.  My RE doesn't see a reason to.  So, I think progesterone supplements will be relatively easy for you to get if you want them.

The nurse explained a little to me and my OB came in and talked to me about all of my options in depth, scheduled me for a follow up ultrasound a week later, and a follow up appointment a couple hours after that.

Obviously, there are going to be times when your OB isn't available, but usually those types of places have emergency appointment times that they keep empty just in case of stuff like this happening.

As for a midwife.... Im not sure where you live,  but I personally would not trust my care to a midwife living in the United States. They are usually not prepared for anything going wrong which includes miscarriage (if that's what you're worried about) and complications during pregnancy and birth. If you live outside of it, you may have better luck.

As for progesterone, you can ask that they test yours. There's no reason to take it if your progesterone isn't low to begin with, but there's really no proof that it helps at all anyways. Studies showed absolutely no difference in pregnancy outcomes, but some doctors will prescribe it because they figure it doesn't hurt.

You are super unlikely to get any testing after one CP and a MMC. That's not to trivialize your loss. It sucks, I went through the same, but that's how I know. CPs are considered par for the course and do not generally count towards your loss total with a doctor. They'll note it, but you need two miscarriages after 6 or so weeks for most places to test you and some require 3.

I am so sorry for your friend.  I had a late second trimester loss and also gave birth to my son after he had passed, so I have a small idea of what your friend is going through.

Offer condolences.  Even if it's just, ""I don't know what to say.  I'm so sorry.""

Only when we were leaving the hospital were we given bereavement materials from the hospital, which included that we should have done after the birth.  Luckily, I sought this out for myself, and we made some quick decisions.  But your friend might not have this opportunity.  

A lot of the advice relates to memory making.  At first, we were somewhat uncomfortable the idea of holding our dead baby, taking photos, getting footprints made, etc..  But when the time came, I loved holding my baby.  And I'm so glad to have all the photos and video of him now.  

If your friend still has to give birth, perhaps look online to see if the hospital or a local volunteer organization in her area like [Now I Lay Me Down To Sleep](https://www.nowilaymedowntosleep.org/) offers professional photographers to photograph the baby and the family after the birth.  Technically, this was available to us, but again, it wasn't mentioned to us until it was too late to arrange, and I hadn't been able to find this info myself.  

If you find something, pass the info to your friend or her husband, and ask if it's something they're interested in, and if they'd like you to help set something up.  Your friend and her husband may feel that the time they have with their baby after the birth is too intimate, and they don't want an outsider there.  But some people appreciate having nice professional photos of their baby and their family. For themselves, and also for when they want to share their baby with friends and family down the road.  If it's something they want, and they ask you to set it up, then coordinate with her husband from there.  

People often say that it hurts that friends and family seem to forget their losses as time passes.  So right now, put the date she learned the news, and/or her delivery date in your calendar, with a yearly notification, just as you would other important dates (birthdays, anniversaries).   When the anniversary comes, let you know that you remember her child, and are thinking of them.  Or even plan a visit for a memorial.

Beyond that, I'd say just keep showing up.  She might not reply to a message.  She might go AWOL for few weeks without being in touch.  Don't take it personally.  This will go on for months.  Just keep checking in, and let her know it's okay.

A general rule for women after losses is that all things baby is upsetting.  Even announcements of pregnancies can be upsetting.  Announcements can't be 100% avoided.  However photos of the pregnancy tests or ultrasounds, talk of how ""we're safe now that it's the 2nd trimester"" or even just how the pregnancy is going, invitations to baby showers or gender reveal parties, talk of being a new mom, complaints about lack of sleep or....even talk about toddler milestones.  All very upsetting.  Let people in your friend group know that they should avoid sending these things her way until she says she's okay with it.  
  
One of the most common sources of conflict and hurt is family or friends not understanding this, and pushing these things on these women anyway, because making these accommodations puts a damper on their own pregnancy experiences.  (And a variety of this is holding off for a period of time, and then telling women they should ""get over it""...not recognizing everyone grieves at their own pace.)  So support her in this.

Although women don't want to hear about other people's babies, but at some point, they **_do_** generally want to talk about their own baby.  They want people to know him or her, to recognize they they lived and died.  They want people to use their child's name.  They want to know that they aren't the only ones who remember their child.  So don't be afraid to talk about the baby.  People are afraid that they're going to remind us of our loss (as if we don't remember every day) or that we're going to cry (as if we don't cry anyway).  

Beyond that, see if your library has a book on stillbirth, or if not that, losses after a prenatal diagnosis.  It's hard to understand what this is like, if you haven't gone through it yourself.  But hopefully reading about other people's experiences will help you see that however your friend and her husband deal with their grief, she's not unusual.   And you can validate her in that.

The calendar stuff is shitty.  In early November, we'd gotten good 20-wk news.  We weren't that far away from worrying more about a premie than a loss.

Our pediatric cardiologist was telling us about short-term concerns (developmental delays) and long-term concerns (depression), I was thinking about how I was going to parent through that.  

And then we found out that the heart problems weren't isolated, and our son had a very rare congenital disease, and a very poor prognosis.  We felt like the only thing left we could offer him was a good death.  

And just like that, I went from thinking that 2018 would be consumed with my baby, to 2018 being a complete void.  And yes, not being pregnant again yet means it will be at least 2019 before we might have a baby again.  If we don't suffer another loss.  

All the things I thought I couldn't do work-wise, travel-wise in 2018 are now back on the table.  (In a sad way.)  I feel like I should plunge full steam ahead with career stuff until there's at least another due date on the horizon...but I have zero enthusiasm for it right now.

And one after a heartbeat!  I'm very sorry this is what you're going through.   

I haven't read a lot about CP, but here's my two cents about your questions. Until very recently, HPT's couldn't detect chemical pregnancies.  The experience of a CP was someone's cycle being a little late.  They didn't know they'd lost a pregnancy.  They only knew they'd had a MC when they had a clinical pregnancy.  

Because of this, I think a lot of our understanding of MC come from clinical pregnancies--and underestimates how common it is.  There was one detailed study done years ago that estimated a 20% miscarriage rate for clinical pregnancies....but that number didn't count an additional 25% of pregnancies that were lost before they were clinical (chemical pregnancies).  Overall about 40% of pregnancies detected at 6 DPO ended in CP or MC.  That's getting close to every other pregnancy.  

The main thing that's changed today is that HPT's have almost caught up to the research lab pregnancy tests....so now we all know not only about our clinical miscarriages, but also our CP's.  (Thanks a lot, science!)  What you are going through is devastating, but you are far from alone.  There's still very good reason for you to hopeful.

The things you can control, like others said, are related to the environment, i.e. your body.  Most of these things you're probably already familiar with from the ttc chapters of pregnancy books: take your vitamins, cut down on tobacco, alcohol, caffeine, 420, etc.  Avoid sources of listeria, toxoplasmosis, salmonella, etc.  Avoid skin care products like Accutane, anti-acne cleansers containing benzoyl peroxide, and anti-wrinkle treatments containing retinoids.

The other thing that might help for very early pregnancy is  management of inflammation.  Research studies are starting to turn up evidence that things like taking baby aspirin, flossing daily, etc. can help women get pregnant, and the theory is that the embryo might have an easier time implanting and getting established when mom's immune system isn't rev'd up.

You're technically 3w 3d. Most doctors don't believe women can track their ovulation, so they stubbornly stick with LMP until you get an early scan, when they might adjust it if it's more than a few days off. Some women (self included) calculate a fake, later LMP date to tell the doctor that matches up to if your ovulation was on CD14. That way your dates are more accurate from the start, and a few days starts to matter on the other side when you're looking at possible inductions etc.

Wishing you a smooth and healthy 9 months .

As for trying again...do it when it feels right for you. If you wanna wait 3 cycles. Do it.

I was saying things like ‚ÄúI think we should come back to your mom or dad,‚Äù and ‚Äúwe‚Äôre getting pretty far away now.‚Äù</p>

<p>Eventually I caught up and grabbed their little arm (lightly) and looked into the most terrified little eyes. Screaming ensued (not my own) while I picked this child up in the most awkward carry to bring them back to my store. Dad noticed when we were in earshot and ran over to me apologizing and calmed his child down to the point where they were able to leave without more of a scene. I could not stop laughing. </p>

<p>I still can‚Äôt stop laughing! I know full well that given my husband‚Äôs and my personalities (and having heard stories of husband as a child who should have been leashed), if we ever end up with living children, they will likely need to be on leashes because they‚Äôll probably be the sort to wander off.</p>

<p>In other news, I‚Äôm down 20 pounds from my pre-pregnancy weight. I am not totally sure why or how. I haven‚Äôt really done anything different food-wise (maybe it‚Äôs because I‚Äôve added yogurt and a supplement called ‚ÄúJuice Plus‚Äù to my diet but I doubt it), I still drink too much Mountain Dew and not enough water... but my clothes are super baggy and the scale doesn‚Äôt lie.</p>

For what it's worth, unless there is some major complication, there is no real medical need to wait, once the miscarriage is complete. Especially with an earlier loss, you can typically start trying again immediately. Even with our later loss, our doctor put up no resistance to trying as soon as my wife's cervix was fully closed (then again, maybe she's just sick of us getting pregnant, haha).

That's a frustrating struggle. I would also recommend Psychology Today, or checking your insurance directory if you haven't already.

As for music, I can't listen to anything too happy or too sad. I have been listening to lots of gospel music, because I find that spiritually nourishing. Something meditative might be good too. I know it sounds weird but Gregorian chants can be really calming and help you to kinda zone out and not feel much.

It sounds terrible, but forcing yourself to do stuff is good. When I told my mom about the MC, she shared advice from her late mother, who had two miscarriages and was widowed twice (in her 20s and again in her 70s). My grandmother said that she made herself go out and do things, to stay distracted. She also made herself care about other people's problems, even if they seemed like small potatoes, because caring for others was a good redirection of energy. And she had another (chilling, but accurate) nugget of wisdom: if you withdraw and wait until you're ready to socialize and go out again, people will have moved on. Either from your pain or from the relationship entirely.

So a long walk was a good decision. And I hope the charity dinner or another activity might serve as distraction some day <3

I know what that's like.  So very sorry for your losses.   

Our loss happened in late November.  We were also cleared to start TTC after about 6 weeks, and I wanted to start trying again as soon as was practical, but it's taken some time for my body to get back it's equilibrium.  

I knew that right after pregnancy, my cycles would likely be less predictable than normal, so this time, I've started temping and using OPKs.  

My first 3 cycles post-loss were so different from when we were TTC last time. Cycles shorter, periods lighter (and early on, more spotting).  CD1 was harder to determine 'cause I was getting pre-menstrual spotting that I'd never gotten before.  (Usually, when it starts, it starts medium-to-heavy.)  The OPKs darkened, but never got dark enough to indicate ovulation (though temperature did go up in one case).  Who knows what my body was doing?  Despite this, we did TTC last month, but without success.

This is my fourth cycle post-loss, and it's the first one where it feels like my body might be getting back to its former self.  The OPKs got a positive result this time (+ change in temp).  Timing indicates this cycle will be closer to ""normal"" length (if not over-correcting and going a couple days long).  

So if it takes some time for your body to get back to normal, you're not alone.  It's kind of blah when you just want to conceive, but I've used the time to take care of my body and get it ready for pregnancy again.  In it's own way, it makes me feel like I'm doing something and moving forward.

You're totally right about managing other people's feelings. I've found myself in the weird situation of consoling others about my loss many times. Whatever.

The best thing about my body is that, for whatever reason, I don't show that much until the last 6 weeks or so. I am tall, so baby goes...somewhere...for the majority of the pregnancy, before popping. I also work from home, so I don't have a whole office full of people to deal with.

I start speaking and then the waterworks come, you know how it is. So I was going to email it to him tomorrow while at work just explaining why I‚Äôm struggling, then he‚Äôd have time to process it and would understand what I‚Äôm feeling without me having to struggle with words. I‚Äôm not very eloquent at that sort of thing.

But when I got back home I sat on the bed in my current ‚Äòlistless‚Äô fashion, and he said ‚Äòtell me‚Äô. And as usual I started welling up and instead of leaving me alone, he just let me cry it out. And THEN during like ten minutes of me sobbing, he tells me all the things HE‚ÄôS feeling. How he‚Äôs sad, how he‚Äôs worried about me, how he KNOWS it‚Äôs going to happen for us, how he‚Äôs been researching miscarriage and ‚Äòit‚Äôs common you know!‚Äô And he starts feeling off facts about 1 in 5 and that‚Äôs only REPORTED pregnancies and all this other stuff. And  then I suddenly just started talking. I told him everything I‚Äôd written in the letter and all my concerns, stupid or not, even the fact that the due date was Halloween and I was so sure it was ‚Äòmeant to be‚Äô.

I feel better. I didn‚Äôt realise how he was feeling and I always bottle things up (it‚Äôs the British way). My dad died last January and I don‚Äôt speak about it and I only cried when alone.

He‚Äôs always there to catch me when I fall, and he‚Äôs done his research to find out facts to try and help me. I‚Äôm so lucky in so many ways.

CD 23 today. CM is gone. I&#39;m always hungry, I ate more than DH yesterday. My breakfast today could have fed two people. Maybe it&#39;s cold outside or something. Or I&#39;m using a lot of energy every day, studying and walking for hours. </p>

<p>I just had this thought, what if I get pregnant again, and lose the baby again in the second trimester? It feels awful to carry it for so long and then lose it. I don&#39;t know if I could take it.</p>

In that field, it's not uncommon for a prospective postdoc to co-author a grant proposal with a PI, which the PI then submits to programs that only they are eligible for (because they have the PI status), in order to get funding for a position.  If you're writing a proposal anyway, and are planning far enough ahead in the funding cycle, it's worth asking if there are other places the PI can submit it (with less stringent requirements for where you are based).

I was (a bit paranoid) wondering if there's a buildup of these tiny waves on a tiny developing brain in embriogenesis (on a molecular level).

I guess my worry comes from the fact my USGs were very.. Strange. The doc couldn't get the baby to move the way he wanted and was dabbing it with the device from all possible angles, pushing it hard into my belly (it hurt). I had to leave the office and come back many times (walk, pee, eat, anything so that the baby would move). We had to have that USG twice. Eventually he managed and everything was supposedly alright then. The baby died a couple of weeks afterwards.

I believe that -- in general -- hospital doppler ultrasounds are approved for *continuous* monitoring.

From personal experience, once you've learned to identify the heartbeat, you cannot mistake it for bowel sounds. You shouldn't try to find the heartbeat *while* you're having a BM :) . But otherwise, you should be fine.

Personally, my wife and I found using a doppler incredibly relieving in our last pregnancy. It gave us peace of mind for at least a day at a time.

I waited until my first period after my MMC and began temping and using OPKs again, but I have been bad with my timing and even though I got a  OPK a member over at TFAB suggested that I didn't ovulate yet this cycle.

Our circumstances were somewhat different from yours, so your mileage may vary.  We lost our son at almost 23 weeks due to a TMFR.  Between the weeks of prenatal diagnosis, the induction, postpartum recovery, and some travel we had planned, we probably didn't have sex for 2 months, all told.  

Once we had the opportunity again, we could have tried to TTC that cycle. But the timing wasn't good, and my husband felt like it might be too soon.  So we just focused on being intimate again, and enjoying the experience, without having to think about anything TTC/baby-related.  And that worked well for us.

By the time the next cycle came around, and we wanted to TTC, it wasn't particularly scary/emotional for us.  I think the period of pre-TTC sex helped, as did the fact that we'd had nearly 2 months after the delivery to deal with our loss.  For me, it was kind of a relief to start TTC again.  But everyone is different.   

In my case, my brain doesn't compute the idea of ""trying to replace"" our son.  He's our first.  The oldest sibling.  Irreplaceable.   It's also common immediately after a loss to just want to be pregnant again.  If you're harboring feelings of guilt about that, I hope you can go easy on yourself and let them go.

As far as conversations with my husband...well, initially, we just spent some time together each day, doing ""grief work"".  We started the day that we got home from the hospital.  

Initially, we'd read about pregnancy loss, the aftermath, and trying again. We'd talk about what we read--whether we identified with it or not.  (The info on how partners can grieve at different paces and in different ways was quite helpful.)  Our materials were geared toward later-term loss and TFMR, but I'm sure you could find similar materials specific to miscarriage.  

We also have gone to a counselor for pregnancy loss, and a parent support group, and that has also helped spark conversations. (And I think the later was helpful for my husband, too, because it's the only place he's encountered other men going through this.) 

It's just kind of been one long, evolving conversation...now we tend to talk just when I'm having a bad day or when I've met with the counselor. (I'm still going on my own.)

After our sixth loss, we found out that one of chromosome 13s is 'inverted' (technically a paracentric inversion). This is really rare and they don't know how it affects anything, but it is a chromosomal abnormality. Some people with inversions have no issues though, and there is really very little research. All the doctors we spoke to after learning this told us our miscarriages were due to this chromosomal issue. They then told us that -- based on their understanding -- we just needed to get lucky with a good pair of gametes. We had never had genetic testing before on the babies, so we just figured they were right.

They also told us that the chromosomes ought to mean we wouldn't be able to get pregnant easily (Like, WTF, really? She'd already been pregnant *6* times after we learned that). Literally a month later we got pregnant again despite not really trying, and made it to the second trimester with normal growth and a heartbeat. Again, the doctors were like 'well this baby looks really great, so you guys got lucky'. We were almost ready to believe this until the baby's heart stopped at 16 weeks. The genetics report found out he was a *normal* baby boy. *Immediately* after learning that *every single doctor* (the same ones that told us the miscarriages were chromosomal and we just needed to get lucky) changed their tune. In our follow-up visits, every one told us that they no longer think chromosomal paracentric inversions cause miscarriage. Basically, they think that if whatever we have can kill a baby overnight at week 16 (we had his heartbeat the day before) then i guess it can kill a baby anytime, but we're no closer to finding out what that is, because literally every single test comes back normal.

I mean, most people associate miscarriage with like major abnormalities in the baby or something, and this most commonly causes death in the first trimester. If the baby is chromosomally normal and has a heartbeat in the second trimester, that's supposed to be the *safest* time ever during the whole pregnancy! Still, people keep telling us it's ""bad luck"". It's like... really?! bad luck!? how shitty can our luck be? Genetically normal babies aren't supposed to die in the second trimester. Even the maternal-fetal specialists we've talked to have been surprised (one even said, he's only seen this a 'handful' of times).

As to how we keep trying? Honestly, I'm not sure how we do it. We have no motivation to prevent pregnancy and the process of getting pregnant is pretty fun, so I guess that's why we do it. Also, we really want a living baby, and there's really no other way to get that other than go through nine months of pregnancy (it's like a cruel joke isn't it!?).

I dunno, this whole experience has really shattered my trust in doctors. I simply don't believe what they say anymore; I just hope the next pregnancy works out.

Pregnancy after loss is so hard, and what you're feeling isn't out of the realm of normal. There are so many emotions to go through, not to mention hormones.

It is entirely possible that it's unrelated, but I had the same thoughts toward the end of pregnancy and they *really* intensified postpartum into full blown PPD and PPA.

I don&#39;t know what&#39;s wrong and I just want someone to tell me I&#39;m not alone. I could not have been happier to find out we were pregnant again, and things are going really well. It&#39;s an &quot;easy&quot; pregnancy as far as symptoms, besides the anxiety. But lately, I just keep thinking &quot;How is this happening? I&#39;m not ready for this. What on Earth was I thinking?&quot; And it&#39;s so bizarre because I couldn&#39;t think of anything but getting pregnant after miscarriage, and this baby is so wanted, but it just doesn&#39;t seem real still and I&#39;m having a really hard time actually picturing a life with her. It&#39;s like there&#39;s some disconnect all of a sudden and it terrifies me that I&#39;m going to fail as a mom somehow. I know this topic sometimes comes up in regular threads, but I feel like after having experienced loss, these are feelings I shouldn&#39;t have. I feel so weird and conflicted about it.

I lost my pregnancy on Sunday morning at 2am. This was my first pregnancy at 5w4d, and although I understand it can happen for unknown reasons, I can‚Äôt stop wondering ‚Äòwhy me?‚Äô I know it‚Äôs early in comparison to some people, and only the first, so in a way I feel guilty for that. 

I know it doesn‚Äôt give me any more rights than others to have a successful pregnancy, but I want to note that I‚Äôve done everything ‚Äòright‚Äô. Healthy eating to a fault, drinking only water, no alcohol or caffeine, early nights, gentle exercise, prenatals, you name it, I did it. Im 32, no fertility related issues (well, that I know of, now I‚Äôm not so sure).

I‚Äôve taken a day off today (Mon) and I‚Äôm not coping well. I keep crying and raging, I guess the hormones aren‚Äôt helping. I cannot stand the thought of going back to work tomorrow, pretending I‚Äôve had a stomach bug and back to the incessant bitching, cliques and unimportant bullshit I usually have to cope with. (The job‚Äôs another issue!) I‚Äôm not sure I‚Äôll be able to keep my emotions locked down if I have to deal with idiot people.

I wanted this baby so bad. It‚Äôs due date was 31st October, the perfect date. I‚Äôd made plans for removing myself from this job after maternity leave. I have to stay in it until I have a baby because the maternity conditions are really worth the pain, and getting another job on this level is massively stressful. And now all
I can think is ‚Äòwell, that‚Äôs another 1 year plus of shit to deal with.‚Äô 

I feel like I‚Äôve let my husband down. His sperm did its job, but my body has failed us. I bought ALL the pregnancy books and now they‚Äôre thrown under the bed in the spare room. I was reading them every day, obsessing about how big he was, how his ears have begun to form, etc. I was revelling in pregnancy, enjoying every moment, even the few symptoms I got. On the day it happened, I was on my phone shopping for maternity wear and thank god I didn‚Äôt order. I had like 50 photos on my phone of my numerous positive pregnancy tests, I stupidly posted all over reddit about pregnancy and joined the appropriate October/November baby bumps subs (which I‚Äôve just left, I can‚Äôt bear the sympathy if I posted about the loss), I‚Äôve got a midwife phoning me today to organise my first appointment. What am I supposed to say? I don‚Äôt want sympathy. I just want it all to go away. 

My whole life was leading up to having that baby. Now what. What‚Äôs the point of going on? I know time is a great healer and all the rest of it but it‚Äôs difficult to see that right now. And how can I not feel bitterness? I want to punch the world in the face. I want people with smiley babies on Facebook to fuck off and stop showing off, inconsiderate assholes. (Don‚Äôt worry, I‚Äôve deleted Facebook now for a while, I do understand in the back of my mind that it‚Äôs not their fault and they‚Äôre not doing it to upset me). 

Some people lose 3+ babies, lose babies way later than me, lose babies after spending thousands on IVF. I know I have a right to feel sad but I should count my blessings because I do have so much good in my life and hey, it could‚Äôve happened later and been a lot worse. 

How do you go about trying again if there‚Äôs a risk of this happening again? How do you not feel resentful about what has happened? And more to the point, how, next time, do you sit and wait for 12/20/40 weeks to pass knowing last time you lost it? I‚Äôve spent the past three weeks since BFP this first pregnancy worrying about the likelihood of miscarriage and guess what? IT FUCKING HAPPENED!!! All the reassurances about symptoms going away and Oh,  it‚Äôs only spotting, and You‚Äôll be fine  were fucking WRONG. I stopped feeling pregnant last Tuesday and on the Saturday night it was over. I was RIGHT. How can I go through that again when my concerns were actually spot on this time? It‚Äôs driving me insane that I could feel those worries again and they could be correct again. 

Thanks for reading the rant and sorry if I sound like a self-pitying jerk. I will delete this if it isn‚Äôt the right place for it.

The way I think about it is: there was a conception, the joining of cells that forms a baby. That joining of cells *is* the baby, just at a very early age. Sometimes something goes wrong and the joining of cells / baby can't develop the way it should, and it dies. This can happen at any stage of a pregnancy... sometimes even very soon after conception, while other aspects of the pregnancy continue to develop for a time, like with us... and it is devastating at any time.  It may well be *more* devastating the later it occurs, and the more baby there is to know and lose... but less devastating is still devastating.    

It's so wrong, but as I'm sure youve already found, people will try to minimize your loss to you in a combination of their own cluelessness and misguided attempts to help. Even women who've experienced loss themselves can say hurtful things (and I hope nothing I wrote felt that way to you). It sucks. All you can do is be prepared for it and try to take it with a bit of grace--or not, and shut them down. Whatever feels less bad to you; you get a pass here.

I'm unfortunately a fairly prolific poster so it's not easy to read through my user history to figure out what happened to me.

I've had a severe case of Asherman's. I had a MMC of twins discovered at 12w; one passed a few days after 9w, the other after 10w. I had a D&C, which supposedly went well. My HCG was still positive by 7 weeks after the miscarriage, and people here urged me to call my doctor. We did weekly blood tests that showed that it was decreasing but holding more steady than it should, so then I finally got an ultrasound over 10 weeks after the first D&C which showed that I had retained placenta that still was connected to my boss supply and making HCG.

So exactly 11 weeks after the first d&c, I had another, with ultrasound guidance. She told me she would just suction it out, but I later learned that the report says she also actually did curettage, which is something you want to avoid doing as much as possible in this kind of situation. Procedure went well, but my period just didn't show. Over 30 days later, my ob prescribe provera, and I did a five day course instead of the full ten. No bleed. I decided to switch offices because we were unhappy with my ob, and the midwives I went to said they thought maybe my period didn't show up because I only did give days instead of ten (five days *really* should be enough for most people and has been sufficient for me since then). So I waited some more, and two and a half months after the second d&c, I finally had a period, but a very, very light one (the entire period wouldn't have filled one small menstrual cup).

My periods continued to be light, and after 2 or 3, I called my midwives, and was told that normal, call back in December (6 months of waiting as first period was in June) if you're not pregnant. I waited another cycle or two, noticed that I was consistently having a lot of pain with my cycles even though they were so light, and called them back again and finally got referred to an ob. The ob/gyn noticed the curettage in the report, and referred me for a saline sonogram.

Another month later, I had the saline sonogram. They couldn't get the catheter in! The radiologist said my cervix might have just been really tight, but it could also mean I had scarring. At this point, I was even more suspicious. My ob/gyn referred me to an RE, and at the same time I started working on getting connected with a specialist in Asherman's. I got the RE appointment about a month later, and the hsg a few weeks later I think. The hsg more clearly demonstrated that I had a tiny pocket right about the cervix that was open, and that's where I was bleeding from, but the rest of my uterus was scarred shut. 

So then I went for a hysteroscopy with someone who is thought to be one of the top two RE specialists in this. And he was only able to do one half of my uterus. He was worried that if he did it all in one go, he was in danger of perforating my uterus. So a couple months later, after a course of 30 days of estrogen and then provera at the end, I went back. The hsg after that surgery showed an open cavity, but still a bit of scarring, so he did a third procedure. Hsg after that one showed improvement, but my uterus is still kind wonky. He wanted to do a fourth, but I was just done. I needed a break. And so I've taken one for nearly a year now. I took a couple cycles completely off, then tried naturally, then tried two femara cycles, and now I'm banking some embryos via IVF. Our plan is to throw the kitchen sink at my uterus and see if I can be successful with a frozen transfer, and if not, I'll use a surrogate.

I did recently repeat an HSG, and between now and my final post surgery HSG, my cavity does expand better, but my lining is still kinda fucked up (it's patchy on lining checks). Waiting to hear what my surgeon thinks.

Again, I'm quite a severe case. Most people only need one procedure, and many of them (at least 2/3) are usually able to go on to have another pregnancy. 

If I were you, I would make an appointment to see an RE, that is at least one week after your last provera pill (ideally 2 weeks so that if it doesn't work, you can say it didn't and move on, but you can still have the first appointment before you know for sure). If it turns out the provera works, great! Go ahead and cancel the appointment. But if it doesn't, then you're lined up to move on. I would not bother with having an ob do a saline sonogram or try to do your hsg unless there is a very long wait to see the RE. I would only let an ob/gyn do a hysteroscopy procedure for this if they have specialized in minimally invasive surgery. You do not need to travel to one of the two REs that the Asherman's community fawns over, as much as they will insist you do. I did because I could afford it and one of them is relatively close to me, and I knew I had a bad case.

Still, I hope that you don't actually have any scarring, and that if you do, it's super mild and easily treatable. :) ",[],,t1_dv71zul,False,0,[],False,"<div class=""md""><p>Hello!

I believe that cervical scarring would be apparent during a cervical exam or when they try to dilate the cervix, so your OB might be able to investigate that at a normal appointment. To diagnose scarring in the uterus, they can do a saline sonohystogram, which is a short procedure where they place a catheter through the cervix, insert a small amount of saline to inflate the uterus, and then take images of the uterus using vaginal ultrasound. There is also a minor surgery called a hysteroscopy where they insert a camera through the cervix to get more detailed images of the uterus.

I&#39;m also terrified that this baby will look just like his big brother and I won&#39;t be able to take care of him. If he survives that long. I hate this.</p>

<p>For now I&#39;m pregnant, baby boy is looking good and I&#39;m doing everything I can to keep him alive. That&#39;s all I&#39;ve got.</p>

Everything turned out fine and I haven‚Äôt had any since. Until last night after I had pooped. When I spotted on Wednesday it was right after I pooped too. I know that pushing too hard can cause spotting, but I have been really trying not to push because I really want to avoid hemorrhoids. And it wasn‚Äôt just a small dot of blood or pinked tinged discharge, it was a full two or three wipes of pink blood. Anywho, now I‚Äôm wondering if I‚Äôm just irritating my cervix while going to the bathroom and the lovenox is exacerbating the bleeding a little. I hope so. It‚Äôs just so hard to see any blood, at any time, but right now is also right when we lost our first baby. Appointment on Thursday, hopefully that will ease my mind some.</p>

Comparing her pictures from last week to this week, her cheeks have gotten much fatter. It‚Äôs amazing to see her grow, even if going in every week is wearing on me.

They‚Äôre still holding out hope that baby won‚Äôt need the NICU because the dose of opioids I‚Äôm taking is so low. That‚Äôs reassuring. So for now, I‚Äôm still at the nice birthplace at the small hospital.

They‚Äôre also talking about taking me out of work sooner rather than later because I‚Äôm able to take fewer pills when I‚Äôm home.

Honestly, I think your doctors are behind the times here. You can have an auto-immune disease without any symptoms.

In their case, their disease only became symptomatic when it almost killed them, so I'm really glad I have that proactive knowledge. The same is true of lupus, APS, rheumatoid arthritis, sjogren's -- you can have no symptoms but still have the antibodies, and those are what cause issues. For all anyone knows, the stillbirths can be the only symptom. I guess my feeling here is -- why put yourself at risk when the tests are so easy and the consequence of not treating so severe?

It usually consists of thyroid testing, progesterone monitoring, auto-immune disease workups, thrombophilia testing, and a detailed look at the uterus.

It is *highly* unlikely that you have lost two babies due to genetics. Here is why.

Firstly, the more losses you have the less likely they are to be genetic. This is true even if you have an abnormal karyotype. The only time this is not true is if you have a robertsonian translocation of complementary chromosomes (like if both of your chromosomes 13 were stuck together). We *know* you don't have this because you have two living children.

Secondly, it is unlikely that any miscarriage in the second trimester is due to genetics. Doctors like to blame chromosomes because it's easy. While it's true that most babies with genetic abnormalities will die in the first trimester, this is not true of the second or third trimester. The vast majority of babies with genetic abnormalities who have a heartbeat in the second trimester will be born alive. It is especially doubtful in your situation due to the tests you've had done earlier in pregnancy.

Personally, I would think genetic issues are very unlikely in your situation, unless you or your husband carry some kind of genetic disease. However, if the baby looked fine on the ultrasound screens, it is unlikely you even have that.

There are other reasons babies hearts stop, and I think it's probably best in your situation (If you decide to try again) to look at those. The most common diagnosed cause of recurrent pregnancy loss (especially late loss) is anti-phospholipid syndrome. This is an acquired auto-immune disease that causes the body's blood to clot randomly. If that clot gets into the placenta, the result is death. Note that acquired does not mean you did something to get it, but rather that you weren't born with it. You can develop APS at any time, including after the births of two healthy children. The treatment for this is blood thinners, and no amount of IVF would help. Similarly, there are other conditions that cause blood to clot. These conditions (called thrombophilias) typically present as random, sudden deaths in later pregnancy. Unlike genetic causes, there is almost never any morphological or developmental problem with the baby.

I'm not saying not to listen to your doctors, but rather that it is premature to jump to genetics and IVF with PGS if you haven't been examined for these other causes. For one thing, having APS or another thrombophilia places you in a high risk group during pregnancy (for maternal harm, not just to the baby). The same is true for other auto-immune diseases. Thankfully, if you get the testing done and treat these conditions, then you can make pregnancy as safe as possible for both of you.

Can you talk to her and explain that, although you are happy for her, it‚Äôs too painful and for the time being, can she refrain from talking about her pregnancy unless you specifically ask her about it? I‚Äôm not sure if she is showing yet but it might be easiest to maintain the relationship over the phone until you come out of your miscarriage fog.

I actually had to do this with one of my employees who was pregnant after my second loss. She was an oversharer which was inappropriate for the workplace but also very painful for me. Let her know that if there is something serious, you are always there for her... but hearing about how the baby was wriggling around during ultrasound is too painful. 

Second, can the two of you plan some way to honor/memorialize your loss? You could have something special that your baby ‚Äúgives‚Äù to her baby after it‚Äôs born. (Angel wings for the nursery, a special stuffed animal, etc) You could get together to release a balloon or light a candle in your baby‚Äôs honor on its due date. I don‚Äôt know if those ideas sound cheesy but it might be helpful to make her a part of your grief rather than separate from it. 

Finally, be extra kind to your self. There are no set rules for how long it takes to get ‚Äúover‚Äù this if that is even possible. My losses fundamentally changed who I am as a person. And that is okay. Just treat yourself well and do whatever YOU need.

People are sensitive to criticism, quick to get defensive, rarely if ever apologize.  

Which is why it took me weeks to tell my sister that something she'd done shortly after our loss was really hurtful.  And why ultimately, I've found it easier more recently to just disengage.  

In my family, it works best to not have these conversations when we're upset, because no matter how diplomatic you try to word your message, the fact that you're upset makes it come across as criticism, triggering the defensiveness.  In our family, it helped to wait until I was calmer, and lead with, ""I know you have good intentions, and didn't mean to do anything that would upset us, but this thing happened, and I wanted to let you know, because I know you wouldn't want to do anything that makes dealing with our loss harder for us.""  

Sometimes it also helps to skip talking about past behavior, and just frame it as, ""We know you want to be supportive, and so what you can do for us right now is X, Y, and Z.""  Sometimes when it sounds more like ""asking for their help"" than ""offering feedback on their past behavior"", sensitive people are less likely to get defensive.  

And sometimes it helps to have the advice on offering support to not ""come from you"".  Like a pamphlet or a website what says, ""Here's how to support your family member/friend after a loss.""  Then it's more like, ""This isn't just me, and this isn't an unreasonable set of requests I'm making.  This is general advice for women in my situation, coming from experts.""

Unfortunately, the resources I was given for family members weren't super helpful.  There's a lot out there on how women feel having to deal with friends and family member who are pregnant, but I haven't seen anything written that's directed to those pregnant friends and family members.  Maybe posting to the main board will bring some suggestions?

Of course, it sucks, when you're grieving more than anyone and trying to take care of yourself, to also have to tiptoe around relatives and be asked to support them and their feelings.  And if someone just disregards anything they ""don't want to hear,"" that's something out of your control.  The option, like you said, of backing off of family dinners, etc. for a while, is always there.

He ended up spending almost an hour talking to me. The conversation only ended when I assured him that I had run out of questions. I can't say enough wonderful things about his expertise, empathy, and generosity. At the end of our conversation, he offered to personally do the operation and start further testing. Somehow through our conversation, I must have said something to endear myself and make him willing to take a new patient.

Definitely get a full RPL workup done if you can. While it may not turn up anything, sometimes you find something simple to treat that can prevent this. 

I had blood testing and karyotype done following 2 losses last year after heartbeat (I also had trouble conceiving and needed assistance). It basically only revealed protein S deficiency, which is a congenital thrombophilia not solidly known to be associated with early miscarriage, but it's just not well studied. Treatment for these is simply a daily anticoagulant injection as soon as you conceive again. Something like 1/20 people have a blood clotting disorder and it usually only manifests during pregnancy when you go into a more ""coagulable state"". Many others have thyroid problems that are also easily treated. I also have subclinical hypo but they won't treat for it here.

It's probably worth trying even if they don't find any blood clotting disorder, because they are only testing for certain more common ones and a couple common mutations known to be present at high frequencies (with genetics, there are infinite others that can be one-off or not well known things - for example with protein S there are so many different mutations that people have, that they only test for protein S levels instead of screening for particular mutations).

I am so sorry you're going through this.  The 2/14 doesn't escape me.  The universe can be really shitty sometimes.  The first two weeks, I didn't try to do too much.  I read things about bereavement and TFMR loss, my husband and I put together a scrapbook photo album for our baby, and other than that, I just tried to make sure I slept properly, ate properly, and got out for a walk.  

I'm really sorry you have to be back at work so soon after.  And especially in that kind of environment.  if you have to, you have to--I don't have any advice to offer there.  

Where we are, strollers and babies are everywhere--going to a cafe, walking to dinner, getting groceries at the farmer's market. It's great for scouting what baby gear is popular when you're expecting.  But after a loss, not great.  I can't avoid them, so I just try to tell myself to be glad that babies are born healthy, because they are evidence that there's hope for me.  

I also tell myself that I don't know what those couples went through to get their babies--maybe infertility (I know a lot in that camp), maybe miscarriages, maybe pPROM, maybe something like us.....for me, that helps too, to remember that at least some of the people I'm seeing are actually in this camp, too. Just farther down the road.

We technically waited until after my second period before starting TTC.  Honestly, for us, when the bad news about the baby, started coming in, getting intimate was the last thing on our minds.  And then there was the loss, the postpartum limitations, the grieving...  As much as I was anxious to start again, for us, it ended up being good to have that first cycle just to get used to being intimate again, without any baby/TTC pressure.  It was good for us to have a little time to reestablish that part of our relationship, just for the two of us, before moving on to TTC.  

It's also taken time for my cycle to go back to what it was when we conceived the last time.  Everything's been a little wonky.  I'm glad we started trying when we did...but I also think our chances are better now that my body's had more time to sort itself out.

27 weeks is hard, because the more time you've lived with your little one, the harder it is to let them go.  But I'm glad that you guys had the opportunity to seek the tests and medical advice you needed to come to your decision in those extra weeks. I hate to think about making this kind of decision when there's still uncertainty--more tests that could be done, or waiting to see how things progress--because there's a deadline to make a decision.  It sounds like you guys took the time to do at much as you could for your little one--getting all the information you could to determine what was best for him.    

Right now, I still have some what-ifs.  Especially as my EDD draws near, I think, ""What if X & Y didn't go wrong, and he survived to term?  What would it he be like?""  I really wish I could meet him like that.  But when I think of what we would have had to put him through for that to happen, for him to survive more than 2-3 days....Like you, I never find myself thinking that we should have chosen another course.  

It helps to hear how things have gone for women who are farther down the road.  Thanks for sharing your experience, and your offer to PM.  :-)

Weeks of testing and talking to doctors and waiting, and then all of a sudden, you're asked to make all these consequential decisions with virtually no time to ask questions or process or get on the same page as your husband.  I certainly felt rushed when I was going through it.

I'm not an expert, but I would say that there are some types of testing that likely need to be decided on now--things like immunological blood work, and whether or not to have an autopsy performed.  

But the decision to have further DNA testing done on the baby....if that's on the table, then in theory, that can be done in stages.  In theory, they can take a sample from the baby for DNA testing, put it in a freezer, and just keep it there until you've had a bit of time to make a decision.  Once the sample is frozen, it will keep for a long time--months if not years.

Essentially, you'd say, ""We'd like you to to take a sample for this DNA test, but instead of sending it for testing immediately, we would like it frozen/stored temporarily, so that we can make a decision when we've had a bit of time.""

Because hospitals don't like samples or tests getting lost, and sitting in a freezer without a clear plan of action certainly increases the risk of that happening, asking for something like this might be outside their normal protocols.  But this is a procedural hurdle.  From a technical standpoint, there's generally no reason why samples for DNA can not be temporarily frozen and stored.  

It might be something worth pushing for given the various uncertainties in play.  (You and your husband not being on the same page, the costs involved, the desire to not make a decision about the future when you need to focus on what's happening right now, etc.)  You might learn something from the birth, other bloodwork, or an autopsy that makes you lean more one way or the other.  You and your husband might come to a decision you both feel better about.  You might just appreciate not having to rush a decision.

As long as something is in the freezer, you've essentially pressed ""pause"" on the decision making and can do it on your own timeline.  You can always decide to not pursue testing.  But if a sample isn't taken, then there's not much you can do.

(There might be a charge for taking the sample and putting it into storage, but at least you're not committing to the full costs of genetic testing without having much time to sort things out.)

I was told to wait six months before TTC and initially wanted to try ASAP, but in that time, ended up getting a new job and moving to a totally new city. So, over a year later, I‚Äôm still waiting. I wanted to give myself a chance to settle into my new job and home before adding the stress of pregnancy again.

Depending on who the nurse, midwife, doctor, etc we were talking to was, we either got reassurance or doomsday news.  It was exhausting and I must say that when we turned the final corner of knowing we had to induce, there was a small part of me that felt relief that it was finally over. </p>

<p>My best friend was pregnant at the same time as me and just delivered.  I was so anxious leading up to the birth, and going to see the baby, etc, but it was actually fine.  I am 7 weeks out from my loss. I cried when I saw her and periodically throughout my visit to the hospital (thankfully a different hospital to where I was induced), but they weren&#39;t strictly sad tears.  There was a lot of happiness too. 
I&#39;m sure with your sister the feelings will be even more intense, but you might be surprised at your reaction when you&#39;re actually in the baby&#39;s presence. </p>

<p>Good luck with everything - what a shitty path to tread for all of us.  My thoughts are with you x </p>

In my case, my sister and I were only a week apart in our due dates.  Her second child, my first pregnancy.  My loss was also in the 2nd trimester.  

My husband and I live a flight away from our families.  We'd already booked X-mas tickets home.  I hated the idea of going home and seeing my sister's bump--at basically exactly the same stage I should have been.  But at the same time, I knew I couldn't avoid the reality of their healthy child forever.  

So I set rules of engagement.  We would visit, I would spend time around the pregnant sister.  But only on the condition that there was zero talk about my sister's baby/pregnancy around my husband or I.  If the rest of the family wanted to talk, they could do it at the times when we weren't present. 

It might sound extreme, but no one pushed back about it.  And to be honest, it probably wasn't even enough.  The holiday was still miserable, and I definitely spent time crying by myself or with my husband in a bedroom because of insensitive behavior.  

I've also set some rules about other types of family communication.  What I'm okay hearing about, receiving in the mail, etc., and what I'm not.  Rules mean that I don't have to continually field the question, ""Would you be okay if....?""  

It's okay to ask for an abundance of space/consideration.  If it's more than you need, then you can always adjust.  I'm in the position where my family has said/done enough insensitive things, that I've really stopped communicating with them in recent weeks.  Hopefully if you set some boundaries, you won't find yourself in the same position.

I'm so sorry. Given what's on your plate right now, I understand if thinking about testing is no longer at the top of your mind.  But I wanted to pass on a little information, just in case.  

My son's illness took a rare form which could be diagnosed via a CGH microarray.  But reading the medical literature, I learned that >90% of cases of his syndrome cannot be detected that way.  The amnio microarrays are not sensitive enough to detect tiny changes in the gene responsible.  

I know one couple in a situation similar to yours.  There were congenital defects, but all genetic tests have come back negative.  They had an autopsy performed.  That narrowed the list of possible illnesses, though it was not definitive.  

Through their genetic counselor, they enrolled in a university hospital trial that will do a ""whole exome"" analysis.  Researchers take mom, dad, and baby's DNA, sequence every the gene in each person, and look for a change in baby's DNA that isn't in mom or dad.   

This approach will one day probably become standard, but right now it is still in the research/trial phase.  It's not available everywhere.  And while it can detect tiny changes in the baby's DNA that other tests can't, doctors might not know which changes found are harmful and which are not.  There's a good chance that the screening just returns a list of ""variants of unknown significance"" (VUS).  But the chance at an answer makes it worth it for them, particularly as their loss was their first child, and they would like to try again.

If you and your husband know you will not trying for another baby, it might not make sense for you to try to pursue something like this.  Given amount of effort it might take to have a DNA sample from your son saved, find a study, try to get enrolled, etc. and given the likelihood of just getting VUS, I imagine many families, myself included, would feel their energy was better spent grieving and trying to heal.  But it's worth knowing about.      

As for carrier testing, that's more straight-forward.  I know Counsyl does sequenced-based carrier testing for a fairly long list of conditions.  It's saliva-based (no need for a blood-draw).  In the event that your insurance didn't cover it, it would be $300-$400, I think.  I think that's per couple, not per person.  But I'm not sure.  And other companies offer tests, too.

<p>If you and your husband know you will not trying for another baby, it might not make sense for you to try to pursue something like this.  Given amount of effort it might take to have a DNA sample from your son saved, find a study, try to get enrolled, etc. and given the likelihood of just getting VUS, I imagine many families, myself included, would feel their energy was better spent grieving and trying to heal.  But it&#39;s worth knowing about.      </p>

<p>As for carrier testing, that&#39;s more straight-forward.  I know Counsyl does sequenced-based carrier testing for a fairly long list of conditions.  It&#39;s saliva-based (no need for a blood-draw).  In the event that your insurance didn&#39;t cover it, it would be $300-$400, I think.  I think that&#39;s per couple, not per person.  But I&#39;m not sure.  And other companies offer tests, too.</p>

<p>Really wish everyone could get answers.  Especially for recurrent losses.  Hug.  </p>

I&#39;d say the past week I&#39;ve gone past the point of feeling &quot;generally bad with good days&quot; to &quot;generally good with bad days&quot; and I know I&#39;m not at the end of the line yet and I&#39;m still moving, so I&#39;m hopeful for the future.</p>

<p>Please don&#39;t be too hard on yourself. After just a month it&#39;s very normal you&#39;re not feeling &quot;the overall happiness&quot;, but if you want it to and you believe it will, then it WILL come back. It&#39;s hard work, but it&#39;ll come.</p>

In my experience, this was extremely uncomfortable, but I think my cervix is particularly sensitive so take that with a grain of salt. Once the catheter is in place, they remove the speculum. They push fluid through the catheter and take images. I also found this part crampy and uncomfortable. 

With an HSG, the fluid is a special dye and the imaging is done with a special sort of x-ray (this is different from the saline sonohystogram, which is done with saline and vaginal ultrasound). The fluid pushes the walls of the uterus apart slightly, which allows the doctor to see any unusual structures in the uterus, like scarring, fibroids, etc. It also goes into the tubes and, depending on whether it spills out or not, the doctor can see if the tubes are open, partially closed, or completely closed. The reason you're getting an HSG done is because the dye gives a better view of the tubes. The saline is used when the questions are more about the uterus.

One of the nice things about HSGs is that sometimes they can clear any tube blockages during the procedure, by pushing more dye through. Some women get pregnant the very same cycle and swear that it's this test that made the difference.

One other good thing about the procedure - since a doctor needs to be there to interpret the images in real time, you'll probably get results right away.

You might find lots of useful information over at r/stilltrying  - there are a bunch of great folks over there who are also in the early stages of fertility testing, and you'll find tons of stories about the different types of testing that can be done and what the experience is like, including some detailed accounts of HSGs.

I had an HSG last year, and while it was admittedly a little scary, it wasn't as bad as I thought it might be. The gist of it is that they insert a small catheter into your uterus through your cervix, and then push some dye in. This all happens while you're laying on a table with an imaging system over you (I forget what exactly it is, but it was basically just a camera, not enclosed like an MRI). If your tubes are open, you'll be able to see the dye go through them in the image that shows up on the screen. To be totally honest, the catheter part was uncomfortable and the initial push of the dye did hurt a bit, but the pain lasted a very short time, and I was fine afterwards. However, I was lucky because my tubes weren't blocked - I've heard from others that it can be rather painful if there is a blockage, but in either case the pain does go away when they stop pushing in the dye. You might have some cramping afterward, but I found it was nothing some ibuprofen couldn't handle. Unfortunately I can't answer re: the cost, I was very lucky that insurance covered most of it for me.

I hope that helps a little, and that your doctor can get you some answers! <3",[],,t1_duvsdbl,False,0,[],False,"<div class=""md""><p>I&#39;m so very sorry for your loss and for your continued struggles. &lt;3</p>

It was small but still made us feel like we acknowledged her which helped both of us. Maybe something simple like that would be good for you guys?</p>

I‚Äôm so upset and angry that this happened twice after having two healthy children. I really want answers so hopefully my husband will be on board with further testing. This does feel a little different this time around than last. Last time we were completely blind sided at my anatomy scan. At least this time we had a heads up. After a month of hell, I do feel some relieved that I will no longer be in limbo. I just really wanted that baby so bad. I look at my boys playing Legos right now and I think about my boys in Heaven. What would they look like? Would they like Legos too? </p>

I don't think most people realise just how terrible looking at your dead baby is, especially when those early signs of decomposition have already set in. I've seen a couple of dead (adult) family members in my life and you could probably just say they looked like they were sleeping. A dead baby does not look like they're sleeping at all. They look so very dead and it's heartbreaking. 

I decided to stay off the bumper sub for a little while. I want to get excited and plan, but then something like that brings me right back to my grief and absolute fear of this happening again.

My bumper group just triggered me pretty hard talking about how ugly new born babies are and how annoying their screams are. I know they don't mean it, but of course I'm not logical about this sort of thing. Prior to my loss I probably would've agreed with them. 

My baby boy was the ugliest child I've ever seen in my life. Because he was dead and had huge patches of skin missing - including on his face. His nose and eyes were leaking and his skull hadn't handled birth well so the midwives had to put hats on him to keep it together. He looked like a grumpy old man with a gaping mouth. I only held him twice, which I deeply regret, because his rate of decomposition broke my heart. He was so fragile.

I know these women will love their babies and they don't mean to cause any upset, but I just think...any living, healthy baby is a beautiful thing.

I'm about 4.5 months out from losing my son at 20 weeks in October. All looked fine at 16 weeks, then at the 20 week appointment, no heartbeat. He measured around 17 weeks, which explains why I didn't feel him moving those last few weeks. We did have a chance to do testing but there was no material information as to what happened. I guess that is often the case.

My due date was this past Tuesday and it was really sad but after anxiously anticipating that milestone, I'm somewhat relieved to be past it. We're now NTNP, and while a part of me wanted to get pregnant asap, I'm kind of glad we haven't yet. Sidenote, my cycles have been insane (first cycle was about 99 days, and now I'm on day 37 of my second cycle) so be ready for that.

I&#39;m about 4.5 months out from losing my son at 20 weeks in October. All looked fine at 16 weeks, then at the 20 week appointment, no heartbeat. He measured around 17 weeks, which explains why I didn&#39;t feel him moving those last few weeks. We did have a chance to do testing but there was no material information as to what happened. I guess that is often the case.</p>

<p>My due date was this past Tuesday and it was really sad but after anxiously anticipating that milestone, I&#39;m somewhat relieved to be past it. We&#39;re now NTNP, and while a part of me wanted to get pregnant asap, I&#39;m kind of glad we haven&#39;t yet. Sidenote, my cycles have been insane (first cycle was about 99 days, and now I&#39;m on day 37 of my second cycle) so be ready for that.</p>

From my experience and the research I've done, typically your first blood draw is on day 4 after the injection (considering injection day as day 0). Then you will have another on day 7. Now, the way it was explained to me is that the day 4 blood draw numbers don't matter that much (in fact, it's actually kinda normal to still see a rise in hcg). What they are looking for is at least a 15% drop between day 4 and day 7. Which would mean you wouldn't need another shot. From there, they'll just track your hcg down to zero - maybe like once a week or so. I would call you doctors office and ask what the plan is to track your hcg. 

Also, make sure to stop taking prenatals until you reach zero. The folate/folic acid in them will reduce the effect of the mtx. Most doctors won't recommend this next bit because it's really difficult to follow, but you can also limit folate/folic acid in your diet to help the mtx ""do its job"" so to speak. So no leafy green veggies,  whole grains, and citrus for the first week. It's not necessary to do this, but I think it helped my levels drop significantly - I dropped 93% in the first week (I was about 6 weeks along). This diet sucks balls though.

I am home now and making myself sick with worry about a rupture. I‚Äôve been reading about the higher failure rate of methotrexate with HCG levels over 5,000. Mine were at a high of 10,000 and had dropped to 8,500 by the time I got the shot. 

This is our second loss in six months. I had an early miscarriage/CP in September (I wasn‚Äôt tracking that month and my cycles can be wonky.) It took us 11 months to conceive the first time. 

I feel gutted. I am so scared of a rupture that I don‚Äôt even feel like I can grieve the loss of this very wanted pregnancy. I had been so anxious since I got the positive test that I never enjoyed it for a second. I don‚Äôt know if it was truly a gut feeling something was wrong or if I was just reacting to my fears from my first loss. I‚Äôm terrified of the idea of even trying again. Terrified of losing some of my already challenged fertility. Terrified of this happening again. I am exhausted and in pain and overwhelmed at the idea of facing weeks of blood draws and waiting for my HCG to go down, with the chance I‚Äôll need emergency surgery at any time until it reaches zero. 

Sorry this was a really long comment. And I don‚Äôt even know if it belongs here or if I should have made a stand-alone post. I am just grateful this community exists, although it‚Äôs a shitty club to be in and I‚Äôm sorry anyone has to experience this kind of grief.

For one, ovulation is approaching. I know SO and I decided to go a more NTNP approach instead of hitting every day to every other day of fertile window (more or less for my sanity because then I start to symptom spot and go nuts during the TWW, just to feel disappointed when flo starts), but I would still like to have sex on at least one of the days close to O, to at least feel like ""ok we did *something* this month"". Maybe that defeats the point of NTNP, but we haven't had sex yet and I'm just annoyed and moody about it. (To be fair SO had the runs and wasn't feeling well last night, so it wouldn't have been fair to him to do it. He said tonight but knowing me, I'll be exhausted by tonight and not want to) 

Work is annoying me. I really don't feel like workin 845-530 today...but they've kind of been assholes lately. Tuesday I was late to work because my boyfriend had a sugar low (type 1 diabetic) right as I woke up for work and I had to help him out of it and make sure he was ok before I could even start to get ready for work and leave...which made me late, which in return caused my manager to be a B to me all day and basically ignore me (no hello, no nothing) 

Number 3 that's annoying me - I have an interview tomorrow. Yay!! It's at a hotel. I've worked hotels before. I am familiar with them. Even though every hotel may have different operating systems and may do things a little bit different with their procedures, they're pretty much all the same in regards to what they do (checking IDs, credit card holds, etc) 
I told SO about it and he's not really supportive of it. At. All. He would prefer I stay at the bank. Where the pay is good. And the drive is only 20 minutes from home as opposed to 40, and the hours are your type 9-5 bankers hours except Thursdays and Fridays. And he's afraid that another hotel will set off my anxiety and I'll have a brreak down like I did 2 years ago (long story but I have since seen a counsellor about those issues) and he says it's just ""two steps backward""

What he fails to realize is I'm not happy at the bank. I'm not loving it. I never want to go in to work. The bank has brought out extreme anxiety in me already. I don't care about how much it pays. They're only giving me about 15-20 hours a week so far... even at an amazing pay rate, I could make more working 40 hrs a week at a hotel getting paid less... but it's also JUST AN INTERVIEW. Doesn't mean I'll get it. Doesn't mean I'll take it. But all in all I just want his support, and I'm annoyed that I don't have it.

My anxiety is getting the best of me and it is starting to seep into my dreams.  They cause me to wake up in a panic.  

I am hoping and praying this baby decides to come out soon.  He is head down and I've got some strong braxton hicks that don't progress.  All of them are in my back, and ultrasound showed that baby is facing out instead of in and unless he turns, I'll be having back labor.  Which, sucks but is it any worse than normal labor?  Also, I just want him out sooo whatever!

<p>I am hoping and praying this baby decides to come out soon.  He is head down and I&#39;ve got some strong braxton hicks that don&#39;t progress.  All of them are in my back, and ultrasound showed that baby is facing out instead of in and unless he turns, I&#39;ll be having back labor.  Which, sucks but is it any worse than normal labor?  Also, I just want him out sooo whatever!</p>

When I arrived at my RE with several early losses under my belt (4 in ~1 year, so similar situation - easy to get pregnant, not-so-easy to stay that way), she advised that we skip IUI and save our money for IVF so we could do PGS testing on any embryos we get. Long story short, she said IUI might slightly increase the chance that we'd get pregnant again on any given cycle (since it's basically depositing the sperm ""right at the front door"" so-to-speak), but it wouldn't do anything to solve the underlying problem with the resulting embryos.

I'm lucky to have insurance that covers some infertility costs, but they required six ""medicated cycles"" before they'd cover IVF. In my case, just taking Femera/letrozole + timed intercourse counted as a ""medicated cycle,"" and that was MUCH cheaper to do (even without insurance coverage, it was ~$60/cycle, compared to a thousand or more for IUI).

So I'd definitely check with your RE to understand why he's suggesting IUI. He might have a good reason, or it might be insurance-related, or it might just be that ""that's what we try first"" and maybe if you advocate for yourself he'll come up with a plan that's better-tailored to your particular history.

I have so much real news to share today. I had yet another BFN this month (which I posted in the results thread using the wrong username) and had healthy results from my 21-day progesterone test. I don't know why I am having so much trouble conceiving after my MC if I am ovulating healthily. Anyway, that feels mundane. It's story time.

For context, one of my best friends started TTC in December. She's not tracking, but she has been meeting for months with the top doctors at her local highly-rated academic medical center to make sure that everything is perfect. Once she started, she and her husband had sex *daily* to make sure that she got pregnant exactly when they planned.

Fast forward three cycles, and she still isn't pregnant. She's basically freaking out. We're close and share everything, so she is sharing every fear with me. I just got another BFN after a year of trying - including a MC and a CP - and am feeling broken and devastated. I understand the stress of not getting pregnant in your expected timeline, but it's hard for me to listen to her panic because she did not get pregnant her first month trying. Beyond that, I really just am not able to deal with her making comments about being okay with adoption. She's been trying for THREE MONTHS. Without temping or taking OPKs. I understand that any loss of control can be stressful, but I feel like I am sitting in a hospital with a gangrenous leg while the person in the bed next to me with a paper cut talks about getting their fears about getting their own leg amputated. It's a freaking paper cut - count your blessings. I'm happy to kiss her boo boo and give her a bandaid, but I think it's fair for me to have limited bandwidth to deal with her fatalism when I am trying so freaking hard to stay hopeful in a more bleak situation. *[Edit: I don't even think my situation actually is bleak - I think I still was a stuck in a rabbit hole of negativity from yesterday's conversation with her when I wrote this.]*

Anyway, I told her as much. I told her as much really, really gently in much kinder language than I am using in this post. She responded by basically shutting me down using sassy language that I hadn't seen her use in over a decade. She reacted as if I had rudely told her that her problems didn't matter and I didn't want to talk to her ever again.

Trust me, I get that she's stressed. I also get that this whole process is relative. One of the things that I love about this community is that we're supportive and validating of a wide range of experiences. I don't mean to compete with her, but I also ask for empathy during my own challenges. When she expresses her worst-case fears after only 3 months, what the heck does that imply about my situation? When she tells me that she wants to give up, what does that say about my unwillingness to do so? 

I just... I just can't. I want to settle down, have children, and become a mother, not have this whole mess of TTC revert my own friendships into an immature state.

Should I supplement with progesterone before I can even know I am pregnant just to be on the safe side? Do I wait? I know that with PCOS low progesterone can be a cause of loss. I feel like I need to take it because it can't hurt and I want the best chance possible if I am pregnant.  Am I just making myself crazy?

<p>Which brings me to my next question. I am 4 DPO (my ovulation moved to day 14 after the loss).
