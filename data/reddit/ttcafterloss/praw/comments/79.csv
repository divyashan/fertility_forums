We had rpl testing done which included skipping a cycle so we could get all the testing done and results back. At some point in there, I was ready to try again. I still want(ed) a baby and the desire for that is stronger than the fear of another loss. 

Who knows how you and your partner will feel over time as you deal with this loss. But it's possible to experience those feelings and be ready to ttc again relatively soon. It's also possible to need more time.

<p>Who knows how you and your partner will feel over time as you deal with this loss. But it&#39;s possible to experience those feelings and be ready to ttc again relatively soon. It&#39;s also possible to need more time. </p>

Sometimes I think I am irrational too but I think what it really comes down to is that you know your partner best.

Mine's reaction to the first loss was that he hated seeing me like that and thought it would be too hard on me to try again. I did try to get to the root of that concern, because at the end of the day that should be for me to decide but I was concerned that he was saying one thing but meaning another (like, maybe it was *him* that it would be too hard on). We didn't move forward with trying again until he was able to determine that he could handle it, but he had such a hard time coming to that conclusion that I have been nervous to share with him either until I feel we are ""safe"" (whatever that means).

I actually had not shared with him yet. Thankfully it's not another MMC like the first time, and my body is doing what it needed to. And I honestly don't know how I feel about it in regards to him not knowing. On one hand I'm incredibly relieved that I don't have to worry about the same ""are we trying again or not?"" roller coaster. On the other hand I feel pretty alone right now, which sucks. 

I'm kind of realizing that I didn't tell him more for me than for him, and it's true. I want another baby so badly it's all I can think about and the fact that he thinks he could be at peace with just our one scares me. Honestly a huge part of it is that I was so invested in our first loss that I can't imagine my life with just one anymore. She needs the sister she lost as much as I need our family to be complete. And I can't even fathom finding a way to unload all of the baby things I (stupidly) purchased too soon. I've dealt with all this ""stuff"" by knowing we're trying again, and had even started organizing some of it when I got my most recent BFP.

I guess I'm just trying to say that I don't think you're horrible for trying to protect yourself.

I don‚Äôt know if it‚Äôs a weird power move or if she really doesn‚Äôt know how it affects me but it really ruins my whole day when she brings it up. </p>

<p>I hope your husband feels safe enough to tell his boss that the way he compares his family life to his own is triggering and unnecessary. But I know that is easier said than done. I still haven‚Äôt found a way to fix it for myself except to find a new job. </p>

<p>Good luck from the bottom of my heart ‚ù§Ô∏è</p>

I had two d&c‚Äôs last year for a miscarriage at 9 weeks. It was an iud pregnancy. The first procedure was in the OR and main purpose was to remove my iud with hysteroscopy guidance. For the next 6 weeks I continued to bleed though I was assured things were probably returning to normal, however they weren‚Äôt. I lost a ton of blood and had to have another d&c in the OR with ultrasound guidance. I was told by both doctors they were done very carefully, but I still worried sooooo much about getting pregnant after.

I didn‚Äôt mention this but I also had an infection from the iud while miscarrying but this was treated in emergency care immediately and they tried to remove the iud with instrumentation while I was conscious (absolute hell, very traumatizing). 

HOWEVER - I am currently 21 weeks pregnant and did conceive on the first cycle of trying. 

Please please don‚Äôt worry about your d&c‚Äôs. They are FAR less risky than they were in the past and not done aggressively the way they used to be. My OBGYNs were more concerned about the infection rather than the d&c‚Äôs.  Scar tissue is possible but it‚Äôs mainly adhesions that would cause complications for conception and pregnancy.

The lack of helpfulness from your RE office must be really frustrating and hard on top of an already awful situation. 

As for next steps I think there are a ton of different option so there isnt a right or a wrong here. 

Medically speaking I'm just going to tell you what my RE did. They waited till after the bleeding stopped by like... two weeks or so to even start with blood testing. They actually did an ultrasound too just to confirm everything was clear. Unfortunately infection/retained tissue is a very real issue so the peace of mind that at least it was ""over"" was nice. We were told to wait until after I got my first natural period... until trying again. (Some people dont though and it doesnt seem to be a huge issue outside of making dating hard... which, in my case, would've made it hard to establish a impending miscarriage since we only found out because I was a full week behind.) Her main reasoning was because she likes to give the body time to heal and lessen the chance of another loss. She said one cycle was more than enough though. 

As for your progesterone worries... totally valid! I would ask for, at the very least, progesterone suppositories. They're not pleasant but it does help with progesterone difficiency. I basically start them 2 days after my IUIs... or 2-3 days after O day and continue up till af is expected. 

For the record... I've read a ton on whether progesterone supplements really help. Maybe it is just a psychological thing for me but I didnt get pregnant until I was on it... like not a single time and I got pregnant my first cycle with it...but my doctor didnt keep me on it when I was pregnant and I feel really strongly about staying on it in the event that I ever get pregnant again. 

At the end of the day... if you Express your concerns and your RE doesnt listen to you I would honestly find another one. It doesnt hurt anything to be on  progesterone so I'd be surprised if they didnt let you at least try it....

I had my miscarriage in march. Should have been 12 weeks but measured 8weeks. I did two rounds of misprostol too. And I also haven't gotten pregnant.

Since my miscarriage, my cycles have been very irregular. They used to be consistently 33 days but since then they have been 45 days. I went to a midwife to talk to her about it since I read everything should be back to normal after 3 months.

Her advice to me? Stop trying for a few months. I admit, I go kinda crazy when trying. I was temping, I was doing OPKs, I was using multiple apps, I was on all facebook groups and forums etc. She thinks I stressed myself out too much. I've also read that after the medicine, it may take longer for everything to go back to normal. I've decided I am not getting pregnant this year. I've put it in my head that its not happening and I'm trying to accept that. It's honestly made me feel a little more relaxed already.

Reading so many stories can be difficult, but I have to remind myself that not everyone will seek out support online, and those that do may have worse situations due to selection bias.

Ideally you want someone that uses micro scissors to cut the scarring out & does this kind of procedure relatively frequently. From the research that I've done though, there's not a consensus on exactly what the best way to properly remove the scarring is. Some kind of balloon stent seems to be standard, hormones 50/50, both are in the ""can't hurt, might help"" camp. Again though, I think a lot of the FB group population is women who had issues with initial surgeries and ended up in the group looking for help, whereas women with 1 and done surgeries with local docs don't seek out support. 


From what I've seen, if pregnancy is desired, most docs recommended getting pregnant ASAP in an attempt to beat regrowth of scar tissue (if it unfortunately comes back).

<p>I hope none of that comes off as harsh; I really just want to say it&#39;s okay to grieve dreams and it can also be helpful to think about what it is you&#39;re grieving. For me that&#39;s often been an important part of the healing process through any sad time in my life, as a way to get a little clarity and more self-understanding.</p>

You can be upset even if you expect(ed) yourself to be able to brush it off more easily.


Two years ago I was working as a lawyer and I was near my breaking point in terms of caseload. One of my coworkers suggested I go to therapy. Therapy is cool and normal and yet I told him, ""I don't want to feel like I have to go to therapy just to do my job. That's fucked."" And I kept working and I lost weight from skipping lunch 3 days a week due to my work requirements (even though I was eating whatever I wanted at night which usually included beef burritos and jalepeno kettle potato chips) and it wasn't uncommon to spend a day in bed on the weekends because I was just emotionally and physically drained. And I took a few days off of work around my birthday when my family came to visit and I was still getting texts from work and I learned one of my clients had gotten out of jail because as my family and I were walking around for lunch, I heard him yelling on his phone down the street.


And I was mad at myself that I couldn't make myself just shape up and be less upset about the unfairness of the world. I'm rational. People get upset. I know the world is unfair.


When I came back to work after just a few days off I felt more behind than ever. I was determined to power through. While I had a good day, it left me exhausted and I had barely put a dent in everything I needed to do. I had had a trip planned for a few months later after a work commitment and since I didn't meet the work commitment, I was crushed. 


I ended up taking the trip anyway because I'd paid for the concert and the hotel and my partner was flying out to meet me. And I was so excited for the concert. And I wept half the time. Partly for myself. And then because I was feeling sorry for myself when my life is great in the grand scheme of things. My clients were dealing with severe mental illness, hunger, homelessness, job loss, and more on top of facing criminal charges. And here I was on a vacation most of them could never afford and crying feeling badly for myself. And something in me snapped into focus: I didn't have to work that job. The people who love me would still love me even if I couldn't do a job that emotionally devastated me. 


That next Monday sucked. And I decided I'd work one more month before closing the chapter on that experience. My coworker who had told me to go to therapy, when I told him I was leaving, he told me that he understood. And that my words about having to go to therapy due to work made him realize the environment was more fucked than he was realizing, he was just more entrenched in it. I was sad to go but I knew there was strength in saying I wasn't going to be subjected to it anymore. And guess what? After I left, they hired two people in my place. I still haven't gotten another legal job because I feel some pain still about the job and the lack of work life balance in the law is insane and I refuse to subject myself to pain for money. Life is too fucking short for that shit.


But today, before I called to cancel what was supposed to be my pregnancy confirmation appointment due to a chemical I had only confirmed the day before my heavy bleeding started, I reminded myself that I'm strong even when I feel weak. I am emotionally intelligent enough to know that it takes a lot of emotional strength to say I'm not okay, and that is okay. You are not alone. You are stronger than you feel right now. You deserve more kindness than you're giving yourself right now. You might not even give a fuck about what I'm saying because I'm some internet stranger who wrote a motherfucking essay just to try to let you know you're fucking normal for feeling the way you feel. And that is cool too. I'll be thinking about you and hoping you're letting yourself feel things and breathe and thay sooner rather than later you'll be better.",[],,t1_eugnme4,False,0,[],False,"<div class=""md""><p>You can complain about your job even if you chose it. You can be upset even if you expect(ed) yourself to be able to brush it off more easily.</p>

<p>Two years ago I was working as a lawyer and I was near my breaking point in terms of caseload. One of my coworkers suggested I go to therapy. Therapy is cool and normal and yet I told him, &quot;I don&#39;t want to feel like I have to go to therapy just to do my job. That&#39;s fucked.&quot; And I kept working and I lost weight from skipping lunch 3 days a week due to my work requirements (even though I was eating whatever I wanted at night which usually included beef burritos and jalepeno kettle potato chips) and it wasn&#39;t uncommon to spend a day in bed on the weekends because I was just emotionally and physically drained. And I took a few days off of work around my birthday when my family came to visit and I was still getting texts from work and I learned one of my clients had gotten out of jail because as my family and I were walking around for lunch, I heard him yelling on his phone down the street.</p>

<p>And I was mad at myself that I couldn&#39;t make myself just shape up and be less upset about the unfairness of the world. I&#39;m rational. People get upset. I know the world is unfair.</p>

<p>When I came back to work after just a few days off I felt more behind than ever. I was determined to power through. While I had a good day, it left me exhausted and I had barely put a dent in everything I needed to do. I had had a trip planned for a few months later after a work commitment and since I didn&#39;t meet the work commitment, I was crushed. </p>

<p>I ended up taking the trip anyway because I&#39;d paid for the concert and the hotel and my partner was flying out to meet me. And I was so excited for the concert. And I wept half the time. Partly for myself. And then because I was feeling sorry for myself when my life is great in the grand scheme of things. My clients were dealing with severe mental illness, hunger, homelessness, job loss, and more on top of facing criminal charges. And here I was on a vacation most of them could never afford and crying feeling badly for myself. And something in me snapped into focus: I didn&#39;t have to work that job. The people who love me would still love me even if I couldn&#39;t do a job that emotionally devastated me. </p>

<p>That next Monday sucked. And I decided I&#39;d work one more month before closing the chapter on that experience. My coworker who had told me to go to therapy, when I told him I was leaving, he told me that he understood. And that my words about having to go to therapy due to work made him realize the environment was more fucked than he was realizing, he was just more entrenched in it. I was sad to go but I knew there was strength in saying I wasn&#39;t going to be subjected to it anymore. And guess what? After I left, they hired two people in my place. I still haven&#39;t gotten another legal job because I feel some pain still about the job and the lack of work life balance in the law is insane and I refuse to subject myself to pain for money. Life is too fucking short for that shit.</p>

I know what you feel like right now or at least I can guess: it seems like a long time and you wish it was sooner. I have done a ton of research and 6 months is the earliest that gets recommended. Much more often it is a year or more that doctors suggest, in very few instances is it less than 6 months. But that number is so low! (It may be what you want to hear but is that really good?)
Here are my reasons why I think 6 months is a good time:
You are giving your uterus time to heal. And that is sooo neccessary!! 
You are giving yourself time to grieve and that is also so neccessary. You may think another pregnancy will help (and it does to some extend but not without having had the time to mourn and go through a part of the process.) Also pregnancy after loss is TOUGH emotionally. You might constantly wonder if your baby is still alive, you will question everything you do and you will doubt and doubt more. Your body needs to be in a place to be able to deal with that.
Try to do the best you can right now even if it‚Äôs tough: eat well, heal physically and make process emotionally (and I‚Äôm purposefully not saying heal because I believe there is no real healing from the loss of a child.)

Why I think waiting a year or more is not necessary: you are not going to go through contractions/ labor birth. It‚Äôs not like a c-section scar that needs to be strong enough for a vbac.

Last recommendation: consider getting an mri sometime after 3 or 4 months or anytime after that. It can give some information on the scar, I know somebody who had to have their scar fixed in order to get the ok to get pregnant again, she would have risked uterine rupture if she had just gone ahead with another pregnancy. More likely you will get a result that gives you more confidence in your scar.

My period was a week late, this is the first time I have been more then a day late since starting my medication (8 months) so we really thought we were pregnant again, I let myself get more excited as more days past even though I got constant BFNs, I didn‚Äôt get a positive with my first pregnancy until 6 weeks, but all that hope has turned to pain as my period arrived 4 days ago.

I also have hypothyroidism and my endocrinologist wanted to get my tsh levels below 2 before I even started trying.

So that timeline is 1 month for the retrieval cycle, then all the embryos from that cycle are biopsied for PGS and frozen down. It takes 2 weeks for the PGS test results to come back, so you skip the cycle after the retrieval, then you can do a transfer on the following cycle.

My biggest recommendation is to get follow up imaging. I went to the best surgeon in the area (people fly in from other parts of the country / world) to be operated on by him, and we never did any follow up imaging. He said my uterus was as if the septum was never there and I was good to go. I trusted him (I had no reason not to), so I went on my happy way.

Two miscarriages later, further testing revealed that some of the septum remained and I underwent a second procedure to remove that, some retained placental tissue, and some polyps. One more loss and I went to a cutting edge surgeon in a different state and had the final bits of septum removed. (Really cool procedure using something called micro-scissors - done within 5 minutes with no anesthesia - just motrin and a heat pack).

So. Anytime I come across someone with a septum, I tell them the same thing. Get follow up imaging. I think the option that showed my uterus most clearly was a 3D saline sonogram. I don't want to scare you or other readers. I just don't want anyone to go through what I did.

The positive news is that my fourth pregnancy resulted in my happy, beautiful 10 month old daughter. Hope this helps. Feel free to reach out at any time with questions or concerns.

If you look it up, most cheapies start detecting at around 20-25 mIU... FRERs say they can detect as low as 6.5 mIU. That's a huge difference unfortunately when it comes to waiting for hcg to drop after a mc bc it seems to drop so stinking slowly. 

Accedotally, I used a cheapie the first time I got a bfp and it was pretty light. The line I got with the frer about 20 mins later was much stronger. The next say my blood test came back at 70 so it makes sense that the cheap ones were light. 

After my miscarriage, I decided on a random day just under a month after I took miso to take a cheapie just to see. It was stark white. Exactly one week after that I got my next blood test and it came back as 4. I was so shocked because I figured if it had been soooo negative on that hpt, it should surely be negative for the blood test too. But nope. 4. And while that is technically a negative (anything less than 5 is at my RE) it still took 7 more days for me to get my period and that was 10 days after I would've normally expected it. 

So I guess in conclusion, you could definitely have hcg in your system from your mc.

The hpts are inconclusive bc of the different brands and their sensitivities. BUT theoretically you could be pregnant because if you had sex around O day you could have conceived. It happens.

Unfortunately, you just have to wait it out. You could technically test with cheapies since you recently werent offered t the threshold for a positive... if you did wind up with a positive now on one it would be good news.

I was in a similar situation, my levels continued to rise even after growth stopped during my MMC, and my dr scheduled my quickly so I could get it over with. I don't recall the level I peaked at, but our D&C was around the 8 week mark and growth had stopped around 5+5. 

My procedure was quick. I opted to be put totally under for it. The nurses were all very nice and gave me lots of information (I preferred it this way, rather than not knowing what they were doing). When they took me into the back I had to take a pregnancy test (I assume to test levels) before getting onto the bed. They took some readings, asked me about allergies, confirmed my personal info. Then the anesthesiologist came in and put in my IV. Another nurse put wraps on my legs, which is to keep the blood flowing during the procedure. When it was time, my doctor arrived and we spoke for a minute. She told me what to expect and gave my husband info on what I might need for recovery. They wheeled me into another room for the procedure and pretty soon I was under. I woke up not long after with what felt like cramps and pressure. Went to the bathroom and had a lot of bleeding right away - it was just like a really heavy period for 3-4 days. I wore overnight pads (they tell you no tampons and no sex for 2 weeks - it's called ""pelvic rest""). I can't recall if they advised against heavy exercise, unfortunately. My husband drove me home after I waited in recovery for about 30-45 minutes. It wasn't long because I was able to stand up on my own. We got home and I went to bed. They told me I could take a lot of ibuprofen, and I used my heating pad for a while which helped a lot. I was super crampy and didn't leave my bed all day. The next day (my surgery was a Friday which was convenient, and I took the day off work) I stayed in bed or on the couch watching TV. I had HORRIBLE cramps that morning, and nausea, but my doctors weren't concerned, it was likely a combination of bad cramps and the anesthesia. By Sunday I was still crampy but I got up, took a shower, hung out around the house. That Monday I went to an on-site work gig and brought my heating pad, no one noticed (I use it for regular cramps sometimes). I had an event that Wednesday night (so 5 days after surgery) and I drove myself, socialized, wore a nice skirt, was very much back to normal. I still had cramping all week, but it was very manageable with ibuprofen and the heating pad at night. 

I got my period back exactly 4 weeks after my surgery (I also have very regular periods, so this might not be the case for everyone but for me I was back on track). It was a really tough period - bad cramps, super heavy bleeding. I get other symptoms sometimes like vertigo and nausea, and those were both cranked up as well. My doctor assured me this was normal, and sure enough my last few periods since then have tapered off into normalcy. 

I'm so, so sorry you're going through this. Feel free to DM me if you have questions or just want to talk. All I can say is you'll get through this, and it's okay to take a day off and to be sad - it really sucks. But also know this procedure is relatively common, and you'll be okay! <3

Edit: As for waiting to try - my doctor advised that we not try on the cycle immediately following the D&C.

I'm glad to hear you're considering couples counseling! We didn't go as a couple but I went on my own, which is what suited our circumstances, and found it to be tremendously useful.

Everyone is different, but a few things that collectively made a really positive difference in my relationship was not explicitly discussing my fertility window with my partner anymore. It lifted a huge emotional burden off my back and helped us focus communication with each other on emotionally uplifting, positive, enjoyable parts of life. I still track my fertility in pretty basic ways but we have had way more sex during our window now that we don't talk about when I'm ovulating it anymore. We still talk with each other about our thoughts and feelings about our losses and desires to be parents, I just don't say, ""hey I'm ovulating so let's get down to it!"" anymore.

We also started planning surprise dates for each other where we would pick a night and one of us would plan something out, but the other wouldn't know what the plan was until it was happening! Very fun and brought a lot of the romantic, lighthearted vibe back into our relationship.

Getting out of town on weekend getaways has been a HUGE positive boost for our marriage. Nothing fancy, just camping or something like that. But I noticed we rarely traveled if it wasn't for weddings or family functions, which meant whenever we got away we were around people. Getting away just the two of us just for fun has really helped bring us together again, especially at the lowest points.

Edit: I forgot to mention that my partner experienced a lot of anxiety and a sense of failure related to our losses. Talking about those feelings and reassuring him that I don't blame him at all for what we have been through helped our relationship. Also, knowing how he was feeling, I started making an effort to really build him up emotionally and that has also helped with the frequency and quality of sex, including during our fertility window.

MMC in March at 10 weeks after seeing a heartbeat, ended up needing a D&C, and a second one a month after because of retained tissue. I didn't get a real period until 4 weeks after that second D&C (so 8 weeks+ after my first D&C) in May. 2 months later and my cycles are a bit wonky, and no luck yet getting pregnant again - but thankfully the HCG is gone.

In terms of still testing positive on the pregnancy tests - have you been checked for retained tissue?

MMC in March at 10 weeks after seeing a heartbeat, ended up needing a D&amp;C, and a second one a month after because of retained tissue. I didn&#39;t get a real period until 4 weeks after that second D&amp;C (so 8 weeks+ after my first D&amp;C) in May. 2 months later and my cycles are a bit wonky, and no luck yet getting pregnant again - but thankfully the HCG is gone.</p>

<p>In terms of still testing positive on the pregnancy tests - have you been checked for retained tissue?

I bought a tempdrop and use opks. I tried oral and vaginal temping and hated it. HATED it.

Tempdrop isnt for everyone and vaginal temps are probably way more accurate but I get nice, easy to understand charts with clear shifts so I have no complaints. As far as opks go... I've taken them since the second cycle we were ttc. I always get a positive that's easy to read so again... it just works for me and requires minimal effort.

It took a while for me to get the hang of understanding my temping charts and I still really struggle with pinpointing O day so I turn to chartstalkers for help. I generally just trust whatever my Fertility Friend app says... 

Full disclosure... temping is just a thing I do now that I'm with an RE. They dont look at or ask for or even recommend temping... however having that data to discuss at my initial consult helped my RE determine that ovulation wasnt our problem and we skipped some testing and saved some money. And really... temping just confirms O. It doesnt really help you time things better unless you're cycles are fairly consistent and you're able to recognize a pattern after a few months. I think it is interesting and worth doing just to see if youre ovulating regularly. 

I HAVE to take opks now bc my RE office schedules IUIs the day after a clear positive. That's the only way they determine timing. I start taking them around cd10 or cd11 and keep going till I get a positive. Before we did IUI cycles, a positive meant having sex. Like right then. And then hopefully/usually the next day but we rarely got 3 days in row. 

You just have to figure out what you're comfortable with and then what you're realistically willing to do.

Waiting was really hard but, like OP said, it does give you some time to do some TLC and focus on something else... as hard as that can be... and that's because most doctors recommend waiting till hcg levels are back to zero before trying again for a few reasons...  I'm assuming those are the numbers you're talking about. If so, you have to get a blood test. I took a pregnancy test about a week before I went and got my numbers checked (which was around 3 weeks after my miscarriage) and it was a stark white bfn... but a week later at the blood test my hcg was still at 4. That's technically a negative but my period didnt start for almost a week after that around when I assume my levels were back to zero.

From what my RE said, they recommend waiting till the first natural period after a miscarriage so that your body has time to process it all because jumping back in to soon can make things complicated... There are plenty of stories on the internet of people who tried and succeeded in getting pregnant before that first period though that had no problems... so it is possible. I kind of see it like the whole ""dont get pregnant until a year after giving birth"" thing. Its recommended, sure, and probably the smart thing to do but do people get pregnant before that? Yep!

I hope the experiences of those of us here can help get you through this tough time ‚ù§Ô∏è my d&c was in March on a Friday. I was 8+1 but my pregnancy had stopped progressing closer to 5 weeks. I went in early in the morning and had to wait about an hour (this was told to me in advance and it wasn‚Äôt any trouble.) My husband sat with me and watched early morning TV in the lobby. The nurses were lovely. When they brought me back for pre-op, they had me do a urine pregnancy test (the nurse was VERY apologetic that they needed to do it, but I think it‚Äôs for measuring levels etc.) They got me into the bed and set me up. The nurses helped explain EVERYTHING about the process, all their names, what the machines around me were for. It was overwhelming but I was glad to be informed. I asked if my husband could sit with me and they said unfortunately not, which I understood. They gave me wraps on my legs to keep the blood flow going and set me up for my anesthesia. After a few moments one of the nurses snuck my husband in from the back to sit with me! We just talked a little. Right before my husband came in, the anesthesiologist, and the only man in the room, tried to distract me by asking if I had any kids SECONDS after confirming I was there for an MMC and D&C. I told my husband this and we were laughing so hard (we have dark senses of humor haha.) But we talked a little and then my doctor came by. She talked to me and my husband, and then talked to him separately about attention I might need afterwards, etc. They took me in for surgery shortly after and I remember almost nothing else after that. I woke up later and felt heavy cramps. There was a nurse there to give me water and a snack and heavy pads- and my clothes back. I bled heavily right away once I got into the bathroom and had to use heavy pads for a few days. I got super strong ibuprofen which I used which was very helpful, and I used a heating pad as well. I stayed in bed all weekend (I definitely recommend taking at least one day off afterwards if you can.) The only negative was I was nauseous the next day, but I have no idea if that‚Äôs because of the cramps, the surgery, the hormones or what. My doctors weren‚Äôt overly concerned and I got my period back EXACTLY the day my doctor predicted. That first period was rough though (super heavy flow, super cramps, super tired) I thought I had appendicitis! But I‚Äôve had 2 more cycles since and they‚Äôre becoming more normal. 

One thing I‚Äôm really happy about was I told my mom and my mother in law about my MMC & D&C. Turns out they had both had them too!

I hope the experiences of those of us here can help get you through this tough time ‚ù§Ô∏è my d&amp;c was in March on a Friday. I was 8+1 but my pregnancy had stopped progressing closer to 5 weeks. I went in early in the morning and had to wait about an hour (this was told to me in advance and it wasn‚Äôt any trouble.) My husband sat with me and watched early morning TV in the lobby. The nurses were lovely. When they brought me back for pre-op, they had me do a urine pregnancy test (the nurse was VERY apologetic that they needed to do it, but I think it‚Äôs for measuring levels etc.) They got me into the bed and set me up. The nurses helped explain EVERYTHING about the process, all their names, what the machines around me were for. It was overwhelming but I was glad to be informed. I asked if my husband could sit with me and they said unfortunately not, which I understood. They gave me wraps on my legs to keep the blood flow going and set me up for my anesthesia. After a few moments one of the nurses snuck my husband in from the back to sit with me! We just talked a little. Right before my husband came in, the anesthesiologist, and the only man in the room, tried to distract me by asking if I had any kids SECONDS after confirming I was there for an MMC and D&amp;C. I told my husband this and we were laughing so hard (we have dark senses of humor haha.) But we talked a little and then my doctor came by. She talked to me and my husband, and then talked to him separately about attention I might need afterwards, etc. They took me in for surgery shortly after and I remember almost nothing else after that. I woke up later and felt heavy cramps. There was a nurse there to give me water and a snack and heavy pads- and my clothes back. I bled heavily right away once I got into the bathroom and had to use heavy pads for a few days. I got super strong ibuprofen which I used which was very helpful, and I used a heating pad as well. I stayed in bed all weekend (I definitely recommend taking at least one day off afterwards if you can.) The only negative was I was nauseous the next day, but I have no idea if that‚Äôs because of the cramps, the surgery, the hormones or what. My doctors weren‚Äôt overly concerned and I got my period back EXACTLY the day my doctor predicted. That first period was rough though (super heavy flow, super cramps, super tired) I thought I had appendicitis! But I‚Äôve had 2 more cycles since and they‚Äôre becoming more normal. </p>

I ended up going to an acupuncturist who specializes in women's health after my second miscarriage, I don't know if any of the hormone balancing stuff was actually effective but it helped with my anxiety tremendously. 

I had a 9w MMC in June 2017, took about 6 weeks for my hcg to go to negative and then about 4 months for my cycle to become regular and then I got pregnant right after. Had a 10w BO in Jan 2018 (though we knew it was likely heading that way around 7w), I started going to the acupuncturist in March 2018 because my anxiety and panic attacks were crippling and I was recommended to give acupuncture a try. My cousin who did IVF went to her because the RE told her it was helpful in hormone balancing and has been beneficial in conjunction with IVF.

<p>I ended up going to an acupuncturist who specializes in women&#39;s health after my second miscarriage, I don&#39;t know if any of the hormone balancing stuff was actually effective but it helped with my anxiety tremendously. </p>

<p>I had a 9w MMC in June 2017, took about 6 weeks for my hcg to go to negative and then about 4 months for my cycle to become regular and then I got pregnant right after. Had a 10w BO in Jan 2018 (though we knew it was likely heading that way around 7w), I started going to the acupuncturist in March 2018 because my anxiety and panic attacks were crippling and I was recommended to give acupuncture a try. My cousin who did IVF went to her because the RE told her it was helpful in hormone balancing and has been beneficial in conjunction with IVF. </p>

Here's my question to the community. I'm a teacher, so if I agree to more years of my job, I'm locked into a full school year every time. We want to leave because this area is super expensive and not where we want to be, and it's already draining our finances to live here, plus my job's health insurance (my husband doesn't work yet) is over $1200 a month for a family plan, which is absolutely ridiculous and we can't afford that. I'm here for this next school year, and then I'm planning to leave and find something else.

But I'm the sole income for the family, and if I quit, my insurance will stop, and then I can't find a new job OR move far away if I'm super pregnant. So we basically have two more months before we're going to have to stop trying so that next June-Oct is open for us to move, for me to find a new job and start working, etc. and get insurance again.

My husband is an English language learning immigrant who doesn't have a college degree, so his work options are really limited and definitely aren't going to make enough money to cover much of anything. It's all me, and that's fine, except for this part and the timing. I turn 35 next month. Do you stop trying after August and wait to start again until January? Is it possible to use that time to see an RE and maybe run some tests or try and improve egg quality? Would they even send us to an RE if we've been trying over 8 months but we had a MC in there (does the counter reset for that if a MC is involved?).

Obviously the last thing I want to do is stop for that time, and it will ruin me to do it, but I really, really want and need to leave this job and this place. If we go back home to the midwest, I've got connections and job prospects that aren't classroom teaching plus family who will help out.

There are still moments where I think about how far along I <em>should</em> be, and it takes me right back to that feeling of despair. But for the most part I am trying to look forward. I think we almost have to or else we‚Äôd just become consumed by grief. </p>

<p>But as an aside, I just want to caution you that using bipolar as a way to describe your current feelings is actually very damaging to those that actually struggle with the disorder. Bipolar disorder is a serious mental illness‚Äînot an emotion or a way to describe having conflicted feelings. Using it in that way only contributes to the way that society currently views mental illness; to this idea that we can just change our attitude and ‚Äúget over it‚Äù or that it‚Äôs not a real illness to begin with because ‚ÄúI felt bipolar once.‚Äù</p>

<p>I don‚Äôt have bipolar disorder, but I do struggle with mental illness so I feel a certain duty to point this out. </p>

<p>I hope you‚Äôre able to conceive again quickly. I know for me that feels like the only way to truly move on.</p>

I'm also still recovering from a CP, or I guess ectopic? Idk it presented as both, but I digress...

I see from your tag that you have PCOS. In the past I've had doctors suspect PCOS for me but never formally diagnosed. And with dietary and lifestyle changes I got my cycle under control, so I didn't think much about it. But here I am with 3 losses, no living children, and my brother has just been diagnosed as diabetic. So I've been looking into it a bit more. I wish I could tell you, ""I did this and it worked!"" but I'm not there yet. However, I am convinced that this approach is going to help me and I really hope to help others too, because the pain of RPL is just too heartbreaking. 

So here it is. Most of us eat a LOT of carbs. When in truth a relatively small percentage of people are well adapted to high carbohydrate diets. Everything from insulin resistance, metabolic syndrome, all the way to diabetes, is directly attributed to the food we consume. Really, the names do a disservice; you could more accurately call all of those symptoms of carbohydrate intolerance. Carbs are not necessary! Look into keto, or low carb high fat. I know from experience that I feel vastly more stable and comfortable in my own skin when I'm not eating carbs.

So what does this have to do with fertility, right? On the front end, insulin interferes with our ovarian hormone production. The oft stated ""I have insulin resistance because of my PCOS"" gets it backward. The insulin resistance (or rather, carbohydrate intolerance) is almost certainly the root cause of the PCOS! And then, even when we get pregnant... insulin is toxic to early development. https://www.healthline.com/health-news/elevated-insulin-levels-toxic-to-placenta
This is why you'll see success stories of those women treating with metformin. But you'll also see success stories from those who went keto! By cutting down the glucose intake, you cut down the insulin, and resolve the issue at its core.

This got really longwinded, sorry. I can share links to more studies if you're interested. Point is, I really feel for you. My heart breaks for all of us in this community.

For me, I bought a bottle of wine and ordered my favorite takeout on the day we found out. On the D&C day I wasn't hungry and just slept. 

Grief is not linear, you may feel better if you celebrate today or the weekend or next week. You may not feel like yourself for a while and you may feel fine and then not fine and then fine again -- over and over for longer than you feel is ""okay"". 

My husband and I booked a little long weekend trip over the due date of my first miscarriage, to take some time to reconnect / make a positive out of what we were sure was going to be a shitty day. I ended up miscarrying for the second time at 10 wks, 6 days before the first due date so the trip was extra needed because the date felt extra extra crappy. While, bleeding my way through our little reconnect trip was not what I had envisioned, it really did help to make the due date less crappy. 

For the due date, of the second miscarriage, my husband was away for work so I spent the day with some girlfriends - and it actually didn't feel as crappy as I expected.

I will say, I am now 1 year past 1 due date and nearly 1 year past the second, over two years past the first miscarriage, and those days still draw a gut reaction from me. Sad, angry, disappointed - I run the gamut. This year, on the 2yr anniversary of the day we found out the heartbeat was gone - I didn't actually remember until TimeHop reminded me, so I'm counting that as progress! 

I am a big reader and a big podcast listener, these are what helped me process everything and work through my feelings:

Be easy on yourself and each other. There is no correct way to feel and there is no timeline for when you feel ""better"".",[],,t1_etcymsz,False,0,[],False,"<div class=""md""><p>Today, you do with yourself whatever feels right. If that is celebrating your anniversary, celebrate! If it&#39;s crying on the couch into some ice cream, break out the spoons! If it is somewhere or nowhere in between, do that. There is no map that tells you exactly what to do and there is nothing that is okay or not okay to feel. </p>

<p>For me, I bought a bottle of wine and ordered my favorite takeout on the day we found out. On the D&amp;C day I wasn&#39;t hungry and just slept. </p>

<p>Grief is not linear, you may feel better if you celebrate today or the weekend or next week. You may not feel like yourself for a while and you may feel fine and then not fine and then fine again -- over and over for longer than you feel is &quot;okay&quot;. </p>

<p>My husband and I booked a little long weekend trip over the due date of my first miscarriage, to take some time to reconnect / make a positive out of what we were sure was going to be a shitty day. I ended up miscarrying for the second time at 10 wks, 6 days before the first due date so the trip was extra needed because the date felt extra extra crappy. While, bleeding my way through our little reconnect trip was not what I had envisioned, it really did help to make the due date less crappy. </p>

<p>For the due date, of the second miscarriage, my husband was away for work so I spent the day with some girlfriends - and it actually didn&#39;t feel as crappy as I expected.</p>

<p>When I was in my early 20s I worked as a supervisor and I knew that one of my employees was early in her pregnancy. One day I could tell she wasn‚Äôt feeling right. She said she wanted to go home. I said ‚ÄúAre you suuuure? You wanna wait it out longer and see?‚Äù She said ok but a few minutes later she said she could tell something was wrong so I told her to leave and get checked out. She she lost the baby. I don‚Äôt remember once asking her if she was ok. Asking if she needed anything. I was so ignorant that I had no idea what she was going through. I thought you just weren‚Äôt pregnant anymore. I didn‚Äôt know you had to pass the pregnancy and her body and mind was in agony. I couldn‚Äôt fathom any of this.

<p>When I was in the hospital my high risk doctor mentioned that the issue was likely due to being pregnant with twins and that if I got pregnant again with a singleton then I‚Äôd likely be fine. But when I went for my 6 week postpartum check my doctor told me the same; next time I‚Äôll still be monitored by high risk, I could have a cerclage and I‚Äôd get progesterone as well. She also wouldn‚Äôt say that the problem was directly caused by twins, that it could be an issue with me. Which I‚Äôm sure you can understand just makes me feel great üòë.</p>

The women aren‚Äôt the only ones going through infertility. And high stress situations like this can hinder the mood. It really can kill the libido.

I would say continue to track your cycle. But actively try to hide it from him. That way it‚Äôs not in his head. And ensure you have together time throughout the month, not just peak fertility. You know about when that will be, so give it 3 days or so before peak day so he has time to recharge completely.

Yes, it‚Äôs a woman‚Äôs body, I know. But you said yourself he has been there every step of the way by your side. And as you are hurting and reeling, so is he.  And add to that his natural instinct as a man to protect you... which he is failing in completely. He has to watch you suffer and hurt with no way at all to protect you.

Or maybe he feels like this pregnancy path has surpassed him as your priority.  Like everything is  about getting pregnant and he is a means to an end. Unappreciated. I‚Äôm not saying this is the situation, only a possible way he could be reading it. Hiding the tracking from him keeps it out of sight. And regular intimacy will help heal that connection. He may know on some level when the peak days are, but if no attention is brought to it, it shouldn‚Äôt bother him.

Or it could just be the stress. Maybe plan a short get away for both of you to recharge your batteries. Continue to track, but don‚Äôt make it obvious or bring it up. Take the time to relax and destress. And if it happens to fall on your peak days, maybe get some drinks and be together, without reminding him it‚Äôs peak days or how important it is. 

Just my 2 cents as a husband that has gone through this. It is definitely not indicative of him not wanting to be a father.

<p>It&#39;s been a long 2 weeks. I&#39;ve had to stay strong this week in particular as it was my daughters 1st birthday on the 3rd and her birthday party yesterday. Knowing I could miscarry at any time (I started bleeding wednesday).</p>

<p>I have a scan tuesday to confirm everything is out. Felt so overwhelmed today now that I finally passed it, it&#39;s almost like a massive weight of pressure and anxiety has been lifted but i&#39;m left with a strange empty feeling. </p>

<p>Still cramping and bleeding but hoping the worst is over. </p>

<p>Ready to move on and start trying again so joined this group. Hope we all have short lived journeys here xx</p>
