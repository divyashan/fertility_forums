Once we announced I felt like I had given myself permission to finally be excited.  I was still scared the last three weeks until she got here, but I also felt a weight had lifted.</p>

So I \*just\* got mine last week. I am completely terrified. I told people a little earlier with the one I lost (8-9w) than I did with my LC (13-14w). I had a hard time getting pregnant with my LC, and was naive enough to think that \*that\* was the hard part, so with the 2nd I told people early. I'm not entirely sure it was a mistake, but it was definitely a kick in the pants when I lost the baby. This time around I have told a veeeeery small number of people who knew about the loss - a few women who have their own loss experiences and rallied around me when I needed it most this spring. Our families don't know yet, and I'm torn about what to do there. I'm inclined to wait until I have an ultrasound (which they won't do until 11 weeks... ughhhh).

<p>So I *just* got mine last week. I am completely terrified. I told people a little earlier with the one I lost (8-9w) than I did with my LC (13-14w). I had a hard time getting pregnant with my LC, and was naive enough to think that *that* was the hard part, so with the 2nd I told people early. I&#39;m not entirely sure it was a mistake, but it was definitely a kick in the pants when I lost the baby. This time around I have told a veeeeery small number of people who knew about the loss - a few women who have their own loss experiences and rallied around me when I needed it most this spring. Our families don&#39;t know yet, and I&#39;m torn about what to do there. I&#39;m inclined to wait until I have an ultrasound (which they won&#39;t do until 11 weeks... ughhhh). On the one hand, having the support and understanding I think is really important. On the other, it damn near broke my heart to have to tell my parents about the loss, and I don&#39;t know that I can stomach that again.  </p>

I've seen this sentiment around here and other forums quite a bit -- that the only reasons to wait even one cycle are emotional ones.

<p>This makes two cycles that I had a BD on my ovulation day (confirmed with LH strips) and BFN :( I know lots of people have been trying a lot longer than I have, but my husband and I got pregnant the first time after coming off BC on one go and we weren‚Äôt even actively trying. I lost that baby at 8w and it‚Äôs just so frustrating because now we realize how much we want to have a baby together</p>

We did not have any questions for our dr at the start, as we didn't know what was going on. The dr literally tested everything, asked so many questions, looked at old scans and medical reports. We were there for well over an hour. Then we had karyotype tests, STI tests, blood tests, sperm test, and also found out I have thrombophilia so genetic risk assessment of that.

I'd had lots of ultrasounds since my 1st mc but noone had picked up that there was anything wrong with my uterus. She looked at an old ultrasound and spotted something and I had a hysteroscopy to confirm that I have PID, believed to be from a complication with the d&c after my first miscarriage which was believed to be linked to antibiotics I was on (not knowing I was pregnant). Because of PID implantation wasn't happening properly causing the mcs. I had been to several different gynaecologists and nobody had picked anything up.

Anyway moral of the story, the fertility/ miscarriage specialist should be testing everything and when you first meet them they won't have any answers because part of their job is doing all of the tests to try and figure it out.

Hcg 19,000 down to 11,000 in 6 days. 
June 13 mife/miso bled for a week, spotted for a week. 
June 20ish down to 32hcg
June 30 down to 5hcg (I didn‚Äôt bother going back to zero because 5 is so close to negative clearly no tissue left in there) 
I took opks but they were all like, not super faint but not positive. I assume I didn‚Äôt ovulate but still had a surge.
July 16 got my first period since the Mc. It was 3 says total, really heavy 1 day and spotting/nothing after that. I didn‚Äôt have sore boobs or cramps or any usual pms symptoms. 

Gave it my all tracking opks desperately trying to get pregnant got a high/my peak August 1 on CD 16 so ovulated I assume the 17 (again if I ovulated I don‚Äôt temp) banged it out like crazy and started spotting on 9 dpo and cramping and then got my period 10dpo. Crazy cramps, sore boobs, but again super light spotting and way lighter than my usual. 
My LP was short and with the spotting I‚Äôm not sure what‚Äôs going on clearly still weird hormones. 

I am now cd13 and no positive opks yet. Just having lots of sex and trying to test a few times a day. 

A week ago I started a pill regiment of: prenatals, vitamin b6, vitamin e, vitamin c, vitamin d, fish oils, and just got zinc in the mail today. I‚Äôve also been exercising daily, no coffee and no alcohol. I‚Äôve been drinking a shot glass of pomegranate juice as well. 

I assume either my hormones are still fucked or my uterine wall isn‚Äôt thick enough.  Doing everything I can to improve both. I do feel a lot mentally better working out though I am doing a workout program just started week 2 and it‚Äôs nice to focus on something else other than ttc and loss. 

I know this sounds ridiculous but I just need to feel like I‚Äôm doing something. Getting my first period sucked seeing blood again  and then my second was worse because my hormones were all over the map again. Everyone says you‚Äôre so fertile after a loss and I used that dream as a crutch instead of coping properly I guess.

We're in Chicago, with specialists everywhere. I have a few friends with a fertility specialist who tells them to come in after two early losses or one late term loss ( I wish I would have found her after mine!). So I don't think wanting extra care or asking extra questions here is unreasonable.

Mostly, my reasoning i was given to wait was it was easier to date the pregnancy. My doctor confirmed that there does seem to be increased fertility after miscarriage, but the science isn't there to back up causation. I also asked about uterine lining being too thin and she told me ""you wouldn't get pregnant if that is the case"". Not sure of if there is science there.

These doctors were also great at listening to my google research! I'd come in nervous to say ""hey I found this on google"" but they listened (probably due to my past). BUT if you can bring in any peer reviewed articles (maybe even abstracts) to support anything you're concerned about hopefully they listen. I also found younger doctors to have better bedside manner and a more open mind.

Initially I felt I was completely ready and that focusing on the future would help me heal and it does to an extent, although I've found myself really struggling for the past week as I am taking 2 OPK tests per day because I don't know when I will ovulate on my new cycle and every negative test is breaking me a little more. 

I'm testing twice a day as I'm not sure if I will have a shorter ovulation window at the 12 hour end and would prefer not to miss an opportunity, but I'd also like to understand my new cycles now that the dates are all different and help me prepare for my first period after. 

I am physically OK and in my head I know I'm OK but I'm really struggling with my emotions. I'm finding the process all a bit draining because I was already pregnant and feel like its cruel/unfair that I'm having to do all this again. 

I hope you're doing OK, and if you want to try straight away and feel it's the right thing for you and your other half and you're ready you should, but just be prepared your feelings might not do what you thought they would when you do start.

I wish I could be excited but I‚Äôm freaking terrified because I had spotting despite progesterone (although spotting seems to be gone now) and I‚Äôm 13dpo and everything before now was a stark white line so I had a few drinks in the past few days. I am feeling so guilty and scared and am so worried that if this is another chemical that means there is a larger problem that can‚Äôt be solved by IVF. And if it is another chemical that will delay us getting started on IVF. It would be amazing to have a free sex baby but I don‚Äôt have much hope.</p>

I&#39;m only on CD4, so not sure how long it will or won&#39;t go on. </p>

<p>I do wonder, though, if the brown blood is just post-sexy times (sometimes if your cervix gets bumped, some old blood can make an appearance) and hopefully it doesn&#39;t mean your period is continuing.</p>

To answer your question: I was one of those patients who had zero complications or complaints before the surgery. I actually had my IUD for 1 year and on top of that had the common side effect of having no periods. So no pain, no bleeding, no heavy periods, and no cramps. The doctor discovered it during my first routine internal scan. Pure coincidence.

During the operation they of course first removed my IUD. 2-4 days after the surgery my period started. Afterwards it was just normal periods. No cramps or excessive bleeding. In fact, they only last max 4 days, compared to the year before when 8-10 days was normal to me.

And I read a lot before my surgery. Apparently 3 months is a good minimum of recovery time. It also depends on where the fibroid is. I actually ran a 5k 4 months after my surgery. Just imagine.

I really believe 3 months is fine as long as you take your recovery seriously. Walk, walk and walk some more. Start running, biking.

<p>During the operation they of course first removed my IUD. 2-4 days after the surgery my period started. Afterwards it was just normal periods. No cramps or excessive bleeding. In fact, they only last max 4 days, compared to the year before when 8-10 days was normal to me.</p>

<p>And I read a lot before my surgery. Apparently 3 months is a good minimum of recovery time. It also depends on where the fibroid is. I actually ran a 5k 4 months after my surgery. Just imagine.</p>

<p>I really believe 3 months is fine as long as you take your recovery seriously. Walk, walk and walk some more. Start running, biking. Anything that stimulates the blood flow from your legs to your uturus. It&#39;s the key to recovery!</p>

Make sure to wear like dresses or high waist underwear. At least above the incision. I bought really baggy clothes and they definitely helped me be extra at ease.

I wanted to update everyone on my progress through this difficult time. To sum up my previous cycle:

July 22 & 23 - positive HPT's
July 24 - my RE office had me come in for labs - beta hCG and progesterone. A few hours later I got the news that, while my beta was OK at 28.9, my progesterone was low at 1.9 and I was most likely having a CP.
July 25: Started spotting. My Dr. checked my labs every 2-3 days to be sure no surgical intervention was needed. 
By July 30, my beta was negative. 

I was only 3w+6d pregnant when the spotting began, but it was still a heavy blow. I spent that weekend crying on & off, and constantly thinking about ""what if's"". What if I hadn't had that chai latte when I was (unknowingly) 2w along? What if my anxiety over my sister's mental health hadn't upset me so much when I was about 3w? If I had better control over my anxiety, I wouldn't have to continue on Zoloft (with my RE's blessing), but maybe that would've made all the difference?! 

The weekend that I visibly started to lose the pregnancy, I emailed my RE's office with some questions, and asked for a response early the following week (during regular business hours). I sent the email late Saturday; bless him, my doctor called me on Sunday morning. He explained to me the biochemical process my body was going through, and that - with us succeeding on our second cycle of Femara + trigger shot + timed intercourse - this was all good indication that we would be successful in future cycles of TI, perhaps adding in IUI if we didn't have success again soon. He acknowledged that this was a difficult time, and wanted me to take a month off from treatment. But overall, he did a fantastic job of instilling hope and showing me the silver lining of our loss. 

I've been seeing a therapist throughout this process (have been for some time), but these most recent visits have been really tough. There's been a lot of discussion of unpacking the ""what if's"" and making sense of it all. I'm still healing, and so is my husband. But we are ready to try again. Our next cycle is scheduled to begin next week - this time with close lab monitoring (like every 2-3 days throughout the cycle) and progesterone support, if necessary.

My previous dr is adamant my pregnancy is not viable. He told me that 4 times now, based only on hcg tests and ONE U/S. 

Last Monday, based on LMP, I would have been 6 weeks exactly. During a TVS, he found nothing (at one moment, he found a very faint round structure and said that maybe that was the failed gestational sac). He told me to stop utrogestan (I have low progesterone and luteal defect) and wait for the miscarriage.

Fast forward to last Friday. Zero bleeding/spotting, zero pain, zero cramps. He sent me to an imaging clinic to rule out ectopic pregnancy. During the new U/S, this time abdominal, the sonographer saw a very visible, 5mm gestational sac that was most definitely not there on Monday. He insisted it was normal (I asked A LOT of times) but dated it at 5w2d (I should have been 6w4d).

New hcg taken on the same day showed a very small rise (825 to 1081 in 4 days). Dr is still insisting it is not viable, is pushing me to take Cytotec, and was very touchy about me not trusting his judgement. FFS, he was the one who sent me to the sonographer, and hell yes I do not trust his judgement anymore. I think he is rushing things (he could be right and I know it, but he‚Äôs pushing me to terminate my pregnancy, which he told was failed last Monday and clearly is not, and I‚Äôm just not sure).

So today I phoned a new doctor. She told me that sometimes a pregnancy seems abnormal but ends up being perfectly fine. She agreed to more testing, and even without me being her patient referred me to a clinic to get a new U/S.

At this point, I am not expecting anything, but I‚Äôm so glad that she listened to me that I‚Äôm switching to be under her care, regardless of the outcome.

I am so angry that my previous dr is pushing me to terminate üò° he first said that I had a MMC, but it is clearly not the case. An embryo doesn‚Äôt grow 5mm in 5 days if it‚Äôs dead.

Next U/S is this coming Friday. So far I had a very light spotting since Saturday (sonographer detected a bleeding but said it was not cause for concern), and since yesterday I‚Äôm having very very faint cramps. So I‚Äôm not worried I‚Äôm actually passing anything at the moment.

Yesterday I read quite a few stories about miscarriage and blighted ovum misdiagnoses. Why doctors are in such a hurry to terminate non viable pregnancies anyway? Without further testing? Just because it‚Äôs not textbook doesn‚Äôt necessarily mean it‚Äôs doomed.

Also, no one EVER even considered if I could have ovulated later than expected. Even though I had viable follicles seen on TVS on CD12 and had a peak OPK on CD13, I learned that it‚Äôs a possibility that ovulation might have happened later. And that shift in timeframe would explain A LOT.

Has anyone been through anything similar? I‚Äôm not saying that my pregnancy is definitely viable, but the data available are insufficient to give such a bombastic diagnose.",[],,t1_g1uko5j,False,0,[],False,"<div class=""md""><p>I think I was misdiagnosed.</p>

<p>My previous dr is adamant my pregnancy is not viable. He told me that 4 times now, based only on hcg tests and ONE U/S. </p>

<p>Last Monday, based on LMP, I would have been 6 weeks exactly. During a TVS, he found nothing (at one moment, he found a very faint round structure and said that maybe that was the failed gestational sac). He told me to stop utrogestan (I have low progesterone and luteal defect) and wait for the miscarriage.</p>

<p>Fast forward to last Friday. Zero bleeding/spotting, zero pain, zero cramps. He sent me to an imaging clinic to rule out ectopic pregnancy. During the new U/S, this time abdominal, the sonographer saw a very visible, 5mm gestational sac that was most definitely not there on Monday. He insisted it was normal (I asked A LOT of times) but dated it at 5w2d (I should have been 6w4d).</p>

<p>New hcg taken on the same day showed a very small rise (825 to 1081 in 4 days). Dr is still insisting it is not viable, is pushing me to take Cytotec, and was very touchy about me not trusting his judgement. FFS, he was the one who sent me to the sonographer, and hell yes I do not trust his judgement anymore. I think he is rushing things (he could be right and I know it, but he‚Äôs pushing me to terminate my pregnancy, which he told was failed last Monday and clearly is not, and I‚Äôm just not sure).</p>

Can I just rant for a second about how disillusioned I am by the whole medical community? 

Since my son's premature birth and neonatal death, I have a 12 month wait before I can safely attempt another transfer (classical c section healing time). I'm currently 5 months in, and I'm focusing my time on getting my health in order (physical and mental). I've had so much testing done, and a few unknowns have been identifed, like an MTHFR mutation, but the main underlying issue to all my health issues is my insulin resistant PCOS (PCOS diagnosed at 19, insulin resistance has been known for a few years). 

In all my years of treatment for all the issues that insulin resistance and PCOS cause (and obviously the fertility issues in the past few years) I have only ever been treated medicinally. The pill, metformin, gonal F, estrogen, progesterone etc. Vague instructions to lose weight, but no further support when following a typical 'healthy' diet and exercise showed little no results, other scepticism about whether I was telling the truth. Also being told that there was no specific dietary recommendations to support my fertility treatment. I was only borderline overweight, so it must all be fine (side note, it took a lot of work to only be just overweight).

After years of having my insulin resistance dismissed as not that important, then being identified as a potential major factor in my son's birth, I finally have a medical team I trust. I am now being treated by a doctor who specialises in metabolic disorders (insulin resistance, type 2 diabetes) and am being treated primarily nutritionally, with some supplementation but nothing prescription. And now? I'm having cycles (28-35 days) compared to 1-2 per year. I'm losing weight without cutting calories at all. My fasting insulin and glucose are good, and my fatty liver markers have dramatically improved. And I have learned that doctors are not trained in nutrition, unless they seek out further education in it. And yet they speak with such authority.

And worse still, the same doctors that dismissed my insulin resistant, specific dietary changes, natural supplements etc are now telling me that I need to be careful with contraception with the plan that I am on as all these measures are known to potentially restore fertility in PCOS patients, and pregnancy so soon after my section is dangerous. IM SORRY, WHAT? Then why the fuck weren't these measures put in place during my treatment? 

Now I'm not naive enough to think that, given a previous AMH of 43.2 (308 if you're in Aus) and egg quality issues, that I would have not needed fertility treatment, but it could have been less treatment, or less extreme levels of treatment. I could have not needed to induce every treatment cycle medically and had 'natural' start treatment cycles. 

I don't know where I'm going with this, I'm just pissed off.",[],,t1_g1q2vbj,False,0,[],False,"<div class=""md""><p>I shared this in the infertility thread, but I am still pissed.</p>

<p>Can I just rant for a second about how disillusioned I am by the whole medical community? </p>

<p>Since my son&#39;s premature birth and neonatal death, I have a 12 month wait before I can safely attempt another transfer (classical c section healing time). I&#39;m currently 5 months in, and I&#39;m focusing my time on getting my health in order (physical and mental). I&#39;ve had so much testing done, and a few unknowns have been identifed, like an MTHFR mutation, but the main underlying issue to all my health issues is my insulin resistant PCOS (PCOS diagnosed at 19, insulin resistance has been known for a few years). </p>

<p>In all my years of treatment for all the issues that insulin resistance and PCOS cause (and obviously the fertility issues in the past few years) I have only ever been treated medicinally. The pill, metformin, gonal F, estrogen, progesterone etc. Vague instructions to lose weight, but no further support when following a typical &#39;healthy&#39; diet and exercise showed little no results, other scepticism about whether I was telling the truth. Also being told that there was no specific dietary recommendations to support my fertility treatment. I was only borderline overweight, so it must all be fine (side note, it took a lot of work to only be just overweight).</p>

<p>After years of having my insulin resistance dismissed as not that important, then being identified as a potential major factor in my son&#39;s birth, I finally have a medical team I trust. I am now being treated by a doctor who specialises in metabolic disorders (insulin resistance, type 2 diabetes) and am being treated primarily nutritionally, with some supplementation but nothing prescription. And now? I&#39;m having cycles (28-35 days) compared to 1-2 per year. I&#39;m losing weight without cutting calories at all. My fasting insulin and glucose are good, and my fatty liver markers have dramatically improved. And I have learned that doctors are not trained in nutrition, unless they seek out further education in it. And yet they speak with such authority.</p>

<p>And worse still, the same doctors that dismissed my insulin resistant, specific dietary changes, natural supplements etc are now telling me that I need to be careful with contraception with the plan that I am on as all these measures are known to potentially restore fertility in PCOS patients, and pregnancy so soon after my section is dangerous. IM SORRY, WHAT? Then why the fuck weren&#39;t these measures put in place during my treatment? </p>

I could have not needed to induce every treatment cycle medically and had &#39;natural&#39; start treatment cycles. </p>

You need cheerleaders now more than ever. 

So me: I have anxiety and mild OCD. I also have recently diagnosed PTSD from my miscarriage. 

Something interesting my therapist said to me this week which sat with me and because you mentioned you have a good career, own a home etc. 

She said in the past anxiety has served you and pushed you do well ... studying more because you were worried about doing bad in an exam result getting good grades. Stressing about getting a good job meant more time  studying and applying for roles... result getting a good job... working hard at your job to prove yourself. result good career and more money. It‚Äôs a distorted learned thought... if I worry I try harder and I get positive results. If I don‚Äôt worry then bad things happen to me. The issue is with these things especially pregnancy and miscarriage it is so out of our control the anxiety does not serve you in anyway to get a positive result. 

A lot of this is obviously specific to me but maybe you can draw something from it. 

Reading from your OP those two week waits without your medication aren‚Äôt great for you and you need support. Going on and off the medication must be sending your body into overdrive. I would first speak to doctors to see what plan they can put in place now you are ttc in regards to dosage and typeS of medication that‚Äôs safe. 

Then this is what I have done: found a therapist who specialises in miscarriage, found an acupuncturist, meditating at home every day for 10 mins, massage once every few weeks, exercise once a day for 10-20 mins. And then cut down on alcohol and caffeine and junk food. It‚Äôs been a lot of work and I‚Äôve only been doing it for about 2 weeks but I‚Äôve noticed I‚Äôm a lot more stable and I‚Äôm picking up on times when I start to spiral which I couldn‚Äôt do before.

So, technically luteal bleeding counts as 'intermenstrual bleeding' and we have a standard set of investigations we do. These include thyroid function, a CBC, an exam and cervical smear, and an ultrasound for endometrial thickness. 

The purpose of the investigations is to a) look for the things we think are likely to be the cause, and b) rule out the really rare and serious things that could be the cause, however unlikely they may be. 

For this reason we update people's cervical smear to make sure there's no sign of precancerous changes of the cervix. And the reason they look at the endometrial thickness is to check that it's not overly thickened, which can rarely be caused by endometrial hyperplasia or endometrial cancer. 

Now, endometrial cancer is almost entirely an old person's disease, and a bit of luteal spotting in someone young enough to be breast feeding will definitely not be that. I order about one of these a week and Ive never seen an scary abnormal result in someone pre-menopause. But we just do all the investigations for everyone, regardless of risk, to make absolutely sure we don't miss anything.

My mom is sincerely trying to be empathetic, but I am also her only daughter and she is...  Our relationship has always been slightly backwards.  My mom is a fragile person and has always been, since I was very young.  I understood early that she couldn&#39;t bear the weight of my emotions or traumas and that I was better able to be there for her than she was for me.  I&#39;ve long since accepted that.  And so when I had a MMC in July, my mom was the last person I really wanted to go in depth with about my pain.  She was grieving too and I know she just isn&#39;t equipped to be there for me.  But this is probably the first time in my life something has hurt me in a way that is deeper than her pain over it.

Hashi's is pretty frustrating as far as TTC but there's a LOT of research surrounding HYPO and TTC.

1. You didn't say how old you are. If your thyroid is ""messed up"", it would probably behoove you to fix it as I know having Hashi's can make it really, really difficult to conceive.

2. I think you need to have your levels drawn first to see where they are and if they are normal (your progesterone).

I think the options have been covered so I‚Äôll just say my experience/preference (I personally wanted to see thoughts from lots of people before deciding).

TLDR: one MMC with D&C (IV sedation), one MMC misoprostol - 4 days later Hospital stay/emergency D&C due to retained products/infection. Will now always wait 1 week and then D&C.

‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî

My first MMC was discovered at 12 weeks, about 8 weeks fetal age. My doctor recommended waiting for a week to see if natural would occur (although it had already been 3-4 weeks at this point) and then choose medical (misoprostol) or D&C. I was warned D&C can be very painful and I would be prescribed narcotics. D&C I could either have it in their office (no sedation) or at a clinic (IV sedation. I‚Äôm absolutely not comfortable having a D&C without sedation so I opted for the clinic with IV sedation.

I was extremely anxious leading up to it, but once they started sedation I felt like I fell asleep (similar to when I had a endoscopy). I woke up afterwards and other then some intense cramping (like heavy period cramps) for 15-20 minutes and normal bleeding I felt alright.

My send MMC was during Covid - 6-7 weeks gestation. This time the options were natural, medical, or D&C in their clinic with no sedation (anti anxiety med/ibuprofen).

Being in the beginning of Covid - I think the clinic I went to last time was closed. So I waited a week to give natural a chance and then decided to go medical.

I picked a day, set myself up and started the medication. I may have a pain diary I could go refer to if you want specifics but essentially it was 6-8 hours of moderate/strong  cramping (like really bad period cramps) and then 30-45 minutes of more intense cramping that essentially I couldn‚Äôt do anything but rock back and forth and sob (I was perscribed Norco which I had taken as well as Tylenol in between doses). After that there was a decent amount of bleeding and the pain essentially went away.

Unfortunately 4-5 days later I suddenly spiked a fever of 101+ and ended up in urgent care. I was sent to the Covid section so risked exposure. They confirmed I had an infection due to retained products and was admitted to the hospital for 2-3 days for IV antibiotics and D&C (this time in OR so full anesthesia).

If I have another MMC, I will wait the week, and do a D&C with IV Sedation. If that still isn‚Äôt  offered as an option during Covid I will push more about it. I‚Äôm not comfortable with doing a D&C without sedation.

Hope this helps you make a decision. At the end of the day I made it through the tough parts of the second MMC, but I wouldn‚Äôt choose to do it again.

I wouldn't assume that your period fluctuations are due to multiple cps. It's a possibility but it can take a while for cycles to become regular after birth control. And stress right before your ovulation time can cause delayed ovulation which then means a delayed period.

You are definitely not alone! More than likely you will go on to have a successful pregnancy and while you won't forget the joy and sadness this one brought you, the ache will dull with time and healing.

<p>I wouldn&#39;t assume that your period fluctuations are due to multiple cps. It&#39;s a possibility but it can take a while for cycles to become regular after birth control. And stress right before your ovulation time can cause delayed ovulation which then means a delayed period.</p>

<p>You are definitely not alone! More than likely you will go on to have a successful pregnancy and while you won&#39;t forget the joy and sadness this one brought you, the ache will dull with time and healing.</p>

<p>TW loss mention, living child mention:</p>

<p>I lost my firstborn shortly after birth and then had a chemical a few months later. Once I was pregnant again, it was hard to believe nothing would go wrong. But everything went perfectly and I had a ton of support, as well as group therapy and individual therapy. But everything was perfect and I had a beautiful daughter who is now two.</p>

We decided to continue trying naturally. Honestly, I think both decisions made sense, but I just went with my gut which told me to keep trudging along. One thing that made me shy away from IVF, at least for now, was that my one MMC was chromosomally normal. So would have been the kind of embryo that potentially would get transferred during IVF and I still miscarried. I‚Äôve made a bunch of ‚Äúlifestyle‚Äù changes like trying to avoid fragrance, avoid plastic, use more natural products, and really stepped up my supplement game after reading it starts with the egg. Who knows what will happen but it feels like the right choice for now. I know it‚Äôs so hard. I hope you get some clarity! I am so so sorry for your loss. It‚Äôs honestly the fucking WORST. </p>

<p>We tried again this month, I‚Äôll know by next week if I‚Äôm pregnant- fingers crossed!</p>

‚ÄúMy body was designed to conceive‚Äù
‚ÄúMy eggs are healthy and developing perfectly‚Äù
‚ÄúMy womb is strong, healthy, and nourishing‚Äù

<p>Mediation; I love the meditation mini podcast. They‚Äôre short and all different. I haven‚Äôt listened in a few years, but after my last loss, they were very helpful at helping me reach a more zen daily life.</p>

<p>Acupuncture; I went to a fertility specific acupuncturist and she did a lot of treatment for my anxiety as well. I would practice some of the meditations while sitting with the needles in (they don‚Äôt hurt) and I found it super helpful. </p>

<p>Exercise is also amazing. Whatever you like and can do is what‚Äôs best. I love to run. I like taking dance classes. I joined a boxing gym after my first loss and really liked punching something physical. Yoga, CrossFit, lifting weight...it will all help reduce stress. Just pick which one you like best.</p>

I‚Äôm CD 2 and I‚Äôve been a mess this last week and I‚Äôve had to really step back and take a hard look at myself this past 24 hours. My husband had told me he is worried about me and I‚Äôve realised I need help. The continued anxiety and depression that I put onto my body is not going to help me get pregnant and even if I do I am going to struggle throughout the entire pregnancy/ parenthood because I will worry it will happen again. Additionally it‚Äôs affecting my relationship and will continue to do so until I deal with these issues. 

This is what my plan looks like so far (maybe some of it will be helpful):
1. Find a therapist / councillor who specialises in miscarriage or grief
2. Meditate once a day (I‚Äôm using calm app)
3. Go out once a day for a walk 
4. Spend quality time once a day with husband that doesn‚Äôt involve pregnancy/ babies (a project is good, make/ build something, start a course, gardening, watch a good tv show together etc.)
5. Reduce outside stresses. For example. I have found a cleaner to clean some bits of the house which my husband and I usually fight over. 
6. Read before bed and leave phone downstairs from 9pm. 
7. Have something to look forward to every week that isn‚Äôt pregnancy related (meeting up with a friend, going somewhere cool for a walk, trying a new recipe). Make that your focus in the week. 

Reduce highs and lows
1. Drink more water

I‚Äôm CD 2 and I‚Äôve been a mess this last week and I‚Äôve had to really step back and take a hard look at myself this past 24 hours. My husband had told me he is worried about me and I‚Äôve realised I need help. The continued anxiety and depression that I put onto my body is not going to help me get pregnant and even if I do I am going to struggle throughout the entire pregnancy/ parenthood because I will worry it will happen again. Additionally it‚Äôs affecting my relationship and will continue to do so until I deal with these issues. </p>

<p>This is what my plan looks like so far (maybe some of it will be helpful):
1. Find a therapist / councillor who specialises in miscarriage or grief
2. Meditate once a day (I‚Äôm using calm app)
3. Go out once a day for a walk 
4. Spend quality time once a day with husband that doesn‚Äôt involve pregnancy/ babies (a project is good, make/ build something, start a course, gardening, watch a good tv show together etc.)
5. Reduce outside stresses. For example. I have found a cleaner to clean some bits of the house which my husband and I usually fight over. 
6. Read before bed and leave phone downstairs from 9pm. 
7. Have something to look forward to every week that isn‚Äôt pregnancy related (meeting up with a friend, going somewhere cool for a walk, trying a new recipe). Make that your focus in the week. </p>

<p>Reduce highs and lows
1. Drink more water
2.Reduce alcohol and coffee
3. Eat more fish and vegetables and less sugars 
4. Stop/ limit fast food</p>

I just saw an RE last Monday! They drew my blood, give me a 30 minute biology lecture on the entire menstrual cycle (as if I'm not nearly 30 with degree and a Master's on the way) and then asked me about my lifestyle habits. It was told that I should lose some weight as it could personally be affecting my ability to carry but the RE had no definitive answers just speculation (this advice was also given since my mother had GD).

RE got me in the stirrups, did a transvaginal ultrasound and said, and I quote, ""You have a beautiful uterus!"" 

Followed by ""Look at the endometrial lining. You are literally textbook!"" To which he pointed to a chart on his wall (actually his nurse did) and then pointed to my ultrasound and repeated that I, once again, had a textbook endometrial lining (""perfect"", his words). 

He then proceeded to check ALL of my follicles, told me how beautiful my largest follicle was. Told me I had the exact amount of follicles he expected I would. Told me I'd ovulate either within the hour or the next 24 - he wasn't sure. 

I was then told ""go have sex, call us at 10 DPO so we know the results.""

I was also given a list of tests such as autoimmune blood testing, karyotyping, and something else that I can't quite remember.

The ONLY THING that consultation provided to me was peace of mind KNOWING that I not only have a textbook uterus (minus the missing fallopian tube and ovary on one side), I have a perfect endometrial lining and ""great"" follicles. This WAS beneficial in that I was concerned my body wasn't producing enough hormones pre-pregnancy. 

This rules out that my issues isn't pre-pregnancy, and it's not actually getting pregnant, it's just likely just staying pregnant. 

My RE pointed out that this isn't a terrible problem to have and it's likely my 2 CPs in a row (and three in a year) were total flukes and ""they just happen"". 

He stressed again that my uterus had no septate, my fallopian tube wasn't blocked and that there is nothing physically preventing me from getting pregnant. By his induction, he reasoned, it's a total crap shoot and because I'm actively trying to get pregnant, I'm finding my miscarriages when most women don't even know they're pregnant. 

It should be noted that none of my pregnancies were ""clinical"" as in, seen on a U/S. I keep having CPs that end a couple days into the 4 week mark which he (currently) attributes to just genetic anomalies. 

So, if for whatever reason, my testing comes back normal and I'm still not able to maintain pregnancy (after some arbitrary amount of time), our best bet is to do IVF so we can skip the whole CP thing, get me on proper pregnancy support hormones with a ""good"" zygote and be on our merry way.

I was told to call the clinic at 10DPO with the results so they can provide me hormonal support (just in case). 

To repeat what my RE said: ""A woman who has six losses still has the opportunity to go on and have a normal, healthy pregnancy just as a woman who has had none.""

On top of this, I was diagnosed with type 1 diabetes, that my endocrinologist suspects was caused by the first pregnancy/miscarriage and likely then caused the second. I fell pregnant again in May and was CERTAIN that this would be the one-- but lost it at 8 weeks again and had to undergo a D&amp;C. my diabetes is fully controlled with the A1C of a non diabetic, so my doc&#39;s are sure it likely had nothing to do with the third loss. I&#39;m now waiting to get into a RPL program at the fertility clinic, which is taking AGES, and also dealing with the prejudices of the medical community (refusing to do tests on my husband because &quot;you can get your wife pregnant&quot; so it obviously has to be MY fault, as the woman... Completely discounting things like sperm quality and DNA fragmentation). I&#39;m just super tired and frustrated, and angry that my body feels &quot;broken&quot; and that I can&#39;t do the most basic thing that women are supposed to be able to do. Sigh.</p>

I swear by Clearblue Advanced Digitals as they give me a really good heads up to my FW, and supplement them with cheapies for a more detailed view (I just use one CBAD a day, but when I get a peak I'll switch to testing on cheapies two or three times).  However, I think that provided you are getting a clear result with whatever you are using (as in, you don't have PCOS or some other issue that means you can't divine a clear positive during your cycle) it doesn't really matter what brand or type it is.  If you're looking to save money, you could try experimenting with cheapies alongside your Eveline to make sure that you're getting similar results that you can interpret.

Tracking temps is the at home method to confirm ovulation.  If you want to make sure you did ovulate when an OPK indicated, then seeing a temperature increase shortly after will indicate that it did happen.  This is because sometimes you can get a positive OPK, but it will not lead to actual ovulation.  Some people can have these 'false surges' which can mean that you might miss ovulation if you take your first positive as it for that cycle, hence the confirmation via the temperature rise.

IMHO if you have regular cycles (as in your period shows up around 14 days after you first believe you ovulated) then everything is most likely all fine and good, and temping is just the icing on the cake.  There is loads more you can get into re. temping - check out [Fertility Friend](https://www.fertilityfriend.com/courses/) for a course around it.

To be very clear, you don't **have** to do any/either of these methods to achieve success, and although it's a bit of an old chestnut, provided it didn't take you too long to conceive your loss, odds are good that you will be able to get pregnant again if you are having regular sex (i.e. two or three times a week).

It‚Äôs like when you first start your period, when you go off birth control, when you stop breastfeeding and after you are pregnant (including loss). It makes sense but it seems like people don‚Äôt talk about it so much so it comes as a surprise. </p>

<p>The weirdest thing for me is that my periods have been irregular my whole life and a doctor (without doing any tests) told me I would have a hard time getting pregnant because of it. I got pregnant the first time I tried and yet now my periods are regular but I‚Äôm on my 7th cycle. </p>

<p>I‚Äôve never heard of the legs swelling one before, that‚Äôs so interesting. I do get pain across my hips and down my legs now the day before my period. Our bodies are strange mysteries sometimes, that‚Äôs for sure! I wouldn‚Äôt be worried about not having noticeable pms symptoms, especially when it looks like you‚Äôre ovulating. Having hardcore pms symptoms was def not a good sign for me anyway.</p>
