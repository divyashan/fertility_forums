A year ago next week, I went through the same. My daughter’s heart just stopped when I was 28 weeks pregnant. She was born November 4th. Her sister was 3 and her brother was 1,5.

Both our living children saw their sister. They have no concept of death and for them it was ‘normal’. Stillborn babies at that gestation look just like newborns, just a bit smaller. I’m sure your daughter will be beautiful and your living daughter won’t be traumatized.

My oldest still talks about the hospital and the funeral. I’m so thankful she remembers. My son doesn’t, but he does know he has another sister. I’m sure there will be questions one day. We have a lot of pictures of our stillborn daughter and sometimes look at them with our children as well. We made as many memories as we possibly could in the short time we had.

There’s actually only one thing I really regret, and that is that we didn’t take pictures of our children together. My son won’t remember he saw her, my oldest might forget over time, and we won’t be able to show them they saw her.

In the end you know your daughter best, but remember she is a child and doesn’t have the same associations with death yet that adults have. If you don’t have your daughter see her sister, at least take lots and lots of pictures. (Several countries have good causes with professional photographers who come and take photographs for free in cases like ours.)

However, from my looking at some of the medical literature, it appears that they are probably mostly from egg quality issues.

<p>We are already trying again. This is our second cycle trying, third cycle after the loss. I’m hoping we’re successful this cycle. I’m about two months out from my loss, and some days are hard, but most days are a lot better now. There is no roadmap to grief, so just follow wherever your heart is taking you. Someone told me grief is like waves on the sea. At first, there are so many and they are so big. But over time, they’re fewer, and maybe they’re still tall or maybe they’re a little smaller. But you will survive. Feel free to look through my post history; there might be helpful stuff for you in there. Sending you all of my love and the biggest hugs. 💕 PM me anytime if you need someone to talk to.</p>

I'm going to try to be as thorough as I can but I'm on my phone and at a work conference right now.

I very much understand freaking out right now. You're grieving and you're in that limbo where this really could have just been a fluke, or it could be the start of a very long process. Overall, you probably will be fine without making any changes. Although the risk of T21 goes up with age, more younger women have T21 pregnancies just because of sheer numbers. It's also a good sign that you were able to get pregnant with your current cycle pattern.

However, it never hurts to get checked out, especially during a time when you're fragile and the reassurance could help. There are some good lists on the infertility subreddit FAQ about what you would want to check (a comprehensive initial fertility workup usually includes: CD3 labs including estradiol, FSH, AMH, TSH, testosterone and prolactin; a sperm analysis; an HSG to check your uterus and fallopian tubes), and there are actually some start ups and fertility doctors that will do initial virtual workups for a few hundred dollars. The ""Egg Whisperer"" doctor is one, and Modern Fertility is one of the companies. 

For general education about fertility, I recommend The Egg Whisperer (podcast, website, YouTube channel), and the podcast ""Beat Infertility"" (hunt through the archives for episodes that interest you). Both have really accessible overviews.

In terms of what you can do, Coq10 is a supplement that many people take to improve egg quality, and I took it for a few months before my IVF egg retrieval. At your age, 100mg of ubiquinol should be enough. You can also put your husband on it. Some people do special diets, like keto and low carb, but mostly those benefit those with PCOS and autoimmune problems.

If you're worried that your body's natural cycles are a little wonky, you can do a low dose of clomid or femara, which beef up your natural ovulation process. In some who naturally ovulates, unless there are sperm issues, you don't need to do an IUI and can still just do timed intercourse. However, I do not recommend doing these medications without a doctor who is monitoring your cycle because you can develop multiple follicles and be at risk for implanting 2+ embryos. 

There's also other supplements and things like acupuncture, but I don't know as much about those.

I hope that helps. ♥️",[],,t1_e8b46az,False,0,[],False,"<div class=""md""><p>Hey! I&#39;m going to try to be as thorough as I can but I&#39;m on my phone and at a work conference right now.</p>

Given my loss history and CD3 test results, my RE strongly suspected shitty eggs as the root of the problem. (We ended up doing a freeze all cycle, so in the end from 4 non-IVF pregnancies we were 2/4 on chromosome issues, and of our 4 blastocysts from the IVF cycle, 2 were PGS-normal - that gives me exactly a 50% ""that was never going to work out"" rate.) 

IVF+PGS is a way to get a selection of embryos and transfer one that you know to have no chromosomal abnormalities. IUI just helps you get pregnant. They can give drugs to help strengthen ovulation (and possibly make a slightly better egg?), but ultimately, you're rolling the dice on chromosomes exactly the same way you would if you were continuing to try on your own. You're also taking more time (at least 3 months, if not more) before you can get to IVF, a process which is already going to run you 2-3 months for a retrieval and transfer.

I would appeal citing medical necessity as others have suggested. If that is denied, I would ask yourself the following questions:

1. How much money would you save by doing the 3 IUI requirement (even with IVF coverage there is often still out of pocket expenses, and you may also have copays from the IUI)?

2. Are you willing and able to cover the cost of the IVF yourself if it means not having to wait?

3. I dont know your loss history, but if it's known chromosomes not compatible with life, are you comfortable risking up to 3 pregnancies and miscarriages to get the insurance benefit? Not saying this will happen, but if you were getting pregnant easily, IUI is also likely to get you pregnant. Without testing the embryo, you would have the same odds of a chromosome issue that you had previously. For me, that's 50/50. YMMV. 

Hopefully an insurance appeal will be approved so you don't have to make the choice, assuming you're comfortable with the idea of the IVF in the first place. I'm really sorry that you have to deal with any of this.

The 7 yo then started questioning me about why not and when I was going o have a baby. They know about my loss, I kept waiting for them to shut their kid up, but nope. A sad part of me thinks they got some satisfaction out of watching me squirm, like I deserve it. </p>

<p>Ready to go home.</p>

My body is dealing with a never ending suspected ectopic since 9/26. Got my methotrexate shot last week and go for a follow up tomorrow

Normally work is my first priority and I am shifting around things to make appointments work with my work schedule. I have flipped it this month. I told my boss about my situation and the need for testing, etc. she disclosed she struggled with infertility and tried IVF twice before her an her husband exhausted their finances. It was a heavy conversation. We learned a lot about each other and she is so understanding. She’s really an amazing person and I was so sad to hear everything that happened to her :( she said it was about 15 years ago.

Having her on my side is a huge blessing. I told her some days I wouldn’t have much notice when I needed to go to an appointment. She said “oh, I’ve been there! Good luck”. I decided to take off of work Monday to go to my follow up, get acupuncture and get my hair cut. 

I’ve also been spilling the beans to my close friends. In doing so, I learned that one of my friends was diagnosed with fibromyalgia, another had a rocky start to her pregnancy and had to have her cervix stitched shut— she is terrified every day. I also learned my sister in law also has the MTHFR mutation and she’s a pharmacist so she has some interesting insights. I told all my siblings and they sent me and my husband a gift card to a nice restaurant because “we deserve a nice night out”. My sister sent me surprise slippers. All the kindness and confessions made me feel less alone and so loved.

Absolutely be kind to yourself, but if your gut is telling you that you'd like more medical intervention, more knowledge, more test results, more imaging, then do it. Very few of the tests that they do actually have any kind of side effects-- short of getting an HSG (an x-ray with dye of your uterus) and even then, it's mostly just the radiation exposure of the x-ray. 

If you think you'd like more, go out and get more. Be your own advocate. If your doctor thinks it's too early, start researching fertility specialists in your area and then call them to ask if they'd take you on as a new patient. A lot of fertility specialists have Advanced Nurse Practitioners who can see you for a reduced rate, and a lot of what they do can be charged as preventative care, so your insurance should cover it if you have insurance.

Also, I think your friend was incredibly loving to tell your husband. It's not that you're a monster, it's that she knows how very, very sensitive this is for you. 

&#x200B;

Imagine the worst case-- for just a second-- that your friend lost her pregnancy pretty late in the game. Imagine that everything that could go wrong did, and your friend nearly died and her baby didn't make it. And then it happened again. And again. And again. But then, against all hope and against all odds, your friend had an alive baby and came out of labor and delivery feeling pretty healthy. Imagine how much love and care you'd feel for her to finally have an alive baby. Imagine how'd you'd have been there for her during each loss. Imagine that for every loss, you are the one who got to take home an alive baby. Would that change how you loved her during her trials? If that was the situation, you'd be shielding her from your overly-bright sun. 

&#x200B;

This isn't a zero-sum situation. She's pregnant and it's wonderful, but you are not, and that weighs heavily on your heart. Both situations exist at the same time in the same moment.

She's being considerate of how sensitive this is for you. She knows that the light of her joyous news will just throw all your dark places and your pain into sharp relief. It might be too much for you both to be in the same place at the same time right now. Her happiness might bubble over and drown you in grief, but... can you do something on your own that you can have delievered to her? 

&#x200B;

I handmade a baby quilt for my friend... whose rainbow baby was born within a couple weeks of my due date. I had 2 miscarriages while she was pregnant. I couldn't be around my friend-- but we texted often. I made her baby the quilt, and I sent it away to her. 

&#x200B;

Maybe crafting isn't your thing-- you could write her a letter or buy her something from Etsy that you know she'd love. You could just have flowers delivered or get her a ""photography mini session"" so that she can have some professional pics for her FB annoucement.

Thank you for sharing all your stories.

I had a D&C this morning, it was my first time under anaesthesia. My first miscarriage I opted for cytotec/misoprostol, which is fine if you don't know what's coming and can afford to be out for a few days. I couldn't and didn't want to do that this time, so I opted for the D&C. I'm glad I did. I was under general anaesthesia, but only for a very short time (maybe 10-15 minutes) and wasn't intubated, nor did I get a urinary catheter, only a catheter in my hand for IV fluids, pain medication and the anaesthetic.

I cried in the prep room and cried again right after I woke up, but overall it was 'good' (given the circumstances/better than the cytotec would have been).

Thank you for sharing all your stories.</p>

<p>I had a D&amp;C this morning, it was my first time under anaesthesia. My first miscarriage I opted for cytotec/misoprostol, which is fine if you don&#39;t know what&#39;s coming and can afford to be out for a few days. I couldn&#39;t and didn&#39;t want to do that this time, so I opted for the D&amp;C. I&#39;m glad I did. I was under general anaesthesia, but only for a very short time (maybe 10-15 minutes) and wasn&#39;t intubated, nor did I get a urinary catheter, only a catheter in my hand for IV fluids, pain medication and the anaesthetic.</p>

<p>I cried in the prep room and cried again right after I woke up, but overall it was &#39;good&#39; (given the circumstances/better than the cytotec would have been). I have had no pain except for a little cramping that&#39;s comparable to menstruation pains, and I&#39;m only bleeding a little bit. I wasn&#39;t nauseous or dizzy or anything.</p>

My story is not a lot like yours, but there are similarities in that our doctors also gave us a lot of false hope. At my first  ultrasound, I found out I was having twins. I asked if they were  identical or fraternal, and the doctor said they were ""probably  fraternal."" I asked if I needed to do anything special for a twin  pregnancy and she said, ""Buy two car seats instead of one!"" I accepted  that and started to get excited about twins. A different doctor did our  anatomy scan. The first thing he said was, ""Did you know you're having  twins?"" I said yes, and he told me it hadn't been recorded in my  paperwork, and that I should have been having ultrasounds much more  often because twins are automatically high risk. Then he said,  ""Especially identical twins sharing a placenta, like yours. This is an  extremely high-risk pregnancy."" I was shocked, because I had thought  they were fraternal. Then he told me that they were already showing  signs of fluid imbalance, which is a symptom of Twin-to-Twin Transfusion  Syndrome, which is 98% fatal to both twins if not treated quickly.

My story is not a lot like yours, but there are similarities in that our doctors also gave us a lot of false hope. At my first  ultrasound, I found out I was having twins. I asked if they were  identical or fraternal, and the doctor said they were &quot;probably  fraternal.&quot; I asked if I needed to do anything special for a twin  pregnancy and she said, &quot;Buy two car seats instead of one!&quot; I accepted  that and started to get excited about twins. A different doctor did our  anatomy scan. The first thing he said was, &quot;Did you know you&#39;re having  twins?&quot; I said yes, and he told me it hadn&#39;t been recorded in my  paperwork, and that I should have been having ultrasounds much more  often because twins are automatically high risk. Then he said,  &quot;Especially identical twins sharing a placenta, like yours. This is an  extremely high-risk pregnancy.&quot; I was shocked, because I had thought  they were fraternal. Then he told me that they were already showing  signs of fluid imbalance, which is a symptom of Twin-to-Twin Transfusion  Syndrome, which is 98% fatal to both twins if not treated quickly. He told me to come in again in two weeks for a followup ultrasound, and we&#39;d talk about surgery to save them. At the followup ultrasound, however, neither twin had a heartbeat, and I was induced the next day.  Every day since then I&#39;ve thought about that first doctor and how  careless she was.

The next two weeks of betas all rising but ""not enough"" when finally one day it shot up. We went in super early at 6w1d to confirm it wasn't ectopic , again full terror, and saw one little gummy bear and a heart beat flicker to top it all off. 

The past 5yrs, then loss, then past year, then past 2mo have been completely overwhelming and all consuming as you all here understand.  We are blown away to be here but at the same time are even more terrified than ever. 

Every moment, check, twinge, breath is nerve-racking. I have never felt so lucky, excited and thankful while simultaneously feeling terror and constantly waiting for ""what's going to happen next"". 

I don't think we will ever get past the fear, but I really really am hoping for the best.

I’m happy you found this sub there is lots of support. 

I delivered my sleeping baby at 21 weeks a little over a month ago. 

I spent most of my pregnancy waiting and feeling sad and scared. When we got the terminal diagnosis and learned that termination wasn’t an option because of where we live, I decided I wanted to enjoy the time we had left as much as possible. It was the hardest, saddest, and most beautiful time. Everything we did in the evenings was about her. We bought a blanket to hold her in at the hospital (we had not purchased anything for her as we were expecting this the whole time), we read to her every night, and my husband was lucky enough to get a good bye kick before she passed. 

Something that took time for me to understand is that in that time my husband was worried about me and what I was going to endure physically. He was scared of something happening to me too. He seemed less worried about the loss of our child. I was heartbroken about our baby. Now that he knows I’m going to be okay, he is grieving Charlotte more. There are differences in how mom and dad process what is happening. Honor where each of you are. There is no wrong way to feel. 

I was induced and delivered vaginally. If you have questions about that I’m happy to answer. 

As for the future, this doesn’t mean you can’t have more babies. We asked for more testing to be done to determine the cause for Charlotte’s issues. In our case, it turned out to be a fluke. Find out what the options are for testing once you have a diagnosis. They may test you and your partner depending on what they find. The more information you have will help with planning in the future. As for trying again I am tired of waiting but know it will be an anxiety filled time. My doctor said to wait 3 months after delivery.

If you want to talk any time I’m here. Sending hugs and support. I’m happy your mom is able to join you. I felt so happy with the visitors we had at the hospital. It felt like people really cared that we had a baby and it was not a private loss. My parents got to hold Charlotte and I am  so happy that was an option for us. I live in the US as does my mom, but my dad is in the UK.

The more information you have will help with planning in the future. As for trying again I am tired of waiting but know it will be an anxiety filled time. My doctor said to wait 3 months after delivery.</p>

<p>If you want to talk any time I’m here. Sending hugs and support. I’m happy your mom is able to join you. I felt so happy with the visitors we had at the hospital. It felt like people really cared that we had a baby and it was not a private loss. My parents got to hold Charlotte and I am  so happy that was an option for us. I live in the US as does my mom, but my dad is in the UK. </p>

<p>Hugs 💕</p>

Yes, TFMR is its own special kind of hell, but that doesn’t make your loss any less sad. I know if I have losses in the future, regardless of the circumstances, I’ll still be devastated.

Part of the reason I’m so optimistic is that I had a lot of time to prepare myself and process my feelings before the actual loss. I remember when we first got the NIPT results that I was crushed and angry that this would happen to me. I resented my body for not doing the merciful thing for me and ending the pregnancy on its own. I had to go through three amnios to get definitive results; the first two failed. I came to realization that I would be carrying my baby for longer than I thought I would, and that my baby was made with love and still deserved to be loved and celebrated, even if I didn’t get to keep him.

I have come out of all this a better, stronger person, and I know my Luca has made me a better mom to his siblings because he has changed so much about me. Some of it is negative (like being more anxious about TTC and future pregnancies), but overwhelmingly it’s for the positive - I am even more compassionate, empathetic, and caring than I was before. I also decided to go back to school to be an OB nurse once my husband finishes school.

I also had great support from my husband and my therapist and some close friends of mine. Plus I found these communities early on, and my bumper group was also super supportive while I was going through the process.

I hope you can get to a better place soon. Reach out to me anytime you need to. Feel free to look through my post and comment history if you want to know more about my story.

He told me to take all the time off I need. And he was serious about it. Super caring. I think my other coworkers probably saw me crying but I have no idea what they thought about it. I went home.

Today I managed to go in but super early so I wouldn't have to see anyone. I guess I breakdown around people pretty easily. I think my coworkers think I'm a bitch because I ignore them a lot and am always in a bad mood, but its been a really bad year. I lost my mother suddenly as well as my grandmother not long after and now this. Only my boss knows about all that.

Something I wish I knew before the D&C was that whatever they used to sanitize things down there can irritate the HELL out of your urethra.

I don't know if I've ever shared this, but when we received the news of the Trisomy 18 diagnosis, we knew we'd have to say goodbye. I was at that appointment alone, and the genetic counselor asked if we wanted to know the sex. I had her write it down on a little card because I didn't want to find out without my husband present. I first told him of the diagnosis, and then asked if he wanted to know. He didn't. I absolutely did and told him I didn't think I could stand it if we never found out. When we decided we'd be planting a tree in memory, we came up with a way to find out that made it a little more special than just reading it off of a horrible genetic report. We decided between two trees - a red maple or a yellow ginkgo. If it was a boy, it would be the maple, and if it was a girl, the ginkgo. We opened up the card together, and read it and cried - a baby girl. It was awful because it made everything so much more real, but it also put a bit of bittersweet happiness back into this memory.  

I can't wait to go outside and sit underneath this tree on warm sunny days, and watch this tree grow up as I would have watched my daughter. I know that for any future children we have, we'll take pictures with this tree so that we can have all our babies together in one spot. We'd always loved the beauty of the ginkgo, and we looked up the meaning behind it after we'd decided and found this: ""The Ginkgo tree is a phenomenon, an object of veneration, a sacred tree of the East, a symbol of unity of opposites, by some seen as a symbol of changelessness, possessing miraculous power, bearer of hope and of the immeasurable past, a symbol of love.

I absolutely did and told him I didn&#39;t think I could stand it if we never found out. When we decided we&#39;d be planting a tree in memory, we came up with a way to find out that made it a little more special than just reading it off of a horrible genetic report. We decided between two trees - a red maple or a yellow ginkgo. If it was a boy, it would be the maple, and if it was a girl, the ginkgo. We opened up the card together, and read it and cried - a baby girl. It was awful because it made everything so much more real, but it also put a bit of bittersweet happiness back into this memory.  </p>

<p>I can&#39;t wait to go outside and sit underneath this tree on warm sunny days, and watch this tree grow up as I would have watched my daughter. I know that for any future children we have, we&#39;ll take pictures with this tree so that we can have all our babies together in one spot. We&#39;d always loved the beauty of the ginkgo, and we looked up the meaning behind it after we&#39;d decided and found this: &quot;The Ginkgo tree is a phenomenon, an object of veneration, a sacred tree of the East, a symbol of unity of opposites, by some seen as a symbol of changelessness, possessing miraculous power, bearer of hope and of the immeasurable past, a symbol of love. Because of all its properties, it is associated with longevity.&quot; A perfect tribute to our baby girl.   </p>

The worst! If you need to be choosy about which tests to get, here are the ones I'd prioritize:

&#x200B;

1) **For hypercoagulability:** **CBC** and **PTT/PT-INR** (at minimum!), with the following additional testing if it's covered or if you have any personal or family history of blood clots: Antiphospholipid Syndrome testing (includes beta-1 glycoprotein, lupus anticoagulant, and anticardiolipin), Factor V Leiden, Prothrombin G20210A.  

2) **For reproductive hormones:** **CD3 testing** (LH, FSH, AMH, progesterone, testosterone, prolactin...I might be missing a few here)

3) **For thyroid disease: TSH with reflex to free T4 and anti-TPO antibodies**

4) **For autoimmune disease:** Ask for an **ANA** if you have a personal or family history of autoimmune disease (thyroid disease, Rheumatoid Arthritis, Lupus, Type 1 Diabetes) and/or if you have a personal history of blood in your urine, joint pain/swelling (usually in multiple joints), or rashes (often on the face). ANA isn't specific for any particular disease, but it's a pretty sensitive test, which makes it good for ruling things out--so, if you have a negative ANA, you most likely don't have something autoimmune going on. But if you have a positive ANA, they'll have to follow it up with other blood work to get a better idea of what's going on (and to determine if it's a weird false positive).

&#x200B;

And ideally, your husband would get a semen analysis.

&#x200B;

The other tests I mentioned (hycosy/HSG, transvaginal ultrasound, genetic testing, etc) can probably be put off until you see an RE. They're more relevant for when/if you're going down the road of fertility interventions \*or\* if you're having trouble getting pregnant. But since you've gotten pregnant twice in the last year, I'd be less concerned about something like primary ovarian insufficiency or some sort of structural abnormality in your uterus/tubes (e.g., endometriosis blocking off one of your tubes and preventing you from ovulating properly from that side). If I were your doctor, I'd prioritize seeing if there's a medical reason for recurrent pregnancy loss (although, it's most likely just bad luck--as frustrating as that sounds).

<p>1) <strong>For hypercoagulability:</strong> <strong>CBC</strong> and <strong>PTT/PT-INR</strong> (at minimum!), with the following additional testing if it&#39;s covered or if you have any personal or family history of blood clots: Antiphospholipid Syndrome testing (includes beta-1 glycoprotein, lupus anticoagulant, and anticardiolipin), Factor V Leiden, Prothrombin G20210A.  </p>

<p>2) <strong>For reproductive hormones:</strong> <strong>CD3 testing</strong> (LH, FSH, AMH, progesterone, testosterone, prolactin...I might be missing a few here)</p>

<p>3) <strong>For thyroid disease: TSH with reflex to free T4 and anti-TPO antibodies</strong></p>

<p>4) <strong>For autoimmune disease:</strong> Ask for an <strong>ANA</strong> if you have a personal or family history of autoimmune disease (thyroid disease, Rheumatoid Arthritis, Lupus, Type 1 Diabetes) and/or if you have a personal history of blood in your urine, joint pain/swelling (usually in multiple joints), or rashes (often on the face). ANA isn&#39;t specific for any particular disease, but it&#39;s a pretty sensitive test, which makes it good for ruling things out--so, if you have a negative ANA, you most likely don&#39;t have something autoimmune going on. But if you have a positive ANA, they&#39;ll have to follow it up with other blood work to get a better idea of what&#39;s going on (and to determine if it&#39;s a weird false positive).</p>

<p>&#x200B;</p>

<p>And ideally, your husband would get a semen analysis.</p>

<p>&#x200B;</p>

<p>The other tests I mentioned (hycosy/HSG, transvaginal ultrasound, genetic testing, etc) can probably be put off until you see an RE. They&#39;re more relevant for when/if you&#39;re going down the road of fertility interventions *or* if you&#39;re having trouble getting pregnant. But since you&#39;ve gotten pregnant twice in the last year, I&#39;d be less concerned about something like primary ovarian insufficiency or some sort of structural abnormality in your uterus/tubes (e.g., endometriosis blocking off one of your tubes and preventing you from ovulating properly from that side). If I were your doctor, I&#39;d prioritize seeing if there&#39;s a medical reason for recurrent pregnancy loss (although, it&#39;s most likely just bad luck--as frustrating as that sounds).</p>

<p>&#x200B;</p>

<p>Good luck!</p>

<p>&#x200B;</p>

Many times, doctors start with the most common/simplest testing and then move forward, in batches. Unfortunately, OBs are NOT in the practice of ""getting"" people pregnant. They are there for general GYN care and for care during a pregnancy. Their specialty is not usually why you can't conceive/can't stay pregnant. 

An OB can definitely do a first round of testing. And even more -- they have the authority to order them. But they don't always have the knowledge to interpret the results. Usually a Reproductive Endocrinologist is the best bet for that (just an FYI).

For a beginning round:

* CD3 testing
* Near surge testing, to compare to CD3 results...usually best to include an ultrasound, also
* Thyroid testing...and ALL of them, not just TSH and T3 (so ask for T3, T3RU, T4, and TSH)
* CD21 testing on multiple cycles

Thyroid issues are one of the most common issues related to loss and a great place to start when looking into a reason.

Unfortunately, a large percentage of repeat loss never has a reason attached. Thankfully, for those who don't find a reason, there is also a huge percentage who go on to have live births (80%!). Of course, the pain, time, and continual loss is hard while you wait and continue to try for that.

I have not gone public about my miscarriages. I think whatever you feel is most healing/cathartic for you is what you should do. Personally, I am a very private person with very little social media presence due to my highly public-facing job and I ultimately felt that to go public would be to give a piece of my privacy away to people who may not even care very much about me as a person. I do regret some of the people I had to tell the first time around, because they knew about my pregnancy. For instance, someone brought it up to me today, a very very informal acquaintance, and it took the wind out of my sails. I feel like people like that look at me now and all they see is my (very private, very complicated) pain, and it leaves me feeling regret, yes. But it’s not their fault—I reveal so little about my personal life, that this is the personal detail they latch onto, because it’s all they get. 

However—with all that said, if I am explicitly asked about my miscarriages or if I have children or any other thing surrounding the circumstances, I am honest, if the situation permits, and if I feel like it’s something I need to share for my own mental health/accommodations. For instance, I have skipped two baby showers, one for the daughter-in-law of a years-long family friend, so I sent a gift and had my mom pass along why I wouldn’t be attending. The other was for a coworker, and I just sent a gift and said I hated to miss but would be out of town (true).

Overall my experience was much better than I was expecting! I only had minimal post-operation pain, and was able to go back to work the following day.

For the surgery, I was put under (IV sedation, not general anesthesia). Start to finish (prep to leaving the hospital) it was probably 3-4 hours. The procedure itself was less than 30 minutes. I had minor bleeding in the hospital, followed by minor spotting for about a week.

I only had minimal pain (light cramps) post-op, which was easily handled by a dose of ibuprofen at the hospital, later that night, and the following morning.

(With the 200+ journal articles organized in a bibliography on PubMed.)  Not reader likes that degree of nuance and caveats, but I found it interesting.  Other people like &quot;Taking charge of your fertility&quot;, but I haven&#39;t read it.  </p>

<p>Also: Don&#39;t forget hubby.  Things from diet to cell phones in pockets to style of undies can make his side of the equation healthier, too.  </p>

It's a very personal decision, but for me after suffering in silence for the first three and having to individually explain when people would prod me about why I wouldn't attend their baby showers I just stopped being quiet about it.

I received a few private messages of support from some friends and family that I didn't even know had been through miscarriages of their own, and it made me feel at least some small amount of peace that for once people actually knew about the baby. 

Going forward I've decided to be open about it all. No more waiting for an arbitrary date to tell people when I get pregnant. I feel that my babies deserve to be known, if only briefly. 

I do think in the end it helped me cope somewhat. And I'm not ashamed to post random things about miscarriage. I was always hesitant before but being open about this last one seems to have let me express my grief more and I think that helps.

So my advice is if you feel comfortable with it, do it. But also remember that every year Facebook is going to remind you.

&#x200B;

1. HSG or Hycosy (imaging your uterus and tubes)
2. Basic blood work (""Day 3 labs,"" where certain hormone levels are measured at the beginning of your cycle--LH, FSH, etc). This should also include things like AMH, which can give a sense of your ovarian reserve and whether or not you might have primary ovarian insufficiency.
3. Semen analysis for your husband.
4. Basic genetics testing for you (e.g., I was tested for Cystic Fibrosis and Tay Sachs because I'm caucasian and of French-Canadian descent). This wouldn't have contributed to your losses, but it would be relevant re: possible future fertility interventions.
5. Transvaginal ultrasound with mid-cycle follicle count. This will also give a sense of your ovarian reserve.

&#x200B;

If I'm remembering correctly, that's what we had as part of our workup (my husband and I were both also 30-years-old at that time). I'm sure many others here are more familiar with reproductive endocrinology and/or have had their workups more recently than we did, so I'm sure they'll add more and/or correct me! (Thank you in advance, all!)

&#x200B;

Since you've had two losses, I don't think it would be unreasonable to ask for a basic coagulation workup. This would be a CBC (complete blood count--white blood cells, red blood cells, etc) and coags (PTT/PT-INR, which will give a sense of whether your blood clots appropriately). If there's any suggestion that your blood work is off, you could follow this up with further hematology workup that would assess for certain genetic conditions that might make you more prone to blood clots (e.g., Factor V Leiden, Prothrombin G20210A, and Antiphospholipid Syndrome).

&#x200B;

Good luck, and I hope this helps!

&#x200B;

Edited to add: I noticed that many women here get tested for an MTHFR mutation as part of their coagulation workup. This used to be associated with an increased risk of clotting, but that has since been debunked. For some reason, OBs still seem to treat this as a reason to anticoagulate. Anyway, this is actually a very common mutation, so if it comes up for you, I encourage you to follow up with a hematologist to get his/her take on it!

My daughter had TS and HLHS too. Plus a bunch of other problems that are caused by TS. 

We opted for genetic testing (quad screen) that’s how we found out at 16 weeks that there was something wrong. Unfortunately nothing could have been done. 

I know the pain is unbearable right now. And you’ve probably clung to every survivor story on YouTube. I know I’m still in TS and HLHS support groups on Facebook. I’ve joined them trying to prepare for a special needs child. We lost her in January 2017. And I still haven’t left those groups. I’m not ready to. Thankfully everyone is very understanding. 

My bleeding was all messed up for a while. But it’s probably because I’ve had the doctors put in the nexplanon before I ever even left the hospital. I bled and spotted and bled and spotted for 6 months until I had them remove the nexplanon. I hated it. It reminded me constantly about the loss. 
You didn’t mention if you’re on any BC right now. But a hormonal BC could mess with your body. 

I’m here if you want to talk. 
I’d hug you but that’s not possible. So just know that I’m thinking of you. 

Tomorrow is National Pregnancy and Infant Loss Awareness day. With your permission I’d like to light a candle for you baby girl too. (I also have a blog post prepped to honor the memory of our losses and posted a few days ago. If you’d like I can add her name too. It is up to you)

I'm confused. I had a mmc (10 wks), found out on 9/11, had the D&C on 9/14.

I had a nice recovery for 4 days and then had lots of bleeding (when I had none the prior 4 days) that lasted for 3 days and the OB diagnosed and treated me for a uterine lining infection. She also said she thought my period had started!

I was dubious but shes the doctor, so... anyways, I wasn't cleared for sex until the end of September, my husband and I did so on 9/30. It was still tender so we held off until earlier this week after that.

Long story short...I took a pregnancy test last weekend and it was negative (checking and hoping for the negative so I can start my Provera again) but I started feeling really sick and bloated on Thursday (10/11).

I figured it was my period coming.

Yesterday my husband said, ""maybe you're pregnant"" my immediate response was annoyance and I was kind of hurt because I thought he was joking but he apparently wasn't and said I should test.

I took an early response test this morning. Faint line. Ahhh. I'm so confused.

The test I took last weekend was a regular dip stick one so not as sensitive.

Could the early response this morning just be more sensitive and it's picking up the last of the mmc hormones or did I accidentally get pregnant?!?!?!

Anyone experience something similar and feel like sharing their outcome?

I feel like I’m very, very aware now of how much babies/kids/birth/loss are everywhere.</p>

Hi there. First, I am so sorry for your loss. My first loss was also an unplanned pregnancy, but I wanted that child so much and losing him/her spurred me into the TTC journey as well.

My most recent loss was ectopic. I lost my left tube along with it, and it nearly broke me. I wanted to give you some hope though.

&#x200B;

Part of the problem is with the standard medical notation itself--it doesn't indicate anything about the nature of someone's loss. In OBGYN, every woman is given ""G's and P's,"" which quickly tells the provider how many times the patient has been pregnant (""G"" for ""gravidity""), how many of those pregnancies were carried to viable age (""P"" for ""parity""--this includes live births and stillbirths), how many pregnancies were lost for any reason (""A"" for ""abortus""--which, since the word abort!on is most commonly used to refer to elective term!nations rather than MCs and TFMRs, I believe is often misinterpreted to mean only the elective kind), and how many living children the woman has (""L"" for ""Living""). Sometimes, this notation will indicate number of term births vs number of preterm births. But it doesn't ever indicate the reason for why a pregnancy ended prior to viability. So, for me, my medical note would read something like: ""aeb is a 31-year-old G2P0A1L0 who presents for blah blah blah."" Completely obscures the fact that my partner and I had to make the excruciating decision to end our very wanted pregnancy in order to spare our daughter from inevitable suffering.

&#x200B;

As a medical student on my OB rotation prior to my own loss, I never really knew what to do with that glaring ""A"" in someone's chart. Was that an elective abort!on or a miscarriage? Do they want to talk about it? Do they not want to talk about it? Should I even mention it? I'm sure I bungled more than one patient interaction.

&#x200B;

Anyway, none of this excuses how some of the office staff have treated all of you. Even with my loss in mind, the people at the front desk at my MFM office were occasionally \*very\* inappropriate when talking to me. For example, calling me to reschedule my D&E *the night before* because the karyotype wasn't back, yet, and using a tone of voice more appropriate for rescheduling a fucking hair cut (chirpy voice: ""We're going to have to move your procedure until after the weekend, mmmkay?"").

So I think he handled it well. It took me 3 OB's to find him when I was pregnant with my first. I cannot imagine going through with a TFMR with the other docs. Here's what he did that made things better for me. 

For context, we got a Trisomy 18 diagnosis at 11 weeks via Panorama blood test. Confirmed with CVS. Anasarca around the belly visible via ultrasound and a NT measurement of 4.8 (instead of 1.2)

He sympathized with me. He told me what HE would do, given the diagnosis. He urged me to go through with the CVS to make 1000% certain before terminating. He recommended a MFM that he knew and trusted. 

I researched myself and found that ultrasound is the most foolproof way to diagnose this condition with 93% accuracy before 14 weeks and 99.9% accuracy 14 weeks and beyond. This gave me a LOT of reassurance. 

After seeing the MFM and confirming the diagnosis via ultrasound, I went straight to his office - without an appointment - to talk to him about what to do. He didn't make me feel like I was intruding on his practice. Instead, he spent 30 minutes with me discussing my termination options. 

He told me the risks of carrying this baby until it passed - that later term D+C's are riskier the farther you are along. He told me what the scenarios were if I were to miscarry or if something happened along the way. 

When I left, he told me that he wasn't on call that weekend but if I needed him, just tell whoever was on call that I'm a ""star patient"" and that I needed him - that he would stop whatever he was doing and talk to me. 

Honestly, he really is the absolute BEST doctor I have ever had. He is caring, compassionate, and his style suits my needs to know every detail so we can make the best determination of my care together. 

When I was pregnant with my first, I had an emergency c-section. I was heavily hoping for natural birth, but he came in and told me several reasons why I needed the c-section and then he put everything in place to make it happen. He didn't just come in telling me what to do, he explained why it's my best option given the factors. That is invaluable and not something most docs do, from my experience. 

I guess the moral is... building a relationship with your patient so they know they can come to you and feel comfortable about making those life decisions with you. That leads to trust - and trust leads to great doctor/patient care. 

I appreciate your willingness to be an advocate for those who have had to make the absolutely heart-wrenching, grueling decision to TFMR. ",[],,t1_e7ns8s4,False,0,[],False,"<div class=""md""><p>I have an AMAZING doctor who values telling me all the information, plus some. So I think he handled it well. It took me 3 OB&#39;s to find him when I was pregnant with my first. I cannot imagine going through with a TFMR with the other docs. Here&#39;s what he did that made things better for me. </p>

<p>For context, we got a Trisomy 18 diagnosis at 11 weeks via Panorama blood test. Confirmed with CVS. Anasarca around the belly visible via ultrasound and a NT measurement of 4.8 (instead of 1.2)</p>

<p>He sympathized with me. He told me what HE would do, given the diagnosis. He urged me to go through with the CVS to make 1000% certain before terminating. He recommended a MFM that he knew and trusted. </p>

<p>I researched myself and found that ultrasound is the most foolproof way to diagnose this condition with 93% accuracy before 14 weeks and 99.9% accuracy 14 weeks and beyond. This gave me a LOT of reassurance. </p>

<p>After seeing the MFM and confirming the diagnosis via ultrasound, I went straight to his office - without an appointment - to talk to him about what to do. He didn&#39;t make me feel like I was intruding on his practice. Instead, he spent 30 minutes with me discussing my termination options. </p>

<p>He told me the risks of carrying this baby until it passed - that later term D+C&#39;s are riskier the farther you are along. He told me what the scenarios were if I were to miscarry or if something happened along the way. </p>

<p>When I left, he told me that he wasn&#39;t on call that weekend but if I needed him, just tell whoever was on call that I&#39;m a &quot;star patient&quot; and that I needed him - that he would stop whatever he was doing and talk to me. </p>

<p>Honestly, he really is the absolute BEST doctor I have ever had. He is caring, compassionate, and his style suits my needs to know every detail so we can make the best determination of my care together. </p>

<p>When I was pregnant with my first, I had an emergency c-section. I was heavily hoping for natural birth, but he came in and told me several reasons why I needed the c-section and then he put everything in place to make it happen. He didn&#39;t just come in telling me what to do, he explained why it&#39;s my best option given the factors. That is invaluable and not something most docs do, from my experience. </p>

<p>I guess the moral is... building a relationship with your patient so they know they can come to you and feel comfortable about making those life decisions with you. That leads to trust - and trust leads to great doctor/patient care. </p>

\#1 We started TTCing cycle 3, but I didn't get a BFP until I was 6 months out from my loss.

There are others who were on medication for anxiety/depression before their pregnancy, and (in addition to proper meds) might need more support from their OBs in coping.

Some women's loss history will warrant extra testing/scans by default; others will be treated like it's just a normal pregnancy.  Even for the latter, some women's OB's are open to an extra ""reassurance"" scan early on.  Other women opt for a private scan if they're really anxious.  I didn't get a doppler, but many find it reassuring.  While not absolutely ""necessary"", an extra scan or a doppler isn't particularly unreasonable.  

One alum had CVS, even though nothing about the pregnancy or her previous one's indicated it.  She just wanted that 100% reassurance, despite the MC risk.  I probably wouldn't have opted for that (I wish we didn't *have* to do diagnostic testing), but her doctor supported it, and it was the right choice for her.  

And when we're in a stretch where anxiety is tough and we have to just wait til the next appointment, keeping distracted and busy with hobbies, trips, etc. helps.

I haven't experienced the disagreements that you are having with your husband, so hopefully my thoughts and perspective are still helpful.

However, I did have a moment in time about two months after our loss that I basically freaked out about getting pregnant sooner. Long story short, we have to wait 6+ months before we can start trying again, but after a ton of research, I was convinced that we should just try right now. I was making plans about how to approach our doctor, basically just doing it against their wishes, etc.

&#x200B;

It was really hard for my husband because I was feeling so strongly about it and I felt he wasn't coming along for the ride. I felt like we were not on the same team, because if we were then he would agree to my schemes and we would get pregnant earlier.

He said some things that I didn't like AT ALL, such as ""Well, maybe now I can learn this instrument for a few months"" and ""I'd really like to get XYZ under control"" but what I heard was ""Well maybe I don't want a baby right now"" - which made no sense because we both agree'd that this experience only made us more certain of our want.

What he was really thinking was about my health, but he knew he couldn't out-right deny me in that moment. I was feeling so strongly that we must do this, that I would never feel happy again until we were pregnant. He kept pushing me to make an appointment with our doctor, which I finally did, to discuss trying sooner.

By the time the doctors appointment rolled around, I had calmed down a little bit. A month had gone by before our appointment and it had given me time to realize that time will still pass by. Even when I'm not pregnant, time will pass and I will be okay. I still wasn't happy but I was okay.

Of course, the doctor said no but also provided us with a ton of research and recommendations which backed up their reasoning. I felt better and my husband did too. Of course he wants a baby, but we had specific reasons for waiting.

&#x200B;

What I'm thinking about in your case is what the reasoning was for the 5 year wait? You made that decision for a reason and you may want to go back and reflect on that.

I also want to add that staying up to 2am to play games is part of his lifestyle, and parts of your lifestyle are, in my opinion, legitimate arguments when deciding whether or not to have a baby.

&#x200B;

Both of you probably feel like your happiness is in jeopardy, and that must be so difficult.

I'm sorry you are experiencing this, and I hope that the therapy does help you come to a solution that works for your family.",[],,t1_e7njvdw,False,0,[],False,"<div class=""md""><p>Hi Suhayma,</p>

I would think the question should be “what should medical professionals know about pregnancy loss” - abort!on due to one’s life choices at the time is one type of pregnancy loss, miscarriage is another, TFMR another, etc. and the experiences share similarities but are also quite different. 

Personally I had a missed miscarriage at 10 weeks after IVF. Not trying to compare battle wounds, loss is always hard, but I think loss after IVF is insanely difficult, after tens of thousands of dollars and possibly years of waiting, plus injecting yourself with crazy hormones, to get pregnant finally only to have your body “fail” on you again is devastating and you don’t believe you can go through it again— and a subsequent pregnancy is also incredibly nerve wracking because you’ve been dealing with previous loss on top of infertility. 

Some things I think is really helpful is that my RE provider (1) gave me some control over the process with info so I could make an informed decision (did I want to take a pill, pass naturally or do a D&C?) and gave me extra hand holding afterwards/acknowledged how hard this was and my pain. (2) my provider asked about my mental and emotional health and showed concern for me as a whole person. (3) my provider did everything she could to make sure we understood the reason for the loss (testing for chromosomal abnormalities). 

Another thing is it’s helpful to tell the patient that this is a PROCESS. I bled for weeks on end after my loss. It took over 2 months for my beta to go negative. I needed a hystroscopy several weeks after the loss to remove retained products. Pregnancy loss is not a one day event physically or emotionally.

I think that REs may be better at this process than OBs or GYNs because they deal with this level of fertility related devastation so much day in day out (I can’t imagine just going in for a scan at an OB at 10 weeks, being told there is no heartbeat, being told to just “wait it out to pass naturally” and “try again” in 3 months, and sent on my way, but I’ve heard of this being the case).",[],,t1_e7my08q,False,0,[],False,"<div class=""md""><p>The way this question is worded is confusing and a bit misguided.

I had an 8 week loss after trying to conceive for 10mo. I was beyond devastated and bawled my eyes out when the US didn't show a heartbeat--nothing like sobbing with a probe in your vagina! My doctor did a pretty good job being compassionate about my feelings but all in all I feel like she kind of had the attitude of ""you can try again soon!"". Maybe it's not reasonable to expect much more of her, but I wasn't ready to hear that yet. 

On the medical side--I took misoprostol when nature didn't take it's course. She told me to expect ""bleeding and cramping, like a period but a little heavier"". Holy shit, what an understatement. I did some googling (always a bad idea) and read horror stories, and also had a couple of coworkers who had taken it and had very bad experiences (emergency d&c sort of experiences), so I was absolutely terrified to take it. I asked for Norco, and she did give it to me but I felt a little like...why didn't she offer it to me? 

""Cramping"" isn't the right word for how it feels, but neither is ""contractions"" so I guess I don't know what she should have said. It hurt a lot and the bleeding isn't like a period at all--it's massive clumps that you have to push out. Sorry for all the details, but my point is that I felt like she really undersold the whole experience, and if I hadn't done my own research/talked to friends I would have been absolutely shocked. It feels like this breakdown could be very easily remedied by a pamphlet with more in-depth details and tips (my heating pad saved me), or even just a little lecture on it like we healthcare providers have memorized for so so so many things. I feel like it deserved a little ""spiel"" rather than her just saying what to do and saying to expect a heavy period. 

I hope I don't sound too hard on her, I really liked her and will continue to go to her. She did a great job overall and I really appreciated that she treated my like an equal. She spoke to me in healthcare language and when her APN read my ultrasound wrong and told me I still needed a d&c after I'd finished the Misoprostol (to which I also sobbed in the office), she called me at home to talk it over, explain it thoroughly since she knew I understood what was going on, and apologized.

And then I had a random day like 4 days in that was a little heavier again, which was different than my usual gradual taper. My second period was more normal but still not 100%. I think it was around my third period that I finally felt like I was re-normalizing. The way I think about it is that your uterine lining probably doesn&#39;t build up totally uniformly after a loss, so there&#39;s some uneven shedding.</p>

<p>&#x200B;</p>

<p>One thing I&#39;ll mention, though, is that my PMS symptoms totally changed after my loss. It used to be the case that I&#39;d get super sore boobs a few days before my period *every time.* After my loss, I never got sore boobs again. In fact, I barely got any PMS symptoms at all. By four months after my loss, I was concerned enough to ask my OB about it--I was worried it meant that my hormones were off or something (specifically, I was worried about low progesterone). She reassured me that the only thing that matters is that you&#39;re getting periods. And I got pregnant three months later.</p>

Hi there. My husband and I have similar opinions as you and your husband, though not quite to the extremes you describe. We have a 9 month old son after suffering 3 very difficult losses, the last of which nearly took my life along with it. We were so close to calling it quits when our rainbow came into our lives. Now that he’s older and that the “fertility odds” are stacked against us, I’ve started talking about trying to give him a sibling. My husband says no and that he’s happy with one. And if that’s our reality, then I am still 100% content. I just want to try before we commit to only one.

I asked him why he feels so strongly. During the miscarriages and time in between them he was so strong. Much stronger than I was. I still suffer from PTSD and anxiety from it all, and, as much as I’d like to deny it, my losses changed me. I have to work so much harder to relax and “let go” of things than I used to. My husband told me that he never wants to see me go through that again. He sat with me through every doctors appointment. He held my hand as I sat on the toilet feeling my pregnancies leave my body. He watched me lie there in a hospital bed recovering from emergency surgery to remove my ruptured Fallopian tube. And, even though there was joy in the end, he watched me struggle through mild PPD during our son’s first few months of life. It was really hard on him to watch it all and feel helpless. And I get it. For the first time in awhile, our sex life isn’t governed by OPKs and HPTs, or suspended altogether due to high risk pregnancies. He sees me starting to enjoy my hobbies and hang out with friends again. I actually talk about things that aren’t baby-related. He finally has his wife back. He’s worried (and I have to admit- he has good reason) that he will lose me again if we commit to TTC again.

You have to find your own balance. Personally, ours is a combo of avoiding the fertile window with a little bit of “throwing caution to the wind” here and there. We’ve made a goal to revisit our feelings every three months. Your husband’s reaction suggests that you might not be the only one suffering from PTSD from everything that has happened, so perhaps therapy or counseling may help if you wanted to go that route. It sucks that you both have very real and valid emotions about this, but hopefully you can reach a middle ground.",[],,t1_e7lwqet,False,0,[],False,"<div class=""md""><p>TW: LC</p>

It SUCKS and I’m sorry for your loss. </p>

This was my second tattoo, I got 2 matching when I was 19 (because I could lol). 

I spoke with the artist, told him I wanted something to represent three pregnancy losses.

I added a skull in because skulls are cool and, if the roses are pregnancies, then i want something there to represent they died, ended too soon. The artist took those ideas and came up with a design that works well on my body, and really captured the beauty/sadness of it all.

I think it looks hella cool. It's on my shoulder blade/back, it ended up being much bigger than I expected, but I think it looks really good. It's bright, it's very colourful, and it's very me. My husband likes the design (this was a consideration I hadn't had to worry about with tattoo #1!).

I found the process of getting it cathartic too. When you're getting tattooed, particularly over sensitive areas like the spine or ribs, all you can do is breath and live in the moment. It felt a lot like meditating, and it was focused on me surviving my losses. 

Doesn't mean I'm cured at this point. But I don't think anyone ever really gets over their losses. But it was more about having something permanent from my pregnancies. I didn't get a child or stretch marks or anything to physically remind me. For some reason I was worried I'd be an old lady with memory loss and have nothing to remind me of my almost motherhood.

And since this happened though no one has said anything in the chat. I wonder if they’ve started another chat without me where the friend who is pregnant can talk about her pregnancy more openly, which is totally fine for me! I’ve since realized that while it was the T-shirt’s image at first that upset me I think it’s more my jealousy of her pregnancy in general. And she just doesn’t know how sensitive I am. And you’re right, we do just have a different perspective now and I dont even know if I would have thought of this before.

My story is very similar to yours except for the IUI. I got pregnant end of April, found out something was potentially wrong (but heartbeat!) at 8 weeks, no heartbeat at 9 weeks, took the pills to avoid potential d&c scarring (first pregnancy). 

I grieved very openly and publicly for about 6 weeks because I just did not give a fuck about what other people thought about it. People were very supportive. I started to feel better and stopped talking about it as much. 

Now, of my two best friends, one just gave birth and the other one just announced they are expecting their second. I don’t want to be this way, but I am jealous and completely regressing. I am included in all of the pregnancy/baby conversations, which have become increasingly upsetting as we are trying (and failing) to conceive again.

Anxiety is normal after a loss like this--it can help a little just to know that.  

We got referred to a bereavement counselor and a parent support group for perinatal loss as first steps.  (Both the hospital where I delivered and my OB gave us referrals.)  Some people see a private therapist with experience in pregnancy loss.  

If the anxiety/depression is persistent and a problem for you, then medication might be worth considering.  I think a few women have even been prescribed something that was pregnancy-safe, so they could continue it for PAL anxiety if needed.  

But meds don't have to be the first step.  See if your doctor can connect you to some of the other support options I mentioned--(or seek them out on your own).  There's no such thing as too much support after a loss like this.

Unfortunately I don’t know too much about how obesity affects egg retrieval protocols and maybe she does have pcos with that. It’s so hard to find a donor if they are family and if not it does make it easier.

Any other issues?  This is all awful really awful and I’m so sorry for what you’re going through. I’m really weary of anything or anyone that says things are “bad luck” since a ton of people get pregnant and carry on their first try and never have miscarriages. There’s obviously reasons for all this, but we need competent docs and a lot of self advocating to refuse to believe this shit “bad luck” excuse over and over again. Overall, no one can tell us we will have a baby, even after we tried everything but we can try everything we can to get to the bottom of this. </p>

For me, I need something that keeps me accountable, or it's easy to stay home--signing up for a once/week volunteer activity, a rec class or exercise class, something completely unrelated to babies, families, etc. might help get you out a little, without the demands and commitment of work.  

With everything you've been through, and everything ahead, you deserve to have some activities that don't make you feel like life is 100% on hold or revolving around TTC.  You deserve something to look forward to, something brings you a little bit of enjoyment. When facing a prolonged challenge, it helps to have those sorts of things to sustain us.  

Sending a big hug!",[],,t1_e7i7i2m,False,0,[],False,"<div class=""md""><p>The main benefit of testing is that you&#39;re not left wondering, &quot;What if it was genetic?&quot;  But beyond that, it can be unsatisfying either way.  Maybe babies were healthy, but were still lost and doctors don&#39;t know why.  Or babies had a genetic issue, at which point doctors might try to reassure you by telling you how rare it is---and then it&#39;s like, &quot;Why <em>this</em> baby?  Why <em>my</em> babies?&quot;  The worst is that, either way, doctors can&#39;t say how to prevent it from happening again.  </p>

<p>My sister&#39;s daughter was born the day before my son&#39;s due date, so I understand how upsetting your friend&#39;s news must have been.  My niece&#39;s monthly milestones are regular reminders of what my son didn&#39;t get to do (and come on the monthly anniversary of his death).  It&#39;s understandable if you need space from that friend in particular for some time....</p>

I've been in and out around here for a bit, but am gearing up again. I've been WTT for several months mainly due to me starting my new job. Although I am enjoying the job overall, the workload is overwhelming right now and not going to let up for a few months yet. In the mean time, we had some fertility testing done a few months ago and it showed that I have very low AMH (0.21).

We finally had a follow up consultation with the RE today.  He is recommending IUI, and quickly.  He said with an AMH number that low, he would not be willing to do IVF.

I was prepared for IVF being off the table, but it was still hard to hear. The whole thing continues to be a lot to process. It was just about a year ago that we conceived our first baby- and then we started losing, losing, losing. At least we have an explanation- I know a lot of people don't ever get that. I'm trying to cling to what remains and keep some hope alive for the future.

I am not willing (because I don't feel that I'm able) to start treatments until I can get through this crazy transitional period at work. We are planning on starting TTC this month on our own and rolling the dice.  How do I do this again when the odds seem so overwhelming that I'll end up with another loss, no matter what we do?

I feel like some women's OBs are laissez-faire (even after one pPROM), while others are extra cautious.  My sense is that they really don't know if there's a risk of a problem until the pregnancy's in the 2nd tri, so I'm not sure a cervical check now would tell you much.  

> I may call MFM because I think they have a different NIPT that tests for more things.  

I've dug into this a *lot* because initially the cardiologist thought our son might have a microdeletion that the NIPT companies are starting to test for.  That's why we were sent for an amnio.  It turns out that his condition was something else--something that can only be tested for with amnio. (So we're stuck doing amnios to rule out recurrence.)  

But the upshot is that the NIPT tests for any conditions outside of T21, T18, T13, triploidy, and Turner's are all pretty useless.  Panorma, Counsyl, Harmony, etc. will all test for a subset of microdeletion syndromes now....and they *will* give you a number.  But they don't know how often their results are wrong or right.  They have zero stats on false positive and false negative rates (say nothing of PPV).  I've even written one of the companies, to see if they had information that wasn't on their website/published in a journal article.  And they confirmed that they don't have those error rates.  (They did give numbers for the performance of their trisomy screens, so it's not like they just didn't want to give out their performance stats.)

So you can get a number for risk, but what do you do with that number?  Is it correct or not?  It's like we're their guinea pigs.

For this reason, our hospital doesn't even give us the option of opting for these experimental screens.  The ""decline"" box is pre-checked on the NIPT forms.  

[TW: current pregnancy]  
The biggest risks for our subsequent pregnancies are early miscarriage > trisomies > recurrence of son's condition > something else rare.  Even though we have to do amnio, we still opted for NIPT, because  I didn't like the idea of going an extra 5-6 weeks not knowing.  

I know that for me, getting to move from WTT to TTC was a positive step for me in my emotional healing.  I could stop ruminating on some of the ""what-ifs"".  So I appreciate that side, just as I appreciate the ramifications for PAL.  

pPROM/IC moms, moms like myself who are still doing testing for recurrence of issues at 23 weeks, mom's who had 3rd tri losses, etc. definitely have a longer slog through PAL anxiety than the first tri MC mom's who get past their hurdle, start feeling more confident, start announcing ~13 weeks, like your ""average"" pregnant person in the ""safe"" zone.

I naturally veer towards caution.  After my loss, I was really investing in doing everything I could control to prevent another loss/buffer me from feeling like something was my fault in the event of another loss.

It’s rough. For some unknown, highly masochistic reasons, I decided to check up on an old friend who is due around beginning of next month.

I’m not exactly happy for her, but I am glad her pregnancy seems to have gone well. I’ve spent some time crying about how unfair life is, and I imagine I’ll do it all over again on Thursday. I have the day planned to stay at home and feel sorry for myself. 

Last month I had a preconception appointment with a MFM specialist. She echoed what my OB said — baby aspirin and extra folate because it’s probably not the cause of my miscarriages, but it certainly won’t hurt. She did some more blood clotting tests that all came back negative. Basically I’m healthy and it’s probably related more to my age. But she said that despite what I feel, that I’m not too old and have plenty of time to have a healthy baby. She was very optimistic, and it made me feel better. She gave me permission to start trying again right away even though my OB wanted me to wait a little longer. 

So now I’m in that TWW. I’m refusing to test early. If AF shows, she’ll be here on Friday. I wanted so badly to be pregnant again by my due date, but I don’t want a negative test on Thursday to send me into a spiral. It’ll be a hard enough day already, so I might as well wait and see what happens Friday before bothering with anything.

<p>In nice news, I took my first writing class last night and it was good. I have more fundamental background than anyone else in the class, but it&#39;s alright because the teacher kind of turned to me a few times to contribute to discussion in a instructional way.</p>

<p>Edit: Totally think I&#39;m on CD 1. Crampy and enough bleeding consistently that I need a pad, still super light. I&#39;m so so so happy (how weird is that?)</p>

My OB didn't prescribe a specific waiting period for emotional reasons.

My coworker who I am friendly with and who has been trying for several years for another child told me the last day I worked that she is newly pregnant.  I was happy for her, but then she started complaining about her pregnancy; the timing isn’t perfect.  She’ll have to then have another child, because it’ll be sad for the baby to not have a sibling close in age.  So I’m dreading I’m going to walk into more complaining today and we are headed towards a tough conversation.  I really can’t be the person she unloads all this on.  It’s so unlikely I’m going to be pregnant this year and all the babies that would have been close to my LC’s age are dead.  Hopefully I can politely convey this to her without offending her.

I was still crying a lot. I’ve since accepted my loss and that my baby is gone. It’s been six weeks since my loss and I feel fine most days. I still cry sometimes when I talk about my baby but it’s less frequent. I still get anxiety around pregnant women and people with young babies.</p>

<p>Will I ever be without pain? No, but the pain is much less intense. TTC will bring anxiety but I’m ready to move forward, I’m now just waiting on my body to catch up. I think grief is so individual, but when you’re ready, go for it. I wouldn’t let something I read sway me if my heart is telling me that I’m ready.</p>

<p>That said, there is research that says people who get pregnant relatively soon after loss have a shorter grief period. My psychiatrist said that in his experience, the sooner his patients get pregnant, the better they have felt. Everyone will have opinions, but the only ones that really matters are yours and your partner’s.</p>

I had a 27-week stillbirth, and two D&Cs in the two weeks that followed. I was very ill and the doctors thought it was a uterine infection making me so sick (septic shock); hence the rush to D&C. Turns out I had a perforated bowel obstruction that had caused the uterine infection that killed my daughter. 

Five months later, my period had returned and all seemed well, but my OB and MFM wanted me to go see a reproductive endocrinologist to assess whether there might be uterine scarring from the D&Cs. He did a hysteroscopic saline ultrasound and found additional retained placenta. He scheduled me for a ""hysteroscopic evacuation of retained products of conception"" several weeks later. During the procedure, he found an additional piece that he hadn't seen during the ultrasound. Afterwards, he put me on estrogen pills for a month and I had one very long cycle, but since then my cycle has been normal. After that first long cycle, he did another hysteroscopic ultrasound and gave me the all-clear to try. 

So it's certainly possible, and something to take seriously. Even after several months, retained placenta could trigger an infection. But before another D&C, I would push for the hysteroscopic ultrasound and, if needed, a hysteroscopic evacuation. They get such a better view, and the risk of scarring is much less.

I had retained placenta after a D&C for a missed miscarriage at 12 weeks. My case was unusual because I had no extra bleeding, but my period wasn't returning and my pregnancy tests were still positive at 7 weeks after the D&C. They first kept serial testing my hcg to see if it would resolve on its own, but while it decreased, it eventually plateaued. They finally did an ultrasound at 10 weeks after the D&C, and discovered I had some placenta that was still vascularized.

And this is where things took the turn for the worst. I had a second D&C under ultrasound guidance, but I think she was having trouble getting it out so she actually used curettage instead of just the usual vacuum aspiration. I ended up with uterine scarring due to the extra trauma to my uterus while it was still in a postpartum state, and have not been able to conceive since then despite going to a specialist to repair my uterus and despite now doing IVF. I have sole uterine factor infertility now. It has been 2.5 years since that second D&C.

Retained placenta is not an absolute emergency, so you don't need to do anything about it asap unless the bleeding becomes dangerously heavy again or you start to notice signs of infection (weird discharge, lots of pain, fever). You can wait and just be monitored to see if your body will handle it, you can try misoprostol (the pill people take to try to have a miscarriage at home when it's not proceeding on its own), or you can do a procedure called a hysteroscopy where they go through your cervix with a camera and that way they can see what they're doing to remove the retained placenta while damaging your uterus far less than a D&C might.

I do not recommend a D&C for retained placenta. Yes it can go okay and it did for some people here, but the rates of uterine scarring after a D&C for retained placenta are at least around 30%. If I'd know it was that high I would not have done it. I was told it was rare. (It is rare for elective D&C's or for missed miscarriages that only need one D&C).

Some ob/gyns do hysteroscopies, so you can ask yours if they do them. Other doctors who do them are ob/gyns with a subspecialty in minimally invasive surgery, and fertility ob/gyns who are called Reproductive Endocrinologists. Even if you choose waiting or misoprostol, I recommend starting to explore the hysteroscopy option because it often takes a while to schedule so you don't want to wait till the last minute only to need to wait several more weeks. 

Regardless of what option you take, if your period does not return within 6-8 weeks, or it returns and is much lighter than usual for more than one period, get an HSG, a saline ultrasound, or a diagnostic hysteroscopy to look at the inside of your uterus to make sure you have not developed any adhesions. If you have scarring,  you'll catch it much earlier than I did in which case it will be much easier to treat (it took them several months to diagnose me which made it worse) and should not impact your future fertility. I'm an unusually severe case.
