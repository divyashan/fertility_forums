we had more time to get a huge home renovation completed. We redid the master shower, just need to do the floors and paint in that bathroom, drywall and paint half bath, replacing over 1000 sqft of flooring on our main level and putting luxury vinyl tile in the eventual nursery.

I'm really tired today. It's rainy here and that's probably not helping matters. 

I'm visiting my midwife on Thursday to discuss anti-anxiety medication. She mentioned, at my postpartum visit, that she would likely prescribe something for a subsequent pregnancy, and I'm kind of at the point now where I see no reason to put it off until then. TTC means I open up a new box of anxiety every week except period week, when I know that we get to kind of just take a break and wait for the bleeding to subside and for the fertility watch to begin. I've noticed in the last two cycles that about 5 days before I ovulate I start getting really anxious-- I've already been waiting like two weeks, I'm approaching the fertile window, I start questioning every sign of fertility and wonder if my cervical mucus is trolling me. I don't sleep well which messes up my temps, I start getting anxious about sleeping better to get more reliable temperatures. It's a self-defeating cycle. And then once I start seeing EWCM I relax a little, because it's finally time for some action and I know that I do everything I can to catch the egg, and then for a day or two after I ovulate I relax again-- I am confident that I ovulated, I'm confident I gave it my best shot, and there's nothing to do but hope. And then the anxiety sets in AGAIN, and especially now with my cycles still so messed up after the stillbirth, and super short luteal phases, the two week wait is just a one week wait and so my anxiety starts escalating around 2 DPO and as much of a bummer as it is to see my period, and to see it so early that a pregnancy wasn't even possible, I at least feel relieved that the waiting was over and my anxiety can subside again for a while. So. Obviously things are not going well, and I think medication would be a really useful tool for me right now.

But because of my last office visit, where I freaked out because of my 5 day luteal phase, I'm a little anxious to go back. This time I'll be seeing my regular midwife-- the one who delivered Sam, who saw me at my 2 week and 6 week checkups, and is a generally kind and supportive person, so I'm hoping it's not like the last time, where I saw a different midwife and she questioned whether I was really in a good place to begin trying again. (WTF is a ""good place"" to begin trying again after a 39 week loss?) I do doubt that my midwife would ask that question in such a way, and even if she were to do so, I feel more prepared to defend myself now, and more assured that this truly is the right thing for me at this time. But I'm still just anxious that I'll have an altercation at all, like she'll say something like, ""if it's making you this anxious then maybe you should take a few months off."" I know I need to stop evaluating the ""worst case scenarios"" in my head, but I just want to be prepared to explain that the reason I am anxious is not because I am *trying* to become pregnant, it is because I am *not currently* pregnant, and my heart's deepest desire is a baby. A living one. There's absolutely no comfort to be found right now in being told, ""You just HAD a baby, give it time."" I got pregnant a whole YEAR ago. I've already given this problem adequate time, I am ready for a solution now. And I didn't get pregnant for pregnancy's sake. I got pregnant to bring home a child. Instead, I got a corpse and a sad grief baby to carry with me through life. Anytime someone suggests that what I need is more time, it's like they are implicitly saying that Sam's corpse and my grief baby should really be enough for me. It's not, and I hate that I've ever had to explain or justify that to anyone for even a moment.

Professional but with a down-to-earth and lighthearted demeanor.

Anyway, although my LMP/CP was 7/3, which would make me 6+1 today, based on my ovulation date I'm actually 6+3.  Per the OB, my EDD is 4/7/2018.  We got our first ultrasound today where it's confirmed that the egg implanted inside the uterus (so *not* ectopic--yay!) and we saw the yolk sac, but no embryo or heartbeat.  OB was not concerned since right now I'm just on the threshold on when we might be able to see a something.  He gave gave us 3 options: 1) Do a beta draw today and another one in 2 days to see if hCG is going up at a good rate; 2) come back in 2 weeks for another ultrasound; or 3) do both.  I oped to do both, so if the numbers aren't looking good, we'll know sooner rather than later and can make the appropriate plans.

In terms of the outlook, he says it could be 50/50 either way right now, but he's not too worried because at it's an intra-uterine pregnancy.  He also gave me instructions on what to do should I begin miscarrying between now and the ultrasound in 2 weeks, adding that a D&C would likely not be necessary since it's so early, but he would do another scan after I'm done bleeding to make sure everything passed out.  Since I've already had 4 CPs, if I have a 5th he will refer me to a specialist.

While today's results were not as optimistic as I had hoped (with at least a heartbeat, fetal pole, or whatever else one could reasonably expect to see at 6 weeks), I'm glad that at least there wasn't anything that immediately pointed to imminent complications.

Yes, because I know now that not ever seeing Raff would have been worse. A much more unicorn life, but one in which my son never existed. But our children were *meant* to live. That's why we planned for them and decorated their nurseries and bought diapers. We didn't have God whispering in our ears, ""Hey, you're meant to have a stillbirth, so don't buy so much."" It was meant to be, yet it didn't happen.

A comment that I kept close was, ""Accepting a sad thing means accepting that things go wrong. The birth was meant to be, the death was not, but that's still what happened. We all experience suffering somehow, but my loss was not the correct outcome. *Be brave enough to acknowledge that sometimes the wrong things happen in life.* "" u/Orchidsandtears said that in a comment awhile back. I try to look for opportunities to tell this to people because I'm sick of being thought of as this special person that something bad happened to only because I was strong enough or something.

Just because they're comforting to people who didn't go through it, doesn't mean that platitudes are correct. People die. Our babies died too soon.

I realized it yesterday. Before I got married I made huge lifestyle changes and lost 60 pounds over the course of two years. I looked and felt amazing. But I did this with very healthy habits. I had healthy carbs, I had a consistent weight loss of 0.5-1 pound per week, I did lots of weights and a healthy amount of cardio, I was super super patient with myself! And I always lost inches before pounds, literally always. So I tried to do this now...but it really backfired. Badly.

One of my biggest pregnancy worries was that I'd be ""fat again,"" well I got super bitter yesterday that I have 20 pounds of pregnancy weight I still need to lose and I have NO BABY to show for it. And on top of that I put myself on an extremely low carb diet. Which, I really like doing, but I am way too hard on myself. 

I don't know why I wanted to beat myself up more. But I weighed myself in the evening. In the EVENING--after eating and drinking fluids all day and knowing that I'm losing inches before pounds!

And hating my life, and feeling like a failure, that I have no control over my body on top of my pregnancy outcomes. Yeah...it wasn't pretty. 

I'm feeling better today. I guess I just needed to let all of that out. My grief has been feeling suppressed so maybe this was a new outlet. Now I'm trying to really Self Love the shit out of myself. Really talking nicely to myself and being patient. Trying not to overly restrict my foods and calories so I don't keep overeating and crying. Lol. It feels funny to type but that's what's happening.

My almost two month old son passed in Feb due to negligence at the hospital. He had to go through an autopsy as well. :(

We've known that we wanted more kids after our first was born in 2015 and after we conceived again at 4 months PP. After our second son died so unexpectedly, I was terrified at the thought of having more kids. If we didn't already have our 14 month old (at the time), I would have sworn off having any more kids due to the fear and the cruelty of the world. Just like you, we want our kids close in age, especially because it was honestly easier and more fun having two rather than just one. So we decided to get pregnant again two months after our son passed. I'm currently almost to the halfway mark and will probably have my third December baby in a row. Our first and third will be exactly two years apart. The pregnancy was ultimately my decision. My husband has been so supportive of everything. It's our third pregnancy and baby in three years, since I've been getting pregnant at 4 months PP each time. This pregnancy has been quite bittersweet so far. I think it helps knowing that it's a girl this time, and I feel like it helps because the sex is not the same as my angel baby. 

We're in the US, and my old doctor and current one are both okay with me being pregnant again. For context, I'm in my mid-twenties and was healthy to begin with. I did ask for an extra ultrasound at 15 weeks just for my own peace of mind even though the my son's autopsy showed that there was nothing anatomically wrong with him. My current doctor is doing everything she can to help me feel okay, and I love her for it. I do feel like being pregnant again is helping me heal in a different way. 

Consider your support system around you. My husband is my rock, especially after all that we've been through with both of our kids (our first developed a feeding aversion at three months; he's better now, but those were a few tough months). We've moved to be closer to family. These days, our main priority is (for me, especially) to feel comfortable and to gain back my confidence. I feel like healing is always going to be a work in progress for me and that I have to continue to keep living life as best as I can for the sake of all of my children.

<p>We&#39;ve known that we wanted more kids after our first was born in 2015 and after we conceived again at 4 months PP.

As you said for yourself, I have always thought I had thyroid issues, but my TSH was always normal. We lost our first pregnancy at 12 weeks and I made my OB do all the RPL testing which includes Free Ts (way more important than TSH) and thyroid antibodies. My FT4 was low normal and I had thyroid antibodies. No clue if the pregnancy triggered them (very common) or if I had them before. I immediately started seeing an Endo who retested my levels and my antibodies had risen, TSH (still never above 2), FT3 and FT4, still in range but low. We started Synthroid and I had a horrible reaction. Then found out I was pregnant again and I was on top of it. I asked to switch the Westroid and that helped my side effects. I checked my levels every 4 weeks in pregnancy and increased each month. This was a big clue that my body desperately need thyroid hormones.  Around my 3d tri, I switched back to Synthroid because my FT3 wasn't increasing well on Westhroid and had no side effects. Retested 6 weeks PP and my levels went down.

Here is what I have learned:

* You need to have vitamin D and iron checked. Most thryoid patients have issues with both. I take an extra 7kIU of D a day, but only need iron when pregnant.
* There is a wonderful group on BabyCenter. They were invaluable to helping me learn about how to manage thryoid disease. I usually steer clear of BC, but they were so helpful. 
* My biggest symptom has always been fatigue and the meds never helped, though I've only had about 2 months of no breastfeeding or pregnancy on meds. 
* I take 200mg of Selenium a day to help reduce antibodies. Not sure if its working but Endo said it can't hurt. 
* The range for ""normal"" is just a range, most people feel good with their numbers either in the middle or high end of the range, hence my increasing each blood draw if my numbers aren't where I want them. 
* I didn't do well on desiccated thryoid (Westhroid and a few others), but so many people do. Definitely work checking out.

Like, where is all this blood COMING from? It had less than a week to build up! 

We are slowly starting to dismantle the nursery. I'm kind of hiding one baby item at a time. We have more or less successfully day-trained our toddler, so I'm putting away all the cloth diapers in storage. Right before Sam was due, I had the elastics on all of them replaced because they were pretty worn out after 2.5 years of constant use, and now they all look brand new and ready for a new little baby, and I have no little baby to put them on. When we first built up this stash, I had no qualms about buying way too many, reasoning that at some point we would have two kids in diapers at a time and I'd be really glad we had way too many diapers. Now I just feel so stupid for how many diapers I bought and how confident I ever had the audacity to be about how easy things might be in the future. I feel like I'm staring into a babyless void for forever.

So we'll dismantle the nursery a few things at a time. We'll leave the big furniture in there for now, mostly because I don't really know where to put the crib and changing table, and I'm still holding out hope that we'll need them again soon anyways... but I think in a couple months if I'm still TTC I'll really start viewing them as a jinx. Honestly, that's the only way I think I'll be able to really take apart the nursery-- if I keep viewing these things as a jinx inhibiting another pregnancy, because taking down a nursery that I just completed four months ago is really soul-crushing when I think about it in that way. 

Also, I'm so frustrated by just how slowly time seems to pass these days. I know each day is still exactly 24 hours, and each hour is still exactly 60 minutes, and each minute is still exactly 60 seconds, so what I don't get is just how it is that each day is stretching into an eternity while I hope to get pregnant again.

I got pregnant with my almost-three-year-old that cycle-- it adjusted my thyroid level that quickly. During my pregnancy and my subsequent pregnancy, my thyroid levels were checked monthly and bi-monthly, respectively. They were always well controlled on my dose -- 25mcg, but had they fluctuated, my endocrinologist would have adjusted my dose accordingly.  (For what it's worth, my TSH levels were totally fine during my second pregnancy and afterward, and had nothing whatsoever to do with my stillbirth.)

I didn't notice any physical changes when my thyroid levels were controlled, with the sole exception that I stopped miscarrying. I did just learn, from my acupuncturist who specializes in fertility issues, that in her experience patients fare a lot better on Synthroid rather than a generic, and suggested I bring that up with my endo-- I have a routine follow up this week so I was planning on mentioning it. I'm kind of indifferent to that-- I've always responded so well to levothyroxine, and I don't particularly think that has anything to do with my current inability to conceive, which I acknowledge is likely due to physical healing that needs to take place. 

Also of note: I visited a new RE in my current state (we moved 2 years ago) to see if he would be able to follow my thyroid in a new pregnancy, when we were just considering starting for #2. He told me that ACOG released new guidance that subclinical hypothyroidism does not increase the frequency/rate of miscarriage and does not need to be treated. He said I could keep taking my low dose ""if I wanted to"" but his attitude toward it turned me off so much, because to this day I am convinced that I would have just miscarried in perpetuity if I hadn't had my thyroid levels adjusted. I know that's anecdotal and not scientific, but when YOU'RE the anecdote, you don't give a shit about scientific recommendations anyways. I found my current endo after that and she is more than happy to continue treating me in this manner and agrees that it's important for healthy pregnancies.

I'm another infant loss mom, and I'm in a similar timeline, but a couple moths farther out (our three week old died of an undetected respiratory defect in February).

I don't have any definitive advice, but I can tell you the path my husband and I took to being ready to try again. 

I also just want to commiserate on a couple of your points. One of the most frightening things for me (of all the scary stuff wrapped up in this) is that people I love, or people in general, are going to think that a new baby will somehow ""fix"" us, and we won't be grieving our daughter anymore. There are people in my life who still haven't acknowledged our daughter or her death, and I'm giving them a lot of room, because they are all new parents too (all of my cousins on one side had babies this year) but I won't be able to handle it if they congratulate us on a new pregnancy without really acknowledging our first daughter. If it never happened to us they don't have to worry that it could happen to them. 

I do the math all the time. For instance, if I were to get pregnant this cycle, I would be about 6-7 months on my daughter's first birthday. I am willing to and planning on keeping my pregnancy a secret until we've been able to celebrate our daughter's birthday just for her. If that means hiding a pregnancy for six months, so be it. (This, I realize, is not practical for everyone, our family is spread across three continents, so I have that going for me. Also, this doesn't include my parents or my husband's immediate family who have been immensely supportive.)

Anyhow, on our journey to being ready to try for a second baby:

We don't have any other children, but we do have time breathing down our neck as we are a bit older (I'm 36, he's 43), I said a lot in the beginning that I wouldn't be thinking about having another child for years if we were in our 20s, but since we are in a bit of a time crunch we had to push though.

When we were in the room in the hospital where the doctor took us to tell us that Rhona would never breath on her own again, we held each other and promised that we would have another baby.

That lasted until our first real talk when my husband told me that he wasn't ready to even discuss the issue and he might never be interested in trying again, and if he did it would be entirely for me, not out of any interest of his own. It was heartbreaking, but we have a good solid relationship and know how to communicate with each other. We made ground rules, either of us could talk about whatever we needed to, and either of us could choose not to talk about anything that we weren't ready to. 

I wasn't, and still am not, comfortable with talking about most things related to grieving our daughter with people who haven't lost a child themselves. It's been too difficult, and even the kindest people have made comments that have made the road harder. I'm also a very private person and tend not to want to ""burden"" other people, although at the end of the day I know my husband and I are carrying the heaviest burden. 

So that meant I relied on him a lot for airing my thoughts. Every once in a while when I got the urge I would talk about wanting to get pregnant again, or the timeline, or my fears, and he for the most part wouldn't say anything, or he would help me work through my emotions without actually talking about having another baby. 

I feel like this is getting more long winded than I'd planned, so to cut to the chase. He came around and told me one day that he was ready to have another baby, and that he was excited and it wasn't just something he was doing for me. I honestly don't know what his process was, but I think a lot of it was just having to have ""processed"" a lot of his emotions. 

Cue my excitement, cue my panic. As soon as I realized that it was a possibility I started freaking out. How the hell am I going to sleep? Will I ever be able to use a baby sitter? Will I be over protective to a detrimental point?

I haven't really figured out the answer to any of that, but I have decided that I have at the very, very, most optimistic least, 9.5 months to figure it out.

I think what we both needed was the annoying ""time"" that everyone talks about. Two days ago was the six month anniversary of Rhona's death. I'm sure that doesn't sound like much to someone who is a few years out, but when we had 2-3 months under our belt it seemed like an eternity away. Six months is the length they tend to ascribe to healthy recovery. I've been told again and again that I can grieve however I want ""but if it's still affecting your daily life after six months you should be screened for depression/PTSD."" 

I've passed the six month mark. OF COURSE it's still affecting my daily life. But I'm getting out of bed, and not binge drinking, and mostly realizing there's a future, and not going to bed each night hoping that I won't wake up. So I think that's what they mean. I also don't think 6 months is some magic number. We were ready at 5. But in the beginning I was always searching for someone to give me a timeline, so I'd say that's a realistic one if you're searching for something to base you general planning off of. 

When we decided to try and get pregnant again we made an appointment with both our midwife and our daughter's pediatrician. Going to the pediatrician's office was so hard, but so worth it. She gave us a lot of confidence that what happened was a fluke and not likely to happen again. The midwife agreed to see us at her other office, so we met with her on new territory and she also gave us a lot of confidence. She cried with us and hugged me and said she was so happy for us. She checked in with the doctors at the hospital where Rhona died and chatted with a perinatologist and told us in good faith that we were making the right decision by trying again. 

I really hope you have good doctors who you feel comfortable with, because that was a big step forward in my being ready. Knowing that professionals who knew our case were rooting for us. 

I'm rooting for you, and I'm so happy for you that you already know that you will be ready to try again, even if you don't know when.

So how do you know when you're ready to try again? Well it's really such a personal decision. Ill try to answer as best I can, but my loss (and many of the other people here's losses as well) we're pregnancy losses. The main differences being most of us needed physical healing time before were able to even try again and the family response to the loss would be different with a pregnancy loss vs an infant loss. 

Please keep in mind this is all personal opinion and ultimately  comes down to you and your partner's feelings. I think a lot of being ready has to do with your relationship to your loss. If you still are in a place where you are unable to go through life without constantly being in crippling emotional pain I think bringing another baby into that isn't the best thing for you or them. On the other hand it sounds to me like you have done a great deal of healing and have managed to start living in your new normal. If you believe that you could emotionally handle a potentially difficult pregnancy then I don't see a reason to continue to wait to try. Especially if you're going to worry about the age gap between your living child and your future one. 

Your anxieties is not really something anyone will be able to tell you about because everyone experiences are so different. It may get better if you wait longer, but it may get worse. You may be able to go through your white pregnancy without any medications, but you may also find you don't vote well without them. Talk to your doctor about it and if you're determined to go without them just make sure you're paying attention to yourself and keeping your self care as a top priority and trust your care provider and yourself if you're feeling like you need the meds. 

Stupid people will never go away. I'm sure you will hear horrible and hurtful things for a long time to come. Does having another baby feel like a fix or a replacement to you? If not, then you can actually tell people to go f**k themselves if they choose to comment. If they think it initially it will change when baby arrives and they're able to see them as a different person from your daughter. 


So 

TLDR How do you know when you're ready? If you feel ready to handle the potential challenges that may come up then you are probably ready. It's really up to you though because you're ready when you say you are.

I am about to round out my last little stint in 2nd trimester. What the ever loving fuck. Can&#39;t believe it. Yesterday I puked in the middle of a meeting. Most embarrassing puke to date. To be honest, I&#39;m terrified for the 3rd tri. I am afraid my body will instantly swell, I&#39;ll get GD and my BP will shoot up. Of course I could eat healthier and walk/move, but that hasn&#39;t happened much because (see above puking in meetings). </p>

I went for a short run one morning, and when I returned my mother-in-law said, ""Oh, you went for a run? Good for you!"" But not in an actual supportive way, it was more of a patronizing, I-can't-believe-you-are-exercising-and-endangering-my-grandchild kind of way. So I've wondered, since Sam's death, whether they blame me and think that I was unsafe during my pregnancy. Obviously I was not-- it's perfectly fine to run during pregnancy. (Even though I stopped not long after Christmas because I was peeing too frequently for running to be comfortable.) 

Anyways, playing this game is dangerous. If anyone out there thinks you did anything to cause your son's stillbirth, fuck them. Truly. It's hard enough to wage that battle internally. Of course you did not cause your baby's death. Look how much you love him-- look how you have torn yourself to pieces over it! People don't do that if they intended for such a loss. It's so hard though, to be living in the same skin where the loss occurred. Remember that all those people want to find some justification for Riyad's death so that they can just assure themselves that such a tragedy will never befall them. You and I both know that there's no guarantee of that-- it's just a logical fallacy that people tend to grasp.

Yeah, sometimes I don't have the energy for all of these fucking dumbass people and their voodoo shit. And sometimes I get tempted to move to a different business where no one knows me and my work skills are highly valued. But every place is going to have weirdos and personal talk/gossip I guess.

<p>Etc etc...I mean no wonder I blame myself? My sisters SIL has a five year old boy and she got pregnant with twins last year and miscarried them both at 12 weeks. Her FIL works for us and he told me &quot;she lost her Twins because she went to Vegas with my son to celebrate her pregnancy and...you know, they weren&#39;t careful in the plane&quot; wtf, are you fucking kidding me???</p>

<p>Pretty much the Mediterranean culture I&#39;m around and the older generation really blames the woman for everything, and with the STUPIDEST reasons. Someone told my mom before that my son died because of &quot;a curse.&quot; A curse. Because I got jinxed with the &quot;evil eye&quot; because we had Facebook pictures up of my baby shower.</p>

<p>Yeah, sometimes I don&#39;t have the energy for all of these fucking dumbass people and their voodoo shit. And sometimes I get tempted to move to a different business where no one knows me and my work skills are highly valued. But every place is going to have weirdos and personal talk/gossip I guess. But really, how can I not blame myself when everyone around me is stupid and into these unscientific, medieval theories???</p>

I've had two losses, a 9 week and a 17/18 week. After my second (the 18 week) my OB ran some blood test, which came back to show a positive ANA. Positive ANA tests are just a flag for a potential issue. A specific antibody called anti-Ro/SSA is the main culprit for failed pregnancies, it usually causes second trimester losses but is correlated to first as well. I was referred to a rheumatologist by my OB, from there I was diagnosed with aa autoimmune disorder called Sjorgen's (a mild disease causing dryness in the mucous membranes). Had I not gotten pregnant, I probably would have never found out. 

TRIGGER WARNING: Subsequent pregnancy
I recently had a successful pregnancy resulting in a little boy. I did not go to an RE, so no help there, but was referred to a maternal-fetal medicine specialist at 7 weeks. My OB, rheumatologist, and MFM Doctor worked together as a team during the pregnancy. I was immediately put on 81mg of baby aspirin, (by the MFM) as it ""couldn't hurt"". 

From this point, it was basically a waiting game. Autoimmune disorders can cause a heart block in babies. I had weekly ultrasounds to measure a certain interval in the heart. If something were wrong with this interval, I was to be put on prednisone. Depending on your results, prednisone or other steroids may be an immediate intervention or (like mine) used as damage control if something were to develop. We had a scare that was mild and resolved itself, but was likely the culprit of losing my other pregnancies. This is getting a bit long, so I will end it off here.

I don't know. I guess I'm realizing that I'm not nearly as okay as I thought I was.

So I may push for that if I were you. My follow up came back negative, so I let the ANA go as a possible issue/explanation for my losses. That being said, I did start a baby aspirin later and was happy with that choice. Literally ALL of my repeat loss testing came back negative/normal. My only issues are slightly elevated platelets, low iron stores, and the positive ANA. I never found a true cause for my losses and that is frustrating. But I would recommend baby aspirin. Prednisone, I think, is a much riskier option and you may want to get at least another opinion if all that is wrong is a positive ANA.

<p>If you choose this method, I suggest very clean hands and very short nails. Once you kind of get over the hurdle of doing it a few times it starts to become quite routine.</p>

I mostly wore my normal clothes (even at 34 weeks) because I wear dresses and tights 99% of the time, so I managed not to grow out of things. 

I bought about £200 of maternity and nursing clothes the week before our baby died, so I got my mum to return them to the shop for me except for one dress I was wearing to the hospital when I found out he died. I have that dress in my wardrobe. I see it sometimes. I guess I kept it in case I get pregnant again - because in my head I'm logical, and why would I throw out a perfectly good dress? The illogical side of me thinks I should get rid of it because it's bad luck, and SURELY I don't want to wear it again. Because it's a death dress, obviously? I'm 100% not superstitious at all and I'm really surprised by my thoughts around this. 

The other side of me, like you, is holding on to it because it's what I wore when I was pregnant and it ties me to my boy too. It was the last thing I wore when I thought my baby was alive. It's the item I wore when I found out he was dead. 

If you do decide to get rid of your clothes, you are absolutely not throwing away your pregnancy and that connection you have with your son. I promise.

If you want to maybe keep something from your maternity clothes, maybe pick a favourite item and get a teddy bear made from the fabric or something like that? I don't know if you have a memory box or anything for your son, but we have a collection of little things - a lock of his hair, clay hand and foot prints, some candles, photos etc. I enjoy having these things that make me feel close to him, even if I don't look at them.

So we just sort of let it go this time, had sex for fun one time on a day that could mean something/nothing. I don&#39;t really know how I feel, I couldn&#39;t parse this one out. I did buy a bunch of pregnancy tests and opk strips almost right away and that in a way, scratched the itch, and now I feel like I can let ttc lie for a minute.

Otherwise, I periodically take 3mg of melatonin - it helps me fall asleep and stay asleep and is not habit forming (it can delay ovulation when taken regularly if that becomes a concern, can be useful for IVF though).  I also do a breathing exercise where I (in my head) count up to four as I inhale and down from four as I exhale continuously. If your mind drifts, just bring it back to slow breathing and counting. Otherwise, I read fiction at night until I can&#39;t keep my eyes open anymore.

If he sent me articles as well (instead of just me sending things and getting crickets back), then I would see that he&#39;s engaged and in it with me.</p>

-They are supposedly random-- nothing you can do to cause or prevent them. As I understand it, normally they do not cause a loss, but occasionally do. I'm sorry you were on the crappy end of the statistic, and I'm sorry for the anxiety I know you were feeling as you waited and hoped that it would resolve without further complication.

- I am seeing a fertility acupuncturist at the moment and when I brought up that particular complication in my most recent pregnancy, she told me that she tends to see an outsized number of SCH patients-- she speculated that they are related to extremely elevated hormone levels, since she sees a lot of IVF patients who are on a lot of hormones. Of course, I'm not aware of any data to back this up, but I thought it was interesting and worth mentioning. I never had any hormone intervention with my pregnancy, but I was nursing a toddler when I became pregnant, so I am fairly certain that I had a progesterone imbalance. Maybe that contributed? 

-With my own pregnancy, I had an obvious implantation bleed around 7dpo. Again, no data to back this up, but I've always wondered if the two were related-- like maybe the little bit of blood the embryo created just kept pooling for a few weeks until it had to be released.

-As far as trying again goes, generally speaking they tell you to wait at least one cycle for dating purposes.

I happen to have long cycles, and for each of my pregnancies my due date did not align with my LMP for that reason, but since I knew precisely when I ovulated I also was able to confidently tell my doctors that my fetus was only measuring 7 weeks instead of 8 it was because I had ovulated on CD21 instead of CD14. 

If it were me and I were ready to try again, I probably wouldn't wait until I got through a period-- I'd just count the first day of miscarriage as CD1 and chart it out from there, but if your provider has a more compelling reason to advise you to wait than just for dating purposes, I'd obviously stick with qualified medical advice over what I just told you! 😋😎",[],,t1_dlaro2y,0,False,"<div class=""md""><p>I had a subchorionic hemorrhage with my stillborn baby-- it was unrelated to his term demise, as it resolved around 12 weeks, but I just wanted to let you know a few things I have learned about them:</p>

The way you're describing this makes it look like the pregnancy didn't feel real to him yet. Men aren't the ones carrying the baby. A study I read, which I can find if you're interested, said that men don't really fully connect with the pregnancy until they hold the baby in their arms. Us women have a constant reminder, our boobs hurt when we walk down the stairs, we bloat, throw up, etc. We carry it as well as all the hormones, emotions, and symptoms. We make the plans for the baby shower, the cute little outfits, the colors of the nursery. But a man's only reminder is when they look at our belly or we complain about our symptoms. And for us, since we miscarried so early, these men couldn't see our stomachs or put their hands on them to feel kicks or heartbeats. It probably just didn't feel all that real to him yet, even I had a hard time wrapping my head around it. 
I think the best thing you can do right now is sit down and talk to him about it. I also second couples therapy if that conversation doesn't work out.

I am so scared that I'll never have another baby. And I agree that even though ""anxiety"" is an appropriate term for what I'm feeling, like, of COURSE I'm anxious. My perfectly healthy baby died at 39 weeks for no apparent reason. Like, if something so shitty and terrible and traumatic can happen to me of all people, then why should I believe that anything really good will happen to me, like another baby.

My mind spirals out of control much too easily, too, and on already depressive days, it is even harder to pull myself out of my thought spiral and I feel like I am just throwing every idea I have at the problem and they're all minimally helpful but not totally helpful. I watch mindless TV. I am taking guitar lessons so I have something to do with my hands and somewhere to focus my thoughts when they get out of hand-- I can pick up the guitar and concentrate on that for a half hour. 

I got some good advice from my acupuncturist last week-- you can't change your thoughts with more thoughts. Meditation doesn't really provide much benefit for me-- I'm too fidgety, and all that quiet time where I'm supposed to NOT think just offers a lot of time to, well, think. And my mind doesn't usually go to the hopeful images I've been storing-- the ones where I get to hand a healthy baby to the midwife and nurse who helped to deliver my stillborn baby. Usually my thoughts veer towards months and months of buying tampons, and getting negative pregnancy tests, and wondering just how long I'll have to endure this before I wind up with the family I had ultimately envisioned for myself.  Even my therapist only offers modest protection against these thoughts.

I had nightmares last night about these many months of trying and worrying about no more babies. When I woke up, instead of reminding myself that dreams are just my brains way of working through some feelings, I projected these fears out for years-- what if it never happens? What if this emptiness I have now is always what envelops me?

I don't know that I have any advice for you. The only things I've found that are even remotely helpful is trying to exact as much control over the things I *can* control. I'm monitoring my cycle as carefully as possible. I'm trying to hit all my fertile days as diligently as possible. I'm trying to eat healthy and be as active as my energy will allow me to be. I'm trying to take vitamins and supplements to support hormone balance since my first cycle was SO messed up I couldn't have gotten pregnant even if egg did meet sperm. But there are so many things I can't control-- like how long it does take the body to find equilibrium after a full term birth, or how well our cells are interacting when I ovulate.

Who can blame you? Every time you stick your finger in the outlet, you get the shit shocked out of you. Of course you expect fully to continue to get the shit shocked out of you the next time you do it.  That's how I feel. I've had 4 pregnancies, 2 of which ended with traumatic surgeries, the last one ending with a permanent loss of my natural fertility, and the trauma of each one just compounded the last. 

I do fully expect that the next time I stick my finger in that socket, I'm going to get the shit shocked out of me, again. 

I tried to be more positive with my last pregnancy. First it was with the spotting. It's okay as long as it's not bright red, right? Then with the betas. It's okay if they're low but doubling, right? Then with the pain. It's ok as long as I can function, right? It's all okay until it's not. 

I don't try not to be pessimistic. The majority of my being believes that it'll never fucking work, but there is that undying, invincible little spark of hope that lives inside me, that yes, someday it *will* work. Some day I *will* have a living child, and maybe, if I'm lucky, they'll even make it to adulthood. 

My mind still constantly spirals into worst-case scenarios and worry and fear. Of course it does. I try to combat it with keeping short term goals, trying to only worry about one somewhat tangible milestone after another. What else can I do? I can't believe that it'll all be okay, because my experience has not EVER bore that out. But just because I don't believe it, doesn't mean it won't happen.

Having said that. Yes, I have a hard time sometimes not having a Doom and gloom outlook on the short and long term outcome of our long TTC journey. It's worst from 10dpo to about cd4. Then from cd5 to ovulation, and past to about 7/8/9 dpo, I feel energised, enthused, like things might be different. In the early days that used to include pintresting, amazon wishlist creation, and various other cute optimistic things. Now, probably since miscarriage #3, 6 months ago, it's more like just not feeling bad. Or researching adoption in my province. Or rereading all the papers on repeat loss, the books that have all those happy stories of how women who've had double digit losses (!!!!!!!) have succeeded and had a child.  Which is perhaps healthier, a better coping mechanism or a sign that I'm gotten far too pessimistic about this. 

Mr.Ben is aware of it. He can see how it's changed me. It's hard for us, in different ways. He's sad that things haven't gone the way we hoped (obviously). Where as I'm sad that we don't have a 11 month old, a 7 month old, aren't due next month. And we try to keep communication open and I think we do as well as can be expected given our different perceptions and experiences of this TTC stupidness. 

Stuff that I hope will help - we just met with the RE, and she's given me so much piece of mind. For me my big fears are just how alone I feel in my pregnancies, since to-date the medical community has only gotten involved after I've already miscarried. So the RE was able to offer me earlier involvement. Blood work the same day as a bfp, an ultrasound at 6,8,10 weeks so we know which way things are going. And before all that, so much blood work to rule out obvious causes of loss. All this has done so much to help my headspace. As I said in a hopeful tone last week, ""I don't have to worry, I've delegated that to someone else!"". And that's kind of true right now.  (We'll see how I feel once that elusive bfp comes around....)

Additionally, we have referrals to some counsellors/therapists/psychotherapists who specializes in loss, infertility and the generally misery of TTC for a long time. I'm hopeful those professionals will give me some more tools to help make me less of a basket case. 

The other fear, the bigger fear for me now is the thought that maybe there won't be that bfp. What if those three pregnancies were all I was going to get. Again, RE was able to tell me that she'll worry about that. If I not pregnant at 10 months, book an appointment and will investigate it so that by the time we hit 1 year we've covered it all. That took some anxiety away for me. And I honestly believe her. She'll deal with this, so I'm going to go back to worrying about my garden and dogs and other normal things. 

Lastly, I'm still undercover about our TTC and losses. Our families don't know, and I've told a few coworkers. Friends know. So I don't have to worry about too many shitty comments or stupid questions. So I can't offer advice on how to navigate the shittiness of stupid people.

Everything you said is completely on point. Yes, it seems like my NY doctor advises everyone to wait one cycle, and I feel comforted by the fact that the doctor who assessed me in person saw no obvious issue or reason to wait.

I definitely hear mixed things from different people online, but it can't hurt to ask your doctor - the NP I saw implied that even if I wasn't 35, they would gladly do both as long as I knew insurance might not cover both (although the NIPT test was a lot less expensive than I expected - around $400 with the cash-pay option, I was expecting $1k or more), so if you're prepared for that, they may do whatever you request to help your peace of mind (and at least with my office, they seem to be very accommodating of that in general, but particularly for anyone who's experienced a loss or is otherwise high risk, which is wonderful).

And it's definitely been hard to do ""normal"" pregnancy things with Mr. IHeart, but he himself has been a big motivator for me to try, since he's been supportive of whatever steps I'm willing/able to take and trying to help me feel as comfortable as possible.

Just stupid, irrational thoughts. Sometimes those kinda thoughts attack us, or something small becomes a huge trigger. </p>

<p>You know it&#39;s not your fault Riyad died. How could it be? You have so much love for him. You never did anything other than care for him and love him while he was inside you. He died, but it isn&#39;t a reflection on you. These things just happen. They shouldn&#39;t happen, but they do. </p>

<p>Every time I get down, one of my friends always listens, then tells me that the last thing George would ever want would be for his mummy to be upset over something she couldn&#39;t control. It brings me a tiny bit of comfort. Hang in there &lt;3</p>

It's also a brand new thing I have never done before, so it keeps me hopeful that life will keep having brand new nice things for me to do and discover. And it will outweigh the bad.

One bad thing...yesterday my kitten found a hiding place behind the basement couch and slept there. I was cleaning and my husband opened the door to do something. So we thought she ran out. We looked around the entire house five times, my husband drove around the neighborhood, i was panicking and walked around. Then I irrationally FREAKED out and called my mom (because she lets me be irrational sometimes), saying the cat is gone and that this always happens to me, that I get new things and little lives to take care of, and then they leave me or die, and am I cursed and why does this keep happening, maybe I'm not meant to take care of ANYTHING in my life? I was convinced she was outside or had died somehow and that it was my fault and I failed the kitten just like I failed my son. Yup...all of those garbage thoughts assaulted me yesterday. My husband wasn't panicked at all and was completely rational: he told me there's no way she could have left the house, he opened the door for a second, she's an indoor cat so she would have lingered outside because we looked for her within minutes. And she would pop up on her own. So...as soon as I hung up the phone with my mom the kitten ran up to me from her hiding place. My husband was angry with me because of what I told my mom, and he just guessed at what it was without even speaking to her. 

He calmed down and we talked about it but he told me he was very sad and worried that I would even think something like that...that I still blame myself for my son's death and I connect his death at all to losing a kitten, which isn't rational to do. And both things wouldn't have been my fault either. I see now what he is saying and I'm much more grounded now but those thoughts just assaulted me out of nowhere. But I suppose it's normal.

I did the 1 hour GD test thing on Monday and got my results last night via their online portal - my blood sugar was only at 42. All my OB noted on the message was &quot;your results are OK and you don&#39;t have to do the 3 hour test&quot;. </p>

<p>But 42 seems really low to me...I mean, granted, they had me eat about 3 hours before I drank the stuff, so that was the only thing in my system for 4 hours before the draw. Still, the lab results say &quot;expected range: 65-140&quot; and 42 is obviously well below 65.

<p>I think I&#39;ll cut my hair now, it&#39;s always cathartic for me. </p>

<p>I&#39;m really dreading going to work tomorrow. Everyone knows I am pregnant and talks about it a lot, which was lovely, when everything was going well, it felt like a fun club. But now I am going to have to drop the bad news and I just don&#39;t want to talk about it or hear anyone&#39;s stories or get sympathetic looks. I guess I am shoring myself up to not cry, too, because I am doing patient care all day and it is so awkward taking care of people when you are crying. </p>

<p>I will probably take a day or two off next week for the D&amp;C. </p>

<p>Looking at the calendar, it will be another week or two til the d&amp;c, then 2 weeks to heal, then I will probably wait a cycle to try again... Kind of depressing watching those months tick by. We will probably be able to start trying again around the time we thought we would find out gender. Bleh. </p>

I also confided in my boss and our education lead to tackle areas of confidence in working with certain patient groups. For now I feel I am in a better place mentally but I am aware that could change. Working in health and social care you can see a lot of things that the rest of the population do not see or have to deal with, things that even if you don&#39;t have your own problems to deal with can leave you upset or distressed. Please think about seeing a counsellor or therapist to talk this through and confide in someone you work with. It really sucks having a loss, trying to care for yourself and your partner, while having to professionally care for other people. Things do get better eventually but it takes time, look after yourself and know that you are not alone in feeling like this.</p>

To be honest with you I had such a hard time with my job after my loss I had to seek professional help. I went to therapy and it helped a lot. I had a specific type of therapy done called EMDR. My loss was very traumatic after some of the medical events surrounding it and I could not process it. EMDR (Eye movement desensitization and reprocessing) was super helpful to me. I would encourage you to find a therapist that you are comfortable with and that you can talk with about all these emotions. Being a social worker for child protective services is hard enough not having to deal with a loss your own child.

Tl;dr: clinic fucked up my monitored cycle and missed my ovulation, didn't go ahead with IUI but managed to get pregnant ourselves. 

I guess I'll be the first to post. I had a positive hpt at 9dpo after a cancelled IUI cycle that was medicated. 

I had a D&C in May after it was discovered that the heartbeat had stopped around 8 weeks. I had retained tissue, so several days after the procedure I was given misoprostol, and it worked pretty effectively. But, it would be over six weeks until I got my period. 

We wanted to try another IUI since the last one was successful. I was given clomid 50 mg from CD 3-7. Monitoring throughout showed several follicles, but ultimately I ended up with one, around 16 mm. 

At this point I was going into my RE's office almost every day for monitoring. I had been using OPKs myself too so when I got a blazing positive on Tuesday July 18th I knew it would happen soon. I went in that day, had blood taken and a transvag ultrasound. The rule is, if they want you to come in the very next day or same day, they call, otherwise it's assumed you come in every other day. I was paranoid because I was convinced I was about to ovulate so I actually still went in on Wednesday. 

I got no call from the clinic, so I guess my follicle wasn't juicy enough yet? I go in on Thursday, same monitoring as usually. Get a call that same day telling me to come back in the morning for the IUI because I was surging on my own. That same evening I feel ovulation cramps (I am very sensitive and believe I feel it almost every month) around 5pm. Fuck, it's too early, at this point I'm hoping I'm wrong. 

Go in Friday morning, U/S tech tells me I ovulated, I tell her about the cramps and which side, and she confirms that's probably what my cramping was. At this point my husband has given his sample for processing, but by the time it's ready it'll be 11:30 am and over 17 hours since I ovulated. 

I manage to corner one of the nurses and ask to see my labs from the week. We look at them together and I recognize right away that I should have come in Thursday morning for the IUI based on my hormone levels since it was obvious I was surging Wednesday/Thursday. Of course, that was the day they didn't call me. I asked her why and she said she honestly had no idea, seemed genuinely concerned and said she'd speak to the doctor about it. 

I knew my doc would make up some sort of excuse, which she did, and she insisted I go ahead with the IUI anyway.  I laughed at this point and asked her how long the egg typically survives after being released, and she says up to 36 hours. 

At this point I'm seeing red, I want to kind of slap her. After a year of infertility you know how long a fucking egg lives in the Fallopian tubes and it ain't 36 hours, more like up to 24 but not likely that long. Even if there was a chance in hell that my sad little 16 mm follicle released an egg that was strong enough to survive for 36 hours, there was no fucking way I was paying over $400 for the IUI for a 1:10 000 chance. I tell her to forget about it all, and leave. 

I got a call after the weekend from the clinic telling me that we owe $430 for the sperm processing from Friday. I told the lady to speak to my doctor about it, and I haven't heard from them since. I went in today to grab more progesterone and there is no balance on my account.

I started the pills on a Friday morning, laid around feeling horrible Saturday and Sunday, and worked half a day on Monday before the pain got to be too much. On Tuesday, I worked for about an hour before I was doubled over in the worst pain since it all started. I called and asked for a refill of the pain meds, and they didn't seem concerned when I asked if it was still supposed to be hurting so much. My husband wanted to go to the ER because it was so bad, but the bleeding was no worse than a heavy period by then, so I didn't want to go. Tuesday night, I finally passed the sack, and after that the pain let up. I said over and over that I would never do that again.

I figured that if I finally got pregnant after 4 years of trying, I wanted to do as little to my body as possible out of concern for future chances. I asked the doctor giving me my options what she would do in my position, and she said that it had happened to her also, and she&#39;d chosen the D&amp;C because she just wanted it over with. I ended up picking the pills. It was incredibly painful (physically) and the Lortabs barely took the edge off. It wasn&#39;t the worst pain I&#39;ve ever felt, but it lasted the longest. I started the pills on a Friday morning, laid around feeling horrible Saturday and Sunday, and worked half a day on Monday before the pain got to be too much. On Tuesday, I worked for about an hour before I was doubled over in the worst pain since it all started. I called and asked for a refill of the pain meds, and they didn&#39;t seem concerned when I asked if it was still supposed to be hurting so much. My husband wanted to go to the ER because it was so bad, but the bleeding was no worse than a heavy period by then, so I didn&#39;t want to go. Tuesday night, I finally passed the sack, and after that the pain let up. I said over and over that I would never do that again. Now 4 months out I&#39;m not so sure...If it happens again, I think I&#39;d do the D&amp;C if I was offered repeat loss testing, but otherwise I&#39;d want to pass it at home again so I can bury my baby. It&#39;s all about weighing what&#39;s important to you. While the choice is far from easy, neither choice is wrong. </p>

I had 2 d and cs after my first loss, second one ultrasound-guided, and still had tissue that ended up causing (most likely, according to my RE) a 13 week loss when I got pregnant next. I ended up with a hysteroscopy after that which seems to have been successful, but a lot of time and heartache could have been saved if I&#39;d had it sooner.  It was not much different than a d and c in terms of pain etc, in fact not bad at all, so I&#39;d highly recommend doing it now.

This happened to me with my first child, too, and nothing stopped it then either, but my mom treated that as though I was just trying to rationalize a different explanation than the much more obvious one that she thought was the culprit. She had three kids. I cannot believe she does not remember going temporarily bald when we were babies.

I've been keeping my parents at arms length since Sam's stillbirth-- partially because I just prefer my space when I'm going through something, but also because when my cousin had a baby boy after Sam died, I brought it up with them. They said in sort-of understanding tones, ""I'm sure that's really hard for you. Of course we're happy for Cousin, but it's sad for you."" And I just felt like I was being talked down to like a child-- they were morally coaching me on how to feel for someone who had enough happiness of her own that she didn't need mine, too-- right after my own baby died. I understand that my parents are grieving too, but the way they are doing it just doesn't work for me and I can't take it on top of my own grief, so it's easier to just keep them at a distance, because when we do talk they tend to say shit that irritates or angers me and it's easier to just say nothing.

Well this is just bizzare. 

At work with (older male) coworker with whom I have at least twice told that I've had multiple miscarriages. In the context of discussing dead spouses, children, grandparents, parents, and how the afterlife may or may not work, be... All that philosophical shit you talk about when you spend hours in the car together. Generally we have a good relationship, I can ask him some mentor type stuff, and he can get philosophical and I respond in kind. 

So anyways, we're working today, sitting at lunch and he asks me if we want kids. I'm a bit bemused, with a sinking feeling.

Well yes, we do want kids. 

Oh. That surprises me!

Really? Because I know I've mentioned the miscarriages we've had...

Oh yeah. But that could be from being irresponsible.

And then the phone rang which fortunately has kept me from inquiring as neutrally as I could manage if it was possible he was confused on what a miscarriage is....

So now I am left wondering if I really come across as irresponsible, (to the point of deliberately being bad at BC and needing elective pregnancy terminations 3 times?????). Is this how I come across? 

Or is it possible this man is a homogenous idiot? (Okay it was supposed to be enormous idiot, but autocorrect decided that wasn't what I meant and I think that it's funnier as it corrected it)

So yeah..... Not making waves, not going to bring this up with him again. 6 hours to go at work. I think we'll let this issue fizzle and die and never bring it up again. 😶

So my logic brain says it's not likely that I ovulated the week after my D&C (I still was getting a faint postive on HPTs Saturday, so I'm assuming Monday is when it dropped). I'm sure my hormones are out of whack and I know I may not even ovulate this cycle. I never scheduled a follow up for my d&c and my ob's office have been class A jerks this whole process. I figured because the HPT was negative (have had two negatives so far), no retained products. Spotting stopped after 5 days, though cramping remains. Now I'm torn because I probably should get my YI checked out, but I'm also low-key hoping it's an early sign of pregnancy. I also never want to step foot back in that office.

Anyway, I&#39;m kind of just sitting tight and letting whatever happens, happen; it&#39;s not like I can do anything right now if this pregnancy is doomed to end as another CP/MC.</p>

I think some of this is driven by fear and apprehension about meeting with the Infertility clinic and talking to someone who knows wtf they are talking about regarding repeat pregnancy loss.

It technically started the day before when I started having this weird cramp in my calf - I put on compression stockings and elevated my legs and the pain went away. Then yesterday, I was taking a nap in the afternoon and when I woke up I felt super strange, first I was really disoriented (where am I? what is happening?), then just felt off and weird, and ... stressed - except no distressing thoughts or reasons to be stressed - and finally I realized I could hear my heartbeat and was having heart palpitations. That was super strange since I had just woken up. So I checked my blood pressure and it was 128/60 - which for me is high. I typically have low blood pressure (usually 90/60) so while 128 isn't that bad, it's still very odd for me, especially considering I had just woken up from a nap. Then, I realized I had urine dipsticks at home so I tested my urine. The first stick showed glucose, a tiny bit of protein, and bilirubin. Then I decided to re-test because maybe the stick was defective; so after drinking some water I tested again and this time it was better; but still showed some protein and glucose. By then I started to really to stress out. I retested my blood pressure and it had gone down a bit. I have a glucose meter at home so I tested my blood and thankfully my glucose in blood was in a normal range, phew. But that's not all. By then DH had gotten back from work and I told him about what had happened and we had agreed we will call the clinic in the morning and try to get an earlier appointment (my next one is in a week). But alas, suddenly my pinkie went numb! That was the last straw - it scared the shit out of me. DH promptly checked this symptom online and assured my that it's just carpal tunnel syndrome but by then I had just burst with tears from frustration and fear.. and told him that's definitely not carpal tunnel because it feels different (never had carpal tunnel so really I have no idea how it feels). Then the numbness travelled to the next finger, then to the middle finger (by this time my pinkie felt normal), and it went all the way to the thumb and wrist. But that's when it stopped. My forearm felt a bit weird but that was all. It was super fucking scary and I was seriously considering just going to the hospital. But when it stopped, everything seemed to have calmed down so we decided to wait it out and stick to the plan of calling the clinic in the morning.

This morning I called my clinic; turns out my OB is away so they gave me his phone number. I texted him with the symptoms (oh and this morning there were also leukocytes in my urine) and asked him what to do - he said that leukocytes and protein are probably from vaginal secretions and that we can wait for now until next week friday's appointment, and if the symptoms happen again/ worsen to go to the hospital. OK... so for now I guess I will just wait and see - but I know my body and I know something is happening that shouldn't be happening. This morning, right after waking up, I tested my blood pressure and it was 125/65. Urine still is showing weird things (just now it showed nitrates in urine, but no glucose). All of these things in urine could potentially be signs of pre-ecmapsia. Oh and since about a week ago my fingers are swollen (a normal symptom I know, but all of them together - it's super suspicious).

My gyn just called me with the beta results.  I *am* pregnant, but the hCG numbers are very low, consistent with a conception about 1-2 weeks ago.  Since my estimated ovulation day is maybe 1 week and 2-3 days ago from today and the blood sample was taken 2 days ago, those numbers are in-line with expectations.  He referred me to a doctor who specializes in high-risk obstetrics and infertility, and who also does deliveries (my gyn does not). He also told me what to tell them to get prioritized for an appointment.  If I can't get an appointment with the specialist next week, he told me to go back and see him again on Monday so I can get more blood drawn for another beta test.  Even if I start bleeding over the weekend, I should still get another blood test since then we should see the numbers going down.  The specialist's office is closed now so I'll try calling tomorrow.  Regardless of what happens, whether this pregnancy stays or ends in a CP again, my gyn says I should still keep the genetic counselor appointment I have in ~1 week as whatever they do will have no impact on pregnancies.

This feels big to me.  It's like confirmation that I haven't been running around like a crazy person claiming 4 CPs of which only 1 was semi-confirmed by the fact that my period was a week late before I started bleeding.

<p>My gyn just called me with the beta results.  I <em>am</em> pregnant, but the hCG numbers are very low, consistent with a conception about 1-2 weeks ago.  Since my estimated ovulation day is maybe 1 week and 2-3 days ago from today and the blood sample was taken 2 days ago, those numbers are in-line with expectations.  He referred me to a doctor who specializes in high-risk obstetrics and infertility, and who also does deliveries (my gyn does not). He also told me what to tell them to get prioritized for an appointment.  If I can&#39;t get an appointment with the specialist next week, he told me to go back and see him again on Monday so I can get more blood drawn for another beta test.  Even if I start bleeding over the weekend, I should still get another blood test since then we should see the numbers going down.  The specialist&#39;s office is closed now so I&#39;ll try calling tomorrow.

Your temperature rises after you ovulate and stays elevated for the duration of your cycle because your body releases progesterone following ovulation. Progesterone is the hormone that nourishes a pregnancy. If no pregnancy occurs, progesterone drops at the end of your cycle, triggering your period. If you do become pregnant you keep producing progesterone to sustain the pregnancy until the placenta takes over the job of nourishing the fetus.

If you want to predict ovulation for timing purposes you are definitely better off using OPKs or learning to read your body's cues signaling your fertile period. Personally, my OPKs don't show a positive until the day I ovulate, so even they aren't terribly predictive. That varies from woman to woman though. If you were really interested in learning more about identifying your fertile period to better pinpoint the ideal timing for sex, then I'd recommend a comprehensive overview of how fertility works, like the book ""Taking Charge of your Fertility"" by Toni Wechsler.

I am thinking of going to an RE to check all of these things out but I don't know if they will take me if I haven't been TTC longer than 6 months?

I have what I think is a UTI so I went to the doctor today to check it out. I also went to a general doctor for blood work. Of course the super friendly nurse asked if I have any kids, and I hesitated for a considerably long time before replying with ""not yet.""

My husband is asexual and we never really had that much sex to begin with (which I was fine with before he said he wanted to ttc), so ttc hasn't always been very fun for us. The first 9 months of us trying I had to pull teeth to get him to BD on the right days, and even though he really wants a kid he is against the turkey-baster method since it is ""unnatural"" and not how he wants to remember the conception of his child haha.

The end of the 9th month I admitted my frustration and how hopeless I was feeling about it all since I hadn't even had a false positive yet, and he decided that he'd ""really try"" this month because he was frustrated to have seen four co-workers announce pregnancies and two have those same babies since we started trying. 

So we did it every other day for two weeks surrounding my fertile week, only to find that I ovulated late for the first time ever and never got a positive O test. And then a close family member suddenly passed away and we only had sex once in the two weeks after, which happened to be the one day that week I took an O test and it came out blazing positive..... but apparently it took! We were so excited and happy. But then the miscarriage happened, obviously.

Last month when we started trying again, it was back to pulling teeth to BD on time. We did it twice in my fertile week and haven't BDed or had sex for fun since. My fertile week is this next week and I hinted to my husband that we should probably start doing it every other day again and he just ""doesn't feel like it"" and said I should let him know once I get the positive ovulation test.

So frustrating. Why couldn't the last one just have took :/ I don't want to force sex that he isn't excited for but he keeps staring longingly every time he sees a kid and whispering to me that he wants one and that it should definitely happen this month. I'm doing all I can haha. /rant
