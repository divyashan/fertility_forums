I know that I have mixed feelings with every new theory and test result. It's hard to hear what went wrong, but there's some relief too if it means it might be preventable in the future...

My MFM and OB suspect that I have a clotting disorder, based on the suddenness of our losses, but I don't have any of the common ones that are tested for. I am a carrier for alpha thalassemia, which may be the culprit for blood clotting. Unfortunately, there's not much data on this - most sufferers are Asian (I'm white/celtic in origin), studies almost exclusively focus on the minor and major versions since those are very serious or fatal, and most American doctors don't have a lot of experience with it. So there are a lot of question marks there.

I also have a paracentric chromosomal inversion on chromosome 13 that may have played a role in our earlier losses. I'm the only person in the databases with my particular chromosomal abnormality. There are 5 or 6 cases of people with inversions on the same chromosome. The geneticists we've spoken can give us some theoretical analysis of what my inversion might mean for us, but definitely no studies. We've heard everything from ""no effect"" to ""trouble conceiving"" (we've conceived 7 times in 2 years, so we're not seeing that) to ""80% miscarriage rate before 6 weeks, but no increased risk after 8 weeks and a heartbeat."" We've lost a baby at 10 weeks and, most recently, at 16 weeks, as well as two 7 week losses and 3 chemical pregnancies. Unfortunately, we only have karyotype results for our 16 week loss - which was a chromosomally normal baby boy - but my 7 and 10 week losses didn't really fit the normal pattern of chromosomal losses. So we really don't know what impact, if any, my chromosomal abnormality has.

I guess my take-away from all of this is that rare issues suck :( I'm sorry you are dealing with that too.

Have you had a chance to talk with a maternal/fetal medicine specialist or a hematologist? My husband and I are trying again too and it's terrifying, but I have felt better after our appointments.

<p>My MFM and OB suspect that I have a clotting disorder, based on the suddenness of our losses, but I don&#39;t have any of the common ones that are tested for. I am a carrier for alpha thalassemia, which may be the culprit for blood clotting. Unfortunately, there&#39;s not much data on this - most sufferers are Asian (I&#39;m white/celtic in origin), studies almost exclusively focus on the minor and major versions since those are very serious or fatal, and most American doctors don&#39;t have a lot of experience with it. So there are a lot of question marks there.</p>

<p>I also have a paracentric chromosomal inversion on chromosome 13 that may have played a role in our earlier losses. I&#39;m the only person in the databases with my particular chromosomal abnormality. There are 5 or 6 cases of people with inversions on the same chromosome.

My husband and I have lost seven babies in the 1st and 2nd trimesters and we don't have any living children. We've always started trying as soon as we were medically cleared to try again, typically within a month of our losses.

Part of the reason we've always returned immediately to ""not trying/not avoiding"" or even ""trying"" to get pregnant is that, for us, it's felt more natural and comforting to be open to the possibility of conceiving than to intentionally avoid pregnancy. It just feels awful to avoid pregnancy when we'd love to have a baby in our arms. 

I don't want to gloss over how scary it is to try again. I am very afraid of losing our next baby. I worry about so many aspects of pregnancy. But I don't think time would help me get over that fear. After so many losses, we will never have the naive faith that bad things cannot happen to our family. So, we've decided to take the ""be afraid and do it anyway"" approach.

It helps to focus on why we're risking our hearts this way. I know we've been bowled over by how much we love each of our babies. Every time we've lost a baby, I think to myself, ""I could never love another baby the way I love *this* baby,"" but when we conceive again, I feel my heart stretch and I *do* love that baby. I wouldn't wish any of our children away, even though their deaths have caused me so much pain. If that's how I feel now, I can only imagine the joy and love I would feel after delivering our healthy baby or watching him learn to walk or sending him to his first day of kindergarden. That big picture really makes me want to be pregnant again.

Deciding to try again is a really personal decision, so I think it's going to be a little different for every couple. I hope you get a variety of responses so you can see the full spectrum. I think my husband and I are pretty far on the ""try again, as soon as possible"" side of the spectrum.",[],,t1_duh6sg4,False,0,[],False,"<div class=""md""><p>I am so sorry for your loss.</p>

I gave birth to the twins at twenty weeks, so we got to hold them and spend time with them. This procedure is going to rip her into pieces but the only comfort I have is she won‚Äôt feel pain.

<p>And that‚Äôs it. </p>

<p>Edit: I know I said I hate this sub but I really don‚Äôt mostly just frustrated with feeling in limbo again. Thank you for your support and even if you just read this, thank you. </p>

<p>None of us deserve the pain we‚Äôve gone through- but it‚Äôs here and I am very thankful to have you all. Since this is the alumni thread- I think it‚Äôs safe to say all I want for you all is to have boring pregnancies. I love you all. </p>

My OB and MFM suspect that I have a clotting disorder because of the way we've lost our babies - sudden fetal demise without any warning like slow growth, out-of-range heartbeats, etc. We've also lost a baby in the 2nd trimester, at 16 weeks. Sudden fetal demise in the 2nd or 3rd trimester is considered a red flag for clotting disorders.

My MFM said that it can be tricky to diagnose clotting issues because we can't perfectly imitate how blood clots inside the body in labs. Instead, we test individually for the genetic and acquired conditions that we know about. They discover new genetic thrombophilias relatively frequently, but it can take years for large scale studies to happen and trickle down into medical practice. There are also big gaps in the research - for example, almost all the research has been done in predominantly white populations, so there's not a lot of research in other ethnic groups. I am a carrier of alpha thalassemia, which is very rare in white populations, but relatively common in Asian populations (I'm white, so definitely weird there). It's thought to increase clotting risk in general but there's very little research on it, especially during pregnancy. It's not part of a recurrent loss panel.

This is why some doctors advocate that couples with unexplained recurrent loss, especially with any loss after the 1st trimester, ""just try"" aspirin or even heparin/lovenox. There is some logic to this approach and there's also some evidence that it works.

My husband and I have met with 4 MFMs in the past couple months and they don't all agree with this approach. They were all at reputable institutions - two were heads of their departments. We had one doctor recommend just trying again, though he said that he didn't think taking aspirin was risky, just not likely to help. We had two doctors encourage aspirin, and we had the MFM we were already working with encourage us to try lovenox (a type of heparin) and aspirin. To my husband and I, our MFM and OB's approach makes the most sense, so we're going to try lovenox and baby aspirin.

There are risks to baby aspirin. One of the more common but still relatively rare complications is gastrointestinal bleeding (ulcers). There is also a very small increase in your risk of a hemorrhagic stroke (stroke caused by a burst blood vessel), which is very, very serious. These risks are higher if you are taking other medications or supplements that decrease clotting, like ibuprofen or fish oil (or heparin, but that requires a prescription so you'd be talking to your doctor about this anyway).

On the other hand, there are also risks to having an undiagnosed and untreated blood clotting disorder, especially during pregnancy. Clotting events can be fatal for mom, not just baby, so ignoring a suspected clotting disorder is not without risk.

I think it's worth talking to your doctor about this. If your doctor has a strong recommendation one way or the other, I would consider it carefully and maybe get another opinion if you aren't sure of their advice. If your doctor is neutral - doesn't think it's risky but isn't sure if it will help - I would personally feel comfortable making a judgement call, but I'd also understand wanting to get another opinion in that situation.",[],,t1_duf9oo6,False,0,[],False,"<div class=""md""><p>In my experience, the approach to clotting disorders seems to really vary between doctors.

I'm so, so sorry.  I've had three miscarriages now with a living child in between the second and third miscarriage.  I hope that's okay to mention--when I'm in my darkest times it helps me to hear stories where people have had lots of miscarriages like I have and still somehow seem to have some healthy living children thrown in there.  And, from my research, that seems to be the norm, which I have to keep telling myself: it's very likely that even with several miscarriages, you will end up with a healthy child.  That's what my OB says.  That's what my RE says.  That's what so many articles I've read say.  

Even so, crossing the ""three"" threshold is/was somehow so much worse to me than the two.  Like, I could reason that two was just terrible luck, but three?  Something's wrong.  Something they're never gonna find (I don't know this for certain but I suspect it).  Will I ever be the mother I had planned on being?  I surely never thought I would experience this.   

I've had a hysteroscopy and 7DPO progesterone tested (both normal), and am planning on what my RE's office considers ""standard RPL testing"" in the next week (whenever my period comes).  I'm not feeling particularly confident that the testing will turn up anything (I mean, do I even want it to?  Who knows.).   

I do wonder, for you, though, if testing might turn up some sort of blood clotting issue.  Those tend to result in early second trimester losses, from what I understand, and are treatable with blood thinners.  Have any of your pregnancies' tissues been tested for abnormalities?

I live in Europe and you don't need a prescription here. . Though whether they have it at pharmacies differs per country.

Which is so surprising considering apparently so many people can't process folic acid?
I think I'd better start on baby aspirin as well.. Are you going to start taking it already when TTC?
Thing about misoprostol is that even if you don't actively start miscarrying, it will soften/slightly dilate the cervix, which means that if you have a D&C/D&E (which is what happens if misoprostol doesn't work), less force can be used to dilate the cervix manually. And this lowers the likelihood of you having an incompetent cervix in the future. (something to pay attention to in the future, an incompetent cervix can lead to infection/water breaking in the second trimester. Can be solved by putting a stitch on your cervix early 2nd trimester) 
I guess misoprostol is always worth a try, even though D&C is definitely easier to handle psychologically.
I agree about drama and sadness. And the worst thing is, it takes so f-ing long before you can start to heal. That's one thing I wish someone had told me, that miscarrying takes ages, physically and psychologically. They should teach that at school. 
Just remember to be kind to yourself and take things day by day. And don't run away from emotions because otherwise they will come back one day or another, and it's more difficult to deal with them in the future.

Well, as you can see from my flair, we've had similar experiences. We lost our son in November at 16 weeks -- he was on track for growth, chromosomally normal, with a great heartbeat. We heard his heartbeat one morning and it was gone the next -- no answers, everything tested normal.

Have you done any kind of RPL testing? It's not always useful (it was not in our case), but it is for some. I am not a doctor, but my wife and I have done a ton of research. Missed miscarriages are somewhat rare. Even rarer is a missed miscarriage in the second trimester. We've spoken to quite a few MFMs at this point, and most seem to agree that sudden death that's seemingly random (as opposed to a couple that always miscarries at the same time over and over) can be a sign of a thrombophilia -- abnormal blood clotting. Basically, the body for whatever reason is predisposed to forming clots and these can land up in the placenta and block blood to the baby.

There are a few tests they can run, but they do not always know why some people form clots. After our sudden second trimester loss, my wife's doctor has insisted my wife try blood thinners in the next pregnancy, and we are hoping that will work for us.

There are not many other things that cause second trimester miscarriage. Gamete quality isn't really much of a factor (especially if the baby tests as chromosomally normal) -- you wouldn't have made it this far if the gametes were bad. By 12 weeks the baby is pretty much completely formed and just needs to be connected to the mother to get sustenance, oxygen and grow. From what we've been told and what I've read, the most common cause by far of second trimester loss is uterine abnormalities, but these result in premature labor or IUGR, not sudden death, so it's unlikely it would cause a missed miscarriage without any signs. Hormones are also not much of a factor. The only one I can think of that could cause issues is progesterone, but low progesterone is only theorized to result in pre-term labor, and there's not even consensus on whether progesterone is important to maintain a pregnancy that's that far along.

Unfortunately, second trimester loss is very uncommon (16 weeks is supposed to literally be the safest time during pregnancy), and the most common reason for it is uterine abnormalities. Unfortunately, we both have managed to find ourselves in the really uncommon part of the miscarriage world (as if it didn't get shitty enough). As you've found out, standards of care differ wildly. My wife was actually not offered induction (although she really wanted it), and only a D&E. We were told that was hospital policy, but my guess is that there are so few patients coming in for a loss at 16 weeks that there's not much of a policy. Could you try pushing back to see if they'll budge?

Again, so sorry for your loss. I hope you do find the will to try again. For what it's worth, not having a pattern to your losses is a good sign. Losing babies at the same stage over and over again generally has a poorer prognosis than losing them randomly.",[],,t1_dubtws4,,0,,False,"<div class=""md""><p>I&#39;m so sorry from your loss.</p>

Why would this be true? It could be a brilliant team of highly motivated doctors, or it could be an assembly line that only works for women with the most routine pregnancies, or it could be somewhere between those extremes. I already told you how much I love my doctor so I'll skip that part, but I will say that she's a one-woman show.

One advantage of a doctor who owns their own practice is that they get to set the rules. For example, they can decide to stay open late, so you can swing by with an urgent issue in the evening. Or they can tell the secretary, who works for them and not some corporate office, to schedule an appointment for 60 minutes instead of 10. 

I  think it's absolutely worth looking around for a doctor who is responsive, compassionate, and good at addressing your worries.

My husband and I lost our baby boy at 16 weeks and before that we lost six babies in the first trimester. ""Trying again"" again is very emotional for both of us. We are constantly trying to reassure ourselves that the new treatments we're trying/will try while pregnant might work, analyzing every ache and twinge, etc. It's very hard. We aren't waiting to try again because I don't think time will help, so we're going for the ""be afraid and do it anyway"" approach.

It has helped to add some relaxing habits to my day, especially in the evening before bed. A hot shower, soaking my feet in a tub of hot water, reading fantasy novels, drinking tea, etc, can really help. 

Sometimes it helps to do something distracting and physical too. Cleaning and cooking are good ones for me - at least then I can be stressed and depressed in a clean home with frozen meals in the fridge ;) I typically don't have a big day-long to-do list, I just decide to get one little thing done and then I realize I have enough energy for another little thing. 

>I‚Äôm scared if this time did work my stress and sadness messed it up

I've worried about this too. I have talked to my OB and she has reassured me that this is just not possible. It is normal to be worried and anxious about your baby's health when you are pregnant after loss (or just pregnant, lots of women worry even without the trauma of losing a child). Every woman with a living child after loss was stressed - and they still had a living child. Women under major, major stresses - like conceiving a baby through rape or living in a war zone - have healthy babies all the time. 

In some ways, I find myself wishing it were as simple as eating the right things, not being stressed, etc, because that would put all of this back in my control. It's hard to relinquish that control and accept that what I'm going through is rare and it's not about lifestyle or stress levels or something I'm doing. It's much harder to wrap my mind around the other possibilities :(

They told me at the hospital the risk of it was 1:100, but then afterwards I saw statistics like that and really freaked out and was angry that they told me such a low risk.

I had an MMC discovered only at 12.5 weeks, embryo measuring only 8.5 weeks, and had a D&C (this was after my first IUI which succeeded). As I was already undergoing infertility treatment, putting anything else on top of whatever was already wrong was not a nice prospect. I could of course never get a hysteroscopy to check, but managed to get another flowing saline ultrasound (can't really see a lot of adhesions with this though) where I'm not even sure they knew they were supposed to be looking for adhesions because they did it so damn fast. But at least there was nothing overtly obviously wrong there. Anyway, I haven't had any problem pointing to adhesions, including having success again but then miscarrying again with my 4th IUI (I did misoprostol that time which worked, to avoid another surgery and increase risk of adhesions again). You can check my comment history if you want to see more about where I'm at with this. But trust me I was super nervous with the 2 failed IUIs before that, yikes. The third one was so perfect, 3 mature follicles, perfect timing, and still failed.

If you're just talking about natural cycles, I don't think you have a lot to worry about just yet, since I think most minor adhesions discovered in a study like that won't even affect fertility much. I'm not sure if you would ""qualify"" to start infertility treatments, but the success rate will be much higher with an IUI and if those all still fail, then something might be wrong. The only universal solution that I see for it, other than waiting and having infertility, is probably paying privately for a hysteroscopy - since they'll likely need more evidence of a problem before that would likely be covered. It sucks but I think even with that 30% number, it's much more uncommon that it's severe and it really affects things.

EDIT: and your period will be wonky for some cycles after a MC. After my D&C, I also got a very watery and weird ""period"" about 5 weeks afterwards, when my hCG had not even totally dropped to zero yet - in retrospect I think it was not really a true period, as I did an IUI cycle starting right when I got that and it went very strangely with slow follicle growth, not at all like the other IUIs. My first ""real"" period after the D&C the cycle after that was also like 6 days late with a week of spotting beforehand and then it really finally came. After misoprostol, it also took about 5 weeks to get my period despite that one being an earlier MMC at 8 weeks, but that one seemed ""real"". Also, your MMC was quite early, which will greatly reduce the chance of adhesions vs. mine at 12.5 weeks. During those extra 4 weeks I had carrying, the placenta was still going and my bump was growing.

Yes, you can get pregnant even with untreated adhesions. 

No, we don't know what causes it. It's most common after repeat D&C for retained products in the case of miscarriage, or after D&C after delivery for retained placenta. It's rare after elective terminations. Is it the procedure that causes the scarring or is it that uteruses which are prone to retaining stuff are more likely to get scarred?

Period changes don't necessarily mean you have scarring, and no change doesn't mean you don't have it.

My doctor tried to still be positive, and ordered blood work to check hcg beta levels, But I knew. A week later it was confirmed. It&#39;s hard at first. DH and I wanted a September baby so bad! It&#39;s hard to let go of the dream you had, no matter how short or long of a time you had it. But I will say, for me so far, it does get better. Even though I&#39;m only just now going through the last of the process. Learning just how many women go through these losses,  and reddit communities here have really helped me accept that this kind of thing just... happens, and to anyone. It sucks, always, but it&#39;s not the end. If you do end up with bad news, take time to grieve with your DH. Talk about it. Be sad. But don&#39;t be afraid to look forward to trying again! This is a bump in the road. Good luck.  &lt;3 </p>

Yes, I absolutely have. And I *love* my OB, so it's not that. After seven losses, I'm just so frustrated and sometimes it spills over in weird ways :\

>I kind of want to switch OB offices, but then I think ""they're probably all the same.""

During my first pregnancy and loss, I went to a midwife clinic and then, after our baby died, saw a different doctor. The doctor was horrible. The midwives were very kind and if it weren't for my first loss, I probably would have appreciated their low-intervention approach, but given that experience I really wanted an approach with more monitoring and more intervention. 

I asked around and found an OB who was willing to run tests for hormonal issues after one loss, instead of waiting for 2+. I knew I liked her at the first appointment - she was kind but frank, called our baby a baby (the previous doctor had used the phrase ""just a bunch of cells,"" so rude!), and she spent over an hour with us. Obviously we haven't gotten any miracle cures, but I am so thankful we have had such a compassionate and pro-active doctor helping us as we've navigated the loss of our babies. We've been getting a lot of opinions from maternal/fetal medicine doctors and they've all been impressed with her thorough testing, and I know my husband and I feel so confident with her care. Just this week, she spent a full 90 minutes with us going over all the recommendations we received from the MFMs we've been seeing and formulating a plan for when we conceive. And after many 3 am calls, she's still encouraging us to tall her any time of day or night  if we get a positive pregnancy test.

Anyway, just wanted to tell you that in my experience, not all doctors are the same! There are some really terrible ones and some really wonderful ones out there and it pays to shop around to find someone who you want to work with. I hope you find someone who has the medical skills and the compassion that you need.

Abstract

STUDY QUESTION:
Are non-visualized pregnancy losses (biochemical pregnancy loss and failed pregnancy of unknown location combined) in the reproductive history of women with unexplained recurrent miscarriage (RM) negatively associated with the chance of live birth in a subsequent pregnancy?

SUMMARY ANSWER:
Non-visualized pregnancy losses contribute negatively to the chance for live birth: each non-visualized pregnancy loss confers a relative risk (RR) for live birth of 0.90 (95% CI 0.83; 0.97), equivalent to the RR conferred by each additional clinical miscarriage.

WHAT IS KNOWN ALREADY:
The number of clinical miscarriages prior to referral is an important determinant for live birth in women with RM, whereas the significance of non-visualized pregnancy losses is unknown.

STUDY DESIGN, SIZE, DURATION:
A retrospective cohort study comprising 587 women with RM seen in a tertiary RM unit 2000-2010. Data on the outcome of the first pregnancy after referral were analysed for 499 women.

PARTICIPANTS/MATERIALS, SETTING, METHODS:
The study was conducted in the RM Unit at Rigshospitalet, Copenhagen, Denmark. We included all women with unexplained RM, defined as ‚â•3 consecutive clinical miscarriages or non-visualized pregnancy losses following spontaneous conception or homologous insemination. The category 'non-visualized pregnancy losses' combines biochemical pregnancy loss (positive hCG, no ultrasound performed) and failed PUL (pregnancy of unknown location, positive hCG, but on ultrasound, no pregnancy location established). Demographics were collected, including BMI, age at first pregnancy after referral and outcome of pregnancies prior to referral. Using our own records and records from other Danish hospitals, we verified the outcome of the first pregnancy after referral. For each non-visualized pregnancy loss and miscarriage in the women's reproductive history, the RR for live birth in the first pregnancy after referral was determined by robust Poisson regression analysis, adjusting for risk factors for negative pregnancy outcome.

MAIN RESULTS AND THE ROLE OF CHANCE:
Non-visualized pregnancy losses constituted 37% of reported pregnancies prior to referral among women with RM. Each additional non-visualized pregnancy loss conferred an RR for live birth of 0.90 (95% CI 0.83; 0.97), which was not statistically significantly different from the corresponding RR of 0.87 (95% CI 0.80; 0.94) conferred by each clinical miscarriage. Among women with ‚â•2 clinical miscarriages, a reduced RR for live birth was also shown: 0.82 (95% CI 0.74; 0.92) for each clinical miscarriage and 0.89 (95% CI 0.80; 0.98) for each non-visualized pregnancy loss, respectively. Surgically treated ectopic pregnancies (EPs) were significantly more common for women with primary RM and no confirmed clinical miscarriages, compared with women with primary RM and ‚â•1 clinical miscarriage (22 versus 6%, difference 16% (95% CI 9.1%; 28.7%); RR for ectopic pregnancy was 4.0 (95% CI 1.92; 8.20).

LIMITATIONS, REASONS FOR CAUTION:
RM was defined as ‚â•3 consecutive pregnancy losses before 12 weeks' gestation, and we included only women with unexplained RM after thorough evaluation. It is uncertain whether the findings apply to other definitions of RM and among women with known causes for their miscarriages.

WIDER IMPLICATIONS OF THE FINDINGS:
To our knowledge, this is the first comprehensive investigation of prior non-visualized pregnancy losses and their prognostic significance for live birth in a subsequent pregnancy in women with unexplained RM. We show that a prior non-visualized pregnancy loss has a negative prognostic impact on subsequent live birth and is thus clinically significant.",[],,t1_du8vzpv,False,0,[],False,"<div class=""md""><p><a href=""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24603132"">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24603132</a></p>

[start rant]

The relax advice is really awful. After our sixth miscarriage, our families told us to just 'relax' and that many people have multiple miscarriages, and that it's common.

My wife and I did end up 'relaxing', because we were kind of done. We ended up getting pregnant again a few weeks later. In retrospect, this wasn't surprising -- we get pregnant like every other month, and 'relaxing' or 'not trying, not preventing' for us means miscarrying over and over. Anyway, our family was like 'I told you so', and we were feeling it too when we made it to the second trimester. Of course, you can't actually relax when your issue is recurrent pregnancy loss, and we ended up losing our son in the second trimester instead of the first. While it was unbearable to lose our son, no one in our family has told us to relax anymore, because they realized that if your issue is losing babies, there's no such thing as relaxing. Also, I think they've finally figured out that second trimester miscarriages are quite rare, as are six first trimester ones. Now, they want us to see doctors and figure out what's wrong, and keep pushing us to do so -- so now they're the ones not relaxing. Such awful advice, really

Go with what your gut tells you. Anxiety does not cause miscarriage.

Especially if you are a person who believes in a loving God - that's an awful feeling to think that something you put your faith in deliberately hurt you in this way.

I think maybe it will help you to change the story you tell yourself, so that it stops feeling like something that was *done to you* and starts feeling like it was something that *happened to you.* Don't ask yourself, ""Why was this taken from me?"" Instead, change it to, ""Why did this happen?"" 

Then maybe it won't feel like all your love for children is somehow being used against you. Then maybe it won't feel like God turned away from you or is punishing you for something.

In this paper, CPs are Early Pregnancy Loss, and clinical miscarriages are clinical spontaneous abort!ons, and defined as a clinical pregnancy (made it to at least 6 weeks) but lost before 28 weeks.

The abstract:
OBJECTIVE:
To examine rates of conception and pregnancy loss and their relations with time to clinical pregnancy and reproductive outcomes.

DESIGN:
A prospective observational study.

SETTING:
Population-based cohort in China.

PATIENT(S):
Five hundred eighteen healthy newly married women who intended to conceive. Upon stopping contraception, daily records of vaginal bleeding and daily first-morning urine specimens were obtained for < or =1 year or until a clinical pregnancy was achieved. Daily urinary hCG was assayed to detect early pregnancy loss (EPL).

INTERVENTION(S):
None.

MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE(S):
Conception, pregnancy loss, and time to clinical pregnancy.

RESULT(S):
The conception rate per cycle was 40% over the first 12 months. Of the 618 detectable conceptions, 49 (7.9%) ended in clinical spontaneous abort!on, and 152 (24.6%) in EPL. Early pregnancy loss was detected in 14% of all the cycles without clinically recognized pregnancy, but the frequencies were lower among women with delayed time to clinical pregnancy. Early pregnancy loss in the preceding cycle was associated with increased odds of conception (odds ratio [OR], 2.6; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.8-3.9), clinical pregnancy (OR, 2.0; 95% CI, 1.3-3.0), and EPL (OR, 2.4; 95% CI, 1.4-4.2) but was not associated with spontaneous abort!on, low birth weight, or preterm birth in the subsequent cycle.

CONCLUSION(S):
We demonstrated substantial EPL in the non-clinically pregnant cycles and a positive relation between EPL and subsequent fertility.",[],,t1_du8o9ab,False,0,[],False,"<div class=""md""><p>There&#39;s actually a great chinese study that I don&#39;t know why isn&#39;t cited more, where they looked at a population of women who had never been pregnant before and were trying to conceive, and collected daily urine samples from them so they caught pregnancies very early.

Early losses before 5 weeks absolutely ""count"" as a loss. It's true that they are different from later losses, just as losing a baby at 10 weeks is different from losing a baby at 20 weeks. Since very early losses are more common, doctors will typically need more losses to cross the threshold from  ""maybe just bad luck"" to ""we should look into this.""

>Just wondering what tests are typically done for RPL 

For earlier losses, the focus is typically on things like progesterone, thyroid issues, insulin/sugar issues, structural abnormalities in the uterus, etc. Some doctors will also recommend karyotyping for parents - to see if there are any maternal or paternal chromosomal issues that will increase miscarriage rate.

Some of the hormonal testing, especially for progesterone and estrogen, is typically timed by ovulation (since the results vary enormously depending on where you are in your cycle).

For later losses, there's typically more focus on blood clotting disorders (anti-phosphilipid syndrome, genetic thrombophilias) and less focus on progesterone/estrogen.

What Is Recurrent Pregnancy Loss? 

In 2013, ASRM defined recurrent miscarriage (or recurrent pregnancy loss) as ‚Äúa disease distinct from infertility defined by two or more failed pregnancies.‚Äù They went on to state that, ‚Äúfor the purposes of evaluation and treatment for recurrent pregnancy loss, a pregnancy is defined as a clinical pregnancy documented by ultrasonography and or histopathologic examination.‚Äù1 This updated definition is extremely important for guiding providers for two reasons: first, it decreased the number of miscarriages required for a diagnosis of recurrent pregnancy loss, and second, it clearly defined a clinical miscarriage (distinct from other types of miscarriages). The traditional definition of recurrent pregnancy loss is three or more consecutive miscarriages, and many providers do not initiate testing and evaluation until a patient has had three clinical miscarriages. ACOG has followed ASRM‚Äôs lead and defines RPL as two or more losses,2 but the European societies ESHRE3 and RCOG4 do not recommend testing for causes of RPL until a patient has had at least three consecutive miscarriages. ASRM changed the definition of RPL because the chance of loss after two miscarriages is approximately the same as after three, and some argue that if a cause for miscarriage can be found and addressed after a second loss, then a third miscarriage may be avoided.

Although ASRM‚Äôs definition can justify a provider‚Äôs decision to start testing patients after two miscarriages instead of three, it does not include miscarriages that occur before they can be defined as clinical pregnancy losses (losses that occur after a pregnancy can be documented by ultrasound or tissue diagnosis). A pregnancy that stops developing before anything can be seen on an ultrasound or tested clinically is called a biochemical miscarriage. In these cases, someone can have a positive pregnancy test and delayed menses, but the pregnancy stops developing at an earlier stage than a clinical miscarriage. 

A pregnancy can be detected by either a urine or a blood test ‚Äì both tests are designed to detect beta human chorionic gonadotropin (also known as beta hCG or BhCG), the hormone made by a pregnancy. Home urine pregnancy tests are incredibly sensitive and accurate and can detect BhCG two weeks after ovulation, which is usually four weeks after the start of a period or as early as a week after ovulation in some circumstances. Someone reporting a positive home pregnancy test (urine test) followed by negative pregnancy tests and a period likely had a biochemical miscarriage. In these cases, the egg and sperm fertilized and the resulting embryo implanted and started making BhCG, but the pregnancy stopped developing. 

Biochemical miscarriages do not fit into ASRM or other women‚Äôs health definitions and guidelines for RPL, but my patients struggling to complete their family tell me that each period feels like a loss or missed opportunity, and having positive pregnancy tests adds to the feelings of grief. Until ASRM clarifies what to do with biochemical miscarriages, providers will continue to differ in opinion on whether to initiate testing or treatment for recurrent biochemical miscarriages. Some evidence supports paying attention to these early losses since patients with a history of biochemical miscarriages seem to have a higher risk of more clinical miscarriages and poorer prognosis for fertility.

In this book, I will not distinguish between biochemical and clinical miscarriages, and I will focus on first trimester losses (miscarriages that occur earlier than 13 weeks‚Äô gestation).",[],,t1_du7z4b8,False,0,[],False,"<div class=""md""><p>This is from my RE&#39;s book, &quot;Not Broken&quot;:</p>

<p>In this book, I will not distinguish between biochemical and clinical miscarriages, and I will focus on first trimester losses (miscarriages that occur earlier than 13 weeks‚Äô gestation).</p>

- Thyroid panel (unnecessary really since I have well-managed and medicated hypothyroidism)
- Antiphosopholipid antiboties
- Lupus anticoagulant
- FSH, estradiol, AMH
- Anticardiolipin antibodies
- Beta 2 glycoprotein antibodies
- Karyotyping 
- Saline hysterosonography
- Hysteroscopy (just had one for RPOC so may not do this again)

I'd be happy to talk more with you about this or let you in on my experiences.

If you are looking for a TMFR specific support group, I cannot recommend Ending a Wanted Pregnancy enough (join our Facebook here: https://endingawantedpregnancy.com/private-support-group/). It is the most wonderful, supportive, empowering group of women I know. Some of the women I met through that group, especially those that terminated and joined around when I did, have become some of my dearest friends. We supported each other through the darkest days and have found ourselves on the other side. If you aren't ready for that yet, the website is full of stories that may bring you comfort. 

This will be one of the bleakest things you have ever experienced. Some of the hardest days of your life lie ahead of you. There is no sugar coating it. But there is also no way forward but through. You just have to wake up and go through the motions everyday. One day you will wake up and you won't be sad. One day you will wake up and you will realize that your good moments are outweighing the bad. 

Some things do not get less painful with time, and for many of us, this is one of them. The thing is, though...you will get better at carrying the grief. That is the light at the end of the tunnel. You will always love and miss your baby. It may always hurt. But you will become more adept at managing the pain. 

You will get through this. You will carry some of it forever, and that's okay. It will be proof that your baby is here, right now, and loved. But someday, maybe longer than you like, but someday, the worst of the pain will soften into something different and easier to bear, I promise. 

Please feel free to PM. And I truly hope to see you on the EWP group. No one wants to have to join our club, but since we don't get to choose, there is no better place to learn to chart these stormy waters.

<p>If you are looking for a TMFR specific support group, I cannot recommend Ending a Wanted Pregnancy enough (join our Facebook here: <a href=""https://endingawantedpregnancy.com/private-support-group/"">https://endingawantedpregnancy.com/private-support-group/</a>). It is the most wonderful, supportive, empowering group of women I know. Some of the women I met through that group, especially those that terminated and joined around when I did, have become some of my dearest friends. We supported each other through the darkest days and have found ourselves on the other side. If you aren&#39;t ready for that yet, the website is full of stories that may bring you comfort. </p>

<p>This will be one of the bleakest things you have ever experienced. Some of the hardest days of your life lie ahead of you. There is no sugar coating it. But there is also no way forward but through. You just have to wake up and go through the motions everyday. One day you will wake up and you won&#39;t be sad. One day you will wake up and you will realize that your good moments are outweighing the bad. </p>

<p>Some things do not get less painful with time, and for many of us, this is one of them. The thing is, though...you will get better at carrying the grief. That is the light at the end of the tunnel. You will always love and miss your baby. It may always hurt. But you will become more adept at managing the pain. </p>

<p>You will get through this. You will carry some of it forever, and that&#39;s okay. It will be proof that your baby is here, right now, and loved. But someday, maybe longer than you like, but someday, the worst of the pain will soften into something different and easier to bear, I promise. </p>

<p>Please feel free to PM. And I truly hope to see you on the EWP group. No one wants to have to join our club, but since we don&#39;t get to choose, there is no better place to learn to chart these stormy waters. </p>

First, of course, I am not a doctor and this is not medical advice!

I take 5.2 mg (5,200 mcg) FA per day plus 2 mg (2,000 mcg) methylated folate because of a previous NTD diagnosis. (My MFM advised 4 mg FA to reduce recurrence risk. So I take that, plus there is FA in a few other supplements I use.) Having lived through the nightmare that is TFMR because of a 1/1,150 fatal birth defect, I've personally recommended to friends who are TTC that they take more than the CDC-recommended 400 mcg FA daily. I was taking 800 mcg FA daily (including for more than a year before becoming pregnant) and it seems as though that wasn't enough.

It's a loss, and it's hard to grieve those alone. However, if counseling isn't for you in this case, then may I recommend Share? It's a national infant and child loss group that has local chapters. They meet regularly and do projects together. It's sometimes just nice to know there are others in similar situations nearby.  You can find them on Facebook. The other group I frequent is called The Love & Loss Project. It's fun by a counselor and she gives a lot of resources to help survive during the unknown times. She also runs a companion page called the landing page, both on FB. 

My DH tried the staying busy method too. It bit him hard a few months in, so I can't recommend that to anyone. But, if that's what you need, then I recommend reading or new hobbies.

Both represented hope and dreams, and both felt like a huge part of her. Your loss is no less valid because of the baby&#39;s gestation age. It&#39;s a loss, and it&#39;s hard to grieve those alone. However, if counseling isn&#39;t for you in this case, then may I recommend Share? It&#39;s a national infant and child loss group that has local chapters. They meet regularly and do projects together. It&#39;s sometimes just nice to know there are others in similar situations nearby.  You can find them on Facebook. The other group I frequent is called The Love &amp; Loss Project. It&#39;s fun by a counselor and she gives a lot of resources to help survive during the unknown times. She also runs a companion page called the landing page, both on FB. </p>

<p>My DH tried the staying busy method too. It bit him hard a few months in, so I can&#39;t recommend that to anyone. But, if that&#39;s what you need, then I recommend reading or new hobbies.

<p>But then I moved on. It was my MIL‚Äôs 60th birthday and of course I was in charge of everything. No one other ham my husband and my parents acknowledged what the day was. That hurt a little because all of my in laws knew. But what can you do. </p>

<p>In the end, it was another day. It sucked but it passed. </p>

<p>You are strong and your day will pass as well. Have you given any thought to how you my like to honor your little one? </p>

<p>I&#39;m upset because that cycle we actually tried. Sex a ton during the fertile window. And nothing. Nothing happened. I feel like my body is mocking me. And it hurts. </p>

<p>Of course I know it&#39;s <em>possible</em> we didn&#39;t hit the right day...but I feel like if sperm can last as long as they say...something should have happened. I know it can be hard to conceive and not to get discouraged but I cannot help it. I obsess over things and get so hopeful that when it doesn&#39;t work out I get extremely crushed. </p>

<p>Which has led me to want to stop trying for now. Boyfriend wants a spring baby (the baby we lost would have been born in April), and people in his family don&#39;t have many birthdays between March-May. Although he&#39;s happy with a baby whenever, he wants to actively try around whenever we could possibly get a spring baby. So for now, I think we&#39;re going to go the NTNP route until about May, and then start trying and hope something happens around June-August. I am just not strong enough to be disappointed all the time, and I think there are some things I need to work on with myself in the mean time. </p>

I am so very sorry for the loss of your sweet girls. Your story is similar in many ways to ours - like you, we struggled to get pregnant and, like you, it was due to PCOS and anovulatory cycles. 

It took four years (trying on our own) to conceive the first time. Then our son died at birth when my wife went into preterm labor at 19 weeks. The doctors believe our son died as a result of incompetent cervix. 

After his delivery my wife‚Äôs period came back after about eight weeks. We tried four unsuccessful medicated cycles with the OB and were referred to an RE. While we were waiting for the RE to finalize our treatment plan my wife got pregnant again, a year after the loss of our son. 

For the second pregnancy, my wife had a cerclage (TVC) and was out on progesterone (suppositories) and was able to successfully carry to term. We had a healthy baby boy. 

We‚Äôve been trying again for a few months for another child and no luck so far. So it seems that fertility is definitely still something of an issue, but that we were able to conceive again. Both times my wife got pregnant were after periods of significant weight loss and eating a relatively low carb diet. Second time she was also on metformin. I know both of those things can help women with PCOS better their odds. 
 
Again, I‚Äôm so sorry for your loss. I‚Äôm here for you if you need someone to talk to, want to know more about the loss of our son or our story after that, or share more about your little ones. Hang in there. ‚ù§Ô∏è

I‚Äôll be four weeks out from my ruptured ectopic tomorrow, and I have a bonus 2 other losses before this so our stats are decently similar.

As far as recovery goes, I was able to give up the narcotic level pain pills after about four days and switch to just ice/Tylenol. After about a week I was able to go back to work and I was cleared for some exercise at the two week mark (I waited till 3). Now I don‚Äôt feel pain unless you press on where my stitches were. Are you bleeding yet? My initial bleeding was pretty similar to my first MC (which may have been a CP?)

 We were also cleared to ‚Äúpractice trying‚Äù at 2 weeks but since this pregnancy happened while using condoms we‚Äôre not going to ‚Äúpractice‚Äù until Aunt Flow reappears. I‚Äôm guessing that‚Äôs another 2 weeks out but I have a longer cycle in general so hopefully yours appears faster.

As far as trying again goes, we were told 2 months, but to be safe we‚Äôre going with two cycles. One of the big concerns post ectopic is getting your folate levels back up after the MTX, my doctor let me start taking prenatals again and I‚Äôm also on an iron pill due to the blood loss. 

Being proactive about the things I can change is helping with my mood, the first few days were pretty bleak. It‚Äôs a struggle. Everyone finds comfort in their own way, for me publicly sharing helped (I posted about it on Facebook). For some reason I was also comforted by this being an ectopic.

<p>As far as recovery goes, I was able to give up the narcotic level pain pills after about four days and switch to just ice/Tylenol. After about a week I was able to go back to work and I was cleared for some exercise at the two week mark (I waited till 3). Now I don‚Äôt feel pain unless you press on where my stitches were. Are you bleeding yet? My initial bleeding was pretty similar to my first MC (which may have been a CP?)</p>

<p>We were also cleared to ‚Äúpractice trying‚Äù at 2 weeks but since this pregnancy happened while using condoms we‚Äôre not going to ‚Äúpractice‚Äù until Aunt Flow reappears. I‚Äôm guessing that‚Äôs another 2 weeks out but I have a longer cycle in general so hopefully yours appears faster.</p>

<p>As far as trying again goes, we were told 2 months, but to be safe we‚Äôre going with two cycles. One of the big concerns post ectopic is getting your folate levels back up after the MTX, my doctor let me start taking prenatals again and I‚Äôm also on an iron pill due to the blood loss. </p>

<p>Being proactive about the things I can change is helping with my mood, the first few days were pretty bleak. It‚Äôs a struggle. Everyone finds comfort in their own way, for me publicly sharing helped (I posted about it on Facebook). For some reason I was also comforted by this being an ectopic. Maybe because it‚Äôs a combo breaker? Whatever the case I encourage you to find what works and go that route.

What a heart wrenching loss. The early days are so brutal. How are you holding up?

My husband and I lost our baby boy at 16 weeks in November, our seventh loss after six in the first trimester. My doctor said that it can take a few cycles for fertility to fully return for later losses. One factor that is different in later losses is that prolactin, the hormone that brings in milk for breastfeeding, goes much higher - this is the reason our milk comes in, such a heart break to handle. Elevated prolactin can delay or weaken ovulation, as well as decreasing progesterone in the luteal phase. So, all of that combined can make it more difficult to conceive in the first few months. I have a history of prolactin being slow to decrease (after one of our first  trimester losses), so about 2 months after our recent loss my doctor recommended being retested. My levels were high again, so I was prescribed a medication to help bring it down. I've already noticed a difference in my cycles, though we haven't conceived again.

From a really cold statistical standpoint, conceiving once makes it much more likely that you will conceive again, even you lost the babies to stillbirth. It's definitely not a ""bright side"" to loss and I hate when people say things like ""at least you can get pregnant,"" but I hope it is encouraging for trying again. 

I hope you are able to talk to your doctors soon and get a plan in place for conceiving again and for managing future pregnancies.

I&#39;m also unsure of why my bladder has been going haywire. I feel crazy not knowing what&#39;s happening, like I&#39;m making things up. </p>

<p>Also does anyone else fear that communicating the possibility of a lucky cycle to your SO will jinx it? I&#39;m afraid to tell anyone anything as if saying it out loud will doom it. </p>

My wife and I used to be pretty positive, but it's hard to continue feeling that way given our 'luck'. I think these things do work out eventually, based on everything we've read and been told, but it's a struggle most days. 

We can totally relate to this:

> How do I get past the fact that we seem to always be in the bad end of all of the percentages? 1% of pregnancies are molar, 2% are ectopic... of the ectopic 15% are not able to be fixed with methotrexate

I honestly think the percentages are a total lie. While it's probably true that x% are miscarriages or ectopic or whatever, i think having just one number doesn't indicate whether or not these things happen to the same person over and over again. Like, my wife and I have had 7 miscarriages, which according to the 25% statistic, means we've had enough miscarriages for 28 pregnancies, which means that 28 couples can now have a successful pregnancy without messing up the statistic. Clearly, the numbers are not evenly distributed. It's total crap, and -- in my opinion -- it's completely dismissive when doctors throw these statistics out to make it seem that these things happen to a lot of people. I think it's true that these things happen, but I don't think the number is as high as the numbers make it out to be. Like, going back to the 25% statistic with the other 28 couples... 25% of pregnancies ending in miscarriage does *not* mean that 1 in 4 women miscarry. As my example demonstrates, only 1 in 29 couples can miscarry, and 25% of pregnancies can still end in miscarriage.

One more thing:

> They left the ovary thank goodness although I guess it just chills there in case we ever need eggs from it.

The right tube can actually pick up an egg from the left ovary, although at a much lower rate than a left tube.

For my first pregnancy, I saw a midwife and was then referred to the associated doctor after a missed miscarriage at 10 weeks. I didn't like the doctor at all. The midwives were very kind, but also very hands-off. 

After our loss, I realized that there were a few things that really mattered to me. I wanted a doctor who believed my baby was a baby from the moment of conception and would understand my husband's and my religious beliefs. I also wanted a doctor who would be willing to run tests for common causes of recurrent loss even though I'd only had one miscarriage. Once I knew what I wanted, I started to ask friends and acquaintances who shared my religious/cultural background and had difficult pregnancies - I figured they were more likely to be looking for the same sort of doctor. 

Several people gave me my current doctor's name. We set up an appointment to talk about everything and that went very well. She spent about 45 minutes going over my history, the pregnancy, irregular cycles, etc, and she was very willing to run some basic tests right away. She's been with us through six more losses now, including our most recent in the 2nd trimester and we still love her. We still don't have answers, but every maternal fetal specialist and RE we've seen agrees that we've had all the right tests. We are very impressed by how available she makes herself - I've called her at 3 am more than once, interrupted 4 vacations, and she once had to climb to the top of a hill to get reception while camping to talk to me. After all of that, she still tells us to call anytime when I'm pregnant or miscarrying! 

So, I guess my advice is to figure out what you want in your OB. Are there cultural or religious values that you hope your doctor will have? Do you prefer a particular approach for bedside manner? Would you prefer to see just one doctor or do you like the feel of a clinic with several?

Stopping ibuprofen made my fibroid pain come back with a vengeance. Like nearly crying and not able to really walk pain. It didn‚Äôt get bad until I was already at work. Being in front of students when it crossed into unbearable was *not* how I wanted things to go. As a nice bonus, that was the same class where I got a massive nosebleed on Tuesday. Ughhhh.

I went to MFM for an ultrasound, and the baby is fine. Still moving constantly (she‚Äôs having a dance party as I type this, actually) and looking fine. I moaned and teared up when the tech got anywhere near my fibroid, but they gave me a printout where you can see baby‚Äôs skull from the front. [Fucking metal.](https://i.imgur.com/t7GdgEv.jpg)

Then I went to my OB for an NST to make sure the contractions hadn‚Äôt started again. That was fine, too. They can‚Äôt keep a heart monitor on baby because she just never stops moving. It‚Äôs entertaining and makes for a much less stressful experience for me.

So now I‚Äôm on bedrest and opioids until Sunday night. If the pain doesn‚Äôt stop by then, it‚Äôs another week of this.

For most women with degenerating fibroids, 48 hours on ibuprofen does the trick and the pain subsides. The doctor at MFM and the one I saw at my OB‚Äôs office are both optimistic that it‚Äôll burn itself out and the pain will be over soon (in the next 4 days to one week). If not, I may have to stay on opioids for the rest of my pregnancy and give birth in a different hospital for baby to detox.

 Also, my chemical pregnancies, mixed with my first 10 week loss, were what got my midwife to start checking my progesterone as soon as I get a positive, so that's a bit of a silver lining, as I in fact do have progesterone issues  (1 son I was borderline, 1 son I was low and needed to supplement, and one loss I was low and needed to supplement but had other issues as well) so I get a chance to try to help the pregnancy along thanks to those losses.

Pcos isn't always defined by an ovarian cyst and technically every time we are gearing up to ovulate there is basically a cyst/follicle that is waiting to burst and release an egg, so  during the surgery it may have meant nothing at all.
However, the family history and you having things like the extra hair makes me lean towards pcos as a possibility. Pcos can have several causes including higher testosterone and insulin resistance, so it couldn't hurt to have a little blood work done.

In the past when we were super actively ttc, I drank FertiliTea... I think it was a FairHaven product? Anyway, it wasn't too bad with a little extra peppermint.

That last part is really sweet and sad. But it does put it into perspective; we've been doing this since the beginning of time, grieving and all.

After must loss my midwife mentioned a study in the UK that linked high a1c in men to pregnancy complications and losses. She knows my husband is a type 1 diabetic.

I am currently waiting out a MMC, but its going on 14 days since finding out and 5w since the embryo stopped developing (measuring 6w at 10w) and I have had absolutely no bleeding or anything besides some minor cramping on and off for over a week. It's looking like my next step is either Misoprostol or a d&c and I have been seriously waivering between which I'd rather do. At first I was 100% on the d&c, because waiting for something to happen sucks, AND on top of that it sounds like an absolutely horrible terrifying experience at worst and a pretty miserable experience at best and I'd rather just avoid both. But then I got worried about potential complications, so I started thinking maybe I can handle doing it on my own/medicated if I could control when it would happen and I started leaning towards the medication. But even though I know everyone's experience is completely different, I feel like nearly every woman, maybe 85% or more, who did it at home medicated or not, regrets it and wishes they would have opted for the d&c first. 

My doctor also did not, and still has not, prepared me for this experience at all whatsoever. In fact, they almost didn't even confirm to me that I was having a miscarriage at all! and when I got word in that I didn't know what was going to happen they were just like ""Oh, you're *not* bleeding yet?

I had to demand a meeting with someone to walk me through what is happening, and while she was nice and understanding, she did not give me the option to do the d&c OR the medication upfront, and just told me to keep waiting for it to happen. Still not preparing me for what exactly *would* happen during the active miscarriage, and just saying ""if you fill more than a pad an hour, or feel lightheaded go to the ER."" That was her entire advice. So, in the meantime while I work up the courage to call my OB's office and request a d&c outright, I've been reading and researching stories like yours to prepare myself for any and all possible outcomes of this ordeal.

Each loss is so painful and having so many just compounds it. 

My husband and I have lost at least seven babies in two years - three confirmed losses (I suspect a couple more) between 4 and 5 weeks, three around 8-10 weeks, and our most recent loss at 16 weeks . Our most recent loss was extremely traumatic. One day our baby was perfectly on track for growth and had a beautiful heart beat, less than 24 hours later his heart had stopped. Even my high-risk doctor was shocked. We've had extensive testing, but no answers. I also had a really horrible D&E (anesthesia failure + physical complications afterwards). I'm very afraid of suffering another loss. I'm maybe even more afraid of needing another D&E.

Despite our fears, my husband and I decided to try again very soon after our loss. We really want a living child, so that is a powerful motivator. We also didn't think the fear would improve with time and I think, for me, that waiting for emotional recovery actually makes me focus more on the fear. So I guess our approach is the ""be afraid and do it anyway"" approach.

One thing that helps with ""doing it"" is trying to keep our sex life enjoyable. We chart the sympto-thermal method as well, but we really try to just have regular, enjoyable sex instead of timing it perfectly. It helps that we've both found our libidos improve a little bit around ovulation - nature seems to know we need some help. We're doing a lot medically right now (more testing, taking a bunch of medications, getting even more opinions, etc) and that's hard for me emotionally but we try to compartmentalize that a bit.

The last thing that I find helpful is a weird one. I find it comforting to think about every woman alive before the 1900's who tried to have children and knew that it would probably bring heart break. I watched a documentary a while back on the excavation of a stone age village. Beside the tiny houses, there were often the buried remains of stillborn babies. They were buried with so much care in beautiful baskets, with art and keepsakes. They found other similar baskets without bones and they thought those were likely to be used for earlier losses.

Some women bleed during ovulation. This is not typical, but not abnormal. The hormones that trigger ovulation also cause growth of the uterine lining. After a miscarriage, progesterone is sometimes slow to rise, and it is necessary to stabilize the lining and prevent it from sloughing. Sometimes, this can lead to ovulatory bleeding. This is called breakthrough bleeding, and is not a period. Menstrual bleeding happens after ovulation and the corresponding progesterone spike. From personal experience, we've seen this at least twice during ovulation, and has not impacted fertility for us. From teaching experience, this is one of the most common questions we get. If it is breakthrough bleeding during ovulation you should expect your actual period in a 10-14 days.

That being said... looking at your chart, and given your history of anovulation, another likely explanation could be that your body tried to ovulate but didn't. OPKs measure the amount of luteinizing hormone in the urine. LH in a typical cycle rises just once, and rapidly falls after ovulation. However, in women with a history of anovulation (or sporadically for any one), LH can rise and fall as the body 'attempts' to ovulate but doesn't. Usually you won't see a super strong temperature shift (if any) when this happens, and there isn't a super strong shift in your chart.

I've lost a baby at 16 weeks, three babies at 8 weeks, and several more babies between 4 and 5 weeks. For what it's worth, my husband and I found every loss was heartbreaking. One thing that we find difficult about our earlier losses is that we had so little time to know our babies and there is so little to remember them by.

With our very early losses, there is almost nothing. It's all painful - there's no good time to have your child die.

My husband and I have found naming and remembering our babies healing, though of course nothing takes away the pain of loss. I know some people have a strong gut feeling about their baby's sex and use that to pick a name, while others prefer to choose gender neutral names or to pick a boy's first name and a girl's middle name or vice versa.

<p>I hate that I do this to myself sometimes. The last couple days I&#39;ve been anxious off and on but have gotten through it but today is not one of those days üòî</p>

At first he wanted to stay for a month (which was crazy because we're not even close), but now it shrunk to 5 days (because he bought plane tickets instead of driving a car his parents bought him and pay for).
I'm not jealous because I got the better deal out of it, managing to cut off the toxic narcissistic after years after abuse. 
I'm avoiding having conversations with him because it feels like he always has a point he needs to prove, and I'm tired of his racist, sexist and disrespectful remarks.

Normally you would ovulate and then the corpus luteam would produce progesterone, which stabilizes the lining. Since that isn't happening, the lining isn't very stable and sheds unpredictably.

If it's even lower but still elevated, you will ovulate but it may be delayed compared to a normal cycle. You're also likely to see signs of low progesterone, like a weak temperature shift, short luteal phase, or spotting between ovulation and getting your period.

I can relate. I got pregnant the first time on my second cycle trying. It was a CP. We didn't wait and got pregnant the same cycle, which ended in a MMC at 11 weeks. We did extensive testing and were cleared a couple of months later, though in that time I was also diagnosed with diminished ovarian reserve. I got pregnant the second cycle we resumed trying, but had a MMC at 8 weeks. Given my DOR status we took the summer off to do IVF/freeze all for later (miscarriage was in June, complications through July, IVF in August). We resumed trying in September and every month that I got my period truly felt like the world was ending. By December I was in a horrible place. Christmas was torture. It had only been 4 cycles post MC/IVF at that point, but it had been a year and a half of total time on the calendar, and I was convinced it wouldn't happen and increasingly depressed. We booked IVF for February 2017 and gave it one more try in January. I had resigned myself to calling the clinic on CD1 to start the IVF protocol, but instead called after getting a positive pregnancy test. That pregnancy worked out and I am currently typing this while staring at my adorable almost 4 month old son. 

It's totally normal to feel how you're feeling. It's frustrating. You want a baby and don't have one. It may not have been a long time, but you've gone through a lot in the time you have been trying. I don't have advice for how to feel better, but do know that you're not alone in your thoughts and it's totally OK to not be OK. *hugs*

My husband and I also lost our son in November, though a bit earlier at 16 weeks.

It can be unnerving to not have the reassurance of a normal cycle, but I don't think you should panic or assume you are broken. It takes time to recover physically. The best thing you can do is to take good care of yourself emotionally and physically, which I am sure you are already working hard at.

After your loss, did your doctor confirm that all of the placenta was delivered? Sometimes retained placenta keeps HCG from going to 0, which prevents ovulation. If this were the case, they might suggest another round of misoprostol or another D&C. 

Another thing to ask about is testing prolactin levels. Prolactin goes way up after delivering a baby, in preparation for breastfeeding. I found it so heartbreaking when my milk came in after this loss, but that's prolactin doing it's work. Normally, without our little ones suckling, prolactin levels drop back to normal within a few weeks or months. Unfortunately, some of us find this takes longer than average. This has happened to me twice - after our most recent loss and after our first. The good news is that it was extremely easy to fix. My doctor has prescribed a medication called cabergoline both times (there's another drug called bromocryptine which is also commonly prescribed). It has worked very quickly for me and has gotten my cycles back to normal within a month or so of starting. Normally my doctor has me re-tested for prolactin about 2 months after starting cabergoline and then once we've confirmed it's normal again, I stop taking the medication. Really not a big deal!

A final thing you might ask to check is iron deficiency. Iron deficiency is pretty common in women and pregnancy, miscarriage, and hemorrhaging all increase the risk. If you find you are deficient, it's an easy fix, and if you're not, it might help your peace of mind.

I am so sorry you are going through this. It is such a confusing and anxious place to be. I hope you are able to make an appointment with the MFM or another doctor you trust soon. Definitely get second opinions if you want them. It makes a huge difference to have a doctor you trust and to know you can double check with another doctor as well.",[],,t1_dtp72u2,False,0,[],False,"<div class=""md""><p>I am so sorry for the loss of your son.

My doctor has prescribed a medication called cabergoline both times (there&#39;s another drug called bromocryptine which is also commonly prescribed). It has worked very quickly for me and has gotten my cycles back to normal within a month or so of starting. Normally my doctor has me re-tested for prolactin about 2 months after starting cabergoline and then once we&#39;ve confirmed it&#39;s normal again, I stop taking the medication. Really not a big deal!</p>

<p>A final thing you might ask to check is iron deficiency. Iron deficiency is pretty common in women and pregnancy, miscarriage, and hemorrhaging all increase the risk. If you find you are deficient, it&#39;s an easy fix, and if you&#39;re not, it might help your peace of mind.</p>

<p>I am so sorry you are going through this. It is such a confusing and anxious place to be. I hope you are able to make an appointment with the MFM or another doctor you trust soon. Definitely get second opinions if you want them. It makes a huge difference to have a doctor you trust and to know you can double check with another doctor as well.</p>

They were strong and insane and almost winded me. If I sat down and got up, it would burn and ache. It lasted a day an a half. 

I've had ovulation type pains before (bit of an ache around hip area anywhere from 12-24 hours) and then the next day it's gone. 

My second cycle I do not recall those pains at all. 

This current cycle, however, I had those pains again. although they were not nearly as intense as the first cycle, but right around where I should potentially ovulate. I haven't been tracking mucus though. (And my 3rd period post D&E is expected around the 10th unless t starts early as my second period started about 4 days sooner than it should) 

So here's my timeline:  

D&E Nov 17th. Bled after procedure off and on until around Dec 1-2. 
Intense ovulation like pain Dec 5th-6th. 
Period Dec 18th. 

2nd Cycle - Period started Jan 12th. 

Current cycle - ovulation like pain around Jan 26th? Pain wasn't nearly as intense as first time but it was very much noticeable and more than just a dull ache for about a day. Also hurt if I laid down or applied pressure to the area. 

I don't know if this has helped, but before my D&E I would experience ovulation pain occasionally (did not happen every cycle) on my RIGHT side. These pains now have been on the left side. I haven't been too worried as I was told my periods would probably seem a little different for the first couple/few cycles while my body regulates back out.

With my nearly 4 year old son, I had a unicorn pregnancy and had no concept that things could go wrong, and foolishly told people so so early - i tried to hold out til 12 weeks but by then all family and most friends knew.  Luckily, everything was textbook. 

My most recent pregnancy, things were just off from the beginning.  My husband and I were on the fence about having another and having marital difficulties, so didn't really start to get excited ourselves until about 10 weeks (and about 6 weeks of couples counselling).  We had a few weeks of normalcy and then I started bleeding, which ultimately lead to induction and stillbirth at just over 20 weeks (no explanation).  I finally told people around 18 weeks because I'd had a break in bleeding of about a week and figured things were okay - but even as I posted on FB about it, I had a bad feeling.  My gut was right.  

If I ever decide to try again, I don't think I'll do a FB announcement and will probably just let people know as they see me grow.  Deleting my announcement on FB was one of the harder things about the day of my induction, surprisingly.  I held it together most of the day until that moment and then the floodgates opened. 

In terms of flashbacks, I find my mind wandering to details of the day but not in an intrusive way (note I'm only 3 weeks out).  The social worker I spoke to in the hospital said to reach out to a support line or a therapist specialising in perinatal loss if the thoughts/flashbacks became intrusive, stopped me sleeping, or caused anxiety attacks.  So far nothing like that has happened to me.  I would say if you feel like any of those are the case for you, seek out a therapist or a support line (like SANDS) to speak to.

My husband and I sometimes joke that we will announce our babies births when they turn 18 and we can finally be sure they won't die in childhood :(

Hemoglobin F is [fetal hemoglobin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fetal_hemoglobin#Clinical_significance). This is a type of hemoglobin that is absolutely fantastic at carrying oxygen. Babies make it in utero because they have high oxygen demands, and not very much blood. It's better at binding oxygen than adult hemoglobin, so babies are able to 'steal' oxygen from their mums.

Hemoglobin F crosses the placenta, so it can be used as a marker to detect if a woman was recently pregnant. For example, criminal forensic teams can use it to determine if a woman was pregnant even after giving birth. If you did the test right after losing your baby, then you would expect hemoglobin to be high.

However, there are rare conditions that cause hemoglobin F to be high independent of pregnancy. For example, it is possible you have heriditary persistence of fetal hemoglobin. This causes you to continue producing fetal hemoglobin after the age of six months. If you have otherwise normal blood, this means your hemoglobin is an oxygen super carrier. Fetal hemoglobin is also elevated in certain thalassemias (disorders related to hemoglobin production, which cause anemia). If you have fetal hemoglobin and have inherited sickle cell disease, you may even be asymptomatic -- it's quite the blood wonder.

Was it just hemoglobin F that was high? If so, that's not saying that your hemoglobin is high, that's saying that your percentage of hemoglobin F is high compared to what one would expect (it is undetectable in most adults). This means either that you did the test right after losing your baby, or you have one of these genetic conditions that results in persistently elevated hemoglobin F.

I think there is some reason to believe that persistently high levels of fetal hemoglobin in mothers can lead to IUGR. This is because the mother's and the child's fetal hemoglobin has equal oxygen affinity. I would ask your doctor. I would also ask your doctor for a beta and alpha thalassemia test to discover your status. If you are a carrier for either one, your husband should be assessed as well, to see if your child can inherit certain forms of thalassemia. Certain thalassemias (for example, alpha thalassemia major) will invariably result in stillbirth, unless treated. 


Depending on which alleles you carry, this may influence your care. For example, as far as I'm aware, those with thalassemia minor (carrying one copy of the beta thalassemia trait, or two of alpha) should not be taking any excess iron unless they have been diagnosed as having iron deficiency anemia. Moreover, folate requirements are higher for thalassemic individuals, especially during pregnancy.

Then again, the most likely outcome if the test was done soon after being pregnant is retained fetal hemoglobin from the pregnancy.

Again, so sorry for your loss.

PS.

> Sorry this is so jumbled. Im just scared this means bad news for any future pregnancy.

I know it's hard to believe, but it really shouldn't. Firstly, it is unlikely you have them. Secondly, all these conditions I listed above (thalassemia, heriditary persistence of fetal hemoglobin) are things that are *very* common in some parts of the world. In some parts of Asia and Africa, the prevalence of thalassemia carriers is 60% or more. There is very little chance you have full on thalassemia, since you would know that by now. Persistent fetal hemoglobin can complicate pregnancy, but you can monitor it and I believe they can treat it by blood transfusions. For what it's worth, my family carries both beta thalassemia and alpha thalassemia and heriditary persistence of fetal hemoglobin (I've inherited all of them), and it was not bad news for them. In fact, the persistent fetal hemoglobin would be a protective factor if your child were to inherit the worse forms of thalassemia (which again, would require your husband to have them as well).

<p>Physically, its like my body&#39;s reaction to progesterone went from a 2 to a 10. I get sore boobs almost immediately after I ovulate, and get digestive issues, weird sense of smell, and super tired. It sucks, because it always feels like maybe I&#39;m pregnant, when I know I&#39;m not. Super cruel trick. But I hope in your case it is an impending bpf!</p>

I'm so fragile these days. January was difficult. Moved to a different country with DH. We found a house quite fast, dealt with all the bureaucracy, walked 12k steps a day on average. It was all very fulfilling but hard at the same time because there's nothing stable in our life, there hasn't been for years, and I've grown so tired of it. 

Can't get cosy at the new place because it looks like a building store with all the moving boxes everywhere. Our new furniture will arrive in 2 months, so it has to be us and the boxes until then. 

Today we found out (from a guy measuring things outside our bedroom window while we were in bed at 8 am; who a few minutes later wanted a trip around the house. I barely had time to put some clothes on) that the balconies above us are going to be renovated next month and the workers will need to use our two rooms and garden for the renovation which will take 6 weeks. Now I don't know if I can feel at home here until they're done and out and if I should at all furnish and decorate these rooms until then or not (we will need to move our furniture out of the rooms for them). 

The guy who came to measure things left dirty stains on the floor which annoyed me a lot. Having a clean floor is one of the few things I can afford to distinguish my place from a warehouse. He also stepped on the little plants in the garden that I think might be flowers (daffodils or sth) which was enough to make me cry after he was gone.
 
Not sure if I was crying over the potential of crushed flowers or dead foetuses.

I was in a better place before, and I realise my perception of things is heavily clouded by my emotional fragility. I'm anxious and sad again, and I was in a better place before!

Had unprotected sex with husband on CD 14, had a little brown discharge 6 days later, now lots of white CM (sorry if TMI).

Neither my husband nor I are religious but while waiting in the hospital we were able to spend time, just us, in the chapel. It was a very peaceful place to say our final goodbyes. We had limited privacy once I was in my hospital gown.

Our grief counselor confirmed that naming and conversing with a lost child can be a healthy part of grieving. It's helped us.

We also asked our doctor about donations and were able to give her liver to research on children's blood cancer. It's a comfort to us to know her life is doing good. 

Another thing we used our time for was deciding what to do with her remains. The hospital we went to had a few options. We know where she was laid to rest but haven't felt up to visiting yet. Eventually I think we'll be glad there's a physical spot we can go.

I think you should call your doctor and ask them these questions... what is right for someone else might not be right for you but here are my thoughts:

I had a D&E at 21 weeks and was told to not get pregnant until I'd had two periods (so about three months). My doctor told me it was important to give my uterus time to heal so my womb would be prepared for another baby.

Additionally I checked with my midwife. She said I would probably be fine to start trying after one cycle but there's justification for my doctor's approach.

I'm about a month past my TMFR and still feel easily winded/out of shape and will definitely be waiting the three months but probably more - I want my body (and emotional state) to start from as healthy a point as possible for my next pregnancy. 

Also, even though there's nothing I could have done to help the baby I lost, I still find myself grasping for ways it could have been my fault (that hot bath I took before knowing I was pregnant/irrational stuff like that)... if I were to not follow a doctor's advice and have something go wrong with my next pregnancy it would probably break my heart doubly and make me blame myself.",[],,t1_dtir9dj,False,0,[],False,"<div class=""md""><p>Firstly, I&#39;m so sorry for your loss.

She said that since I have been TTC for more than 6 cycles after my miscarriage and am over the age of 30, she is comfortable going ahead and doing additional fertility testing. I believe that the guidelines suggest a year of TTC for those under 35 before starting the testing, but she accelerates the pace for patients who have experienced a MC. She ordered the following tests:

* A check of progesterone levels on day 21 of my cycle - after confirming that I get positive OPKs around day 15
* An Endosee after my next period - this is a camera that they insert into the uterus and gives more detail than a saline contrast ultrasound
* DH to get a semen analysis 3 days after TTC ends this cycle

She also confirmed that I am taking 200 mg DHA and at least 800 mcg of folic acid. 

We also chatted about my thyroid levels. She would not have treated me for hypothyroid at all and thought that my current TSH levels actually were too *low*. Levothryoxine had brought my TSH down to 0.7, which she said also could be problematic for TTC. We are going to halve my dose of Levothyroxine and see if that stabilizes my TSH a bit. 

Finally, she seemed to think that the changes to my cycle post-miscarriage sounded pretty normal. Apparently, it's typical for AF to get heavier after any pregnancy - even one that ends in miscarriage. That was both reassuring and annoying. It's nice to know that it's not a cause for concern, but having a post-pregnancy body with no baby to show for it isn't great.

It‚Äôs the most excruciating type of pain, but as others have said, the pain gets easier to carry, and the acuteness with which you are feeling it now will not last forever. You have found a wonderful and supportive place here.
