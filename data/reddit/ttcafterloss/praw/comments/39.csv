My son Julian made a dramatic entrance yesterday morning at 36+5. The slightly scary story is below.

As I had said on here, on Tuesday an ultrasound revealed low amniotic fluid and some mild growth restriction, and the OB said it was time to deliver this baby. We did a stress test and thought he'd tolerate induction okay, so they inserted some gel to soften my cervix overnight, which made me extremely crampy. The next morning, though, the OB didn't like the way he was responding to the cramps and didn't think he'd handle labour well, so she made a quick decision to do a c-section. Well, things moved FAST. I got in the room and got the spinal block, the staff were all milling around casually waiting for things to begin, when suddenly the nurse monitoring baby's heart rate yelled for the doctor and my OB pretty much said ""Okay people, we're doing this NOW."" I was shaking and crying because it was all so scary and overwhelming and DH hadn't even come in the room yet, but the anesthesiologist reassured me and said softly, ""Everything is going to be okay. Baby doesn't like what's happening so Dr. W. is going to get him out in about one minute flat."" Sure enough, behind the drape my body was shaken back and forth and I felt some big pressure on my chest and suddenly baby was here! I cried harder because I couldn't see or hear him, but the atmosphere in the room totally relaxed and after a moment I heard a couple squawks and someone said ""Congratulations Mom!"" DH was allowed in the room where, to his utter surprise, he was led to a table to cut the cord and hold his son for the first time. They brought him over to me for about ten minutes--I couldn't hold him myself, but DH held him on my chest and I talked to him and he looked around quietly with super wide eyes. I reached around the drape and he held my finger tight. 

Little one had to go the NICU and will be there for a bit since his blood sugar was crashing and he's going to need some suck/swallow/breathe help. They wheeled my bed through NICU after I left the recovery room so I got to hold him for a few minutes (he'd been skin-to-skin with DH the hour before then) and then I had to spend a few hours recovering in maternity before I could go back down to hold him. We got an hour-long cuddle in (I was VERY weepy!) and then I returned upstairs for the rest of the night--he was on a dextrose IV drip for his blood sugar so didn't need to feed overnight and they told me that honestly, this was the best time for me to get sleep. I did wake up to pump every three hour though--not much happening on that front yet. I'm looking forward to seeing what today brings! I'm feeling okay except my incision site is obviously sore and my abs are tender. I'm hoping Julian is doing okay.

Even though it's not the way I expected or hoped I would deliver, I got my desired outcome, which was an alive baby! Even though I'm sad about being apart from him right now, it does not compare in any way to the anxiety I felt during pregnancy and I'm hopeful we'll all be going home together this weekend. It's been about 15 months since delivering Isaac--thank you all SO much for your support while we grieved, TTC and went through this pregnancy. I honestly don't know how I would have made it through some days without such a loving and reassuring community! I might check in here and there in the days and weeks to come. Hang in there, all of you--the anxiety is the darkest thing I've ever handled but seeing my son for the first time made it all worth it!

I got a carseat and a bassinet at about 26w.  Went on a thrift store shopping spree last weekend at 28w.  Just bought a breast pump today, 28+6.

If at any point baby seems to be in distress, they'll whisk me off for a c-section. I just woke up from an extremely restless night (finally asked for a sleeping pill around 4) and am waiting to find out what happens next.

I can't tell if I mean it or if I'm steeling myself for hurt again. 

I haven't told anyone about this, but it's been worrying me. My husband is a very stoic man. People say he comes off as a little uncaring, but it's more that he's just no nonsense and he doesn't let a lot of people in. The person he projects is quite different to the person he is in public - I love both versions. The night after my D&C I remember saying at the time I couldn't imagine trying again and going through it all for nothing. The misopristol had put me into full labour, and it had reminded me of labour with my living son, which was very difficult. Also I had really bad hyperemesis and had lost 17kgs in the first trimester. So I was just venting about how I couldn't imagine doing it again. 
The next day we were talking and he just totally lost it, broke down in huge sobs, saying he couldn't take it if we never had a baby of our own (my living son is from a previous relationship) and that trying for another baby was a deal breaker. He was saying things like 'I don't want to lose you, but I've just realised how important it is for me to have a child of my own'.
I gave him the benefit of the doubt because I felt like it was not the right time for either of us to make steadfast decisions about it. I reassured him I did want to try again and I was just having a hard time. It's the only time I've ever seen him lose it and it really scared me. 
So over the next few weeks I genuinely did change my mind and wanted to try again. 
But the last week or so I feel so much doubt - of course I want a baby. Deep down there is such a longing for a baby, I can't even tell you why I want one. But having a baby is not easy for me. It's easy for him to say he wants one - he doesn't have to carry it. I have a strange foreboding feeling about my health when I think of trying for another baby, I can't put my finger on what it is. 

I think I'm either genuinely conflicted, or protecting myself from hurt. It took 13 cycles to conceive the baby and I can't try again for up to a year so my age will keep creeping up and that's another thing I worry about.

I am also all new to this. Baby #1 was so easy, I didn't expect to have this much trouble with number 2. This is only my first cycle trying (CP MC in March).

So I just use the Easy@Home ovulation cheapies you get on Amazon. I highly recommend them, so you don't. Low a bunch of money on the digital ones! 

And then I just started using the app Fertility Friend, which I'm pretty sure most people around here use. It's actually pretty neat, it shows you all sorts of things you can check for, including temperature, which is all I do at this point, but also cervical mucus and cervix location (I haven't tracked any of that yet).

So yah, if guess temping is apparently the strongest predictor of actual ovulation. So you should be temping for your whole cycle I think. Fertility Friend puts it in a neat graph for you, and you can actually see the day your temperature spikes, and that means you've ovulated. 

My chart was all over the place this month, because I stated trying again directly after my MC, which my doctor didn't want me to do, lol. But I'm pretty sure I know the day I ovulated. 

So to temp, you should get a Basal Body Thermometer off Amazon, one that measured to the hundredth of a degree (97.44 instead of just 97.4). Then you take your temperature as soon as you wake up in the morning, before you even sit up. Some people to it orally, and some do it vaginally, but as long as you are consistent it should matter. I do vaginally just because sometimes I sleep with my mouth open. 

Sorry this was such a long response, I just know I had TONS of questions when I got here. Let me know if you have any other questions or just want to chat! I'm sorry you're going through this. *hugs*",[],,t1_dg49m0y,0,True,"<div class=""md""><p>It&#39;s okay!</p>

Symptoms, yay!) Today it's gone. Last time before my MC started I also noticed my boobs hurting less and appearing smaller, so there's that. So I thought about going to a nearby clinic to get another ultrasound done - but I had one done yesterday so that seemed a bit too much. Instead, I went in to have my blood drawn to check for hCG, progesterone, prolactin, and estradiol. Either I'll get reassurance or else I'll see if something is wrong. Will probably retest the hCG in three days to see if it doubles. Should have the results later in the afternoon so fingers crossed. 

Also spent the night stressing about OB's visit yesterday (even though it went well). There were a few things that irked me. Like, she asked me the date of my last period and I gave her the exact date and said: ""I'm 6 weeks and 3 days"" to which she replied: ""so, I'll just put 6 weeks here."" I asked her why but I don't remember her answer. I mean fuck, can't you be precise and put exactly the right date? Then she estimated due date as December 4th (and wrote that down)... but my due date (according to FF) is November 30th. I was too surprised to say anything. Like, I know these things don't matter much I guess, except that I don't see a reason why not be precise especially when all the data is available. DH said that she's probably not accustomed to people knowing all the details and thought I was approximating... but still, what the hell. She wrote all this down in this booklet thingy that also has records of all my ultrasounds (I keep that booklet) - well, this morning I changed the due date to November 30th. Ha. I'm the boss of this pregnancy dammit. I might even add: +3 (days) by the ultrasound date. Also, she told me to schedule my next ultrasound at 10 weeks. HA! Lady, if you think I can wait 4 weeks (that's a month!) without any update/news you're nuts. 

UPDATE: Results are in. HCG is 47386! (I will recheck in 3 days to see that it's doubling/almost doubling, but according to my calculations from when I tested before it's on track). Progesterone is 26 which has me worried a bit. I know it's still a good number but... when I tested the first time it was 36 then 33 and now 26 - so it certainly looks like it's going down instead of up.

I wonder if your &quot;low down&quot; crampy feeling is similar to what I&#39;ve been feeling, as baby drops lower and there&#39;s a new sort of pressure in that area. </p>

<p>Any new sensation is definitely freaky, though, especially since I don&#39;t really know what to expect for late pregnancy. When&#39;s your next appointment? Glad to hear baby is active!</p>

It is so devastating to go through what you've been through. I have had three losses all around that time period and each time we told people  close to us. It was sad going through the up up up happy with them, and then the devastating downs. However, I will say this and I've said it a lot on this sub - I do not regret telling people. We got to feel that excitement and it was genuine and happy. I had multiple happy announcements, tears, and smiles and although those announcements did not result in a living baby, the feelings were real. Those close to me were happy. I was happy and excited to share that with them. Because this ended in a loss does not make those feelings any less real or genuine. It does make it sad. It can make it extra sad, I think. I have spent a lot of time thinking about upsetting others, telling them the news, and just felt the world's sadness on my shoulders and the depression from the losses felt compounded almost. So there are pros and cons to telling people. Furthermore, I found that those people that I did not tell about the pregnancies, once I told them about the loss, they were much less supportive. Me saying ""oh FYI I had a/another loss"" usually resulted in ""oh sorry that sucks you can try again"" or ""oh man what the hell?"" Versus those who knew of the pregnancies and then the losses, almost WITH me. After three losses though, we kind of realized that it doesn't make sense to tell everyone super early and bring them on the rollercoaster ride with us, but I think peoples' decisions to tell others is personal and there is no right or wrong way or time. 

I'm rambling, but I just want to say that guilt (while a common and normal feeling for those who have experienced loss) really has no place here. You did NOTHING to cause this and have nothing to feel guilty over, including telling people. Life is full of pain, and loss is so incredibly painful and difficult. Those that you told love you and want to support you - whether you are pregnant or you experience a loss. By telling people when you did, you've hopefully opened yourself up to more support than you may have had if you'd kept mum about it all.

And I know three people who had babies--all sons--in May 2016 and I still have them unfollowed on Facebook because seeing their adorable sons and thinking that my son would have been hitting the same milestones is incredibly tough.</p>

<p>In short, once I passed my due date I think I was more ready to start adapting to my &quot;new normal.&quot; But I know for the rest of my life, it will pop into my head, &quot;He would be walking by now...he&#39;d have said his first words...he&#39;d be starting kindergarten...he&#39;d be in high school.&quot; It&#39;s so unfair. </p>

Joe is doing great.

Breastfeeding is proving to be a challenge because Joe has unusually strong sucking powers (he literally sucks blisters in my nipples) and I have, apparently, pretty sensitive nipples. So at the moment we are expressing milk and finger feeding him. It is a lot of work but hopefully I'll be able to properly feed him later on.

Because for him, it's not just about a healthy baby, it's about me too. We lost our son because of a placental abruption, but I also very nearly bled to death.

Another twanding and I've got follicles and my lining is now measuring 10mm (!!) so everything looks normal, but they don't know why I'm not ovulating since I'm negative for thyroid, PCOS and other rando tests they've done.  

So I'm a good candidate for clomid (yay) but he wants a semen analysis done on the husband and an HSG for me (booooo). 

I wasn't too keen on this but he explained to me that he wants to make sure that my tubes are clear and his sperm are a-ok before proceeding with clomid.  He doesn't want for me to take clomid for a few cycles and nothing happens only to see I've got a blocked tube.  He wants to know beforehand what we are dealing with so I can go into a cycle with clomid knowing if we have any problems before hand. 

Because my first pregnancy was an accident, he doesn't believe we've got an issue between us but wants to double check, which I can appreciate.  I was given Provera so I can end this cycle from hell (it is CD68 today guys, this is some bullshit), and then as soon as CD1 hits, call the office and schedule my HSG.  It has to be between CD5-11 (the HSG).  I am NOT looking forward to the HSG and what is even more annoying is that they only do the HSG on Tuesdays/Thursdays in the morning.  Well, I've got some big projects/presentations due for school (on Tuesdays and Thursdays) so last thing I wanna do is my HSG and then go to school and do a presentation (esp if I have a negative reaction to the dye).  

So my dilemma is whether or not I wait a few days before taking Provera (10mg for 10 days) or if I should just suck it up and start it now.  

The consensus is that I will NOT be pregnant by my due date so I'm upset about that but at least I've got a game plan going and well, it is what it is.  

I'm a bit bitter that I have to endure this but well, what are you gonna do.

I haven't really had the chance to talk to my doctors yet. They just told me to come back in 6 weeks for a follow up. They did mention that if I do get pregnant again I just have to make sure I get cerclage at around 14/15 weeks. 

I just don't want to to be in the daunting and anxiety driven process.  Where I'm waiting to see if and when I'm ovulating. Waiting to see if I'm pregnant. Waiting for an ultra sound. Waiting to hear a heart beat. Waiting to get past the 1st trimester. Now the list gets longer as I had complications. Even talking about this gives me anxiety. 

I think once I feel strong enough I'll reach out to my doctor and see if they have some sort of therapy they can refer me to.

So you're looking at 8 weeks to be potentially told ""genetics looks OK"" or at least 12-16 weeks for ""there are genetic issues and this is what we found""?  I definitely understand your inclination to not wait it out and just try.

What were the recovery times like after each of your losses before you got your period again?  Was it in order of weeks?  Months?  Did you have to schedule a D&C or did you pass the MC naturally/without surgery?  From your OP, it sounds like each of your losses occurred at around 9 weeks.  Putting myself in your position, I think this is how I might wrap my head around how to move forward:

1. If I had to do D&Cs for multiple or all of the losses, I would probably wait until at least finding out the results of this initial genetics test.  If the results point to a genetic problem, I'd continue to wait until after the trip to a genetic counselor.  My understanding is that the more D&Cs you have, the higher the chance of scarring of the uterus.
2. If I had passed all/most of the previous losses naturally, but the recovery time was 2 or more months, I would also wait.  At this point, I would assume that the pattern of losses at 9 months heavily imply that there is *something* going on other than just really terribly bad luck.  I'd rather wait the 16 weeks rather than risk 17+ weeks (9 for pregnancy + 8 or more for recovery) before I can try again.
3. If however the previous losses were all passed naturally and my body recovered within 1 cycle, I would probably be inclined to try again sooner rather than later, and stopping only if the any of the tests come back with tangible results.

So you&#39;re looking at 8 weeks to be potentially told &quot;genetics looks OK&quot; or at least 12-16 weeks for &quot;there are genetic issues and this is what we found&quot;?  I definitely understand your inclination to not wait it out and just try.</p>

<p>What were the recovery times like after each of your losses before you got your period again?  Was it in order of weeks?  Months?  Did you have to schedule a D&amp;C or did you pass the MC naturally/without surgery?  From your OP, it sounds like each of your losses occurred at around 9 weeks.  Putting myself in your position, I think this is how I might wrap my head around how to move forward:</p>

<ol>
<li>If I had to do D&amp;Cs for multiple or all of the losses, I would probably wait until at least finding out the results of this initial genetics test.  If the results point to a genetic problem, I&#39;d continue to wait until after the trip to a genetic counselor.  My understanding is that the more D&amp;Cs you have, the higher the chance of scarring of the uterus.</li>

She found it almost immediately and it was a very happy 150-160. I was so nervous about this part since it was a tense ~5 mins last time trying to find a heartbeat that wasn't there. I was going to beg for an ultrasound if they didn't find one, but no need! Also I REALLY liked this midwife. I've only met 2 so far but I liked her the best. 

Got stuff to do the first trimester screening only because I want another ultrasound, I don't care about the risk of downs at all. I think it looks for something else too but I wasn't really paying attention. Also since I'm a bit overweight (sigh) I  have the option to do the gestational diabetes screen early.

The only definite news so far is still no period.  I did take two more tests, yesterday and this morning.  Yesterday's test came back negative and today's was an even fainter line than on Monday--but I had drank a lot of water before going to bed both nights, and had gotten up to pee in the middle of the night before Tuesday's test... so... maybe those actions could have affected the test results...?

My BBT came down from 98.4 on Monday to 97.7 yesterday, and is 98.03 today.  Also feeling some discomfort on the left side of my abdomen area but it could be due to gas as I've been feeling slight intestinal grumbling.  The aforementioned symptoms all come and go throughout the day.

At this time during my first pregnancy I had taken a digital test which came back positive.  Since I had lost that pregnancy a week later, I'm just going to hold off until next week before taking another digital pregnancy test.  If my period/bleeding comes during that time I won't feel so sad compared to if I got confirmation through a positive digital test had another CP.

I want to thank all of you ladies from the bottom of my hear that responded to my post yesterday. I was in a dark place and to be honest I still am but it made a huge difference. I actually slept last night. I had not idea that so many women were in a similar position to me.

Luckily I had an appointment with my midwife yesterday and she was very sympathetic and went through the most likely scenario with me.

My baby will either be absolutely fine, lethargic or grumpy but severe suffering is highly unlikely. We will probably stay overnight to check on both of us. She also agreed that the risks to my baby were much much lower than if I had stopped my medication.

Yesterday evening, husband and I went to an information event on labor and delivery from the hospital that's 5 minutes by car away from us. There's two hospitals in this city that do deliveries and one in the neighboring city, but we had already agreed on this one unless they turned out to be bad. They have the highest level of NICU, an average of 7 births a day and we really like what they offer. Husband is completely happy that they offer bonding directly after birth and rooming in for parents and baby while I mostly like that they have enough doctors and midwives on staff and can deal with all the types of emergencies. Delayed cord clamping, hearing test etc is all standard. 

I was, however, completely taken aback by most other women there apparently being in their third trimester and based on comments and questions I heard are still deciding on where to deliver. I suppose most of them have low risk pregnancies and don't worry too much about what happens if labor starts way too early? I suppose this is me making a lot of assumptions, but I was feeling rather uncomfortable being only 20 weeks along. 

I was also surprised by how much the ""natural birth"" thing seems to have reached hospitals. They were all ""well, we like doing X, because if reason Y, but if that's not what you want, simply say No"" and talked about epidurals almost apologetically and like an afterthought. 

Writing articles novel today, sorry... I'm also debating on begging my gynecologist for a 'Beschäftigungsverbot' at Monday's appointment (anatomy scan). That's a German thing where she writes a letter to my employer and health insurance saying that I am not allowed to work anymore because working will impact my or the baby's health negatively. From that point, health insurance would take over paying my wages instead of my employer. I can't work as a software developer with untreated arthritis in my hands and worrying about that is completely messing up my already unstable mental health.

<p>I progressed from 5 to 9,5 cm in 5 hours and pushed Joe out in one hour. I didn&#39;t tear or require stitches and all the midwifes and nurses were so impressed! </p>

<p>We were home five hours after birth and doing great. </p>

(and before someone considers me irresponsible here - I hope not! - while Effexor withdrawal is said to be worse than that of the other drugs, it's usually over within hours and requires no medical intervention) 

But I get it. I get the feelings of doing something wrong, of being selfish because I can't cope without drugs. I get feeling like maybe I shouldn't have a biological child in the first place because my health shit could mean him having disadvantages or inheriting it.

<p>But I get it. I get the feelings of doing something wrong, of being selfish because I can&#39;t cope without drugs. I get feeling like maybe I shouldn&#39;t have a biological child in the first place because my health shit could mean him having disadvantages or inheriting it. No need for shitty people to throw around things like being &quot;grossly irresponsible&quot;. And yes, that&#39;s a shitty person who said that. </p>

<p>I do whatever feels right. If staying in bed feels right, then I do that. If crying feels right, then I cry. If painting feels right, then I paint. If visiting family feels right, then I visit family. If synagogue feels right, then I go to synagogue. </p>

I went really crazy TTC after and thought (really thought!) I was magically going to be pregnant again right away. I was definitely obsessed with TTC, and that helped in the short term, but each month when AF showed up all of that pain and sadness rushed back in. Then last month I went on spring break with my family and something happened. Getting everything planned for it kept my mind focused. Being on vacation let me stay busy, have fun, and not really think about the loss. When I came back I felt different, and still feel different. Somehow that lifted me back up. So, grief definitely consumed me. Then while being gone I just became satisfied with how things are. I actually came back here to unsubscribe since with this satisfaction also came the reality that I am 42 and yeah, odds are way out of my favor. I wish you luck with healing. You always feel that sadness, no matter what, but if you can find a way to recognize that your life is still very good, and that you can still have a lot of fun, then you can come to peace with it.</p>

Going to ask my doc this week about pelvic floor strengthening exercises. My core was not super strong to begin with so I'm a little concerned I'll end up with some issues if I don't step things up. My exercise routine while pregnant has been sporadic, some walking and yoga and a couple sessions of light weight lifting, but nothing routine. Attempting to do better.

I prefer online shopping but dealing with returns is a pain, definitely hard to predict fit with the bump and weight gain that seems to be mostly on my hips. Lol my whiney #firstworldproblems. 

Also, my puppy has kennel cough I think even though she was vaccinated for it :( poor thing. Taking her to the vet today. DH is away all week so I'll be on puppy nurse duty solo.

(source: am a CBT therapist:) Usually, I also start with getting people to identify their automatic negative thoughts. That term (automatic negative thoughts) - did your psychologist explain that? Automatic thoughts aren't the same as ruminating thoughts. Because they happen automatically most people aren't aware of them and it takes time and practice to be able to identify them. But let's say you are aware of them, then there are a bunch of cognitive (written) exercises to do in sessions on those thoughts - go one by one and dissect those thoughts. Your current therapist might want you to keep a diary so that next session she/he can pick one of these thoughts and start with the cognitive exercises. Another use for keeping a diary is to be able to notice patterns you might not otherwise be aware of. 

The rumination scheduling is a common CBT technique although usually given a bit later in therapy because indeed.. it's not that easy to do. Say you put the rumination time 5-6pm or.. 10am-11am and 6-7pm (whatever); If you do practice it today and tomorrow and every day after that... then probably within a week your brain will get the message and will begin automatically to 'worry' around 5-6pm, or 10am-11am and 6-7pm. The whole idea of CBT is to sort of reprogram your mind.. but it takes time and perhaps your therapist is moving a bit quickly? My advice is to do the homework and next session mention everything you wrote here to the therapist. 

Finally, every therapist is different, but usually the first session (regardless of whether its CBT, psychodynamic, etc) is more of an intake than therapy. You get asked to talk about yourself, about your problems, yourself, your life, your work, your family, your childhood.. Just curious if your psychologist did that too?

So when I don't gain I feel like I'm starving the poor child and when I gain I feel like I'm getting fat and will never lose the pregnancy weight etc. My therapist says I should just stop weighing myself, my husband says I really should worry about other things...

My son Riyad died at 38 weeks, this past November. Please know that this is NOT your fault. This was completely out of your control. My story is similar to yours, I had a great 38 week appointment with a midwife, we heard my son's heartbeat, and all was well. The next day I didn't feel much movement, but I thought he was having a lazy day because I had just been at the OB's office and he was kicking the day before. I let a day pass and decided to check on him the next morning, because I started to get worried. And there was no heartbeat. I too thought we were in the clear, and I have never heard of anyone having a stillbirth before, let alone one in the third trimester. I thought that wasn't possible and people's issues were either genetic, or that they had babies too early, as preemies. Stillbirth for reasons that were not genetic, never crossed my mind...even umbilical cord accidents, I thought they just wouldn't happen to me, because my pregnancy and baby were always deemed perfect. We never, ever expect it to happen to us. And why should we? It's not logical, it's not rational, it's not fair. 

I am so sorry for the loss of your precious Natalie. I bet she was beautiful. Please don't feel guilty. It's hard to not feel like you failed, I still struggle with it a lot, but knowing that this situation was out of your control, and you had no prior knowledge that anything was wrong with Natalie or endangering her, helps. Hindsight is your biggest enemy here. You can't apply what you learned after your daughter's stillbirth and think that you knew she was in distress, when you didn't. There was no possible way for you to know she was in distress at the time, especially after a great checkup. There was no reliable sign that her life was in danger. Riyad had lazy days when he was at 7 months gestation, sometimes we were traveling and he would kick way less, and I would worry but the next day he would be back to normal. So we really can't know when and if our babies are in danger...at least not more than a doctor would know. I know you have trouble believing that there was nothing you could have done, because you're the mom! I feel the same way. I was Riyad's mom, I should have known he was in distress, I should have magically deduced he needed help and saved him, because he was in my womb. No matter how much the doctors tell me his death was so fast, and had no warning signs, no matter how many perfect appointments I had that would never ring any alarm bells or put me on edge, I still won't believe it. And I don't think that will really change. But I have to learn to live with it, and I have for the most part, accepting the fact that it WAS a freak accident, out of my control, even though I still blame myself. It's because we're moms. It's not rational, or fair to blame ourselves, at all. We went through more pain than anyone else has, so why continue to add additional pain on top of that? But we're the mothers, and sometimes grief is irrational.

I didn't really get an answer after my autopsy report, either. They found a blood clot in the placenta, which could have led to his death, or it could have formed after he died. I had a lot of blood when my water broke after his death, so they think it's a Placental Abruption that took him--but they can't be 100% sure. My OB was inbetween labeling it an Abruption and just labeling it a cord accident. I, too, had multiple blood tests that came back negative for clotting. Basically everything was normal, even the clot in the placenta wasn't so huge that it was ""abnormal."" Baby was normal, too. 
I wish after every stillbirth, doctors found our babies wrapped head to toe in the umbilical cord, just so there was a clear answer as to why. I am still searching for the why behind my son's death, but I don't think I'll ever find it. It's another grief mechanism I use, and I think you will keep searching for answers, too. Because none of this makes sense, and so many stillbirths are unexplained, happening to perfectly healthy, normal pregnancies. 

Are you doing anything special to remember Natalie? Maybe you can do a balloon release on her due date, with pink balloons. I've heard that's very therapeutic. Or spend some time with your husband, just remembering her together, and relax together.

After all why wouldn't you have anticipated it? It sounds like you were pretty far in your pregnancy and comfortable. I know how you feel. I lost my son 10 days before his due date and we had the nursery ready, I had piles of baby things that are just sitting in a cabinet right now, and we had SO many plans for him and ourselves. 

I also know how you feel about the TTC dilemma. It took me a bit longer than you to get pregnant, about six cycles, but my approach was very relaxed and I didn't really track or anything. We were more of the ""when it happens it will happen"" approach because we figured we have time to get pregnant and when we did, we certainly weren't envisioning losing the baby. Have you thought of maybe taking a month or two off? I was forced to take three months off by my doctor before conceiving because my loss was the equivalent to a full term birth, so I needed time for my cycle to regulate and it's just regulating now at almost 5 months. 

But I'm thinking if you wanted to WTT for maybe at least a month you can address your grief, relax, spend time together with your husband not thinking of TTC and stressing out. It does cause a lot of stress, although I so badly want to get pregnant again and I know you do, too. Like, can't we just move on from this phase quickly and go on to have the families we were supposed to have? But I think you can still have a great summer and lose weight. I just got my period so I figured this month while simultaneously ttc I can keep up exercise, nothing super intense but consistent, because I know losing weight makes me feel better and also improves fertility. You can find some kind of balance....maybe you can get more exercise in, go on date nights with your husband, really take a few weeks off to enjoy life and chill? If you have much time on your hands now maybe you two can go on a mini vacation together and reconnect! I know the very few times in the day where I DONT feel desperate to conceive and have a baby after my loss, and I focus on things I enjoy and that make me feel good, I feel sooooo much better. It's like giving my mind a break from grieving and worrying about the future and getting pregnant again. It's so so necessary to have some relaxing times in between all of this stress. You deserve that! You deserve a little time off for you and your husband, and for yourself ❤ 

And, if you can find some sort of balance, where maybe the coming month you started to track your cycle and BBT but didn't put too much pressure on yourself to get pregnant now, and filled the in between time with fun hobbies, self care, pampering...that would be good, too!

There will always be a tug at my heart with doubt and sadness. But I love our daughter so much. I love my husband so much. I can love more. </p>

<p>Anyway, that&#39;s rambling. Our new cats, Bev and Jellybean are doing great. They are so wonderful and really make the house a home. <a href=""http://imgur.com/nSq22FG"">http://imgur.com/nSq22FG</a></p>

<p>Question about movement.... I think I have kind of a lazy baby. I thought the movement would be getting stronger and more often by now, but honestly I don&#39;t think it&#39;s really changed much since around 20 weeks. I mostly feel her at night and in the morning, and here and there during the day, but most of the time nothing. I know I don&#39;t have an anterior placenta either so it&#39;s not that. Her movements are still low below my belly button too. Is that weird? I haven&#39;t had a single rib kick yet and I feel like I read about that happening all the time. Ugh, need a window to see in there or something!</p>

We made an appointment for the 10th when I'll be 7 weeks, and when I asked what to do if in the meantime something like bleeding happens, she said to call her immediately and gave me her cell phone number. I keep looking at the calendar thinking: if I just get over April and just the first few weeks of May - I'll enter the second trimester! But I also remembered the feeling of hopelessness when the bleeding started last time and it's just so overwhelmingly sad.

I asked her about the thyroid too. She didn't seem concerned when I said it was 2.2 but honestly she didn't sound like she knew much about it. 

So, this morning I went for another blood work to test TSH, FT3 and FT4. Apparently, the TSH is highest in the morning on empty stomach (yesterday I did it later on and after breakfast). If the results are higher today, I will probably go to a GP and ask for a low dose levothyroxine. Thank you u/MalikaCadash for lots of useful info yesterday about thyroid issues!

**EDIT**: Holy shit, guys! So my results from this morning are in, TSH 4.2 uIU/ml!!!  Definitely different from yesterday. FT4 is 16.4 pmol/l and FT3 is 4.9 pmol/l. Those seem within the range (from what I could find online, which isn't much) but definitely on the high spectrum. When I saw the results I jumped up, put a coat on, and run out to a GP, asked for a levothyroxine prescription and got it (50mcg). He insisted I should speak to my OB first... so I might do it, although the guidelines are pretty clear that one should take thyroxine. Now the only question is: should I take one pill now and the next one tomorrow morning or just start tomorrow morning. Any experience with this ladies?

My first baby was supposed to be born in September. My SIL was due with her second in October. I lost my pregnancy at 20/21 weeks. She got to continue hers. Just... so unfair. She gets two perfect pregnancies, and babies. How was I supposed to face her, and then her baby who was going to be just a month apart from mine? How would I do thanksgiving and christmas? 

I did it because what else was i going to do? I do wish I had taken the advice I am about to give you, which is: step back. We went to mothers day the week after my loss with her and her big belly. This year I need to opt out, because, even though we thought it'd be fine, it wasn't. Now the idea of that day again is traumatizing. We went on our yearly vacation with her in august and it was so much harder than I thought. This year I need to opt out of it because I didn't opt out last year, and now I feel traumatized by it. By Thanksgiving and Christmas I was able to handle these events better (my nephew being born for these) and it was still hard. I cried but had learned how to navigate my own emotions better by these events. it took 5, 6 months though. that is my timeline, yours may be shorter or longer. But if you feel you are not 100% ready for some stuff, OPT OUT. Take care  of you!

The day my nephew was born, I cried. My husband didn't understand, he'd healed better than I. People here understood. Come to us for these confusing emotions, like having the best day and worst day be the same day. 

I love my nephew very much. He is not the baby I lost, he is a different baby. A lot of the fears I had ended up not being the case. That said, I did unfollow my SIL quietly on social media, because I need to be in charge of when I see him, not be subject to the whim of a instagram feed. I don't think she even noticed, but it took a ton of pain off me. 

I can't remember your timeline, but it sounds like your loss is recent from your math. You will learn how to navigate this stuff. But I don't even think you navigate it at this point. I think you steer clear of these waters all together.

I completely understand how you feel. My Riyad was supposed to be the first grandson of the family, and once my sister gets pregnant, which I have a feeling she is trying to, if it's a boy I will have a meltdown. My sister is a very jealous person and didn't want me to have a boy, in fact she was obsessed with what the gender of my child would be. And it's ironic because he's dead now, so I harbor a lot of resentment toward her jealousy of my pregnancy and the fact I was going to have a living son. 
My sister in law is pregnant too, I found out this last week on Friday, I was a complete wreck for a couple days. I am worried she will have a boy and it will feel so unfair for me, too. 
I hate holidays and gatherings now! My husband's niece was pregnant the same time as me, and she has an almost 8 month old daughter now, and when people played with her IN MY FACE at Thanksgiving and Christmas, I wanted to shrivel up and die. It's annoying. There's too many babies around us, when all we want to do is be left alone, and NOT be reminded of our lost babies sometimes, and the cruel joke life played on us by taking them away from us at the very last minute. 

Anyway, I just want to let you know that I know how you feel, I sympathize with you on all of this. My heart aches when I see baby boys, too. You're not alone in this terrible situation. And sometimes I feel very alone in my situation, too. All of these babies keep sprouting up all around me, and I'm alone thinking of Riyad, my baby who should have been here, and missing him. 

BUT I have thought of certain things to make me feel better: lately I've been reminding myself that any baby I see ""isn't my baby."" It's an obvious statement, but I have to reinforce it. Every woman has a different story. There's people close to me that are ridiculously, stupidly lucky who have never had any losses and just keep popping out babies, but there are other moms whose babies we see whose stories we don't know. They might have had stillbirths like us, many miscarriages, a history of infertility. We just don't know. 

Also, please take care of yourself and be patient with yourself. It's okay to want to avoid an event because you're going to be surrounded by babies. IF you feel like you can go to it, or you're up for seeing everyone else and think you would be fine avoiding the babies ,then that's good. But if you feel like there's no way and you don't want to see anything child related, then by all means, skip. Put yourself first. 

I think people mistake me for being okay all the time. I'm a naturally happy person, so no matter how much I grieve inwardly and cry half of the day in the bathroom and feel like a wreck, I just always seem ""okay"" in front of others. I hate it, that's why I'm so glad for groups like this and other loss moms I personally know, who get it and know that you aren't just ""okay"" because you're not screaming and wailing tears in public.

1. I totally get that juxtaposition of not wanting people to see you in pain but also not wanting people to think you've moved on. When around a bunch of friends or family I feel like screaming, ""my baby died... I'm NOT ok.  Don't let my fake smiles and laughs fool you.""  So far I have been able to hold that back - can't guarantee that will hold forever (joking and sarcasm are my friends too)

2. I have skipped countless events since we lost our daughter (stillbirth due to incompetent cervix) last October. At times I feel guilty but then I remind myself that I need to do what I've got to do to make it through each day. My new motto is that I don't do things I don't want to do. Period.

<ol>
<li><p>I totally get that juxtaposition of not wanting people to see you in pain but also not wanting people to think you&#39;ve moved on. When around a bunch of friends or family I feel like screaming, &quot;my baby died... I&#39;m NOT ok.  Don&#39;t let my fake smiles and laughs fool you.&quot;  So far I have been able to hold that back - can&#39;t guarantee that will hold forever (joking and sarcasm are my friends too)</p></li>
<li><p>I have skipped countless events since we lost our daughter (stillbirth due to incompetent cervix) last October. At times I feel guilty but then I remind myself that I need to do what I&#39;ve got to do to make it through each day. My new motto is that I don&#39;t do things I don&#39;t want to do. Period.

I had my first MC at 11 weeks this past October, then one at 5 weeks in March. The first one turned my life upside down and was very traumatic physically and emotionally. The second one I almost expected to happen, I was spotting the entire time. It was awful, don't get me wrong, but not as jarring as the first one. 

In terms of testing, I got fed up with my OB's way-too-casual approach to MCs. Like I didn't even get a call back from a doctor, she had the receptionist pass along a message to come in in a week or two. Umm, no. I just met with a new practice last week, and while the new doctor spent a ton of time with me, I had to insist on some preliminary blood work (progesterone and prolactin). She was willing to do it since I was forcing the issue, but her strong clinical recommendation was to try again and reassess based on how that pregnancy progresses. It's so puzzling to me how doctors approach similar situations in such different ways.

After my first loss, we felt that we needed several months to clear our heads and feel ready to try again. After this second loss, we don't feel that way at all and want to start trying immediately. 

Despite two consecutive losses, I do feel optimistic. Statistics rarely comfort me in the way they do most people, but it does make me feel good to know that the odds are great that the next pregnancy will be a healthy one. And if it isn't, my doctor will take testing much more seriously. For that reason, I think I'm going to bypass the two tests I forced her to prescribe (since I'll have to wait additional cycles to test at the right time and wait for results) and go for it again. 

Something else I did differently after the second loss was to only tell people who were supportive the first time. I was deeply hurt by those who are close to me who didn't even acknowledge my loss.

I could tell she'd really read my chart from front to back before my appointment, which I appreciated SO much--the thing I hate about meeting new doctors and nurses is having to go through my history all over again. We're going to do another ultrasound in the next week or two, mostly for my peace of mind, and I'll see her again at about 37.5 weeks. She said there's probably no need to do an early induction unless something goes awry or I'm truly going insane, but we could maybe do an induction at term if it will help my anxiety. I'm okay with that; I honestly am looking forward to hopefully a couple of restful weeks of maternity leave before baby comes (my last day at work is the 13th, which is three weeks before my due date). I know the anxiety won't go away until I hear a crying baby. Feeling so lucky to have such great prenatal care. The attitude of both the OB and my family doctor is that everything is most likely going to turn out just fine, but there's no harm in monitoring things closely, especially if it helps me feel calm.

In other news, after that appointment I did some more baby shopping.

I don't know anyone in my life who's had one loss, let alone two. I feel like there's something wrong with me because so many of my friends have oops babies that turn out fine, but I'm trying my hardest and it isn't working out very well. This helps me feel less alone. 

Does it feel different?: I've had two losses back to back. One in December 2016, one in March 2017. It feels so different trying for a third time. I'm not excited at all and I have a feeling a positive test will fill me with dread rather than excitement. As someone else said, it's like ""Oh good, when will I loose this one?"". 

Are you seeing an RE?: I'm seeing an OB who specializes in infertility (I have PCOS) but I feel like I'm reaching the end with him. Repeated losses, femara isn't working as well for me anymore. So many wonderful things... I live in a small area so I'd see an RE if there was one, but the nearest one is 1.5 hours away. On top of that, I'd have to pay for all my monitoring as my health care covers everything billed under OBGYN. 

Did you do testing?: Yes, I did the RLP and everything came back fine. I can't tell if this is comforting or not. On one hand, if something was wrong then it could be fixed. On the other hand, nothing is wrong and I had bad luck. Then again, maybe what's wrong with me just wasn't found on the tests they ran. 

Do you feel optimistic?: My lack of optimism has less to do with miscarriages and more to do with not responding to femara. I was extraordinarily fortunate that I got pregnant the first times that I tried (once I was prescribed femara). So as long as I ovulate I seem to be able to get pregnant okay. However, now I'm not ovulating with meds and everything is really uncertain. So I'd say no, I don't feel optimistic.

Thank you to everyone here who shared their stories.

Btw, did you ever experience feeling cold in the first trimester? I have these moments of feeling super hot (when I'm at home usually) but whenever I go outside, or there's a breeze coming from the window, I start feeling very cold.


EDIT: Got my results: 

TSH: 2.2  - that's really close to the maximum number right? I might redo this test sometime soon.

hCG: 2594! So... I started with 61 last Wednesday, 177 last Friday, and now... 2549 Wednesday.. That is more than double, and possibly more than triple. I need to try to figure it out. All I know is that if it had just doubled over 48hours I'd be at 1062. I am thrilled that it's going in the right direction, just hoping it's not going there too fast! Just checked, and it seems like hcg is doubling every 30 hours which is totally normal! Weeeee! :)

We also started trying in June 2016, got pregnant in August when I started to temp and OPK, and lost her in November. Then got pregnant again in Feb our first month trying again and lost that one in early March. 

I imagine we will go back to TTC next month but we will be away over my projected FW so I doubt I will temp, and I'll pick back up in May to go full throttle again. I am out of OPKs and don't think I'll buy any more, my cycles are fairly regular and I'm burnt out from doing all of the things.

I have an appt with my OB on Friday so my plans may change. I'm really hoping she will do some preliminary testing (progesterone since I'll be 7dpo, thyroid, not sure what else) and I have a feeling she will tell me to wait 2 cycles but I don't think we will since this was an earlier loss. She'd need a pretty convincing reason to get me to wait lol. 

We also have a referral to a fertility clinic but I don't think we will get in until end of May at earliest, and at this point don't plan to hold off on TTC while we wait to get in.  

I feel optimistic that I'll get pregnant again but my optimism about staying pregnant is waning. I honestly don't think I will keep TTC if we have a 3rd loss so I am really hoping the next one sticks. :( I don't really like the person this struggle has turned me into - weight gain, sadness and demotivation, and I don't like how I've put so much on hold in the case that I get pregnant. I really don't want the next however many years to be this way, so will have some big decisions to make should we have another loss.

Does it feel different? - Very much so. The first loss was bad enough - traumatic many months of bleeding after my D&C, derailing of my PhD progress, confusion, loss of innocence/naivety. The second loss was total devastation, disillusionment, and this global feeling that I had lost any sense of control over my life (beyond fertility). The total time makes it harder.

I know that feeling - but pretty sure you'll recognize me, and I am nulliparous as ever! I am over in r/infertility more often these days as time passes and our progress is marked more by moving along the continuum of infertility treatments than realistically expecting to conceive on our own any time soon. 

I'm very sorry to hear that you have been struggling during this time. I am pretty selective about social media also, and I think it is a good thing that you were mindful about adding different platforms back into your life. Best to know where you want to engage and why rather than just jumping in. And ya know, Facebook probably is not the place for what you are feeling - but this place is. We certainly share brighter moments, but the reality of this group is that pain, loss, and hurt are what we ALL have in common - I for one am totally fluent in snark, sarcasm, dark humor, and full-blown Bitter Betty colloquialisms. Bring it - the dark corners of life do not put me off.

About the recurrent loss testing - this armchair fertility (non)expert disagrees with your OB. There's two things I don't know about you, and that you don't need to tell me, but to keep in mind - your age and when you first started trying to conceive. If you are under 35 and it has been 12 months since the day you started trying to conceive (or 6 months if you're in my 35+ crew), it's a good idea to start seeing an RE. Every month since that very first month you started TTC without conceiving a pregnancy the resulted in a live birth counts towards the total months - when you were pregnant, the time to miscarry, the time to recover - all of it. Since you have had two losses in the 2016 calendar year, I'm guessing you are at least getting close to a 12 month total windown. Next - the American College of Obstetrics and Gynecology recently revised the definition of recurrent pregnancy loss from three to two - so your OB has not adjusted. Additionally, I would not want to even do a recurrent loss panel with my OB - I love her, she will be wonderful when I am having a more successful pregnancy, but OBs are not specialists in fertility and loss issues.

But apparently, not having that release in my life has caused a pretty bad negativity spiral. 

So, in the last few months of my TTC life:
- I am officially in the 2nd full post-MC cycle after my 3rd MC. First cycle I had no signs of O. My OB is pretty adamant that he won't support recurrent loss testing unless I go through at least 1 more loss, so I want to switch practices if I do end up with another BFP (for those who don't know, my first loss was over a decade ago and with a different father - it was an accidental teenage pregnancy, so he doesn't count it towards the ""standard 3 losses before testing"").

- I now seem to have developed longer cycles. I'm getting positive OPK's on CD19 (which is also today), and my last cycle was 34 days. It's not ideal, but I can live with cycles that are basically a week longer than before. Particularly if they stay as regular as they were before TTC.

- I'm struggling with being off my medications. I've been off them for over a year now (first because of TTC, then pregnancy, then TTC then pregnancy again and now TTC again). I'm facing the very real possibility of needing to go back on them and stop TTC for a while until I stabilize again because it just gets so dark up here. I don't really want to tinker with the ""types"" of meds I was on, because it just sets off these terrifying chain reactions but I know I can't stay off them much longer without some very scary stuff going on in my head.

Other than that, I'm expecting to spend a while reading through the threads and catching up.

So your progesterone of 19 in your healthy pregnancy was still okay, and possibly it was on a down-swing from a previous high pulse.  Also, if you had supplementation via suppositories, those don't really enter your bloodstream and won't be reflected in your progesterone levels. 

That said, there are very few risks associated with progesterone supplementation (there is a slight risk of a urinary issue for male fetuses, but I think that's it), so it makes sense that some doctors are willing to supplement.  My old RE did not believe in progesterone supplementation.  For me, my progesterone with a healthy pregnancy was 20, then increased to 22 (we didn't test further; I lost that baby at 20 weeks to a cord issue).  For my two subsequent losses last year, progesterone started at 20 and 18, respectively, and then dropped from there.  It was a sign of a failing pregnancy in both cases, and I don't think progesterone would have saved either one. 

This time, I had a frozen embryo transfer of a PGS embryo (well, two of them, but only one implanted).  It was a natural FET, so I had a corpus luteum producing progesterone and I was also taking progesterone in oil.  My progesterone at 10 days post transfer (so 15dpo) was 16. Not a good sign. My betas also slowed down, so they upped my progesterone in oil to a higher level. 4 days later, I think my progesterone was in the high 20s, but I can't remember anymore. My embryo has been measuring behind at ultrasounds, so who knows what's going to happen. That low progesterone level definitely worries me.
",[],,t1_dfire12,0,False,"<div class=""md""><p>The thing about progesterone is that it pulses throughout the day, and is affected by things like eating. So your progesterone of 19 in your healthy pregnancy was still okay, and possibly it was on a down-swing from a previous high pulse.  Also, if you had supplementation via suppositories, those don&#39;t really enter your bloodstream and won&#39;t be reflected in your progesterone levels. </p>

<p>That said, there are very few risks associated with progesterone supplementation (there is a slight risk of a urinary issue for male fetuses, but I think that&#39;s it), so it makes sense that some doctors are willing to supplement.  My old RE did not believe in progesterone supplementation.  For me, my progesterone with a healthy pregnancy was 20, then increased to 22 (we didn&#39;t test further; I lost that baby at 20 weeks to a cord issue).  For my two subsequent losses last year, progesterone started at 20 and 18, respectively, and then dropped from there.  It was a sign of a failing pregnancy in both cases, and I don&#39;t think progesterone would have saved either one. </p>

<p>This time, I had a frozen embryo transfer of a PGS embryo (well, two of them, but only one implanted).  It was a natural FET, so I had a corpus luteum producing progesterone and I was also taking progesterone in oil.  My progesterone at 10 days post transfer (so 15dpo) was 16. Not a good sign. My betas also slowed down, so they upped my progesterone in oil to a higher level. 4 days later, I think my progesterone was in the high 20s, but I can&#39;t remember anymore.

Well it would appear I have a very serious decision to make. I currently am under the care of a private psychiatrist for my bipolar. My NHS obstetrician referred me to a specialist mental health team that work with pregnant women with serious mental illness. The risk being that I may get postnatal psychosis/depression so they need to know me incase I need to go to hospital. The team psychiatrist would like to treat me under her team but I wouldn't be able to continue seeing my current psychiatrist.

The team sound good. I would have a community psychiatric nurse who would visit me regularly until the baby was 12 months which sounds great. The problem is I'm not keen on the team psychiatrist. I love my current psychiatrist and really trust her but she doesn't have access to other services and it can be difficult to get an appointment with her in an emergency.

There is also an issue that the team psychiatrist would like to take me off one of my medications (I would to). It is having severe physical effects. However, I feel nervous about changing my medication while I'm pregnant when I have been so stable for so long. On the other hand, the less medication the better. I suppose in the end I could tell her that I didn't want to. I have a feeling my current psychiatrist would not feel good about it.

Anyway, I think I want to join the team and then go back to my old psychiatrist after 12 months. I'm seeing my current psychiatrist now so we'll see what she has to say. Hopefully she is agreeable. Wish me luck! Oh, and sorry for the wall of text. I think I needed to see it all written down!

We don&#39;t know why I went into preterm labor the second time. TRIGGER WARNING - Those 2 are now 7 months old (16 weeks adjusted), and are doing well,  all things considered. </p>

I was on progesterone at 12dpo and my progesterone was very high then (50 something?) At 6 weeks it dropped significantly (to 19) and my dosage was upped until 20ish weeks and my baby was born full term. My third pregnancy was an early miscarriage. I was on progesterone for three days until I lost the baby at five weeks.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve been researching progesterone because with my last loss (last week), the little embryo came out fully intact (not in a sac- it must have &quot;broke&quot;) and I have been trying to figure out what could have caused such an early miscarriage with a baby that seemed to be growing normally. </p>

I eschewed the recommendation after the first miscarriage because I didn&#39;t feel &quot;that bad,&quot; but then I spent my entire second pregnancy in a blur of terror/depression, so when it ended I knew it was time. The midwives I see gave me a recommendation for someone who specializes in grief/loss, I would recommend trying to find someone like that if you can. It&#39;s been such a huge help. I still have anxiety at times, but it&#39;s much more manageable now and I&#39;m 100% sure I wouldn&#39;t be at this point if not for therapy.  </p>

Yesterday I was nauseous as all hell the entire day and kept getting twinges in my stomach. Maybe it was gas or indigestion. I also had heartburn so I took Tums and felt better immediately. But the whole day I was on an empty stomach until I went to the movies with my husband, so I was practically dry heaving a lot. I've never had this as an AF symptom but I'm trying not to get my hopes up too much and I could chalk it up to my symptoms changing after giving birth. I saw a lot of people yesterday, I'm friends with my in laws so I could consider it a friend outing, and I had a lot of fun. Genuine, real fun. I was sad throughout the day because I was constantly reminded of Riyad, and how he's not here, but in between there was a lot of good times. I also went shopping this week and bought a bunch of new clothes that looked great on my body, because all I have are maternity clothes from my pregnancy and old clothing from before I got pregnant that mostly don't fit anymore. So I needed a confidence boost. Made me feel a million times better about myself.

I also had a nice moment last night, despite crying and grieving my son extra hard yesterday morning. I was completely relaxed and felt genuinely happy for the first time since my son died. Had a thought akin to ""I love my life,"" which I used to think constantly before my son died. I'm naturally a very happy person so sometimes it's an automatic thought. I used to push that away in my grief and feel guilty for thinking that, but last night I welcomed it and felt soooo content just being in the moment. It was a nice, short reprieve from the grief which returned today. 

Anyway that just gave me hope that I can handle all of this, I'm stronger than I think I am, than I pretty much ever thought I was, and I will get through this and hopefully one day have the family I always dreamt of having, with my little Riyad in heaven.

Edited to add: it's crazy how grief comes in waves. I was a WRECK Saturday morning and Friday night, couldn't stop crying, mainly because I found out my sister in law is pregnant and it reopened my wounds in a way. But I was so relaxed Sunday night. I'm expecting another wave of grief today to randomly hit me, but that's ok. If it comes and goes like this, its more manageable than hitting me for an extended period of time all at once.

I'm trying this therapy procedure at my therapist office, in addition to what I'm currently doing with her, called Brain Paint. I decided why not give it a try. It focuses on healing from trauma and PTSD. Pretty sure I have a lot of trauma after my son died because I replay and relive moments in the hospital in my head several times a day. It's like a constant loop. I'm trying to break that loop and hoping this will help.

Also, exercise helps A LOT! I was a crying depressed wreck Saturday morning, but I forced myself to the gym and became calmer after sweating and just zoning out to music. Forcing myself to let my grief out through physical activity, is really helpful for me.

Silly me, assuming my body would cooperate. 🙄 


I'm in a bit of a conundrum. There's a 2day, 225km bike ride in June in support of cancer research that a bunch of my close coworkers are doing. They wanted me to do it last year and I just didn't have the time to train, but promised I would this year...because at the time, we were still on the fence about having kids. Then we decided to TTC, and I should've been starting my mat leave in May. Now that I'm not even pregnant, I really want to do it, and they keep reminding me that I promised last year (they don't know about my losses) but it means putting off TTC for 2 maybe 3 months because I obviously will not risk doing it if I got pregnant again. You have to raise $3k so I neee to decide soon, also so I can start training. 

I'm so torn. I love the cause, I love the coworkers who are doing it, and it would be a great way to get back in shape because I've really let myself go since Nov.  I could probably use the time to work on myself emotionally too. BUT.....giving up 2-3 cycles when our baby future is unknown scares me. And next month is the last month we could conceive before my husband is 37 as a first time dad, and my guilt about that is pretty mjaor since we waited to TTC because of me.

<p>And then my brother&#39;s girlfriend just made a post asking for baby pictures from all her friends even though she knows that I literally just had my miscarriage a week ago. I know she doesn&#39;t need to care about me, but it just seemed like... I don&#39;t know.</p>

<p>That&#39;s the hardest thing for me. I&#39;m not sad that I miscarried, I was still early and it was at our first US that they told us it probably wasn&#39;t going to work out. So I hadn&#39;t really attached. It&#39;s just the loss of all the plans I had. Baby would have been born in October and so I would have been bringing them to my brother&#39;s wedding and Thanksgiving and Christmas. No more.</p>

<p>It&#39;s making me very bitter every time I see people talking about their babies. Which just makes me feel worse because I understand that they&#39;re happy or frustrated.   </p>

I am so, so happy to tell you all that my beautiful baby girl was born on Wednesday the 22nd of March weighing 3580g, or 7lb 14oz.

When we first went in to the hospital at 1.30AM I was only 1cm dilated, despite having had contractions for over 30 hours. They wanted to send me home but it was the middle of the night and I was finding the contractions quite painful so I refused to leave. The midwife who was assigned to us was really not happy about that! She was trying to persuade me to take some diamorhpine to slow the contractions down so I could get some sleep, but I'm sure you can imagine my reaction to that! I've never had a good response to opioids, and slowing labour down is the last thing I wanted! So that was a firm no! The midwife was absolutely insistent I wouldn't be having a baby that day, and warned us that while she could turn a blind eye to us being in the labour ward, I'd probably be moved off to the antenatal ward when the day staff came on. So they sort of left us alone for the rest of the night, and when the pain got really bad a nicer midwife we had met before came in and hooked me up to the NOx. When the day staff came on at about 8AM I was handed over to another midwife. I was still only 2cm dilated, but the new midwife was more than happy to keep me on the ward. She recommended that I take a hot bath to help me to relax, so we did that. I spent probably 40 minutes in the bath with the contractions getting more and more painful, managed somehow to get back to the bed and suddenly things seemed to speed up like crazy. I was starting to feel like I wanted to push, so my husband ran out to get a midwife back in there. Someone came in pretty quick to see what was happening and I was 6cm dilated! So that was the end of them treating me like I was some sort of drama queen! The midwife suggested we use the birthing pool because the bath had obviously been effective, so we had to wait for that to be cleaned and filled. I have absolutely no idea how long that took but it felt like an age! Anyway, I got in the pool eventually and laboured in there for a few hours. Things started off progressing really well, but once the head started crowning things slowed down. A more senior midwife was called in and after another hour of little progress she got me out of the pool. Things picked up again after that but by then I was absolutely exhausted and it started to become apparent that she was in an awkward position. So they called a doctor in and tried a couple of things to help thing along. I suddenly began to realise I hadn't had a drop of pain relief apart from the NOx, although it was far too late for any of that by then! Another hour of not much progress later the senior midwife said ""I can get this baby out with one cut if you agree to it"" and I was like ""yes! Please! Just do it!"" So I had an episiotomy and less than a minute later baby was completely born, head and body in one go. I have never been so relieved in my life! From the official start of labour (when I was suddenly 6cm dilated) to that moment took 5hr40, which isn't too bad I think! I know that an episiotomy wouldn't figure into most people's ""ideal"" birth, but for me I think that birthing experience really was as good as it could have been, and of course, it was all so worth it to have my warm little wriggly baby in my arms.

Baby girl is healthy and feeding well. I wasn't able to do a full hour of skin-to-skin myself because they needed to stitch me up, but that's what dads are for! So she got a full hour at least, and she started feeding not long after she was passed back to me. We've managed to 100% breastfeed so far, and it seems to be going well so hopefully we'll be able to carry on with that! But to be honest, I have a baby in my arms with two of everything she's supposed to have two of and ten of everything she's supposed to have ten of, so anything else is really just a bonus! I will try to update with pictures later!

[Pictures, as promised!](http://imgur.com/gallery/odbpT) These were all taken quite soon after she was born and before she was cleaned up.

Spent a week with my parents in south Florida after avoiding visiting for a whole year because of Zika. Spent that year trying to get pregnant, getting pregnant twice, and miscarrying twice. Not fun.

I did get bit by a mosquito, who bit me like 5 times (it got into my room somehow). But the cases of Zika in that part of Florida are really rare so. I think I'm okay.

I visited a friend who is currently the same amount of weeks pregnant that I would have been, if I had not lost the last one to a blighted ovum.

She is drinking multiple monster energy drinks and soda all day, and still smoking a few cigarettes a day. At 14 weeks. It bothered me so much. 

I was kind of livid but also just. I know who she is I am not surprised, let's just put it that way. She's someone I've known since we were 16 and this isn't bizarre behavior for her. I can't help but be angry that it was so easy for her to get pregnant and keep it, she has a daughter too and has never miscarried, and she basically lives a really unhealthy lifestyle. Meanwhile I've tried to be as healthy and responsible as possible for my future child and lost two pregnancies. Life is just unfair basically.
