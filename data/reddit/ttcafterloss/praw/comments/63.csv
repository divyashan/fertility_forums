The sperm sorting of very damaged fragmented sperm that’s used for normal IVF doesn’t select for such Sperm at all. PGS only tests if all chromosomes are normal and fragmented dna is responsible about how dna is packaged and unpackaged if it’s unpackaged too slow or too fast and has missing fragmented links (a chromosome can all be there but the links from each can be missing and that’s not detectable by PGS but transcription factors that make proteins from that strand can’t read it and can cause errors) it affects how embryo forms and grows and stops growing. All our babies have been chromosomal normal so PGS would have passed then with flying colors. Sure you may get lucky but thats what it would be. And I’m not paying 30k to go through pain to get lucky with huge odds against me when odds of IVF with normal sperm are already only 30%. High SDF sperm IVF or ICSI has double the risk for recurrent miscarriage also increased risk of cancer and stillbirths. Usually the chance of miscarriage after confirmed US is around 10% in IVF - with dna frag ICSI or IVF it’s more than 50%. It’s very sad REs don’t listen to reproductive urologists and get with the times. This may not be your issue but it’s a serious one. If the results are normal then you can proceed with IVF knowing it will likely fix whatever other issue if it’s chromosomal. Dna frag is a different thing all together. If you want to read about sperm Integrity and how it affects the formation of a baby the best book I’ve ever read about it is - is Genetic damage in human spermatozoa by Elizabeth baldi.  It will show you that any RE that gives you above advice doesn’t know shit about sperm dna damage or how it’s detrimental. It’s amazing and fascinating and I hope that REs get on board and stop giving everyone same treatment. Only 8% if men have sperm frag but we can’t treat it like the ones that do not.

Sorry for your losses!
Yes our first one was indeterminate because it was our first loss and they don’t routinely do testing. I insisted on the second one.
Yes I don’t have issues “getting” pregnant but all of my pregnancies so far didn’t end up in a healthy baby :(
I will start by checking with my insurance about coverage. Even if we have to pay out of pocket, we are almost certain that we want to try in the near future, hopefully.

I had 3 losses (2 CPs and 1 triploidy TFMR) out of 6 active attempts, which means I had a 50% pregnancy rate.

Because I presumed chromosomal issues (obviously for the triploidy), I decided to proceed with IVF for the PURPOSE of PGS.

First cycle: 0/2 normals. Second cycle: 0/2 normals again. Third cycle: only 2 embryos, so decided last-minute to do a fresh transfer of both without PGS. So far successful of 1.

So WTF, does this mean I didn’t have to go through IVF, since GETTING pregnant wasn’t the issue?!

A few weeks before the transfer, I had met with a second opinion RE who said that for only 1-3 embryos, I should just be doing fresh transfers, even at d3. The risk of false positives (and self-correction) is no longer tolerable with such few embryos. Other than that, she would send me home to just keep trying at home (since I have the ability to GET pregnant)

For your situation, you mentioned all 3 were due to chromosomal issues, but you only describe 2, so 1 is undetermined? 

Does your insurance cover IVF? If so then it might be a no-brainer to try at least 1 cycle, and see if you’re a good responder and can get like 5 embryos. Then PGS would make sense. However, if you only get a couple, then it might not worth it.

Each round of IVF took about 3 months (all the waiting for insurance, appts, PGS results, etc) so that means I could’ve tried at home for 3 cycles in that time.

Anyway that was a bit of a ramble, so please feel free to ask me any specific questions!",[],,t1_e4sddxw,False,0,[],False,"<div class=""md""><p>Thanks for the tag.</p>

<p>It&#39;s total understandable that you want to have all the &quot;pieces&quot; of your story, of this pregnancy.  It&#39;s understandable that you might have been looking forward to seeing those numbers, and getting some validation from them.   </p>

<p>I hope your mini-break gives you some time to rest and go easy on yourselves after everything you&#39;ve been through recently.  &lt;3</p>

Not ""perfect"" in the way you're describing, where I wanted to put the breaks on TTC if I did one thing off....but definitely on the conservative side relative to some.

Unfortunately the losses could be related or not...and you may never know. Plus, for your pain it doesn't matter at all. 

And honestly - I regret not doing testing on our first baby...but did it for the 2nd and got no answer. So its a double edged sword - I'm glad he was fine, but WHY THE FUCK DID HE DIE?! It is hard, but you can't go back and test so you need to just try to move forward from that. :( And if, God forbid, you have another loss, don't let the opportunity pass you by. That's all we can do, is learn from this shitty stuff. 

After our 5th loss, we planned to try 1 more time...and since we seem to conceive easily, our thought process was ""1 more pregnancy, but if its a loss we will consider IVF or be childfree.""  

We had already looked into IVF costs with my insurance and had discussed what route we'd go with meds/etc. So if we conceived and lost, we were ready to GO.

Our 6th pregnancy was successful, so we didn't get that far. 

If everything comes back normal, I think it comes down to how much more you can take...can you take another early loss (without IVF/PGS) and still hold it together? If you did IVF/PGS and had a loss...would you feel more pissed off that you spent that money or would you at least be happy you gave it ""the best shot""?  

Unfortunately, with this, I think its hard to know what you'll do at the next step until the next step arrives. After loss 2, I said ""If we have a 3rd, I'm done!"" Then my 3rd was a CP and I was like ""Well that wasn't nearly as bad, I could go again."". And I had 2 more losses so you can see that I kept changing ""what I could handle.""

Its hard to know how you'll feel if everything comes back normal. It's hard to know if PGS could help. Its all such a big question that it seriously boils down to how far you're willing to go/how much pain you can withstand. And that can change every single day.

I lost my daughter Anna to a cord complication at 35 weeks on May 24 2018. I've found that people have really disappeared where I thought they would be more supportive and I think a lot of it has to do with their own fear that they might say the wrong thing so better to say nothing at all. It's been a very isolating experience but I've appreciated the handful of family members and friends who have stepped up and been there for me. I think the main thing is to know that nothing you can say is going to ""fix"" this for her so don't even try. Acknowledge that this is completely unfair and it will never be okay that her daughter died. It doesn't matter if she has more children, this will always be the child that should have lived and this child deserves to be remembered and honoured. Like other comments have said, say your niece's name often and make sure she is always a part of your family. 

&#x200B;

I recently learned that October 15 is international remembrance day for babies lost in pregnancy or early infancy and there is a movement called ""Wave of Light"" where monuments across the globe are lit up in pink and blue to remember our lost children. Maybe you could look into having something in her town lit up for her daughter. I'm sure that would mean a lot.

I had a MMC in 2016 (should have been between 11-12 weeks, baby was measuring 8+5), and my rainbow was born a year later. We started TTC again this year and conceived after a few cycles. When I was 10-11 weeks I had my first scan, which showed an empty sac measuring 6-7 weeks. Despite this so obviously being a non-viable pregnancy, I had to wait a week for a follow up scan to make sure nothing was developing. My first loss everything happened quite quickly -- bad scan one day, D&C the next. With this one I had to spend a whole week knowing that things were terribly wrong and not being able to do anything about it. Sure enough, at the second scan there had been no growth. I had a D&C to end that pregnancy almost exactly three weeks ago. The hCG is taking a while to work its way out of my system but it is going down.

My husband also was reluctant to try again (and I have to say, so was I initially).He didn't want to put me through it and it wasn't fair on me. It turned out he was only saying this because it's what he thought I wanted to hear. We've since agreed to TTC again until the end of the year and then reconsider.

Has your husband been supportive emotionally? Mine has been really reticent. To start with he was just switched off basically, even before the pregnancy was over, because as far as he was concerned there was no baby so nothing to mourn. Slowly, slowly, in fits and spurts, we've manages to talk it through and I explained to him that even if the baby was too small to be seen on the scan, it doesn't mean it wasn't there. That even if there was no baby I'd been pregnant for 11 weeks and that meant something. He came around to my way of thinking and eventually agreed to have the remains cremated and we came up with a name for the baby together.

I got a baby whale and a mama whale because we said our ultrasound bean looked like a beluga whale, and with the grieving orca mama thats been in the news it feels even more special. I have it on my upper thigh, so it&#39;s visible for me when I&#39;m sad and lonely in my comfies and can touch it. </p>

We didn’t do any genetic testing after d&amp;c’s because insurance didn’t cover it and we couldn’t really afford it. I’m kind of regretting that decision.</p>

Why jizos are the symbol of infant and pregnancy loss in Japanese Buddhism 

It’s based on the Buddhist belief that you need to accumulate karma in your life to pass on to the afterlife. Sources argue whether or not babies and infants have no or negative karma. No karma because they haven’t done any good deeds in life or negative because they brought their parents suffering. Even if it wasn’t intentional. 

Souls have to cross the river Styx to move on from our life to the afterlife. You need enough karma to cross this river. The river is home to demons that can pull a soul into hell. These demons tell the unborn child’s soul that it can use rocks on the riverside to build a bridge and pass on. However, just before they’re finished the demons destroy the bridge. This was believed a never ending cycle of torment. 

Jizo was a monk who reached nirvana. Who was allowed to pass on. But he saw the torment and decided he would not move on until he saved every soul. So jizo would hide the unborn child’s soul in the line sleeves of his robe and cross the river to bring the child’s soul to safety and peace. He’s able to pass between our world and the afterlife freely, because he has reached nirvana but chose not to go to nirvana. Which makes him a boddhisattva (a semi Buddha in layman’s terms). Because of this ability he listens to the parents prayer and takes it and gifts left for the child on his statue and brings it to the child. He continues to watch out for the children until they are reunited with their parents in the afterlife. ",[],,t1_e4pjhl4,False,0,[],False,"<div class=""md""><p>Alright.

Schliep et al. didn&#39;t have the data to say how <em>many</em> in the 0-3 group started pre- vs. post- first period....but if they wanted to keep pre-period folks out, they certainly wouldn&#39;t have included women who started 0 months, i.e. immediately, after their losses.</p>

So, what chromosome testing are you waiting on? Karyotyping of you and your husband?

What is your REs reasoning, when he/she doesn't have any results showing this may be true? Have you done the first set of general testing on your hormones? 

Can you give us a rundown of your losses? How far along/how they happened/etc?

Its is commonly thought that many losses are caused by chromosomal abnormalities. But not all are. AND some possibly are but are caused by issues we still can't detect. Both in testing after loss and testing pre-transfer. 

Jumping to IVF without some of the normal testing on you is expensive and doesn't make a ton of sense. Plus, you can transfer a ""normal"" embryo and still have a miscarriage (or, of course, not get pregnant). 

Many doctors try to tell women with repeat loss to move to IVF and test embryos. But most women with repeat loss get pregnant without much trouble and its a tad of a cop out for a doctor to suggest IVF without some extensive testing beforehand. 

Can you give us a tad more info? 

Also, while some people here have done IVF, and I hope they can chime in, you may want to also check out r/infertility (and read the rules before posting, as mentions of living children/etc get hairy over there).

Didn't want to scroll past without commenting as I had this exact same experience recently so want to share it with you in case it's helpful.  I'll link my chart below - the May 26th chart is where it happened, I had a positive about 12 days after what I thought was a period, and only tested because I had three days in a row of strong positive OPKs, which I thought was weird. I don't know if this 'period' was the MC or not - the day before that bleed I tested negative so had no reason to think it wasn't  a normal period  My next bleed came 4 weeks after the first one and was confirmed as a MC. I had an ultrasound and HCG drawn that day and three days later, where it went from 150 to 50. I went back four weeks after that for another one (2 days ago) and the levels are now at 2. The only advice I had from the doctor was not to use tampons, and to go to the ER if the pain or bleeding became very bad (bc this was a Friday so her office wouldn't be open over the weekend). she also to wait two cycles to try again, but honestly I'm only waiting one. It is taking my body some time to get back to normal. All symptoms disappeared the day of the confirmed MC, but really all I had was sore boobs and fatigue. However I'm on CD35 now and think I maaaay have ovulated in the last day or two, so my cycle is definitely taking it's time to get back to normal. 

Again, I'm so sorry this happened to you, I know how absolutely crap it is, between the confusion of wondering how the heck I got a BFP to the trying to be hopeful. Even tho I knew from the beginning that it was off, I was still devastated when the MC was confirmed. Feel free to contact me if you have any other questions. Look after yourself x

I had an ultrasound and HCG drawn that day and three days later, where it went from 150 to 50. I went back four weeks after that for another one (2 days ago) and the levels are now at 2. The only advice I had from the doctor was not to use tampons, and to go to the ER if the pain or bleeding became very bad (bc this was a Friday so her office wouldn&#39;t be open over the weekend). she also to wait two cycles to try again, but honestly I&#39;m only waiting one. It is taking my body some time to get back to normal. All symptoms disappeared the day of the confirmed MC, but really all I had was sore boobs and fatigue. However I&#39;m on CD35 now and think I maaaay have ovulated in the last day or two, so my cycle is definitely taking it&#39;s time to get back to normal. </p>

<p>Again, I&#39;m so sorry this happened to you, I know how absolutely crap it is, between the confusion of wondering how the heck I got a BFP to the trying to be hopeful. Even tho I knew from the beginning that it was off, I was still devastated when the MC was confirmed. Feel free to contact me if you have any other questions. Look after yourself x</p>

They wanted to see if conceiving soon after a miscarriage led to worse outcomes. They compared women who started TTCing 0-3 months after their miscarriage with women who waited more then 4 months. Their conclusion: no increased risks from starting to TTC early.  

(It's important *not* to conclude from this study that starting to TTC/getting pregnant later is riskier. Why not?

Well, in the Schliep study, there were confounding factors. Women who started TTC/conceived earlier tended to be more educated, wealthier, less likely to be a smoker, and less likely to have a diagnosis of subfertility. The authors can't determine how much these other factors contributed to (slightly) worse outcomes.  All they can say is that women who started TTC early *didn't* fair worse than those following the conventional advice to wait.)

So there's not a strong medical reason to avoid TTC until you've had a period. That being said, it's good to wait until you get a negative with whatever HPT you'll be using to test for a BFP so when you start doing HPT's you can be sure it's not residual hCG you're getting.  

The Love study is another that I've seen referenced, but I don't prefer it.  In that study, the later a woman conceived, the more likely the pregnancy was to end in a termination (2% for the< 6mos. group vs. 10% for the >2yr group). The authors didn't distinguish between elective terminations and TFMRs. Given how rare TFMRs are (not 10% of pregnancies!), it seems that there were big differences in elective terminations across groups. But the authors don't account for this. If you exclude terminations, then the differences in live birth outcomes are much smaller (~87% for the < 6 mos. group and ~82% for the rest). And similar to the Schliep study, some of that remaining gap is likely due to health/habits associated with socioeconomic differences, smoking, etc.  

Because of these issues, I think one has to be quite careful in trying to draw conclusions from the Love paper.  It also applies less to your situation, because the earliest comparison group was women who *conceived* in under 6 months after their loss...whereas you're more interested in 0 cycles vs. 1 cycle.

I went to a parent support group for perinatal loss that was a big help in my healing.  One of the facilitators there shared her story with parents in your situation.  She'd had a c-section during her loss, and she did *not* wait the recommended time her doctor gave her.  

During her subsequent pregnancy, her uterus ruptured. (This is what you're trying to avoid by waiting.) Luckily, she and baby both survived.  But it was life threatening for both of them, and I don't know if they were able to save her uterus.   So she tells everyone in the same position who comes to the group, *please* don't do what I did.  

Waiting is so tough--I know how much I just wanted to be pregnant again after losing my son.  But going through that--possibly losing your baby, your ability to have other children, or even your life, isn't worth the risk--according to the woman who lived it.  Not to mention, PAL is full of plenty of anxiety as it is, and in a process where so much is out of our control, this is a big thing you *do* have some control over.  

I will say that I have heard of women being given shorter wait times--but that may be due to the type of c-section they had and/or the gestational age at which the c-section was performed.  If you wanted to get a second opinion, though, to address any doubts you might have about the time frame, that would be very reasonable.

We have ultrasound photos and videos, and photos of Rhys after he was born, but they are tucked away and I haven&#39;t felt compelled to look at them.  It might be strange but when I need to remember him or need a release I go back and read the text messages and whatsapp messages between myself, my husband, and friends and family from around when things started to go bad.  Sometimes I just need to remind myself that this actually happened, and moreso that I got through it.  We are 7 months post-loss and having lots of good days now.  I still get very sad and the strangest things blindside me with grief, but we are healing.  </p>

<p>&#x200B;</p>

<p>I wish you all the best with the logistics of the procedure and in your healing.  Lean on each other and try not to judge each others&#39; grieving process.  Thinking of you x</p>

In terms of Amazon Prime: **The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel** and **The Americans**.

In terms of Showtime: **Billions**.

2) **Signal** \- A police mystery with time travel. Yessssss.

3) **Circle: Two Worlds Connected** \- Mystery/Sci Fi, *also* with time travel.

It felt strange at first to make ""special"" arrangements for a ""fetus""--a little as if we were doing too much.  But now, it's hard to imagine we'd do anything else.  

If we lived near family, we might have considered a burial someplace where other family are buried.  But we don't, so it didn't make sense to have him buried someplace that wasn't meaningful to us.  

I'd say that we didn't *plan* to keep the baby's ashes with us as long as we have.  We know some people who scattered them in the ocean, or a beautiful spot in nature.  We talked about doing that, too.  But as the time grew closer, I worried about putting the ashes someplace we might not be able to visit if we were to move.  It's part of the whole ""hard to know how you're going to feel..."" stuff.

But your choices aren't only ""have the clinic take care of the remains"" or ""have ashes at home.""  If, after baby's ashes are home, you and your husband still feel that having them at home makes healing harder, you can scatter them someplace meaningful to you--either on your own, or with supportive family/friends.  

As others have mentioned, it seems like people most regret what they had an opportunity to do, but chose not to.  I think the advice to do as much as you can to keep your options open is sound.  (We took not just pictures, but videos of our son after he was born.  I still haven't watched the videos...but it's a comfort to know that if/when I want to, they're there.)  

On a side note, when the hospital did ""footprints"", it was actually footprints *and* hand prints.  I love having both--it's probably something you can ask for explicitly, if they're already doing footprints.  

Also, I wouldn't have thought to ask for this myself, but one woman asked for ultrasound pictures right before her TFMR.

I opted into some things because I didn’t want to regret not having done it one day.

I didn’t have a D&E, but I delivered my son at 17 weeks at the hospital. It was very sudden – I delivered at 1pm after having found out we lost him at 9am, so I hadn’t made any plans or thought anything through. After I delivered, they asked if I wanted to hold him, and I burst into tears and said I didn’t know. I had no idea what he would look like and if I’d want to remember him that way. We already knew he was a boy, but we named him that day. I needed him to feel real. It was hard on me that it was considered a miscarriage when I’d felt him kick, and I felt like naming him acknowledged that little life, however brief it was. Eventually, we decided to hold him after some encouragement from my nurse who reassured me that he looked perfect, just small. I treasure those moments so much now. It was such a strange mix of overwhelming love for my son and indescribable grief at what we lost, but I think it was healing to hold him. I stayed overnight in the hospital, and we kept him in the room with us because I couldn’t stand the thought of him being “alone.” I love that I know he had Greek’s foot (the 2nd toe longer than the big toe) and the most perfect, elegant little fingers. I’ll also say that I think holding him was important for my husband. He didn’t get to experience the kicks like I did, and those moments of us just sitting there holding our son and crying brought us closer together. I feel like it’s helped us support each other to have had that shared experience.

We had him cremated following an autopsy, and a local funeral home did it for free. Your clinic should be able to advise you there. Most funeral homes in my area will cremate at no charge for babies that small. It’s comforting for me to have a piece of him at home, even though I know it isn’t really HIM. Again, for me, it was more about acknowledging his life in whatever way I could. Truthfully though, that particular process WAS stressful, but it was mostly because the hospital took forever to do the autopsy and release the body, so we didn’t get his ashes until maybe 2 weeks after. My husband definitely had to take the lead on fielding phone calls because I just couldn’t. Going to the funeral home to do the paperwork and listing myself as ""mother"" for the first time was heartbreaking, but I don't regret it.

Below is my experience - some parts may be relevant and some may not, so I hope you can find this helpful. 

We headed out of state to a clinic similar to Planned Parenthood. I knew this was going to be the best choice based on insurance not covering our procedure, but it still didn't really prepare me for the protesters and their signs and the shouting. They didn’t know anything about our situation, obviously, but it made me sick to my stomach walking into the clinic with these people yelling at us. It also absolutely broke my heart to see how many people were also at the clinic terminating babies that they just didn’t want. The clinic had a private waiting room, so we didn't have to sit with anyone else. We found out later that this costs extra, but they waived it for us considering our situation, which I really appreciated. They took us back to do an ultrasound, which we did not want to see or hear or get prints of, and they respected that. Side note – they charge based on the current week of the fetus, and I basically had to haggle the price when they claimed that the baby was 12+6 when I knew I was 12+1. I did *not* appreciate that. They accepted it when I told them I’d had several ultrasounds and knew exactly to the day. 

I doubt the actual procedure will be the same given that you’re significantly further along than I was (i.e. no Cytotec) so I’m not certain how that will go for you. I do hope that you get to be under some form of sedation. This was also an additional price, but well worth it. They called it the ‘comfort shot’ which wound up being fentanyl. I do not remember much about this process right after, but some hazy memories started forming a few days afterwards. 

As I said before, they did not take footprints and we could not get the remains back. That all really bummed me out in the moment, because I really wanted something tangible to remember the baby by. We decided on a memorial tree for our baby (specifically a gingko), as I like the idea that our memory is a living thing that we can watch over while it grows.  

To include more information like u/aeb949 ‘s post, we did not get a heartbeat recording, but I wish we would have. Actually, I only heard it once (at our suspicious NT scan) and my husband never got to. I’ve never told him that I did, because I always wanted us to hear it together for the first time but the nurse played it for a few seconds without warning and he was not at the appointment. We do have our ultrasound photos, and I treasure those. We did not have an official name either. We found out the sex at the same time we found out that there was a high risk for Trisomy 18, and that was one of the saddest moments we experienced besides the actual procedure. We did have our genetic counselor write down the sex in a little card. I wanted to know it, and my husband did not originally. We decided, however, that we would assign different tree types to the gender – red maple if boy and gingko if girl. It made it more tolerable and much more real knowing who exactly we were saying goodbye to. 

We also had a very beautiful moment the day before we said goodbye to our daughter. We took the dog for a hike in a nearby state park, climbed these cliffs and overlooked this beautiful river. We sat and cried and talked about how this was a perfect way to say goodbye. On the hike, a ladybug landed on my face/shoulder. About thirty minutes later in a completely different area of the park, another ladybug landed on my husband's hand. We Googled and found this: ""Some cultures presume having a ladybug land on you brings good luck, or that whatever a ladybug lands on will be replaced with an improved version."" We just knew that it was the baby saying goodbye and good luck. I have never had a ladybug land on me in my entire life, so to have this happen to us both on this day was just an absolute sign. I ordered a ladybug ring and wear it every day. 

I’m so sorry that you are going through this. It breaks my heart for all of you. A TFMR is a special kind of hell because of the “choice” involved in this. u/aeb949 said it the best to me shortly after I had reached out to her and before the actual procedure – “Based on what we’ve learned and seen, the choice to terminate was obvious for us. Obviously as mothers, this is not a choice we ever want to have to make. But it’s also our responsibility to protect our children from suffering. I have no living children, but I still consider myself a mother because I’ve had to make difficult decisions and endure hardships in order to protect my child. And ultimately, that is what makes a good parent. You are making the right decision.”

And, as many others have said, completely personal--what's right for other people might not be what's right for you.

It's been almost 7 months since my D&E, and so far, my husband and I are happy with all the decisions we made. These decisions were guided by wonderful input I received from users on this subreddit ([thread here](https://www.reddit.com/r/ttcafterloss/comments/7tle88/intro_post_advice_on_beginningpreparing_to_cope/)), which seemed to share the theme that personalizing/humanizing the baby was helpful in the grieving process, even if it felt more painful in the short term.

Here is what we chose to do:

1. **We recorded her heartbeat.** I don't listen to this often because it's still a bit too painful. But I do in the moments when I miss her the most, and I'm so thankful we have this.
2. **We got ultrasound pictures.** Again, I don't look at these too often, but I'm so thankful we have them. We keep them in a little tin box along with my positive pregnancy test and a little onesie that my brother and sister-in-law had bought before we lost her.
3. **We did not hold her.** This is because I had a D&E under general anesthesia. I don't have any regrets about this--I was too emotionally fragile to go through an induction, and the footprints were enough for us.
4. **We had her cremated** and keep her in a beautiful little urn on our mantle ([photo here](https://i.imgur.com/84d5KEf.jpg)) under a fake bonsai tree, a jizo statue (which my mother gave us after reading [this beautiful NY Times article about miscarriage](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/06/well/family/the-japanese-art-of-grieving-a-miscarriage.html)), and a marble 4-legged animal statue (we've had this marble creature for years, and I moved him next to the urn because I imagined him as our daughter's protector or something--pregnancy loss has made me a little weird). The urn is very tiny--it fits in the palm of my hand. Both of us are comforted by having her near us. It doesn't feel morbid at all, and it helped give us closure to be able to bring her home with us, even if it wasn't in the way we wanted. Eventually, we might scatter her ashes. But for now, we just want her nearby. In terms of logistics, a social worker at the hospital told us that local funeral homes (i.e., in your home town) tend to cremate babies for free. So, we called up a funeral home in our town and sure enough, they covered *everything*. They were so wonderful--they also picked up the remains from the hospital. I suspect the funeral homes surrounding the clinic will have had inquiries of this nature before. I'd give them a call if you think you'd be *at all* interested in having the ashes down the line. It if makes you uncomfortable at first, you can always hide them away somewhere for a while. I noticed you mentioned your uncle's ashes inform your own feelings about keeping ashes at home. I also have an uncle (two, actually) who committed suicide, so I can see why any association with that would lead to complicated feelings. All I can say is that for me, it felt very different when it was my own child.
5. **We did not give her an ""official"" name.** But we have continued to call her by the nickname we gave her while she was still here--the name we had been unofficially calling her throughout the pregnancy. As u/joh_ah mentioned, it's been helpful to have something to refer to her as.
6. **We found out the sex.** This has helped us feel like she was a real person. Because after four months of pregnancy, she was real to us, and she was part of our family. It didn't feel right to continue referring to her as ""it.""

My husband and I also bought necklaces that remind us of our daughter. I wear it every day, even to exercise and sleep and shower. The only times I don't wear it is if I'm wearing some other necklace that might damage it. In this case, I usually remove the necklace but bring it with me in my wallet. It was a very difficult transition to go from being pregnant to un-pregnant, from feeling full to feeling empty. I felt like she was ripped away from me (because she was, literally). The necklace helped (and still helps) me feel like she is still with me, still feeling my warmth and my pulse.

In general, my philosophy going into our D&E was that we should do as much as possible and then decide later what we wanted to keep or hide away. I figured I would rather do too much than too little--I didn't want to regret not having a certain memento or memory. And in the moment, I just didn't feel capable of deciding what to do and what not to do. I couldn't anticipate what would be comforting to us in the future. I'd never experienced this kind of grief before. In the end, I'm happy we took that approach.

I'm pinging another TFMR mom, u/beany_babies, who also had her D&E done at an out-of-state clinic (which, by the way, is a complete abomination--ALL women should be able to have this physically and emotionally traumatic *medical procedure* done at a *hospital* with *doctors* and have it be covered by *insurance* because it is *medically indicated*). She might be able to comment on what options were available to her and what she wishes she had known.

This is so difficult. Thinking of you.

Part of why we opted for induction rather than the D&E was so we could see the baby and take pictures.  My husband and I didn't know how we felt about *holding* the baby.  When the time came, it was a good experience.(We didn't put him down for four hours.)  

We also didn't find out the sex until the baby was born, but picked out names before we went to the hospital. For us, naming the baby was good not just for us, but for our family.  We don't talk about him a lot, but my mom in particular uses his name when she speaks about him. 

We opted to have the baby cremated.  No one in my family has been cremated, and I always thought it sounded a little morbid to have someone's ashes at home.  But again, when the time came, it felt ""right"" to ""have him with us.""  I thought we might want to scatter his ashes on his due date, but we don't know if we'll move out of the area at some point, and so for now, we're keeping him with us.

We choose a funeral home with some good reviews online, and a website where everything was laid out: i.e. just stating that they do cremations for fetuses--one cost for <20 wks, and slightly more for >20 wks--and what the simplest cremation entailed. It was helpful to not have to ask questions over the phone.  

We brought the funeral home information to the hospital, and someone there contacted the funeral home for us, and took care of most of the paperwork.  We went to the funeral home after leaving the hospital, just to sign the paperwork, and leave a few items that we wanted cremated with the baby.  The funeral home sent someone to the hospital to pick up and transfer the remains.  We didn't have to do that.  

We picked out a container for an urn, and when we went back to pick up the ashes, someone there transferred them for us.  Another TFMR family we know wanted to have an urn specially made, so they initially got their son's ashes back in a simple box, and transferred them themselves later.  (We were told the ashes are enclosed a plastic bag, not loose.) We also received a certificate of cremation. (Our state does not issue death certificates for TFMRs.)  

The funeral home website also stated that they could provide the ashes in e.g. a TSA compliant plastic container, so it seems like it's not uncommon for families to transfer their out-of-state loved ones remains across state lines.  

I'm glad we made the decisions we made.  But I've also read about couples making very different decisions, and those being the right ones for them.  It's very personal, and hard to judge in advance.  I'm pinging alums /u/aeb949, /u/tuesdaysarehard, and /u/k_oshi, in case they can share their perspectives, too.

ETA: I got our full amnio report after the TFMR, and the baby's sex was there.

You are exactly right that the difficulty interpreting it all makes it so much harder. All the reading I have done has given me very little concrete to go on. It seems that the medical community isn’t even sure whether multiple chemical pregnancies ‘count’ as repeat pregnancy loss. (But if they don’t, what are they? If two aren’t a problem, will someone help me if I have three? Five? Ten?) Even when they’re included in definitions, they seem to be very rarely actually studied. So then everyone says they are ‘common’, but nobody really knows *how* common, so it’s hard to figure out what’s statistically unlikely to be just bad luck. And everything says that chromosomal abnormalities are the most common cause, but when you try to go further than that, like ok, but what proportion have other causes? Or, ok, how likely is it then that *all* my eggs are shitty - how long should I just keep trying to catch a good one? Then you’re at a brick wall again. 

Never mind the potential treatments! Progesterone supplementation… it’s clearly widely practiced and many people think it has helped them, yet trials seem to show it doesn’t help RPL (but does help prevent miscarriage for women using assisted reproductive technologies… wat? why?!). Maybe IVF with pre-implantation embryonic screening would help if egg quality is the issue?? But then, again, even though it’s widely practiced, randomised controlled trials seems to suggest it doesn’t actually achieve anything…  Argh!! 

Anyway, I also just read ‘It Starts with the Egg’ and have started chugging CoQ10, replacing all my personal care products and denying myself white bread like there’s no tomorrow! I’m glad to have some action to take, although I can’t help but feel a twinge of annoyance/resentment that other people are just popping them out without trying, while I am having to stress about whether using a plastic spatula to cook my dinner is going to mean I never make it past week five.

Ah well. I guess we just have to keep going and keep trying things. I hope that one of the things you’re trying helps and you get your happy ending soon 😊

Progesterone supplementation… it’s clearly widely practiced and many people think it has helped them, yet trials seem to show it doesn’t help RPL (but does help prevent miscarriage for women using assisted reproductive technologies… wat? why?!). Maybe IVF with pre-implantation embryonic screening would help if egg quality is the issue?? But then, again, even though it’s widely practiced, randomised controlled trials seems to suggest it doesn’t actually achieve anything…  Argh!! </p>

<p>Anyway, I also just read ‘It Starts with the Egg’ and have started chugging CoQ10, replacing all my personal care products and denying myself white bread like there’s no tomorrow! I’m glad to have some action to take, although I can’t help but feel a twinge of annoyance/resentment that other people are just popping them out without trying, while I am having to stress about whether using a plastic spatula to cook my dinner is going to mean I never make it past week five.</p>

<p>Ah well. I guess we just have to keep going and keep trying things. I hope that one of the things you’re trying helps and you get your happy ending soon 😊</p>

Like the fact that it was not a viable pregnancy doesn't make it irrational to be upset about losing it. You thought, with good reason, that you were pregnant and having a baby. You were thrilled and excited about it. Then, suddenly, you learned that you weren't having that much-wanted baby after all. Not only that, but you went through an ectopic, which is a scary experience. It is perfectly human, normal, reasonable and rational to be upset about that. The fact that the pregnancy was never viable really has no logical bearing on what your experience was and the rationality or otherwise of your emotional response to it. Like, what if you left your husband at the altar because you had never really loved him. Would it be irrational of him to be upset because he never really had your love anyway, he just *thought* he did? Of course not! All human beings get upset when they think something momentous and wonderful is happening and it is suddenly taken away. 

Expecting you to be able to turn off your emotional response to losing a wanted pregnancy is not rational, it's silly and unfair. That's not how people work. It's not how your husband would work if he was upset about something either! I am not sure what you could say to him to get him to understand that you simply want him to see your pain, acknowledge you're hurting, accept it and just be there with you as you get through it in your own time. But I hope you can work it out and/or get that support you need elsewhere. <3

Our doctor told us that a lot of first pregnancies end in miscarriage, I can’t remember the statistic but it’s so common.

I told someone yesterday. Finally. I haven't even told my mom yet because she is currently battling cancer and has her own stress to worry about that I don't want to further complicate. 

We were at a family party for my husband, and I was talking to his aunt, whom I love. She has three kids and her oldest is about to go off to college. She was talking about their spacing and how the youngest is four years younger than the middle... and how that's a bigger gap than she wanted. She's said that to me before, but this time she said told me that she had been pregnant in between, but lost the baby.

She seemed sad, actually - emotional about it. Maybe she had a hunch about me. I don't know. But I had been drinking a lot (praise be the ability to drink once again at social functions) and felt safe opening up to her, so I told her that I had just miscarried. That I was 12 weeks pregnant with twins. She was so warm and compassionate and talked with me at length, and it was so good to talk to someone who had been through something similar. Her baby had trisomy 18, discovered at the NT scan, and she had a D&C. I don't know anyone else personally who had to have a D&C in the almost-second trimester (everyone in my life who has told me about their miscarriage had one naturally early on), so it was just so relieving to be able to talk to someone who had to go through that, too. And we talked about how hard it is when you already have kids and you feel guilty in your grief because you have friends who can't get pregnant at all and shouldn't you just be grateful for your living kids but somehow trying to think that feels worse and no it's fucking devastating and awful and raw. 

After spending most of the party being told how beautiful my son is (he is) and how we should make another baby (I know, I desperately want to), and being asked if we want to have more kids (and having to say, yeah probably, and suppress my urge to to shout ""I was pregnant with twins and I wanted those babies SO BAD""), it felt so good to be honest.

If you are open to considering a D&amp;C in hope for an alaysis, ask your hospital the protocol. I&#39;m not familiar with NHS rules, but even in the US they have weird protocol.

Tracking ovulation can be a little tricky right after a D&C or D&E since you may still have some leftover HCG lingering around. HCG sometimes causes positive OPKs even if you aren't actually surging. For me, I figured I wouldn't be getting accurate data until I knew the HCG was out of my system and I'd had a period. Unfortunately, it took a little longer for me to get there. My HCG didn't drop down to zero until 6ish weeks after my D&C, but once it did my period started a few days later. 

That first period wasn't notably different than previous, ""normal"" periods flow-wise. Maybe a little smoother. (I know this is TMI, but) there was very little clotting if any for that period. I think my hormone levels are still a little wonky since I don't get quite as predictable PMS symptoms as I did before I got pregnant and miscarried. It took about 3 or 4 cycles after my m/c to start getting tender nipples during my LP like I normally do.

TW - MMC, CP, LTTTC

In our seventh year of TTC this year (including over the years six losses - three natural, three assisted) we finally decided to have one final attempt, and to go with donor eggs AND sperm (our issues are essentially unexplained so we thought let’s just throw the kitchen sink at it).  We spent all the last of our savings and borrowed too. I’m also no longer earning as I had to stop work due to trauma from recurrent loss and infertility. So in April we started the process. New diet, new protocol - hormones, blood thinners, steroids, immune suppressants - pessaries, subcutaneous injections, intramuscular injections, intravenous infusions, the works. 

The cycle was hard - our donor had seemed super fertile, producing 14 big follicles. But on collection day, they only retrieved 6 mature eggs.

Two embryos survived, and we had one transferred - told it was Triple A expanding - the perfect specimen. We couldn’t afford PGS for just two embryos, and were reassured we didn’t need it - we had two healthy fertile donors and a top-notch embryo. 

Incredibly, I not only became pregnant, but we discovered our embryo had been so keen it had split in two - we had identical twins! A miracle. Two strong heartbeats seen at first ultrasound.  It was finally going to happen. We would become parents finally, at 39 and 40 years old (trying since we were 31 and 32). And we could complete our family in one go - after all, we couldn’t afford to try for a sibling with all the drugs I was recommended and the cost of FET. But I could now go back to work to at least start earning again ahead of the twins’ arrival. 

My body started changing - finally actually visibly ‘proveably’ pregnant after all my chemical pregnancies! I started to relax and believe. I’m going to be a mother after all! Midwives and consultants and therapists all said I could relax - it was different this time. Everything looked perfect. We gave them names.

And then this week. Their hearts stopped. Both of them. And tomorrow I’m going to hospital. And when I return it will once again be just me and my husband, alone with no hope and no money and with this desperate clawing gaping rasping grief for the babies we love and miss so much and can’t understand why we couldn’t be allowed to have them.

Thank you for reading.

This is the exact person I was afraid of becoming. I didn&#39;t want to be this type of crazy TTC woman. But I can&#39;t help it. We&#39;ve made a choice to wait this long. I guess we have not been trying  for 2 long according to OB. 10 months is nothing to worry about. I have my mother&#39;s voice in the back of my head, &quot;you best be careful, you are super fertile&quot;. Something she would say this to me before prom, going off to college and brining home my now husband 10 years ago. Well guess what mom, apparently I&#39;m not super fertile like you were! Now my head is hurting and my cramps are getting worst. Time to burry myself under the covers again.</p>

Families are weird.  My sister and I were due a week apart (her second, my first)...after our loss, she sent a few ""thinking of you"" texts and a little care package.  But when we visited my family four weeks later, neither she or my BIL said *anything*.  It was like our loss hadn't happened--we were just supposed to act like it was any other ""happy holiday.""  

My dad just said they were sad for us--but didn't want to see any pictures of our son.  Mom only asked to see them the day before we left.  And rather than asking about what we were going through, she wanted *me* to listen to how *she* felt about our loss, and the complications/scares with *her* (ultimately healthy) deliveries.  Oh, and also let us know that X family friend couldn't be told it was a TFMR because he's anti-abort!on.  

About 2 months later, both my mom and my MIL asked how we were doing, and when they learned I was still having a hard time, they were surprised.  Like 12 weeks after your baby dies...with your niece about to be born while your son won't be....I should be feeling better?

I know everyone means well, but people who haven't been through it are just really bad at knowing how to be supportive.  And that made me want to share *less* about how I'm doing.  And you're right: it's isolating.  

But we understand.  I also found a bereavement counselor and a parent support group to be helpful.  It helped me to have people IRL who understood what we were going through.

It was like our loss hadn&#39;t happened--we were just supposed to act like it was any other &quot;happy holiday.&quot;  </p>

<p>My dad just said they were sad for us--but didn&#39;t want to see any pictures of our son.  Mom only asked to see them the day before we left.  And rather than asking about what we were going through, she wanted <em>me</em> to listen to how <em>she</em> felt about our loss, and the complications/scares with <em>her</em> (ultimately healthy) deliveries.  Oh, and also let us know that X family friend couldn&#39;t be told it was a TFMR because he&#39;s anti-abort!on.  </p>

<p>About 2 months later, both my mom and my MIL asked how we were doing, and when they learned I was still having a hard time, they were surprised.  Like 12 weeks after your baby dies...with your niece about to be born while your son won&#39;t be....I should be feeling better?</p>

<p>I know everyone means well, but people who haven&#39;t been through it are just really bad at knowing how to be supportive.  And that made me want to share <em>less</em> about how I&#39;m doing.  And you&#39;re right: it&#39;s isolating.  </p>

<p>But we understand.  I also found a bereavement counselor and a parent support group to be helpful.  It helped me to have people IRL who understood what we were going through.  </p>

<p>I hope you and your husband are taking good care of yourselves and each other! &lt;3</p>

No real need for me to pile on here because, as usual, u/joh_ah has an amazing explanation of the science. Just wanted to add (mainly from my own experience losing a daughter to Trisomy 18) that the wording ""EXTRA WHOLE CHROMOSOME 16"" means that the Trisomy 16 was definitively not inherited.

If you google ""trisomy \_\_\_"" you might see that in rare circumstances (I believe \~5% for Trisomy 18), extra chromosomes can be inherited even if the parents are asymptomatic. This usually happens when there is something called a ""balanced translocation,"" which is when one part of a chromosome gets chopped off and swapped with part of a different chromosome. This is a little gross, but imagine chopping off the tip of your thumb and the tip of your index finger and swapping them (so that the tip of your thumb is attached to your index finger and vice-versa). You'd get pretty weird looking fingers, but you'd technically still have all the parts of your fingers--they'd just be in different locations. This is why some people can have this kind of swapping going on but are asymptomatic--the genes are still all there. Anyway, if one parent has this, the baby can inherit the parent's jumbled chromosome \*in addition\* to two normal chromosomes (e.g., two normal chromosome 18's and then a wonky chromosome 9 with a huge chunk of a chromosome 18 stuck off of it--the baby got two index fingers, but it also got a thumb that had a piece of an index finger stuck onto it...so it really has more than 2 index fingers), which would lead to a trisomy. But if this were the case, they would have found chromosome fragments attached in places they shouldn't be. The fact that they found a WHOLE (i.e., non-jumbled) extra chromosome means it wasn't inherited from a parent with a chopped and swapped chromosome.

In any case, we were very reassured to see that our baby had a EXTRA WHOLE CHROMOSOME 18. It means it was an error of cell division early in embryonic development, as u/joh_ah described, and it's \*very\* unlikely to repeat itself. I hope that's as reassuring to you as it was to us.

I hope your RE/geneticist can give you an even better understanding of all this. (Although, what u/joh_ah said is spot on!)

After this, we'll be scooting into cycle 6. And after cycle 6, my OB recommended we get some basic testing done.

I'm also inclined to pull the trigger on IVF sooner rather than later--if that's where we're likely headed, it would be best to try to get in a transfer or two before our insurance changes.

In the meantime, I've decided to drastically cut down on my wine consumption. That way, at least I'll feel like I'm doing something. I usually drink 1-1.5 glasses each night with dinner. I haven't seen any good data that this level of drinking affects TTC--or at least, there are conflicting reports. And I haven't been stressing about it so far because:

1. My goal with TTC after our loss was to think about TTC less than I did pre-loss (which was a lot). Thinking ""oh I'd better not have any wine because I'm trying to get pregnant!"" means thinking about TTC. So I've just been drinking the damn wine without worrying about it.
2. Denying myself wine makes me feel even dumber when I get that BFN. So, drinking wine is one strategy I have of lowering my expectations--I'm going to get a BFN, so what does it matter if I have a glass of wine right now?
3. I've been trying not to view my body as overly fragile. This has been part of my mission to rebuild trust in my body--why should a glass of wine each night tank my egg quality? Plenty of women get pregnant who are much less healthy than I am.
4. This article (my favorite piece of writing about TTC-related matters): [https://www.newstatesman.com/lifestyle/2015/02/trying-get-pregnant-hard-enough-without-being-told-not-drink](https://www.newstatesman.com/lifestyle/2015/02/trying-get-pregnant-hard-enough-without-being-told-not-drink)

Still, I suppose it's better to drink less alcohol--not just for TTC, but for overall health. So I might as well give it a try.

\*phew!\* Thanks for letting me bore you with these details. It helps to put it all in writing and send it off into the ether. Wishing you all the best.

Tubal factor infertility here. Had three ectopic pregnancies that eventually lost me both my tubes. One thing I would first suggest is to see if your OB is willing to offer a HSG (hysterosalpingogram) test once you’re healed from your surgery to see if your remaining tube is patent and appears normal. This is an X-ray procedure where contrast dye is forced up through your tubes to visualize their shape and whether they are open or blocked. This should give you some information about whether your tube has healed OK and if it’s safe to try again on your own. It’s recommended after an ectopic, as far as I know; my fertility doc insisted I have one after each tubal pregnancy before we could try again. 

It may also be worthwhile to have a consult with a fertility specialist (reproductive endocrinologist, or RE) to seek their opinion. If nothing else, they will likely be happy to monitor a subsequent pregnancy very closely looking for another ectopic - early pregnancy scans and detailed early pregnancy bloodwork are something they routinely do that your OB may not. All my ectopics were caught within a few days to a week of getting pregnant because I was being so closely watched by my RE. It turned a potential life-or-death situation into something much, much more manageable. If you happen to experience a second ectopic, the unfortunate truth is that your are extremely likely to have another, but already being established with an EE may make you feel more comfortably exploring IVF if it comes to that, and hopefully it won’t. 

The only other thing I’ll say is that yes, IVF is daunting and scary. I remember grieving hard when we realized we’d need it. But if tubal factor is your only source of infertility, the chances of it working are actually excellent.

I was terrified to have it done but I knew it was the best decision out of the possibilities.  I had a panic attack while I was going under. Being in “THE operating room” and having them secure your arms to the table and shove a mask on your face that’s pressure-regulated so breathing feels like effort is absolutely terrible. 

The second time I was more mentally prepared for what was going to come. I was more upfront about the fact that I had anxiety and had a panic attack last time. When they put the mask on I knew I would hate it so I asked them to at least let me ‘fake’ holding it to my face so it didn’t feel like I was being smothered as much. I took long deep breaths and pulled faster than the machine could keep up to. I knocked out while explaining I was breathing to try to avoid the panic attack so it worked at least?

Waking up the first time was fine. The anaesthetic hangs around for a while making you feel very groggy, sore, and nauseous. “Down there” felt like it had been invaded, but not in a painful way? Just like someone had poked around in your insides, for obvious reasons haha. I had minor bleeding/ spotting which lasted for 4-5days.  By the time they wheeled me out of the recovery room and back to the normal ward where my husband was I was *amazed* how much better I felt. I could tell the infected goop of stuff was gone and my body was thrilled. Totally fine to walk around within 2ish hours of the procedure, when the anesthesia let me.  Chilled at home on the couch watching Netflix that day and the next. Fine after that. Had the week off work and would have physically been fine to go back after 3 days (if you sit around and take it easy). 

Second time I watched the clock. I was wheeled back into the room at 3:25. I was awake in recovery just after 4. I woke up so soon because my body decided I needed to violently vomit so I was jolted up suddenly.  I had been fasting for 16h by this point though so I just freaked out the nurses by yelling and dry-heaved into a bucket a few times. Not a nice way to wake up. Was more crampy and sore than the first time, but it wasn’t worse than a typical bout of mensural cramps.  Good to up and walk around shortly after. Say around that day watching TV, but made myself do errands,chores, and work around the house the next few days. Shouldn’t have done that. The crampy gross feeling persisted and it took a week or two to feel normal again. 

Both times they had a snack for me afterward and it was the best thing. Second time my hubby had a warm bagel waiting for me and I cried happy tears I was so hungry! (But you may also feel too nauseous to eat)

All in all, I would highly recommend it to anyone who is facing this terribleness as a quick-fix. Next time I’m going to try to take the pills at the first sign of MC to try and avoid getting a third. I have no noticeable scarring from the first two though.

I was terrified to have it done but I knew it was the best decision out of the possibilities.  I had a panic attack while I was going under. Being in “THE operating room” and having them secure your arms to the table and shove a mask on your face that’s pressure-regulated so breathing feels like effort is absolutely terrible. </p>

<p>The second time I was more mentally prepared for what was going to come. I was more upfront about the fact that I had anxiety and had a panic attack last time. When they put the mask on I knew I would hate it so I asked them to at least let me ‘fake’ holding it to my face so it didn’t feel like I was being smothered as much. I took long deep breaths and pulled faster than the machine could keep up to. I knocked out while explaining I was breathing to try to avoid the panic attack so it worked at least?</p>

<p>Waking up the first time was fine. The anaesthetic hangs around for a while making you feel very groggy, sore, and nauseous. “Down there” felt like it had been invaded, but not in a painful way? Just like someone had poked around in your insides, for obvious reasons haha. I had minor bleeding/ spotting which lasted for 4-5days.  By the time they wheeled me out of the recovery room and back to the normal ward where my husband was I was <em>amazed</em> how much better I felt. I could tell the infected goop of stuff was gone and my body was thrilled. Totally fine to walk around within 2ish hours of the procedure, when the anesthesia let me.  Chilled at home on the couch watching Netflix that day and the next. Fine after that. Had the week off work and would have physically been fine to go back after 3 days (if you sit around and take it easy). </p>

My D&C in February this year was relatively easy, even though it was probably one of the most emotional events of my life. 

I found out the baby didn’t have a heart beat at 9 weeks (measuring only a day off on the ultrasound at 8+6) on a Friday, so I scheduled the procedure for the next Friday, when I didn’t have work and my husband had to teach only one class. 

I had two or three appointments that week while waiting for Friday’s appointment, and my entire doctor’s office treated me with such great care. They did some of the medical intake stuff for me at the office instead of going to the hospital earlier and arranged for other parts to be done on the phone because my husband and I had such a busy week before Friday. 

My procedure was scheduled around lunch on Friday, so he taught his classes then met me in the car, and we went to the hospital. Intake was easy, and I met some of the funniest, sweetest, silliest nurses. They kept me laughing, despite my tears, and it helped me get my mind off of what was happening. I’m forever grateful for them. 

My doctor was a little delayed but the nurses did everything to help get my mind off of things. My husband waited with me the whole time, and he’d squeeze my hand every time I got overwhelmed with emotion. 

I read as many stories about procedures the night and week before, but I swore to pick up my phone and not reddit the day of because I found some things very triggering of my anxiety. 

My doctor came in briefly, and talked to me again and asked for any questions. When it was time, the surgery nurses (more serious, but very nice) put the IV in my arm, I told my husband goodbye, and I was out before getting in the room. 

Next thing I know, I woke up in the recovery, and they had my husband there waiting for me to wake up. My doctor may have stopped by to give me a hug before taking off, but I don’t remember. I was soooo groggy. 

I was given my own room again for about an hour, and I had to change the dressing. There was a good bit of bleeding, but not the same amount as after having a baby— about 1/3 of the mess. 

We drove home, and I saw the doctor on Monday, and she checked my hormones 3 times that week. We were given the okay to try again after my first cycle. (Just one menstration is enough— so after the bleeding stops from the procedure, even if it’s a week later, you bleed again, I was given the green light to start trying again). [[ETA: My cycle started about 3 weeks later and I ovulated about 5 weeks after the D&C. I thought it was 4&6, but I must have bled again about a week after my cycle started.]]

The after bleeding was super minimal for me, but I wore a pad because it would suddenly become heavier after only have a very light flow for days. 

I took off of work on Monday and Tuesday while my husband was out of town for a work thing, and I had my parents there to help with my toddler. I cried a lot, but not as much as I did the week before. I could have gone  to work like normal, but I had job interviews going on that week and I didn’t want to drive across my busy city, especially at night for one job, by myself when I was so prone to getting overwhelmed and crying. 

My husband and I were numb for about 2 weeks after, then things went back to a new normal. I’m still dealing with some anxiety and emotion from that loss, but it’s so different now. 

I told one boss, but not the other, since I’m super close to one after working for/with her for years. I also didn’t want my fertility to be a factor in not finding full time work after graduation, so I didn’t tell my close friend coworkers who are prone to talk with others in our department. And I didn’t tell my new boss at my part-time job at the time. 

We hadn’t told anyone outside of my parents that we were pregnant yet— I was waiting til after that first ultrasound— so I only told about 9 people what was happening, including one boss and one friend at work. Obviously, my parents knew since they were there taking care of my kiddo, and I told two cousins who miscarried two weeks before.  I also told my mother-in-law and my sis-in-law. I also told a friend who I knew was planning to start trying with her husband. 

I now talk about it all the time because I don’t want it to be something with a big stigma. At the time, though, I didn’t want to NOT get a job because I was actively trying to expand my family. It feels weirdly selfish to have done that, but I tried to do what’s best for my family so I try not to feel guilty about it. Now it’s obvious we’re actively expanding my family, I feel like I can be less guarded with that information. 

If you want/need any advice: you do what’s best for you at any moment of this process. It’s super emotional, and taxing on your body since many of the hormone withdrawals are similar to post partum ones. Some people will check on you while others may ghost (TTC friend kinda did), and that’s okay since they’re trying to do what’s best for them, too.

<p>My D&amp;C in February this year was relatively easy, even though it was probably one of the most emotional events of my life. </p>

<p>I found out the baby didn’t have a heart beat at 9 weeks (measuring only a day off on the ultrasound at 8+6) on a Friday, so I scheduled the procedure for the next Friday, when I didn’t have work and my husband had to teach only one class. </p>

<p>I had two or three appointments that week while waiting for Friday’s appointment, and my entire doctor’s office treated me with such great care. They did some of the medical intake stuff for me at the office instead of going to the hospital earlier and arranged for other parts to be done on the phone because my husband and I had such a busy week before Friday. </p>

<p>My procedure was scheduled around lunch on Friday, so he taught his classes then met me in the car, and we went to the hospital. Intake was easy, and I met some of the funniest, sweetest, silliest nurses. They kept me laughing, despite my tears, and it helped me get my mind off of what was happening. I’m forever grateful for them. </p>

Still not sure about the distinction). 

My biggest recommendation is to ask questions at every juncture you can to help you understand what is going on and help reduce your anxiety. The procedure itself is very safe, fast (like... 10 mins long), and low-risk. I had mine done in a hospital OR by my OB. I arrived and checked in, and was taken to the prep area which was a bunch of small rooms with upright hospital beds in them. First they took my vitals, asked health history questions, I got undressed into the gown, things like that. Then I had different people come to see me one by one. My husband was with me for all of this. 

First, my OB came by and he told me a bit about the procedure. He went over the risks with me and then answered all of my questions. A little while later, the anesthesiologist came to see me and told me what kind of sedation I'd be getting. I had twilight sedation and he told me what I could expect to experience and how the sedation works. Then, the OR charge nurse (I think?) came to see me and she was like, my main point contact. She told me her job was to keep me safe, and that was great to hear and she was so calm and reassuring. I wondered if she herself had had a miscarriage or a loss because she was so compassionate and just knew all the right things to say. I'm in a teaching hospital and my OB is the attending, so then two medical students came by to introduce themselves and tell me they would be shadowing and watching my OB. One was really nice and one was obviously brand new and uncomfortable and unsure what to say. I just ignored her, lol. Finally, a nurse came to start my IV line, and that was the last visitor before it was time to go. 

My husband was allowed to stay with me all the way up to the doors of the operating room. We kissed goodbye and they wheeled me in. Since I was in a hospital it was very much like a typical OR. Lots of folks in the room but it was reassuring to see my nurse and the nice medical student, who talked to me as they got me situated on the bed. Then they started the sedation, and it just felt like falling asleep. That was all I remember. The next thing I was aware of was being in the recovery room with the nurse who did my IV. She gave me crackers and water and went over post op instructions with me. My husband was allowed back into recovery with me as soon as I woke up. He said it was so fast. We were probably in recovery for less than an hour before they let me go home. 

My recovery has been really easy. I had a D&C about 12 years ago and I remember recovery being harder after that one. Maybe I knew what to expect or because I've been through a c-section now... I'm not sure. It is having a surgery so expect soreness, a little difficulty walking especially upstairs, cramping and stuff for the first day. You just want to take it easy. I spent the day lying on the couch eating cereal, watching Friends. I also had a low grade fever (still do, actually) which felt a little funky the first night. By the second day, I was feeling a lot better physically. By the third day, almost back to normal. My post-op bleeding was minimal.

Best of luck to you. It was, for me, an easy procedure but still sad. It was sad to think I was going to be no longer pregnant when I woke up, even though my babies weren't alive anymore.

When I got there with my husband, we waited in the waiting room for a short while after signing paperwork and then I was led into the recovery room.

I went in around 2, walking with my IV pole to the OR, and getting onto the table/bed.

I grew up in an upper Midwestern town where pretty much everyone was raised Christian, and a lot of my friends in high school had gone to a Catholic school through middle school.  I understand how people in settings like that feel entitled/empowered to say cruel things to people who deviate from their norms--particularly in circumstances like TFMRs.  I personally find it to be a double standard--but the most important thing is doing whatever is best for your own healing.

We live in a more tolerant community now, and even then my bereavement counselor was very cautious about me trying the support group, because not all of the patients she'd seen who'd gone through TFMR's had had good experiences there.  She encouraged me to go to one of the TFMR support groups in the region, but those would have been a 3-4 hr round trip to attend, so I opted to try our general perinatal loss group.  

It helped for me to contact the coordinator of our chapter, and talk about my concerns before going.  At our meeting, the facilitators start by reading some ""ground rules"" which include creating a supportive setting for all types of loss, ways of grieving, etc. and at least when I was attending, other couples were respectful of that.  

Sometimes I was the only one attending with a TFMR loss.  Sometimes there was another couple or another facilitator in attendance who'd gone through a TFMR, and it helped to have someone else there who'd gone through the same thing.  

Overall my experience was good---and TBH, having a few religious people in my group treat the TFMR families with the same sympathy and compassion as everyone else helped me feel better--even if I knew that not every observant person would share their compassion.  One of the observant couples lost their son in the NICU, and I felt like they understood our decision, in part because they knew what their son had gone through in the weeks he lived--and they appreciated what we'd spared our son better than we could.  

But I can't promise you'd have an experience like that.  When I started, I was prepared for the possibility it might not go well.  I was like, ""I'll try once, and if it's bad, I won't go again.""  My husband went with me, so I wasn't alone.  Same for the other TFMR couples.  

It would be completely understandable, though, if you decided you'd prefer not to risk it, too.  I stepped away from Facebook after my loss, but several people here pointed me to  [Ending a Wanted Pregnancy's](https://endingawantedpregnancy.com/) private Facebook support group as another option. 

Our hospital gave us  [*A Time to Decide A Time to Heal*](https://www.amazon.com/Time-Decide-Heal-Difficult-Decisions/dp/1878526391), and our library had [*The Prenatal Bombshell*](https://www.amazon.com/Prenatal-Bombshell-Continuing-Pregnancy-Diagnosis-ebook/dp/B00Y2A3JXE). Both are helpful, non-judgmental guides for navigating this type of loss. The former is a short quick read that my husband and I did together. The latter is a more detailed book that covers everything including TFMR, perinatal hospice, having a child with disabilities, and what comes after these things.  

There aren't a lot of TFMR moms super active on TTCAL right now--especially since the ""Alumni"" were forked to their own subreddit--but they came out of the woodwork for me when I made an introduction post.  If/when you're ready to share more, we'll be here...  <3",[],,t1_e410qwa,False,0,[],False,"<div class=""md""><p>Yes, it&#39;s definitely a real concern.  I grew up in an upper Midwestern town where pretty much everyone was raised Christian, and a lot of my friends in high school had gone to a Catholic school through middle school.  I understand how people in settings like that feel entitled/empowered to say cruel things to people who deviate from their norms--particularly in circumstances like TFMRs.  I personally find it to be a double standard--but the most important thing is doing whatever is best for your own healing.</p>

<p>We live in a more tolerant community now, and even then my bereavement counselor was very cautious about me trying the support group, because not all of the patients she&#39;d seen who&#39;d gone through TFMR&#39;s had had good experiences there.  She encouraged me to go to one of the TFMR support groups in the region, but those would have been a 3-4 hr round trip to attend, so I opted to try our general perinatal loss group.  </p>

<p>It helped for me to contact the coordinator of our chapter, and talk about my concerns before going.  At our meeting, the facilitators start by reading some &quot;ground rules&quot; which include creating a supportive setting for all types of loss, ways of grieving, etc. and at least when I was attending, other couples were respectful of that.  </p>

<p>Sometimes I was the only one attending with a TFMR loss.  Sometimes there was another couple or another facilitator in attendance who&#39;d gone through a TFMR, and it helped to have someone else there who&#39;d gone through the same thing.  </p>

<p>Overall my experience was good---and TBH, having a few religious people in my group treat the TFMR families with the same sympathy and compassion as everyone else helped me feel better--even if I knew that not every observant person would share their compassion.  One of the observant couples lost their son in the NICU, and I felt like they understood our decision, in part because they knew what their son had gone through in the weeks he lived--and they appreciated what we&#39;d spared our son better than we could.  </p>

<p>But I can&#39;t promise you&#39;d have an experience like that.  When I started, I was prepared for the possibility it might not go well.  I was like, &quot;I&#39;ll try once, and if it&#39;s bad, I won&#39;t go again.&quot;  My husband went with me, so I wasn&#39;t alone.  Same for the other TFMR couples.  </p>

<p>It would be completely understandable, though, if you decided you&#39;d prefer not to risk it, too.  I stepped away from Facebook after my loss, but several people here pointed me to  <a href=""https://endingawantedpregnancy.com/"">Ending a Wanted Pregnancy&#39;s</a> private Facebook support group as another option. </p>

<p>Our hospital gave us  <a href=""https://www.amazon.com/Time-Decide-Heal-Difficult-Decisions/dp/1878526391""><em>A Time to Decide A Time to Heal</em></a>, and our library had <a href=""https://www.amazon.com/Prenatal-Bombshell-Continuing-Pregnancy-Diagnosis-ebook/dp/B00Y2A3JXE""><em>The Prenatal Bombshell</em></a>.

The son I lost had a genetic disorder, but not an aneuploidy.  So ""rare autosomal trisomies"" like T16 and T2 are at the fringe of my knowledge.  

I have read a little about them though (biomedical peer reviewed journal articles)--and what I've read isn't entirely consistent with e.g. what's on Wikipedia for T16.  Not sure if the discrepancies are because the Wikipedia entry's sources are almost all from >10 yrs ago, and the science has advanced, or what.  I won't get into the details of what differed--I'll just say that you're probably going to get better information from a genetic counselor/medical geneticist/MFM.  

In most cases, whether it's Trisomy 21 (Down Syndrome) or a rare trisomy like T16 or T2, it's not inherited.  It's generally due to one extra chromosome getting ""left behind"" in the egg, when the egg is maturing.  Because it happens in the egg, every cell in the baby (and placenta) will have the trisomy.  But it doesn't mean that *all* of the mother's eggs will be affected.  The recurrence of a trisomy depends on how good the cellular machinery is at not ""leaving behind"" extra chromosomes.  (E.g. As a woman ages, the cellular machinery performs less well.)

In some cases, a trisomy is found to be mosaic (again this could be something more common like T21 or T18, or rare like T16 or T2).  That means that it's not found in every cell of the baby.  This happens when, early in embryo development, the embryonic stem cells are dividing, and during that process, an extra chromosome gets ""left behind"".  Then any tissues that that stem cell develops into will have the trisomy.  

Because the baby has some cells with a ""normal"" number of e.g. chromosome #2, doctors know that the extra chromosome didn't originate with mom or dad--it originated *in* baby.  That's why mosaic trisomies are described as ""not inherited.""  

Because full or mosaic trisomies are both unique to the egg cell (full trisomy) or baby (mosaic trisomy), it also means that if your triplets weren't identical triplets, there's a good chance only your little boy had these trisomies.   If they *were* identical triplets, they likely all carried T16 (because the all came from the same egg).  They may also have all had mosaic T2--that would depend on whether the trisomy in the stem cell arose very early (before the individual triplets were formed) or later, after your little boy was his own entity.  The placenta(s) can also be informative, but testing those separately depends on factors like amount of tissue, gestational age, etc.

It sounds like you have some good questions.  When we went to our medical geneticist appointment, I wrote a whole list of questions, so I wouldn't forget anything (and could write down any answers I wanted to).

It feels like the universe is playing a cruel joke and not giving me a break to heal. I don’t know what the solution is but I’m really sorry you’re going through this. It’s so hard. I’m going to try to be more selfish and make sure I’m taking care of me first, I think I’ve been trying to act like everything is ok and that’s obviously not working. Sending you love!</p>

A few days ago I checked my bumper group's discussions and bang two more are pregnant again. I haven't had any negative feelings towards pregnant women after my MMC, but seeing pictures of two tests with two lines in a row was literally like a punch in the gut. I'm not sure how I feel about it all. I'm very happy for them, and to be fair, I got pregnant before them and they might have felt the same way when I announced to the group. It just sucks so much to have an MMC and then what, somewhat irrationally at cycle 2, feels like a decline in fertility. 

I was so hopeful last month and getting that BFN was so disappointing.  I vowed I wouldn't let myself get my hopes up this time, but here I am smiling because I'm symptom spotting. I ovulated late (CD18 late, not CD164 late) this cycle, so I'm only 8 DPO now and won't be testing until at least 10DPO. I've never tested before 12DPO when getting positives, but I'm thinking if I've gotten positives on 12DPO on 25mIU/ml sensitivity tests, technically I could get a BFP on 10DPO on 10mIU/ml sensitivity tests...Inventing reasons why I would be allowed to test before 12DPO...

I also keep feeling phantom kicks, like constantly. I would be 23 weeks now if I hadn't miscarried and when I feel the ""kicks"" for a fraction of a second I find myself thinking ""Perhaps I didn't miscarry. Maybe I'm actually still pregnant. Maybe someone made a mistake."" Until  I remember all the blood and the pain.

<p>Anyway...they told me I could start ttc after my next period. I have a mix of feelings of wanting to be pregnant right away because I SHOULD be right now, and worried that I&#39;ll feel like I&#39;m just replacing her, and worried I&#39;ll just be terrified the whole time that something will go wrong again.</p>

<p>Also three of my friends had due dates within a week of me, and one with the same due date.... I don&#39;t want it to make me jealous or sad. But around the end of November they&#39;ll all have their babies and I won&#39;t.</p>

I know that&#39;s unlikely as I&#39;m young and otherwise healthy...but this tiny voice in the back of my head says over and over again &quot;it just may never happen!&quot;  Has anyone else felt that way? 😔 </p>

<p>After nine months you&#39;d think you&#39;d learn how to not want it so badly buuuut that&#39;s just not the case. </p>

I really think this stems from the fact that losses aren&#39;t really talked about/ normalized in popular culture. People are clueless about the pain and sadness that can come with any kind of loss. </p>

It feels so unfair. And then I feel guilty for being upset about my cat when I just lost a baby, but I didn’t know my son for 7 years, I never got the chance to forge a connection with him. She’s just a cat, but she’s so much more than that, too. </p>

<p>Other friendships that also seemed over turned out to just be “on hold”. I recently met up with a friend I haven’t seen in a full year and we picked up right where we left off. That was a sign that this was a friendship, unlike the others, that is worth putting time into. </p>

My husband actually won in a claw machine for once and I said I wanted to save it for Squish. We don&#39;t have a picture from our scan but my mom took a brief video before she saw the doctor&#39;s face so I&#39;d like to take a screenshot and print out a photo to stick in there too. </p>

<p>I&#39;m cramping from my d&amp;c and sticking that box in our closet was the most heartbreaking thing I&#39;ve ever done. </p>

<p>But I&#39;m trying to be positive. We should be able to try again in October/November (doctor said to wait two cycles) and I look forward to the day we have a rainbow baby. For now we&#39;re going to work on making some lifestyle changes (eating healthier, exercising, working on spending habits) and we&#39;ll be going on a much needed vacation in September for our anniversary. I can enjoy wine with dinner while on vacation and that&#39;ll be nice :) and we can relax in the hot tub at our hotel. We have some extra time to find a new place (looking to move from a 2 bed/1 bath to a 3 bed/2 bath). Everything is hurting but I also feel motivated to make the best of things and make good choices for the children we will have someday.</p>
