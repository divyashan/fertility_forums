Of course we’re a little stress: OPKs, tempting, TWW, timed intercourse…  all of it it’s exhausting. But let’s be honest, people get pregnant and have healthy pregnancies in stressing situations: not only wars, women that suffer domestic abuse, or even normal women with stressing jobs or that they have to deal with difficult situations, just think about nurses.

My hope is that you will find resilience to experience this grief while also finding joy in other things in your life. Becoming a mom requires so much resilience, and it only gets harder when you actually become one. Parenthood can be such a mixed bag, and you are going to need the resilience to find things to be thankful for and enjoy the small moments even when you're going through something really difficult.

Stress doesn't do anything good for your body on a day-to-day basis. Maybe stress is useful if you need to lift a small car off of someone, but generally stress ages you and makes normal function difficult for all the systems in your body. That being said, lots of women get pregnant and have healthy babies, despite being under extreme stress. 

I personally want to have as little stress and drama in my life as possible. I am naturally a calm, easy going person, and that totally disappears when I get stressed and I turn into a controlling, anxious person. After a cancer scare, repeated losses, losing my dog, and several medical emergencies in my immediate family, I went months without feeling a single day of calm. I started therapy for intrusive thoughts (like why me? what did I do to cause all of this calamity? everything in my life is shit and I don't want to live on this planet anymore) and it helped some. I still wasn't back to me though. I reached out to old, old friends while simultaneously fading away from current friendships. I started working out more, and I started a ton of new activities trying to find a way to channel my stress and anxiety into something so I could go back to being me. And I explained all of this to my regular doctor (DO-- different approach than MD), and I told him I felt like I was grasping at straw to try to find a way back to how I was before the dumpster fire that was 2016. 

And in the middle of 2017, that DO offered me the most ridiculous solution-- a probiotic. He specifically recommend the Align brand as he had seen studies showing that the ingredients in this particular brand reduced anxiety in the people who took it. I am a huge skeptic and I hate taking medications, but I had even tried acupuncture for my stress and anxiety, so taking an expensive little pill seemed okay. After about a month of taking it, I noticed that I started to ""not care"" when things happened. IUI#2 failed? Eh. We'll try again in a month or two. IUI#4 failed? Well, let's figure out how to liquidate our assets to pay for IVF. 

You have to do what works for you, and don't accept that chronic stress is just who you are now. We've been continually dealing with infertility and multiple losses for years now. I tried therapy, exercise, crafting, dog training, hiking, video games, new books, new music, acupuncture, getting a new puppy (WHICH DID NOT HELP!), switching up the people in my life, and when I piled the probiotic on top of all these other things, I finally got back to me. I still have moments of stress and anxiety-- like anyone with a boss, loved ones, or fertility issues, but the difference is that I can experience the stress and the anxiety for an hour or a day, but the ""what if"" thoughts don't rattle around in my head non-stop for months upon months.

Keep at it-- try everything! Get a piece of jewelry or something to remember your lost little one by. Maybe a necklace or a bracelet that you can wear every day in remembrance. Maybe don't get a puppy, though.",[],,t1_e17xq7w,0,False,"<div class=""md""><p>I&#39;m sorry that the people in your life have made you feel like you need to be over your very recent loss.

I had a stillbirth at 40 weeks last September. We also opted for the autopsy. Waiting for the results was horrible. The preliminary results didn't show anything, but a few weeks later the brain results showed some abnormalities. My OB didn't know how to interpret the results, so he consulted a pediatric neurologist and we had to wait to hear back from them. Ultimately, their best guess is that ~33 weeks baby had had a stroke or cord event that caused damage. Everything looked normal up until my due date when my water broke and we went in and they couldn't find a heartbeat. 

We decided to have her cremated and my husband and I spread her ashes at a park where we had taken many walks during my pregnancy. We did not have any kind of event for friends and family. 

It may seem odd, but we did not name her. We had had a name picked out, but that name carried so much meaning for her future and place in our family that it no longer felt right, not ever getting to meet her. I still worry about being judged for that choice, but it was the right thing for us. 

The logistics and phone calls were so hard, especially talking to the funeral home. This group has helped so much, just to know we're not alone in our experience. For my IRL people, I quickly figured out who I did and didn't want to talk to. It wasn't always who I expected. Some people just ""get it"". Usually it's those who have been through some kind of loss or trauma. My husband and I process things differently. I have to talk things out and he's often my sounding board. He went and built us a fence (it was something that had needed to be done). Having a physical distraction was good for him. We both needed to have some distraction. 

Slowly, there came days when I didn't cry. Then weeks later I could occasionally forget. Now, months later I can talk about most of the details without crying. I have seen a counselor who specializes in perinatal mental health and I think it has helped some. Mostly just to tell my story and hear that what I'm feeling is normal. Otherwise, just time. The sharpness of the sadness and anger has dulled. The anger more slowly, though. If my grief had a mantra it would be, ""This isn't fair."" I've said it so many times. I know life isn't fair, but it still sucks.

Also, be aware that delivering a stillborn child (labor/delivery/postpartum/etc.) can be traumatic in its own right, separate from the grief and sadness of your loss. 

I hope you and your partner are able to find some peace in this difficult time.",[],,t1_e16xk9b,0,False,"<div class=""md""><p>I&#39;m so sorry for your loss. I had a stillbirth at 40 weeks last September. We also opted for the autopsy. Waiting for the results was horrible. The preliminary results didn&#39;t show anything, but a few weeks later the brain results showed some abnormalities. My OB didn&#39;t know how to interpret the results, so he consulted a pediatric neurologist and we had to wait to hear back from them. Ultimately, their best guess is that ~33 weeks baby had had a stroke or cord event that caused damage. Everything looked normal up until my due date when my water broke and we went in and they couldn&#39;t find a heartbeat. </p>

<p>We decided to have her cremated and my husband and I spread her ashes at a park where we had taken many walks during my pregnancy. We did not have any kind of event for friends and family. </p>

<p>It may seem odd, but we did not name her. We had had a name picked out, but that name carried so much meaning for her future and place in our family that it no longer felt right, not ever getting to meet her. I still worry about being judged for that choice, but it was the right thing for us. </p>

<p>The logistics and phone calls were so hard, especially talking to the funeral home. This group has helped so much, just to know we&#39;re not alone in our experience. For my IRL people, I quickly figured out who I did and didn&#39;t want to talk to. It wasn&#39;t always who I expected. Some people just &quot;get it&quot;. Usually it&#39;s those who have been through some kind of loss or trauma. My husband and I process things differently. I have to talk things out and he&#39;s often my sounding board.

I’m sorry you lost him. 
I am hoping they find something in my blood tests, they took 12 pots when I went into hospital. I was already taking 75mg if aspirin daily as I have had 2 previous miscarriages and they said it was to lower my risk of another. 
My mum and I have been looking at coffins today, as they gave us a booklet at the appointment we had. We have got it down to two to choose from, so will ask my boyfriend his advice when I see him tomorrow as he wanted a day to himself today.. he is an introvert and I think me being super needy the last few weeks has been quite draining for him.

We will too ensure that (if we are lucky enough) to have children that they know About Aneira and how precious she was. 
I honestly don’t think still birth and miscarriages are discussed openly enough. I am proud of Aneira and want to share her with the world. Yes it’s been crap, and yes I may get upset when I talk about her but that’s only because I couldn’t show her how much I loved her.

I was in a similar situation where George's heart just stopped beating. There were some signs of issues with the placenta (clotting inside), but the post-mortem investigations couldn't give us a definitive answer why he died, other than a lack of oxygen. No cord issues or anything like that. They did find out I have a fairly common blood clotting gene mutation called Factor V Leiden, which requires daily blood thinning injections and aspirin in any future pregnancy. I would recommend getting tested for blood clotting issues yourself, just as a precaution. My sister in law lost her first baby at 26 weeks and they believe she had a similar blood clotting issue. 

We decided to have a funeral for George and had him cremated. We had a humanist ceremony as we're not religious. We had someone come to our house to discuss what we wanted him to say and go through what would happen at the ceremony. We chose a few songs (intro song as we walked in, a reflection song part way through and one to walk out to). It was only brief, around 20 minutes. We only invited immediate family members. It was definitely the right thing for us to do and helped bring closure. Seeing his tiny white casket with his name engraved on the front was traumatic, but we felt we honoured his short life well. 

As for afterwards... It's been a year since we lost him. I've had plenty of therapy sessions with a lady who had a lot of experience with those who've had pregnancy losses at different stages. It helped to discuss how I was feeling with someone impartial and really let everything out. 

Otherwise, we just had to let time pass by. The pain doesn't ever go away, but you find a new ""normal"" and ways of living with the grief. The pain for me isn't as raw as it was. I've mostly accepted everything that's happened and my brain doesn't scream at me as much that I have a dead baby and it's the end of the world. I love my little boy dearly, but he is gone and I can't bring him back. We'll bring George up in conversation quite regularly and we'll make sure any future children know about him when they're old enough.

I'm sorry there's nothing really specific there. I guess my main advice would be some kind of therapy, when you're ready (I didn't go until around 3 months post loss). It allowed me to recognise that I needed to be kinder to myself. None of it was my fault and I couldn't have loved or cared for him any differently.

We lost our baby girl at 28 weeks, however we were fortunate to have an answer- she had a knot in her cord. I cannot imagine the pain of not knowing. I am so sorry. 
We had literally no idea what to do when we found out that we had lost our baby, and that we would have to “do something”with her body. It’s such a shock to even contemplate on top of the grief you’re already experiencing. For us, we chose not to have any funeral or ceremony. It was such a private experience. Only our closest family members were involved and visited in the hospital and after we were home. We chose to have our baby girl cremated. We chose a funeral home near where we lived and just called them. Turns out many funeral homes will cremate babies for no cost. My husband made the phone calls. The funeral home picked her up from the hospital, and called us when the process was complete and she was ready to be brought home. I was in no state to do such things. 
We received her remains in a temporary container (a velvet bag- which initially made me freak out because it felt so crass,but eventually I became grateful for) until we had the mental capacity to decide what to do. Personally, we hated the idea of burying her because it felt so cold, and so distant. She is our baby and we wanted her near us. Other people have felt more comfortable having their baby buried. That is a very personal choice. 
We spent a looooong  time looking for the right urn. I honestly must have seen every infant urn on the internet. We eventually decided to have one custom made. We wanted something in our house to represent the joy and beauty of our little girl. Something to make us smile and remember her every day. It’s painful, but it also feels so nice to have our baby girl nearby, with her family. She now lives in a beautiful butterfly urn we have mounted on a wall. It’s beautiful, just like she was.
Please PM me if you want. I would so so highly recommend the folks who made our urn, if you’re interested.

I saw a post few weeks ago, where someone was complaining that pregnancy was the worst because on top of not being able to drink and eat sushi, at 6 months, she was forced to stop her crossfit and her 8 mile runs.  And she got a lot of commiseration.  And in my head, I was like, ""Dude! When I was almost 6 months, my baby DIED!  There are worse things than nine months without sushi, or 3 months without crossfit.""  I had near zero empathy. (But I kept my thoughts to myself.)

Some women get really angry about the fact that other women who aren't careful about their smoking or drinking, or have drug problems, or financial problems, still have healthy babies, while they ""did everything right"" and lost their baby.  The fact that women with those types of problems often have experienced other types of pain from early on in their lives (such that one would probably not want to trade places with them) doesn't really register or abate the anger/resentment.

And some people just have different baselines for anger.  Gender disappointment posts also trigger ""it could be so much worse"" reactions for me, but I don't fly into a rage and publicly declare I want to slice a woman's belly open.  (TBH, that sounds unhinged.)

That said, I have two thoughts on the questions you posed.  One: your ex-friend might need more/better support.  Specifically a therapist with experience in infertility + a TTC group for infertility (where people will be more sensitive about sharing triggering topics, and people who get pregnant move to a different group).  (Unplugging/taking a month off can also be helpful, but I probably wouldn't broach that with an ex-friend this volatile.)

Two: An interview I heard a decade ago really helped me through my loss.  The interviewee was a therapist who was quadriplegic.  And he was asked (paraphrasing), ""How can you listen to your clients' problems?  They must seem trivial to you, relative to your situation and what you've lost.""  And his response was, ""pain is pain.""  He might ""have it worse"", but that didn't mean his clients weren't in their own pain and didn't need help and compassion.

Was off Reddit for a week while we visited my side of the family. Met the niece that was my son's ""cousin twin"" (born a day before he was due). No tears or problems holding her, but not as happy an occasion as meeting her older sister was.  It's impossible not to think, ""that's how big he'd be now"", ""he'd be holding his head up and starting to turn on his side now"".  (He'd be 3 months today.)

Still the visit was a good for making time fly. Due to weather-related flight cancellations, we got back late, and my NIPT almost got pushed back to July(!).  But luckily, because of my history, they were able to reschedule for the next day instead.  

So I had my NIPT and genetic counseling appointment yesterday. Both of our former genetic counselors--including the one that worked with us after the CHD was diagnosed and we were referred for amnio--changed jobs, so this was a new person (#3). I'd expected it to be a quick review of previous NIPT and amnio stats, but instead it was more of a ""how are you doing?"" ""do you have support"" type meeting. There were tears.  Happens every time I talk about how we lost our son.  

But now this genetic counselor is now up to speed, and willing to be accommodating.  Last time, we didn't find out the gender, and then when the amnio results came back worse than we'd thought, we really wanted to know, so that we could spend the last days with our baby, knowing.  But we couldn't find out at that point.  

So this time, we asked if the genetic counselor could order the gender for the NIPT, but give us the results in a way that hides the gender results from us, but allows us to look at it later, if we need to.  (Yes, it's a little crazy.)  But she is happy to accommodate us.  She's also calling my husband when the results come in.  I do *not* want to get results over the phone call from the genetic counselor again.  (A poor NIPT result is the biggest risk for this baby.  Recurrence risk of my son's condition is lower.)

Otherwise, my only real ""symptom"" is some digestive upset. That's been getting better this past week. So feeling generally good. Next  week I have a check up (haven't heard the heartbeat since ~ 7wks). Just hoping baby is healthy.

Unfortunately, all TFMR or perinatal loss counselors near me don’t take my insurance.

I also couldn’t find any support groups near me (an hour without traffic but more like 2+ because there’s ALWAYS traffic) - we only have one car so it’s tough to make something work with both of our schedules. As I am typing this out, I almost feel like I’m making excuses to not go.

I planned this pregnancy to the T. I based it on my career progression and my projects at work. I’m a planner and I’m annoyingly anal about it. And I think this has a lot to do with my struggle of timelines with TTCAL. With this pregnancy, I literally planned it so that I would go on maternity 2.5 months post a project go live - enough buffer time in case it slipped and enough time to do a knowledge transfer. I know - I’m nuts. 

I am also in a male dominant industry and field. I feel like it’s a double edged sword to be good at your job and to have those relationships - for my organization, it means you are ‘rewarded’ with larger companywide initiatives. This is just an additional layer of unnecessary stress. You’re right though - my career will still be here when I come back. I have the support of my leadership team and some of them know what we have been through the last couple of months and it hasn’t changed the pace of which I am assigned to work and my career trajectory.

And because my husband and I are fortunate enough to make good salaries, I would be charged closer to $200/session on these counselors’ sliding scales. I also couldn’t find any support groups near me (an hour without traffic but more like 2+ because there’s ALWAYS traffic) - we only have one car so it’s tough to make something work with both of our schedules. As I am typing this out, I almost feel like I’m making excuses to not go.</p>

<p>I planned this pregnancy to the T. I based it on my career progression and my projects at work. I’m a planner and I’m annoyingly anal about it. And I think this has a lot to do with my struggle of timelines with TTCAL. With this pregnancy, I literally planned it so that I would go on maternity 2.5 months post a project go live - enough buffer time in case it slipped and enough time to do a knowledge transfer. I know - I’m nuts. </p>

<p>I am also in a male dominant industry and field. I feel like it’s a double edged sword to be good at your job and to have those relationships - for my organization, it means you are ‘rewarded’ with larger companywide initiatives. This is just an additional layer of unnecessary stress. You’re right though - my career will still be here when I come back. I have the support of my leadership team and some of them know what we have been through the last couple of months and it hasn’t changed the pace of which I am assigned to work and my career trajectory.</p>

The conflicted feelings you're experiencing--wanting to be pregnant again, wondering if it's too soon, fears for pregnancy after loss--are all really common.  (And not just for TFMR moms.) Everyone just needs to do what feels right for them.   

We were cleared to TTC again after 6 weeks by my doctor, but my husband thought we needed a little more time emotionally, so we waited a little longer.  And then my body wasn't back to its normal self, so our first attempt was probably anovulatory.  (But it's own crashing disappointment, nonetheless.)  

The TTC rollercoaster and the subsequent pregnancy fears got easier with time.  I saw a bereavement counselor and attended a parent support group for perinatal loss until about 6 months after my loss, and those things helped.  (Even when I thought I felt better, it helped to keep a standing appointment.)  I also liked the book *The Prenatal Bombshell* by Sherokee Ilse and Stephanie Azri. (Our library had it.) There are chapters about grieving, life, TTC, and pregnancy after loss. I found it to be pretty non-judgmental about what decision parents made after a tough prenatal diagnosis.  (Not just assuming or advocating one option.)  

Beyond those general things, one thing that helps me with anxiety is to not thing about the whole future and what could go wrong all at once.  We had a healthy anatomy scan at 20 weeks, and then got bad news at 21 weeks, and things snowballed from there.  So any subsequent pregnancies will have a lot hurdles to pass.  

It's overwhelming to think of everything at once, so I break it into chunks.  E.g. When TTC, I'm not going to worry about, e.g. the amnio.  TTC-time is time for TTC worries.  Miscarriage worries or NIPT worries or fetal echocardiogram worries, etc. can each stay in their own boxes.  They'll each have their time to be front and center...no need to shoulder everything all at once.

From what you're illustrating, I'd say CD 16 and 17 were both positive OPKs. It's hard to know exactly which day you ovulated if your thermometer broke, though. You can only really confirm ovulation after you get a temp spike. However, most women ovulate 12 to 72 hours after their LH surge (what you would have seen on the positive OPKs). So if today is CD 18, and that was negative, you have either already ovulated or you may ovulate in the next 48 hours.

The reality is that our babies are not here. I remember when my husband and I were driving home from the hospital after my D&E (I was 21 weeks) and I said to him ""The miracle never came. I thought something would happen to stop all this but it didn't"".

Every week I have a different way of working through the grief, this week I'm focusing on this idea:

We feel so much pain because we loved so strongly. Love and suffering go hand-in-hand. I loved Mabel so much and I would suffer again if I had to. If someone asked if I would like to have the memory of her pregnancy and loss erased - I would refuse. 

I'm going to try again, and I'm going to love again and if I suffer again, I'm going to suffer but I will suffer because I loved. 

That being said, everyone's situation is different. If I had been told that this was very likely to happen again, or that the likelihood of having a healthy pregnancy was low - I may choose a different path and have a different mindset.

Does that make sense? I am now a year and a half since we lost our baby girl and not a day goes by that I don’t think of her and miss her. The pain is still there - but I am better at managing my pain and grief. </p>

<p>As for trying again - that is such a personal decision and everyone is so very different. The fear of losing another baby weighed heavily on me when we were trying to decide what to do. I’m not sure that fear goes away either. </p>

""You'll get pregnant again right away."" I hate when people say this. It's invalidating, and it's also probably not true. They have no way of knowing.

My husband's other concern is that our cat won't be as happy as he is now. I agree that this is probably the case, and this is what usually stops me in my tracks. We tried to introduce a second cat last year (when we were initially told we would require IVF), and our cat was just so miserable. His unhappiness, and the fact that we ended up having to rehome cat #2 (who was just perfect and made me so incredibly happy), crushed me. Our cat would be much better with a dog (he tolerates my parents' dog just fine), but still...he clearly prefers to be king of the castle.

Anyway...I've basically told my husband that if we're still not pregnant by 2019, we'll revisit getting a dog. We'll be coming up on the anniversary of our daughter's death around then, and we'll have been trying to get pregnant again for almost a year, so that seems like a good time to take the plunge.

We tried to introduce a second cat last year (when we were initially told we would require IVF), and our cat was just so miserable. His unhappiness, and the fact that we ended up having to rehome cat #2 (who was just perfect and made me so incredibly happy), crushed me. Our cat would be much better with a dog (he tolerates my parents&#39; dog just fine), but still...he clearly prefers to be king of the castle.</p>

<p>Anyway...I&#39;ve basically told my husband that if we&#39;re still not pregnant by 2019, we&#39;ll revisit getting a dog. We&#39;ll be coming up on the anniversary of our daughter&#39;s death around then, and we&#39;ll have been trying to get pregnant again for almost a year, so that seems like a good time to take the plunge.</p>

<p>If you feel comfortable sharing a pic of your puppy some time, I&#39;d love to see her!</p>

More than anything, it saddens me to watch my last year of med school pass me by without being pregnant. The final year of med school is notoriously easy (""the most expensive vacation you'll ever take""). By contrast, the year after medical school (intern year) is the busiest in medical training. You easily work 80-100 hrs each week. We tried so hard to have a baby during this year--I never anticipated that it would be so hard to hit an 18-month window. But this upcoming month is the last month that can happen (if I get pregnant cycle 4, I'll be due in April, right at the very end of med school). It took 8 months for us to get pregnant the first time, so this likely won't happen. 

I'm mourning the loss of this last blissful year of free time. I thought I'd be able to spend it with my daughter, who was due in July. I really thought this would be one of the best years of my life. But now all this free time is just contributing to my overall feeling of emptiness. What a waste.

In the grand scheme of things, I'll be thrilled if I get pregnant at all. It feels awfully silly to be thinking about timing at all, now.

Today, I bring you: RETRO YOGA.

These brilliant videos were made circa 1995 by the power yoga master Bryan Kest. Here he is in all his glory, sepia-toned, shirtless, with denim cutoffs and flowing hair. And the rest of the people doing the yoga class are equally svelte. Incredible.

But the thing is, this is MY FAVORITE yoga to do. Ever. I’ve done his level 2 and 3 in this series countless times. It’s a great workout, and I feel more centered and at peace afterward.

Here’s level 3. I hope you all enjoy this as much as I do!

I had a case of sudden onset Pre-eclampsia and HELLP syndrome. I hadn’t had any issues during my whole pregnancy and then woke up one morning not feeling well. 12 hours later I was being prepped for my C-section. My daughter was born at 28 weeks. She would have survived, but shortly after birth we discovered she had a congenital heart defect. She passed away at 30 days when she became septic following heart surgery.

I did go on to have a normal full term pregnancy about 18 months after. I would recommend meeting with a High Risk OB prior to trying again. First of all, they did testing to rule out Lupus and other conditons that can cause HELLP. Secondly, they put together a plan for my OB to follow in any subsequent pregnancies. They also did testing to find out what my new base level of kidney and liver function was, so we could better monitor any decline. (I unfortunately discovered during this both my liver and kidneys were permanently compromised by the HELLP.)

My High Risk Pregnancy Plan included:
- Baby aspirin everyday until 30 weeks.
- Monitoring my blood pressure from home every day (twice daily) after 20 weeks. 
- Growth ultrasounds every 4 weeks after the 20 week ultrasound.
- Non-stress tests twice weekly after 32 weeks at a local hospital’s Antepartum department.
- Being on a modified bedrest starting in the third trimester. 

I also did things that probably wouldn’t be relevant in your case like, met with a neonatal cardiologist for heart sonograms and did additional genetic testing.

All of it was worth it, my daughter is safe, healthy and home. I wish I could say it lessens my grief but it doesn’t. I keep thinking how unfair it is she’ll never know her sister.

Please feel free to PM me if you have any other questions. I know how scary it can be to consider trying again after almost dying in childbirth.

^Actually, ^I ^just ^put ^on ^some ^bright ^fuschia ^lipstick ^and ^an ^all ^black ^workout ^outfit ^and ^did ^two ^of ^her ^workouts ^in ^my ^living ^room...

A couple notes/warnings:

1) The production quality of these videos is pretty low, and her husband seems to be the cameraman most of the time. Sometimes he makes weird/uncomfortable comments (like making a sexy growl). Which, together with the low production quality, gives a sort of American Apparel circa 2011. But the workouts are so good that it's worth it to me to ignore this when it comes up...And to be honest, part of me appreciates that he is so clearly turned on by her strength.

2) She had a baby some time in 2016. I've never seen her baby on her channel, but she appears pregnant in some videos (I avoid these), she sometimes references the baby (e.g., ""done with the workout just in time for the baby to wake up from his nap!""), and you can sometimes (rarely) hear the baby in the background.

Here are just a few of my favorites:
1) Killer low impact lower body workout (for when you want to be quiet for your downstairs neighbors or otherwise just don't feel like jumping around): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9G2L69q2epU&list=PLyHkPJN__Plq5iFLikUVC8azg2Qy8-1b-&index=10

2) Total body home workout (a bit easier than her other workouts--at least, of the ones I've done so far--but still a great challenge): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kxr_lKiaeac&index=20&list=PLyHkPJN__PlqWcsK9n9fd9inXLNtpcBho&t=387s

3) Ultimate body weight workout (for when I want something longer--this one is 30 minutes): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0qMCtAKxzQ&list=PLyHkPJN__PlqWcsK9n9fd9inXLNtpcBho&index=24

There are two reasons to test twice a day: 

1. Some women have a short LH (what OPKs measure) surge and you might miss your peak if you only test once a day.
2. Some women never peak in the morning/evening. If you're one of these women and don't know when you tend to peak...

Once you know your cycle and LH pattern better, it will be easier to pinpoint when you need to do OPKs and you won't need to use as many. I know I usually only get high or positive OPKs in the early afternoon (12\-2pm). Before someone told me to test at different times, I was just testing in the morning around 10am and never saw the faintest of lines. 

I'm a big fan of FertilityFriend (FF; the app), but I just started using Femometer as well this cycle because it has a neat feature where you can take a picture of your OPK and Femometer will give you a numerical value of how dark (low\-high\-peak) your test line is compared to the control so you don't need to guess anymore. They're both free apps. And I use the Femometer result in FF as if it was the reading from a digital OPK. 

If you're stressed because you feel like you want to know your body better, and not because this is ""too much"", I really recommend temping and FF. Temping might seem daunting at first, but it's the only way to know if you actually ovulate unless you have access to ultrasound during your fertile window. You can get positive OPKs but not ovulate and you wouldn't know if you don't temp. Temping gets really easy after just a few days.

While totally frustrating and emotionally difficult to go several cycles without a positive after loss, it’s totally normal, even if you’re doing everything right and your timing is perfect. It doesn’t mean you’re necessarily timing anything wrong, or that anything is wrong with you. It’s just the way it is unfortunately.  

Our GP actually said that she wasn’t inclined to send us to an RE until we had been trying a year after our first MC and actually used the words “secondary infertility” to describe what *would* be the case if that happened. 

OPKs - everyone is correct. They are negative until BOOM they’re positive - and then right back to negative. Sometimes my surge lasts 3 days. Sometimes just a few hours. Negative OPKs on CD13 are also totally normal. Keep testing and you’re likely to see a positive soon, depending on your cycle length. 

However - you don’t have to use them if they are stressing you out. If your cycles are regular, having sex every other day during the middle part of your cycle (like CD10 - CD20 if you’re on a 28 day cycle) will almost certainly hit the fertile period and give you great timing. We’re pretty busy and a bit low libido, so I like OPKs cause they help time things. But as I understand it, sex any of 0-3 - 0-1 have pretty similar odds, and if you hit one of those days, another day isn’t a lot more likely to get you pregnant. More important I think is the egg quality and other uncontrollable factors any given month.  ",[],,t1_e0n6qo6,0,False,"<div class=""md""><p>So a few things:</p>

I’m supposed to have one more blood draw a month after the first negative and my OBGYN wants me to go on HBC to prevent me from ovulating and growing another cyst. I figure my chances of success are so low now (statistically from miscarriage and reduced AMH from cystectomy) so why not. I don’t want to go on HBC before I see the RE because I’d like some testing done.</p>

<p>Most of all, I don’t want to be waiting anymore.</p>

I will go ahead and let you know what has worked for *me*, in case it works for you. Here’s my routine:
 
5-10 min before I plan to give myself the shot, I grab a small circular ice pack from the freezer and stick it on the spot where I’m going to inject. When I first started the shots I just went straight for it, and found (1) that shit burns, and (2) I bruised like crazy. Big large bruises. Icing helped. I did ice cubes in a bag for a few days, then realized I should just spend $10 and buy a pack of small reusable ice packs on Amazon. Worth every penny!

Once I’ve iced for a bit, I’ll go pick my spot and sit down (at first to avoid the aforementioned fainting, now just because it’s easier for me). 

Next I take off the ice pack (set it aside where it’s close at hand for later), and clean the area with an alcohol swab. I bought a pack of 200 alcohol swabs at the store for a few dollars. So much easier than cotton balls and rubbing alcohol. Still smell nasty but they get the job done!

I put a small washcloth on my lap—more on why I do this in a minute.

Then I open the single-use syringe package all the way. Don’t do what I did one time and open it partway then try to pull it out by the plunger side; that is a bad idea and I ended up losing like half my dose that night. 

Once you have the syringe out, hold it vertically with needle side down and tap a few times to get the air bubble up to the top near the plunger. Air bubble at the top helps make sure the medicine stays in you once you’ve injected. Also injecting the air bubble is ok and i believe recommended!

Ok, now take the needle cover off. When you do this you will have a few drops of medicine fall out! This is why I have the washcloth on my lap; I don’t like the med drips on my clothes but that is just me. If there is a drip hanging on the edge of the needle go ahead and tap the needle to get that off (it can burn more if you don’t). 

Injection time: grab a good chunk of skin and subcutaneous fat; don’t be shy! Instructions tell you to insert the needle at 90 degrees; you can do that or angle it a bit. I tend to do mine at more of a 45 degree angle. Start with the tip of the needle against your (numbed) skin and push gently. After a bit of resistance it will go in pretty easily. And now, start injecting. My recommendation is to go as slow as you possibly can. Lovenox burns like a mofo; the first one I did straight up fast and no ice felt a lot like a bee/wasp sting to me. The slower you go the less it may burn. I start pushing the plunger down slowly, then if I feel burning I pause until the burning stops, then keep going. It’s ok to take your time, it’s not about being fast it’s about getting the med in you! Push all the medicine in, you’ll hear and feel a little air gush when the air bubble goes in. Pull the needle out and you’re done! Hard part is over. With my syringes I keep pushing the plunger really hard and I get a loud pop then a safety tube pops over the needle. 

Lastly, I swipe again with the alcohol swab on the injection site (I do this to wipe away any tiny bit of medicine that oozes out, or if the site bled a bit to wipe the blood away). I then grab my ice pack and stick it back on the spot for a few minutes. Done! 


Sorry for the novel, just though I would pass along what has worked for me in case you find it useful. With this method I very rarely get a deep bruise, though I will still get lighter yellow bruises from time to time. Getting into a routine has helped me mentally too, and now it doesn’t phase me to give myself the shots. I don’t enjoy it, but at least I know I can get through it and it will be worth it in the end! Definitely feel free to reach out still; I know I struggled a bit at first and really couldn’t find anyone to answer my questions in real life, so I ended up scouring YouTube and reddit and pieced together suggestions into something that works for me. 

Good luck!! You’ll do great!

And lets be honest, some losses you just don&#39;t get over and shouldn&#39;t be expected to &quot;get over&quot;. The loss of a child is one of those things. </p>

<p>That&#39;s not to say that one is stuck sobbing and being sad forever. It just means that the sadness of our loss will be a companion to us, probably for a long time. And that&#39;s okay, I don&#39;t think I&#39;d want to forget completely of our pregnancies/losses, almost babies. </p>

<p>So... It&#39;s okay. It&#39;s okay to be sad. It&#39;s not steps backwards, it&#39;s just life with a big loss. </p>

I might start monitoring my temperature but I’m concerned that I’ll get obsessed with it and don’t know if it’s worth it. Good luck for you and your husband!</p>

On the other hand, that isn't acceptable behavior regardless of the situation. I'm now terrified that we'll have to put him down eventually because of aggressive behavior. He's high-energy and we've had a trainer come out before to help; and he bit the trainer while the trainer was doing a 'personality assessment', aka grabbed his belly without notice. These are the only two incidents so far (we got him at 10 months, he's now a little over 3 years) but I couldn't live with myself if there are more, and more severe, injuries.

Everyone is going to be different.  How much of what you're experiencing is physical recovery + healthy grief response vs. depression is hard to say.  

I will say that I found the grieving and crying very tiring.  The first week after my loss, my husband and I stayed home.  So if I needed to sleep in or take a nap, I could.   Even when I wasn't crying every day anymore, I still seemed to need at least an hour more sleep than what I've needed for years.  

People heal, physically and mentally, at different paces.  If it's only been a week since your MC, I don't think this shift is necessarily something to worry about.  

But if you have a past history of depression, it doesn't hurt to set yourself up with support early--your regular therapist, and if they don't have experience with pregnancy loss, perhaps a second therapist who does.

I don’t know about your partner, but here’s my take on the situation.

When a man loses a baby in miscarriage, his involvement in the situation is that he had an orgasm (which probably felt great), and then he didn’t really have to deal with any of the physical after effects. Seeing what your wife has to go through physically in miscarriage when all you had to do was orgasm is a source of guilt for many many many men. On my men’s miscarriage group, many men struggle with feelings of guilt after miscarriage because they feel that without them causing the pregnancy, their wives or girlfriends wouldn’t have had to endure that. This feeling of being the reason your wife was hurt is not very sexy.

People claim men shut down after miscarriage, which perhaps is true. But contrary to the popular narrative that it’s because men don’t care, I think it’s because men are dealing with feelings of guilt and no one wants to deal with guilt head on. Hence, we turn to distraction, over optimism, or something else as a way of assuaging that irrational guilt. 

None of this justifies your boyfriends behavior of course. What he did was well beyond what most men would do, but there’s a good chance his behavior is an unhealthy reaction to his own feelings.

Anybody, ever. In realms related to babies or not.   And it&#39;s easy to compare ourselves with others. Obviously we could compare ourselves with those who easily get and stay pregnant. We also could compare ourselves to women who wanted to had kids but never met the right partner, could never afford IVF, or who had to get a hysterectomy because of cancer.  We&#39;re still here, we still have options and partners and ovaries, and hope is still there.   </p>

<p>I guess I&#39;m in a hopeful moment because I&#39;m also trying to tell all of this to myself. Please forgive me if this sounds naive. But there&#39;s still hope.   Hang in there.</p>

What the hell? At 23, my wife and I were making well into the six figures between the two of us (DINK engineers), had a great apartment, health insurance, etc. We were perfectly ready for our first baby. Our income is literally worse now mainly because of our miscarriages (wife decided to stay home to deal with pregnancy).

<p>What the hell? At 23, my wife and I were making well into the six figures between the two of us (DINK engineers), had a great apartment, health insurance, etc. We were perfectly ready for our first baby. Our income is literally worse now mainly because of our miscarriages (wife decided to stay home to deal with pregnancy).</p>

- One of our friends has PCOS and struggled to get pregnant with her second.  She needed medications and was put on a highly restrictive diet.  It still took them more than a year to conceive.  When you try a new treatment, and it doesn't work the first month, it's a big disappointment.  But it doesn't mean you should give up right away.
- Surgery always comes with risk (and recovery time).  It's not unreasonable to try a less invasive approach first.  
- That being said, a few women here had more serious issues (e.g. Asherman's), and benefited from trusting their intuition that something more serious was wrong.  Other women here have had procedures to evaluate things like blockages and scarring, and could better speak to how those concerns are assessed.

My biggest point of frustration with this is that no one really seems to care about this on a medical level.

Talking to the OBGYN before surgery she suggested checking my thyroid and ferritin levels, as well as taking baby aspirin daily (done, done, and was doing). Beyond that it’s not really worth working up further since there is still a good chance I’ll go on to having a normal pregnancy.

The fertility place we went was basically willing to test whatever we asked, and insurance coverer testing. Good luck dear. I hope you get good information. A lot of male factor issues can be approved by lifestyle changes.</p>

Recurrent cysts/cysts that don&#39;t resolve sounds like a different issue from e.g. PCOS.  But the people who deal with things like PCOS at least have some specialized knowledge of cyst physiology and how it relates to pregnancy.  And, of course, they may have seen cases like yours as well (because people get referred to specialists for all sorts of reasons).  </p>

<p>I would not just get a second opinion--I might even ask <em>that</em> specialist if they would recommend anyone in your area with more experience handling your issues.  </p>

<p>With the PMP recovery + cysts, you might need more help and interventions navigating this than average.  But you also have some things in your favor (you&#39;re 33, you ovulate, you can get pregnant), and it seems like if you investigate your options now, while those things are in your favor, there might be more things the RE&#39;s can offer...  </p>

I went 2 days early for a post-op appointment today because I have an itchy bumpy rash on and around my incisions. OBGYN said she has never seen this reaction before.

Good news, pathology for the cyst came back normal. No cancer there. Had my blood drawn to test hCG again today for the partial molar.

Now for the TTC conversation. When my hCG comes back as normal, she wants me to go on the birth control pill to keep me from ovulating. If I don’t want to do this, she advises I go to a fertility specialist for a second opinion.

At this point I’m so beaten down and my abdomen is covered in surgical scars. Taking the pill and not having to worry about trips to the ER, surgeries, and mounting medical bills sounds tempting. Except for the childless part, that sounds miserable.

I&#39;m positive about this cycle but I don&#39;t know if that&#39;s good or not - it&#39;s hard to choose between being skeptical and then less disappointed if it actually works, versus being hopeful and then crushed if it doesn&#39;t. </p>

<p>Any advice on how to just dial it back a little? I&#39;ve got a slow-ish job so most of my &#39;thinking time&#39; is during the day. We do home improvements projects on nights and weekends so when I have something else to think about, I obsess just a little less. </p>

I'm active in several subreddits so I might be more used to hopping back and forth between subreddits than other people are, so I admit that for me multiple subs really isn't a big change. There are several ways to view multiple subreddits on one page, if that would help.

As for progesterone during your cycle, most doctors want to see a 10 on 7dpo (naturally) or a 15 if on fertility meds. So 9.5 is actually pretty decent. You would need to have it checked multiple cycles to see if there is an issue with progesterone. BUT -- the research is definitely not conclusive regarding progesterone.

What seems to be the biggest conclusion is that low 7dpo progesterone may mean the ovulation was poor/the egg quality wasn't great. But that isn't for sure, either. If you are found to have low P on numerous cycles, some doctors will suggest clomid/femara to try to help the ovulation. OR doctors will put you on progesterone supplements after ovulation. But with a 9.5 you likely don't need either.

Also, if you're 10dpo and haven't started your period, your luteal phase is just fine. 

Spotting is quite common, or ""normal"" -- I rarely use that term regarding fertility anymore because every body is so different. I actually did seem to have bad egg quality/poor progesterone, but I didn't ever spot pre-period. This is why fertility studies are SO hard.

Feeling overwhelmed and resentful makes sense -- pregnancy loss is bullshit and really messes with your mind. Its hard to trust your body again afterwards!  And its frustrating to not know what will happen in the future -- its a big loss of control.
