(Lineporn: <a href=""https://www.reddit.com/r/TFABLinePorn/comments/ec3mzb/frer_12_dpo_do_you_see_what_i_see_is_this_an/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf"">https://www.reddit.com/r/TFABLinePorn/comments/ec3mzb/frer_12_dpo_do_you_see_what_i_see_is_this_an/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf</a>)</p>

<p>But this morning it‚Äôs a blazing white BFN, and I‚Äôm at 13 dpo, so i think it‚Äôs way too late to expect a positive to show up at this point.</p>

<p>My chart is all kinds of crazy. Temp is on its way up again. My LP last cycle was 11 dpo, so I‚Äôm totally lost at what‚Äôs happening. </p>

<p>Update: I got a few BFPs 12-13dpo, but AF came today. Chemical pregnancy</p>

Your post hit home with me a bit. When we lost our baby, my FIL was a complete jerk to me. Asked me why I named my baby, why I brought her ashes home. Completely unsupportive of my grief.

<p>Cycle 4 just seems so much more than 2 or 3 (and I don‚Äôt mean to be insensitive to others trying longer than I have been, I know 4 is still quite early!) and as much as I told myself it could take up to a year, I guess deep down I expected to be pregnant by now. </p>

<p>I just want a baby belly. I want the nausea and the fatigue and the sleepless nights. I want a long labour and a dramatic delivery and a baby in my arms. My baby. </p>

<p>I by no means want to offend anyone, just needed to get some things off my chest.</p>

Based on my positive pregnancy test date, I also know when I ovulated due to the Mira device, there is no way I would be at 6 weeks currently.</p>

<p>The ER OB doc would not officially tell me I was miscarrying because the 2 ultrasounds were too close together. I have an appointment this Friday to officially confirm it, and then get the pill if I need it.</p>

<p>I am sorry I can‚Äôt give you hope. But I know too much about medicine to have any hope in my situation. I still have all my pregnancy symptoms; fatigue, sore breasts, increased appetite.</p>

<p>I do wish you the  best though, I really hope you have a better outcome than me.</p>

I am so sorry you went through this. 
I see your post is 66 days old, but I have just been through the same thing two days ago, and I‚Äôve been looking for women who experienced the same thing, since it‚Äôs rare that hospitals let us deliver/miscarry at home so late in pregnancy.  We lost a much wanted child in a horrible way because of a doctors incompetence. 

In my case it was also an emergency resident doctor that sent me home mid-miscarriage without any information, pain killers or anything, really.  She insured me I wouldn‚Äôt be able to see it was a fetus and it would just be a clot I would flush out. That the pain would be like a heavy period. Both you and me know that‚Äôs a lie. My water broke, I had contractions for 8 hours and I had to yank the cord out myself since it was stuck. Most horrible experience of my life.  The doctor didn‚Äôt know that at my hospital, if the fetus is measured over 8 full weeks you have to be in the hospital when it happens. 

I was 13 weeks along and fetus was measured at 10 weeks by the doctor, but when I had delivered it was clearly much bigger than that. I had to look since I had to push it out and it landed on the floor, so I had to pick it up, and I could hold it in my hand. 

I so so so wish I didn‚Äôt have to do that because I see the images every time I close my eyes. I think you choose wisely by not looking. It was not a peaceful goodbye for me to see the remains of that should have been our child.

I definitely understand your desire for having a baby.

I want to have another child so badly my body aches, but I'm also terrified of losing a fourth child. 

My suggestion is to talk to your husband. Ask for specifics on why he doesn't want to try again. After he answers ask of there is anything that would make him open to trying again. Maybe he will feel more open to the idea after running some tests. Maybe he just needs a bit more time.

I got married at 24 and started trying right away. over the next 5 or 6 years i had 3 miscarriages. had no idea why my body was doing this. i had given up the idea of having biological kids. all my miscarriage happened between 4 and 6 weeks. 

my husband and i started classes for foster to adopt life was moving on. i realized one day my period was late so i took an old test, it was like 2 years old. it was positive and i thought it had to be wrong since it was so old. i went to my doctor and i was pregnant, just over 6 weeks. he did some tests and it turned out my progesterone was low so my body couldn‚Äôt sustain a pregnancy. i started taking pills and seeing the doctors every other week. everything was going great. we passed the dreaded first trimester with everything being perfect. 

i went to see a MFM doctor for at my 23rd week and he discovered my cervix was open and my sac was bulging and sent me straight to L&D to see my regular doctor. i was told i would have to be on bedrest in the hospital for the rest of the pregnancy. but sadly 4 days later my water broke. there was no way to stop the labor and my doctor  said the longer we waited the higher the chances for an infection. i had to decide if i wanted to wait as long as i could to try and reach the age of viability, so another week or 2, which wasn‚Äôt really an option as i was in labor and according to my doctor i was already showing signs of infection, or if i wanted to get a shot to make labor faster. i had to decide to get the shot to speed up labor. i didn‚Äôt want to die of infection or mess up the chances of having more kids. it was the hardest thing i have ever done. my son, Zechariah, was born 24 hours later. he was born alive but because he was under 24 weeks the doctors did not want to intervene, nor were they required by law. so 34 mins after he was born he passed away in my arms. 

i have incompetent cervix. usually not diagnosed until it‚Äôs too late. i learned a lot after this and felt my doctor didn‚Äôt explain to me what was going on, or help keep me pregnant longer. so i switched doctors because now i knew i needed progesterone to get past the first trimester, and i needed a cerclage to stop my cervix from opening. it took 8 months to see the new doctor because she was very sought after, i also saw an endocrinologist to help get me pregnant. by an act of god i got pregnant 2 weeks before my first appt with the new doctor, i told her at the consultation i thought i was and to please give me progesterone until we knew for sure, and she did. i had an appt with her every other week and one with the MFM doc every other week. so from the time we knew i was pregnant until i went into labor i saw a doctor ever week. i had my son at 35 weeks. he‚Äôs 3 1/2 now. 

i wish you luck, and send love. if you or anyone reading this has questions, feel free to ask here or pm me. it‚Äôs been a little over 5 years since we lost our son and i have learned a lot about infertility and what to ask and how to up the chances of getting pregnant. i was 38 when i had my son, i had GD, i was on bed rest for the last 6 weeks. we will not be able to have more children. but that‚Äôs okay. we have our 2 sons, one my be gone but he‚Äôs still my son. i often think of the 3 miscarriages as well. for me the loss wasn‚Äôt as traumatic, although please don‚Äôt get me wrong it still hurts my heart and a loss at any age is still a loss, but for me personally the circumstances of their losses are easier to live day to day with. i hope this comes across the right way.",[],,t1_fai0pg9,False,0,[],False,"<div class=""md""><p>First off, i am sorry for your losses. it‚Äôs very hard and my heart goes out to you and your family. </p>

I recently had my 6th loss.

Quick rundown of the losses for background info.

1. Heart stopped at 10+4, we found out the next day, there was no known reason, D&C, no testing
2. Heart stopped at 7+4, found out at 10+3, D&C with testing, no abnormalities found
3. Chemical pregnancy - loss at 4+5
4. Chemical pregnancy - a loss at 5 weeks
5. Ectopic pregnancy, took weeks to diagnose and had a D&C to be sure because we couldn't find it...then I took methotrexate
6. Chemical pregnancy - loss at 5+2

After loss #2, I was getting some general, early testing from my OB but then I quickly had loss #3. I then went to a RE for more testing and help. I had TONS of tests and we never found a ""reason"" that we could pin. Unfortunately, 75%+ of recurrent loss is unexplained.¬†

Clotting and Thyroid issues are the top 2 reasons for recurrent loss. There are tons of tests to check for these.¬†

I always suggest, at a minimum:

* CD3 testing followed up with surge testing to compare the results (and this should be LH, Estradiol, and FSH)
* General thyroid testing - and this should be **T3, T4, TSH, and T3RU** (all of these aren't usually done)
* **Thyroid peroxidase antibody (TPO)** test. Many doctors won't do this if the others come back normal, but TPO can still be elevated and cause issues.¬†
* Prolactin¬†
* Factor V Leiden Mutation - for clotting (2nd most common inherited thrombophilia in the US)
* Progesterone testing (cycle day 21 blood test) on multiple cycles. This test is done at 7 Days Post Ovulation (CD21 for the average cycle) to see if you ovulated. You want a level of 10 on an unmedicated cycle. If its lower than that, its harder for implantation to succeed.

To go further than that, I'd suggest:

* Karyotyping for both (so glad your doing this!)
* Insulin -- being resistant to insulin may increase miscarriage risk
* Hgb A1c and Estim Ave Glucose (eAG) - blood sugar
* Factor II (Prothrombin) -- clotting
* Anti-Beta 2 Glycoprotein -- for clotting
* Anticardiolipin Ab -- for clotting
* Lupas Anticoagulant Comp -- for clotting¬†
* Homocysteine¬† -- for clotting
* Dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) - Sulfate -- too high can prevent implantation

Some others you might as well test:

* Vitamin D
* Vitamin B12/Folates (anemia)
* Ferritin¬† (iron) 

&#x200B;

For NON-bloodwork testing:

* Sonohysterogram or Hysterosalpinogram

Here‚Äôs my lengthy story:

I found out around 23 weeks that my son, Ronan, had a severe type of a disorder called Osteogenesis Imperfecta. It‚Äôs more commonly called Brittle Bone Disease/Disorder. Had an amnio to try to pinpoint exactly what type it was as there are around 8 known/categorized types. The mutation he had was one the lab had never seen before. Neither my husband nor I were carriers so Ronan just won a 1 in 50kish lottery during conception. Based on how he looked in utero, they determined he either had Type II, which is the most severe and more often than not, lethal. Or, he had Type III which was the the next worse option. He would never walk. He would be so fragile that sneezing or coughing could break ribs. He had dwarfism, so he would be about the size of a toddler or small child his entire life. BUT, people with Type III go on to live fulfilling lives despite those odds. I went to high school with a guy who had Type III and he works for the city helping to improve accessibility. Ronan wouldn‚Äôt be as limited as he would have been years ago.

I carried him until 39 weeks when I went in for a c-section, the safest option for him. He‚Äôd already broken many bones in utero, so we wanted to limit any more breaks if possible. As soon as he came out, I knew without seeing him. I think I‚Äôd known for a while and like any mother, hoped I was wrong. He just had so many odds stacked against him. 

He had Type II. He was textbook for it, honestly. Essentially, his rib cage was too small and his ribs had grown straight rather than curved as they normally do. This caused his lungs to be underdeveloped. He was placed on a c-pap to give us some time with him. We had to make some really hard decisions that day. He was a fighter. After he got to the point where the c-pap was doing next to nothing for him, we had them remove it. We thought he would pass pretty quickly after that. We were wrong. He fought for about 5 hours to stay with us before he finally went to sleep. 

He was born September 3rd, 2019 at 1:25pm and passed September 4th, 2019 at around 12:40am.

I try to be positive every so often and post a thread hoping for my beautiful people here to have a good day. But other than that honestly when I start talking about my experience I get very sad and I cry a lot.

I am on fertility drugs. I have pcos, without my metformin and actos I don't ovulate at all, with them I only ovulate every 50 days or so. My RE has me on the highest dose of Femara and I ovulate roughly CD 16-18 on it. Today is CD 15 so I know it will be soon.

Im really frustrated with my ob. He is a high risk ob, he has a specialized interest in pcos. But when I asked for the heparin prescription (that my hematologist suggested) last time he just said ""oh well let's see how your hcg goes""

What if the baby needed the heparin? Or just progesterone? My prog is always low and I've begged him to just let me have progesterone but he won't let me do anything without strong betas.

Im just like ffs I've lost 6 pregnancies can we not just try random shit at this point???

So like I said I'm going to see about seeing the other RE in my area. It's a day trip, but I don't understand why my current RE both wants to follow my pregnancies to 12 weeks but also doesn't want to do anything to help them get there and just tells me to listen to my ob. 

It just sucks being rural cause my ob is the only high risk one within like 70 miles. But I don't even care I'm so tired of no one but me wanting to help my babies live.

RE did try clomid first but I'm resistant. Even with highest dose I did not ovulate. Femara does work and he thinks my issue may be egg quality but that's literally all he wants to do. He isn't even testing  my egg quality. He just thinks my miscarriages are bad egg quality but he's never even checked my fsh.

We have to save up some money because we don't have infertility coverage but I just want to at least talk to the other RE close to us because I just think my current doctors aren't doing enough. If I'm willing to try just let me have the shots, even if it doesn't work at least we tried.",[],,t1_faghvgu,False,0,[],False,"<div class=""md""><p>To be fair I don&#39;t share a lot here.

Supplementing progesterone is done a lot, but most studies prove it is not helpful and all 3 REs I've worked with don't do it. Low progesterone is believed to be a symptom of the loss, not the cause. Also, it can prolong a pregnancy that is already ending/has ended, which isn't ideal. Have you had low progesterone in pregnancy and/or in your cycles when you didn't conceive?

Im just trying to do my best and get through the next two weeks until the holidays. I just keep trying to take the day in 30 min increments. Hang in there.</p>

I still go back to it. The original post is from reddit. Hang in there. I'm here for you. *hugs*

As for grief, you'll find it comes in waves. When the ship is first wrecked, you're drowning, with wreckage all around you. Everything floating around you reminds you of the beauty and the magnificence of the ship that was, and is no more. And all you can do is float. You find some piece of the wreckage and you hang on for a while. Maybe it's some physical thing. Maybe it's a happy memory or a photograph. Maybe it's a person who is also floating. For a while, all you can do is float. Stay alive.
In the beginning, the waves are 100 feet tall and crash over you without mercy. They come 10 seconds apart and don't even give you time to catch your breath. All you can do is hang on and float. After a while, maybe weeks, maybe months, you'll find the waves are still 100 feet tall, but they come further apart. When they come, they still crash all over you and wipe you out. But in between, you can breathe, you can function. You never know what's going to trigger the grief. It might be a song, a picture, a street intersection, the smell of a cup of coffee. It can be just about anything...and the wave comes crashing. But in between waves, there is life.
Somewhere down the line, and it's different for everybody, you find that the waves are only 80 feet tall. Or 50 feet tall. And while they still come, they come further apart. You can see them coming. An anniversary, a birthday, or Christmas, or landing at O'Hare. You can see it coming, for the most part, and prepare yourself. And when it washes over you, you know that somehow you will, again, come out the other side. Soaking wet, sputtering, still hanging on to some tiny piece of the wreckage, but you'll come out.
Take it from an old guy. The waves never stop coming, and somehow you don't really want them to. But you learn that you'll survive them. And other waves will come. And you'll survive them too. If you're lucky, you'll have lots of scars from lots of loves. And lots of shipwrecks.‚Äù",[],,t1_fa0n55k,False,0,[],True,"<div class=""md""><p>This is a poem someone sent to me when we were drowning. I still go back to it. The original post is from reddit.

Hi everyone, this is also my intro post since I‚Äôve been lurking awhile but not feeling up to posting. Reading all your posts has helped me over the last few weeks to feel less alone so thank you. 

This was my first pregnancy and my husband and I were so happy. At 12 weeks the ultrasound tech saw a black area in the abdomen but my obgyn said it was probably just a problem with the machine so we didn‚Äôt think much more about it. At 15 weeks our baby was diagnosed with a congenital diaphragmatic hernia. Further ultrasounds showed it was not on the severe end of the scale so we got our hopes back up. At my ultrasound at 21 weeks we found out our baby boy was measuring weeks behind, was missing part of his brain and had something wrong with his heart. We made the heartbreaking decision to terminate. I gave birth to my beautiful baby boy, Gabriel, at 24 weeks. 

I had known for 2 months that there was a strong likelihood I would not get to take my baby home and I thought those would be the worst two months of my life just not knowing and waiting and feeling my baby move. Now it just feel like we keep getting bad things piled on us. As in we decided to have the memorial through the hospital but we‚Äôre not told anything except by our therapist who was shocked we hadn‚Äôt heard anything because they happen at the end of every month so we think we might have missed it which is horrible. They seem to have also lost our ‚Äòfamily book‚Äô (it‚Äôs a French legal thing) which we had given to get our baby‚Äôs name and birth details filled in. Also 2 weeks after I had given birth a close friend that I work with, who knew my entire journey, told me she just got a positive pregnancy test and that she was going to leave work straight away because it will kill her if the stressful situation at work harmed the health of her baby which started me blaming myself for what happened to my boy even though, of course, there‚Äôs nothing I could have done/not done. It was so insensitive of her, I let announcing her pregnancy slide because it can feel lonely living in a foreign country and I remember that when I saw my positive I felt happy but also a bit scared and isolated so I understand her need to tell someone.

I have 3 healthy boys (praise God) and was just pregnant with my little girl who, for all we knew, was healthy until she passed suddenly.

I just had my post op appointment today with my midwife (D and E on 11/22) and she just told us we ""should"" wait a cycle for dating purposes, but certainly can and should try after that if we want to.

She said something that resonated and I've asked others and they say the same. No matter when we decide to have another one, it's always going to be super stressful during the first weeks when we're unsure if everything is going well because we can't feel baby etc. It's so true. She also offered to give me extra check ups and ultrasounds if I want/need next time to ease my mind.

I'm fortunate to be very healthy myself. I'm not on any meds, I don't have medical conditions (other than being 36) I am not overweight etc, but I still worry, same as you.

The therapist yesterday said it's important to recognize what we have control of (diet, exercise, getting good sleep, destressing etc) and what we don't (random occurrences of miscarriage etc.) That does help. It's no use worrying over things that are out of our control. As hard as that is to accept, why worry over something that's going to be no matter if we worry or not? I'm trying to keep telling myself that and coaching myself in that.

I have 3 healthy boys (praise God) and was just pregnant with my little girl who, for all we knew, was healthy until she passed suddenly.</p>

<p>I just had my post op appointment today with my midwife (D and E on 11/22) and she just told us we &quot;should&quot; wait a cycle for dating purposes, but certainly can and should try after that if we want to.</p>

<p>She said something that resonated and I&#39;ve asked others and they say the same. No matter when we decide to have another one, it&#39;s always going to be super stressful during the first weeks when we&#39;re unsure if everything is going well because we can&#39;t feel baby etc. It&#39;s so true. She also offered to give me extra check ups and ultrasounds if I want/need next time to ease my mind.</p>

<p>I&#39;m fortunate to be very healthy myself. I&#39;m not on any meds, I don&#39;t have medical conditions (other than being 36) I am not overweight etc, but I still worry, same as you.</p>

<p>The therapist yesterday said it&#39;s important to recognize what we have control of (diet, exercise, getting good sleep, destressing etc) and what we don&#39;t (random occurrences of miscarriage etc.) That does help. It&#39;s no use worrying over things that are out of our control. As hard as that is to accept, why worry over something that&#39;s going to be no matter if we worry or not? I&#39;m trying to keep telling myself that and coaching myself in that. I&#39;m still very very early in my grief journey with my loss, but I&#39;m hopeful I&#39;ll be able to move past and trust that the next pregnancy will be uneventful like the first 3 were.</p>

I got pregnant our first cycle after getting my IUD removed in June. On Nov 6 at 21.3 I was admitted to the hospital after high blood pressure readings, proteinuria, and elevated liver enzymes discovered at a routine prenatal visit.  After several emotionally agonizing days and a diagnosis of preeclampsia and severe IUGR, instead of carrying as long as possible and waiting for my health to deteriorate, we decided to terminate.  We made that decision 4 weeks ago tonight and terminated at 21.5, the last legal day to do so in our state (though the MFMs who were monitoring me at the hospital assured me that they would not let my preeclampsia progress to severe HELLP or eclampsia even if we continued the pregnancy - mom's life trumps baby's in my state).

We're waiting the 3 months recommended by MFM before trying again.  My health has stabilized (I just got the go-ahead to drop my BP med!) and emotionally my husband and I are doing okay after the loss of our daughter.

<p>I got pregnant our first cycle after getting my IUD removed in June. On Nov 6 at 21.3 I was admitted to the hospital after high blood pressure readings, proteinuria, and elevated liver enzymes discovered at a routine prenatal visit.  After several emotionally agonizing days and a diagnosis of preeclampsia and severe IUGR, instead of carrying as long as possible and waiting for my health to deteriorate, we decided to terminate.  We made that decision 4 weeks ago tonight and terminated at 21.5, the last legal day to do so in our state (though the MFMs who were monitoring me at the hospital assured me that they would not let my preeclampsia progress to severe HELLP or eclampsia even if we continued the pregnancy - mom&#39;s life trumps baby&#39;s in my state).</p>

<p>We&#39;re waiting the 3 months recommended by MFM before trying again.  My health has stabilized (I just got the go-ahead to drop my BP med!) and emotionally my husband and I are doing okay after the loss of our daughter.  We named her Jane and have talked pretty openly and publicly with friends and family in person, and to some extent (without explicitly mentioning termination), on social media.  Jane was our first pregnancy and child.</p>

<p>While I&#39;m not ready yet (still not allowed to have sex yet - I chose to labor after a KCL injection so we could see Jane and hold her so need to wait 6 weeks) to start trying, I&#39;m confident I will be ready in a few months.

I just want to tell you that I'm so sorry for your losses, I just had 2 CPs in a row on cycle 2 and 3 of TTC  #1 and I can't even imagine what you're going through. In case this helps, here's what I'm planning on doing if I hit my 3rd CP/early miscarriage (I'm in Canada too so yay for free healthcare but nay for the waiting time):

I already have my referral from a generalist to go see an OBGYN in a maternity clinic, my trick was to look into maternity clinics who have OBGYNs that do other things than just follow ups on pregnancies (it's usually listed on their website if they have one). I think it's worth seeing one while you wait to at least try to get some basic testing done.The wait is more bearable (2 months approx.) so I sent my referral towards the end of nov (after my 2nd CP) and they told me that they will call me in Dec. for an appointment in Feb. This helps me to cope with the situation because I know I have a back up plan in case I keep trying for 1-2 months that might end up with another CP.

*I live in Montreal btw so if you need to come to the city to see an RE faster, I'll be more than happy to host you! Feel free to DM me!

But then they almost immediately start missing the kid! I want to experience that whirlwind because I think it will increase my appreciation for life and my capacity for joy.</p>

I'm now 12 days out from finding out our daughter passed. It's so hard. I feel like I'm isolating myself, but trying not to. It's just so hard when everything seems to make me cry and miss her more. The fact that I had to have a D&E because she was measuring 13w was even harder, maybe? IDK I guess it would be super hard to pass her on my own. I didn't want to do that.

I miss her with every fiber of my soul. I have 3 boys, who I love SO much. She was going to be my last baby (2nd with my husband) and my only girl. I was so so excited to have a girl. I'm hoping my rainbow is a girl also. I just feel so empty and I keep picturing my husband holding his sweet baby daughter and it breaks me.

At first, the thought of trying again was horrific. I couldn't picture doing this again. The waiting and anxiety in early pregnancy is bad enough when you haven't had a loss. But, we got several signs and we feel pushed to try again. I'm researching how to restore my physical health, egg health, and mental health to be prepared. I'd love to welcome a healthy baby in 2020.

I have my post op appointment Thursday morning. When I had the ultrasound that confirmed she was gone, I didn't ask for a picture. My midwife said there is one on file she can give me. I want it but don't at the same time. My poor sweet Felicity. There was no sign of anything wrong and her NIPT was fine. We didn't pursue further genetics.

Anyway, I guess I'm just writing for the sake of writing. I'm anxious to start trying again but feel like I need to wait till I have a proper period to begin trying.

I will see what the midwife says on Thursday about it all. Initially she said to wait till after I have a cycle, so I assume that would be the first time I have a period after the D&amp;E.</p>

The first thing my doctor did was trying to get all the tests in a line ‚Äî blood tests like nobody‚Äôs business, an HSG (where they stick a camera up through your cervix to look at your Fallopian tubes), and my hubby had to go do a sperm analysis. My HSG came back with a blocked tube, so she referred me to an infertility specialist to wrangle the rest of the results and see where to go from there. The clinic doing my husband‚Äôs analysis was AWFUL about sending his results, so while we chased those down, the specialist performed another HSG to see if the blockage was a cramp in the initial test (it wasn‚Äôt, but he managed to pry it open), a saline sonogram to see if there were any issues with my uterus, and more bloodwork. About that time, hubby‚Äôs tests came back pretty low. (Long story short, sperms have a lot to do with sleep quality and he had just been diagnosed with severe sleep apnea and gotten a CPAP coincidentally.) The specialist said we could start IUI immediately, but hubs & I wanted to give it a few cycles naturally with 2 open tubes & him breathing regularly we start. 

My biggest shock in the whole process was how extensive infertility testing is for the woman and how simple it is for the man. I mean, I‚Äôd rather do the extra work for tests than have to jack off in a clinic, so I didn‚Äôt complain too much. It was just unexpected how uneven it felt with time off work, procedures, etc.

Hope this helps. You‚Äôre welcome to PM me if you have any questions or anything. I know the ladies who coached me through the process & let me know what to expect were what gave me strength. üíúüíú Good luck, OP.

Most recommend waiting for a period and the reason is usually for dating purposes. There‚Äôs no evidence to show either way what is right or wrong for you personally.

I kept waiting for my period to come but then started noticing signs of of fertility (increased CM) the same week my hcg was 27.

It‚Äôs horrible, I felt like I was blindly going through this experience too and just had to google a bunch, I‚Äôm still on google (and here) trying to figure shit out.</p>

I've had 3 miscarriages now (from 4 pregnancies): one miscarriage at 9.5wk (stopped growing at 8wks), then had our daughter (now 3), then I've had 2 more miscarriages this year - a complete MC at 9.5wks and a MMC at 10.5wks (growth stopped at 8.5wks).

I keep getting told by doctors it's just bad luck and that because I've had one successful pregnancy that my chances of having another is good, but I'm highly suspicious it's the adenomyosis causing problems.

Before the first pregnancy I was starting to get fairly painful periods, after I had my daughter they've been much worse and heavier, and I can tell my uterus is bulkier and putting some pressure on my bladder. I'm pretty worried now that it's worse that it's going to be even harder to carry to term, and now I'm 38 I'm starting to get other factors working against me.

Any time I've asked a doctor about it in regards to the miscarriages they just shrug their shoulders, which is incredibly frustrating that nobody takes it seriously considering the papers I've read about it adversely affecting live birth rates.

My OB hinted very strongly at it but she‚Äôs an OB, so not exactly her area of expertise. My anxiety ‚Äúquirk,‚Äù I guess you might call it, is obsessing over this imaginary timeline of my life.

I had four losses before the diagnosis and one more since then. 

It‚Äôs especially shitty because doctors don‚Äôt seem to know as much about this condition and how it relates to infertility because it was previously associated with older women with multiple children, go figure. 

In addition to the losses, it‚Äôs possible that adeno had affected our ability to get pregnant because there were a few years between our third and fourth losses. 

After our most recent loss, the plan we made with our RE is to continue ttc at home and use 400mg of progesterone/day starting 3dpo. I‚Äôm taking prenatals and additional vitamin D. I‚Äôve been on an anti-inflammatory diet (no dairy, gluten, refined sugar, caffeine, alcohol, or fried foods) and have been avoiding additional estrogens (soy, non-organic meats, certain beauty products) as adeno is an estrogen-fed condition. 

My RE thinks the best chance of bringing a baby home is IVF with PGS and several months of down-regulating with Lupron (GnRH-a) before transfer. Lupron will block estrogen production and essentially induce menopause which in theory will settle down the adeno inflammation, or at least not allow it to get worse, giving us a better chance of a healthy pregnancy.

Best wishes!",[],,t1_f92fzrb,False,0,[],False,"<div class=""md""><p>I was diagnosed with suspected adenomyosis after a saline ultrasound earlier this year. I had four losses before the diagnosis and one more since then. </p>

<p>It‚Äôs especially shitty because doctors don‚Äôt seem to know as much about this condition and how it relates to infertility because it was previously associated with older women with multiple children, go figure. </p>

<p>In addition to the losses, it‚Äôs possible that adeno had affected our ability to get pregnant because there were a few years between our third and fourth losses. </p>

<p>After our most recent loss, the plan we made with our RE is to continue ttc at home and use 400mg of progesterone/day starting 3dpo. I‚Äôm taking prenatals and additional vitamin D. I‚Äôve been on an anti-inflammatory diet (no dairy, gluten, refined sugar, caffeine, alcohol, or fried foods) and have been avoiding additional estrogens (soy, non-organic meats, certain beauty products) as adeno is an estrogen-fed condition. </p>

<p>My RE thinks the best chance of bringing a baby home is IVF with PGS and several months of down-regulating with Lupron (GnRH-a) before transfer. Lupron will block estrogen production and essentially induce menopause which in theory will settle down the adeno inflammation, or at least not allow it to get worse, giving us a better chance of a healthy pregnancy. </p>

My husband and I had seven losses, 1st and 2nd trimester, before conceiving our surviving daughter, now 11 months. We are really hoping to conceive again in the next 6 months. 

I've been pretty surprised by my optimism. I think the biggest source of my hope is that obviously I am capable of growing a healthy living baby. I was so afraid that it wasn't possible for me when we were last TTC. We had one specialist tell us it wasn't possible and even though four others disagreed, it stuck with me and I was so afraid she was right.

My pregnancy with our surviving daughter was the first where we tried lovenox, so I am also hopeful that we have found our problem and know how to fix it. We recently met with a new OB (we moved away from my last OB, who we loved) and will be meeting with a new MFM soon to get a plan in place. Knowing that I will have a prescription for lovenox at the pharmacy just waiting to be filled is a huge weight off my mind.

I know life doesn't come with guarantees and I am sure I will be fearful after I get a positive test. When we met with the new doctor I also asked about extra monitoring and ultrasounds, how they handle losses, etc. Realistically, I think we will likely experience at least one more loss - we'd love to have 4 living kids, so the stats are not in our favor even if our risk is ""normal"" once I'm taking lovenox. I am really hoping that any future losses will be early though. I think I could handle it if we had a few chemical pregnancies in between healthy pregnancies, but I can't imagine another 2nd trimester loss. But then after every loss I've said I couldn't imagine surviving another one, and here I am...
