I had an extremely similar experience, and I was in that same limbo for a long time.

I had a MMC in February, and my doctor's office was, on the whole TERRIBLE about it. Before I was diagnosed MMC, I had a nurse call who assumed I had already miscarried, and she canceled my future appointment. Because of that, even though I already knew what it meant, I almost didn't even get told I was having a miscarriage until I demanded to see the doctor. And then when I finally did see someone, they didn't give me any of the management options at all, and basically said ""We'll intervene if we have to, but we would rather you just wait it out."" It was awful! 

BUT that aside: Even though I really *wanted* a d&c, I ended up waiting for it to happen naturally, and it did. I'm actually glad that I didn't need the d&c. I know it's hard to wait, and to not know when it might happen, but from my experience, I just instinctively knew when it was time. I started spotting on a Thursday, then had some minor cramping that Saturday. That Sunday was ""the day"" and I had everything happen from about 7pm-2am. I amazingly went to work on Monday and felt (more-or-less) fine.  Everyone's experience is different, but for me, while it was horrible emotionally, and at times painful, it actually wasn't as bad as I expected it to be. 

I'm sorry that your doctors failed you. Because mine also gave me absolutely no information, I found it most helpful just to read *everything* I could find on it on the internet. It helped me prepare for what was going to happen, and I feel like it really helped me get through it, knowing what other peoples experiences were like, and if mine was normal or not. 

The things I found helpful during the healing process: Carrying on with life as normally as possible by doing some of the stuff I stopped when I found out I was pregnant. I'm not a big drinker, but I let myself have alcohol again. The day we found out that it was truly over, but before anything had started, we opened a bottle of wine and had a really nice dinner, and just kind of treated ourselves. I had a beer during the Superbowl. I spiked some hot chocolate one night, etc. I just kind of tried to enjoy little treats like that...

And then, I watch a lot of youtube videos. So while I was going through it, I searched out videos/vlogs of other women talking about their experiences, who have gone through a miscarriage. There are TONS of them. I found that actually hearing their stories, as opposed to reading them, helped me process things and see how they've coped and moved on. To me, that was really encouraging. 

Sorry that was a lot of info, but I've been in exactly your situation, just a few months ago. If nothing else, be kind to yourself during this time! This sub is very supportive.

So I'm also a year older, with no living baby on the horizon.  It's hard.  

I've also felt some ""not fair"" feelings at times.  But I try to fight it.  We know people with healthy babies who've taken years to conceive those babies or suffered MC's before having those babies (but only close friends/family know it).  I try to think of that when I hear about people's pregnancies or see other people with babies.

CP's are not just real, they're also very common. You absolutely have a right to be sad.  Your husband is wrong for suggesting otherwise about any of this.   

The other ladies are probably right--he's probably gone through the same feelings you have + feeling helpless when things turned bad and you were 3,000 miles away and there was nothing he could do for you.  And he felt vulnerable, then angry, and took it out on you.

Even though you might be able to sympathize with his experience, it doesn't make his demands okay. You shouldn't have to go through the up's and down's of a loss alone. You shouldn't have to ""apologize"" for doing something that pretty much every woman does (sharing the FRER result). He doesn't get to unilaterally make demands for his needs (would rather not know), while not meeting your needs (listening/validation/support).  

I will also say that, sadly, as pretty much all of us here know, if your husband thinks that there's a point at which it's ""safe"" to learn about a pregnancy, if he thinks there's a point at which a loss of this being you love is guaranteed not to happen...he's mistaken.  The loss of that innocence is one of the tough elements of TTC/pregnancy after loss.  

It's true that partners may grieve and respond to loss in different ways.  But there still needs to be mutual support.  Navigating a loss is challenging, but it is possible for partners to support each other while still creating space for the unique needs of themselves and their partners.   You are entitled to that.

There's something called ""post-traumatic growth"", and it may be that you and your husband experience that from this loss, and it makes your relationship more supportive and resilient. It's early days, but that is my hope for you.  Resources/books for pregnancy loss talk about challenges for couples, and you and your husband might find these resources helpful when navigating this.

During stimulation, you could feel discomfort but I was surprised how fine I felt and I went to work every day no  problem.

I may be desperate for a baby, while others are desperate for love, a house, happiness etc. it doesn‚Äôt make me feel better about not being pregnant/having a baby/losing our baby, but it does help me keep my jealousy in check and it helps me to focus on what I do have.</p>

<p>All of this to say, you‚Äôre not alone in your struggle. I can‚Äôt keep my hopes down, I want this so badly. And each cycle it doesn‚Äôt happen I feel entirely heartbroken for 3-5 days. It helps to remind myself that this deep depression and heartache with lighten as I get closer to my fertile week. My ttc emotions cycle right along with my cycle and I feel like they‚Äôre all pretty normal. Mad, sad, depressed, hopeless, excited, hopeful, scared, all normal. Sending a big hug to you üíï.</p>

Apologies if this is more than you bargained for.

Most of the studies done recently on timing of TTC/conception have aimed to determine if it was *dangerous* to TTC earlier than the standard advice.  

The Love et al (2010) study posted yesterday looked at *conceiving* <6 mos.  Another one Schliep et al. (2016) looked at *starting to TTC* at <=3 mos.  (This is the same group/data that ohw09 linked to.  The Schliep paper looks at time to conceive and rates of conception.  The Wong paper looks at pregnancy outcomes.)    

These studies showed that TTC/conceiving soon after miscarriage is *not* riskier than TTC/conceiving later.  The early groups generally did fine.

What these studies *can't* say is whether starting to TTC/getting pregnant later is riskier.  Why not?   

Well, in both the Love study and the Schliep/Wong study, there were confounding factors.  Women who started TTC/conceived earlier tended to be more educated, wealthier, less likely to be a smoker, and (in Schliep/Wong) less likely to have a diagnosis of subfertility.  The authors can't determine how much these other factors contributed to (slightly) worse outcomes.

Another issue in the Love study is terminations.  The later a woman conceived, the more likely the pregnancy was to end in a termination (2% for the< 6mos. group vs. 10% for the >2yr group).  The authors didn't distinguish between elective terminations and TFMRs.  Given how rare TFMRs are (not 10% of pregnancies!), it seems that there were big differences in elective terminations across groups.  But the authors don't account for this.  If you exclude terminations, then the differences in live birth outcomes are much smaller (~87% for the < 6 mos. group  and ~82% for the rest).  And circling back--some of that remaining gap is likely due to health/habits associated with socioeconomic differences, smoking, etc.

The take-home: You're okay.  Doing your best to cultivate good habits and health is more important than exactly what month you get pregnant.  It's also the only thing we can control.  Take care of yourself and focus on getting well!  :-)",[],,t1_dxp7ukz,False,0,[],False,"<div class=""md""><p>I don&#39;t want this to drive you nuts, so I&#39;m going to dive into the nitty gritty.  Apologies if this is more than you bargained for.</p>

<p>Most of the studies done recently on timing of TTC/conception have aimed to determine if it was <em>dangerous</em> to TTC earlier than the standard advice.  </p>

<p>The Love et al (2010) study posted yesterday looked at <em>conceiving</em> &lt;6 mos.  Another one Schliep et al. (2016) looked at <em>starting to TTC</em> at &lt;=3 mos.  (This is the same group/data that ohw09 linked to.  The Schliep paper looks at time to conceive and rates of conception.  The Wong paper looks at pregnancy outcomes.)    </p>

<p>These studies showed that TTC/conceiving soon after miscarriage is <em>not</em> riskier than TTC/conceiving later.  The early groups generally did fine.</p>

<p>What these studies <em>can&#39;t</em> say is whether starting to TTC/getting pregnant later is riskier.  Why not?   </p>

<p>Well, in both the Love study and the Schliep/Wong study, there were confounding factors.  Women who started TTC/conceived earlier tended to be more educated, wealthier, less likely to be a smoker, and (in Schliep/Wong) less likely to have a diagnosis of subfertility.  The authors can&#39;t determine how much these other factors contributed to (slightly) worse outcomes.</p>

<p>Another issue in the Love study is terminations.  The later a woman conceived, the more likely the pregnancy was to end in a termination (2% for the&lt; 6mos. group vs. 10% for the &gt;2yr group).  The authors didn&#39;t distinguish between elective terminations and TFMRs.  Given how rare TFMRs are (not 10% of pregnancies!), it seems that there were big differences in elective terminations across groups.  But the authors don&#39;t account for this.  If you exclude terminations, then the differences in live birth outcomes are much smaller (~87% for the &lt; 6 mos. group  and ~82% for the rest).  And circling back--some of that remaining gap is likely due to health/habits associated with socioeconomic differences, smoking, etc.</p>

<p>There are also statistical issues with the Love paper that I won&#39;t get into.  (Can you tell that I&#39;m a biologist?)  </p>

<p>The take-home: You&#39;re okay.  Doing your best to cultivate good habits and health is more important than exactly what month you get pregnant.  It&#39;s also the only thing we can control.  Take care of yourself and focus on getting well!  :-)</p>

I started doing OPKs and temping after my loss, because I expected my cycle to be wonky.  (It was.)  But now that it's more back to normal, they're probably a little less useful.  But I like the data points...

I've been using the cheapies, and I found that one brand had really faint ""test"" lines, so I got a different brand.  Done side-by-side, the second brand picks up fainter LH levels and gets darker with positives.  So not all strips are alike.

Probably because it tracks estrogen, it is *supposed* to be used with FMU, so that's a positive too.  

I'm too late in my cycle to start using it this round (depending on cycle length, you have to start using it around day 7-ish to give the reader a baseline).  But if this isn't the month for us, I'm thinking of trying it out.

Someone posted a study yesterday (maybe on TFAB?) that discussed the waiting to conceive time after a loss, and how it's been updated to ""whenever the person is physically and mentally ready"" and that those who conceive within 6 months of a loss have a lower chance of miscarriage in subsequent pregnancies.

SO, my question is, is it months or cycles? By the calendar over 5 months have gone by, but that only equates to 1 or 2 menstrual cycles. So am I almost out of that 6 month marker, or only a third into it??

I'm really sorry you're going through this.  For those of us without children, until we are able to have a child, the possibility that it just won't happen for us is hard to carry.

My sister has adhesions from something similar (her appendix operation was botched, so she required a second, more significant abdominal surgery, thus the adhesions).  No one ever told her or our parents that this could cause fertility issues--that alone was angering.  

The upshot is that it takes her longer than most to get pregnant.  So long that she and my BIL had to do all the standard infertility testing the first time they were TTC. But she got there.  More than once.  I think there's hope for you, too.  But the journey (i.e. the uncertainty, the waiting, the year+ of BFNs before it happens), sucks and is not fair.  

Her doctors suggested surgery to try to remove the adhesions, but that was only to try to improve chances of conception (not because they might be a risk factor for an ectopic pregnancy). (She didn't end up having the surgery.)  If they do pose a risk for another ectopic pregnancy in your case, that might change the IVF equation.  

I'm really sorry that you and your SO aren't on the same page about IVF right now.  This might be the hardest part of your situation.  The results from your HSG are fresh.  I hope with time to process the news, his mindset becomes more flexible.  It doesn't even have to be a commitment to IVF.  It could be something like, ""Let's start putting aside $X each month.  We can decide later if we want to use it for IVF, or something else.""   

This is probably a dumb question, but my understanding was that the luteal phase (post-ovulatory) in most women has pretty low variability.  It's the pre-ovulation phase that tends to vary and produce variable cycle lengths.  If you're regularly getting late periods, and you're measuring ""late"" from your date of ovulation...is that something worth talking to your OB about?  

I kind of realized soon after our loss that the next several years trying to start/grow a family are going to be no fun, with all the risks of challenges getting pregnant/another loss.

More than once.  I think there&#39;s hope for you, too.  But the journey (i.e. the uncertainty, the waiting, the year+ of BFNs before it happens), sucks and is not fair.  </p>

<p>Her doctors suggested surgery to try to remove the adhesions, but that was only to try to improve chances of conception (not because they might be a risk factor for an ectopic pregnancy). (She didn&#39;t end up having the surgery.)  If they do pose a risk for another ectopic pregnancy in your case, that might change the IVF equation.  </p>

<p>I&#39;m really sorry that you and your SO aren&#39;t on the same page about IVF right now.  This might be the hardest part of your situation.  The results from your HSG are fresh.  I hope with time to process the news, his mindset becomes more flexible.  It doesn&#39;t even have to be a commitment to IVF.  It could be something like, &quot;Let&#39;s start putting aside $X each month.  We can decide later if we want to use it for IVF, or something else.&quot;   </p>

<p>This is probably a dumb question, but my understanding was that the luteal phase (post-ovulatory) in most women has pretty low variability.  It&#39;s the pre-ovulation phase that tends to vary and produce variable cycle lengths.  If you&#39;re regularly getting late periods, and you&#39;re measuring &quot;late&quot; from your date of ovulation...is that something worth talking to your OB about?  </p>

<p>I kind of realized soon after our loss that the next several years trying to start/grow a family are going to be no fun, with all the risks of challenges getting pregnant/another loss.  It sucks, but it is what it is.  Just gotta keep putting one foot in front of the other.</p>

We did IVF once, and it worked. Then we went back and did IVF for a sibling. She passed away due to a rare neurological issue sixteen days after birth.

I realize not everyone has the physical, mental, emotional, or financial resources to do IVF. But having been through it twice, I will tell you, it's not the worst thing in the world.

Don't lose heart. If IVF is your worst case scenario, and it was mine for those 2.5 years of infertility, there is a lot of good stuff possible, even with the worst case.

So I share, there&#39;s tears, but I get through it, and people were great. But then it goes to another co-worker, who I would consider a friend and is calling in for the meeting, and she reveals that although she hadn&#39;t planned to share this, she was going through a miscarriage right now and it was her second this year.  I feel horrible for her; we&#39;ve talked about the challenges of having kids/deciding to have kids in our field, and to know she&#39;s going through the same thing and has done it twice just sucks. I&#39;m trying to figure out how best to support her.  Just one of those moments where you empathize, and it draws you out of your own headspace.</p>

40w exactly yesterday. I started having contractions yesterday at 11:30am, pretty irreggular, and I gave up trying to stomach the pain anymore at 3pm. Went to get checked, was 4 cm, and since they were going to induce me in a few hours anyway, they just admitted me. Got my epidural placed right away, started pitocin an hour later (5pm).

**[TW: bit scary]** Around 8pm, things got really scary. My water broke when I was 6 cm, and I went from 6-9 cm in about 10 minutes.

My saint of a husband kept it together; he thinks he didn't do anything but push my epidural button every 15 minutes, but he did the hardest job in that room.

After they stabilized us, they said that can happen when you progress so quickly, and it was time to push. 10 minutes later, they managed to turn her (if you've seen the first few episodes of Call the Midwife, they turn a sunny-side up baby, and that's what we did!), and all look a sudden there's a purple blob on my chest for 5 seconds before they whisked her off to make sure her vitals were good (because of our scare when she dropped).

I got my one request, which was to have Dad do skin-to-skin first (while I was getting cleaned up), and that makes me very happy.

No name yet, but weighing in at 8 lb 5 oz, 20.75 inches long. Hoping to update with some more info when Dad and I get some more rest-- it took 4h to get her to stop nursing and take a little nap!

I don't know your exact history, but I have read in the supplements research that if you're not doing IVF, you may want to be cautious about the melatonin.  The tl;dr version: taking melatonin supplements might mess with your ovulation.  

The details: IVF patients can get the benefits, without the drawbacks, because their bodies get flooded with other hormones that force them to ovulate.  But for women trying to get pregnant ""the old fashioned way"", taking a melatonin supplement might come with trade-offs.  (Unfortunately, all the science knows is that melatonin changes the production of reproductive hormone receptors--up or down, depending on receptor--and changes the responses to those hormones, in follicle cells that help coordinate the post-ovulation hormonal response.  How that affects TTC is untested.)  

One suggestion has been to do things to boost melatonin according to the body's natural rhythms: Get more light exposure during the day, and avoid bright lights/screens before bed.  The thinking is that this will up melatonin levels without disrupting any hormonal cycles.  But this hypothesis is exactly that: there's no research to support or refute this.

My son had something that can't be diagnosed with normal ultrasounds, and was only diagnosed when it was because of an accident.

If the baby wasn't healthy, I hope you get answers as to why.  The uncertainty of that can be hard.  I imagine it's also hard not knowing the baby's sex--not being able to give him or her a name.  (Or maybe you've found a name that works with both genders?)  

I know you didn't have to make a choice to end your pregnancy, so that aspect of TFMR support will not resonate with you.  But you might relate to other issues faced by TFMR parents---the feelings that come with learning your baby had a congenital disorder, the grieving of two babies--the healthy baby you were expecting, and the actual baby you had, the worry about the issue recurring in subsequent pregnancies....  I found the book *The Prenatal Bombshell* by Sherokee Ilse and Stephanie Azri particularly helpful in discussing these things.  I especially liked it because it didn't feel judgmental--it also talked about options like perinatal hospice, or the decision to raise a child with severe handicaps, and the hardships of those paths as well.  

You might also find the resources for later-term loss on this [recent thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/ttcafterloss/comments/8cibjh/infant_loss_support/) helpful.

I've also found joining a parent support group helpful.  Our facilitators are parents who've also had losses, and from them, I can say, it will get better.  At least two of our facilitators had a late loss in addition to earlier miscarriages...and when they talk about, it's clear they haven't forgotten their babies...but at the same time, they seem ""normal"" (for lack of a better word).  They're lives have been changed, but they've healed.  It's not a fast process...these are women whose losses were years ago...but it happened for them and it will happen for us, too.

My husband and I believe that life starts at conception, as does my OB, so we see it as the loss of a child, though they are very young and small. My OB and the Mayo Clinic have both included my earliest losses in the total count as well.

From a medical perspective, losses before 5 weeks are more common than later losses. It takes more early losses to tip the balance away from ""bad luck"" towards ""what is the underlying issue?""

I think one challenging issue with very early losses is that we don't have as much information on them. It's only in the last 25 years that at-home urine pregnancy tests have been available. Even today, many women are probably unaware of these early losses - there may only be a few days of positive tests, so it's easy to miss. I suspect I've had two more early losses, but couldn't work up the bravery to test and confirm. I imagine a lot of couples that suffer from what we call infertility are actually suffering from early losses. So many aspects of baby loss are poorly understood :(

There seem to be a few types of common, though not necessarily evidence based, intervention. First, there are hormones. Progesterone and estrogen are sometimes prescribed post-ovulation in case the luteal phase is too short or the lining to thin. Clomid or femara are sometimes prescribed to get a ""stronger"" ovulation. Second type of intervention focuses on improving gamete quality. This typically involves supplements and/or medications for man and woman, as well as lifestyle changes (things like telling men to wear boxers, avoid hot tubs, etc). Third set of interventions focus on inflammation, autoimmune issues, chronic infections, etc. These tend to involve lifestyle change, perhaps baby aspirin, and/or more supplements.

I think the research is still out on a lot of these suggestions. There's unfortunately a lot of room for quackery when people are desperate for answers, so that's something to watch for :( My husband and I are in a different position since we've had a several later losses, but there are still a lot of unknowns with later losses. We've been open to trying things that have mixed or unknown efficacy, provided that they've got good safety records.

My bloodwork all looked totally normal to my PCP; everything was healthy and within normal ranges.

I fell pregnant that cycle and that one stuck, so I was never able to get the HSG from him, but he did put me on progesterone suppositories as soon as I got a positive HPT; just as a precaution. I obviously don‚Äôt know what can cause recurrent CPs for everyone else, but I did learn that a really minor imbalance with a really minor fix could be all that is needed and it‚Äôs worth investigating, so I would be ready to advocate for yourself and push for answers.

For what it‚Äôs worth, when my LC was 6 mos we moved cross country. Before TTC again, we met with a new RE to see if I would need any further monitoring based on what we had learned previously.

I saw a therapist for the first time the other day and mentioned this worry to her. I explained that I *know* that my pregnancy loss (which was due to trisomy 18, a random chromosomal abnormality that has a less than 1 in 6000 chance of happening in someone my age) has nothing to do with my fertility, but I have convinced myself that I will not be able to get pregnant again for a very long time, if ever.

I think this actually might be what's going on...anyway, it helped me to name it as a fear rather than a reality. It's a more accurate name for the emotion, and it doesn't wrongly try to predict the future.

I agree with other posters that you have every reason to be optimistic about getting pregnant again if you've already gotten pregnant once before. Obviously, you can't know when it will happen again for you, and it's extremely anxiety-provoking to think about how difficult a prolonged ttc period will be. TTC for a long time is hard on anyone, but it's going to be even harder for all of us now that we've already been rudely awakened from the happy, optimistic haze of being part of the fortunate majority. This makes it a lot easier for us to expect and believe in the worst. Shit has already happened, so why shouldn't we expect it to keep happening?

It often means that you're talking with someone who is so uncomfortable with grief that they'd rather dismiss it than acknowledge that the loss of a child doesn't have a ""bright side.""

From a medical perspective, conceiving a baby only to have them die is different from never conceiving. There are many medical issues that cause recurrent loss, but not infertility, and visa versa. There's actually a surprising amount of difference given how often they are lumped together. However, I still think that it ""You got pregnant once, and that's the most important thing"" is an incredibly stupid thing to say and very poor bedside manner. I've been pregnant 7 times only for our babies to die - how wonderful that the ""most important thing"" has happened so often for us. I think it would be just as insensitive and rude to tell a couple that was unable to conceive that ""at least you don't have dead children"" - I mean, I'm sure they don't want that either, but it's hardly a fair measure of how things are going.

I&#39;ve not had a D&amp;C so I don&#39;t know how it compares.</p>

<p>I did to rounds of misoprostal as the first round left retained tissue. The first round was vaginal insertion, and the cramping was intense, so make sure you have pain relief available (I had codeine prescribed) and that you&#39;re near a bathroom for the next 24-48 hours. A hot water bottle is a lifesaver too. </p>

<p>The second round was because I had retained tissue, and it was either that or a D&amp;C. The second round I took orally over the course of two days and absolutely nothing happened with it. The remaining tissue was so small they decided not to do a D&amp;C and it&#39;s now passing with my period. Hopefully one round of the pills will be enough for you, it is with most cases.</p>

<p>The upside of the pills is you get to be at home and make yourself as comfortable as possible. I hope it goes well for you.</p>

Here are some things I've been doing lately to cope and hopefully conquer this disease.  We are currently benched while we wait for our follow up with our RPL doctor.  I'm anticipating needing a surgery to remove whatever they found during my hysteroscopy. 

A lot of what I'm doing is trying to improve my egg health, in the hopes that will help us when we start trying again. All my bloodwork is normal. We don't have karyotype results (and won't for probably 2 more months). 

1) Focus on my mental health first and foremost.  This means managing stress and doing a ton of self care.  Walking, connecting with friends, limiting alcohol, being kind to my husband, etc etc etc. 

2) Acupuncture.  I'm pretty sure my TCM doc is doing treatments almost entirely for mental health and stress management right now. I love acupuncture and feel like it's really supportive of my efforts to be mentally and physically healthy right now. 

3) Exercise: I'm trying to exercise at least 6 days a week.  I'm staying flexible as to what that means.  At least an hour of walking counts.  Yoga counts (yin doesn't count).  Running, weights, hiking, etc.  All are good. I try to assess how I feel every day and listen to my body.  A tired day gets yoga and walking.  I think that's ok. 

4) Diet:  I'm trying to lose some weight.  I have gained a lot of weight in the last couple of years.  I'm about 13 lbs down from my highest and would like to lose at least 20 more (or even 35-40 but I'm trying to keep my goals attainable).  So I'm counting calories.  But I'm also trying to keep my diet super healthy, where I can.  Focusing on fruits, veggies, protein, legumes, and good fats.  Avoiding processed carbs and sugar wherever possible/realistic. Limiting alcohol (my wiiiiiine). I've only had bread, pasta, and dessert while out with friends lately, and I'm fine with that. 

5) Supplements:  I'm currently taking ubiquinol, myo-inositol, vitamin d, prenatals, DHA, baby aspirin, 3mg melatonin at night, and evening primrose oil (which I take for a skin condition).  I'm also drinking a pot of combined red clover blossom and red raspberry leaf tea every day. I will switch this around when we're actually trying again (EPO only til ovulation, etc). 

6)  Sleep:  I've been trying to REALLY favour sleep by going to be really early and relaxing at night time.  I think it's helping my mental state, and every alternative medicine doctor and resource I have seen has recommended really trying to get lots of good quality sleep.  

7) Therapy:  I'm having mixed success with this.  My regular counsellor I don't think has the experience and expertise to really help with this process, but I do love her.  I saw a counsellor specialising in reproduction and women's issue yesterday, but she was young and honestly not that helpful.  I may save my money for acupuncture.

It turns out that some of the information I was given in my initial queries about this practice was incorrect/incomplete. My top 3 questions were:
1) do I have a specific primary doctor/care team for is it just whoever is available?
2) Does a tech perform my scans and pass stills to a doctor, or does the doctor perform the scans and talk me through them? 
3) What options are available in case of missed miscarriage? Can a D&C be performed in office or must it be done via the hospital?

I was told that I would have a primary doctor who would cover my appointments unless there were scheduling conflicts (ex. He's on vacation, or booked out in the only times I can come in). This was apparently incomplete info - I was told yesterday that I must have appointments with all of the doctors in the practice at some point along the way, as they can't guarantee who will be available to perform any procedure/delivery/on call appointment/etc. So the first appointment I'll have isn't even with the doctor I was referred to, even though he's listed as my ""primary doctor"". There are 8 doctors I will need to have appointments with, so I'll probably hardly get to know ""my"" doctor anyway.

I was told the doctor would be in the room while scans are performed by a tech, or would perform the scan themselves. Also apparently not correct information - it depends on the doc and some just want the stills. I hate having a tech do my scans without a doctor there because they can't answer my questions when I see something I'm worried about. A doctor will let me know immediately if they're worried about something in the scan. The tech will just sit there with a poker face and refuse to answer questions and it infuriates the living shit out of me.

And they do all their D&C's in the hospital which makes sense since they're so close (literally next door to the hospital).

So anyway, I'm not happy about my appointment tomorrow but I'll try to go into it with an open mind.

<p>In the beginning I craved finding people with my exact story, (healthy baby, unexpected) but as time went on I started to feel like the details didn‚Äôt matter as much (although when it comes to developing irl friendships I still tend towards late loss and infant loss moms). </p>

<p>There are some Facebook groups out there, The Compassionate Friends has an infant and toddler loss group that offers specific support. As time passes you may find that your grief becomes more generalized, and if you try to ttc again this could be a good space to return to. </p>

>he wants me to stop taking my prenatal vitamin until I get my next period. Anyone have any experience with that?... I'm concerned because I was advised to take my prenatals for a few months before starting TTC to let them build up in my system.

I would also ask your doctor about both of these worries. 

The reason prenatals are recommended to all women who might become pregnant is because having too little folate increases the risks of neural tube issues in a growing baby. In general, folate is important to all cells, especially those that are growing fast and replicating quickly. This means that it's also important while healing from injuries and blood loss. 

My doctor has never recommended stopping prenatals after miscarrying. But I'm also not sure how much a difference a month without prenatals would make. Assuming you're eating a reasonable diet, you should be getting most of your nutrition needs met already. It would be really worrying if a month without vitamins was enough to lead deficiencies.

Sometimes doctors will recommend trying to reduce the amount of folate you eat/supplement after an ectopic pregnancy, even if it resolves without intervention. The idea here is that you'll discourage fast-growing cells from replicating, including the baby or any cells the baby left behind. Perhaps your doctor is worried that the baby wasn't in the uterus?

Anyway, all of this is speculation... The easiest way to get your doctor's reasoning is to call. If something seems off or you don't trust your doctor's advice, maybe it's worth getting a second opinion?

Big Bang Theory was fairly accurate with their most recent pregnancy storyline, but the show often forgets that they have infants and those characters are away from their kids way more often than they actually would be.</p>

Obviously all procedures are going to vary a bit, but I found my csection with my LC to overall be quite pleasant. (Having done both ways, I promise there‚Äôs really no good way to get a baby out of you but there are benefits to each option.) I was taken to an OR for prepping with the anesthesiologist and either one or two nurses‚Äî the anesthesiologist numbed me, they tested me various times to make sure I was completely numb from basically my braline to my toes. They sanitized my belly and did all the other prep that goes into preparing someone for surgery. It was nerve wracking because my csection was not planned and I was dissatisfied and anxious about it, but I was open about that and the team I had was extremely reassuring. Once the drapes had been erected they brought in the surgical team and my husband, who was able to sit by my side and hold my hand the entire time. He was great about keeping me calm, and the anesthesiologist was sitting by my head and she was also helpful. I happened to deliver at a teaching hospital so my surgical team was large because they had residents and an attending taking part. I did my best to absolutely ignore what was going on and focus on my husband who was working very hard to distract me. But he kept an ear out for the surgical team‚Äî not for specifics, just to judge their tone. They remained calm and professional the entire time and that kept him calm so he could focus on me. I didn‚Äôt feel any pain, but I could feel pressure and pulling, which was a sensation I‚Äôm not exactly looking forward to again, but it was tolerable. Once my daughter was delivered, she was immediately weighed, measured, and deemed healthy by way of good APGARs by the pediatric team (in the room!) so they wrapped her up and gave her to my husband  who then brought her to me. He held her while I kind of awkwardly rested her head on my shoulder as they stitched me up. (Lots more weird pulling sensations here.) Husband carried her while I was wheeled to recovery where we were permitted to try breastfeeding.

At the time this was considered a very family/baby friendly c-section‚Äî the baby was never out of my sight, was given skin-to-skin contact as soon as possible (it wasn‚Äôt permitted in the OR), and I was able to actually make contact with the baby while still in surgery. The anesthesiologist even snapped a few photos on my phone for us. (Nothing graphic, just baby.) In the past 3.5 years alone in the US big pushes have been made to make csections even more baby friendly, so this time around I am expecting to have immediate skin-to-skin contact with the baby in the OR (provided all is well) an extra support person by my head to offer some comfort to both me and my husband, presumably take photos, etc. I‚Äôm not sure what is the standard of care where you are‚Äî in the states it still varies much by region and hospital but the overall trend is to make the immediate period after birth try to feel as much like a vaginal delivery as possible for Mom and baby (uterine sutures notwithstanding.)

Recovery is a whole different ball game for a c-section, but I had no long term complications and while I would prefer to be induced, I‚Äôm totally okay with the csection since induction won‚Äôt be an option for me. My number one recommendation is to take the pain meds regularly and with as strong a dose as you feel you need that they will prescribe. Keeping on top of the pain is much easier than chasing after it, and you will heal better if you aren‚Äôt in as much pain. You will be able to judge when it‚Äôs time to start tapering off to lower doses and less potent medications. Also, take stool softeners. Lastly, have a small step stool waiting at home to help you get into bed. 

I hope this helped rather than made you more freaked out! I always find that knowing what to expect in an unknown situation is comforting.

Last but not least, if all else fails, remember that the baby is in you and has to come out, so even if you‚Äôre totally freaked out, this train has left with you and your baby on it! ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è",[],,t1_dxgbm5h,False,0,[],False,"<div class=""md""><p>If I remember correctly you are having a c-section? </p>

So I'm on CD3 of what I think is my first period after my MC, and all I have to say is holy FUCKING shit. I'm bleeding so much! I'm glad in a way because my body obviously needs to get everything out.

Had a feel around and I can feel more sort of dangling from out of my cervix. It's fucking horrible. 

CD1&2 we're pretty heavy (for my usual period) and so I hoped I might start tapering off today. My normal bleed is usually about five days, with 1&2 being the heaviest. At my last ultrasound they said there was still some tissue remaining which would come out with my next period, but this feels like a lot. I've got a bit of cramping, but not too much.

<p>Then try to get some sleep, even for a little bit. It will help settle your mind and make it easier for you to communicate when you‚Äôve had some rest. </p>

<p>There are a lot of good suggestions about approaching resolution with your husband‚Äî counseling is a great option to work through these things, and I recommend it for you whether he is willing to go or not.</p>

<p>I hope when the dust settles a bit on this you and your husband can find some clarity and common goals. Please take care of yourself. </p>

I&#39;m not a member of the 3rd trimester group (which, despite the name, includes women who lost babies shortly after birth), but perhaps it would be a good fit for you. <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/groups/1539813826289183/"">Here&#39;s the group</a>.</p>

A second-trimester loss due to IC is devastating enough... but a second loss past 12 weeks on top of that? So so hard. Sending you lots of gentle hugs. 

I lost a son, Ethan, in 2014 due to IC. I did receive that as a diagnosis from my OB and MFM - basically, cervical insufficiency is one of those diagnoses you receive in the absence of anything  else clearly going wrong, or when other causes of preterm labor are ruled out.  Now..there was a European study done that indicated cerclage should only be tried after (get this - brace yourself) three second-trimester losses, because many times IC does not recur. My MFM scoffed at this, of course, and said that one loss was enough; obviously from an ethical standpoint that recommendation is problematic (and the study acknowledges this) and with a case of IC you just do the cerclage after one loss. 

This is all to say that some docs MAY NOT NECESSARILY recommend a cerclage to you right away for this pregnancy and may give you the option of biweekly monitoring. Certainly, if the idea of a surgery seems awful to you, this is an option. That said, I now have a one-year-old daughter, and I received a McDonald cerclage at 13 weeks, was on Makena (P17, a form of progesterone proven to prevent preterm labor) injections from 16-36 weeks, and had biweekly ultrasounds to check my cervix until 24 weeks, plus a third trimester growth scan. That is the standard of care and what you should push for. Cerclage is about 90% effective at preventing another loss...and then add the progesterone on top of that, PLUS the monitoring..? This is a very serious problem that is more fixable than most things in modern medicine.

On top of all that, I‚Äôm at the end of my first cycle of TTC after my MC and my BBT dropped this morning after two days of BFN‚Äôs so I‚Äôm dealing with the disappointment from that. Given all those circumstances, I can‚Äôt bring myself to go over and have lunch with them but I know it‚Äôs going to be awkward because I‚Äôm not there for my own husband‚Äôs birthday celebration. I feel bad about not being able to go. It just really sucks knowing that I should be able to go have a good time and talk about all things pregnancy and baby with my husband‚Äôs family but I can‚Äôt because instead of still being happily pregnant, my son‚Äôs gone. Luckily, my husband understands and his family has been supportive so I think they will, too. </p>

I'm not sure who to talk to, and I don't know what's going on with my body. 

&nbsp;

Background: I've had 2 miscarriages in the past: a MMC at 11wks in 2006, and a traumatic miscarriage at 12wks, 2 years ago. And still childless. I am 37yo, and found out recently that due to genetics it's probably likely that I'll go through early menopause (nothing diagnosed, but my sister recently started menopause at 42yo, and we found out Mum started at 45) so this has added to my paranoia.

&nbsp;

This cycle I started spotting 6 days before my period was due. I've *never* had an early period (and I've been recording my menstrual cycles since 2006) and so I got excited thinking it was implantation bleeding. But, then it turned into more than spotting and lasted 2.5 days. (TMI but it wasn't enough to appear on a pad, but enough to have blood in the water). Then, nothing. Absolutely nothing. Now I'm nearly 4 days ""late"" for the time my period should have started. All tests come up negative. I have no symptoms of pregnancy, and also not even any symptoms of PMS. (And I always have sore boobs and pre-menstrual cramps). I feel physically ""normal"" the way I would after my period has finished. I don't know what the heck is going on, and I'm confused and worried. 
I thought maybe it was a chemical pregnancy, but honestly, there was hardly any blood, and there was no cramping. THEN, I got worried that it was a sign of early menopause (because fear of never having a baby is causing me to spiral into this paranoid state). I have spent a long time googling and looking through this sub, and I just don't know what's happening. My boyfriend is being really supportive, but is also confused. Every day I wait for my period, but I don't know. 

&nbsp;

I guess I'm hoping that someone has been through this before? Could I have skipped a period from stress? (but I've had worse stress in my life in the past and never skipped a period.) I don't know, I guess I just wasn't sure who else to talk to, and I don't want to talk to friends about this because they'll either get excited, or say the wrong thing, and I kind of don't wanna hear those things.

I&#39;m on partial bedrest and can&#39;t work right now, so I spent a lot of time this week researching baby gear, like strollers and such. Part of me feels like this is a mistake, because I haven&#39;t even gotten past the point of loss from last time (17+6, I&#39;m 16+3 today), but I also keep telling myself that having hope will make me feel better now and if we have another loss, it will hurt regardless.

Later tonight my DH and I were invited to a double birthday thing for my Dh‚Äôs friends. But the two birthday people are why it‚Äôs a little awkward for me.

Birthday person #1 is the girl who told me after our first loss ‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry! If it makes you feel any better I can‚Äôt even get pregnant!‚Äù As a matter of fact, it doesn‚Äôt make me feel better. Such an odd sentiment. Now I would never wish the heartbreak of infertility on anyone, but she never had any testing done. She was just one of those girls that never got pregnant even though she wasn‚Äôt ever trying to get pregnant. Then she literally gets pregnant about a month after this with the man she is seeing, while she is still married to a different dude (though they were separated). I didn‚Äôt know about her pregnancy yet though.

Birthday person #2 is the brother of the above girl and while we were out with a group, including his sister (above), he announced her recent pregnancy the SAME DAY I had just told him I lost my second pregnancy. She looked so awkward; it was painfully obvious she wasn‚Äôt ready to announce yet, or she just didn‚Äôt want to in front of me. She just slinked down into her seat, looked at me and said sorry. I was so pissed at her brother for a long time! One, show some sensitivity! I literally just told you I miscarried my second pregnancy. I‚Äôm sitting here trying to control my bleeding from it while you‚Äôre announcing someone else‚Äôs pregnancy. Two, who announces someone‚Äôs pregnancy without their express permission?!

Anywho, I just cut them out of my life after this. They aren‚Äôt my friends, and while my DH understood my anger, it didn‚Äôt upset him like it did me, so he continued to hang out with them, which is fine.

Which brings us to my current pregnancy (a third loss and a bunch of testing later). They had finally asked if I was upset with them. I don‚Äôt know what DH told them, but the sister decided to apologize in person for her insensitive ‚Äúif it makes you feel better‚Äù comment. But brother only pseudo-apologized. It was like a politician apology, like ‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry, but this is why what happened happened.‚Äù And he only said it to my husband and not to me in person. He thinks it is enough because the last time we saw him he acted like everything was hunky-dory. I‚Äôm not angry with him anymore, but I don‚Äôt respect him because he couldn‚Äôt just apologize and say ‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry I was such a jerk.‚Äù So now I always feel awkward around him. I‚Äôm 19+5 today and feel awkward about this birthday party. Not sure if backing out now is an option since I already said yes and don‚Äôt want to reopen any potential drama.

On a funny note, I told my sister this and she told me ‚ÄúYou should announce your birthday at his party and then blow out the candles!‚Äù My birthday is in January! üòÇ It made me laugh!",[],,t1_dxcmtbl,False,0,[],False,"<div class=""md""><p>You guys, I‚Äôm having a weird situation today.</p>

I do feel awful for him having to put up with my lapses. Grief hits me so hard sometimes and I might cry for hours or get extremely upset. So although I haven't had to help him cope, he's the one who consistently has to help me.

I HAD A LIVE BABY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! April 10th, 4l bs 13 oz. Eleanor Jane.

Born 5.5 weeks early, much to my shock since my last live baby was **9 days overdue**. Water was leaking, ended up transferring hospitals in an ambulance bc my hospital doesn't deliver till 35 weeks (I was 34+4), then found out she was BREECH after weeks of being head down. So c-section it was! A wild adventure of a day. When I heard her crying in the OR, I couldn't stop saying ""Omg she's alive she's alive"" over and over. 

And when I got to hold her? Forget about it. SOBBING. I had just let myself think maybe I'd get a baby and then she was in my arms.

She's gonna be in the special care nursery for a few days to learn how to eat, but she's doing great already! Surgery wasn't as bad as I feared (I was a crunchy water birth mama at some point in my life...lol times have changed) and she's doing a good job for a preemie with nursing. 

We are on cloud nine. So relieved and happy. Two years ago this month we lost Clare, one year ago this month was Peter's due date, and now little Eleanor made her birthday in April. It's so special. Oops, I'm crying again.

Thanks for all your love and support during this and Peter's pregnancies. <3

I'd been dithering between 4 options - a cold but practical OB I've met before, a kind but rather sugar-coaty OB I have met before, a younger OB I've never met before who specializes in high risk & MFM treatment, and another OB with several decades of experience I've never met before who is extremely highly rated and my RE highly recommended as a good fit for me.

I chose the last. There were a couple of deciding factors - firstly, the hospital he's affiliated with is the one I would choose to have a D&C at or deliver at. I'm familiar with it and even though it's further from our home it has a calming, welcoming feel that sets me at ease whenever I go there. His reviews and years of experience were also outstanding and my RE's frank description of him as a ""no bullshit"" doctor (his words, not mine!) really fit with what my husband and I were looking for. When my RE said ""if he doesn't know the answer, he won't waffle on - he'll tell you he doesn't know.

There aren't a lot of fertility/pregnancy related medical professionals in this area that my RE doesn't know - whether through his own work or his wife's (she was an L&D nurse before she retired), and he's given me his honest opinion on our short-list. For example, he suggested that sugar-coaty OB wouldn't be a good fit for me because I get anxious if I have to read between the lines and always jump to the worst conclusion first.

So we've had all of our paperwork sent over to the new OB's office, and are just waiting to see when our first appointment with him will be. It should apparently get scheduled in the next couple of days once the office receives and reviews my file.

And finally, a small victory yesterday- I made it an entire 24 hours without vomiting!!! Not sure if it's the sea bands I've taken to wearing, adjustments to my meds (now taking 12.5mg of phenergan every 2 hours instead of 2x diclegis morning & evening), or just hormones settling down a little.

<p>I&#39;d been dithering between 4 options - a cold but practical OB I&#39;ve met before, a kind but rather sugar-coaty OB I have met before, a younger OB I&#39;ve never met before who specializes in high risk &amp; MFM treatment, and another OB with several decades of experience I&#39;ve never met before who is extremely highly rated and my RE highly recommended as a good fit for me.</p>

<p>I chose the last. There were a couple of deciding factors - firstly, the hospital he&#39;s affiliated with is the one I would choose to have a D&amp;C at or deliver at. I&#39;m familiar with it and even though it&#39;s further from our home it has a calming, welcoming feel that sets me at ease whenever I go there. His reviews and years of experience were also outstanding and my RE&#39;s frank description of him as a &quot;no bullshit&quot; doctor (his words, not mine!) really fit with what my husband and I were looking for.

TLDR; parents are adopting a baby and I'm not handling it well. 

I'm four weeks out from my miscarriage, and today was my final blood draw to make sure my hcg levels are below 9. I thought I was emotionally okay and finally in a stable place, or at least done crying at baby thoughts. However, I just got a text from my dad saying that the birth mother of my soon to be here sister just went into labor. I don't know why my parents are adopting a baby. This will be dad's fifth child and step-mom's second. Dad is nearly 50, an step-mom is not far behind. They have custody of my 16 year old sister and have my 7 year old brother. I just don't see why they've decided to adopt, except to give my step-mom the full chance at having a daughter and my dad a chance to be fully involved with his children (he's retired now, but parents went through messy divorce-sister's custody is a new thing for them). 

I should be excited about the baby and having a new sibling and happy for them or whatever, but I'm not. I'm angry and upset and hurt and jealous, and I don't even want to respond to their text message informing me of labor and I definitely don't want information on the baby. We didn't tell our families I was pregnant because of my side's inability to be empathetic in case of a loss, and my husband's side being over bearing as it is.

You're not an idiot for talking to your doctor about this at all! It took me several tried to get someone to take my concerns seriously, but eventually someone did. I think when I was saying really light period, they just were not hearing me that it wasn't even light flow, but spotting the entire time and not that heavily either. 

I started with a saline sonogram, which failed because they couldn't get the catheter in, then an hsg which showed that nearly my entire uterus was blocked, then I finally did a hysteroscopy to treat it (and then two more because my uterus was really damaged). If you can go straight to the hysteroscopy, that's great! But most ob/gyns will start with either a saline sonogram or an hsg (although the hysteroscopy is technically better, it's not common to have either of these other tests say your uterus is fine when it actually isn't, so they're a reasonable starting place).

You&#39;re not an idiot for talking to your doctor about this at all! It took me several tried to get someone to take my concerns seriously, but eventually someone did. I think when I was saying really light period, they just were not hearing me that it wasn&#39;t even light flow, but spotting the entire time and not that heavily either. </p>

<p>I started with a saline sonogram, which failed because they couldn&#39;t get the catheter in, then an hsg which showed that nearly my entire uterus was blocked, then I finally did a hysteroscopy to treat it (and then two more because my uterus was really damaged). If you can go straight to the hysteroscopy, that&#39;s great! But most ob/gyns will start with either a saline sonogram or an hsg (although the hysteroscopy is technically better, it&#39;s not common to have either of these other tests say your uterus is fine when it actually isn&#39;t, so they&#39;re a reasonable starting place). </p>

Well we had a repeat ultrasound yesterday and things have massively improved.  Two weeks ago there was a yolk sac and no baby.  It didn't look great but my doctor said it wasn't something we can worry about this early so we went home and tried to relax until we could go back.

Yesterday we saw a baby AND a heartbeat! We've never reached this point in pregnancy before so that was something.  However, despite this great growth I can't get myself to focus on the positives.  Based on LMP I should be 8+4, but I know I ovulated about a week late so I was expecting it to measure small...but it was measuring at 6+4.  Two weeks behind sounds crazy to me.

<p>Well we had a repeat ultrasound yesterday and things have massively improved.  Two weeks ago there was a yolk sac and no baby.  It didn&#39;t look great but my doctor said it wasn&#39;t something we can worry about this early so we went home and tried to relax until we could go back.</p>

<p>Yesterday we saw a baby AND a heartbeat! We&#39;ve never reached this point in pregnancy before so that was something.  However, despite this great growth I can&#39;t get myself to focus on the positives.  Based on LMP I should be 8+4, but I know I ovulated about a week late so I was expecting it to measure small...but it was measuring at 6+4.  Two weeks behind sounds crazy to me.

I know you were trying to hard to juggle everything this month and make it work.  

I'm having a bad day, too.  This past cycle was my first ""back to normal"" cycle, and I was having higher temps during my TWW than I've ever had--so I was also feeling particularly hopeful I'd get a positive, but no.  

So we're also looking at more TTC.  We've now tried as many cycles as it took to get pregnant last time, so that's a gloomy milestone to pass.  (And I'm also over 35, so the window for TTC ""naturally"" is getting shorter.)  And this month also marks a year to when we really started TTC, another sad milestone.

I saw something last night by accident about deliveries, and it really set me off.  Maybe because my full-term delivery would have been three weeks ago.  It made me so sad remembering how different our birth experience was.  All my fears for the future came roaring back.  I cried so much last night, and had a hard time falling asleep. And sleep deprivation just makes it that much worse.  

Strategies for coping...I used to be the kind of person to push myself through anything stressful--to just keep going.  With my loss/bad days, though, my tendency has been to slow down and ease up.  Take anything that doesn't *have* to be done that day off my plate.  Just try to get the essentials done.  

I use the time that frees up to do things that make me feel better/distract my mind from the cycle of sad thoughts.  [Or sometimes, I delve into the sad thoughts and do some ""grief work""...because if I don't, it builds up and comes out anyway.]

Honestly, the ""easing up"" strategy comes with trade-offs.  (Mostly in the form of stress about things that didn't get done, and a lack of feelings of accomplishment.) Some days, I wish I pushed myself more.  

I've also been keeping a ""standing"" monthly appointment with my counselor.  My next appt. is later this week.   The last couple weeks, I've been feeling so much better that I considered cancelling it.  But after this latest ""bad day"", I'm glad to have something scheduled.  I've learned that even when I feel okay and I don't think I have anything to talk about, once I go and we start talking, there's been more on my mind than I realized, and it's always been useful.

I'm 6 weeks exactly today. I went in for an ultrasound with my RE. Before the  tech began, I asked her if it's true that there's a chance there won't be a heartbeat yet, and if that's normal. She reassured me that, yes, sometimes it's normal not to see a heartbeat yet. 

We saw a yolk sac and fetal pole, she said congratulations a few times and that everything looked good. No baby or heartbeat visible yet. I began to freak out, despite my conversation with her earlier. We then met my RE after. She told my husband & I congratulations several times, then she said she would like to book a follow-up ultrasound in two weeks (8 weeks) to confirm baby and heartbeat. 

I told her I have an 8 week appointment scheduled with a high risk OB. She then told me that ""we like to confirm viability here before sending you out so that it rules out a miscarriage."" 

Um...what? Why would you say this to a person who has suffered a stillbirth before?! Why even talk about miscarriage if she just told me that everything looked okay? I understand that doctors have to let us know every possible scenario, but she just finished telling me that everything looked fine, yet when I told her I have an ultrasound scheduled with someone else she throws that at me.

I got very panicked afterwards. So, now I'm booked at the RE for an ultrasound next week, at 7 weeks, although I have one with the high risk OB at 8. I am starting to think that she just wants to make money off of me and that it's weird. 

I am very annoyed that I even agreed to an early ultrasound because of how nervous I am now that I didn't yet see a heartbeat. :(

I've never had one so early before. My son's ultrasound was about 9 weeks. So I don't know what's normal, and what's abnormal.

<p>I&#39;m 6 weeks exactly today. I went in for an ultrasound with my RE. Before the  tech began, I asked her if it&#39;s true that there&#39;s a chance there won&#39;t be a heartbeat yet, and if that&#39;s normal. She reassured me that, yes, sometimes it&#39;s normal not to see a heartbeat yet. </p>

<p>We saw a yolk sac and fetal pole, she said congratulations a few times and that everything looked good. No baby or heartbeat visible yet. I began to freak out, despite my conversation with her earlier. We then met my RE after. She told my husband &amp; I congratulations several times, then she said she would like to book a follow-up ultrasound in two weeks (8 weeks) to confirm baby and heartbeat. </p>

<p>I told her I have an 8 week appointment scheduled with a high risk OB. She then told me that &quot;we like to confirm viability here before sending you out so that it rules out a miscarriage.&quot; </p>

This is a special kind of hell for two people to go through together, and despite the strength we have gained for it I would give anything to have that innocent love back - that uncomplicated love, where you haven&#39;t failed each other deeply again and again after you have lost yet another child.  I feel like my friends have no idea what that is like.  At all.  And I envy them. </p>

Oh, man, I SO feel this.  My first couple losses, my husband was (mostly) amazing even if he didn't totally understand the depth of my feelings.  Subsequent losses have really brought out the worst in both of us.  We both occasionally lash out angrily, but we mostly ignore and compartmentalize each time we get that positive pregnancy test (not to mention each month of robot TTC sex) just so we don't have to deal with the loss that seems, at this point, likely to follow.  We can no longer afford to get feelings involved.  I think we both (secretly) feel a little bit of resentment toward the other, even though there's no apparent reason for our miscarriages.  

I know I'm making us sound like a disaster marriage right now, and I promise we're not!  But I think you're completely right that we can love each other even if we're mad, and just because we can't use third and fourth miscarriages to bring us close together, we still both very much want the family we're trying to build and love each other through the process.

I did slow down my activity‚Äî no more intense exercise, no more heavy lifting except for getting my then 22 month old into her crib and car seat. (She was really small‚Äî not sure if that even counted as heavy lifting.) I was also placed on pelvic rest until the bleeding had stopped.

I feel like there‚Äôs a lot of differing ways docs approach this, but basically, no one has seemed particularly worried either time‚Äî they seemed to be monitoring it more for my own anxiety than for any pregnancy outcome. I know that if the hematoma is very large and located close to the placenta, that can sometimes have a negative impact on the pregnancy, but that in the vast majority of cases, a hematoma is medically a non-factor in the pregnancy, and will either bleed itself out or be reabsorbed by the body. 

My first SCH started bleeding heavily around 6.5 weeks with my second pregnancy‚Äî I was sure I was miscarrying but ultrasound confirmed an intrauterine pregnancy. I want to say that one resolved by 14 or so weeks. The bleeding was very heavy and red with giant clots for a day or two and then quickly resolved to brown and stayed pretty much brown as it tapered off over the next several weeks. That pregnancy resulted in a stillbirth, most likely attributed to a cord accident, but I went into labor spontaneously at 39+1 and my water didn‚Äôt break until I had arrived at the hospital at 39+2; prior to learning the baby had no heartbeat. 

This pregnancy, the hematoma was discovered on ultrasound around 6.5 weeks. The doctor noted it wasn‚Äôt large but said he expected me to bleed a bit from it. I did, on and off, but that one largely seemed to resolve itself by reabsorption rather than by bleeding itself out. 

In all three of my pregnancies I had red bleeding around 11 weeks. In the first case (3.5 yo living child) and there was never any cause found. In the second case, the hematoma has mostly been resolved by that point and they assumed it was unrelated since it was red blood and the hematoma had been reduced to brown spotting by then. In the third case, I just kind of figured this is a thing that ‚Äúhappens‚Äù to me at this point in pregnancy, though no one has really been able to determine why. I have speculated that it has to do with the heart shaped uterus stretching at a certain growth point, but the doctors just shrug their shoulders. We couldn‚Äôt definitively say whether the hematoma was related to it in this pregnancy because it was still actively spotting on and off, but again, the baby was fine and no one was worried.  The third hematoma was fully resolved by about 16 weeks and I‚Äôm now 30+4.

Not sure if any of that helps but I‚Äôve mostly been assured that a hematoma is a stressful sideshow of pregnancy and very rarely a factor that has an impact on the health of a pregnancy. ",[],,t1_dx4w8li,False,0,[],False,"<div class=""md""><p>It was completely unrelated to my stillbirth, and in this current pregnancy, the hematoma was actually nowhere near the fetus‚Äî I have an arcuate (heart shaped) uterus and baby was up in the right side and the hematoma was in the left‚Äî I told that was a pretty common thing with this type of (otherwise inconsequential) uterine anomaly. </p>

<p>I did slow down my activity‚Äî no more intense exercise, no more heavy lifting except for getting my then 22 month old into her crib and car seat. (She was really small‚Äî not sure if that even counted as heavy lifting.) I was also placed on pelvic rest until the bleeding had stopped.</p>

<p>I feel like there‚Äôs a lot of differing ways docs approach this, but basically, no one has seemed particularly worried either time‚Äî they seemed to be monitoring it more for my own anxiety than for any pregnancy outcome. I know that if the hematoma is very large and located close to the placenta, that can sometimes have a negative impact on the pregnancy, but that in the vast majority of cases, a hematoma is medically a non-factor in the pregnancy, and will either bleed itself out or be reabsorbed by the body. </p>

<p>My first SCH started bleeding heavily around 6.5 weeks with my second pregnancy‚Äî I was sure I was miscarrying but ultrasound confirmed an intrauterine pregnancy. I want to say that one resolved by 14 or so weeks. The bleeding was very heavy and red with giant clots for a day or two and then quickly resolved to brown and stayed pretty much brown as it tapered off over the next several weeks. That pregnancy resulted in a stillbirth, most likely attributed to a cord accident, but I went into labor spontaneously at 39+1 and my water didn‚Äôt break until I had arrived at the hospital at 39+2; prior to learning the baby had no heartbeat. </p>

<p>This pregnancy, the hematoma was discovered on ultrasound around 6.5 weeks. The doctor noted it wasn‚Äôt large but said he expected me to bleed a bit from it. I did, on and off, but that one largely seemed to resolve itself by reabsorption rather than by bleeding itself out. </p>

<p>In all three of my pregnancies I had red bleeding around 11 weeks. In the first case (3.5 yo living child) and there was never any cause found. In the second case, the hematoma has mostly been resolved by that point and they assumed it was unrelated since it was red blood and the hematoma had been reduced to brown spotting by then. In the third case, I just kind of figured this is a thing that ‚Äúhappens‚Äù to me at this point in pregnancy, though no one has really been able to determine why.

Personally, I haven't been able to treat my babies the same way. I love them all immensely, but each loss has been so different. We were able to bury our first and most recent babies, but weren't able to recover the other babies' remains (just too early). For our most recent baby, we know his sex for sure and for another, I had a strong feeling it was a boy, but for the other five, we don't know and I don't have any intuition. We've named four of our babies, but haven't named the three we lost earliest. We lost them so quickly, one month after another, and so soon after our first loss which was a bit later in pregnancy. At the time, we were just in such a state of shock. Perhaps we will name them in the future. Because I only knew I was pregnant for a few days with those three, I had less time to plan for the future and I feel less aware of ""special dates"" for as well. I think all seven of our babies are equally human and I know that I love them so so so much, but for me, it's been impossible to respond the same way to each loss when the circumstances have been so different. 

I guess the mommy guilt about this isn't so different from living babies? I know so many mothers who bottle feed baby 1 and breastfeed baby 2, or baby 1 goes to daycare at 6 weeks and they're a stay-at-home mom when baby 2 is born. I sometimes worry about how my feelings will compare for living children in the future, compared to the babies we've lost too. I just keep reminding myself that nothing is ever really equal and I can't measure up how much I love each baby and compare it.

One thing that does bother me is that I feel like other people treat our losses very differently because they don't believe our earlier losses were babies. When we lost our first baby, I was sent to a horrible OB/GYN who refused to write a brief note confirming my miscarriage so we could bury the baby because, ""it was just a clump of cells."" I doubt she would have had the nerve to say something like that to a parent who had lost a baby at 40 weeks.

Though my boobs felt like a stiff soreness in the AM for the few days after AF was supposed to arrive up til the CP ended which I'd never experienced exactly. Then I had this light brown CM since like 5 days after ovulation all the way til the CP ended which was completely unusual for me. I had the flu so unsure if the extreme exhaustion and body aches had anything to do with pregnancy, and obviously a fever, though I still had it hovering around 99/100 for several days after I felt essentially better.

Just wondering if I should expect any of the same symptoms with a normal pregnancy (minus the flu lol), or was the lack of usual nipple pain and the light brown CM signs of a doomed pregnancy within just a few days after ovulation? Wondering because last cycle I felt so pregnant with all the cliche symptoms but was not at all, and this month the nipple soreness just lasted a few days and then is gone again. So I don't know whether to be excited or worried :/ too early to test as I also ovulated late (positive opk on CD 20 of a 29 day cycle which also has thrown me for a loop).

<p>Accidentally starting crying during crowded brunch with three girlfriends yesterday when GF#2 announced she&#39;s 14 weeks. GF#1 is 21 weeks and I ended up telling them that I&#39;m 7 because I didn&#39;t want anyone to feel bad for making me cry. I haven&#39;t even told my family yet although I think some suspect it from Easter so I feel slightly bad about telling friends first :(</p>

<p>My first appointment is tomorrow and I&#39;m so scared that we&#39;re not going to hear a strong heartbeat but I&#39;m trying to tell myself that the strong emotions I&#39;m feeling and crying fits are due to pregnancy hormones doing their thing!</p>

No I don't mind you asking at all - it's difficult to tell as my HCG has still been an issue due to retained tissue up until a week ago. My tests are all now coming up negative. If your HCG is still elevated then you could be getting false positives on OPKs.

I cannot speak from my own experience but I have a close friend who had to wait over a year before they got an okay to TTC, and she and her husband spent a lot of time doing stuff you cannot do when TTC/pregnant -- some of their activities I saw on Facebook were the following: 
* traveling to Zika-risk areas for cheap vacations 
* skydiving and ziplining 
* eating a lot of sushi 
* learning how to ski (my friend never learned as a kid) 
* adopting a dog 

Hope this list helps! Or maybe you have a list of your own?? There's a saying that I like, and it is this: **If you cannot avoid it, enjoy it**  If you cannot escape this year of waiting, I think you will be able to find a way to make the most out of it. 

Take all the time in the world to grieve, to cry, and to mourn, but at the end of the day, one way or another, you will become a mom and have a baby of your own.

I want to share a passage with you that was written by a Redditor years ago. I come back to it often to deal with other losses, and it always soothes me:

*Alright, here goes. I'm old. What that means is that I've survived (so far) and a lot of people I've known and loved did not. I've lost friends, best friends, acquaintances, co-workers, grandparents, mom, relatives, teachers, mentors, students, neighbors, and a host of other folks. I have no children, and I can't imagine the pain it must be to lose a child. But here's my two cents.

I wish I could say you get used to people dying. I never did. I don't want to. It tears a hole through me whenever somebody I love dies, no matter the circumstances. But I don't want it to ""not matter"". I don't want it to be something that just passes. My scars are a testament to the love and the relationship that I had for and with that person. And if the scar is deep, so was the love. So be it. Scars are a testament to life. Scars are a testament that I can love deeply and live deeply and be cut, or even gouged, and that I can heal and continue to live and continue to love. And the scar tissue is stronger than the original flesh ever was. Scars are a testament to life. Scars are only ugly to people who can't see.

As for grief, you'll find it comes in waves. When the ship is first wrecked, you're drowning, with wreckage all around you. Everything floating around you reminds you of the beauty and the magnificence of the ship that was, and is no more. And all you can do is float. You find some piece of the wreckage and you hang on for a while. Maybe it's some physical thing. Maybe it's a happy memory or a photograph. Maybe it's a person who is also floating. For a while, all you can do is float. Stay alive.

In the beginning, the waves are 100 feet tall and crash over you without mercy. They come 10 seconds apart and don't even give you time to catch your breath. All you can do is hang on and float. After a while, maybe weeks, maybe months, you'll find the waves are still 100 feet tall, but they come further apart. When they come, they still crash all over you and wipe you out. But in between, you can breathe, you can function. You never know what's going to trigger the grief. It might be a song, a picture, a street intersection, the smell of a cup of coffee. It can be just about anything...and the wave comes crashing. But in between waves, there is life.

Somewhere down the line, and it's different for everybody, you find that the waves are only 80 feet tall. Or 50 feet tall. And while they still come, they come further apart. You can see them coming. An anniversary, a birthday, or Christmas, or landing at O'Hare. You can see it coming, for the most part, and prepare yourself. And when it washes over you, you know that somehow you will, again, come out the other side. Soaking wet, sputtering, still hanging on to some tiny piece of the wreckage, but you'll come out. Take it from an old guy. The waves never stop coming, and somehow you don't really want them to. But you learn that you'll survive them. And other waves will come. And you'll survive them too. If you're lucky, you'll have lots of scars from lots of loves. And lots of shipwrecks.*",[],,t1_dx2g028,False,0,[],False,"<div class=""md""><p>I am so sorry for your loss. <em>hugs</em> </p>

At least for me, it's happened on its own as I've worked through my grief.  It's nothing to push, or force before you're ready.

I&#39;ve also been spotting / bleeding ever since my loss, but it&#39;s a very small amount at the moment. Hope that helps.</p>

If you are pregnant and there is a problem with the baby, like a chromosomal issue, this may cause low progesterone and progesterone supplementation will not fix the underlying issue with the baby.

Some women seem to have low progesterone even with healthy babies. Unfortunately, there's no way to check the baby's health at 4 weeks when you get a positive test, so this is only something we know after the fact. For these women, progesterone supplementation seems to be addressing an issue with the woman's body that interferes with the stability of the uterine lining. If the uterine lining starts shedding in the first weeks of pregnancy, even a healthy baby is probably not going to make it.

Recurrent loss is awful. I don't think anyone imagines that they will fall into this group.

I absolutely believe you are doing everything you can do to keep your babies safe. This is not your fault. Sadly, we still understand so little of the mysteries of life and death. I'm sure you've noticed that some women *don't* do everything they can to protect their baby from harm - they do drugs, they drink, they smoke, etc - and most still have living babies. Women have healthy babies in terrible circumstances, like desperate poverty and war, all the time. Sometimes there is no rhyme or reason to what happens :( Following pregnancy guidelines does not guarantee the survival of an unborn baby.

> Do I have any chance of having a healthy child with my partner? 

Yes. After three losses, the chance of the very next pregnancy ending in a living baby is very high - typically around 70% - even without a diagnosis or any treatment. The chances of eventually having a living baby are even higher.

I'm also so glad that you're talking to your OB. There are a lot of treatable issues that can improve the odds, though it's sometimes hard to know how a particular problem is contributing to your losses. About 50% of couples who suffer recurrent loss never get answers, so it's good to be prepared for that as well. Thankfully, ""unexplained"" recurrent loss has a very good prognosis - the vast majority of couples eventually have a living baby, many have a surviving baby the very next time they try. If testing doesn't reveal anything, your doctor might still recommend trying a few medications, ""just in case."" Baby aspirin and progesterone are common suggestions.

I'm also so sorry you feel alone. It is a lonely place to be. You aren't alone here - there are unfortunately quite a few of us here that have suffered 3+ losses. My husband and I have had seven losses and after tons and tons of testing and seeing so many specialists, still no answers. But every specialist we've seen told us that they were confident we'd eventually have a baby.  Several suspected a blood clotting issue, so we'll be trying lovenox/heparin as soon as we conceive.

I think the spiritual anguish you are going through is also normal, though obviously very challenging. My husband and I are Catholic. It sometimes helps to reflect on the suffering of Jesus and Mary. Those of us who have lost innocent babies know some if the pain Mary must have felt at the foot of the cross, watching her own innocent son die. Certainly, Jesus and Mary weren't spared suffering, despite being ""good."" There are also so many holy men and women who longed for children, only to suffer infertility or to have children and lose them. St Elizabeth and Zachariah, from the Bible. St Anne and Joachim, Mary's parents. St. Zellie and Martin. Not to mention all the men and women who suffered in other terrible ways for our faith. Faith doesn't guarantee an easy life. Your trials do not mean that you are doing something wrong or that God doesn't love you. It's ok to bring all your feelings to the table in prayer, including the anger, bitterness, and hopelessness. God suffers with us and he's big enough to take all our feelings. There's a group on Reddit called catholicttc, which has some posts about topics like this. Facebook also has some Christian support groups - there's a wonderful Catholic group, though some members are from different denominations, but you could also find something more specific to your beliefs with the search bar. Happy to PM you the name of the Catholic group too.

My husband and I have had seven losses and after tons and tons of testing and seeing so many specialists, still no answers. But every specialist we&#39;ve seen told us that they were confident we&#39;d eventually have a baby.  Several suspected a blood clotting issue, so we&#39;ll be trying lovenox/heparin as soon as we conceive.</p>

<p>I think the spiritual anguish you are going through is also normal, though obviously very challenging. My husband and I are Catholic. It sometimes helps to reflect on the suffering of Jesus and Mary. Those of us who have lost innocent babies know some if the pain Mary must have felt at the foot of the cross, watching her own innocent son die. Certainly, Jesus and Mary weren&#39;t spared suffering, despite being &quot;good.&quot; There are also so many holy men and women who longed for children, only to suffer infertility or to have children and lose them. St Elizabeth and Zachariah, from the Bible. St Anne and Joachim, Mary&#39;s parents. St. Zellie and Martin. Not to mention all the men and women who suffered in other terrible ways for our faith. Faith doesn&#39;t guarantee an easy life. Your trials do not mean that you are doing something wrong or that God doesn&#39;t love you. It&#39;s ok to bring all your feelings to the table in prayer, including the anger, bitterness, and hopelessness. God suffers with us and he&#39;s big enough to take all our feelings. There&#39;s a group on Reddit called catholicttc, which has some posts about topics like this. Facebook also has some Christian support groups - there&#39;s a wonderful Catholic group, though some members are from different denominations, but you could also find something more specific to your beliefs with the search bar. Happy to PM you the name of the Catholic group too.</p>

<p>Edit: My husband and I lost our first baby at 23 in our first year of marriage. So hard and I&#39;m sorry you know that so well.</p>

Anyhow I'm recovering and this most certainly will be a long process. I'm not even sure if I ever want to go down this TTC road again. It's up in the air...if we do decide to TTC it won't be for another year or two. 

Thank you in advance for your input. ",[],,t1_dwyx9a7,False,0,[],False,"<div class=""md""><p>Hello Alumni&#39;s!

I saw your other comment about the &quot;heavy period&quot; myth and I think that&#39;s in the same boat. Sometimes it seems like everyone believes they&#39;re an expert on pregnancy loss, all while spreading horribly untrue &quot;awareness&quot; :( Just infuriating! I think losing my babies would be half as painful if it weren&#39;t compounded by all the pain of dealing with stupid, insensitive people ALL THE TIME.</p>

Many antidepressants have delayed ovulation, reduced cervical mucus, and shortened luteal phase as possible side effects for women. Antidepressants can also lower sperm count in men. For both sexes, antidepressants can effect libido. Not great side effects to deal with while TTC :( Of course, many people don't notice any of these, or they notice some of them but still don't have any issues conceiving. Still, it might be worth asking your doctor or pharmacist about the likelihood of these side effects. If you're charting, you can also keep an eye out for any changes in your charts in the first couple months of being on a new medication.

I started taking Zoloft a few months after my stillbirth‚Äî I was managing alright but my irregular cycles would send me into wild swings of anxiety and every short luteal phase would trigger a tailspin. My midwife and therapist both agreed that Zoloft would be a good choice for me‚Äî it‚Äôs the most commonly prescribed anxiety/depression medication for women with postpartum mood issues, if I‚Äôm not mistaken. My midwife knew I was TTC and authorized it anyways and as far as I know it is breastfeeding friendly as well. Of course like every medication it is not without it‚Äôs risks, but my team and I decided that the risk of not taking it and just feeling like I was buzzing with anxiety constantly outweighed the relatively minute risks of being on it during a pregnancy. And for what it‚Äôs worth I‚Äôm currently 30 weeks with a so far very healthy pregnancy and I do think my anxiety has been kept under control for the most part. Obviously I still have my moments and they ebb and flow but I think being on the Zoloft is overall helping to maintain some stability.

My midwife started me on 50mg. At first, I had trouble sleeping on this dose. My therapist suggested I back off to 25 mg for about a week and then work back up to 50. That resolved the sleeping issue but not so much the anxiety issue. The midwife bumped me up to 100mg upon a follow up 3 weeks after I began taking it. My therapist advised me to do 75 mg for a few days and then move up to the 100mg, and I‚Äôve been at that level ever since. Other than those initial days of insomnia, I haven‚Äôt noticed any side effects. I anticipate eventually coming off of it by tapering my way down, but for now I don‚Äôt want to rock the boat on something that‚Äôs working. I fell pregnant after a month or two on the medication. My RE also was aware I was on it and had no objection when he began treating me. 

My advice to you, if you do choose medication, is to gradually work into your dose, don‚Äôt be afraid to ask for an increased dose if you feel you need it, (my therapist told me that she didn‚Äôt actually have any patient who had been effectively managed on a dose as low as 50mg), and to be communicative about how it‚Äôs going with both your therapist and your prescribing physician, if you are going to have someone else prescribe it. (Your OB is a great place to start, especially when TTC is a factor.) Expect it to take a week or two to feel any effect, and 6 weeks for a full effect. If your doctor and/or therapist don‚Äôt check in on this development regularly, then bring it up to them so that they can assess its efficacy as well. 

Good luck‚Äî I know the idea of taking a medication is daunting, especially when you are trying to get pregnant, but effectively managed, it can be a really valuable tool in your toolkit to maintain your mental health, which will ultimately be reflected in your physical health.

I managed by reminding myself a few things:

* I can't do anything to change the outcome/loss wasn't my fault

I&#39;ve been through the TTC sex period four times now (five I guess, since we&#39;re back to it), but I don&#39;t have four living children.  I feel like this is such a specific type of exhaustion that no one else can understand.  No, TTC sex is not fun anymore.  I&#39;ve literally been TTC for years and, yeah, I&#39;ve gotten pregnant a few times, and then that&#39;s just disappeared and I have to start from scratch all over again.  I&#39;m exhausted. </p>

In the case of my son's condition, it comes in a few forms.  It is almost never diagnosed prenatally.  Everything develops and looks good by ultrasound.  Things just don't function as they should.  Our son had a particularly severe form which is very rare--only a handful of cases have been documented and the first cases were only described about 12 years ago.  For less severe forms, only 10% can be diagnosed via general genetic screens like microarrays.  For the other 90%, doctors need to have the diagnosis first, and then take a careful look at specific genes.  If they don't see the physical and functional traits to make a likely diagnosis, then they won't be able to find the underlying genetic issue, either.

Adding to the complexity, my son's condition has variable and incomplete ""penetrance"", meaning that while the disorder can cause more than 100 types of problems, different people have different subsets and severities of those issues.  So what doctors see as symptoms vary from person to person.  

In addition, the babies who survive to term or to their first birthdays (from whom we know the most about the disease), are the ones with fewer issues.  (Often it doesn't get diagnosed until they are 6-12 months old--until then, the babies seem normally healthy.) We really know nothing about how many babies are miscarried or stillborn due to having more severe manifestations of the disease.  I suspect part of the reason my son's severe form has been reported so rarely in the medical literature is in part because few babies survive long enough for it to be diagnosed. 

This is what I've learned from my son's condition.  There are so many limits to what even modern medicine can tell us.  Or do for us.  (Even knowing my son's diagnosis, there was nothing substantive that medicine could offer him.)  It's frustrating and hard to accept.    

I don't think it's really helpful for me to speculate about what your son had.  I will say that although it feels to you as though one minute he was healthy, and the next not, there's a reasonable chance that his health started declining earlier.  As my husband and I learned, there's a lot an ultrasound *cannot* see.  It might be able to see blood flow, but it can't tell if the blood cells are healthy.  Mature blood cells normally live for months.  So if he didn't have enough, and was pumping out immature cells...it's unlikely the problem started the day you delivered.  

In fetuses, red blood cells are produced early on by the liver, and only in the 3rd trimester does the bone marrow start to take over.  Did his bone marrow have problems taking over?  Was there something that interfered with the lifespan of the blood cells, such that they didn't survive as long as they should?  Does what happened to Archer have a connection to what happened to his twin?  Or was the loss of his twin simply a terrible coincidence?  

I'm sure you've asked your doctors all these things, and not gotten answers that help.  I feel bad, because if things had played out differently for us, we could have been in your shoes: not learning there was a problem until my son became distressed during labor.  

I wish we could give you the answers and closure you're searching for.  We might not be able to do that, but we're certainly here to listen and sympathize.  The moderators here are actually starting a new weekly ""Grief and Memorial"" thread that you might find helpful (see side bar).

The OPKs I use suggest not going to the bathroom 4 hrs before testing, and to limit fluid intake 2 hrs before.  I've found that my OPKs have more variation when I don't follow these instructions.

I almost missed it!  So if your cycles have been a little wonky since your loss, you might see variation like this from month to month.

Also, since it's possible to ovulate 24 hrs after you get a positive OPK, it means that if you just rely on these, you might get O-1, and O-0....but you'll miss the earlier days in the FW.  I think OPKs, in combo with temps, are helpful for figuring out when you're out of the FW, but not necessarily when you should start.

I had a McDonald cerclage placed at 12 weeks this time around.

I went in to the doctor today for a sameday appointment because I was initially worried that I had a UTI. Turns out the was clean, which is good news. Also talked to the doctor about this tightening I've been having of my uterus. It's not painful, and isn't accompanied by an change in discharge or anything else. My whole uterus just gets really, really hard. We talked for a while, and she seemed kind of confused and uncertain. She began asking about my medical history a little more, and how my doctors in the past have been responding to any symptoms I gave them.

Last pregnancy, and once this pregnancy, I got what I thought was braxton hicks, as early as 13 weeks, and not very often. My uterus would lump up on one side, usually the left. It was not painful, and would go away within a couple minutes. All doctors, when i told them about this, said it's normal, but never really identified it. So she was curious about this phenomenon. 

But the uterine tightening I've been getting the past couple days is different. It just gets rock hard around the entire uterus. It is not painful, and I'm not sure I would even notice it was happening unless I felt it with my hand. But it is a change.

She basically said, ""I don't think this is anything scary. I think this is your uterus either reacting to growing, or reacting to the cerclage. As long as your discharge does not change, there's nothign to worry about.""

But she also added, very sensitively, that if this was a precursor of preterm delivery, there's nothing that can be done about it anyway. Cerclage IS the prevention until I reach viability, there's nothing else.

Now, I really like my doctors, because they take the time to explain the reasons why they do what they do. They aren't putting me on progesterone, because according to them, the literature doesn't back it up in cases of incompetent cervix, suppositories can introduce infection, and shots are stressful. They've explained that I won't be coming in for extra checkups, ultrasounds, or cervical length checks, unless there are alarming symptoms, because that causes added stress and there shouldn't be any problems after the cerclage is placed. Today, she explained that as a policy, they don't put pregnant people in pre-viability, preterm labor on anti-contraction meds because the literature says it doesn't work.

But here I am, looking at these accounts online, and most of these people with IC get biweekly ultrasounds or checkups, some sort of progesterone, and I've seen a few where even if they start contracting at 18 weeks, they get put on meds to stop contractions. I want these doctors to explain what they think scientifically, and still give me an option. But I don't know if I can call and say, ""You know, I understand why you usually don't put people with IC on progesterone, but my husband and I decided that if there are no negative side effects, we would really like a weekly progesterone shot."" And you can be god damn sure that this time, if I'm sent to the ER for preterm contractions, that I will demand anti-contraction medication. I want to do everything I can! I don't want to leave the hospital with another loss, saying, ""If only our doctors had allowed us to...""

Another part of me is thinking, ""I've been bringing up the weird braxton hicks thing for both of my pregnancies. Why has every single doctor brushed it off as irrelevant?"" And especially the way the doctor seemed confused today, I'm thinking, ""What if it's not incompetent cervix at all? What if it's irritable uterus? Or something else?""

* My Prolactin was on the high end of normal, but not outside the range. We did attempt to lower it with meds and it came down a bit. But one of the biggest things high Prolactin does is actually keep you from conceiving, and I didn't have that issue.
* My CD21 progesterone tests were consistently low, but this is likely explained by poor egg quality not much else. I did start on Progesterone supplements post-ovulation and had slightly better numbers. But still had losses after.
* My karyotyping had an abnormal result but nobody could decide if it was impacting my fertility. It is not a known fertility issue like translocations/etc. The doctors suggested testing my parents and we found that my mom has it/passed it to me, so it was deemed an unlikely cause since she has it and was 3/3 with pregnancies.

We also genetically tested our 2nd baby and found no reason for his passing.

So I literally was put on a ""try again and we'll see how it goes"" plan.

I just can&#39;t understand people who make a gender announcement to someone (2 weeks!) after their stillbirth, as if nothing happened.  Or who use the same baby name, as if it&#39;s no big deal that now you have to live with the existence of a little boy who&#39;s not only the same age as your son would have been, but even has the same name.  </p>

<p>One facilitator in my support group said that after her stillbirth, she grew apart from/stopped being friends with some people.  If it needs to happen, it needs to happen.</p>
