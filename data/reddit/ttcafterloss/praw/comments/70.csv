My losses were conceived very easily (cycles 1 and 5, but with a two year gap in between) and I'm now on cycle 20  since re-starting TTC again. Infertility is more of a slow burn than the intense pain of loss, but it still hurts.

We've been working with an RE since July 2018, and just finished our third round of medicated TI. We're planning to do IUI next cycle, with the current one a break from treatments that was unfortunately forced by work travel.

For mental health I find having a plan of what to do next really helpful. We went the slow route of 3x medicated TI and are planning to do 3xIUI before moving to IVF, and it really helps me to know that I have a number of options left.

First of all, I’m sorry for your loss.  And sorry to anyone if I’m stepping on toes by commenting without an intro. 

I could have written your question almost exactly. I was searching ovulation after miscarriage and found this thread. From what my OB has told me, you can actually have anything from an anovulatory cycle to a “normal” cycle to early or late ovulation after an early miscarriage.  Anything is “normal.”

I’ve had 3 miscarriages and each experience has been different. The first was a m/mc at 8 weeks. I had a d&c and didn’t ovulate until 34 days after the procedure. (though I’m uncertain as to how many days it was past my hCG being below 5.)

My second was actually an early second tri loss secondary to a bloodstream infection. My levels took 25 days post m/c to zero out and I ovulated 15 days later. 

This time my tested levels never made it above 330 (but I think they had started declining by the time that draw was) and I started bleeding on 1/3. I counted that as day 1 of my cycle as well, but my beta last Wednesday (on “CD 5”) was still 123. So, it’s not possible for that to be actually CD 5 or even the start of a cycle, but my temps have been in pre O territory since 1/3 when I started bleeding. My hCG was <5 on  Monday, “CD 12”. I had a positive OPK yesterday, which couldn’t be hCG as it’s below 5, but I think it was just a weird LH surge. 

I’m sorry you’re going through this. I would think your actual CD 1 would be 1/10 or 1/11 considering your beta may have been <9 in the evening of 1/10 depending on the time of your blood draw. If treated like a “normal” cycle you wouldn’t expect O until CD 20/21 if you typically O on CD 14.

Originally I was thinking about cost of successful baby not all these failed pregnancies and appointments and such. Like how much is it going to take? The whole thing is crazy.</p>

From the [article](https://www.spin.com/2018/11/nick-cave-death-grief-son-letter/):

The question comes from Cynthia in Shelburne Falls, Vermont, who recounts the recent deaths of her father, sister, and first love, explaining that they still communicate with her through dreams. She asks Cave whether his son Arthur, who died tragically in 2015, maintains a similar connection with him and his wife Susie. Considering it has Spin’s staff choked up, we’ve included Cave’s full response below.

>Dear Cynthia,  
>  
>  
This is a very beautiful question and I am grateful that you have asked it. It seems to me, that if we love, we grieve. That’s the deal. That’s the pact. Grief and love are forever intertwined. Grief is the terrible reminder of the depths of our love and, like love, grief is non-negotiable. There is a vastness to grief that overwhelms our minuscule selves. We are tiny, trembling clusters of atoms subsumed within grief’s awesome presence. It occupies the core of our being and extends through our fingers to the limits of the universe. Within that whirling gyre all manner of madnesses exist; ghosts and spirits and dream visitations, and everything else that we, in our anguish, will into existence. These are precious gifts that are as valid and as real as we need them to be. They are the spirit guides that lead us out of the darkness.  
>  
>  
I feel the presence of my son, all around, but he may not be there. I hear him talk to me, parent me, guide me, though he may not be there. He visits Susie in her sleep regularly, speaks to her, comforts her, but he may not be there. Dread grief trails bright phantoms in its wake. These spirits are ideas, essentially. They are our stunned imaginations reawakening after the calamity. Like ideas, these spirits speak of possibility. Follow your ideas, because on the other side of the idea is change and growth and redemption. Create your spirits. Call to them. Will them alive. Speak to them. It is their impossible and ghostly hands that draw us back to the world from which we were jettisoned; better now and unimaginably changed.

It’s easier said than done, and it’s something I work on every day. I am so happy to be pregnant again, but my brand of happiness is sooooo much different than it is for most other people who haven’t experienced loss like I have. It makes it hard to relate.</p>

<p>I hope the anxiety never comes for you and that you can allow yourself to find the joy in the now, no matter what the future may be. You and your baby deserve happiness and love. 💕 </p>

The goal will be to keep your TSH under 2.5, which I believe is currently agreed upon as a good range for pregnancy/TTC. 

In pregnancy, your body’s demand for thyroid hormone increases, so your TSH will have to be checked more frequently, and your medication dose will likely need to be adjusted (mine went from 50 mcg to 112 mcg in the first 4 months!). Then you’ll likely need to titrate back down after pregnancy.

It’s hard to say whether or not this contributed to your losses, but my understanding is that it’s unlikely. More severe thyroid abnormalities can cause pregnancy loss and birth defects, but a TSH of 5ish really isn’t all that high, relatively speaking. Were your T4 levels checked? T4 is your actual thyroid hormone (TSH is a different hormone that stimulates the release of T4, so it gets high in response to low T4 and low in response to high T4), and the “subclinical hypothyroidism” that others have mentioned is when your TSH is high but your T4 is normal. This is treated in TTC/pregnancy these days, but it didn’t used to be, and there’s actually still some controversy surrounding it, from what I understand. So anyway, I highly doubt this would have been a major contributor to your losses.

Hope that was somewhat helpful!

I had a family member have 2 kids in the time we didn't. She boasted, ""I didn't even have time for my period between!"" I mean, it felt like boasting at the time, but I'm sure she was just commenting about how gobsmacked she was to be pregnant again so soon. 

My MIL also loves to bring up stories about women who are too old to have babies-- and those women are years younger than me. It's so hard for me to perceive that as anything other than a direct insult. When she starts that noise, I look directly at husband say, ""Well, that was fun. We're leaving now."" I've done this within 5 minutes of us walking in the door. He is baffled and has never heard his mom telling these stories... it's like she always does it only within ear shot of me. Anyway, it costs her time with her kid as a natural consequence of telling stories that are mean to his wife of an advanced maternal age. 

You're not at the point of letting there be natural consequences yet though. You're still in the healing space. I have a meditation that I used-- the kind of meditation where you envision things in your head and explore them in detail. I'm copying this from an earlier post, and I hope it can help you: One is that I am a small forest. I've been razed in a scorched Earth attack. Deep under the ashes and deep under the dirt, tiny seeds are insulated from the fires above. They winter over and come spring, the dry ground becomes moist and the sun warms the chill earth. The seeds begin to grow roots and little green sprouts unfurl. The forest will regenerate. When I feel broken, I hibernate, protecting and insulating myself for regrowth. The new forest will be bigger and brighter and more diverse than the old. It will be the same forest, but so different.

I'm very sorry for your loss. You are right and wrong about your boyfriend's sister. She is hurting you, but she's not doing it because she's malicious. She's doing it because you are hurt so deeply that you need serious healing before you have the strength to be around her without feeling your wounds like they are fresh all over again.

You are hurting, and you have good reason to be. But I don’t think she’s intentionally doing anything to hurt you, she’s just excited about her pregnancy (the same way I’m sure you were about yours) and wanting to share it with her brother. He’s going to be the baby’s uncle, and that’s important. 

As much as it is a stab in the heart for all of us ladies in this group to see others having normal pregnancies and healthy babies, no one has a baby to hurt someone else, they are just living their lives and focused on their own families. You can’t expect them to hold off on getting pregnant or not do anything to celebrate their own happiness. It’s really likely that all of us on here who got to the point where pregnancies were in the open unintentionally hurt someone else (via card, Facebook post, etc.) who was going through their own baby struggles. 

So I’d say maybe talk to her and tell her that you are not at a good point yet to be involved in all of this, but don’t want to get in the way of the uncle relationship that is going to form. Ask her if she can just keep her brother in the loop and don’t send cards and such to both of you, and you will step back into it all when you are ready.

<p>You are hurting, and you have good reason to be. But I don’t think she’s intentionally doing anything to hurt you, she’s just excited about her pregnancy (the same way I’m sure you were about yours) and wanting to share it with her brother. He’s going to be the baby’s uncle, and that’s important. </p>

<p>As much as it is a stab in the heart for all of us ladies in this group to see others having normal pregnancies and healthy babies, no one has a baby to hurt someone else, they are just living their lives and focused on their own families. You can’t expect them to hold off on getting pregnant or not do anything to celebrate their own happiness.

I wonder if I am still paying that price. 

I was a soldier's daughter and for a short while, a soldier's wife. There is a lot of stigma around being weak, around making the wrong choices, even as a child or a civilian. I can only imagine how much worse it is for a soldier.

My husband and I got pregnant on our wedding night because I planned our wedding for the day I thought I would ovulate. It was hard to lose that pregnancy 11 weeks later when I was technically 13 weeks pregnant. We tried again, got help, and got pregnant again with twins. We lost that pregnancy, too. We kept trying and kept ramping up the assistive technologies, but nothing has resulted in a take home baby yet. We are waiting to find out of IVF#1 will get us a take home baby.

I've been in a lot of therapy to heal. I've been diagnosed with PTSD. I have declined additional EMDR treatment after a few tries. The therapist had little electrodes in my hands that gave mild but uncomfortable shocks as I repeated my story over and over. I didn't find it healing and found that it just made me feel worse. I am still doing talk therapy with a different therapist with the clear boundary that I want to discuss what's happening in my life now... Not what is in my past. 

Your attacker hurt you and took precious pieces of you and broke them but you are not broken. You are trying to have a baby again! That is such incredible strength. You stayed in the military-- I am in awe that you can go into work in that environment after what you endured. Your attacker knocked you down, but you are rebuilding.

TTC in and of itself can be traumatic. Losses are traumatic. You have both of these traumas plus the attack. 

When I am angry, I remember that the best revenge is a life well lived. I was taught by soldiers to always strive for excellence. Now I strive for peace, for happiness, for pleasure in the moment. I redefined excellence as good food, good friends, puppies to love, and a comfortable, harmonious home.

When I feel undone, I hibernate. I have a few meditations that I envision. One is that I am a small forest. I've been razed in a scorched Earth attack. Deep under the ashes and deep under the dirt, tiny seeds are insulated from the fires above. They winter over and come spring, the dry ground becomes moist and the sun warms the chill earth. The seeds begin to grow roots and little green sprouts unfurl. The forest will regenerate. When I feel broken, I hibernate, protecting and insulating myself for regrowth. The new forest will be bigger and brighter and more diverse than the old. It will be the same forest, but so different. 

Resilience is a precious commodity when dealing with TTC. Do things that build yours. Avoid things that drain your resilience. Envision your resilience like a well of water. Don't let anyone sink a sump pump in it. Make sure yours doesn't run dry. You can't control the rain, but you can do things that replenish your resilience. I like to spend time in nature, to read, to quilt, and to play video games. I like to get a solid 9 hours of sleep at night.

I hope some of this will be helpful for you. I wish you all the best.

I’m not a medical professional, but I wanted to share what we learned through our experience. We TFMR for chromosomal abnormalities and a giant omphalocele on 12/19. The genetic counselor also told us we had a 1% chance of a giant omphalocele in any subsequent pregnancy.

You friend has struggles. She's married to someone who isn't fulfilling the role she wanted him to as father to their children. She wants more children, and she loves the man... but there is a big piece missing. She could leave, but she could also try to make peace with it and have another kid or three. 

You have struggles. Losses are so hard, and they drain the resilience right out of you. They take all the parts of you that are caring and empathetic and dry them right out. 

Both of you have bowls that are not quite full enough, but for different reasons. She got the take-home baby, and you picked a keeper of a husband.

It's her kid though that has the saddest bowl of all. A dad who just isn't interested is a terrible thing to endure, and it will matter deeply to the child for her entire life if he doesn't start taking an interest. 

I'm the biggest supporter of limiting contact with people and events that drain your resilience, especially when TTC, and most especially when TTC after loss. If she drains your resilience with her pitiful bowl, then limit contact. It's a hard thing to do, but you absolutely have to come first. I lost a lot of friends during our 6 years of TTC, and it seemed like the friendships dropped like flies after every miscarriage. I don't actually miss those friendships though. For all that they meant to me at the time, the friendships that didn't last were the ones that reached their expiration dates. 

And inevitably, when I found myself sitting around thinking, ""Wow. I have no friends left,"" I'd randomly get a call from someone I hadn't spoken to in a while... or I'd run into someone at the store. And, a new friendship would start up.

I did have one friend, who currently has 4 kids, but who also had 3 miscarriages call me up to tell me she was pregnant with #4 at the same time I found out about my third pregnancy. I lost my pregnancy just a few weeks later, while she had her baby several months later. For whatever reason, it never hurt me to hear about her baby #4. I craved news-- I made a baby quilt and sent it to her for her baby. I just felt so much empathy for her baby #4 when I couldn't even bring myself to show the slightest bit of interest in other people's first pregnancy. I hated pregnant women and mothers and people with happy little brats in their lives, except for this one friend with 3 kids and a fourth on the way due within week of my lost pregnancy. Sorry to ramble, but what I'm trying to say is that when you find it hard to support a friend, it's okay to pull back. When it's genuine and easy to care and empathize, do it... and if it's too hard, it's okay to distance yourself from her.

Your first loss, then your first rainbow, and now this.  As if any of us needed more proof that the universe isn't fair.  

My TFMR was later, so it was an induction, not a D&E.  Others will be more helpful about that.  

With regards to milk coming in, in addition to what margierose mentioned, my post-partum care info said that sage and mint teas help--I drank a lot of those in the week after my induction, along with wearing a sports bra.  My breasts got uncomfortable (I even considered showering in a bikini top for support), but didn't have leaking.  One thing to avoid is hand expression.  It offers some women temporary relief, but tells the body to make more milk.  

We really cherished the momentos we have from our son's birth.  At 17 weeks, there aren't as many options for memory making, but your hospital make handprints and footprints.  (We put ours in a mini-book for the baby, along with our ultrasounds.)  

Not sure if you know baby's sex or not.  Some people feel conflicted about finding out and/or naming the baby.  If you've had an amnio to confirm the diagnosis, the sex is almost certainly in that report. (If you don't find out now, but change your mind later).  

Also, not sure what practices our in your region, but we were asked at the hospital about arrangements for the baby (private burial, private cremation, or having the hospital cremate the remains).  There's no right or wrong choice, but some people (understandably) find it upsetting to be told for the first time at the hospital that their baby's remains would be cremated en mass with ""medical waste"" if they don't make private arrangements.  

In our case, we already knew what we wanted and where we wanted the cremation done.  So we brought the information to the hospital with us, gave it to a social worker at the hospital, and she did the communicating with the funeral home.  We just had to go to there to sign the paperwork and drop off the items we wanted cremated with the baby.  

When we first learned our baby was sick, and might have something very serious, at first I was very detached.  But then I realized that whether I had two more weeks with our baby, or a longer lifetime, I wanted to make the most of whatever I had.  

After we got the final diagnosis and make the decision for a TFMR, we tried to make that last time special.  We ""took"" the baby for a hike, and to a nice dinner, and various things we wouldn't get to do later.  That last time the three of us had together will always be special, and when milestones have come up, we revisit some of those places and things.

I’m sorry you’re in a similar spot. I was almost 18 weeks at the time of my procedure. 

Honestly, the D&E itself was a breeze for me, though I know I’m just one experience of many. The laminaria sucked while being inserted, but the cramping quickly went away when the doctor got out of my cervix, and I went home and drank a bottle of wine with my husband and ate a bunch of cookies and felt physically fine. My procedure was about 20 hours after the laminaria. I got to the hospital, they got me all comfy, I had an IV with saline and anti-anxiety (my request, advocate for it if you need it). I was starting to cramp by the time they wheeled me back, but nothing horrible. I’ve had anesthesia a few times before, so one minute I was talking to the surgeon and the next thing I knew I was waking up in recovery. For about 20 minutes after waking up, it felt like I had just had rough sex, but those feelings dissipated quickly. I was bleeding but not terribly. The hardest part of waking up from anesthesia is that you feel really vulnerable and emotional, so combined with pregnancy loss, I was kind of sobbing for a while (my husband came back and hung out with me while I cried and drank ginger ale). They made me finish a bag of saline drip before I left, but by the time I got home (about 45 minutes drive) I felt physically fine, could walk around, and felt pretty normal. The next day I ran errands because my body felt ok and I needed to leave the house. 

Prepare yourself for your milk to come in; they mentioned it at the hospital but I wasn’t ready for how uncomfortable it would be. I was in tight sports bras for about two weeks and started putting cabbage leaves in my bra - it felt like my boobs had a fever. It was a bit of a punch in the gut after all that had happened. It’s also impossible to prepare yourself for the feeling of emptiness you wake up to. That was really hard. I’m lucky to have an amazing therapist who helped me process the whole thing. 

I’ve written a novel here, I hope everything goes smoothly for you - I’ll be thinking of you and hoping for the best during such a shitty time.

I’m sorry you’re in this position. I also recommend the group Ending a Wanted Pregnancy - through their website you can be granted access to a private Facebook group that I’ve found so helpful. </p>

I won't go into too many details, but here are a few thoughts/some context.

This paper came out of the larger EAGER study, which was studying whether baby aspirin improved things like conception rates, time to conception, miscarriage rates, live births, etc.  

Because the broader study wasn't explicitly designed to compare e.g. attempting to conceive 0-3 months post-MC vs. 4+ months post-MC, the two groups have some differences.  For example, the latter group on average were slightly older, with slightly older partners.  Their health stats were slightly less favorable (BMI, smoking, alcohol consumption).  They were on average more likely to not have an education beyond high school.  And were more likely to have received a diagnosis of ""subfertility"".  Because of these differences, the study authors are careful to note that we shouldn't conclude that waiting >3 months post-MC to TTC results in worse outcomes.  (Because they can't rule out the role of these other factors)  Farthest they're willing to go is to say their data suggest it's generally safe for women to start trying again in <3 months, if they would like to. 

The next thing that's important to note is that they followed couples for ~6 cycles once they started trying.  So for the group that starting TTCing within 0-3 month post-MC, that 69% is those that became pregnant again in their first 6 cycles of trying.  It's *not* those that became pregnant again ever.  Of the remaining 30%, many probably also conceived, and went on to have healthy babies, it just took them a little longer.  

In terms of live birth rates, the numbers put miscarriage rates for this group at ~25%.  Which sounds high...but when you look at estimates of miscarriage rates for the general population, it's in that 20-30% range.  So overall these women weren't more likely to have miscarriage than anyone else.  (Though anyone who has two losses in a row attributed to stats like these and ""shitty luck"" will find zero comfort in that.)  

One other take away from the paper that I found helpful was that only a minority of women got pregnant very soon after their loss.  For me, it took the pressure off of our early months of TTCAL.  

So the take home is *not* that trying again is futile.  It's that 1/3-1/2 of women will achieve the pregnancy that results in an LC *within roughly ~6 cycles of TTCing again*, give or take.  Others will need more time, often just due to the nature of TTCing, conception, and MC rates.  

ETA (per the other comment): the 0-3 mo. group and the 4+ month TTC groups had roughly the same numbers of women being treated with aspirin vs. not, so that wasn't a factor in the differing statistics.  And roughly 2/3 of women had just had 1 loss prior to the study, the remainder had had 2.  (No one with more was included.)  Roughly half of women had no LC's, the other have had at least one LC.",[],,t1_edomj2d,False,0,[],False,"<div class=""md""><p>I read this study pretty thoroughly a year ago.

I wasn't given much, if any information, about what to expect symptom wise after receiving the shots.

So, I'll give you the TMI version of what I went through to hopefully not scare you but put something on the what-might-be-normal-spectrum for the coming weeks because a point of reference would have been game changer for me mentally:

* I was given 2 shots of methotrexate on Dec 7th, first pregnancy, 2 months of trying 
* I was bleeding heavily the 3 weeks prior to the shots and 1 week after getting the shot I passed a golf ball sized clot (it was a bloody gross mess but I thought ok the shots did their job, this must be over)
* I continued to bleed through 2 pads a day for 2.5 weeks, it just started tapering off to only spotting these last few days
* On several occasions, including after passing the clot, I had excruciating, curled in a ball cramps that lasted about an hour 
* I was very bloated and had a hard time buttoning my pants 
* I've felt fat, tired and disgusting like having your worst period except lasting for over a month 

All I can say is- advocate for yourself, you know your body better than anyone, speak up and ask questions! I just wanted this to be put behind me as quickly as possible and move on but it takes time. Be patient with yourself and body as it heals, I have to keep reminding myself of that too.

The sperm can survive inside you for a few days so there's no need to BD every single day.

Your app can't tell you exactly when you will ovulate and it is making an estimate based on your history or the average 28-day cycle. In the average cycle, you ovulate 2 weeks after your period, which is why your app is telling you 1/18. It is saying you are fertile until 1/19, because it does not know when during the day you will actually ovulate. So if you ovulate very late in the night on 1/18, technically you could still be fertile on 1/19. The egg does not have a long life-span however so typically the day you ovulate you are no longer fertile the next day. 

Also, your cycle might be off following your loss.

I do still think about the group occasionally and wish for the best for all of them. </p>

So an app that worked off assuming my 28-day cycle wouldn't give me the right timing for ovulation.  (I *was* temping and using OPKs after my loss, so I had a sense of what was going on.  I also suspect, based on how dark the OPKs, that one or two of those first cycles might have been anovulatory.)

In general, each cycle, you have roughly a 1 in 3, 1 in 4 chance of getting pregnant, with good timing.  The best chance of conception is when sex happens on ovulation day or the two days prior, but even sex as early as 5 days prior can result in a pregnancy.  Sex *after* ovulation day is too late.  

The research says that sex every other day during this fertile window is just as good as e.g. every day. Usually, it's not 100% clear when ovulation happens, so it's not uncommon to go a day or two extra. (Even with OPKs, they say 24-48 hrs after a ""positive"", and sometimes people get positives two days in a row.)  

Sex and TTCAL can be challenging/emotional, especially when you're just starting/getting back into it.  Not temping or using OPK's can help take some of the stress/attention off.  At the same time, it might mean that your timing isn't ideal.   And that can be okay, actually.

Qualitative basically gives you the results of a ""yes"" or ""no"" when detecting hcg. Does it detect HCG? yes you're pregnant. No - you're not pregnant.

Quantitative gives you the count of HCG so yes there is HCG its at 40ml. If its not higher than 25ml its considered a ""possible pregnancy"". Higher means a definitive pregnancy. 

So the reason why I bring up these two different types of blood tests is cause all HPT's use the qualitative method of pregnancy testing. Which is why its NOT a reliable method to see if your count is rising or not. Especially so cause you need extremely concentrated urine as well to see a positive if you're testing early. If you google around as well you will find that some people got a dark line at 28ml of HCG. Some people only got a dark line at 1000ml of HCG. So please don't read too much into the line darkness.

As someone who had to TFMR illegally and traveled to a different country I really appreciate sharing the awareness. Where we live there are no abort!on clinics. At least not legal. There's nothing. You have to carry to term so that the medical staff could experiment on your baby and see how much they can push medicine forward. The last baby lived 3 days? Let's make the next one live 2 hours more. This is a true horror. No matter how sick is your baby termination is only possible if there are chromosomal abnormalities. And this is still only in theory. Most of the doctors are scared to do the procedure, because they don't want to be judged. My daughter (and I cannot imagine calling her 'fetus' ) had serious developmental issues that wouldn't allow her to live. But since her karyotype was ok no one was willing to help us. We were being send from doors to doors for a while until we decided to fly abroad, where we were taken care of by the most amazing medical team. 

Thank you 💖

Edit : abort!on clinic",[],,t1_edjqxql,False,0,[],False,"<div class=""md""><p>Thank you for sharing. As someone who had to TFMR illegally and traveled to a different country I really appreciate sharing the awareness. Where we live there are no abort!on clinics. At least not legal. There&#39;s nothing. You have to carry to term so that the medical staff could experiment on your baby and see how much they can push medicine forward. The last baby lived 3 days? Let&#39;s make the next one live 2 hours more. This is a true horror. No matter how sick is your baby termination is only possible if there are chromosomal abnormalities. And this is still only in theory. Most of the doctors are scared to do the procedure, because they don&#39;t want to be judged.

So by 12DPO testing is pretty definitive. 

That being said, cheapies & FRER can catch HCG pretty much immediately. I had betas coming back at 6 with obvious lines on a FRER and a smudge on wondfos. Cheapie internet tests do tend to slowly progress & frequently have ambiguity (check out r/tfablineporn and you’ll see lots of scrutiny over squinters). 

A drawback of testing early and frequently is being able to “catch” a CP that you otherwise wouldn’t have known about. If you can handle that mentally would be something to keep in mind regarding your testing strategy. I know a lot of members here choose to wait until 10dpo at a minimum to test, many rely on watching their temp trends and don’t test until their expected period is late. 

Best of luck to you!

I didn’t know it was a thing that existed until it happened to me. It’s terrifying.

I had a partial molar pregnancy. BFP in Jan 2018, found out Skyler had been gone “for some time” at 13W on April 12th and the molar tumors were flourishing. Apparently they were the cause of my constant uterine cramps. I opted for the D&C because they wanted to test the tissue to confirm, I did not want to collect it at home.

I had weekly hCG testing until it fell to negative (<5). [Here is a chart.](http://i.imgur.com/VJ6TBPc.jpg) I was told I had to wait two menstrual cycles to TTC again or until my hCG fell to negative. This is not conventional advice, I haven’t heard it anywhere else and that’s all my OBGYN said, was quite useless.

Online I found that the hCG reducing by half each week is considered good news on the no-cancer-please front. I also found that the UK’s NHS centralizes their molar and partial molar pregnancy treatment. All patients are cared for by the same doctors at Charing Cross (they don’t physically have to go unless their levels aren’t falling properly, they send in samples.) This means they have a larger dataset to look at than anyone else, publish their standards of care online, and will answer emails from doctors/patients worldwide. For partial molar they recommend following the hCG down to negative with bi-weekly tests then one last negative test 4 weeks later. Then their patients are released and cleared to TTC. I fired my doctor, got my one last negative hCG test at another, then was on my way.

You’ll see a lot about that in general, but the months of April and May are posts entirely about PMP. I got ovarian torsion from a cyst just before my negative hCG test... so after the negative there are not really any PMP info updates.

I did find info that ovarian cysts are a common complication of molar and partial molar. Wish I’d known that considering my history. For that reason and retained tissue concerns, if you do not stop bleeding in two weeks I suggest getting a follow up ultrasound to ensure all tissue is clear and everything is ok.

Sorry too see you in this sub but it is a very supportive one, we are here for you. My experience with a PM was not horrible. It was pretty straight forward. I've had recurrent MC so with my PM my OB was tracking my HCG levels. My second HCG was slightly lower than the first so they did a 6.5 week ultrasound. They found a fluid filled sac with nothing in it and a larger sort of lumpy looking structure. My OB gave me three options at the time since it was still relatively early: Let the MC occur naturally which would take up to weeks to occur and might not be 100% complete,  take misoprostel as a vaginal suppository (some order it orally) which may or may not be completely successful, or I could have a dilation and curettage (D&C) which would ensure complete removal. I opted for misoprostel since it was the cheapest and didn't require a long wait like the other two options involved.

As far as the misoprostel, the first round was not any more painful than mild cramping and spotting but no passage of tissue. 2 days later I called my OB and had a second dose of misoprostel. The 2nd dose caused a bit more cramping but the tissue passed easily enough within a few hours. Some women in here and other places report that misoprostel caused very painful cramping so the experience varies. A few days later I had a vaginal ultrasound which showed no retention of tissues and I had a follow up HCG levels done a week later. My OB said that he did not see a need to wait in TTC since I had complete passage of time before and because my HCG was zero. 

I don't know how many weeks you are but it would be a good idea to ask about your options for completing the MC. Being further along than 10 weeks they usually will recommend D&C but before that they usually recommend misoprostel (Cytotec). Some women report nausea, vomiting, headache, and mild to severe cramping. Although some cases are longer, the symptoms usually last a few hours. Taking it vaginally helps lessen the nausea and vomiting but not always. 

Something else to ask is how long they want you to wait before TTC again. With a full molar pregnancy many OBs are conservative and say ""no TTC for at least a year"" due to the risk of retained cellular material that can begin growth again once pregnancy hormones increase with conception. But, according to my OB, this is not always the case with a partial molar. If your OB does recommend the full wait, ask for a series of HCG levels and then get a second opinion.

My experience with methotrexate was not great— I had two doses of methotrexate four days apart but my levels kept going up (400’s to 2200’s before surgery), so I needed surgery to remove the tube— but they made the call to do surgery before my tube ruptured, so looking back, I was fortunate to not have had a lot of physical pain.  In the thick of it, though, my paranoia was intense, and the constant state of alertness was hard to come down from— it triggered health anxiety about other things even after my surgery was over (like when I had leg pain afterward and was freaked out it was a DVT... ended up getting scanned, no DVT).

I’m currently in the wait before trying again and am terrified of having another ectopic since the chances increase after one, but I take comfort in the fact that my doc said the next time I get a positive pregnancy test, I will come in right away for blood draws.

I just went through an ovarian ectopic in the last 2 weeks and as a result read about 100 different studies about them and methotrexate. here's what I know. First off, the methotrexate shot, when taken with hcg levels under 8,000 are almost always successful with the single injection. Given that your hcg is also just barely rising, that's an even better case for it will work. After a tubal ectopic, your biggest concern should be that the tube could possibly rupture while it dissolves. Best to avoid heavy activity and sex until you complete your miscarriage just to be super cautious. Given that you have the horrible cramping, you probably aren't far from completing the worst of it. I still had this even though my pregnancy wasn't in my tubes or uterus. No matter what you will still have uterine lining to pass as if it were a normal miscarriage.

TTC after ectopic and methotrexate. There have been recent studies that have concluded that methotrexate at the doses used for ectopic pregnancies will not impact fertility or cause birth defects. By the time you get a normal period, it will be out of your body(2-3 weeks after injection). Doctors that are still recommending waiting 3 months either haven't kept up with the research or have other reasons for this. This does not apply if you had surgical intervention, then obviously your body need time to heal. Really, your heart just needs to heal from the loss.

If you know that you have endo, definitely consider doing an hsg after your next period to check the status of your tubes. An ectopic can cause scaring in the tube that can make ttc more difficult. Knowing that ahead of time may help prevent unneeded distress if TTC takes a little longer. In general, regardless of a loss, and knowing you have endo, you might consider going to a fertility specialist, like a reproductive endocrinologist. It would probably be good for your future sanity. Heaven forbid there's anything else at play that could cause additional issues, they can at least help you determine if you should be treating your endo in any special way with what's currently going on in your body. Lots of places say to wait until you've been TTC for a year or have had 2 or more losses to go to a doctor. Ignore this.

We are at one-year of trying as of this month, but not sure given my circumstances how I should count this. Should I not be concerned yet, or should I be cueing in the help for “one year” stuff? </p>

My sac was only about 5 weeks along, and I had scans at 5.5 weeks, 7.5 weeks, and 9 weeks.  It became clear at 7.5 weeks when the sac was still empty that it was a blighted ovum.  I was told to get another scan to be absolutely sure and to see if it was passing.

I ended up trying to help it along with medication as I was flying for about 17 hours later in the week.  Thankfully the cramping passed before the trip, but most of the bleeding happened on the flight. :(

When I’m going through something like this, I tell myself that all the ugly things that need to happen (the miscarriage, the drive alone, the wait until your husband comes...) are only steps towards the future I want to build, I need to get done with them so I can do the nicer more fun things (meet again with husband, try again for a baby, etc) and eventually get there (your family is complete). This helps me get in a “get things done” mindset and avoid being paralyzed by grief. Of course I still grieve but feeling purposeful helps me grieve more constructively (if that’s a thing).

It’s normal when you’re stressed and feeling dread (dreading the miscarriage experience, not being able to be pregnant again, etc) for your brain to over rationalize and make up extra reasons for that dread, that may be why you are worried about something happening to your husband.

I don’t know your situation but I’m sure this is how the brain works, I hope knowing this helps you at least relax about this one thing!

In 2014, after undergoing IUI, I became pregnant with a son (Ethan), who was stillborn at 22 weeks due to cervical insufficiency.  My husband and I wound up needing IVF in 2016 after 2015 inexplicably delivered us three ectopic pregnancies that ultimately cost me both my tubes.  The double whammy of loss AND infertility?  It's the worst.  It's totally unfair.  It's more than anyone should have to handle.  And while it makes you want o be a parent all the more, as you've had your goal within reach only to have it taken away...it makes the prospect of moving forward utterly terrifying.    


I am beyond grateful to be able to say that in 2017 I delivered a daughter full-term after my first IVF transfer.  I had a preventative cerclage placed around 13 weeks and removed at 26 weeks, had biweekly cervical length checks from 14-24 weeks, and did P17 (hydroxyprogesterone-17, aka Makena) injections from 16-36 weeks.  Every intervention worked textbook perfectly, and my daughter is healthy, adorable, and makes me laugh every day.  Even more amazing?  A second FET was also successful this summer, and I am currently almost 23 weeks pregnant with a son.  Once again, a preventative cerclage, P17 injections, and biweekly monitoring are all doing their thing and keeping him nice and snug in here.  And to boot, the severe anxiety that I dealt with during my daughter's pregnancy (we're talking full blown panic attacks for a while during my first tri) has become all but nonexistent this time around.  I've seen this plan work once before, and I am confident that my doctors will take excellent care of me again and bring this baby to term.

I so hope you can find peace and eventually are able to release the feelings of guilt (though they are of course totally valid—it seems guilt often follows on the heels of these tragedies; at least, it did for me, and it took me a long, long time to forgive myself for a situation whose outcome I almost certainly couldn&#39;t have affected). In the meantime, I think it is hugely admirable that you are getting involved in raising awareness about CMV (you&#39;ve already educated me—I knew little to nothing about it before I read your post!), which could potentially help other families down the road. And thank you so much for your kind words.

It is awful. But please let me assure you the procedure is the easier part. I was super nervous too and it went absolutely flawlessly. We TFMR on 12/19 at 17w for significant chromosomal abnormalities and a giant omphalocele. 

I wanted to echo the posters above and share what helped me recover, physically and emotionally.

1) Take painkillers before you go in for the laminaria to be inserted. The laminaria insertion was BY FAR the most painful part of the process for me. Between the laminaria and the procedure was period-cramp-level pain. The first day was worse than the day of the procedure. 

2) Have two heating pads ready (for back and front). I used heating pads nonstop for the 24 hours between laminaria insertion and general anesthesia. They worked way better for me than Tylenol/ibuprofen. 

3) They gave me anti anxiety meds in my IV prior to the procedure, which I understand is pretty standard. Take them. I was nervous about it but I’m sooo glad I did. 

4) Consider asking the doctor to get your baby’s handprints and footprints. Even if you can’t look at them right away you will be happy you have them at some point in the future. 

5) My post-op nurse sent me home with multiple pairs of the mesh panties, which I wore for the first couple days out with large pads. They were great. I recommend asking for more than they give you. 

6) The two days after my procedure were the absolute worst emotionally. Be prepared and prepare your partner (or whoever will be there with you). I basically could not stop crying for two days. I felt like I’d cry forever. 

7) Even after I could pull it together for multiple hours at a time, I went through some absolutely insane emotional lows. I’ve been depressed before but this was a different animal. This is not to scare you, but to prepare you. It’s totally normal to feel a little bit crazy. It should pass in a few days. 

7) I went back to work 7 or 8 days after my procedure and it was too soon. It was awful. I cried in my office and it basically took all my willpower not to quit on the spot. I’m still dreading going back and just took most of this week off too. 

8) We built a little shrine in (what was supposed to be) the nursery, where I could “visit” my son whenever I wanted. I recommend this. We had a box with all the ultrasounds, baby books, and his little handprints and footprints (which our dr was kind enough to get for us). I go into “his” room at least once a day and cry, write in a grief journal, or read books on pregnancy loss. It helps me a lot to have a dedicated space to grieve. And I can lock my husband out and be alone with our son there. 

9) My therapist gave me great advice which I pass onto you. She said the people who grieve and mourn and go through all the emotions (even when it’s so uncomfortable and out of control) fare far better in the future than those who try to bottle it all up and stuff it away. They end up grieving too, because it has to come out, but much later and it ends up being harder and more confusing. I’ve tried to take this to heart and develop some rituals that help me express my grief, including journaling. I recommend you explore what works for you. 

10) I’m exactly 2 weeks out and this is the first day I feel like “myself” again. It’s still hard and it still sucks and the outside world still feels stupid and meaningless, but I don’t feel so numb today. I feel like maybe I will be a whole person again someday. 

You will get through this. 💕

<p>There are no words that can describe a situation as terrible as this. I wish you the best and I hope you can eventually find some comfort.</p>

My TFMR was an induction, so I can't speak to a D&C. I'll just speak to some other things.  

In the time before our appointment, we did some ""special"" things with the baby.  Went for a short hike in a local park we like, ""took"" baby for a nice dinner, etc.  For some people, this isn't the right approach.  But for us, it helped to make the most of the time we had left with our baby, and create some memories.  (It also helped after his death--when milestones came up, it's been nice to have those rituals to go back to, and be reminded of when he was with us.)  

One of my nurses warned me about lactation. I put a sports bra on as soon as I could, and lived in them for about 5 days. I didn't get a prescription for lactation, but my care instructions recommended peppermint or sage tea. So my husband brewed a batch for me every day (with some ginger and honey), and I drank a few cups each day.  Since you're not as far along, you might not experience it.  But you can start those things now, if you'd like--you don't have to wait until it happens post-loss & you're uncomfortable.  You can also read what worked for other people [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/ttcafterloss/comments/8oxhwc/milk_came_in_after_tfmr_just_now_freaking_out_a/).

The hospital might ask you about arrangements for your baby's remains. We picked a funeral home with information on their website about funeral/cremation for infants, stillborn babies, and miscarried babies.  (They specifically mentioned losses before 20 weeks.) We appreciated (a) that they had experience with situations like ours, and (b) that we could get most of our questions answers without talking to anyone. We gave the paperwork to a social worker at the hospital, and she did most of the communication with the funeral home. We just had to go to sign the papers. We had our baby cremated, and were allowed to have a few items (a blanket, a picture, etc.) cremated with him.

Other couples have e.g. arranged burials in their church's cemeteries--even for 1st tri losses.  You don't have to make arrangements, but some couples here have found comfort in doing so.  (And some couples have been uncomfortable with the idea of their baby's remains being disposed of by the hospital.)

Because I was induced, we got to see and hold our baby, get footprints, etc. Those momentos are precious to us now. What you can do for memory making will depend on how you feel and what the hospital offers for babies of size 14-15 weeks. (You won't be able to see the baby, but some hospitals can do footprints that early, others not). We also picked out a name for the baby. (We learned it was a boy when he was born).  

Even if you aren't sure you want to name the baby, you might want to learn the gender, if you haven't already, so you can do so later.  (Or at least ask your doctor to note it in your records, so you can ask for it if/when you're ready do.)  

A few weeks after our son died, we went to see a bereavement counselor, and I continued going on my own monthly for five or six months.  We got a referral from our hospital (for someone specialized in pregnancy/infant/child loss, and experienced with TFMR's).  Others here have found private therapists with experience in pregnancy loss.  

There's no right way to grieve this loss.  Just let yourself feel however you feel.  You and your partner may grieve in different ways and at different paces--that's okay, the important thing is to allow each other to do so, and support each other.

We had our baby cremated, and were allowed to have a few items (a blanket, a picture, etc.) cremated with him.</p>

<p>Other couples have e.g. arranged burials in their church&#39;s cemeteries--even for 1st tri losses.  You don&#39;t have to make arrangements, but some couples here have found comfort in doing so.  (And some couples have been uncomfortable with the idea of their baby&#39;s remains being disposed of by the hospital.)</p>

<p>Because I was induced, we got to see and hold our baby, get footprints, etc. Those momentos are precious to us now. What you can do for memory making will depend on how you feel and what the hospital offers for babies of size 14-15 weeks. (You won&#39;t be able to see the baby, but some hospitals can do footprints that early, others not). We also picked out a name for the baby. (We learned it was a boy when he was born).  </p>

<p>Even if you aren&#39;t sure you want to name the baby, you might want to learn the gender, if you haven&#39;t already, so you can do so later.  (Or at least ask your doctor to note it in your records, so you can ask for it if/when you&#39;re ready do.)  </p>

<p>A few weeks after our son died, we went to see a bereavement counselor, and I continued going on my own monthly for five or six months.  We got a referral from our hospital (for someone specialized in pregnancy/infant/child loss, and experienced with TFMR&#39;s).  Others here have found private therapists with experience in pregnancy loss.  </p>

<p>There&#39;s no right way to grieve this loss.  Just let yourself feel however you feel.  You and your partner may grieve in different ways and at different paces--that&#39;s okay, the important thing is to allow each other to do so, and support each other.  </p>

<p>You, your husband, and baby will be in my thoughts this week.</p>

<p>I can&#39;t believe that he&#39;d be so cluelessly mean to not break the news more gently, knowing about my recent MC. Especially because I was supposed to announce my own pregnancy at Christmas. I&#39;m mostly healed and moved on from the grief of an early MC, but made me feel kinda numb all day long. </p>

<p>Here&#39;s hoping for a successful 2019! </p>

And scar is horizontal, they did a phenomenal job, I honestly thought I&#39;d lose the whole thing so every day I&#39;m grateful for the surgeons who worked on me.  </p>

<p>Thank you, I hope the same for you as well and I hope this coming year is only wonderful for you and your partner! </p>

Second, they are both idiots bc after several miscarriages no one has still looked at your partners sperm which causes 50% of loss even though your work up may be normal.

Low progesterone is hardly the cause of anyone’s miscarriage by the way as the PROMISE trial which is the largest progesterone trial ever done with 5000!!!! Women proves that supplementation of progesterone does 0% to reduce miscarriage rates. 

Miscarriages happen due to bad eggs or bad sperm or problems with coagulation or uterine lining issues and you HAVE to send your partner / husband to do a Sperm analysis and a dna fragmentation test stat. 

You DO need labs such an RPL panel and blood testing for yourself including your FSH, LH, AFC day 3 numbers as well as a saline sono to ensure you don’t have a big ass septum preventing your babies from growing. 

Get a third opinion, they are both clueless here. Have your husband see a reproductive urologist ASAP. 

You don’t have to jump to IVF by any means and may not have to but if your husband has a Varicocele and no one checks his dna frag you will continue to miscarry and they’ll try to convince you you need donor eggs by your 3d failed IVF cycle. Get on top of this ASAP the right way. 

Sorry about all your losses, I’ve had 3 Mc followed by a termination all due to husbands sperm. 

You can look at more fun sperm facts on the sub and here r/dnafragmentation and www.dnafrag.com or pretty much all my Reddit history since miscarriages, loss and sperm is my life.
