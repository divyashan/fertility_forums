I just wanted to say that one thing that struck me as I read this post was, ""What if the roles were reversed?""  

Often after a loss, women feel their bodies have let them down.  They feel guilt.  They feel responsible.  In your case, it seems like your husband is experiencing some of these feelings (maybe in addition to you?).  Some husbands here have also written they feel conflicted about TTCing again after a loss, because of the potential pain they're setting their wives up for.  

If a husband wrote a post saying, ""wife has X medical problem that interferes with TTC.  I want to do the ""logical, easy"" thing--either A or B....but she doesn't.   That wife is upset I won't accept ""no"" for an answer.

All of that may be true, but you're dealing with this as a couple. That means that even if the balance of support favors you---some of that support has to go in his direction.

You have a healthy LC, you know you can conceive in ~4 months without intervention, IUI might make it faster.....but you're each pushing to take each other's ""easier, less stressful"" option off the table....which can make it harder for partners to be open to what the other person wants....

<p>Often after a loss, women feel their bodies have let them down.  They feel guilt.  They feel responsible.  In your case, it seems like your husband is experiencing some of these feelings (maybe in addition to you?).

We have some savings, but I looked at all the claims for the medical bills from my c-section/testing and even with insurance, it looks like we'll be paying $10k. The post-mortem genetic testing alone for my daughter was $6600. 

On top of that, I'm estranged from my mother right now due to her behavior around the death of my daughter, and that's just eating me up as well. 

I've gone off antidepressants that I've been on for years because I started getting some really awful side effects (and I'm not 100% sold that they had nothing to do with my daughter's death, even though they're supposed to be safe). So I'm currently going through SSRI withdrawal while trying to grieve and just handle my life. 

Husband (rightfully) needs me to go back to work, but I'm so unstable right now it terrifies me. We're talking about either moving and renting out our home, or getting roommates. 

That means packing up Georgia's nursery and having some stranger live in it.

I think it is too. Have you looked into RPL testing? I imagine you have, but I worry you haven't since you mentioned infertility. Your miscarriages are very atypical, and sound like my wife's. It is not normal to lose a baby at 16 weeks under any circumstance. According to the MFMs we've visited, it should be viewed as a stillbirth, because the things that cause stillbirth are the things that cause mid-pregnancy miscarriage, not the things that cause infertility. A full RPL workup is very different than infertility. I know we wasted a lot of time thinking my wife's issues stemmed from hormones, genetics, etc. In retrospect this was stupid. Our OB had suggested just trying blood thinners 'because it works in some women', and like fools we listened to the genetics counselor who told us it was genetic (we have a chromosomal abnormality). It took the loss of our totally normal baby boy at 16 weeks to figure that one out. I would push to see MFMs, not REs.

I am now 1.5 years past those thoughts and ok w all those options but each one was the next step to figuring out what the hell could be wrong and what the hell I have left as options.  Infertility is so many moving goal posts. 

Sadly.... you have actually no idea what you would do once you go through enough and you just keep wanting it. There‚Äôs a lot of things to be said about how people are worked out for infertility as well and I will say one thing that is missed by everybody is how much are males are involved in miscarriage and infertility. 
I would not do this again without making sure that your partners sperm is OK if you‚Äôre also going to have some labs and they will likely order sperm analysis but that‚Äôs not enough.

I resented people who told me I ‚Äúshouldn‚Äôt worry anymore because this pregnancy is different,‚Äù or who said ‚Äúcan‚Äôt you trust your baby?‚Äù You have to honor your emotions in order to move past them.</p>

&#x200B;

I feel like I'm going through this pregnancy with a giant mental list of things that could go wrong (which is quite lengthy because you're tested on these things in med school...), and I'm just crossing things off as we get reassurances. I'm so happy to have crossed off a few more after this ultrasound. But now I'm staring down the second half of the first trimester and my biggest fear: screening for chromosomal abnormalities. Whenever I think about it, my heart starts racing, and I have flashbacks to when we were told our daughter would never live. I haven't figured out how I'm going to cope with waiting for NIPT results or how I'm going to keep myself from unraveling in the waiting room before our NT scan. I just have to have faith that the anticipation of these things is almost always worse than the thing itself, and that I'll be able to keep my shit together when the time comes. In the meantime, I'll be falling back on my favorite mantra: ""HARDEN THE F#$% UP, AEB."" (I like self-compassion and all that, too, but telling myself to be strong--and reminding myself that I AM strong--is usually what keeps me from crumbling.)

&#x200B;

I think of you all often, and I lurk on the sub to see how you're doing. In many ways, I still feel like I belong here more than I do over at PAL. My heart goes out to all of you with fresh losses...the three months after my loss were by far the hardest in my life. But you're all strong enough to get through it. And it gets better.

&#x200B;

\*Our daughter's condition (Trisomy 18) doesn't make this pregnancy high risk. But when I called to make an appointment with my OB, I explained to the admin that we had a loss earlier this year, that I understand the nature of the loss doesn't warrant additional monitoring, but that I would just really, really appreciate an earlier appointment or an earlier scan because I'm nervous. She didn't push back at all and put me in for a 7-week ultrasound. I'm so glad she did that for me, and I highly recommend asking for that in your next pregnancy (if you think it would be helpful to you).",[],,t1_e5ylv38,False,0,[],False,"<div class=""md""><p>Had our first ultrasound yesterday*, and the baby is doing great so far--thank god.

My husband and I are so relieved, and we&#39;re trying hard to focus on cautious optimism instead of the voice in the back of our heads saying, &quot;Yeah, but our daughter had a beautiful 8-week ultrasound, too...&quot; </p>

<p>&#x200B;</p>

<p>I feel like I&#39;m going through this pregnancy with a giant mental list of things that could go wrong (which is quite lengthy because you&#39;re tested on these things in med school...), and I&#39;m just crossing things off as we get reassurances. I&#39;m so happy to have crossed off a few more after this ultrasound. But now I&#39;m staring down the second half of the first trimester and my biggest fear: screening for chromosomal abnormalities. Whenever I think about it, my heart starts racing, and I have flashbacks to when we were told our daughter would never live. I haven&#39;t figured out how I&#39;m going to cope with waiting for NIPT results or how I&#39;m going to keep myself from unraveling in the waiting room before our NT scan. I just have to have faith that the anticipation of these things is almost always worse than the thing itself, and that I&#39;ll be able to keep my shit together when the time comes. In the meantime, I&#39;ll be falling back on my favorite mantra: &quot;HARDEN THE F#$% UP, AEB.&quot; (I like self-compassion and all that, too, but telling myself to be strong--and reminding myself that I AM strong--is usually what keeps me from crumbling.)</p>

<p>&#x200B;</p>

<p>I think of you all often, and I lurk on the sub to see how you&#39;re doing. In many ways, I still feel like I belong here more than I do over at PAL. My heart goes out to all of you with fresh losses...the three months after my loss were by far the hardest in my life. But you&#39;re all strong enough to get through it. And it gets better.</p>

<p>&#x200B;</p>

<p>*Our daughter&#39;s condition (Trisomy 18) doesn&#39;t make this pregnancy high risk. But when I called to make an appointment with my OB, I explained to the admin that we had a loss earlier this year, that I understand the nature of the loss doesn&#39;t warrant additional monitoring, but that I would just really, really appreciate an earlier appointment or an earlier scan because I&#39;m nervous. She didn&#39;t push back at all and put me in for a 7-week ultrasound. I&#39;m so glad she did that for me, and I highly recommend asking for that in your next pregnancy (if you think it would be helpful to you).</p>

She too was perfectly healthy and died during labor, she was revived but then we had to take her off of life support.

Sometimes I look back at the early weeks, the first three months or so, and I don't know how I survived it. The grief was SO heavy all the time. I also struggled knowing I would grieve forever, miss her forever. As time has passed my grief has changed. I have happy times, there is light in my life, but I still cry everyday, somedays are harder than others. The memories will come up and pull me under for a bit, but I find that I'm better at going with the flow which means they seem to pass unhindered.

The time I spend flattened out, just bowled over by it all, are less often then they once were. 

This must be the new normal people talk about. I miss her, but I don't feel that acute empty arms ache that I had. I'm sad to say that I'm used to her being gone. She feels like a beautiful and tragic dream sometimes. Hard to explain how she can feel unreal and TOO real at the same time. 

Life is very bittersweet now, probably will be forever. 

My relationship has struggled, but I have faith that we will weather this storm, how could we not? We are the two people who loved her the most, we held her as she took her last breaths....We may grieve differently, but I'm ok with that now. He is able to be strong for me, he feels a sense of purpose being able to support me.  You won't be a burden. You're in the very early days, the time crawls, you don't want the time to pass, but you need it. 

The heavy grief will ease, as will the guilt, life will trudge on forward whether you want it to or not. It's a bitter pill to swallow, but I promise you not too long from now things will be a bit easier. Bit by bit.

",[],,t1_e5xpw8n,False,0,[],False,"<div class=""md""><p>I just passed the six month mark of my my youngest daughters birth and death.  She too was perfectly healthy and died during labor, she was revived but then we had to take her off of life support.</p>

<p>Sometimes I look back at the early weeks, the first three months or so, and I don&#39;t know how I survived it. The grief was SO heavy all the time. I also struggled knowing I would grieve forever, miss her forever. As time has passed my grief has changed. I have happy times, there is light in my life, but I still cry everyday, somedays are harder than others. The memories will come up and pull me under for a bit, but I find that I&#39;m better at going with the flow which means they seem to pass unhindered.</p>

<p>The time I spend flattened out, just bowled over by it all, are less often then they once were. </p>

<p>This must be the new normal people talk about. I miss her, but I don&#39;t feel that acute empty arms ache that I had. I&#39;m sad to say that I&#39;m used to her being gone. She feels like a beautiful and tragic dream sometimes. Hard to explain how she can feel unreal and TOO real at the same time. </p>

<p>Life is very bittersweet now, probably will be forever. </p>

<p>My relationship has struggled, but I have faith that we will weather this storm, how could we not? We are the two people who loved her the most, we held her as she took her last breaths....We may grieve differently, but I&#39;m ok with that now. He is able to be strong for me, he feels a sense of purpose being able to support me.  You won&#39;t be a burden. You&#39;re in the very early days, the time crawls, you don&#39;t want the time to pass, but you need it. </p>

<p>The heavy grief will ease, as will the guilt, life will trudge on forward whether you want it to or not. It&#39;s a bitter pill to swallow, but I promise you not too long from now things will be a bit easier. Bit by bit.</p>

The first loss is so traumatic because at that time we know NOTHING about how babies are made OR what causes them to make it. Let me start off by saying that after several years of this and several mc you find out a LOT. There are issues with sperm and eggs that can be genetic, due to our dietary choices, the SPERM can have DNA fragmentation and damage, the eggs can have karyotype issues, our diets can change and affect how our hormones function. I literally think people are so lucky NOT to find out how babies are truly made. With that being said, I have VERY LITTLE belief that what you do during the pregnancy besides the obvious don't drink and do drugs has affect on earlty 1st trimester miscarriages. Early losses have to do with embryo development that is all pretty much coded in the DNA we are passing down and the health of the egg AND the sperm during conception. If you want to read about sperm there is a great sub about it on the infertility sub and DNA fragmentation issues with sperm. There are also some reasons such as blood clotting disorders and host of other labs they can check for you albeit most of the time this is premature after 1 loss. After 1 loss it's very safe to try again and 90% of the time you will get pregnant and have a normal baby. There is NO reason to believe that won't happen after just 1 loss, but it SUCKS to experience it. Now where it gets complicated and work up should be done is after 2 losses. For now, your chances of having a miscarriage are actually identical to someone who has never had a miscarriage. It only increases after one has had two. I would not have done anything differently had I known all I know now and I would proceed with TTC. I was the rare 1% with multiple losses, but that's just that. This is VERY rare. I have many friends who have had a miscariage and now hold a baby.  I hope you are part of the 90%. This is very common, BUT IT DOES NOT HURT LESS KNOWING THAT. It's fucked up and you will always feel fucked up and scared and want more answers. Hopefully you don't need to do more work up because this wont happen again.

I‚Äôm sure it will be worse once I get closer to the due date. I hope it mostly goes away after that. The milestones and special events that I was so looking forward to are hard to think about. I think it will ultimately be time that helps to ease those invasive thoughts out. Hang in there üíï </p>

I don&#39;t know why life is so unfair and I am having such a hard time moving forward without children I thought I would always have. I am really sorry for your loss &amp; that pain is excruciating </p>

-D&C @ 8 weeks 7/26 after seeing HB. Requested genetic testing because it was our 2nd loss in a row and our second pregnancy. They said it wasn‚Äôt needed but my insurance covered it
-doctors said wait one cycle and try again.

-neg preg test Aug 12.

-we started this cycle with enthusiasm. We decided to BD EOD. We did do exactly that, until 0-2/0-3.... because we were called and the results of the POC test showed Triploidy and possible partial molar. The tissue will be sent back to path to confirm partial molar. Blood drawn yesterday and HCG was 0. 

I told the docs I was in the danger zone and I had just BD and ovulation was imminent. They said if you did get preg it wouldn‚Äôt be the worst thing and it‚Äôs a really, really good sign that you had hcg 0 blood tests confirmed and neg HPT after the D&C. 

The thing that trips me up is that if I didn‚Äôt ask for POC genetic testing, we would be blindly going for it this month without knowing the risk of the partial molar. Hoping everything comes back fine.

I wish doctors would base their advice purely from a physical standpoint because it makes it hard to tell what advice is necessary to listen to. 

I went in for a UTI one cycle when I was TTC, and when I mentioned that and asked if he could make sure I got an antibiotic that was safe for pregnancy, he was like ""youre not pregnant"". 


""No, I'm not pregnant.""

""Oh, youve tested yourself? Thats great!""


Then i just stared at him for a second until I realized he was telling me, and not asking. They must have tested my urine. Of course I fucking know I'm not pregnant, but not because I tested because of the UTI, because I'm TTC and pee on a stick a day, at least. Ugh.

He went on to tell me that the antibiotic would probably mess my cycles all up for a while (ovulated 7 days later, on a totally normal cd17...) and so I should just take the next few cycles off. 

Not because there was any reason to not get pregnant while on antibiotics or while being treated for a UTI....just because my cycles might be a bit weird. 

I think doctors get disconnected from how much this matters to us. For them its easy to say something like ""wait a year"" because maybe that's the most conservative time estimate they can come up with, they know you should be better by then, but they're not thinking about the year of your life that's gone.

But you're right, the later the loss (and the more medical intervention involved ie. D&E etc.) the more sense it makes to give your body time to heal. Outcomes can just be so different from woman to woman its hard to know what you will need physically. Some women still wont have their cycles under control after a year, some will ovulate a few weeks after their loss, get pregnant,  and carry to term no problem.

I know. I know I shouldn‚Äôt blame my body. 
But after my first loss in December, I was confident that that was just a bad egg and odds were it wouldn‚Äôt happen again. But it did.

I had a d&c today. 

I‚Äôve had 3 healthy pregnancies with no losses in between. I considered myself extremely lucky. A baby at 19, one at 24, and my last-born at 34. 

I never had trouble conceiving any of them. One shot and boom - I was pregnant. 

After the first loss, the doctor encouraged me to try again, which we did. 

For the first time, it took us months of trying to conceive this one. A sign my body is aging?  Maybe. 

Considering my past of healthy pregnancies, the doctor believed the first loss just had to do with a luck of the draw - just a bad egg out of a batch of good ones.  She was confident that the odds of it happening again were slim. 

And now that it has happened again in succession, she believes age may be a factor. 

This is the most devastating news. 

You can treat clotting disorders or other fertility issues to go on and have babies successfully. But you can‚Äôt reverse age. 

I wanted at least one more. Maybe two. I‚Äôm 36 years old. I thought my ovaries still had some life in it. But now it‚Äôs a game of Russian roulette. How will we know when I‚Äôm ovulating with a good egg? I can‚Äôt keep having miscarriages until one sticks. It‚Äôs emotionally painful and I‚Äôm running out of time.

I think you should give antidepressants a try. I highly recommend it. They will help you cope. And if you get to a point where you think things are going well for you in the future, then you're free to wean off of them and see how things go. If you get back to a place where you're feeling not like you again, you can always go back on them if you need to. That's the great thing about them is trying them can't hurt and you can always get off of them if you need to. 
But the benefits of them can make a huge difference for you. I have been taking mine regularly and feel like it's helped me stay above water in my despair.. 
Obviously, they aren't a cure all. There's still work you have to put in on your end BUT they help you get to a place of mind where you can handle things just a bit more and can have the strength to work through thoughts and feelings rather than drowning in them. 

And don't stress about weight loss. I say just start by going outside. Then work your way up to taking walks. Go to the parks. Look at life around you, feel the sun and breathe the air. You'll work your way back to being physically active. Right now you need to let your mind, heart and body heal.

My temps are effed so far this cycle!

They are double checking with the lab to see if they can get a positive on the partial molar or not. I think right now it is suspected partial molar. At any rate, we may be benched for 6 months.

<p>I am terrified that my body will once again fail us - me, my husband, another of our children.  But the love and the desire for a child has finally edged itself above the fear.  I don&#39;t really think I will ever feel ready - not the way I was excited and ready about it before our loss. But I am as ready as I will be</p>

Hi, I‚Äôm new. My wife and I (same-sex couple) have been TTC for over 2 years. After years of home insemination and IUIs we did our first IVF cycle in June and found out in early July that we lost our first and only pregnancy. It was a fairly early loss but impacted us so deeply. Thankfully we have frozen embryos so we can try again although it‚Äôs been harder than I could have imagined to get back in the TTC mindset.

It took 4 cycles (tracking temp, OPKs) after that to get pregnant again. I got the positive test a couple weeks before my first son&#39;s due date. </p>

First. You will find a new normal eventually. It‚Äôs not going to be the same. And randomly the pain comes back full force along with the self doubt and depression. That is normal. Grief is not a sprint. It‚Äôs a marathon. Everyone needs their own time, pace and distraction to heal.

I‚Äôm pretty sure he‚Äôs been told growing up to ‚Äúsuck it up and man up‚Äù. Don‚Äôt show feelings. That makes is so hard for us to see how much they‚Äôre actually hurting, especially when we‚Äôre caught in our own grief. 

After our loss I was barely functional. I couldn‚Äôt see my husbands pain. I couldn‚Äôt see how he suffered because he didn‚Äôt have friends here (Military). I couldn‚Äôt see how depressed he got. Until the day his command showed up because he had been talking about how no one would care if he killed himself. 3 Months after we lost our daughter I learned I was about to loose my husband. He voluntarily got himself committed. And went to therapy. He‚Äôs doing great now, but I‚Äôll never forget that night. 

I wish we had had friends he could have talked to. 

Please be kind to yourself and your husband. I know you probably long for a child. But give him some space to heal too. Maybe sit down together and try to have a real convert about it.

After the first loss (MMC, 9-10 weeks), we thought it sounded sensible to take a few months off to heal emotionally. However, when we tried to put that into practice it wasn't ""healing"" at all. We spent about 3 weeks bickering constantly and then gave up right before ovulation :P Thankfully we didn't have any medical reasons to wait, so we just went with it. It felt so much more natural to try again. After this first loss, we had 3 losses at 4-5 weeks (conceived in a span of 4 months) and then two losses at 7-8 weeks (conceived in 2-3 months). We didn't take off any time between these. After our third loss, we started to look into hormonal issues, take progesterone, etc.

After our sixth loss, we learned that I had a chromosomal abnormality (balanced inversion) and we were told that it increased our risk of early losses, but if we kept trying we would likely have a healthy baby eventually. We were told there was no increased risk of later loss or of a surviving child with chromosomal issues. We were devastated to learn that we should expect many losses, but we were also happy to finally have an answer other than ""bad luck."" We decided to stay open to the possibility of pregnancy (ie. have sex, no effort to avoid pregnancy), but also to pursue adoption. Starting the adoption process was very exciting! A few months into the process, we conceived again. We expected to miscarry early on, but at 12 weeks baby was looking great. We were told that there was no increased risk at this point and we should expect to have a healthy baby. Unfortunately, we lost our seventh baby very suddenly at 16 weeks. Testing showed that we'd lost a chromosomally normal baby boy. With this new information, several geneticists and MFMs decided that my chromosomal abnormality was *not* the problem after all and probably wasn't a cause of any losses. Aaargh! I can't express how frustrating that was. The new theory was blood clotting. Despite dozens of clotting tests I've never gotten a firm diagnosis, but two of the MFMs we saw were convinced it was the issue based on our history.

After our seventh loss, we didn't wait to try again. We considered it but I felt desperate to be pregnant again. It took us 6 cycles/7 months to conceive again, which is the longest it's ever taken us. At the time I felt really hopeless about ever conceiving again - I thought maybe the D&E I had after our son died had left lasting damage. Looking back, it seems more likely that my body needed more time to recover because the loss was later. I started blood thinners as soon as I got a positive test. So far it seems to be working. We've reached the 22 week mark with a healthy baby and the placenta looks good. We're hoping this is the answer for us and we get to take this baby home.

Overall reflections - I'm glad we didn't wait to try again. Obviously it's a very personal decision, but I don't think waiting would have made what we went through any easier emotionally. I'm also glad that we didn't wait on any testing since there were so many wrong theories.

",[],,t1_e5kkxk7,False,0,[],False,"<div class=""md""><p>My husband and I have had a lot of losses. After the first loss (MMC, 9-10 weeks), we thought it sounded sensible to take a few months off to heal emotionally. However, when we tried to put that into practice it wasn&#39;t &quot;healing&quot; at all. We spent about 3 weeks bickering constantly and then gave up right before ovulation :P Thankfully we didn&#39;t have any medical reasons to wait, so we just went with it. It felt so much more natural to try again. After this first loss, we had 3 losses at 4-5 weeks (conceived in a span of 4 months) and then two losses at 7-8 weeks (conceived in 2-3 months). We didn&#39;t take off any time between these. After our third loss, we started to look into hormonal issues, take progesterone, etc.</p>

<p>After our sixth loss, we learned that I had a chromosomal abnormality (balanced inversion) and we were told that it increased our risk of early losses, but if we kept trying we would likely have a healthy baby eventually. We were told there was no increased risk of later loss or of a surviving child with chromosomal issues. We were devastated to learn that we should expect many losses, but we were also happy to finally have an answer other than &quot;bad luck.&quot; We decided to stay open to the possibility of pregnancy (ie. have sex, no effort to avoid pregnancy), but also to pursue adoption. Starting the adoption process was very exciting! A few months into the process, we conceived again. We expected to miscarry early on, but at 12 weeks baby was looking great. We were told that there was no increased risk at this point and we should expect to have a healthy baby. Unfortunately, we lost our seventh baby very suddenly at 16 weeks. Testing showed that we&#39;d lost a chromosomally normal baby boy. With this new information, several geneticists and MFMs decided that my chromosomal abnormality was <em>not</em> the problem after all and probably wasn&#39;t a cause of any losses. Aaargh! I can&#39;t express how frustrating that was. The new theory was blood clotting. Despite dozens of clotting tests I&#39;ve never gotten a firm diagnosis, but two of the MFMs we saw were convinced it was the issue based on our history.</p>

<p>After our seventh loss, we didn&#39;t wait to try again. We considered it but I felt desperate to be pregnant again. It took us 6 cycles/7 months to conceive again, which is the longest it&#39;s ever taken us. At the time I felt really hopeless about ever conceiving again - I thought maybe the D&amp;E I had after our son died had left lasting damage. Looking back, it seems more likely that my body needed more time to recover because the loss was later. I started blood thinners as soon as I got a positive test. So far it seems to be working.

The ""normal"" level is 9-47ng/ml in the first trimester. So, 10 is in that, but yes its very low. That is such a huge range, like so many things with fertility/pregnancy.

The role of progesterone issues is highly questioned, and regularly studied. The overall conclusion is that low progesterone is not the cause of a loss, but likely a symptom.

Progesterone supplements (most often) can't hurt. But outside of IVF, there is no concrete evidence that progesterone replacement is helpful. Also, most specialists believe that IF supplementation helps, it needs to be started at 3DPO to possibly have an impact. 

Many doctors believe they actually need to boost your ovulation, which naturally causes higher progesterone. This is often the reason for fertility medications like Femara and Clomid. CD21 tests (7DPO test, actually) can show what your non-pregnant progesterone is, but it has to be tested numerous cycles to have any information. And its still not a fully conclusive reason for infertility or loss.

If you want to try progesterone supplementation, I suggest doing it at 3DPO...then you would wait until 12-13 DPO and take a test. If its negative, you can stop and you should have your period in a couple days.

Also, having a LC does NOT mean you would not have a progesterone issue now. Hormones change. Bodies change. Especially after pregnancy/childbirth. So it is still worth checking into.

I had the procedure at 12+1 in April; I would have been 33 weeks today. I didn't get a bump (..any more so than what already existed there) or kicks. All of these things make your pain so much deeper. I'm so sorry. 

I'm also quite terrified of never getting pregnant again. I don't really have a reason to be, but that kind of doesn't matter anymore - I didn't have a reason to be concerned about a random genetic fluke, but it happened anyway. The good news is that my cycles have gone completely regular - I'm talking textbook - which they weren't even that way before I got pregnant. I have hope again, but the hope is scary because lots of hope can also bring lots of disappointment.

I don't know how I feel about another loss. Obviously no one wants to ever go through one, but I don't know if I'm as concerned about it as I was when originally trying (this was my first pregnancy/first loss). I was *terrified* of a miscarriage. And then it never happened so I thought I was fine. I didn't ever imagine that we'd need to TFMR. I'm kind of like ... ""I've gone through my worst case scenario, could it be worse than this?"" (and of course the answer is yes, based on the people here who have had stillborn children at full gestation) but I think my terror will just be in more manageable chunks. I've seen people over at PAL that have said you've just got to get through the stages. First it's worrying if it's chemical. Next is miscarriage. After that is chromosomes.

I had the procedure at 12+1 in April; I would have been 33 weeks today. I didn&#39;t get a bump (..any more so than what already existed there) or kicks. All of these things make your pain so much deeper. I&#39;m so sorry. </p>

<p>I&#39;m also quite terrified of never getting pregnant again. I don&#39;t really have a reason to be, but that kind of doesn&#39;t matter anymore - I didn&#39;t have a reason to be concerned about a random genetic fluke, but it happened anyway. The good news is that my cycles have gone completely regular - I&#39;m talking textbook - which they weren&#39;t even that way before I got pregnant. I have hope again, but the hope is scary because lots of hope can also bring lots of disappointment.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t know how I feel about another loss. Obviously no one wants to ever go through one, but I don&#39;t know if I&#39;m as concerned about it as I was when originally trying (this was my first pregnancy/first loss). I was <em>terrified</em> of a miscarriage. And then it never happened so I thought I was fine. I didn&#39;t ever imagine that we&#39;d need to TFMR. I&#39;m kind of like ... &quot;I&#39;ve gone through my worst case scenario, could it be worse than this?&quot; (and of course the answer is yes, based on the people here who have had stillborn children at full gestation) but I think my terror will just be in more manageable chunks. I&#39;ve seen people over at PAL that have said you&#39;ve just got to get through the stages. First it&#39;s worrying if it&#39;s chemical. Next is miscarriage. After that is chromosomes. After that, it&#39;s making it to viability. And so on and so forth... </p>

People literally do not know what to do or say in response to things like this, so it helped me keep my cool when they started spouting nonsense. 

We didn't tell many people that we terminated. It's such a difficult beast. Not only do you have to contend with losing a child, but you also have to deal with facing judgment over it!

A weeding out of sorts - if they couldn't see the reason why we'd done this and insisted that carrying to term would have been better overall for everyone, I would not have wanted to continue that relationship.

"" As for grief, you'll find it comes in waves. In the beginning, the waves are 100 feet tall and crash over you without mercy. They come 10 seconds apart and don't even give you time to catch your breath. All you can do is hang on and float. After a while, maybe weeks, maybe months, you'll find the waves are still 100 feet tall, but they come further apart. When they come, they still crash all over you and wipe you out. But in between, you can breathe, you can function. You never know what's going to trigger the grief. It might be a song, a picture, a street intersection, the smell of a cup of coffee. It can be just about anything...and the wave comes crashing. But in between waves, there is life.

Somewhere down the line, and it's different for everybody, you find that the waves are only 80 feet tall. Or 50 feet tall. And while they still come, they come further apart. You can see them coming. An anniversary, a birthday, or Christmas, or landing at O'Hare. You can see it coming, for the most part, and prepare yourself. And when it washes over you, you know that somehow you will, again, come out the other side. Soaking wet, sputtering, still hanging on to some tiny piece of the wreckage, but you'll come out.

Take it from an old guy. The waves never stop coming, and somehow you don't really want them to. But you learn that you'll survive them. And other waves will come. And you'll survive them too. If you're lucky, you'll have lots of scars from lots of loves. And lots of shipwrecks.""

Take Letrozole cycle days 3 - 7 for stronger ovulation.

Even though I assumed this drug isn't necessary if you are ovulating, apparently it does more than bringing on an ovulation and increases the chances of carrying to term.

He told me to start taking a baby aspirin (81 mg) daily just in case the tiny blood vessels to the uterus are clotting. It doesn't hurt me to take the aspirin and it could be preventing something. Might as well.

Next, he said as soon as I get a positive hpt to call him and he's going to do blood tests as well as prescribe me progesterone suppositories. This is another precaution like the aspirin. I may not need it, but it doesn't hurt so might as well. But in regards to this question specifically, he said to start taking the progesterone upon a positive hpt. 

I ""might"" have PCOS because I have acne and irregular cycles, but all my blood work and tests are normal. I have been taking metformin and my cycles have never been more regular. He said to remain on metformin throughout pregnancy as it may help prevent a miscarriage.

I hope this info helps...

<p>In other news, i told a friend yesterday about my losses. She was recently diagnosed with fibromyalgia. Absolutely shocking. She is the most energetic person I know, started a business, just radiates energy and initiative. She is stunning and so fit. I am shocked. While we both couldn‚Äôt quite understand fully what each other is going through, we both feel ‚Äúlet down‚Äù by our bodies at 30. I‚Äôm going to send her a card in the mail :) </p>

<p>I‚Äôm so glad therapy has helped you. I‚Äôve been in therapy for about 6 years now and I can say I am a much better person for it. Wishing you peace and comfort on your journey. ‚ù§Ô∏è </p>

It looks like OH has a 20 week/22 week gestation ban on terminations. After this time, it becomes illegal and you would have to go to a different state in order to have the procedure done. Generally, anatomy scans are done around weeks 18-20 I believe so if there were to be something very wrong, it's an extremely quick turnaround to make a decision.

After loss 3 I did 2 cycles with fertility meds -- Femara once and Clomid once.  

I did this because my CD21 results were always low, many many cycles in a row. AND I tend to naturally ovulate on CD12ish, which is considered a tad early. There are not really any studies that show ""early"" ovulation to be a proven issue, but its a belief that the egg could need more time to mature. Hard to say if that was my true issue, but both meds did lengthen my follicular phase and increase my CD21 results.

With Femara I didn't have multiple mature eggs, so they weren't concerned about multiples. With Clomid I did have 2-3 that were maturing at the same rate and I was given the warning that it could happen. But I knew that going in -- each medicine has statistics on multiples. The rate of twins is obviously higher than the rate for triplets+.  

Many people I know who used fertility meds had their cycles ""canceled"" due to the concern of multiples. This either happened because they had many more mature eggs OR because they had multiple mature eggs AND were doing something else, like trigger shots or IUI. Especially IUI, as multiple eggs and IUI combined has a higher rate of multiples. 

So, with fertility meds I always just suggest as much monitoring as possible. Many docs hand it out and don't follow your cycle at all. That works for a lot of people, but if you CAN, I suggest monitoring.  They can do ultrasounds to see if you're close to ovulation and how many eggs are maturing, giving a better idea of your chance of multiples.

I actually did conceive on both cycles...one was a CP and one was an ectopic. But its unlikely the meds caused the issues (especially after 3 prior losses)

And that may not even be true. The fear and pain is strong. But, its so easy to push your own boundaries. To go further than you ever thought you would. To set a limit, reach it, then just be like ""well, lets try this one other thing...""

Would another loss make you stop trying for good? Maybe! It's one of those ""can't know until you're there"" scenarios.

I just went through TFMR last month at 20 weeks, it‚Äôs not even been two weeks since my loss.

Losing our son has made my husband and I realize we want a family more than anything, so even though I DO have those fears about what could happen, I am not deterred.

As for a counselor, I do not need one. Not in the sense that I dont think i do, it's that i plain jane do not need one.

Hospitals and sickness are a big trigger for my son, he had to go in for some minor surgery last month and it seemed to bring up a lot of stuff for him, and when I'm sick (even just a cold) he gets anxious.  Looking back, I don't know if we should have talked so much about how the baby and I were sick - some wires have crossed there that might need to be uncrossed later.

In the early days I would tell my son that I was sad about Rhys and I would cry in front of him, now 7 months on we try and talk to him in happier terms about it - we both have tattoos commemorating him and a plant in our backyard to remember him, so we talk about those things and how nice it is to remember.  Hospitals and sickness are a big trigger for my son, he had to go in for some minor surgery last month and it seemed to bring up a lot of stuff for him, and when I&#39;m sick (even just a cold) he gets anxious.  Looking back, I don&#39;t know if we should have talked so much about how the baby and I were sick - some wires have crossed there that might need to be uncrossed later.  </p>

<p>I hope that helps. I&#39;m so so sorry about the loss of your baby, I hope you are taking care of yourself and giving yourself time to grieve.  Xx</p>

<p>But I definitely felt the urge to do it right after delivery, I think it was very hormone driven and I felt desperate to be pregnant again, especially with my milk coming in and everything. It does wear off after a little while. I‚Äôm still keen to get the green light to TTC again, but the desperate urgency is gone which feels better, because I feel like I can go into it with a clear head now.</p>

<p>I‚Äôm very sorry for your loss, and that you‚Äôve had to join our little community. It‚Äôs a very safe place here ‚ù§Ô∏è</p>

YES, the ANGER! My odds were 1/946 before NIPT. Why did I have to be the 1? Why didn't my body realize my baby wasn't healthy and do the merciful thing for me? Why did I get lucky and conceive first try, only to have my baby taken from me? Why do others get to have healthy, blissful pregnancies and be blindly hopeful and excited and I don't?

We were devastated but wanted another baby more than anything. At my follow-up post d&amp;c my ob said we could start trying even before I got my period back. So that‚Äôs what we did. It took a few months but we got pregnant again, this time it was a blighted ovum. Again we started trying immediately and again got pregnant a few months later. Unfortunately this third pregnancy also ended in a miscarriage and now I‚Äôm waiting for my period to come back. This time my husband is so sure he wants to try again right away but I‚Äôm not so sure. I‚Äôm just not sure if my heart can handle this again right now.</p>

I don't have much to add to all of the wonderful advice you've already gotten from u/beany_babies and others. It seems like you've already decided to go forward with the CVS, which I wholeheartedly agree with. As others have mentioned, this test will give you 100% certainty and will also tell you whether or not this is likely to happen again in the future (heritable Trisomy 18 is very rare, but it's possible). If you'd like to talk more about balanced translocations or the difference between screening tests (NIPT/ultrasound) and diagnostic tests (CVS/amniocentesis), please feel free to DM me. Unfortunately, this is something I (and many others here) have thought a lot about over the past several months.

In terms of how to be 100% certain about going forward with ending the pregnancy...To be honest, my husband and I were 100% certain the moment we got the diagnosis. We didn't even have to have a discussion about it. But we have the benefit of both being in medicine. We learned about Trisomy 18 in med school, and my husband even took care of a child with Trisomy 18 while on his pediatrics rotation. I won't go into details here about what that child's life was like--it's too upsetting. But if you feel it would help you feel more confident in the decision to terminate, I would be happy to share with you over DM. The bottom line is that I would never want my child to live like that. I wouldn't wish that life on my worst enemy. And sure, if you google Trisomy 18, there are some people out their who say, ""I have a 10-year-old kid with Trisomy 18, and she's my life's joy!"" That is a *vanishingly* small number of children, and most (all?) of them don't have a complete Trisomy 18 (they likely have mosaic, where not all of their cells are affected by the abnormality).

&#x200B;

The decision you're facing right now is one that no parent should ever have to make. But in my view, it was our responsibility as parents to protect our child from the suffering we knew she would face if she was ever born into this world. We made a difficult decision, and we've suffered. But I'm glad we were the ones in pain, not her.

<p>Please feel free to reach out over DM. Obviously, all losses are difficult, but TFMR is a unique type of hell...I can&#39;t emphasize enough how helpful it&#39;s been for me to be able to talk to other TFMR moms here.

That's a really wonderful name. You were far enough along that it totally makes sense to name him. Something about only carrying him for 13/14 weeks makes me feel weird, but I know there's no wrong way to deal with this in that respect-- name or not. They told me mine was a boy during the NIPT, so I've know for a bit more than a week now. It's dumb, but even with the diagnosis I'd really pictured the future with this little boy and imagined my daughter with him. There seemed to be so much hope. Everyone was optimistic. 

The kicks, the very very few dull flutters I have felt, have made me sad. I guess your view is a good one and I should try to take some peace in the time I have left with him. But I find myself feeling so bitter that he's still here. I feel horrible but I almost want to find blood when I wipe. 

The genetic counselor I saw, as well as the MFM specialist said that the PPV directly correlates with age because it considers your odds, at your age, of having a child with the defect. That's a part of your risk factor which is used for the calculation. But I guess it doesn't matter because it doesn't change anything. It's a rare condition and less common in my age group and I'm angry. Anyway, I hope I can see him once more as well. I'm not sure how to ask without sounding silly, or who to ask really. I'll see the MFM specialist once more and then I'll be in the hospital for the procedure, so hopefully one of them will let me see and maybe get one good picture. 

One of my biggest sources of conflict comes from the fact that he looked normal. I hope the specialist will allow me an ultrasound and give a thorough look because I'd feel so much better if something was blatantly wrong. But, I know that if nothing is there, I'll just be more upset. 

I really hope you end up with the family you've always imagined. I'm sure you'll raise some really amazing little ones. 

Therapy sounds like the right idea, for me as well. Especially as we've decided to try again as soon as it's medically acceptable and I know I'll have huge anxiety levels to manage at that point. 

It really feels like my SO is over it. I know he's not. He's sad and he expresses it, but it's hard for me to remember that he isn't experiencing a pregnancy. He isn't seeing the pain in big pregnant bellies. This wasn't really a baby for him yet. He was an idea, and it hurts to lose an idea but it's a different sort of pain.

I didn‚Äôt, despite seeing my babies not have full a full brain and not have faces, I still questioned myself when the time came. They had heart beats and they were mine to care for, it‚Äôs not an easy thing to comprehend. Just know if it is Trisomy 18, the life your baby would have outside of the womb would not be a life you would want for anyone. You would be doing the most compassionate thing, an act of love, for your baby if you chose to terminate. I‚Äôm so sorry, my heart breaks for you. I send you wishes of peace and love to get through this awful experience. We are here for you. </p>

I‚Äôll give you the short of it but if you want the long version, feel free to check my post history.

At 11 weeks, I did the NIPT (Panorama). At 13 weeks, I got the results back - 9/10 chance for T21, PPV (chance of true positive) of 91%. I was too far along for a CVS, but it wouldn‚Äôt have mattered anyway because the only way my baby wasn‚Äôt affected was if the abnormality was only present in the placenta.

My ultrasound at the MFM office showed a couple markers for T21. I had three amnios, the first two of which failed at 15+4 and 16+4 because of tenting membranes. We finally had success at 18+2, got prelim results at 18+4, and final results at 19+4. We terminated at 19+5. I went through 6 weeks of pure hell to get the answer I needed. I knew based on the odds what my baby‚Äôs fate would likely be, but I had to know 100% for sure. My pain would be so much greater if I‚Äôd had to carry that doubt with me my whole life.

At the time, I hated waiting and it ate me up, but on the other hand I was glad to have gotten to bond more with my sweet baby boy and got to feel him kick and watch him grow in my belly. I have a feeling my pain would still be awful had I been able to terminate earlier, but so much of my pain is missing my belly and his kicks, so I‚Äôm sure I would be feeling at least a little better had I not had to wait so long.

Anyway, my advice is to get the extra testing to be 100% sure. That doubt would have eaten me alive, and I would never advise someone else to take that chance. The only way I would have gone through with TFMR without that 100% was if I got too close to the deadline to terminate in my state or the neighboring state which is 2 weeks later than my home state. I knew termination was the right thing because I didn‚Äôt know how much my baby would suffer. The lives of babies with Downs can vary so widely in terms of quality and length, and I couldn‚Äôt take the chance that my boy would be one of the unlucky ones. I knew I was taking on the burden of suffering so that he didn‚Äôt have to. I am comforted to know he knew nothing but love and warmth being cradled in my belly. I miss him and love him so much, but I know I did the right thing for him.

I‚Äôm so sorry you‚Äôre here, it really is the most painful thing ever. It‚Äôs terrible to have to make this choice for a baby whom you love so much, but as mothers, we have to do what‚Äôs best for our babies, which isn‚Äôt always easy. We‚Äôre all here for you.

I have also found that my grief waves are stronger at different times. Sometimes I can anticipate it (like Mother's Day) and other times it seems random, like I'll be driving home from work and start crying because I just miss my son.

Honestly, I could have written this exact post back in April, so I hope you find some comfort in knowing that there's other people out there who know precisely what you're going through.

I had the Panorama test done around 9+6. Three great ultrasounds before with the baby measuring perfectly to the day each time, heartbeat strong, all good signs but we did the test just to be safe. At 11+1, when I transitioned to my OB, they did an ultrasound that showed some concerning areas of fluid. I went back in at 11+5 for an official NT at a MFM and the NT measurement was 8.8-9; almost quadruple the normal value. Our results from the Panorama test came back the same day - positive for Trisomy 18.

They sent me to the genetic counselor who essentially said the same thing your MFM did - that the condition was pretty much diagnosed based on the abnormal ultrasound findings and the positive trisomy results. She said we could do the CVS but basically, our child would never have anything close to a normal life. We chose not to do the CVS. I would 100% not do this again - *please please please* get the CVS. It can tell you a) for absolute certain really, and b) if it's an issue caused by a complete trisomy or if it's a balanced translocation. I've been terrified since our loss that it's something that will happen again because of me/my husband's genes and I never got any kind of confirmation that it isn't. This should be able to tell you if this is something that might affect future children.

For your questions..

* I'm not sure we ever had anasarca diagnosed, but I wouldn't be surprised if it had occurred. There was fluid all over the place but mostly the back of the skull. I do remember at the original suspicious ultrasound that the doctor said there was fluid around the heart, but she did not give me a value - just said she was concerned because it typically meant chromosomal abnormalities.
* I suppose that means I had all three of your suspicious items - anasarca, NT, and positive blood test. While I never had the CVS to confirm 1000%, in my heart I know that's what it was.
* I don't know if you ever get to 100% on making the decision to TFMR. There are days I wonder if it was the right call. And then I think about what my child's life would have been like, and I know that it was. As it stood, the only thing my baby knew was warmth and love - no pain. It was the hardest thing I've ever had to decide, but for us, it wasn't *really* a decision. It's just something we knew we had to do once we got all this news. We had the procedure done at 12+1. Heartbeat was strong and the baby was still growing, but I know my own limits and I don't think I could have continued to carry just waiting for the day that I lost her. I wanted to say goodbye on a ""good"" note and not wait for the day her heart stopped or she was in pain or even If I got to hold her for five minutes. I just couldn't let her suffer just because *I* wanted her to be here.

Physical recovery was remarkably easy. Obviously, emotional recovery takes a little more time. I miss my little ladybug every day.

There are a few TFMR moms here that know what you're going through. I don't want to tag them exactly in case they find it triggering, but u / aeb949 and u / joh\_ah are some of the most eloquent, informative, and helpful people I've ""met"" while dealing with all this. They're also strong and brainy as hell with advanced medical backgrounds - I suggest taking a look back at their posts and seeing what their experiences were. 

I'm so very sorry that this is happening to you and your child. If you need anything whatsoever in the coming days, we are all here for you.

<p>I&#39;ve been trying to be happy to have this evidence that my body is getting back to normal.  I&#39;ve been trying to look forward to being able to try again. It&#39;s very hard to feel either of those things because just scratch at the surface and underneath I am very very sad that  my body has to get back to normal and that I have to try again. But I&#39;ve been here before, I&#39;m 2.5 years out from my first loss, and I can say with experience that you can carry on living your life, your body can go back to normal, and you can try again, all while remembering and honouring your lost one.</p>

The circumstances are different, in some cases, to yours but there are definitely women who understand what it's like to wait so long before having a baby to take home-- and then to lose that baby.  To lose that baby, and then not be able to conceive another soon after.  There are people here who understand... 

These are early days.  When I was in those early days, it was hard to comprehend that a time would come when I wasn't crying every day, much less anything beyond.  I can't say it ever gets ""easy"", but things do improve as you heal.

Healing takes time, and everyone goes through it at their own pace and in their own way.  The only thing you can do right now is grieve your son and do the best you can to take care of yourself.  

I found going to a parent support group for perinatal loss helpful.  My support group happened to be only couples with later losses (late-second tri to term), some NICU losses, some losses during labor, some involving c-sections and the same wait to heal. It was somehow a comfort to meet people IRL who had gone through something similar and ""got it"".   We found groups via our hospital and our OB.

It&#39;s not fair that we lose our babies to these &quot;rare&quot; tragedies (my son had a condition that affects 1 in 1-3 million babies).  It&#39;s doubly unfair when the loss is a baby conceived after a struggle with RPL or via IVF after years of infertility, or when complications from the loss create fertility problems, or when required healing from things like c-sections mean a longer wait to get pregnant again.  The circumstances are different, in some cases, to yours but there are definitely women who understand what it&#39;s like to wait so long before having a baby to take home-- and then to lose that baby.

Having been through a TFMR, I *do* think it's helpful to be as sure as you can before making the decision (understanding that laws impose time limits that sometimes make this challenging).  We love our babies, and it's often important to us in the grieving and healing to know that we did everything we could for them--we gave them every chance.  A TFMR is hard enough--lingering doubts or ""what-ifs"" would be harder.

You're right that full placental mosaicism is rare, but if you have those doubts, have the time for an amnio before you have to make a decision about TFMR, and think you can handle the wait emotionally while caring for your toddler it's very reasonable to pursue the follow-up you're considering.  

Talking to your MFM may change your perspective--or not.  The important thing is that you feel that whatever decision you make is best for you and your family.

When they decided to stop and be childfree, she said they both found hobbies that included being caring in a parental way. He coaches soccer for young children and she volunteers at their library. It does sound healing in a way.</p>

I'm almost 7 months out from my loss and when I was in the early days what helped me was to read stories of women and men who were months or years out from their losses.  So, I'm going to tell you about where I'm at now and if its helpful I'm glad, if its not just ignore my post. 

* My husband and I also decided to wait at least a year to try again, but I had second thoughts about a month out and wanted to start trying.  In the end, he applied for and was granted a sabbatical from work and i applied for and was granted long service leave (an aussie thing - basically paid time off after you've worked in the same place for a long time) - so we are both being paid but off work as of the end of Sept, til late Jan.  We never actually TTC'd and have now definitely decided to put it off at least until we're back at work, and we are going to try our best to take full advantage of this time off.  What I'm saying is - if you stick to your 1 year plan of not TTC I would recommend working in lots of things to look forward to, whether its travel, shows, whatever you like to do - it makes the waiting and the healing easier. FTR, we are unsure if we will try again, but if we do it won't be til 2019.
* I disassociated (too strong a word, but hopefully you know what I mean) a lot in the beginning. I binged whole tv shows, slept a lot, read fantasy books, whatever worked.  The first month, month and a half after my loss is very fuzzy because I wasn't present for a lot of it. I don't think its had a negative effect, and I think its helped me heal.  So don't feel bad doing that if its what you need.
* 7 months on, I do feel so much better. I'm not the same person I was, by a long shot.  But I have lots and lots of happy times and I can be around babies again.  
* 7 months on, I still get triggered by the strangest of things, but my sadness is almost welcome because it reconnects me with my son.  It's rarely overwhelming these days - I usually need some time to recover but I can get through whatever I'm doing even when I'm sad.
* I went back to work 4 weeks after my loss and for me, it was a good move, but everyone is different.  It was a distraction and it forced me to be able to talk to people about my loss without breaking down every time.  Work is still something I can throw myself into if I need a distraction on a particularly tough day. 
* I got a tattoo and it has been a huge step for me in my healing. 
* 3-4 months post loss for me was probably the worst time overall.  It was a grind and everything felt grey around me.  My due date was about 4 1/2 months post loss and although it was an awful day it was cathartic in moving forward for me. I went away to a beach house for the weekend (it was also my birthday, whomp whomp), took lots of time for myself, wrote a letter to my son and basically just soaked in the sadness.  I came out of that weekend feeling more like myself than i had since the loss. 
* You will get through this. You will feel pain unlike anything else but you will get through it.

I won't reiterate most of what the other's said, I will just add that if you have the option of doing CVS vs. amnio, I would strongly consider the amnio, if waiting a little longer works for your timeline.  

The miscarriage risk is lower, but it's also better because it checks DNA from the baby (in contrast to CVS, which biopsies the placenta).  The ""fetal"" DNA in the mom's blood (i.e. what the NIPT analyzes) comes primarily from the placenta--because that's what's in contact with mom's blood supply.  Most of the time, the placenta and fetal DNA match.  But in rare cases, the placenta develops a mutation as it develops....a mutation that the baby does not carry.  It's called placental mosaicism.  It's rare, but when it happens, it's something that only amnio can detect.  

Also, the NIPT companies post ""false positive"" stats that make it appear that these tests are nearly infallible.  But the real number you're interested in is the ""positive predictive value"" or PPV.  That's the number of ""positive"" NIPT results that actually turn out to be positive in diagnostic testing.   

For example, Natera says that their PPV for T21/T18/T13/Turner's together is 82-87% (lower for women >35)....though when hospital settings perform their own analyses, the numbers are typically a little lower (~75%)    When broken out by condition, PPV for T21 is highest, T18 performs a little worse, and the PPV for T13 is lowest at ~50%...   These kinds of numbers still don't make me feel good...but a 1 in 7 or a 1 in 4 or a 1 in 3 chance of the baby *not* having the trisomy is much better than a 1 in 1000 chance....  Definitely have the specialist review not just the raw risk number, but also the PPV numbers for your situation with you when you meet.  

ETA: The diagnostic test should be able to determine whether a trisomy is due to a ""whole"" extra chromosome 18 being present, or due to a balanced translocation.  Whole extra chromosomes are generally considered ""bad luck"" and unlikely to happen again.  Balanced translocations are something present either in mom or dad, and so could be passed on to another child.  But they are more rare, and at this stage, I would just focus on understanding your NIPT results and getting your diagnostic test set up.

I had the blood drawn again, and that time it took almost 3 weeks to come back. While we were waiting for those results, we had our NT scan, which showed significant abnormalities (a large cystic hygroma and hydrops--basically, lots of fluid inside the baby where it shouldn't be) that are most commonly associated with chromosomal anomalies. The radiologist doing the ultrasound told us fetal demise would likely occur in the next few weeks. After that, our OB was amazing and got us in the same day with some MFM specialists downtown, and they did chorionic villus sampling (I wasn't quite far along enough for an amnio, but that's what they would have done if I was a bit further along). In the end, we had our diagnosis from the chorionic villus sampling before our NIPT results came in. But when they did, they were consistent with the ultimate diagnosis.

‚Äã

In one of your comments below, you asked why an amnio would be required to confirm. This is because **NIPT is a screening test**, whereas **chorionic villus sampling and amniocentesis are diagnostic tests**. **A screening test is used to determine how likely it is that someone has a particular condition.** These tests tend to be quite sensitive, but not necessarily that specific (i.e., they tend to have a higher rate of false positives). The purpose of a screening test is to identify who would benefit most from follow-up testing (i.e., a diagnostic test). **A diagnostic test is used to determine with 100% accuracy whether or not a particular condition is present.**

‚Äã

As an example, **a mammogram is a type of screening test**. Everyone gets one after a certain age, and the purpose of this is to identify which women are more likely than others to have breast cancer (i.e., women who have lumps or calcifications on mammogram are more likely to have breast cancer than women who don't have these things). But there are plenty of non-cancerous things that can lead to lumps and calcifications. For example, some women just have lumpy breasts--it's normal for them. Or maybe they had a lump removed years ago and it left scar tissue behind that looks kind of funny. **The diagnostic test is actually getting a sample of the concerning tissue (i.e., a biopsy) and looking at it under a microscope**. You need to actually look at the individual cells to diagnose cancer because cancer is when your cells are dividing out of control and are no longer normal-appearing. So, **lots of women will screen positive with the mammogram, but only some of these women will actually have cancer cells under the microscope.**

‚Äã

I hope that helps clarify things! I bolded the important parts in case you didn't feel like reading the whole thing--I ended up writing too much!

‚Äã

The bottom line is that I highly recommend getting chorionic villus sampling or an amniocentesis if you can. It gave us a lot of peace of mind to have the 100% certain diagnosis before terminating. This test can also give you other useful information about how likely it is that this kind of thing will happen again (the answer is generally ""highly unlikely,"" but there is a small number of people who are predisposed to certain aneuploidies based on their own genetic makeup).

‚Äã

I'm so sorry you're going through this. The initial phase of testing and uncertainty was the hardest for us. Thinking of you, and please feel free to reach out if you have any other questions.

In general, though, my understanding is that the false positive rate can be fairly high if you're low risk (i.e., <35yo with no preexisting medical conditions) and if there are no obvious ultrasound abnormalities. Have you had an ultrasound recently? The positive predictive value of any test goes up as the probability of that outcome goes up (e.g., a young person might screen positive for a certain type of cancer, but it's much more likely to be a false positive in that young person than it would be in an old person--cancer rates increase astronomically with age). But the last time I looked into this, it seemed like there weren't great numbers regarding false positive rates except for women >35yo (because these tests are best studied in women >35yo). So, if you aren't >35yo, there might not be much data out there, unfortunately.

<p>In general, though, my understanding is that the false positive rate can be fairly high if you&#39;re low risk (i.e., &lt;35yo with no preexisting medical conditions) and if there are no obvious ultrasound abnormalities.

Now they‚Äôre done though I‚Äôm really glad, it‚Äôs something I can touch to feel closer to them and I like that‚Äôs it permanent and shows that they will never be forgotten.</p>

First cycle!  First ""normal"" cycle!  Perfect timing this cycle!  It was a roller coaster of hope and disappointment.  

One thing that helped me is finding some stats that it *can* take a while after a loss to get pregnant again.  From the miscarriage literature, the median was 5-6 cycles...so half of couples who got pregnant again took under 5-6 cycles, the other half took longer.  All the stories you come across about people getting pregnant again as soon as they started trying again made the first couple tries harder for me--you don't hear as much about the people who took longer.  So it was good to know we were ""normal"" in not immediately getting pregnant again.  

Another thing that helped me was that I started taking pictures on my phone of my thermometer after O-day/my temp rise.  But I didn't enter anything into my tracking app until the end of my cycle.  Getting a break from the morning reminder of what DPO I was really helped me forget a little about TTC, when to test, etc.  and just kind of go about my life a little more.

My bereavement counselor was also helpful.

I'd be like, ""Why am I having a bad week?""  And then with the counselor, I'd realize, ""Oh yeah, *this* is happening, *and* *this* is happening, too.""  That outlet and support was helpful.  

Some people, I think, feel more discouraged with each cycle that doesn't work out, but for me, it actually got easier after the first 3 cycles--somehow I was putting less pressure on the whole thing and I kind of recalibrated my hopes/expectations for our timeline a little bit.

I burst into tears in the middle of the store we were in like a five year old. I‚Äôm so angry and hurt by how insensitive that was to say in front of me only days after. Of course I want them to have a healthy happy family, but it‚Äôs not like they‚Äôre eight months pregnant and needed to hash that out that second. They could have had that conversation in private. </p>

Thanks very much for sharing it. The study population was women of ‚Äúadvanced maternal age‚Äù. I‚Äôm 31 so I don‚Äôt fall into that category. Makes me wonder if the results would apply to me or not. I guess there is no way to know. Most of the studies I could find on this topic are in the older population or are looking at a population with a specific known genetic problem like a balanced translocation. I couldn‚Äôt find anything that looks at unexplained recurrent miscarriages in younger women. Do you know of any studies like this or have any more thoughts on the issue?

So I expect my hcg was lower than 10 k when I had the d&c.

On Aug 3 my hcg was 68, and on Aug 8 it was 31. That was the last beta I did.

So now it is Aug 26 with the faint line on FRER.

I have been getting negatives on easy@home for over a week ...but since these are not as sensitive as FRER I am cautious.

Any insight welcome. The pics of today's tests are in my post history .

I am so anxious to take another test tomorrow morning because I want it to darken so badly :s",[],,t1_e4vktae,False,0,[],False,"<div class=""md""><p>This morning (possibly 9 DPO) I got a faint but pink line on FRER.
