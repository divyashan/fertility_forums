While it is technically possible to get pregnant again before your first period, we decided to wait because I needed to know my dating. With my MMC, I was told 50/50, I either ovulated late or I was going to miscarry. It ended up being the latter, but I never wanted to not know again.

It's shit going through that. All fine one moment and the next not. Took me a little while to get out of that funk way of thinking. The waiting around for results or appointments suck. It's like limbo, but not the fun kinda limbo.

For the pain have you got painkillers? I had a hot water bottle that was constantly being re heated (I got a lamb style Teddy that you put in the microwave. I spray lavender on it too to help with calming). Hot showers and blankets! If the pain becomes too much, make sure you go to see someone.

My OH keeps saying we've got plenty of time (me 26 and him 30), but I kept telling him that ""everyone has a purpose or a goal on life.

You will both be back to being happy again, just remember to be honest with each other. If you're having a shit day, have a cry or rant with him (or vice versa).

I've had a MC (2017Sept@6weeks) and a MMC (2018July@12weeks-showing as 7weeks). Both very different experiences, and I dealt with them very differently.

My most recent was the toughest moment I have ever had to go through in my whole life (I'm 26). After I had my 12week scan I MC naturally. I remember just feeling empty, numb and lost. Like you, every decision I made in the best interest of my little plum (decided to name it plum). So when that was taken away, it was hard to grasp onto that ""what now?"". Think I felt like that for 2 months. 

Everyday does get better. It may not seem it now, but it does. It is just about taking it a day at a time. If I could go back in time, I would tell myself that. I was just thinking tonight how far I have come since July. First few weeks were hard as I made plans around being pregnant, and when it came to doing those plans it was tough. I cried, a lot. I talked about it, a lot. But, I got through it. And I'm still here to tell my story so I can help others, like you hopefully! I felt being honest about how you're feeling helps. It is also tough trying to explain it to someone who hasn't gone through it themselves. How it feels. But it'll get easier to tell your story. 
Don't let anyone make you feel that you're being too 'emotional' about your experience. Your feelings are valid. Your feelings are valid today, tomorrow, next month, forever!

With the trying again, we're waiting til January. So it'll be 6 months I've waited. Only for personal reasons. My OH has been struggling with the loss (even though he tells me he's alright about it, I know it still hurts him).

Like you, every decision I made in the best interest of my little plum (decided to name it plum). So when that was taken away, it was hard to grasp onto that &quot;what now?&quot;. Think I felt like that for 2 months. </p>

<p>Everyday does get better. It may not seem it now, but it does. It is just about taking it a day at a time. If I could go back in time, I would tell myself that. I was just thinking tonight how far I have come since July. First few weeks were hard as I made plans around being pregnant, and when it came to doing those plans it was tough. I cried, a lot. I talked about it, a lot. But, I got through it. And I&#39;m still here to tell my story so I can help others, like you hopefully! I felt being honest about how you&#39;re feeling helps. It is also tough trying to explain it to someone who hasn&#39;t gone through it themselves. How it feels. But it&#39;ll get easier to tell your story. 
Don&#39;t let anyone make you feel that you&#39;re being too &#39;emotional&#39; about your experience. Your feelings are valid. Your feelings are valid today, tomorrow, next month, forever!</p>

<p>With the trying again, we&#39;re waiting til January. So it&#39;ll be 6 months I&#39;ve waited. Only for personal reasons. My OH has been struggling with the loss (even though he tells me he&#39;s alright about it, I know it still hurts him).</p>

<p>I&#39;m sorry if this just feels like ramblings of an idiot! 😂 We&#39;re are all here for you ❤️ </p>

Now that the fibroid has shrunk, and is likely hanging out in the walls of my uterus, we aren’t going to do anything about it. The only worry was the way it was misshaping my uterus and how that might inhibit getting pregnant and keeping a pregnancy in the future. Now that it is in the walls/muscle there’s nothing to do.

I don't fall under exactly what you're asking about, but I'm pretty close. I had a miscarriage/D&C back in September, 3 months ago. I did have a period in October, BFP in November.

I can only answer a few of your questions - my husband and I decided to wait until our first ultrasound to tell close family and friends, rather than immediately after the first BFP. We lost our first around 7 weeks, so we wanted to wait until my 8-week appointment to make sure everything was on track. Plus, we are officially further along than what we were before. That gives us peace of mind. We will be going ""public"" with everything probably around the time I'm out of the first trimester, around Christmas.

We had a shock at my appointment on Tuesday after finding out that I'm carrying twins. This strangely comforts me because I'm going to be monitored more simply because of multiples. We will have more ultrasounds and more appointments in general, so I figure less time to worry in between.

In terms of symptoms, I'm feeling them a lot more, in fact, I had to get a prescription from my doctor for morning sickness. I'm taking this with a grain of salt because I'm carrying multiples right now. However, I have had no bleeding/spotting as I had before, so that's a relief in and of itself.

I obviously can't answer about carrying to term, but my doctor is pretty sure that isn't going to happen, but I may be 3-4 weeks early.

No matter how brief our angels were in our bellies we held them and loved them and did the best we could to keep them safe. They will always be in our hearts. 

I had no symptoms of the mc until after I was told his heart had stopped beating, my belly started to change shape at 10 weeks even though baby has passed the week before. It was diagnosed as a MMC on a Wednesday, I started bleeding Thursday, and had D&C Friday. 

My husband and I both had instinctual feelings that something was wrong. A few days before my appointment I broke down hysterically crying for no real reason other than I had a feeling of impending doom. DH told me later that he had a dream- that he didn’t share with me until after MMC- around the 9 week mark that his grandmother was holding the baby and told him that our baby was a boy. 

Thanksgiving is rough and oddly ironic- I’m sure that the holiday may never be the same for you and I am so sorry for that. I hope one day you will be able to celebrate the day in honor of your baby. Holidays and special occasions such as birthdays seem to be a horrific reminder of “what should be” rather than what is and so far it seems that most people do not understand how difficult it is for us- especially when it is so new. 

I think I’m past the point where people are thinking about my loss-they have moved on and expect that I have as well. 

I’m am trying to learn to just appreciate the time I did have with him. Every month before AF/getting pregnant I would tell myself that no matter what the outcome is I should be grateful every second to have the opportunity to be able to carry a child and that’s what I try to remind myself, that’s how I try to cope with the loss.

The recent research I've read indicates it *is* safe to try again immediately after a miscarriage.  However, it's not a bad idea to track your hGC back down.  It can take some women 6-7 weeks to see their hGC go back down to a BFN (a minority even have some after a period).  The last thing that anyone who is TTCAL needs is a ""BFP"" that they aren't sure is a ""true"" BFP.  Tracking your hGC back down helps you avoid that and is also reassurance that there's no retained tissue.  (hGC can also react with OPKs, so again, if you don't know where it's at, you might get some confusing trends with your OPKs.)

The best numbers I've seen in the medical literature for ""time to conceive"" after a miscarriage do not support the idea that you're more fertile after a MC.  Something like 20% are pregnant within 3 cycles of TTC after a miscarriage.  (This research *does* support the idea that there's no advantage to waiting, though.)  A few women here have gotten a BFP soon after their MC, but for many, it can take longer than it took TTCing with their loss.  Part of it is probably because cycles can be wonky after a loss.  

My fingers will be crossed that your TTCing efforts are met with quick success.  But if it does take longer than the first time, I just want you to know that that's very common.

Right now, though, everything is very fresh.  Just focus on taking care of yourself, grieving, and letting yourself feel however you feel--good day or bad.  <3",[],,t1_eb8uil2,False,0,[],False,"<div class=""md""><p>I&#39;m sorry for your loss.  </p>

TW - living child.

I had 6 miscarriages over 2 1/2 years. Throughout that time I had my progesterone levels tested, a blood test on cycle day 21, an ultrasound of my ovaries same day, and a RPL panel. My husband and I had karotyping. Everything came back normal.

After my second miscarriage my GP put me on low dose aspirin and progesterone (to take when I had a positive pregnancy test) as a precaution, obviously it didn't work. After the fourth miscarriage we took a break and decided we would see a specialist. He ran the RPL again, plus a hystereoscopy, and extra blood tests for clotting factors - again everything was normal. On our original visit he told me to have hope because I was young (31 at the time) and that most woman who have unexplained loss go on to have a family. He said that there is new and promising research in the field and he was confident that I would finally bring a baby home. He gave me a prescription for double the dose of progesterone (to take from ovulation), low dose aspirin, and clexane.

I ended up having another miscarriage. I started the prescriptions after my positive test because we weren't trying at the time (foolish, as we weren't preventing either). After that Mc, I began temping and started the progesterone at ovulation, ended up pregnant, and carrying to term. 

I have no idea if any of the medications had anything to do with the successful pregnancy as my progesterone levels were always fine previously and I didn't have any discernable clotting issues. I was a mess until about 16w and then I was cautiously optimistic until about 36w. I thought for sure something would go wrong, but now I have a beautiful boy who was worth every bit of pain and heartache.

Its difficult to say if we would have kept going if we had more losses, but I saw some advice on the sub previously that I felt very apt. Keep going until the pain of loss is greater than the pain of never bringing a baby home. 

After my first loss my midwife told me that some woman may have five or six losses before bringing a baby home.

I say you give it at least 2 tries before IVF. It isn't very expensive or invasive. I got pregnant on my second round of IUI (combined with clomid and trigger shot).

One loss is never easy, let alone 5, and without answers that makes it even harder. Hugs, hugs, hugs. 

I have 2 living children and a third (hopefully) on the way. I'm 11 weeks today. Since we started trying in 2012 I've had a blighted ovum MC 6w, CP #1, healthy baby #1, CP #2 and #3, a fetal demise at 13w with D&C after the genetic panel and testing came back normal, CP #4, a partial molar with assisted MC at 6 weeks, healthy baby #2, a suspected CP (I had the symptoms but no line, only a late period), then this pregnancy. 

After the PM and before baby #2 we sought help from a fertility specialist. I was mid 30s and worried about age related issues. All my initial hormonal Labs were negative, no PCOS, no abnormal reproductive cycle levels, but I was going to have a full genetic/clotting disorder panel done as well as a hysteroscopy 3 weeks from the first appointment and start clomid after. What we did different was a change in  diet and lifestyle immediately after we left our first appointment . The doctor ordered a strict low carb high fat diet for me and my husband, and I was not to do any stressful exercise but light weights and yoga were ok. 3 days before my procedure I found out I was pregnant with our now baby #2. I stayed on the lchf diet as long as I could which was 7 weeks. 

When we started trying for #3 I avoided the lchf diet and continued my intense workout routine with some modifications. That's when we had the suspected CP. So back on the diet and decreased exercise I went, and that month had success. I also (due to age) started taking ubiquinol 200mg per day and so did my husband, 6 months before TTC baby #2 and then with this pregnancy. Research says you need 3 months of use for any effectiveness.

In your case I would consider having both you and your husband tested for genetic abnormalities. Repeat losses are not always due to female reproductive issues. Early losses can be caused by hormonal issues such as low estrogen, clotting disorders, but also by abnormalities in the sperm. Many issues can be treated or assisted. Is your OB open to pursuing workup for these losses? A referral to a reproductive endocrinologist may be helpful. 

I also want to add that my cousin's wife had hormone issues, started medication and was pregnant the next month, had 3 early losses then a second successful pregnancy, 2 more early MC then a 3rd healthy pregnancy. I also have another friend with 3 early losses in a row and then a healthy baby boy.

This is a long read I know, but I would encourage you to not lose hope and to seek answers. The hardest part is the waiting and the long space between the previous loss and when you decide to try again, even as every ovulation passes by. It's ok to take a cycle or two to investigate and to not feel pressured to get pregnant (if that's something you would consider). We are all here for you if you need us.

We definitely will be celebrating his birthday! He’s still our son and we want to celebrate his life, even though he didn’t live outside my womb. Finishing the nursery is something that we both felt very strongly about, and it was because we wanted to acknowledge he existed and still does. I did think about taking everything down and putting it away, but ultimately felt like finishing it was the right thing to do! I totally understand why most take it down, it can be very painful to go into his nursery. The first time after it was finished, I was an absolute wreck. My husband is the one that actually finished it, I stayed out in the living room while he did it. I think it was very cathartic for him to do, it made him feel more involved, even though Charlie was already gone. 

I’ve only admitted my feelings towards my husband to two of my friends, and now reddit LOL. I’m sure one day I’ll tell him how I felt, but if I did that now I’m sure he’d be extremely hurt. I don’t like to keep my feelings from him, so maybe in a few years I’ll share those thoughts with him. 

My families responses were pretty much what I expected, except for my husbands stepfather. He’s normally very cold towards us, but we could tell he was absolutely devastated and he was so kind and compassionate towards us. We were both blown away by his actions! My grandmas loss has always been talked about and acknowledged, so I’m grateful that it was never hidden from me and that I was able to identify with her because of it and that it wasn’t just something that was brought up after my loss. It also made me feel like being open about our loss would be handled gracefully and understood by our family. I’m so proud of how my grandmother always talked about it, it was so frowned upon back then and still is to this today to be so open. It must have been incredibly hard for her to do. The most surprising thing for me is the amount of people that came to me with stories of their family’s / friends’ losses with offers to connect me with them! I’m a very private person, which may be why I don’t feel comfortable reaching out just yet. 

And thank you, same goes to you!!! And I don’t think it’s horrible at all. It’s so comforting to know we are not alone in our suffering, I think it’s because it helps to know that we weren’t singled out, that it happens and nothing we could do can change it. If it only happened to one person, I would imagine it would be an incredibly lonely existence in that pain.

I've gone through a health care journey over the last few years to get where I am now (21.5 weeks pregnant). Everyone's story is different, but maybe something here will give you an idea or at least hope. 

First 2 OBs* were fine with my TSH being around 5.5 and wouldn't authorize a higher dose of my thyroid meds to bring it into pregnancy range (<2.5). They also weren't willing to try early progesterone supplementation (starting a few days after ovulation) despite my consistently low numbers (pg of 5.1 at 5 weeks pregnant). 

Found an OB and endo to address these issues. OB also started me on low-dose aspirin to try addressing thin endometrium. 

Then discovered I was diabetic: had been pre-diabetic according to yearly a1c tests, but endo thinks each pregnancy caused blood sugar to spike, which could have caused problems (and indeed, after diagnosis, blood sugar suddenly rising was my first clue I was pregnant). I guess after this happened 3 times, my body finally had enough and tipped into full-blown diabetes. Have a great nurse who keeps close tabs on me during the pregnancy, and my control is awesome.

Gallbladder was also going bad, and I wound up having it removed last spring. No idea if that had an effect.

That said, there's no way to know what, if anything, made the difference. It could simply be that those 3 MC were due to chromosomal abnormalities and were never going to make it. And treatments like early progesterone and low-dose aspirin aren't scientifically proven -- though like most of us on this board, our opinion was, ""Can't hurt to try...""

It's important to find doctors who are willing to listen to your concerns and not write off things like high TSH as being, ""You need to stay off Dr. Google."" (American Thyroid Association wasn't authoritative enough for him, I suppose: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3472679/)

*Re: firing previous OBs: I am not a diva and didn't fire two OBs lightly. I certainly didn't fire them only on the basis of MC. But the first one dismissed my concerns about how much I was bleeding with the first MC (filling a maternity pad every 30 minutes) and said it was normal. A friend saw me a few hours later and said, ""OMG, you're white as a sheet! Get your butt to the ER!"" Sure enough, I needed a blood transfusion and a D&C for incomplete MC. They said I could have died if I had waited much longer. The other OB was the one who condescendingly told me to stay off Dr. Google, and he would also walk into the room with absolutely no idea what was going on -- clearly hadn't even bothered to glance at my chart before walking in. Husband and I sat in his office for an hour talking about the first MC and hearing what his strategy would be once we got pregnant again. Two months later, we were in there pregnant.

I&#39;ve gone through a health care journey over the last few years to get where I am now (21.5 weeks pregnant). Everyone&#39;s story is different, but maybe something here will give you an idea or at least hope. </p>

<p>First 2 OBs* were fine with my TSH being around 5.5 and wouldn&#39;t authorize a higher dose of my thyroid meds to bring it into pregnancy range (&lt;2.5). They also weren&#39;t willing to try early progesterone supplementation (starting a few days after ovulation) despite my consistently low numbers (pg of 5.1 at 5 weeks pregnant). </p>

<p>Found an OB and endo to address these issues. OB also started me on low-dose aspirin to try addressing thin endometrium. </p>

<p>Then discovered I was diabetic: had been pre-diabetic according to yearly a1c tests, but endo thinks each pregnancy caused blood sugar to spike, which could have caused problems (and indeed, after diagnosis, blood sugar suddenly rising was my first clue I was pregnant). I guess after this happened 3 times, my body finally had enough and tipped into full-blown diabetes. Have a great nurse who keeps close tabs on me during the pregnancy, and my control is awesome.</p>

<p>Gallbladder was also going bad, and I wound up having it removed last spring. No idea if that had an effect.</p>

1.  Honestly, I thought we would make it. I didn't let the thought even cross my mind that he wouldn't make it. I think my husband knew though. I distinctly remember the drive to the hospital the morning he died, we were holding hands and my husband said ""Are you ready for this"" and I said ""Absolutely not"".  I truly, truly was thinking we would be one of those ""miracles"".  In retrospect, he was very unwell and had he lived, he probably wouldn't have had much of a life. I'm not saying I'm glad he didn't make it, because that's just so untrue - but I don't think at the time I knew exactly what him surviving would have looked like.
2. This really depends on the situation and my mood. I was in a work meeting and the woman I was meeting with asked if we had kids - that time, in an attempt to remain professional I said that we hope for kids in the future. That's not a lie.  At a hair appointment, she asked me if we had any kids and I said that we had a son, but we lost him shortly after birth - turned out she is currently struggling with infertility treatments and was glad to have someone to talk to. It's conflicting, because I was to tell everyone about him but ""Hi, would you like to hear about my dead child"" tends to freak most people out. I never want to betray him, or try to erase him - but sometimes I don't have the emotional capacity that day for other peoples reactions.
3. I have no idea what we might do for his birthday. I think we will just be together, my husband and I.  I don't know that I've consciously made an effort to normalize it. It took me a long time to be able to say his name without tears. But it is tattooed on my arm. His story will never not be part of me, or my story, so maybe just talking about my grief has helped.  I do and don't feel more grounded, in a way. I know he is gone, and that is true but I'm still reliving so much. So many ""this time last year"" thoughts. I still drift to what ifs - but it's much less than before. I've gone through all the things I could have done differently to change my outcome but there aren't any. We literally did everything we could.
4. Support group - Is run by our bereavement coordinator and is for all of the hospitals in our region. It is for miscarriages, pregnancy loss, TFMR's and neonatal loss. We all have different stories, but everyone is welcome.  It is facilitated by a former nurse, who also has 2 losses of her own. We open every meeting with a poem, and light a candle. Then we go around the circle and tell our story. Some people choose not to, especially fresh losses. And then we just go where the conversation goes, honestly.  Sometimes all I say in a meeting is our story. Sometimes I have more to help someone else with. Sometimes I need help. The meetings are 2 hours, and at the end of every meeting the names of babies with anniversaries that month are read - there is a calendar journal where you can write whatever you want to your child, and it will be read.  Some people have been coming for years. Some only come on their anniversary month now, decades after the fact. As the bereavement coordinator says ""This is a place, where for 2 hours, you are allowed to feel your grief so completely."". For two hours a month, I get to only think about how sad I am, and about my son.  We also have lots of resources - books and journals and colouring books and pins and bracelets.   I have made one friend - she also has an incompetent cervix, although that wasn't the reason for her loss.  But our bereavement program gives every family a bear with their memory box, and we are encouraged to donate bears - which we did for Declans due date. We donated 13 bears to the program.  This woman ended up with a Declan bear - who her daughter sleeps with every night.  We are just a little extra connected, and she feels special to me.
5. For me, I honestly never compared.  Had I had an early miscarriage before this loss, it would have wrecked me.  Now I only compare for myself, if that makes sense.  I know that now I would be able to handle the grief of a miscarriage a little easier than I could with the neonatal loss. A full term still birth would kill me, I think. TFMR would break my heart in different ways.  Even though I know loss, I still can't *really* imagine any other type of loss and the pain they bring to their parents. I've learned to be grateful that we got some time with him while he was living - that I got to see him kick and squirm and even drink some of my colostrum, because so so many loss parents have never had that chance.  
6. Grieving has fucking sucked. It just did - the first few months are honestly not even still in my brain. That fog and complete sadness is so empty. I know that we made an effort to get out of the house. We didn't go anywhere without each other though, and we spent a lot of time in bed.  Going back to work was hard - that was month three. Grief got softer over the summer for me, personally. The weather was nicer and I was exercising; we weren't trying again yet so there were no real stresses, fertility wise. My 30th birthday was in September and honestly it's been a downward trend since then - everything has gotten harder again, leading up to the anniversary. I don't always feel the pain so sharply as I did when we first lost him - but there are still moments that take my breath away with sadness. I still cry in the car and in the shower a lot.  I wouldn't say the pain has gotten better, but I have gotten better at - I was going to say managing it, but that isn't the right word - so I've gotten better at letting it exist when it needs to.  Some days, I just have to cry it out. And that's okay.  The pain is more of a constant dull ache than a wide open wound now, but it is always there
7. I really, honestly don't think I will buy anything until I make it to around 28 weeks. Even then, it will be sporadic - honestly we have most of what we would need for a newborn - a bassinet, lots of clothes, I even have a breast pump.  If a second baby came early and needed NICU time we would have lots of time to buy what we needed.  If I went to term, I know I could send my parents to Babies R Us with a list and some money and everything still needed would be at our house when we came home. I hope that I feel more optimistic in a second pregnancy, but for right now - and because I would be high risk (preventative cerclage placed at 12-14 weeks, progesterone suppositories and most likely bed rest) I think I will be anxiously holding my breath until I have a crying newborn in my arms.",[],,t1_eb5b4hb,False,0,[],False,"<div class=""md""><p>Okay, here we go!</p>

<ol>
<li> Honestly, I thought we would make it. I didn&#39;t let the thought even cross my mind that he wouldn&#39;t make it. I think my husband knew though. I distinctly remember the drive to the hospital the morning he died, we were holding hands and my husband said &quot;Are you ready for this&quot; and I said &quot;Absolutely not&quot;.  I truly, truly was thinking we would be one of those &quot;miracles&quot;.  In retrospect, he was very unwell and had he lived, he probably wouldn&#39;t have had much of a life. I&#39;m not saying I&#39;m glad he didn&#39;t make it, because that&#39;s just so untrue - but I don&#39;t think at the time I knew exactly what him surviving would have looked like.</li>
<li>This really depends on the situation and my mood. I was in a work meeting and the woman I was meeting with asked if we had kids - that time, in an attempt to remain professional I said that we hope for kids in the future. That&#39;s not a lie.  At a hair appointment, she asked me if we had any kids and I said that we had a son, but we lost him shortly after birth - turned out she is currently struggling with infertility treatments and was glad to have someone to talk to. It&#39;s conflicting, because I was to tell everyone about him but &quot;Hi, would you like to hear about my dead child&quot; tends to freak most people out. I never want to betray him, or try to erase him - but sometimes I don&#39;t have the emotional capacity that day for other peoples reactions.</li>
<li>I have no idea what we might do for his birthday. I think we will just be together, my husband and I.  I don&#39;t know that I&#39;ve consciously made an effort to normalize it. It took me a long time to be able to say his name without tears. But it is tattooed on my arm. His story will never not be part of me, or my story, so maybe just talking about my grief has helped.  I do and don&#39;t feel more grounded, in a way. I know he is gone, and that is true but I&#39;m still reliving so much. So many &quot;this time last year&quot; thoughts. I still drift to what ifs - but it&#39;s much less than before. I&#39;ve gone through all the things I could have done differently to change my outcome but there aren&#39;t any. We literally did everything we could.</li>
<li>Support group - Is run by our bereavement coordinator and is for all of the hospitals in our region. It is for miscarriages, pregnancy loss, TFMR&#39;s and neonatal loss. We all have different stories, but everyone is welcome.  It is facilitated by a former nurse, who also has 2 losses of her own. We open every meeting with a poem, and light a candle. Then we go around the circle and tell our story. Some people choose not to, especially fresh losses. And then we just go where the conversation goes, honestly.  Sometimes all I say in a meeting is our story. Sometimes I have more to help someone else with. Sometimes I need help. The meetings are 2 hours, and at the end of every meeting the names of babies with anniversaries that month are read - there is a calendar journal where you can write whatever you want to your child, and it will be read.  Some people have been coming for years. Some only come on their anniversary month now, decades after the fact. As the bereavement coordinator says &quot;This is a place, where for 2 hours, you are allowed to feel your grief so completely.&quot;. For two hours a month, I get to only think about how sad I am, and about my son.  We also have lots of resources - books and journals and colouring books and pins and bracelets.   I have made one friend - she also has an incompetent cervix, although that wasn&#39;t the reason for her loss.  But our bereavement program gives every family a bear with their memory box, and we are encouraged to donate bears - which we did for Declans due date. We donated 13 bears to the program.

I’m so sorry for your loss.  Wanting 2018 to just be over and start fresh is exactly how I felt in 2016 when I went through the same.

It absolutely takes a superhero to be a nurse.

All of my nurses/midwives/doctors were amazing when my son was stillborn. My only criticism of that time, which I think would have been easy for nurses to overlook, is that I really didn’t get much in the way of coaching or prep or support for the actual labour. I was induced at 32 weeks, a few days after we found out our son had passed away, so I hadn’t gone to any birthing classes nor had I at that point done much of my own research into what to expect during labour.

I also had a somewhat traumatic labour as my first labour failed completely after about 8 hours. It just stopped. I was induced again and laboured for another 8 hours before finally giving birth. I don’t even know when my waters broke - there was a moment where I was vomiting back up the misoprostal where I thought I’d peed myself but looking back that must have been the waters breaking. This is how clueless I was. I only knew it was time to push when I went to the bathroom and he was literally hanging out of me (breach baby) but the nurses never seemed too concerned about how dilated I was (they only checked once after I asked) and I was kind of in this constant state of, “please, just tell me what I’m supposed to be doing now, I don’t know what’s going on.” They did, however, actively manage me once I started pushing - lucky me, my contractions completely abandoned me at that point and I just had to push all on my own.

But all the little things that they did wonderfully:

- wrapped my baby to give him to me immediately after birth - they also encouraged my husband to cut the cord. They did actually discuss with me beforehand that they could deliver baby straight up onto my chest as they would normally, but for one I ended up doing the last push in a squat and then I kind of froze up and I think went into shock a little so this ended up being better. 

- after birth, I was almost entirely treated like any other mother who had just delivered a baby.

- they bathed, measured and dressed him for me at my request, and took photos of it all which we were given in a flash drive before we left. They also took a few extra photos of us with him even though we had a charity photographer come in and do professional shots. When we left they gave us a little bag with his hospital tags, the measuring tape the used for him, a crib card written up just like normal, and hand and foot prints.

- we were told to stay as long as we needed to, and our son stayed with us in a cooling crib - they never tried to take him away or rush us out. He was born at 8am on a Tuesday and we ended up staying until midday Wednesday. They’d also set up an extra bed next to mine so that my husband could sleep next to me. 

- they were quite thorough with advising what to expect physically in the coming weeks, including lactation (I actually started lactating during labour anyway), how to manage breast soreness, how I might be feeling down below, then sent in a physio to go over post partum exercises, and we saw a social worker a couple of times to help guide us through finding a funeral home and connecting us to grief services as well as Centrelink (social services as I was legally still entitled to paid parental leave). 

- once we named him, *everyone* used his name. Even new doctors coming in would have looked at our charts and known his name already. It was, and still is, surprisingly touching. They also naturally picked up that we were nicknaming him (his name is Albert, but right from the start we called him Albie) and started using that instead which was really perceptive.

- without fail, every person that came into that room was empathetic, kind and human. A couple of the midwives cried with me. A couple of them cried even when I didn’t. At least one of them came up to check on me when she was off shift. The midwife who was there when I came to the hospital to confirm my son had passed came up to check on me every day (we were there for four days). The barriers between nurse and patient really dropped away in those moments and made me feel much less alone.

- probably the single biggest thing: when it was time to leave, the head nurse asked if we’d like to leave Albie in the room or have him wheeled out ahead of us. I absolutely balked at having him “taken away” but of course it felt impossible to leave him, too. I think she saw my dilemma because she very gently offered to sit with him while we left. I can’t explain what that gesture meant to me. Walking out of that room without him was still the hardest thing I’ve ever done but knowing that he wasn’t alone, that he was being looked after, made it possible to do. I will never forget her for that.

I will never forget her for that. </p></li>

I found a paper from a couple years ago that had relatively good data on time to conception after a MC.  There's lots of nuances to the paper, which I won't get into, but the upshot is this:

For women who started ttc-ing again within 3 months of their loss, about 2/3's got pregnant within the time frame of the study (which was only 6-9 cycles after their loss).

So it's harder to appreciate what other patients might not get.  Much less things that haven't already been mentioned.

Ours was a TFMR loss (delivered after induction).  We appreciated that with each shift, the new nurse(s) would introduce themselves and tell us how sorry they were for our loss, like any other loss family.  Whatever I needed for comfort, they were happy to provide.  

I'll say that I delivered too early to have gone through a childbirth class, so I just kind of new what I'd read about in my pregnancy book.  We were under-prepared, and didn't get any sort of overview of what to expect from either the OBs or the nurses.  Things just kind of happened as they happened.  

Same for aftercare--it was an L&D nurse who first told me my milk might come in, and what the care for that would be.  (I also was given a folder after I got to the maternity ward, but it felt a little late.)  

We appreciated that the nurses took pictures and hand/footprints for us.  I wish I'd known the print taking would tear his skin, though.  They first gave him to us swaddled, so we couldn't really see him--just his face.  We had to ask if it was a boy or a girl, because he seemed so fragile and we didn't want to unwrap him ourselves.  Maybe it would have helped if the nurses had shown us how to handle him, and what we could do without ""hurting"" him.

I didn't want to take too many photos of him with all of the bits from labor on him. But when we handed him back to get cleaned up, they also took the prints.  So when we got him back, he was clean, but the skin on his little hands and feet were torn, and I felt bad about that.  And it made it challenging to take pictures that we felt we could show family.  

They also put a little knitted hat on him, which was cute, but because his skull was so soft, the knit deformed his skull.  So we never got a photo of his little bare head and his tiny soft hair.  

Overall, though, these are relatively small things.

One thing that I've seen mentioned by others is that when loss families are back in L&D for a subsequent pregnancy, they get asked things like, ""First baby?!""  Checking histories for previous losses is really appreciated.  

And then letting the mom set the tone.  PAL moms have a different experience than women who've never had a loss.  They may be feeling more worry about something going wrong during delivery than joy/excitement.  So acknowledging that and asking how they're feeling on that front will help you know what tone to take.

He was our first child and my due date is coming up. 

Apparently I had a placental separation and abruption that caused early labour, according to the pathology reports. 

I can say with all honesty that the care we received via NHS Scotland during and in the days after (in fact the bereavement service called me earlier today to see how I've been holding up) made the worst thing we could've imagined less bad, if that makes any sense. 

Mostly people were good about listening, and after we named him (we thought we had a few more months to decide) the staff used his name, which made it feel like even though he was here with us for just a few minutes, that we WAS here and that his life mattered. 

I need to add that partners need some looking after too. I had to go into emergency surgery since even pitocin wasn't delivering the placenta and I was bleeding out. My husband, who is typically very level headed, was frantic for hours terrified he'd lose me and his son in the same day. The staff updated him on my situation frequently. I was under general anesthesia and had to be brought out of it carefully. 

I had a dentist appointment I missed while in the hospital and the dentist said ""sorry about your miscarriage"" when I saw her two weeks later. I snapped at her ""it wasn't a miscarriage, he was born alive!"" and apologized right after. But it hurt to hear, even though miscarriage is sad and difficult. 

I had to hold my baby while he died in my arms. 

Let us cry, let us ramble, let us make dumb jokes, let us ask questions even in they might seem odd or silly. There's such a huge element of shock through most of this, we're not really ourselves. 

Thank you for reaching out and caring. I was relatively fortunate in my experience considering the quality and compassion of the care we got, but I've read stories of many couples that weren't as fortunate.

It’s good to talk about him and let my experiences out. Infant/pregnancy loss is kept behind such a shroud and as I said, needs to be acknowledged. Access to support should be more readily available because yes, it is a possible outcome for every pregnancy (no one ever mentions it as being so of course). 

My wait for my cesarean wasn’t too long - I was so low on platelets they were counting the minutes as I received donor units. I could not have been cut open without them without risking hemorrhage, hysterectomy, or death. Bring on the magnesium made me feel like I had the flu, I was so weak. I remember telling my husband I wanted to call our son Theo, and handing him my wedding rings. There were roughly 7 hours from arrival at the hospital to his birth if that gives you an idea. 
In the OR I was terrified. I kept trying to be strong and not cry so I laid there with tears running down my face silently while they ran an arterial line (?) (that HURT). My family doctor came in and held my other hand until I was under. I remember fighting the nurses at the last few moments because they kept trying to put the mask on me and tip my head back. I told my son I loved him and I was so sorry in my head a thousand times.

At first I compared. It made me feel good for a second, but then I would just feel guilty, because someone could be judging me in the same way. So I made an effort to stop and just empathize. Sometimes the comparisons step back in when I’m not expecting it, but I consciously remind myself that I have not walked in their shoes and while I understand the loss I cannot understand their experience. Support is incredibly important. Without somewhere safe to vent we would all be worse off because there are some things you cannot say to friends, family, who haven’t been through it. 

I feel betrayed in that this is something women are just supposed to be able to *do* and why didn’t my body get the message. So far this hasn’t extended to outside the TTC/pregnancy universe. 

I think that eventually, we will go in and clean it up a bit before TTC. It has things in there besides baby items, boxes we hadn’t unpacked from moving and filing cabinets and so forth. It’s a disaster zone really lol. I am planning for the worst and anticipating another difficult pregnancy, so I’d like to get it done while I’m physically capable.

I had just been to my growth ultrasound on Tuesday, October 30, 2018. Charles was perfect, his heartbeat was strong, lungs looked great, etc. He was measuring 5 lbs 5 oz and 19 inches long. He was so close to being mine! I was so beyond happy. Wednesday afternoon, I noticed he hadn’t been moving. I mentioned it to some coworkers and they told me to relax and try and get him moving when I got home. On my way home, I started getting some contractions and I got excited, and told myself he probably wasn’t moving much because of them. My contractions progressed pretty quickly, and by 9:00 am the next morning I was having them 4 minutes apart. He still hadn’t moved. I called my OBs office and they told me to get to Labor and Delivery right away. My husband was states away in Dallas, so I called him to let him know. I told him that he hadn’t been moving but not to worry, everything was going to be fine. It wasn’t. I got there and two nurses couldn’t find a heartbeat. That’s when I knew, he was gone. His heartbeat was always very strong and very quickly found. They told me that sometimes it’s hard when they are head down and to not freak out just yet. But I just knew it. My tears were just falling at this point, there was no stopping them. A doctor came in with an ultrasound, no heartbeat. He told me that there was no heartbeat, but he needed to have a second doctor confirm it. Which it was confirmed. My nurses were all visibly and audibly upset along with me, which honestly did comfort me. They left me alone in the room to sob in peace as I tried to find the strength to call my husband. It is the worst call I have ever had to make in my life. He was trying to get an early flight home for the arrival of our son, as my contractions were so close already, and then got a call that he’d be coming home to a dead baby. It was horrific. He stayed calm for me and got me to breathe and then called my mom for me so that I wouldn’t be alone. She lived an hour away from the hospital, so it took her some time to get there. 

It was agonizing to be alone because I realized it was the first time in 37 weeks (to the day) that I was truly alone. My Charlie had been with me every single day on my hour drives to work and all the times I was home alone while my husband traveled for work. And now he was gone. I was crying so much and so loud. There were a few times that I almost threw up because I was crying so hard. It was just horrible. I have never felt so alone and just so... sad. I felt empty and broken, like I’d never be happy again. This huge void just opened up and swallowed me. There are no words to describe the numbness you feel while also feeling like your whole body is in pain. My contractions were very painful, but for those first few hours, they pretty much melted away into the background as my emotional pain was just too much for me to notice anything else. 

The next 12 hours were the best and worst hours of my life. I would be delivering my son still. I tried to hold onto hope, that he’d be some miracle baby and the doctors were just plain wrong. But he wasn’t and they weren’t. My mother was incredible and helped immensely with my labor, she was absolutely perfect. My husband and father got to the hospital around 3:45 pm and at that point, I was 5 cm and in a LOT of pain. They didn’t have to induce me because my “body was doing what it is supposed to do” and that was one thing I was thankful for. I ended up getting an epidural and it was the right decision. We had parents and siblings come to the hospital to see us before Charlie arrived, and extended invitations for them to stay after so that they could meet him and say their goodbyes. I will forever treasure the pictures we got of our family holding our Charlie and I know that they will forever treasure their moments with him. I am so incredibly happy we made that decision and that he was showered with so much love, even if it came along with heartbreak and tears. 

My husbands experience was different in the sense that he was with his boss/friend when he got my call so he had someone for support when he first found out. But it was similar in the fact that he had a LOT of alone time to process it, as he had his flight home. He was very calm and strong for me, only breaking down when he first got there and hugging me and when his parents came in to see us before delivery. AFTER Charlie was born is a whole different story, he was absolutely crushed. He held him so much, and was very reluctant to let him out of his arms. He kept telling me that he felt complete with Charlie in his arms, and that when he was gone he felt like half of his body was gone. I hated seeing him so hurt, it was awful. But I honestly also got SO mad at him for being so upset. I know that sounds straight up awful, but I couldn’t help but feel resentful towards him. He was very disconnected the whole pregnancy, which is a very COMMON and NORMAL thing for men, as they aren’t feeling the physical and hormonal changes that we experience and so their relationship with the baby is just so different. And normally, logic would prevail, but it just wasn’t this time. I was so angry that he felt so incomplete, because HELLO!!??? How do you think I feel?! I grew a PERSON for 37 weeks with the promise of becoming a mother and that was all gone. I had felt the connection he was feeling for 37 long weeks. How dare he be this upset? I had the right to be this upset, not him. Which still makes me feel guilty, what a horrible thing to think and feel towards the love of my life. I probably always will feel that guilt. 

Medically, the entire medical staff was excellent. My husband and I cannot sing their praises enough. I will forever be grateful for the compassion they showed us. They took pictures of Charlie, similar to a newborn photo shoot, they made molds of his hands and his feet that we will always treasure, they cut his hair and gave it to us, they did foot prints and gave us the soap/brush that we used when we gave him his first bath (which letting us do was also amazing) and so many other things. They were just incredible. 

This subreddit is all that I have really interacted with in regards to the loss community. I’ve had some friends tell me that they know someone that had a loss and suggest I reach out to them, but I have no desire to do so at this point. Maybe one day I will, but not at this moment. It has been nice to see and hear of other people’s experiences and know that I am not alone. However, sometimes it upsets me that I am not alone, I wish that no one else had to experience this grief and hurt. It saddens me that it is so prevalent, and that nothing we can do will prevent these awful things from happening. And that even knowing that we did nothing wrong, most moms still blame ourselves anyway. Logic tells us we did everything we could, but guilt still finds a way. 

I did find myself comparing losses and I am so ashamed of that. This subreddit has definitely helped with that, reading others experiences has shown me that this hurt is shitty no matter how far along we all were or how it happened. Being a part of the Dead Kid Club isn’t fun for anyone and is truly horrific for everyone. 

My view of pregnancy. I’m terrified. But I also have this almost primal urge to be pregnant again. I want to be a mom, in every possible way. I am a mom to Charlie, I believe that wholeheartedly and will fight anyone that would ever cruelly say otherwise. But I want to snuggle my baby, and sing my baby to sleep and see my family SMILING at my baby as he or she holds their finger or opens her or his eyes. I want to put my car seat in my car and take my baby on shopping trips. I want my baby to cry and breathe. I also know I need to let my body heal, which is extremely frustrating. Plus, I know I’m going to be a total basket case when I’m pregnant again. Everything is going to scare me. 

Living life has changed in small ways. Quiet bothers me now, because I always think about how my house should be filled with baby cries. My husband and I will be laughing at something one of us said, and then we will just get quiet, like we are both thinking “how can we be happy and laughing when our son is dead?” Relationships, I have gotten closer with my grandmother. Her first pregnancy ended in a full term stillbirth as well, his name was Michael. A lot of painful memories have been brought up for her, and I’m so happy that we are spending more time together and just existing and talking about our babies. My friends all have babies. We were all pregnant together. I was the last one of us to give birth. They don’t invite me over anymore, probably because they think they are protecting me. But if Charlie was here, I’d be over every day and we’d be having mommy days together. I still want to do those things, I just won’t have my baby in my arms. By not inviting me, they’re hurting me. But I get it, I know they think they’re doing the right thing. 

His nursery was pretty much finished. My husband finished it on his due date, which was November 22nd. He died November 1st. We go into his nursery and snuggle the teddy bear that his ashes are in. I go in and just smell the baby smell and talk aloud to him, like I did when I was pregnant and alone with him. 

If you have any more questions, just message me. I’m more than happy to answer anything, it helps to talk about him and what happened.

I am a mom to Charlie, I believe that wholeheartedly and will fight anyone that would ever cruelly say otherwise. But I want to snuggle my baby, and sing my baby to sleep and see my family SMILING at my baby as he or she holds their finger or opens her or his eyes. I want to put my car seat in my car and take my baby on shopping trips. I want my baby to cry and breathe. I also know I need to let my body heal, which is extremely frustrating. Plus, I know I’m going to be a total basket case when I’m pregnant again. Everything is going to scare me. </p>

<p>Living life has changed in small ways. Quiet bothers me now, because I always think about how my house should be filled with baby cries. My husband and I will be laughing at something one of us said, and then we will just get quiet, like we are both thinking “how can we be happy and laughing when our son is dead?” Relationships, I have gotten closer with my grandmother. Her first pregnancy ended in a full term stillbirth as well, his name was Michael. A lot of painful memories have been brought up for her, and I’m so happy that we are spending more time together and just existing and talking about our babies. My friends all have babies. We were all pregnant together. I was the last one of us to give birth. They don’t invite me over anymore, probably because they think they are protecting me. But if Charlie was here, I’d be over every day and we’d be having mommy days together. I still want to do those things, I just won’t have my baby in my arms. By not inviting me, they’re hurting me. But I get it, I know they think they’re doing the right thing. </p>

<p>His nursery was pretty much finished. My husband finished it on his due date, which was November 22nd. He died November 1st. We go into his nursery and snuggle the teddy bear that his ashes are in. I go in and just smell the baby smell and talk aloud to him, like I did when I was pregnant and alone with him. </p>

<p>If you have any more questions, just message me. I’m more than happy to answer anything, it helps to talk about him and what happened. </p>

I think something that is important to remember is that you may have seen this (baby loss) many times but for the people, this is often brand new and the biggest shock of their lives. They don’t know what to expect, they don’t know what they will see, feel, experience while they are being cared by you. Prepare them for what they might have to see/hear/experience. What would YOU want to know if this was your first time experiencing what they are? They don’t know what they can do with their baby they don’t know if they can dress them or hold them or how long they get with their baby. They don’t know if they can ask for them to come back if they go to the morgue. 

My midwives could have helped more by just upping the communication a bit more. They didn’t ask for my preferences for the birth and I hadn’t thought about that before, my baby was stillborn and he was just dropped straight onto my bare abdomen at birth like any healthy baby would be and it was horrifying and I still have PTSD from that moment 3 years later. I wish I’d been offered the chance to have him wrapped up nicely and looking sweetly sleeping before meeting him rather than him dropped sprawling and the deadest thing I’ve ever seen on my skin. It makes me cry to remember. No one should have to meet their baby that way. 

It might sound strange but we have our heads totally up our butts when this happens to us. We don’t know what we will need for our grief until we are looking back and it’s too late to fix it so it’s quite important that the people caring for us know what to suggest to us. Offer to take lots of photos. Of every part of the baby. They can not look at photos if they choose but wanting to know the precise shape of your child’s nostril when you wake in a panic at 2am 4 months after their funeral and not having a picture to find that information out is heartbreaking.  You can give them that and it makes a huge difference. Get them super clear nice prints of the hands and feet, and take multiple. Honestly when it comes to keepsakes they can’t ever have enough. Offer to let them keep anything and everything for a memory box. I kept the nozzle from my gas and air pain relief during labour. I kept the clothing he wore. I kept my hospital bands and they kindly gave us baby ones and wrote them up like any live birth would have.

Treating my baby like any other baby was something I appreciated hugely. The nurses spoke to him as they handled him and said how beautiful he was. It made me so proud as his mummy like any new mother. Congratulate them on their beautiful child, they probably won’t hear that from anyone else. 

Another big thing is to never try to make things better or see a bright side to things or a silver lining. No “at least” statements like at least you still have one at home or at least you can try again. No religious sentiments unless the parents lead this first. Not everyone is religious, I personally am an atheist and do not believe my son is in heaven nor do I believe in an afterlife so hearing people talk about God and heaven was quite triggering in my grief. Even people who are religious often hate to hear “god needed another angel” type of things as they are struggling to consolidate their loss and their faith in their heads. 

I will say that I appreciated seeing the midwives show emotion for our loss - it showed they knew he mattered and that his life was important and our loss was important. I would never ever think less of any nurse who cried at a bereaved birth. I’d thank them for sharing in that grief for that loved and lost child. It’s mostly professionals who haven’t experienced loss who are horrified at the idea of a fellow professional shedding a tear instead of keeping it together. There’s a line to this of course, the parents should never feel like they are comforting you but being with them in a moment is fine and is lovely.

Life is... harder? It's sadder - my birthday was sadder, this holiday season is weighing so heavily on my heart.  People expect you to go back to ""normal"", which is just never ever gonna happen. Because this is my normal now.  I am always a little bit sad, even when I am happy.  I'm coming to terms with it now, the fact that I will never feel joy the same way I used to.  That there will always and forever be a part of my heart missing. But I feel softer, kinder. Less judgmental, more open with my feelings and telling people I love them and being in the moment. Because I know how fast it can all change.  


Sometimes loss tears people apart - significant others, especially.  It didn't for us. It brought us closer. We had a rush wedding after our loss - less than 2 months to plan and it was wonderful, but we just knew after we lost Declan, we knew that if we had each other we would make it. We both made it very clear that we couldn't lose the other.  Some of my friendships are strained, one is gone completely. One of my best friends ended up pregnant a month after our loss, so that has been a struggle too.  My parents don't quite understand, but they are trying.  My sister and my mother-in-law are the only people who really talk to me about Declan. Who say his name and tell me they miss him and are sad.  I know it's true of other people, but the silence hurts my heart.

Maybe a week before everything bad started, we had painted the room. We put up a decal that said ""Love you to the moon and back"". We assembled his crib.

We haven't disassembled anything, mostly because we are hopeful that one day we will get to use it as a nursery for real.

My bad...

&#x200B;

My loss has a few factors so I will try to be as thorough as possible.

My pregnancy was easy, until it wasn't - like so many other people's.  I had normal ultrasounds, a normal anatomy scan at 18 weeks (where my cervix measured 5cm's long - this is important later).

When I was 21 weeks 5 days I was having some dull cramping pains.  I was a first time mom, and assumed it was ligament pain or braxton hicks. It went on for a whole day, but it was never painful. On December 10th I woke up and went to the bathroom and when I wiped there was a BIG glob of pink mucous. And I was still having the cramping sensation.  I was scared, and I told my fiance - we called the local health link and they advised we go in to the Labour and Delivery, just to be safe.

So we did - and we got checked in, monitored, and then an intern came to talk to us - He suggested it was probably just ligament pains mixed with dehydration but he would get the resident to come and check me out.  We were so relieved, joking around, when she came in and asked to do an internal exam. ""Yeah, no worries, check it out!"" and then the whole mood changed.  She did an internal exam and I saw her face drop.  I was 3cm's dilated, and my cervix was almost completely gone.  She informed me that I would need to be checked out by the on call OBGYN and see what options we had.

Once we talked to her we were given three options.

1. To terminate
2. To wait for my body to inevitably miscarry
3. Perform a procedure called a rescue cerclage, to stitch up my cervix and try to give my son a fighting chance to get to viability.  At 22 weeks, he was too little for any kind of intervention if he came.  If we could get to 24 weeks we would have a shot.

Of course my fiance and I decided to try the cerclage. And so I went in for surgery, which turned out to be a tentative success.

I was released from the hospital the next day and put on strict bed rest at home. Only horizontal, except to pee and shower.  I spent the next 2 weeks like this, with a few more trips to L&D for contractions again.  One of those days was December 22nd - we spent the morning in the hospital, and the resident decided to not check me internally. He said if anything was happening it wouldn't make a difference if he checked or not.  We were sent home, and I was told to rest and drink water - come back if I see any blood.

That night, around 11pm I went to the bathroom and there was some blood. And so off we went (for the last time) to L&D - by the time I got there I was in real labour, and it couldn't be stopped.  At 2:05 am on December 23rd my son was born.  I didn't know at the time, but he was non responsive when he was born - they took him away and started life saving measures, taking my fiance with them.  He was asked what we wanted to do, as if either of us had a fucking clue - but thankfully they found a heartbeat.  It took hours to stabilize him, and finally we were transferred to the NICU.

The next day and half feel like years and minutes all at the same time.  I was pumping breastmilk, we stayed at the hospital until 7ish that night.  We only went home to sleep and eat.  The next morning, at 5:20, I was pumping more milk when I got the phone call.  Declan had taken a turn and they wanted us to come in as soon as possible - My fiance asked what it was about and I told him, but said we had time and he could shower.  Thankfully, he was not in shock so he took us right away.

When we got there we were told he had had some brain bleeds, and that is lungs had taken a bad turn.  We were given a 50/50 shot of things changing but I think we knew in our hearts.  And so we stayed with him until they couldn't do anything else except keep his pain at bay.

I held him, skin to skin on my chest while he passed. We told him all of the dreams we had for him - Disneyland and hockey and all the trouble he would have gotten in with our dog. We tried to fill a lifetime of love into 20 minutes.  I held him until he turn cold in my arms and I just couldn't be there anymore.

I remember a social worker gave us so many papers, and our families were there in the waiting room. Mostly I remember having to hold myself up against the walls to get out of the hospital.  To leave there with empty arms was devastating.  I also remember being so angry at how blue the sky was because how dare it be a nice day outside.

Our son only lived for 36 hours but he changed who I am forever. We lost him last Christmas Eve.

My fiance (now husband) had the same kind of reaction to pregnancy to most men. He was excited, but it doesn't feel quite as ""real"" when you aren't the one who is pregnant. I think because Declan was alive for a short time, as soon as he was born the fatherhood really hit him. We have grieved together, especially in the first weeks, and then grieved apart - I'm much more emotional and he is more stoic. He took 2 months off of work after our loss. Neither of us could function enough to live outside of our home.  He was also ready to try again before I was - but I've blamed myself a lot for our loss thank to the ultimate diagnosis being ""incompetent cervix"". He has never blamed me, so I think I've struggled on a different level than he did.

&#x200B;

Medically I think we were handled very well, minus the L&D resident who didn't check me the morning that he was born. Part of me thinks that had he checked me we could have stopped labour for another couple of weeks, or at the very least gotten steroid shots for his lungs.  But that's a ""what-if"" rabbit hole that I just can't go down.  Thankfully I'm in Canada, so it hasn't been a financial burden for us either.

&#x200B;

As for other loss communities - I have a few I am in on facebook, more specialized ones to deal with the incompetent cervix loss and I am very publicly grieving on instagram. No use being fake over there for me. And there are lots of wonderful supports out there.  I also am part of an in person support group in my local town and it has helped immensely.  Honestly, most people still don't feel real to me anymore - I can only truly express how sad I am with other people who know what loss is. Finding support like this has been the best thing to happen to my grief. I don't know where I would be without all the loss communities - when I feel weak they are my strength and on days I feel strong I try to pass it on to others.

&#x200B;

I don't compare my loss to other losses, because there is no point in grief Olympics. We have all lost children, regardless of gestation or circumstance. Do I connect with people who have a loss more similar to mine? Yes. But that doesn't mean that I think mine is better or worse than anyone else's. I hope that makes sense.

&#x200B;",[],,t1_eb3ah8t,False,0,[],False,"<div class=""md""><p>EDIT: this is in 2 comments because it ended up being too long.. My bad...</p>

<p>&#x200B;</p>

<p>My loss has a few factors so I will try to be as thorough as possible.</p>

<p>My pregnancy was easy, until it wasn&#39;t - like so many other people&#39;s.  I had normal ultrasounds, a normal anatomy scan at 18 weeks (where my cervix measured 5cm&#39;s long - this is important later).</p>

<p>When I was 21 weeks 5 days I was having some dull cramping pains.  I was a first time mom, and assumed it was ligament pain or braxton hicks. It went on for a whole day, but it was never painful. On December 10th I woke up and went to the bathroom and when I wiped there was a BIG glob of pink mucous. And I was still having the cramping sensation.  I was scared, and I told my fiance - we called the local health link and they advised we go in to the Labour and Delivery, just to be safe.</p>

<p>So we did - and we got checked in, monitored, and then an intern came to talk to us - He suggested it was probably just ligament pains mixed with dehydration but he would get the resident to come and check me out.  We were so relieved, joking around, when she came in and asked to do an internal exam. &quot;Yeah, no worries, check it out!&quot; and then the whole mood changed.  She did an internal exam and I saw her face drop.  I was 3cm&#39;s dilated, and my cervix was almost completely gone.  She informed me that I would need to be checked out by the on call OBGYN and see what options we had.</p>

<p>Once we talked to her we were given three options.</p>

<ol>
<li>To terminate</li>
<li>To wait for my body to inevitably miscarry</li>
<li>Perform a procedure called a rescue cerclage, to stitch up my cervix and try to give my son a fighting chance to get to viability.  At 22 weeks, he was too little for any kind of intervention if he came.  If we could get to 24 weeks we would have a shot.</li>
</ol>

<p>Of course my fiance and I decided to try the cerclage. And so I went in for surgery, which turned out to be a tentative success.</p>

<p>I was released from the hospital the next day and put on strict bed rest at home. Only horizontal, except to pee and shower.  I spent the next 2 weeks like this, with a few more trips to L&amp;D for contractions again.  One of those days was December 22nd - we spent the morning in the hospital, and the resident decided to not check me internally. He said if anything was happening it wouldn&#39;t make a difference if he checked or not.  We were sent home, and I was told to rest and drink water - come back if I see any blood.</p>

<p>That night, around 11pm I went to the bathroom and there was some blood. And so off we went (for the last time) to L&amp;D - by the time I got there I was in real labour, and it couldn&#39;t be stopped.  At 2:05 am on December 23rd my son was born.  I didn&#39;t know at the time, but he was non responsive when he was born - they took him away and started life saving measures, taking my fiance with them.  He was asked what we wanted to do, as if either of us had a fucking clue - but thankfully they found a heartbeat.  It took hours to stabilize him, and finally we were transferred to the NICU.</p>

<p>The next day and half feel like years and minutes all at the same time.  I was pumping breastmilk, we stayed at the hospital until 7ish that night.  We only went home to sleep and eat.  The next morning, at 5:20, I was pumping more milk when I got the phone call.  Declan had taken a turn and they wanted us to come in as soon as possible - My fiance asked what it was about and I told him, but said we had time and he could shower.  Thankfully, he was not in shock so he took us right away.</p>

<p>When we got there we were told he had had some brain bleeds, and that is lungs had taken a bad turn.  We were given a 50/50 shot of things changing but I think we knew in our hearts.  And so we stayed with him until they couldn&#39;t do anything else except keep his pain at bay.</p>

<p>I held him, skin to skin on my chest while he passed. We told him all of the dreams we had for him - Disneyland and hockey and all the trouble he would have gotten in with our dog. We tried to fill a lifetime of love into 20 minutes.  I held him until he turn cold in my arms and I just couldn&#39;t be there anymore.</p>

<p>I remember a social worker gave us so many papers, and our families were there in the waiting room. Mostly I remember having to hold myself up against the walls to get out of the hospital.  To leave there with empty arms was devastating.  I also remember being so angry at how blue the sky was because how dare it be a nice day outside.</p>

She also made it sound like I would have to send my son’s body to the morgue the next morning because I couldn’t have it stay in my room due to inevitable decomposition.

1. This may not be appropriate based on the situation, but I know as a first time mom, it kills me that only one person ever said “Congratulations on your baby and becoming a mom.” It was a nurse - not my husband, family, doctors...just a nurse I can’t even remember the name of. It meant the world to me to hear it. 

2. Close. The. Door. When you enter a room. Or when someone else enters and doesn’t shut it. Being on the L&D floor for five days, I cannot count the times I heard others babies crying in the halls and it just rubbed salt in an open wound. Muffling the noise helped. 

3. Pleas do not comment on the woman’s leg hair or *ahem* other areas. I know this is probably common knowledge but as someone who was so tired and sick in the weeks before giving birth, I was mortified during my hospital stay. If anyone had even mentioned it in passing or made a joke I would have hoped the preeclampsia would come back and take me. Thank god the staff were compassionate and didn’t say a word, but I know others haven’t been as fortunate. 

All in all, just show that you care and offer to hold hands, give hugs, ask questions. The demeanor of the medical staff can make losses so much worse, or easier, depending on your actions.

I think a book that has real example and real feelings would be nice. I see miscarriages and pregnancy loss in the media and its usually very unrealistic which is just so irritating to me.

Anyway.

So, I've had two losses. The first wasn't that upsetting. It was early (5 weeks) and I had only just found out I was pregnant. I was married, but not trying to get pregnant. I was not unhappy, but we weren't really thinking of having kids yet and my husband was out of town (he is in the military) when I found out and when I lost it. While I wasn't exactly devastated, it was sad, and it started our conversation on when we wanted to start trying.

So, January comes around and we start trying on my husband's birthday. I found out I was pregnant on February 3rd. And I'll never forget it. I was so happy. I had been feeling off for days but had gotten a negative pregnancy test so I was trying to wait until my missed period. February 3rd was the day my period was due and at 4 am I ended up taking a digital test because I couldn't sleep. It was positive. I woke up my husband and he was so half asleep he said ""congratulations"". We were so excited though. As soon as I got a positive blood test, he couldn't wait to tell his family.

We called the OB, but they wouldn't see us until 10 weeks. I was nervous about something being wrong because I wasn't feeling very sick, but I had all the other symptoms. At 6 weeks, I started spotting. Everyone said it was normal, so I just kind of ignored it. At 7 weeks, it turned into light bleeding, but still brown. I called my OB who told me it was normal. At 9 weeks, I was STILL bleeding. Finally, one night I had a total breakdown about it and my husband took me to the ER. They didn't have an ultrasound, so they did other tests on me until the ultrasound guy came in the morning. My HCG was 50,000 and everything looked good. I was borderline anemic, but that's not unusual for me even though I was taking iron.

I was having some pelvic pain which is why they wanted to do an ultrasound (in case of ectopic) since I was right around when they start to be very dangerous.

Morning comes and they give me an abdominal ultrasound. I knew it was over when they told me they'd have to do a transvaginal. My husband asked if he could look at the ultrasound, but I knew there wouldn't be anything to see. The morning ER doctor who was very heavily pregnant came in to tell me that I was having a blighted ovum. She said there was nothing there but an empty sac and then left.

My OB finally saw me the next day and it turns out the ER doctor had lied. The baby was measuring 6 weeks. It wasn't a blighted ovum. It was a missed miscarriage. My OB scheduled another ultrasound for a week later to make sure and took some swabs to test for VB just in case.

I miscarried a couple days later and ended up in the ER again because I was losing so much blood. It turned out that my cervix was clogged with tissue and was pushing so hard to get it out which is why I was bleeding so much. The ER helped pull it out and gave me Misoprostal and Narco to take at home. I stopped bleeding buckets pretty much immediately after they cleared my cervix.

Ultrasound showed I was clean a few days later and we started trying again a couple months later. I have been unable to get pregnant since. My last loss was in March of 2017.

It was hard. I was numb for a long time. I remember coming home from the OB when they told me about it being a missed miscarriage and sobbing in the shower. My mom kept trying to tell me that there was still hope and I kept waffling between there is no hope and what if they're wrong. It was so hard not knowing for sure. 

When I finally started to miscarry... It was partially a relief. Now I knew there was nothing I could do.

It was hard on my husband as well, but he doesn't talk to me about it. I know that he has been trying to keep it together for me. He was really upset when I was bleeding everywhere and in a lot of pain. I think he thought I was going to die.

I wish that my OB had seen me earlier. I know there's nothing to be done now, but I had been spotting and bleeding for several weeks (around he time that growth stopped). Maybe they couldn't have helped, but at least I would have known a few weeks earlier instead of thinking nothing was wrong that whole time.

I haven't joined any other support groups and sometimes I think about it. I still have a really hard time with my losses, mostly because I have now been diagnosed with unexplained infertility. I might never get pregnant again. Those could have been my only chances. There's a lot of regret. Why didn't I push harder to get seen. I knew a lot of women were getting seen as early as 6 weeks.

I do compare my losses to other ones sometimes. But the motto here is that a loss is a loss. They all hurt. My second loss hurt much more but it was mostly because we had been trying to get pregnant that time.

Being in this community helps me to see that I am not alone in my experience, but the longer I go without getting pregnant again, the less I relate to the people here.

It is hard to see people around me get pregnant so easily when it is all I've wanted for almost two years now. It's made me into a really bitter person and I honestly hate it. And now I just see people announcing at 6 weeks and can't understand it. How can you be thar confident that you'll end up with a baby. I want to just rub their faces in it, but I know that would be wrong.

My relationship with my husband is strained because he won't talk to me about any of it. And some of my friendships have ended.

I have cut all ties to my grandmother (maternal) because she has put the blame on me. She said it was God punishing me for my views on abortion. My father agreed and I am in the process of cutting him and his family off from my life as well.

I had a miscarriage 3 weeks ago and I was starting to feel a bit better. But last night I had the most horrible dreams. Basically just dreams of what I went through all over again, of never being able to have a family, of my husband heartbroken and leaving me. Obviously I know that will never happen, he’s the kindest person I know and has been so sweet to me. 

I just kind of woke up in a bad spot. Really sad, really mad and just not wanting to do anything. So I called in to work and they too are way too understanding. They said not to worry and just to take a day. I’m super thankful for them. 

My SIL is pregnant with her second child, which I’m super excited and happy for her. But I’m also really sad for us. It’s hard to be around his family. Every time were with them they remind us that she’s pregnant, which trust me we know. Then she’ll complain about not being able to consume alcohol on Christmas Day, which I would give up alcohol forever if it meant I could have a baby. She also makes parenting look super difficult at times, which fair enough it probably is, but her daughter is so sweet and is just a kid. Of course she’s going to be loud in a restaurant and not wanting to sit still, she’s only 3. 

Then on Facebook you got people announcing there pregnancies, or announcing the births of there babies. And I used to love reading those and being envious of them and hoping that one day I’ll be like them. But now I’m just sad and worried that will never be me.

",[],,t1_eb2jqu1,False,0,[],False,"<div class=""md""><p>Last night I had the worst sleep in weeks. I had a miscarriage 3 weeks ago and I was starting to feel a bit better. But last night I had the most horrible dreams. Basically just dreams of what I went through all over again, of never being able to have a family, of my husband heartbroken and leaving me. Obviously I know that will never happen, he’s the kindest person I know and has been so sweet to me. </p>

<p>I just kind of woke up in a bad spot. Really sad, really mad and just not wanting to do anything. So I called in to work and they too are way too understanding. They said not to worry and just to take a day. I’m super thankful for them. </p>

<p>My SIL is pregnant with her second child, which I’m super excited and happy for her. But I’m also really sad for us. It’s hard to be around his family. Every time were with them they remind us that she’s pregnant, which trust me we know. Then she’ll complain about not being able to consume alcohol on Christmas Day, which I would give up alcohol forever if it meant I could have a baby. She also makes parenting look super difficult at times, which fair enough it probably is, but her daughter is so sweet and is just a kid. Of course she’s going to be loud in a restaurant and not wanting to sit still, she’s only 3. </p>

<p>Then on Facebook you got people announcing there pregnancies, or announcing the births of there babies. And I used to love reading those and being envious of them and hoping that one day I’ll be like them. But now I’m just sad and worried that will never be me. Also how am I supposed to get excited the next time we fond out we’re expecting. I’m going to be a nervous wreck. </p>

<p>Sorry about the rant, I guess I didn’t realize I had that much to say. Feels good to put it al into words and share it with someone other then my husband. Going to go have my hot chocolate and continue re reading the Harry Potter series. </p>

\-You can check your thyroid level.  It is a fast, easy, and inexpensive test, so I would do it to rule that out quickly.

\-You can try taking baby aspirin.  My doctor told me it can help fluff up the uterine lining to help implantation.  I am not sure if it works.  (I still had a miscarriage after trying this).  But at least it's cheap and relatively easy.

\-You can have your doctor check your progesterone level or ask him/her to prescribe progesterone that you take once you have confirmed ovulation.  This is another thing I tried and it didn't work for me so far...but again, it's pretty easy and not TOO expensive (pills were like $60).

\-Also, I haven't tried this yet, but I remember reading somewhere that very early losses are most often caused by issues with the uterus.  Like fibroids, septum, etc.  I am going to be asking to get this checked next.  

\-You may want to have you and your partner tested for karyotyping.  This will tell if either of you have a balance translocation issue, which can lead to repeated early losses.

We had to get three amnioscenteses done because the first two failed. We got the results the day before my termination appointment. I had to go to a clinic out of state because none in my area could get us in before the cutoff. It was horrendous but taught me a lot and I’ve grown so much as a person because of it. It’s been a journey, and I promise it will get better for you too in time. The pain doesn’t go away, but it does get easier to manage.</p>

Sorry about your Dr. :( I think Drs often get desensitized because they deal with so much every day and these things become routine to them. They should be aware of that and make special efforts (and I'm sure most of them do), but they are human too. 

It is very comforting to talk to others who can really relate. I'm so glad to have these online communities, although I wish this wasn't so common. 

I had told some closer family members and friends about my pregnancy so I have had their support thru this as well. Although I do regret telling my MIL. She  has not been supportive to us at all and I actually got into a bit of an argument with her. :( But everyone else has been amazingly supportive. 

Good luck on your Dr search. I find the midwifery model of care much more compassionate. I was looking into a birthing center with a midwife. Something like that might be a nicer option for you, if you are near one. They seem much more sensitive and caring.

Today is the first day I haven't cried (yet), and I'm feeling much better. My eyes were in so much pain yesterday by the end of the day. I kept almost tearing up but no tears would come out. 

I can't imagine how much worse it is for mamas who are farther along. 💔 I know it is so cliche and not everyone wants to hear it, but my mom always said to count your blessings. I grew up in church and there was a song that said count your blessings name them one by one, count your blessings see what God has done.

I did speak with my midwife and she didn't recommend any testing. She did say a lot of women get pregnant the very next cycle. She also said I did not need to wait at all to try again, and that it's totally up to me and how I'm feeling. She said if I'm bleeding more than 7-10 days we will need to do some testing. It's really slowing down today and yesterday so I hope it's over soon. I think this has been the worst part for me.  :(

I also read online that some studies indicate you may be more fertile in the 2 months following a MC. I find that very exciting. 

I'm considering following up with my GP, to see if he would recommend any testing. 

I'm also considering hormone testing when I do become pregnant again. 

But I'm also thinking I might like to give my body another chance naturally and without testing. I was so relaxed last time and enjoyed not worrying about tests and Drs. Idk. There's still a lot going on in my mind obviously.

I feel like I want to try again right away. But I have decided to wait until I test 0 HCG because I don't want to take any chances of a false pregnancy test. 

I'm going to be seeing my hypnobirthing educator next week and we are going to do a special grieving/loss hypnosis/meditation session. I had seen her before I conceived for a fertility session. Honestly this is just deep guided super relaxation and it is amazing. I highly recommend it, it's all I've been thinking about for outside coping strategies.

<p>Maybe we will be due date buddies in the future! 🌈</p>

<p>I did speak with my midwife and she didn&#39;t recommend any testing. She did say a lot of women get pregnant the very next cycle. She also said I did not need to wait at all to try again, and that it&#39;s totally up to me and how I&#39;m feeling. She said if I&#39;m bleeding more than 7-10 days we will need to do some testing. It&#39;s really slowing down today and yesterday so I hope it&#39;s over soon. I think this has been the worst part for me.  :(</p>

<p>I also read online that some studies indicate you may be more fertile in the 2 months following a MC. I find that very exciting. </p>

<p>I&#39;m considering following up with my GP, to see if he would recommend any testing. </p>

<p>I&#39;m also considering hormone testing when I do become pregnant again. </p>

<p>But I&#39;m also thinking I might like to give my body another chance naturally and without testing. I was so relaxed last time and enjoyed not worrying about tests and Drs. Idk. There&#39;s still a lot going on in my mind obviously.</p>

The nurse told me she'd notify my doctor and I'd hear back. I waited about an hour and decided to go to the ER since I clearly wasn't that important to them. They told me at the ER I had some retained tissue and that my HCG was over 350.

The ER told me they would fax over my information for that visit to office I go to. The office didn't bother to call me for a week and when they did, the nurse tried to tell me I am probably just having a heavy period which is common post-MC. Clearly nobody read the information from my visit to the ER or understood that I hadn't stopped bleeding. When I told the nurse that this is not my PERIOD and that I had told her that when we talked a week ago, she just responds with ""Oh. I'll let Dr. K know and you should hear back in a few days"".

I work customer service and always try to remain as professional as possible but what she was telling me absolutely unacceptable. I ended up speaking to the practice manager the following day who was condescending towards me. She tried to tell me that my ultrasound report had no mention of retained fetal tissue and treated me like I was pitching a fit over nothing. I read the report on my patient portal online, it doesn't say fetal tissue-she's right. It does how ever mention retained products of conception. They tried to schedule me to come in this week (which would have been about three weeks out at the time). I told her no, I am not ok with that and am very concerned about getting a uterine infection. I was able to be seen sooner. Literally all the did was give me a urine test and tell me because it's now negative that I shouldn't be concerned since my HCG has clearly dropped. They did saw if I am ""that concerned"" I can always come in for a follow up. Obviously I declined.

I am now bleeding almost 7 weeks post MC and have an appointment scheduled with a new ObGyn clinic. I am already a lot happier with what I've seen with them. When I called last week to schedule an appointment, they made sure I spoke with a nurse immediately. The nurse was able to access all my ER visits while I was on the phone. Overall, I felt like they were much more on the ball than the other clinic.

<p>I work customer service and always try to remain as professional as possible but what she was telling me absolutely unacceptable. I ended up speaking to the practice manager the following day who was condescending towards me. She tried to tell me that my ultrasound report had no mention of retained fetal tissue and treated me like I was pitching a fit over nothing. I read the report on my patient portal online, it doesn&#39;t say fetal tissue-she&#39;s right. It does how ever mention retained products of conception. They tried to schedule me to come in this week (which would have been about three weeks out at the time). I told her no, I am not ok with that and am very concerned about getting a uterine infection. I was able to be seen sooner. Literally all the did was give me a urine test and tell me because it&#39;s now negative that I shouldn&#39;t be concerned since my HCG has clearly dropped. They did saw if I am &quot;that concerned&quot; I can always come in for a follow up. Obviously I declined.</p>

<p>I am now bleeding almost 7 weeks post MC and have an appointment scheduled with a new ObGyn clinic. I am already a lot happier with what I&#39;ve seen with them. When I called last week to schedule an appointment, they made sure I spoke with a nurse immediately. The nurse was able to access all my ER visits while I was on the phone. Overall, I felt like they were much more on the ball than the other clinic. </p>

I must admit, all I want right now is to erase all of this and wish it isn’t happening.

I know I will want to see him and acknowledge him, but all I want right now is to forget everything. But I know no one else will ever see his beautiful face and remember it and then he’s gone forever so I’ve gotta do it. But fuck, it’s hard.

I guess I’m just looking for a bit of reassurance or something right now. (This waiting game sucks) anything that makes me feel less like an observer I guess. 

I’m feeling a bit like a loose dag right now.

Fuck it.

Before I left the hospital I had a health check and everything was as it should be considering I'd given birth the day before.

Before we left the hospital, I had a vaginal ultrasound and a check up to make sure everything was as it should be and I have another appointment next week. When we left the hospital the doctor gave us a small slip of paper with dangerous symptoms to look out for and what to expect during the recovering. It was that piece of paper that said wait 6 months. I presume they give the information to everyone who gives birth. I can imagine waiting 6 months after a full term birth is pretty standard as there is a lot of other stuff that can go on down there, including caring for a baby. 

Medical care is so different to what I'm used to in Japan and things take a lot longer. After giving birth usually a hospital stay is a week long, and 10 days or more for a C-section. In the UK it seems mum can leave with baby the next day. During my pregnancy I wasn't allowed to take any medicine and I wasn't prescribed any vitamins. I had pretty awful heartburn and back ache at one point which they didn't prescribe me anything for, even though I know they would have done at home. Also, it's extremely rare for hospitals to provide pain relief during the birth - I had to sign a piece of paper to say I understood and I wouldn't ask for pain relief. All of that along with waiting to try again is the 'Japanese way' I think. It's just different here.

I don’t think how you’re feeling right now is selfish at all - you’ve just gone through one of the worst experiences ever and you should take the time to deal with that however you need to. It’s difficult for friends and family who haven’t been through it themselves to really understand. Personally I found it helpful to be honest with mine - at my lowest point, I told them I felt like I had been completely overcome by grief, which I had been. Most offered their support but also backed off a little - no one was hurt. I think they all just felt a little helpless. 

The milestones are terrible - Thursday was the day I would have progressed one week with my pregnancy, and also happened to be the day that I delivered my daughter, at 20 weeks. Now a Thursday doesn’t pass where I’m not counting - where before it was towards my due date, now it’s always x weeks since our loss.  I do find each week gets a little easier though, and I hope that you eventually find the same ❤️

Regarding how long you need to wait to ttc, that’s interesting that they say 6 months - do they have a reason for that? My doctor said 6 weeks - so one cycle, and I think even that was just for dating purposes. (It was a 20 week loss for trisomy 18, induced labour) She also reminded me of course that it all depends on when you are emotionally ready to try again. But physically there wasn’t a reason to wait. I’ve seen some on here that have been advised to wait longer though, so I think it all depends on the circumstances of your loss. Maybe you could ask the doctors there for some more details about their advice?

My “best friend” since 11 years old... it’s been rough for a few years with her. I can’t seem to cut her out, but she brings nothing to the table and hasn’t for at least 6 years.

I’ll be honest, I had not shared that I was pregnant in the first place, but I had posted a very pointed message about grief on social media. It was strong enough that even a parent from one of my students from several years ago privately messaged me.

Fuck that. Friends that don’t care enough to check on you when you’re clearly crying out for help don’t deserve to know anything.

CD10, WTO. I’m supposed to go to my husband’s Thanksgiving tomorrow, but I’m not sure if I want to tempt fate (which he says I like to do). He can’t come because of work, so it’d be just me among all of his super religious and straight laced aunts, uncles, and cousins, four of whom have gotten married in the last 2 years. I’m surprised no one’s pregnant yet honestly, hence why I’m scared to go.

They want me to bring my wedding album (we didn’t invite any of them to the wedding), plus I have gifts for the two couples who got married this summer. If there were to be an announcement, I have a feeling I’d come down with a severe case of diarrhea aka crying in the bathroom and I’d have to leave.

<p>CD10, WTO. I’m supposed to go to my husband’s Thanksgiving tomorrow, but I’m not sure if I want to tempt fate (which he says I like to do). He can’t come because of work, so it’d be just me among all of his super religious and straight laced aunts, uncles, and cousins, four of whom have gotten married in the last 2 years. I’m surprised no one’s pregnant yet honestly, hence why I’m scared to go.</p>

<p>They want me to bring my wedding album (we didn’t invite any of them to the wedding), plus I have gifts for the two couples who got married this summer. If there were to be an announcement, I have a feeling I’d come down with a severe case of diarrhea aka crying in the bathroom and I’d have to leave.

<p>I’m sorry about your losses but please, Read the room.</p>

Not exactly like scar tissue...I can't remember what it's called).  As soon as the tissue was passed, the spotting stopped (the next day, I think).

I think TFAB can be overwhelming and for some reason the ladies in this group just seem to get me, and be more rationale/level-headed. Props to y'all.

I also got pregnant cycle 1 of TTC and miscarried at 6+1. You're allowed to feel ALL of the emotions whenever and however you want. I also had very supportive colleagues (my boss had 3 MC and has 4 LC) which was immensely helpful. I didn't take time off work, which was likely a mistake, so good for your boss to get your booty home to allow yourself to grieve. 

We also told immediate family and close friends. I felt that lump of embarrassment in my throat at first but now I'm like oh hell no, I need the support and whatever they are feeling they can just keep to themselves/each other if it's not helpful for me/my hubs. My MIL gets in from England tonight to celebrate her first Thanksgiving with us and I am nervous AF that all she is going to do is talk about this. I've basically cocooned myself in my apartment on my couch since it happened, so Thanksgiving is going to be the first time I have to see family in person and I don't know how I am going to deal with it. 

Sending support, virtual hugs and strength.

<p>I hope your Thanksgiving is as good as it can be in light of your loss and I’m so very sorry. </p>

I&#39;ll test again tomorrow, but hpts seem to be supporting the assumption that my hCG IS going down.  this is the first and only spotting I&#39;ve had since the bleeding stopped, a few days after my second miso dose in mid-October.</p>

<p>&#x200B;</p>

<p>So, the acupuncture / Eastern medicine explanation is that I had some undetected retained tissue that the acupuncture treatment is clearing, resulting in a (faster?) hCG decrease.  My open-but-skeptical self wonders - if THAT&#39;s not it, or not entirely it, what IS this spotting?  I definitely haven&#39;t ovulated, obv, and it doesn&#39;t (really?) feel like the beginning of a period.  curious. </p>

For me, they haven't gone away (and I don't think they ever will). Things did get easier once I was able to picture bringing this baby home, which happened gradually. Passing my due date did relieve the ""I should be X weeks now"" thoughts, but now I have the ""My son should be X months old"" thoughts instead. Those are a little less tangible, though. But I still think about how I should have had a baby on my summer trip, how for Thanksgiving I should have a baby who's just started solid foods, etc. I think about the possible world in which my son didn't die and wonder what it's like there. Even happy milestones in this pregnancy (kicks, hiccups, baby shower) make me think ""But I should have had this with Martin!"" I think people who haven't lost babies assume that being pregnant again instantly makes everything better. 


For the record, I still resent women with big bellies. And I am one! Whenever I see a big belly, I roll my eyes and think that of COURSE she gets her happy, healthy pregnancy and her take-home baby. And I have to remind myself that I don't know her story, and maybe she's terrified every minute. Sometimes I'm tempted to wear a sign saying that I suffered for this.

And I HATED my no-longer-pregnant body too. It felt so empty and worthless. I always had this idea that pregnancy would make me love my body because I would feel so powerful that I could grow another human. And then my body killed my baby. It's doing a better job growing this baby, but I still resent it for having such a shitty record.

So in conclusion, I'm 34 weeks pregnant, baby is doing great, and I frequently still feel like a bitter, sad bitch.",[],,t1_ea2qzlk,False,0,[],False,"<div class=""md""><p>Those are great, difficult questions.</p>

I&#39;ve been feeling like this is NEVER going to end, and this was such a huge positive. vacillating about asking my gyno to run another beta - tracking down to zero is not her standard protocol, but it would be nice to quantify the decrease. More acupuncture on wednesday, can&#39;t wait. </p>

I just want to say that I don’t think you should think of consideration of your toddler’s future life as an excuse. I think you were being a good mom.

We got a T21 diagnosis at 25 weeks, and were told that there was a range of how severe impacts could be, but even in the best case scenario, which is rare, the outlook was rough. I just kept thinking about what having this child would mean for my toddler. What if both my husband and I died at some point, would my son then have to face the decision of completely changing whatever his current lifestyle was to take care of his brother or to put him in an assisted living facility? And hundreds of other scenarios. What if it was one of the more severe scenarios? Would my son spend loads of time in the hospital because his brother needed surgery and care? Or would he just see his parents way less often because we were always at appointments? There’s no right or wrong answer when you’re faced with a situation like that, just what you think will ultimately be best for you and your family.

You also saved your baby from constant surgeries, pain, and trips to the hospital. All she ever knew was love, warmth and safety, and the beating of your heart. 

As for where you’re at right now, my cycles were pretty weird after my TFMR. They ranged from 25-35 days with no discernible pattern. Apparently it’s normal for your cycle to be a little wonky after something like that. And, I totally get your desire to start TTC again as soon as possible.

TW: Current pregnancy
I was both afraid to get pregnant and also of not getting pregnant.  That had been my first and it had been uneventful up to that point. I did get pregnant again the next year, but had a MMC at 8 weeks or so, even after seeing the heartbeat.  Then I started to really freak out because I felt like I kept falling on the wrong side of the odds, even though they should have been in my favor.  I got pregnant again this year, and was also diagnosed with a miscarriage - which turned out to be a mistake (another long story).  That is the same pregnancy I currently have and I’m finally at the end now, but echos of my first are reverberating now through my soul, in addition to still questioning if I will actually take home a live baby still.

It’s a long road of healing, and there are, no doubt, ups and downs forever.  In glad this community is here to support.  Please PM if you need anything...

Lots of 💕
