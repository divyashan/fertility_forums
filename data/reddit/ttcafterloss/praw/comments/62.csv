As for TTC, I think temping alone can be finicky for some women, but I wouldn't say it's a waste of time.   Natural family planning (NFP), which incorporates monitoring CM, sometimes OPKs, can be extremely effective when TTCing--definitely better than temping alone. I think the best performance comes from situations where couples are properly trained and receiving ongoing guidance from professionals for the first few months of the learning curve.  

The fact is, though, that not all women get their O-date right, and because of that, OBs are always going to go off of LMP, updated by size at the ultrasound, no matter how conscientious a woman is and how sure of her dates she is.  If the embryo is measuring small, they're still going to recommend rescanning after a week or two to rule out late ovulation.  These are just the protocols the system has in place to minimize any mistakes.  

It doesn't mean your doctor has to be dismissive and patronizing, though.  PAL can be an anxious experience even without symptoms of something going wrong, and having a doctor who is supportive and takes your challenges seriously (as much as your insurance will allow him/her to accommodate you) makes a big difference.

>Ovarian cysts: HCG (human chorionic gonadotropin), a hormone made by the tumor, might cause fluid-filled cysts to form in the ovaries. These cysts can be large enough to cause abdominal swelling. They only occur with very high levels of HCG. Even though they can become quite large, they usually go away on their own about 8 weeks after the molar pregnancy is removed. Sometimes ovaries can twist on their blood supply (called torsion). This can cause severe pain and is treated with surgery to remove the cyst or a procedure to drain the fluid inside the cyst.

And it made me mad all over again that I HAD huge cysts after my loss. I wasn’t told about any increased or elevated risk - considering my history with cysts I should have been monitored.

I have recently joined this community too. My son Albert was born July 24th after finding out a few days before hand that he’d passed in utero, I was 31 weeks. No complications, no warning, just gone. I also don’t know at this point if there was any reason but he was very small.

It’s only been 11 days. Mentally and emotionally it’s a different story of course but it almost feels confusing that my body bounced back so quickly. 

I also felt the urgency to just want to start again, be pregnant again... I will say that the urgency is fading, I think a lot of it was hormone driven. It’s a relief that the feeling is dropping off because I know I need the time to rest and heal, and be absolutely certain that when we start again it’s because we’re ready and not because my body is screaming at me that I need a baby. But similarly, I get the “black hole” feeling, that anxiety about what comes next now. That, too, is getting better with time.

A study a two years ago looked at this.  They wanted to see if conceiving soon after a miscarriage led to worse outcomes.

It does sound like you gave your son every chance you could though. But I also absolutely understand questioning every decision and wondering if there was something, anything you could have done to save him, because it’s something that I have and do deal with. 

We found out our daughter had no heartbeat at 31 weeks and delivered her the next day. I felt less movements the day before, but she passed the kick count. The next day I lost my mucus plug and realized I hadn’t felt any movements for sure that day. I called the nurse line and they said if I thought I might be feeling the baby, even if it was very faint, then it was definitely the baby and not to worry. I went on a few more hours thinking I might be feeling movements and they said I could wait till the next day. But I still wasn’t comfortable and went in. But I delayed. What if I had gone straight in? What if I had gone in the day before, or even that morning? Could I be holding my baby instead of having her ashes? I think it will always haunt me. But I might have gone in, they say she looks great and sent me on my way, just to have her die when I got back. Or it might have already been too late and she was already dead. Or she might have been born sooner, but still have died. There’s a million questions and there’s no way to know the answers. We also don’t know why Serena died, which just leads to more questions. I understand wondering if there’s something more you could do, but in the end it doesn’t help anything so I try not to dwell on it too much. 

As far as your living child, I understand the difficulty in navigating that, too. We have a 3 1/2 year old and this is how she was introduced to death. She knew about Serena and she was very excited so we had to tell her. She still doesn’t really get it though. She does ask questions and we try to answer them as best as we can.

It does sound like you gave your son every chance you could though. But I also absolutely understand questioning every decision and wondering if there was something, anything you could have done to save him, because it’s something that I have and do deal with. </p>

<p>We found out our daughter had no heartbeat at 31 weeks and delivered her the next day. I felt less movements the day before, but she passed the kick count. The next day I lost my mucus plug and realized I hadn’t felt any movements for sure that day. I called the nurse line and they said if I thought I might be feeling the baby, even if it was very faint, then it was definitely the baby and not to worry. I went on a few more hours thinking I might be feeling movements and they said I could wait till the next day. But I still wasn’t comfortable and went in. But I delayed. What if I had gone straight in? What if I had gone in the day before, or even that morning? Could I be holding my baby instead of having her ashes? I think it will always haunt me. But I might have gone in, they say she looks great and sent me on my way, just to have her die when I got back. Or it might have already been too late and she was already dead. Or she might have been born sooner, but still have died. There’s a million questions and there’s no way to know the answers. We also don’t know why Serena died, which just leads to more questions. I understand wondering if there’s something more you could do, but in the end it doesn’t help anything so I try not to dwell on it too much. </p>

<p>As far as your living child, I understand the difficulty in navigating that, too. We have a 3 1/2 year old and this is how she was introduced to death. She knew about Serena and she was very excited so we had to tell her. She still doesn’t really get it though. She does ask questions and we try to answer them as best as we can. She does also say a lot of things that end up being hurtful, but I know she’s not doing it intentionally. We also have a 14 month old and I don’t know when we’ll start talking about it with her, but it’s very important to us that both girls know about the sister they never got to meet.</p>

I know your world will never be the same.  

Our son was also diagnosed with CHDs needing multiple surgeries starting birth.  As with Linden, there was a chance the surgeries would fail, and he wouldn't survive---more so if he wasn't born at term.  It was also likely the surgeries would leave him with some neurological impairments and delays.  Like you, we wanted to proceed anyway.  

Unfortunately, the genetic testing came back with a diagnosis that even the cardiologist and genetic counselor hadn't expected.  It meant his CHDs weren't isolated, his ability to undergo surgery was severely compromised, and his prognosis was very poor.  

In our case, it felt like the only thing we could do for our son was make sure he was spared a death with pain and suffering, so we opted for a TFMR.  Like you, we didn't get to meet our son alive, but were grateful we got to hold him, take pictures, get footprints, and make those memories.  

After our son died, I spent a lot of time thinking, ""would it have been better if...""  I came to understand, by reading & listening to other people's stories, that no matter what decisions we might have made, the end result would be just as devastating---just the details that we question, the specific things we carry guilt about, might be a little different.  The guilt and second guessing is normal--it's something we have to wrestle with before we can put it down.  

I also remember how wrong it felt to laugh or have a moment where I was feeling ""normal"".  But everyone grieves in their own way, and at their own pace--there's no one right way to do it, and it's healthy to let yourself feel however you're feeling in the moment, and not get too down on yourself about that.  

These are early days--just take them one at a time.  And if you're not in touch with a bereavement counselor and/or parent support group for perinatal loss, I recommend looking into it.  (Our hospital and my OB both gave me recommendations.)  Those sources of support were really helpful for me--especially after my husband was healing faster than me, and I still needed places to talk, process, etc.  

I hope you and your husband are taking good care of yourselves and each other.  Big hug!

I was undergoing fertility treatments and had found a clinic that would do RPL testing after I had 2 first trimester MMCs after heartbeat, and they were the ones who prescribed me enoxaparin. The public hospital would have only prescribed it after 12 weeks. 

Your protein S is more borderline but (note it goes down during pregnancy too but should be back to normal within 6 weeks after) combined with the second abnormal result, I definitely think it should be taken more seriously. I would try to find a place that will prescribe it, maybe call up fertility clinics and see if any of them would. Or get a second or third opinion from other doctors that may have a different outlook on this. Despite my not-super-low protein S value, I had a misdiagnosed DVT in my early 20s (only realized in retrospect, was a medical mystery from my past and a vascular surgeon had imaged my shoulder to find the ""pinched vein"" after my arm blew up to double it's normal size for weeks - it spontaneously went away on its own, as a clot does, before I got to the point of surgery) plus the 2 miscarriages which may or may not have been caused by it. There can be more going on with your unique makeup than these tests can reveal, and I don't think all protein S mutations are equal. There are both raw levels (which are reduced by these mutations and the only thing they test for) AND protein activity which can be affected by a mutation. Unlike things like Factor V Leiden mutations, there are hundreds of known ones in protein S that they don't understand the differences between physiologically and thus they don't bother sequencing the gene to find out what it is, they just check for raw levels of the protein. I'm a scientist very well versed in genetics, probably much moreso than most doctors, and find many doctors' approaches to this extremely frustrating and not based in the reality of what is known vs not known. 

BTW baby aspirin helps with APS, but not with thrombophilias. You need to be on a heparin for those. I had my 2 MCs despite already being on aspirin.

We get paid on Monday and we'll be buying a little memory box to put things in.

I don't want his birthday to always remind me of the day my baby left my body. I feel selfish because I know they want that baby out but I just need it to stay in a little longer. Especially because they're such close friends. Like we'll be at his birthdays every year for the rest of his life so I just don't want to also remember it as a bad day. I want to enjoy and celebrate him without being a little sad.

Just wanted to make sure everyone's had a chance [to read and weigh in on the changes we're making to the subreddit for next week. ](https://www.reddit.com/r/ttcafterloss/comments/93qfkw/changes_in_the_sub)

We are trying to figure out how to best support:
* People in very early pregnancy after loss
* People who are in limbo before a likely loss but it's not 100% yet, especially if this will be their first loss. For example, while waiting for amniocentesis results.

While not significantly compromising this subreddit being a safer place for those who are still in the trenches and trying or waiting to try to get pregnant again.

Ideally the first group would be comfortable moving to r/pregnancyafterloss pretty quickly, but we know that can be hard, especially after repeat pregnancy loss. The second group, however, is tough. r/Cautiousbb is technically the best place for them on Reddit, but is there a place for them on either of our subreddits too?

Any thoughts? Feel free to weigh in here or in the thread.

The Results thread has come full circle! Nearly two years ago, a lot of people were avoiding the Results thread, because it was only positives (even though it's designed to be for all results), so people started posting their negatives as a kind of radical, tongue in cheek pushback, and then it finally caught on and people started using the thread more as it was intended again.

The majority of these posts that we've gotten in the Alumni thread since PAL was created have been from people new to our subreddit. I'm not sure if they had just found us or if they're lurkers, but they're usually not people who had moved over to PAL. PAL is still pretty new and small, and while we're doing our best to advertise it here, we haven't really marketed it to the rest of the TTC/pregnancy reddit world, because I wanted our members to shape the subreddit and the culture before opening it up (people are welcome to join no matter how they find it, but it's not on the sidebar of any other subreddit yet).

>  At that point, I imagine it's a little odd to come back to TTCAL and straddle the two subs.  

Agreed!

>But since there seems to be a need, would the community grow back if the daily sub was ""rebranded"" and people there weren't nudged to the new sub?  

I dunno honestly. I don't think so? I lurk regularly on PAL, and it's already grown to be far more active than the Alumni thread ever was.  I think it's important to continue to maintain a strong community between the two subereddits, and we're open to all suggestions for how to do so, but I do think that trying to house both communities on one subreddit was becoming too difficult without making everyone unhappy (even over ""little"" things like is it or isn't it okay to had current pregnancy due dates mentioned in flair). I mean, just the fact that there's no clear answer about where to put posts from people in limbo shows how delicate intermingling those who are and aren't pregnant is. I don't want to be as strict as r/infertility is about the separation, given we have all dealt with loss and the separation is very grey for us, but it's going to take time to figure out the current ideal boundary (and I expect it to shift over time).

>Are there enough mentions of /r/PregnancyAfterLoss around TTCAL that people can find their way there when their ready?

I hope so, but would love to hear if not!

  
Thank you very much for engaging in this discussion! It's very helpful for us to hear what people want and/or why they're hesitating over current changes. Even though I'm still ""in the trenches,"" my loss is not as fresh anymore and my own needs and wants have changed over time. I actually find the TTC Daily thread triggering at times (and haven't stepped foot in TFAB for ages now).

<p>I’m better news my flow has been heavy which is very reassuring that my adhesion removal surgery worked.  Also I’m now 1/2 lb away from my pre-pregnancy weight and very close to my 7% weight loss goal with the program I’m doing through my work.</p>

If we didn’t find answers there we would have moved onto looking into my uterus to see if there were structural issues or not, but we found that I had two different clotting issues. So I started taking baby aspirin when we decided to TTC again and started lovenox injections once we got pregnant for the fourth time. We are now almost 35 weeks pregnant. It’s hard to say whether the aspirin and lovenox is what made a difference or if we just had better luck this time. My RE is convinced the two clotting issues are why we couldn’t carry a pregnancy to term before, but the doctor’s at MFM don’t think there is a substantial link between the issues I have and recurrent miscarriage, I don’t know. Regardless, this is the longest I’ve been pregnant and I have no reason to think it won’t work out this time, so there is hope after repeat loss. My biggest regret though is not pushing harder to get the testing done after two losses, instead of three. Good luck and I’m sorry you’re going through this!</p>

I’m sorry you’re going through this.


I’ve had four miscarriages and one live birth (my daughter is 2 months old today). My first two miscarriages happened naturally before I’d seen a doctor. My third was a blighted ovum (I suspect my first was as well). My fourth was a triploid embryo. We found out because we had it tested after my D&C. That’s something you may want to ask for, if this isn’t a blighted ovum.

The other kinds of tests you have done will depend on your individual situation. Since my losses were all unrelated genetic things, the only tests I had done were thyroid levels and two sonohysterograms. I have half a thyroid and large uterine fibroids, which were the reasons for those. Otherwise, they wouldn’t have recommended any tests for me. My official diagnosis from seeing an RE was “shit luck.”

As far as what was different after my losses, my OB let me have early scans at 6-7 weeks with pregnancies 3, 4, and 5. With pregnancy 5, I decided not to do betas because they had been “perfect” in pregnancies 3 and 4, and I didn’t want to go through that again.

Being with Albie after his birth was easier than I expected. I didn't think I was going to want to spend much time with him once he was out, but we ended up staying with him until about lunchtime the next day. The hospital staff were completely wonderful and told us we could have whatever time we needed, and the midwife in charge sat and waited with him in the room when we were ready to walk out. It seems like a little thing but when she asked if I'd like her to stay with him, I realised I hated the thought of him being alone and having her willing to sit with him felt like the greatest kindness she could have done for us. We also had a photographer come in and take photos of us free of charge, we've already received the photos back and she did such a beautiful job.  


As much as I do want to jump back in the ring I am definitely making myself just slow down and wait and not make any decisions on that front because I know I need time to process and heal and work through it. I really can't do anything about it until I've had the follow ups with my doctors and midwives anyway.

I’m so sorry for your losses. I’ve had four early losses (before 7 weeks) and I understand how heartbreaking it all is. 

After my second MC we had the full panel of tests. I did a sonohysterogram, had blood taken to test for immune issues, blood clotting issues and other possible causes for my losses. Everything came back normal, just my husband SA showed a slightly low count. 

After my fourth MC my RE said we should move on to IVF with PGS, which we did and got five euploid embryos. Between my egg retrieval and first transfer, I had a hysteroscopy done and a septum removed that was never seen before. 

My second frozen transfer worked and I’m now 15 weeks. What worked? Who knows. It could have been shitty luck or a combination of all my interventions (I was given what is called the kitchen sink approach during my transfer). 

I don’t think most recurrent miscarriage cases will have to get to the point of IVF or surrogacy. We did IVF as more of a diagnostic tool than anything else. 

Many specialists say after 3 losses you should get a recurrent loss panel of tests. Some say even after two. Given your age I would probably test as soon as possible to help eliminate any potential causes for your losses.

When I delivered my son, he was about half the size of Albert.  I also had no tearing, etc.  I was sent home 14 hrs after delivery. 
 We were cleared for sex after 3 weeks, and cleared for TTC after about 6 weeks.  My period came back after 5 weeks, but my first 3 cycles were wonky, and I suspect anovulatory (due to a lack of positive OPKs).

The 6-week recommendation aside, my OB told us we should TTC when we felt ready (i.e. not when I wanted to be pregnant again---that was as soon as I left the hospital--but rather, when we were ready to cope with the challenges of PAL).  He's had patients get pregnant again earlier than they'd wanted to, and it's a more anxious, fraught experience.  He said that he's happy to see patients more often if they're having difficulties with PAL-anxiety.  But it's easier for couples if they wait until they're ready to TTC.  I do think my fear and anxiety became more manageable with time.  

Beyond me personally, the guidance for early miscarriages is that women technically don't even have to wait for a period before starting to TTC again.  

But for full-term deliveries, there's some thought that conceiving soon after delivery (within 6 months) raises the risk of premature birth for that subsequent pregnancy.  I don't feel like women with full-term stillbirths are always given the same recommendation to wait as women with full-term live births, though, so I'm not sure how reliable that recommendation is.  And while you were in the 3rd trimester, I'm not sure how relevant recommendations for ""full-term"" would be.  It might be something to run by your doctor.

A last thought is that it would be good to know if your son's case would clinically be considered IUGR.  Hopefully his low weight and stillbirth were just rare bad luck.  But I think clinical IUGR does have a recurrence risk, so it would be good to know if you might need extra monitoring for that in a future pregnancy.  

I think from the time we got our son's diagnosis to about a week after I delivered him, we were just kind of emotionally stunned.  When that wore off, the real grief set in.  As others recommended, a bereavement counselor or therapist with expertise in pregnancy/infant loss is a helpful resource.

<p>It&#39;s not for every ad service, and honestly, I don&#39;t remember the details of how I found it (e.g. if it was related to my browser, or a website), but maybe some Googling will help you find it.

Without breastfeeding, women tend to get their period back around 8 weeks post partum.  The first 1-3 cycles are often anovulatory.

Your doctor might suggest you wait a few months before getting pregnant again (technically about 1-1.5 years between pregnancies is recommended, but I believe that most doctors say it's not necessary to wait that long after a miscarriage or stillbirth), but you could get pregnant as soon as you start ovulating again.

As for the bleeding, as long as you're even spotting you should definitely use a condom to avoid infection. Lochia can take up to 6 weeks to stop completely. My doctor told me I could have sex the moment I felt comfortable with it, but I have heard that most commonly doctors recommend a 6 week wait post partum (regardless of damage).

My lochia stopped after about 10 days, we had sex, and then I started bleeding again and bled until almost exactly 6 weeks. And like I said, when my period came back, I had 3 anovulatory cycles before ovulating.

But it is such a long time that I have been taking it, that I don't quite remember how it was in the beginning.

I personally have problems when I take it after eating restaurant food. I don't know if that's because it is more fatty or salty or seasoned... but it us awful, I get very bad abdominal pain and diarrhea.

Ovulation on cd 29 isn't that bad! If you are ovulating by yourself that is great!

Please also think about trying myo-inositol. It is an over the counter supplement and doesn't have any side effects. It can be taken along with the metformin or just by itself.

The clomid works good for me. But many with pcos say, they prefer letrozole. 

With clomid I get a bit more energy before ovulation and sometimes that is close to aggressiveness, like all the energy is a bit too much for me..

With letrozole I get a bad headache right away and I get grumpy and I am not in the mood for bd. Not very helpful... 

It doesn't seem like you need a high dose of these meds. I quarter the 50 mg dose and thus stimulate with 5 days 12.5 mg and that is enough to ovulate around cd 18.

You could also not take any meds at this point and first try what the myo-inositol does for you. 

Good luck!!

Edit: Please also check out r/pcos!

I'm going to do a ~~short~~ introduction in this post, so here is your official **content warning** for MMC, BO, ongoing but doomed pregnancy, and living child.

The TL;DR is basically my flair: MMC March 2016, rainbow baby born March 2017, another MMC/BO coming up in August 2018.

I was here back in 2016/17 under a different username after losing my first pregnancy at 11 weeks to MMC. What followed was a very difficult and anxious year of grief and TTC and eventually a successful pregnancy. My second baby was due on the anniversary of my loss, but came a few days after, so that's a super confusing time of year for me. In January of this year we started TTC#2 (or #3, depending on how you look at it) and were lucky enough to conceive in May. I was happy and excited and looking forward to having a pregnancy that wasn't plagued by loss, but it wasn't long before the anxiety started creeping in. This pregnancy was hard. I've been exhausted and nauseated and honestly I've not been the parent my toddler deserves. But the end of the first trimester was in sight and I was hopeful that things would get better. I had a scan booked for last Thursday, which would have been about 10 weeks. I tried my foetal doppler the day before because scans are super triggering to me, and I couldn't find anything. I know it was early but I couldn't even find the placenta. I knew there was something wrong. I'd suspected it for a while because this pregnancy was so very similar to the first. It was confirmed at the scan. There was less there than even I was expecting to see. An irregular gestational sac with a yolk sac but nothing else. This pregnancy never even really had a chance to get started. The hospital is making me come back next Thursday for a follow up scan to ""make sure"" even though it's very clear that there's no way this is a viable pregnancy. On the one hand, I can understand them wanting to check, on the other, I know they know there's not going to be a change. My mum thinks they're waiting in the hope that I will miscarry naturally but apparently the gestational sac is measuring 6-7 weeks, which means my body's already had 3-4 weeks to deal with this and I'm still having strong (and miserable) symptoms, so I don't think that's likely. So I have until Thursday to decide whether to have a medically managed miscarriage or a surgically managed one. I had a D&C last time, and I'm leaning towards doing it again because I need to be back on my feet to care for my kid as soon as possible. But I'm not sure, surgery for a pregnancy this size sort of feels like an overreaction. But then I don't think I can face taking the Misoprostol and just waiting it out at home.

I'm struggling a little bit with how to grieve/recognise this pregnancy because there never really was a baby. I know lots of people here will have been there before so I hope someone might have some pointers. My first I recognise in so many ways. He was real and perfect, even if he didn't make it. He has a name, and a tree, and a charm on my bracelet, just like my living daughter. But is it too much to do the same for this baby that never was?

I have birth to my first baby, George, last year. He died at 34+2. Strong heartbeat the day before, then suddenly no movement and he'd died. My recovery was fairly tough. George was large for his gestational age (6lb1oz) and I had to have an episiotomy. I couldn't sit down for 2 weeks due to the swelling and pain. I also bled on and off for around 5 weeks postpartum. I was told no sex for at least 6 weeks due to risk of infection, which we followed. 

I think recovery time is completely individual, but it's definitely worth speaking to your doctor to get their opinion. 

We knew straight away that we wanted to try again asap. My periods returned 8 weeks postpartum and after that first cycle I started tracking temps/cervical fluid etc and using OPK's as I wanted to get pregnant asap. George was an oops baby, but having him made us realise we needed to start a family sooner rather than later. 

They didn't find any conclusive evidence why he died - placental issues, possible undiagnosed, uncontrolled gestational diabetes, a blood clotting problem I didn't know I had...or just bad luck.

I have to leave it charging when I’m not using it, can’t just charge it and unplug it - will go dead (con for traveling).

I don’t have to take it off the moment I wake up. I can wear it for a while, seems to know you’re awake.

Likewise, don’t have to wait until I’m about to fall asleep to put it on. (I was trying to and this sometimes forgetting to put it on.) now I put it on as soon as I crawl in bed, even if I plan on reading for a while.

If I forget to sync it when I take it off or don’t have time that’s ok, I can unplug it and plug it back in later to get it to sync.

The app is a little funky. It will show predicted ovulation and not move the prediction, even if you ovulate late and pass the predicted date. When it confirms ovulation it shows a checkmark on its little ovulation symbol. Also there isn’t an option to enter OPK results, if you use those. Because of this, I’ve been logging my Ava temps in Fertility Friend.

Overall, I think it takes just as much time as temping with a traditional BBT. It just moves “when” I do things to before bed and not immediately after I wake up.

I would suggest taking a step back. Sit down with your husband and reassure him that you want to get pregnant, and that you do not blame him for previous losses.

It's true--even with adults--sometimes there's just not the energy to give the ""best"" response.  

I don't think everything has to be a teachable moment--if you're doing that, I give you a lot of credit. I just think it's helpful when we can use things that they're probably already hearing at home or at school to address sticky situations in a way that's age appropriate (and maybe already familiar to them).  

The experts say that kids worry most about big things (like divorce or dying) when they know something's wrong and they can tell adults are lying/won't talk to them about it.  That's why it's okay to say, ""I'm sad"" instead of ""I'm tired"".  

It's a struggle (especially when you're not the parent) to know what and how much to share--even more so if the parent isn't facilitating.  But I think kids can sometimes be satisfied with a basic answer that feels true.  (E.g. I've been tired because I've been sad.  I've been sad lately because something really sad happened.....or I've been sad a lot lately because I miss someone who went away (euphemistic, but more child-appropriate).)  You can also reassure them, e.g. that one day you'll feel better.  

It's tough stuff.  We lost our son late in the second trimester--we have his ashes, his pictures, his hospital hat, a Christmas ornament for him.  One day, we'll hope he'll have siblings, and at some point, we'll have to talk to them about their brother....and once they know, their cousins will eventually know...

I get what you mean about people being insensitive. I have to remind myself constantly that friends don't try to be insensitive on purpose and just don't know what to say/do because they personally have never gone through this type of loss. I also have to try to remind myself that if I had never gone through this, I likely would just say something annoying or offensive without meaning to. However, I still get frustrated, annoyed, offended and hurt at their responses at times and end up just internalizing it and thinking about it (I too wouldn't feel comfortable bringing that up to the ""offrienders"" (offenders+friends lol). 

With my first loss, I told two of my closest friends my story in an e-mail and said I just wanted them to listen (I already had others say things to try to cheer me up (""at least..."") that made it worse! but didn't mention that). Maybe that's an option the next time you mention your loss to your friends? Something along the lines of ""hey can I talk about how I'm feeling? No need to say anything, listening is all I need!"" Unfortunately, your friends will still slip and say some insensitive things. When that happens, I make a mental note not to talk to that friends anymore about it (which sucks cause it's alienating and I NEED to talk about it!).

I also tried to quit social media for a bit (after my 3rd loss I was not in the mood to see how great everyone else's lives were). But then I ended up missing social media so sometimes i try to go on a separate account where I don't follow any friends and only follow specific accounts of my interest (animals, food, etc.).

TTCAL and PAL are never worry free, but having your questions answered is better for the worry than uncertainty over the cause of a loss and possible prevention.  If your OB doesn't provide good answers, consider finding one who *will*.

First, so sorry for your losses 💕 I wanted to share because we have very similar stories except in opposite orders. I had a PMP then early miscarriage at 7 weeks (was dx blighted ovum). We did end up getting testing done; I got the standard RPL blood panel and we both got chromosome analysis with our blood. No sperm analysis for my husband. At first, we were also told if we had 3 losses we’d proceed with testing, but ended up getting another doctor at our practice for a follow up visit after my blighted ovum (I got to a practice at a large teaching hospital in my area) and she said we could move forward with repeat loss testing if we wanted. Both maternal fetal medicine doctors I met with in addition to a genetic counselor told us that there is little to suggest that PMPs are the result of any genetic issue with males or females. They are simply a fluke. In fact, one MFM even told us that the “good news” with a PMP is that the chromosomes are perfect, there’s just a whole extra set of them, suggesting that two healthy sperm got into an egg. If hubby had 2 healthy sperm available to fertilize an egg, that could possibly suggest he’s actually got a good sperm count. And then with the early losses, well, it just happens just like for the rest of the general population. Anyway, I think if you want to move forward with testing that is of course a personal choice and if given the option my husband and I would most likely have done the sperm analysis just to know for sure. But, as far as I understand from what the doctors told us, there would be no reason to suspect based on the PMP and and early loss combination that anything abnormal would have been found.

On another note, I am glad to hear your levels went down quickly and you are cleared from monitoring. That was such a hard time for me to go in to the office constantly to get my blood tested and sort of be on edge about the whole thing. Happy to talk more if needed!

I don't think anyone is trying to be insensitive. Babies do come out all sizes and this lady was trying to help you feel included. No one knows how you will feel about it, so you just need to tell them. Ie ""I know babies are all sizes and shapes, I wasn't expecting you to explain my baby's size. I just wanted someone to hear me vent."" Or ""I understand you are trying to ensure my inclusion as a mommy, but I am not ready for this kind of social outlet. I have removed myself from the group, please do not try to readd me."" 

I get it, I have been there, I had someone tell me once ""I just didn't know how to deal with you."" After my first loss, though she didn't tell me this until I was almost to term with my son two years later. She just disappeared on me which was really hard. I thought she was my friend. 

Your body is meant to do many things, and unfortunately, due to genetics or hormones or whatever, pregnancy is a touchy and difficult thing for many. See three losses over here... You are still alive. You are still here and have the opportunity to keep your daughter's memory alive and advocate for women who have second trimester losses. Many women do not feel like they can or should speak out. If you stay on social media, I encourage you to. I post about my losses frequently despite having successful pregnancies down the line. You would be surprised how many people (women and men) thank me for standing up for those who have lost a baby or many babies. I had no idea one of my friends' wives had three losses and a preterm babe until I posted about how important it is to normalize the conversation of loss, especially multiple losses. This woman ended up having four kids, but each pregnancy took a larger toll on her in the long run. 

I hope you find peace and find it in your heart to forgive those you recognize as insensitive. I would recommend a complete social media (even Pinterest) break for at least a few months to allow your heart to heal. I didn't make a big show of leaving it ""due to everyone's insensitivities of our loss..."" Or ""I am taking a break from social media because...""

For women who aren't TTC, most doctors will only diagnose hypothyroidism when TSH is above 5 and a woman notices symptoms. Your TSH would be within these boundaries. For women who are TTC or are pregnant, many doctors try to keep TSH < 2.5, preferably closer to 1. Your result is still within these bounds, but perhaps isn't ideal. 

To me, it seems unlikely such a small deviation had any effect. But there are options for more testing if you worried. Your doctor could order a full thyroid panel, which includes TSH, free T3, and free T4. This would give a more complete picture of the levels of thyroid hormones. You could also ask to be tested for thyroid antibodies. The most common cause of hypothyroidism is an autoimmune issue called Hashimotos.

I began and closed the email by telling people that this topic was off limits, and people can give me a hug or say ‘thinking of you’, but no more, because there’s nothing that can be said that will make me feel any better. Maybe you could send an email, a text, or have somebody at work tell everyone else so you only have to go through it once. </p>

- I'm going to my doctor later this afternoon. I'm hoping they'll do an ultrasound and possibly a blood test for HCG. Is there anything else I should ask for?
- what should I expect with recovery from a chemical pregnancy? From what I understand this should be a lot more like a 'normal' period than with my last loss which went on FOREVER. 
- for those who've had chemical pregnancies, did you ovulate the cycle of your loss? Right now I want to jump straight back into ttc. Last time I had a loss it took 2-3 cycles to get back to normal so I'm hoping it doesn't take as long.

Blood clotting panel

Progesterone tests 
Genetic tests for both
Karyotypes for both
SA + DNA frag for him 
AMH for you 
HSG for you / sonohyst
Autoimmune panel

I lost my first born son, Harrison, at 23 weeks as a still birth March of last year. At that time, I don’t think I could’ve ever thought i would ever get the courage to get to where I am today, though I very much wanted to. The first several weeks after we lost Harrison were the hardest - we cried every morning after waking up knowing it was not just a dream, we cried every evening thinking about him and how things could’ve been. Then slowly, we tried to move forward, as we believe that is what he would want us to do. 

We started trying again about half a year later. When I got pregnant again, I was terrified. I was so scared it would happen all over again. I bought a Home Doppler so I can hear the heartbeat whenever I was overly anxious (which was about every 7-10 days). I couldn’t wait until I can feel the baby kick. And when I was finally able to feel the kicks, I was anxious every moment I couldn’t feel kicks. I counted down the days until the next ultrasound. Then at every ultrasound, l sat at the edge of my seat until the doctor says everything is okay. 

To be honest, the worrying didn’t stop when we heard my daughter cry out for the first time. We still worry that she’ll fall asleep at night and won’t wake up. But that is parenthood, I guess. 

I don’t mean to make you feel anxious about trying for your rainbow baby. I want you to know that there is a rainbow after the storm, though it may be a rough road ahead, you WILL get there, one way or another.

I have a positive story! I had a MMC last summer that was discovered at 12 weeks but had stopped progressing at 7. I had a D&C but ended up with some retained tissue and lots of bleeding, so I opted for a second D&C 3 weeks later. I got my period back on time, if the day of the first D&C was CD1, but I still bled after it was over. It turns out I *still* had a little retained tissue (about the size of my pinky nail) that I passed during my second period after the loss. I bled for literally two months straight. The procedures themselves were easy and pain-free, but I had a much worse than typical recovery. Last summer was the worst.

Okay, but here’s where it gets positive: I got pregnant that second cycle afterwards. We didn’t try before that because I was still bleeding and not ready. I was so done putting my body through loss after loss, so my husband and I decided that pregnancy #5 would be the last no matter the outcome. Luckily everything worked out and our daughter was born at the end of May. July 18th was the year anniversary of my second D&C, and I spent it snuggling with my rainbow baby.

This is the endless conversation loop of hell. I got it from my OBGYN (who said IVF wasn’t an option because ovarian stimulation isn’t an option due to my cysts.) I got it from the RE the OBGYN referred me to. And now I am getting it again from the 2nd RE.

I also asked the new RE what happens when I get one of my huge cysts immediately after quitting HBC and starting IVF retrieval meds. New RE said they’ve never seen a mega ovarian cyst develop while on meds for retrieval. Seriously. My ovaries grow cysts like it’s their job.

Thankfully they offered to send me to the RE ahead of the normal 3 losses, which I accepted.

They didn&#39;t see anything in my uterus or anywhere else, but said that since they never saw anything in my uterus in the first place they couldn&#39;t confirm that everything was out (it still could have been ectopic, or in an unknown location).   I had a blood test every couple of days for about two weeks until they confirmed my HCG went down to 0, with strict instructions to get help immediately if I had any other symptoms appear (sharp pains, fever, etc.).  I had a follow up appointment a week after the original appointment, where I confirmed that the bleeding had stopped and they confirmed that my HCG levels were dropping appropriately.</p>

<p>Thankfully they offered to send me to the RE ahead of the normal 3 losses, which I accepted.</p>

<p>I feel like I received excellent care, and I know how lucky I am.  If you are unsatisfied with how you were treated, I would encourage you to seek out another doctor if you have that option.  I&#39;m sorry that you have to deal with this on top of the loss(es), it&#39;s just not right. </p>

Unfortunately, aftercare depends a lot on your doctor's office, their policies, how busy they are, etc. I miscarried at 6+5 and only did one beta test after the miscarriage.

That would be my SILs reasoning. “Oh look at me I’m so devastated my brother lost his baby. Now give me them sweet likes. Because attention!!!” Can you tell I’m still sour about it? 

And wtf? Earning stretch marks? If anyone had “earned” them it’s moms of an angel. And even then for me they were too painful to look at. 
Like I have these stretch marks, flappy skin, leaking and swollen breasts, a sore vagina, backpain from the epidural, lochia and no baby.

I’m not even sure if this is the best thread for this. I had my first miscarriage in March at 9+1 and was told to wait three cycles before trying again. I got pregnant first cycle and just lost that pregnancy yesterday at 6+5. 

I am kind of in shock right now and it’s quickly turning to anger. I thought my OB practice handled my first loss okay. I didn’t really have a frame of reference, but it seemed like decent care. They are basically treating me like crap this time around. I am 36, I had one previous loss, and the nurse who talked to me today basically didn’t want to schedule any kind of appointment for this miscarriage for two weeks. What?! Last time I had an ultrasound the same day to check for retained tissue and was prescribed a dose of misoprostol. I told her what they did for me last time, and she basically gaslighted me over the phone and told me that’s not how they do things. 

I am furious. I chewed her out and hung up on her. Maybe not what I should’ve done, but I’m obviously going through a hard time. My husband called back and demanded the doctor talk to me. So I’m waiting to hear from her. But I am done with these people after today. I want to make sure I’m okay right now, but wow...maybe I spend too much time reading worst case scenarios, but I think it’s extremely unprofessional for them to treat patients this way. 

I know three losses is typical before testing is done, but hopefully I can find a doctor who will help me now considering my age. I can’t do this again. It is the worst heartbreak.

I can also understand that feeling that no one will be able to sympathize the pain you felt. That the world just keeps moving on, whether you are grieving still or not.  

I've started to cut off a good high school friend because of her lack of empathy - it just feels shocking, it makes me wonder if she ever cared? 

When I texted her about what was happening, and that we might lose Mabel she responded (to the diagnoses) ""Is that bad??"" hours later I was able to just respond ""yes.""

I had lunch with her and another good high school friend and she said she ""Understood"" because she is feeling baby crazy but can't have a baby yet. In the same lunch she mentioned that her ""friend with benefits"" has a son who is so cute and his ex-wife and him had a still born child. Every time he drives past the graveyard where she is he \*kisses two fingers and points them outward\* and she said it like it was such a heartfelt and romantic thing for him to do - as though we should coo over how sensitive he must be. I'm like, shit girl, he lost his baby and you are showing NO respect. 

I know that for some people, they just don't know how to express their sympathy but at the same time - we are not responsible for the way they express themselves and we are not required to sympathize with their inability to sympathize.

And for your ignorant and insensitive family. :( 

It is easy to think ""they don't know better"" or ""I'm being too sensitive"". But in all actuality, you have every right to be sensitive and expect some fucking empathy. You lost your child. I am so very sorry that your family doesn't seem capable of giving you the support you need. Or even just being decent human beings.

You do not sound like you are making a mountain out of a mole hill. Not at all. Unfortunately some people just can't be there for others if they don't relate. To be fair, they ARE ignorant of what loss like this feels like. But there are many people who have never experienced such pain who are at least able to be more sensitive. And to fucking CARE.

It sounds like you had good relationships before and I assume that means you'd like to try to keep one/reestablish one. I hope your therapist can help you reconnect with them. But please don't do it at YOUR expense. Not at all. Don't just do it to do it...don't do it if they can't figure their shit out and be there for you. That is NOT what you need. It's hard to let go, but it happens -- life happens. People change. Situations change. And friendships/relationships change. I held on to a few relationships way longer than I should have, even though they weren't there for me after loss. But that is not what you need. And friendships are supposed to be during the good and the bad. 

I wish I could help more. I'm willing to smack them upside the head if you'd like. :)

I’m sort of dealing with the same emotions as I prepare to venture back into the land of TTC. I too have an LC after three losses within the year prior to him. He is now seven months old. I don’t know what my chances are for having another, given that I only have one Fallopian tube and my progesterone has been low for all my losses, so my husband and I are sort of NTNP for now. I haven’t gotten a period yet, but I’ve weaned him and have stopped producing milk, so it’s only a matter of time. 

I don’t really know where my cycles stand yet, so I haven’t got much to track (ovulation, luteal phase length, etc), but when my cycles do start back I told myself I wouldn’t be so obsessed with it all. Fear of loss ruled me for 2 and a half years, and, to be honest, the irrational fear of losing my LC over something like SIDS is just starting to lessen. I’m definitely still damaged by all of this, despite the outcome.

So I guess my game plan is NTNP and “winging it.” I have leftover progesterone from when I last needed it, so if I know for sure that I ovulated and the sex was well-timed I can take it if I want. I do log every time we have sex on my app in case I need to know dates later on, but I am not letting myself log other details just yet. 

I feel guilty preventing pregnancy because I don’t want to “waste” any chances, but I’m not sure if I’m ready to make my body go through it all again. My focus for the past few months has been to really try and soak up the present rather than dwell on the past or fret about the future. This is something that is extremely hard for me, given my history with TTC. I’m not really sure how I would react to another loss. The grief, as you said, would probably feel familiar. I think part of the really why I’m taking the NTNP approach is so that I don’t have to face my old fears. Part of me hopes that I can magically be that person who finds out she’s pregnant at around 8 weeks instead of my usual 4 weeks so that my chances of loss are less. And I guess I’m naively hoping that my low progesterone won’t be a thing. I’m continuing to take my prenatal vitamins, I don’t drink, and I live healthy, so if another one does come along I will be prepared. Sorry that was kind of a book. Loss definitely chances things.

<p>I feel guilty preventing pregnancy because I don’t want to “waste” any chances, but I’m not sure if I’m ready to make my body go through it all again. My focus for the past few months has been to really try and soak up the present rather than dwell on the past or fret about the future. This is something that is extremely hard for me, given my history with TTC. I’m not really sure how I would react to another loss. The grief, as you said, would probably feel familiar. I think part of the really why I’m taking the NTNP approach is so that I don’t have to face my old fears. Part of me hopes that I can magically be that person who finds out she’s pregnant at around 8 weeks instead of my usual 4 weeks so that my chances of loss are less. And I guess I’m naively hoping that my low progesterone won’t be a thing. I’m continuing to take my prenatal vitamins, I don’t drink, and I live healthy, so if another one does come along I will be prepared. Sorry that was kind of a book. Loss definitely chances things. I didn’t think it would still affect me as much as it did postpartum.</p>
