 The other night I woke up 5 times to pee, and cant sleep for two nights. I only did that while pregnant, so of course my brain is all ""Hey, take a test, it's fun, you'll love the mixed emotions!""

So I take one of my ultra-sensitive ones 10mui. Aaaand a very faint pink line. But very faint. Too early but I freak out and post on TFABlineporn. They say neg because too early. I figure okay. Ask another friend. They say indent. 

So I take more. One has a pink line, the other two neg. So I'm like fine, it's evaps or indents. Rollercoaster of emotions, and I cried. 

So this morning I test aaaand there's another very faint line. I'm going to lose my mind I swear. So I'm stuck waiting. 

They are 100% pink, the full thickness of the line (not the super skinny evaps/indents), and show up within 20 seconds. 

Just upset and need someone to vent to. I am being realistic that it is too soon to be pos, just it is painful after we made this big decision not to, and this isn't helping. 

Edit: I want another baby so bad, just so no one is confused. We put a hold on things as we were under a lot of stress. Would be very very happy if pregnant :)

Be interesting to see if preventing ovulation did anything or not.   </p>

If I could get it together to just get into the shower things got better little by little from there, and by the evening I'd feel almost ""normal.""  The feeling of ""how is everyone else in the world going about their business when I am hurting so much?"" is the worst.  It feels like a scene from a movie where everything isa blur around you but you're stuck in slow-motion.  What sucks is that the only thing that can really make those feelings better is time...and time passes so slowly.   

I'm so glad that physically your wife is doing OK.  Placental abruption is no joke, an I wouldn't be surprised if things had gotten really scary there in the hospital.  So, so glad that she's OK and that you can get back to trying again with no issues.  I wound up having some retained tissue that kept me bleeding for weeks and weeks, although my doctors kept trying to assure me nothing was wrong because I didn't have classic symptoms of a fever or hemorrhage.  (I feel like the antibiotics they had me on in the hospital probably did that - IC is something you're diagnosed with after they rule everything out, and initially they thought I might have wound up with an infection and put me on IV antibiotics. Placenta came back clear, though.)  Not healing up correctly and finding out I needed a D&C added insult to injury and was really my low point about a month after the loss.  

Counseling was a no-brainer for me.  I've watched many close friends and family suffer through mental illness and emotional stressors in really unhealthy ways and learned from day 1 that there's no stigma or shame attached to getting help.  There are a lot of pieces of this grief that I needed someone else to give me the words to describe and work through, and the struggle to get pregnant again would have been absolutely crushing without our counselor.  I also know that the worry that will come along with a subsequent pregnancy is something I'm going to want her help dealing with.  

Keep hanging in there.  Please let your wife know she can reach out anytime, too.  If e-mail or Facebook or something is easier for her than the relative anonymity of reddit,  I'm honestly happy to share that privately, too.  I found that the more I shared Ethan's story in the fall, and the more people I found who were ""safe"" to pour out all my emotions to, the better I felt.  I still feel that way.

<p>I&#39;m so glad that physically your wife is doing OK.  Placental abruption is no joke, an I wouldn&#39;t be surprised if things had gotten really scary there in the hospital.  So, so glad that she&#39;s OK and that you can get back to trying again with no issues.  I wound up having some retained tissue that kept me bleeding for weeks and weeks, although my doctors kept trying to assure me nothing was wrong because I didn&#39;t have classic symptoms of a fever or hemorrhage.  (I feel like the antibiotics they had me on in the hospital probably did that - IC is something you&#39;re diagnosed with after they rule everything out, and initially they thought I might have wound up with an infection and put me on IV antibiotics. Placenta came back clear, though.)  Not healing up correctly and finding out I needed a D&amp;C added insult to injury and was really my low point about a month after the loss.  </p>

<p>Counseling was a no-brainer for me.  I&#39;ve watched many close friends and family suffer through mental illness and emotional stressors in really unhealthy ways and learned from day 1 that there&#39;s no stigma or shame attached to getting help.  There are a lot of pieces of this grief that I needed someone else to give me the words to describe and work through, and the struggle to get pregnant again would have been absolutely crushing without our counselor.  I also know that the worry that will come along with a subsequent pregnancy is something I&#39;m going to want her help dealing with.  </p>

<p>Keep hanging in there.  Please let your wife know she can reach out anytime, too.  If e-mail or Facebook or something is easier for her than the relative anonymity of reddit,  I&#39;m honestly happy to share that privately, too.  I found that the more I shared Ethan&#39;s story in the fall, and the more people I found who were &quot;safe&quot; to pour out all my emotions to, the better I felt.  I still feel that way.  Here for you both anytime you need it. </p>

Maybe try something that's a little less close to home for your cervix instead of swearing off sex completely? I imagine I'd be scared to try again after that...

We originally found my cervix shortening at my anatomy scan.  About a week before that we finally decided it was time to let our guard down; I'd had a fantastic doctor's appointment, I looked visibly pregnant and was feeling lots of movement, and we decided it was time to stop being worrywarts and bust out of our cautious infertile-couple shell and be happy about our pregnancy.  And then it all came crashing down.  

A placental abruption is a really, really scary thing.  Has your wife healed up OK?  How have you handled everything - my husband was a complete deer-in-headlights during our weekend at the hospital and I have never seen him look more terrified or helpless before or since.  He just wanted to fix everything and there was nothing he could do but hold my hand and try to wipe away my tears.  (I am going to assume you're a husband because I may have reddit stalked you and found some predaddit posts...but we have a few same-sex partners here, so I didn't want to be too presumptuous...anyway).  

We connected with a grief counselor who specializes in miscarriage, stillbirth, infant loss, and infertility, and she has helped tremendously.  If you haven't thought about taking care of your emotional needs that way, I'd highly recommend it.  I don't think people have a vocabulary to understand how you feel about a later loss like this and how it's fundamentally different than an earlier miscarriage.

",[],,t1_cs4pmw8,False,0,[],False,"<div class=""md""><p>I hear you on the worry.  We originally found my cervix shortening at my anatomy scan.  About a week before that we finally decided it was time to let our guard down; I&#39;d had a fantastic doctor&#39;s appointment, I looked visibly pregnant and was feeling lots of movement, and we decided it was time to stop being worrywarts and bust out of our cautious infertile-couple shell and be happy about our pregnancy.  And then it all came crashing down.  </p>

<p>A placental abruption is a really, really scary thing.  Has your wife healed up OK?  How have you handled everything - my husband was a complete deer-in-headlights during our weekend at the hospital and I have never seen him look more terrified or helpless before or since.  He just wanted to fix everything and there was nothing he could do but hold my hand and try to wipe away my tears.  (I am going to assume you&#39;re a husband because I may have reddit stalked you and found some predaddit posts...but we have a few same-sex partners here, so I didn&#39;t want to be too presumptuous...anyway).  </p>

<p>We connected with a grief counselor who specializes in miscarriage, stillbirth, infant loss, and infertility, and she has helped tremendously.  If you haven&#39;t thought about taking care of your emotional needs that way, I&#39;d highly recommend it.  I don&#39;t think people have a vocabulary to understand how you feel about a later loss like this and how it&#39;s fundamentally different than an earlier miscarriage.

<p>If you don&#39;t mind me asking, are you a dad or a female partner? We haven&#39;t had many dudes here so if you&#39;re a guy I&#39;m super excited, but having any of the non-gestational partners in here at all makes me happy! I wish my husband was more Internet oriented and had some kind of support network for what we went through. </p>

<p>I have my second guitar class tonight! I didn&#39;t really get to practice at all since I was on vacation most of the past week, woops. But I spent about an hour practicing last night and really enjoyed it. I loved how absorbing it was, most of all.  Physically and mentally, I had to focus all of my energy. Just what I need!</p>

He was like the nicest guy too, he was talking to everyone and smiling and he brought tootsie pops for all the employees ( I think he must have been a regular there). It was just one of those things that made me smile. I keep thinking I look fat but everyone around me can very much tell I&#39;m pregnant. It&#39;s weird, I didn&#39;t think I&#39;d look so obviously pregnant so early on. </p>

If the father is not the greatest guy, then will he be there for the induction?  See if she wants you to be at the hospital with her.  That was easily the worst day of my life, and if my supportive husband wasn't there I absolutely would have needed a friend.  She should not be alone during that.  Even if the husband is there she may still want you there too for support.  

If you do go to the hospital, and she is receptive, hold the baby, even if the baby is covered up.  If she doesn't want to look at the baby suggest that she have the nurse take photographs and put them into a sealed envelope, so that she can look in the future if she ever chooses to do so.  Help her make funeral arrangements.  

Since she knows you are TTC, I would not talk about it again until you are pregnant.  Because she is so far along in her pregnancy she will likely need to wait a minimum 3 months before trying again, but more likely 6-12 months (which is what my maternal-fetal medicine doc says because of how much pregnancy takes from a woman's body).   Her hearing that your OPK strip is positive or that you're ""trying tonight!"" is merely another reminder of the baby she can't have.   

I disagree with the other poster that you should ask her about how to tell her you're pregnant.  Her view on this right now will be radically different than in 3 months, 6 months, 1+ year down the line when you actually are pregnant. She is in the thick of it right now and is just beginning a long phase of grief.  I don't think asking her how you should tell her of your upcoming pregnancy is anywhere near appropriate now. 


Include her baby's name in conversations, validate the baby's existence.  Reach out to her on her 1 year anniversary of the induction date (many people fail to do this), and mark your calendar so you can do this every year.  

Thanks for being such a good friend to her!

Reasons vary - from people who want to stay away because they don't know what to say, or worse, people who wouldn't want anything negative to ruin their happy lives. 

For the second reason, there is no remedy and getting rid of those fair weather friends will improve anyone's life. But the fact that you are here OP, suggests that you care but do not know exactly how to comfort your friend. And I am glad you are taking proactive steps. She is lucky to have you!

She most probably is struggling with a lot, possibly even with attending your wedding and hearing about your TTC journey. Still, she chose to be there for you because she deeply cares for you. She's happy for you as well, even if she may feel sad because her life right now is so shitty (totally not your fault).

Tackling her grief is a gargantuan task for her, but you being there (while it may not really lessen the pain), assures her she is not alone. Her lovelife is shit, her pregnancy will most probably fail, but hey, at least you are there. 

So how exactly will you be there for her:
* talk to her. It could be about anything. Or..
* be there to listen. Seriously, sometimes there's no need for you so say so much.
* while she's recovering, offer to do some of her chores. You can also give food or coupons so she does not have to cook.
* do your usual bonding activities. Nails, spa, shopping, games, whatever.
* in case you do get pregnant, please do not hide it from her. But take care not to overload her with too many updates. Too much of anything can be annoying, loss mom or not.

There are many more (I wish my friends cared about me like you do with your BFF), but as a general rule, be your usual self with her.

My pregnancy ended at 22 weeks.... I have absolutely no idea if I would have been capable of being in public had I carried to term. I am 30 weeks now and everyone is always asking me about the baby and my pregnancy and if I didn't know this one was healthy I just don't know how I could cope. I am so amazed with her strength, especially at a wedding. 

I think your concern for her is so sweet, and probably exactly what she needs. It's so hard to give you advice not knowing where your friend is in her grief journey, but if she were me here is what I would want. First- talk to her all the time. Even about the pregnancy. People don't want to touch you with a 10ft pole after these things happen because they are so afraid to say the wrong thing, or that you are too fragile, or whatever. So much of her world is being destroyed she is probably craving some semblance of normalcy. Take her shopping, get your nails done, whatever you two do together. Also, be very open with her, tell her plainly that you are TTC, and that you are willing to share anything about that journey with her *when she asks.* I wouldn't talk about TTC with her without her asking how it's going, etc first though. Also, you said you aren't TTC yet, and a wedding is exciting enough- for now just keep all the focus on the upcoming ceremony and newlywedness, don't discuss or mention TTC until you actually are, so she doesn't have any extra stress to worry about.

As much as you are worried for her, she is probably also worried about you- being there for you enough, being excited enough for you, trying so hard to be a great friend to you too even though she is going through her own tragedy. And she already has a lot on her plate to worry about. With my BFF, I would be super open and honest about acknowledging this awkwardness so that we can at least have it out in the open and not festering. I was so angry and bitter about any pregnant person, or anyone TTC after my loss. Like viciously bitter. A year before though, my cousin had a stillbirth, and was having significant difficulty conceiving again. Four months after my daughter died, I found out she was 12 weeks pregnant with her rainbow- she found out shortly after my loss and my family was too afraid to tell me. I bawled my eyes out I was so insanely happy for her. It was so refreshing to know that something good was happening to someone who deserved it so much, and it definitely was a turning point for me personally. It was like this reminder to me that I didn't need to be so full of anger, and that good things still happened and mine would come too.

Also, in regards to her pregnancy- acknowledge her sons life, no matter how brief it might be. **Say his name** If he does pass away, be active and present and help her acknowledge his existence, she may want a memorial, but not have the strength to arrange it herself. Give her a memorial gift, a necklace with his name, an orchid to care for in his honor, plant a rose bush she can see and think of him- whatever is her style.

Lastly, congratulations on your wedding and TTC! Remember, another persons fertility levels or the health of their pregnancies have absolutely no impact on whatever goes on inside your uterus. The odds are overwhelmingly in your favor that you will conceive and carry a perfectly healthy baby to term :) Good luck and thanks for being a good friend!

Just like /u/Arrowmatic mentioned, I went through this at the end of September of last year and--pardon my language--it's just shitty. Take it easy on yourself because I know you have to be in pain from the surgery still. Focus on healing. 

My situation is a little different. I have endometriosis and Factor V Leiden (increased risk of blood clots), but yes, we were able to have a successful pregnancy (to this point-21 weeks-knock on wood) after the ectopic. Since I do ovulate, our protocol was to go in to the RE for an ultrasound when I got a positive OPK to check which side I was ovulating from (lost my right tube). We decided to do one month of timed inter course before moving to IUI and got lucky that first month. After that, we did vaginal progesterone from 3DPO. You will want to have a beta as soon as you get a positive test and check for doubling, as that can be the first indicator of an ectopic if your HCG is low and/or does not double in 48 hours. You'll also need an early ultrasound. Mine was at 6 weeks and we were able to verify that the baby had implanted correctly at that point. 

I'm assuming you're with an RE, so once you're healed and ready to try again, you can sit down and come up with a plan. You can follow similar protocol to what we did with IUI and Clomid, I believe. Or if you're more comfortable moving on to IVF given the increased risk of a subsequent ectopic, that's also an option. I say all of this to let you know that there is hope, you do have options, and even though there's a lot of pain and suck right now, you are strong enough to get through this. If you have questions or just need to vent, PM me anytime. 

Huge hugs and again, take care of yourself. I'm so sorry you went through this. 

ETA: I understand the whirlwind, too. Ectopic pregnancies are emergency situations, so everything happens so fast that you really only have time to just go with the flow and be grateful to have survived it. I was numb for a few weeks after my surgery and didn't experience any grief until later on. When it hit, it hit hard. Be kind to yourself and don't be scared to ask for help. Vent here as much as you need. This group is AMAZING. Not only have you been through the trauma of emergency surgery that will impact your fertility, but you did lose a baby, too.

So I went on my walk.  It was ok, but I was hoping to feel a lot more from it.  It turns out while I can't forget I can't feel anything at the moment either.  I am pretty numb.  I know this is probably my brain's way of protecting me, but..

The best part was probably the beer at the pub afterwards.  It took me 20 mins siting in the car to work up the confidence to go in (am having a lot of anxiety around people), but I sat down with my pint and wrote down a lot of things I am dealing with.  My relationship is struggling at the moment, and while some of it is definitely due to a lack of support (he hasn't even acknowledged this miscarriage and was not there when I needed for the first) some of this is probably from my side (withdrawing when I see him not reacting how I need).  But everything I wrote looked a lot like a breakup letter.

Triggers?  m/c, abuse

The whole process and some other family dramas has also brought up sexual abuse I suffered as a child.  My partner knows little about this, just that I hate my grandfather for what he did to my cousin.  Most of this has been dealt with many years ago, with a lot of therapy, but I think a combination of the D&C and aunts/uncles getting all vigilante now my grandmother is dead (because you know, now is the time to protect your children, seriously we are adults, that time has past and you are just trying to make yourselves feel better - and this is the unbelievable truth as they all feel better and have calmed down since they told my grandfather how what he did made *them* feel) has brought up a lot as well as grieving for the losses.  O and my mother's denial that her daughter was involved.   
My OB has given me a psychologist referral, I am just waiting for a call back, but will probably call again Monday.

So my partner had dinner cooked when I got home and I was going to give him my notes to read or have a chat, but he fell asleep. I then decide my notes were really too harsh and one sided and wrote a shorter one for him to read as I needed to do it now (I do have trouble communicating verbally about these things). I basically said that I was depressed and anxious, had been self harming and was seeing someone, but I need him to support me (he has not had a good track record with this) how he can support me and that he needs to take on the adult role. I also said if he can't that's ok, but I won't be able to be with him.  

There is no chance of me being in an unsupportive relationship and making it through.  So I guess there's a quasi ultimatum on the table.  My language was friendly and I really want to get through this, but I am nervous of his response.  He has just gotten up and I am in bed typing (need to sleep today for work tonight).

As far as work goes, only one week left now. Like I mentioned before, I am *hoping* to go back to school to get my Masters in Education (early childhood) starting next May, so I was thinking it would be cool to get a teaching job/job with kids in the meantime. 

**Here's where I need your advice:**

So there's this job that popped up where I would be working at a daycare as an early education teacher or a nursery supervisor. It pays $13/hr, full-time, only about 20 minutes from my house. The job has been posted for a while and now they are offering at $500 signing bonus. Should I even apply to this job? Either they're desperate or the job sucks and I don't know if it will really count towards real teaching hours/experience. Thoughts??

Been struggling to post, which makes me feel a bit useless as there have been a few intro posts I felt I could help with my experiences, just can't do it yet.  Thank you all again for your support.

My OB called me yesterday; despite the fact this pregnancy never quite made it to his care. I am seeing him in 2 weeks and despite him usually waiting the obligatory 3 miscarriages he wants to start the work up as mine have been so close together.  I was apathetic about it when I spoke to him, but am now glad we will do this.  Thrombophilia, chromosomes etc: everything.  He has also emailed me a referral for a psychologist, which I was going to need regardless of how the pregnancy went.  

Still bleeding, but slowing down.  Feel very weak; would like to sleep for about a month.
Am hoping for ok weekend weather Sat. I think I will drive down the coast and go on a 14 km walk that I have done a few times (then have a pint at the pub before heading home).  It's a beautiful cliff top then beach walk that at this time of year (early winter) should have that wild, electric energy to it.  This particular walk has been calling me for a while and I am hoping will recharge me. Was trying to organise a friend to walks to go with me, but she can't, not such a bad thing consider she didn't react well to the first miscarriage.  Alone is probably the best for now anyway.

I was in the hospital for 3 days after my emergency c section. My house was clean and ready for the baby. Mom, dad, my sister, and her 2 year old stayed at my house for those three days with explicit (nicely worded) instructions the house would be as clean when we got home from the hospital - we lived 2 hours away. It was and they were understanding when we asked them to leave for a while after we got home to settle in.

I loved having visitors, but I'm really outgoing. My sister stayed overnight for 3 days with her daughter and helped when he cried (so did my husband, he was off work for 2 weeks). She also helped me breastfeed. I was confused and forgot most everything the lactation consultant had taught me. So that was super helpful.

After that we were home a couple days by ourselves, then my mom stayed. She did dishes, cleaned the house, snuggled the baby, held my water cup while I breastfed (you get so thirsty, it's insane), and was overall super helpful during the day and night. She slept on the couch in the living room because we didn't have a spare room. She was great with me being in the living room and watching Netflix at 2 in the morning. 

My mom still sleeps over every Wednesday and watches our son on Thursdays.  I love it. She drives me crazy sometimes (asked why my house was dirty last week. Nearly punched her) but she's been so helpful.  It took a while for me to be upfront with her and explain what I did and didn't want her to do and what I did and didn't find helpful. After I could explain those things it got much easier.

That is only my experience. I felt like I had a lot of time with my son even though we had overnight guests sometimes. I'm in no way trying to sound rude, but i found the help invaluable.  

Maybe tell her that you want to wait and see how you feel before you have overnight guests? Or that you aren't comfortable having someone sleepover while the babies are so new? Or that you appreciate the offer, but maybe she could save overnights for times you guys feel especially exhausted?  Maybe only once in a while? 

Again, I feel like my experience is going to come off rude, and I really don't want it to! Everyone is different.

He kept pushing to &#39;stay close&#39; and trying to sleep with me, even flirting with me and pushing boundaries once we were both dating other people. Eventually I just had to stop talking to him entirely because he was acting like a scumbag to his new girlfriend and I was tired of putting up with his rubbish. I feel like if we hadn&#39;t tried to stay friends so close to the breakup maybe we could have stayed civil, but since we never took that time out it just made the whole thing impossible.</p>

Also, if you are charting, you can use that to help you pinpoint dates to start counting based on your O day.

The risk of eating raw sushi-grade salmon in a reputable restaurant is *very* small. The pleasure of eating sashimi can be very high. The nutritional benefits of salmon (even raw), is also high. 

Assessing risk is a personal endeavor. For me, that tiny risk is worth taking, given the right circumstances. I perceive the risk as small. So I take it.

You may not take that level of risk for other reasons.

And both decisions should be acceptable without guilt.

In the end, we have to assess what the possible outcomes are. More often than not, ""risk of food poisoning by bad fish at a sushi restaurant"" turns into something *much* more dire in the world of Pregnancy Folklore. Eating raw fish becomes equated with miscarriage, when in fact, the risk of contracting food borne illness has only a chance of miscarriage depending on the type of illness and severity.

The chance of being in a car accident in the US is higher than the chance that you'll catch listeria (the food borne illness that is problematic, though not always fatal for a fetus) from sushi-grade fish or deli meat (sources from Expecting Better). But we don't judge pregnant people for driving to work every day. 

Some of these rules have taken on mythic proportions of concern that in no way match the actual risk associated with the behavior.

The reason I'm so fired up about this topic is this:
When we start judging other pregnant people for their choices, we are assuming that a woman's behavior while pregnant has a *big* impact on the health of the their pregnancy. There is *no way* that you can judge a pregnant person for taking diet risks or other small risks w/o implying that their actions could *cause* miscarriage. 

BUT we are all in a ttcafterloss sub. We've all lost, and we've all gone through the guilt of wondering what we did wrong, and we've all l been told that *most* miscarriage is caused by a problem out of our control. We've all said and heard, ""oh honey, there's nothing you did to cause this."" And we believe it right up the the minute we are judging her for drinking a glass of wine, or her for drinking coffee, or her for eating sushi, or her for taking Tylenol, or her for staying on her SSRIs.
 
This kind of judgment keeps forcing miscarriage underground because women blame themselves, because women blame each other.

I'll get off my soap box now.

Edit to say one more thing: this kind of mindset not only keeps forcing miscarriage underground as a taboo topic, it also makes judgment of parenting behaviors acceptable. The risk I take in having my baby co-sleep/cloth diaper/sleep in a hammock/breastfeed exclusively/etc is calculated. I perceive the benefits to outweigh the risks, and I take necessary precautions to make the situation as safe as possible while creating my own family lifestyle. These choices are all relative.

Studies repeatedly show that alcohol *in moderation* do little to no harm. The choice isn't about wanting a drink so bad you'd risk the baby. 

Alcohol in moderation does not equal miscarriage or other complications.

There is a middle ground that doctors (especially in the US) don't discuss with patients for many complicated, and usually social, reasons (time restrictions with patients, misperceptions of intelligence, trust, etc).

The choice to have a glass of wine to sip with dinner is cultural and personal.

A glass at dinner will be processed by your liver as you drink it slowly. The alcohol passes through the liver before it goes to the blood stream. If your liver is working properly, and not overtaxed (by disease or overconsumption of alcohol) the alcohol will reach the blood stream in negligible amounts. That small amt that got into the blood stream may pass through the placenta, but it gets processed by the placenta. If there is an excess that the placenta can't handle, the baby's liver starts to process (depending on what week gestation you are at). 

Honestly, there's a likelihood that the jolt and candy bar people eat before ultrasounds to get the baby moving can cause more damage (in utero babies cannot process glucose as adults can - hence the fears of gestational diabetes).

Each risk is complicated, and each person needs to assess their own risk in their own way without fear of being labeled as uncaring, unloving, or a bad mom by those who have made different choices for different reasons.

I'm not saying to ignore rules. I'm saying it makes sense that one set of restrictive rules is not necessarily the best for all women.

For example, I drink caffeine. I sometimes have 1/2 a small mug of coffee in the mornings, and occasionally a coke or chocolate. I have terrible headaches that are relieved by caffeine. Should I take the infinitesimal risk of ingesting caffeine, or admit defeat, spent two days in bed incapacitated by stress and pain?

I saw two guys reading the bus schedule on the wall when I arrived. One of the guys seemed a bit frail; he was older and had a cane. I didn't really do much more than register their presence then sat down to wait for my bus. 
  
I heard a bit of a commotion and looked up and saw the younger guy struggling to help the older guy sit. They were at the other end of the platform, but I got worried that the old guy was going to break his hip or something so I got up and started trotting towards them to help. The younger guy manged to get him seated as I was close, and I made small talk saying that I was coming over to see if they needed an extra hand, as I was obviously running towards them and felt kind of awkward when they turned out to be fine. 
  
The younger guy said he actually did need help with the schedule, and said that he couldn't figure out which bus to take. I went to the schedule with him and he told me where he was going and which bus he thought he needed to take. I pointed at the right one and he said something like I'm having trouble figuring that out. Eventually I just used google maps on my phone and he was happy and went on his way and hopefully got wherever he was going. 
  
I sat to wait for my bus, and this little old asian guy came up to me, and said that I was very kind, and that he wanted to give me a gift, while holding out his bus pass to me. Of course I was like, no! Keep your pass! But he said that it was a day pass and he was finished with it! So I took it and used it to get on the bus. I'd never used a day pass, so I kind of fumbled with where to scan it, and while telling me what to do, the bus driver joked that he was happy that I'd brought him a snack (I had a box of leftover pizza, I went out for lunch.) I told him what it was and told him he could have it, that I was full but I hate to waste food. He said he was just joking but that he knew a guy who could use it. I gave it to him and sat down to wait for the bus to leave (it waits a few minutes at the terminal.) This kind of scruffy looking old guy got on, didn't pay fare, and addressed the driver by name. The driver asked him if he'd eaten, the guy said not yet he was waiting till later, and the driver told him that he had something for him and gave him the pizza. The old guy seemed so happy! He made the best laugh and thanked the driver really enthusiastically. I felt really good :)  
  
Anyhoo, bus starts leaving the terminal and a guy was running after the bus. The driver stops and let's him on, guy scans his card, and it doesn't work. Eventually the driver tells him he's sorry but the guy will have to get off. The guy looked so sad, and was begging the driver to let him stay on because he was late for work, and the driver was being nice but firm. I figured I'd essentially gotten on for free, so I tapped my regular card and paid for the guy. He seemed really relieved, and I hoped that his day went better after that! 
  
4 women ahead of me were counting change, and I figured I'd ask them if they wanted to have the bus pass from the Asian guy in case the were counting change for a transfer. (We pay on each bus here if you pay cash.) I offered it to them and explained what it was, and eventually one of the women (I think they might have been Filipinas) got it and pointed at the change and was like ""not enough!"" I hope I saved them some heartache :) 
  
Sometimes I forget how nice it is to just give.

&nbsp;
I had a natural miscarriage at 8+5 and didn't bleed for very long either; I wasn't even wearing a liner 7 days afterwards, I think. Cramps were totally manageable as I was able to take ibuprofen (silver lining of a MC, right?)

&nbsp;
We chose to wait one cycle before TTC again, as I'd had a chicken pox & rubella booster a few weeks after the MC. I also used to have an IUD, so using condoms for that first month felt really weird for us too. It felt like I was about 10 years younger, and not in a good way...

&nbsp;
I believe that most care providers recommend waiting a cycle so a future pregnancy can be correctly dated, so if that's the only reason for you to ""wait"" then you probably don't need to. However if you had excess bleeding, or any additional complications, it may be best to wait to TTC until after your next period. I'd have a conversation with the midwife to see what her thoughts on your situation are.

&nbsp;
It took longer for my hCG levels to drop than I thought it would, so I think it would be prudent to prepare yourself for that. I don't know what my levels were the day of my MC, but 4 days later they were 1967(March 9/15). I was tested over the following weeks & my last draw was still 23.4(March 30/15). I started my next period on April 2. I'm fairly confident I didn't ovulate that first cycle, but don't use OPKs and temps were wacky, so ???

&nbsp;
I also experienced some INSANE rebound sadness quite recently. Of course I was sad in the immediate MC period, but felt like was able to move through my grief relatively quickly. But... I found the time period when I would have started to feel the baby move (~18-20 weeks) really hard, especially as it happened to fall around Mother's Day.

That charity is amazing. It was so worth it, they do wonderful work.

In TTC news, CD5 and spotting for two days. Unusual for me, usually heavy for 3-4 days, so going to schedule an appointment with my GP to ask for some hormone testing.

The main reasons for the month wait are mostly the same as if one had given birth at full-term, with a few other things happening:

- Nothing in the vagina for about 4 weeks, as the cervix will be open for a while and you could get an infection of the uterus. That's why they say no baths, sex, etc.

- So hormone levels can drop and you have a period before conceiving, important for the body's hormone levels and the lining of the uterus.

- So you have some time to process and go through the hormone changes that will happen this month. 

- So you can go through a grieving process (important for mental health during your next pregnancy as well).

I wouldn't say it would be irresponsible to have sex, so long as you know your cervix is closed and the risk of infection has passed. My husband and I use the pull-out method, as I could never stand condoms either.

OH!! Big news! I've lost 15 pounds since February! I've been trying to cook homemade meals every single day for every single meal and cut out all grains, dairy, and sugars (basically Paleo without the mentality of ""eat like caveman!""). I've actually gotten pretty decent at cooking and my husband loves everything I cook. I couldn't feel happier. 

My mom, who is such an amazing cook herself and homemade all of my meals as a kid, paid me the biggest compliment the other day when I had her over for dinner. She said that my food was so delicious and that ""you have turned into such an amazing cook, mrswaka; you're much better than I ever was!"" We totally went back and forth on her last comment, but I honestly admire her so much that this made me cry :) 

Update: I talked to my boss. Told him ""I can't do this commute"" and then apologized a million trillion times. He looked like he was going to cry and just gave me a weak smile and said ""it's okay...it's....okay."" He also told me that he's had employees trying to make the same commute before and it doesn't work out because it's such a hard drive. Anyway, ugh, that felt really horrible. But I'm glad I did it. I put it in so my last day is next Friday so I'll finally have a weekend off. Plus, he wasn't going to give me time off for my graduation ceremony or my one year wedding anniversary...so I kind of dodged a bullet there.

It seems to me that you ""need"" multiple kinds of carriers depending on your goals. There is no one carrier to rule them all. 

A soft stretchy wrap (Moby or k'tan) is great for newborns, but get too stretchy/unsafe once baby gets heavier. 

Ring slings are also great for newborns, and can last much longer, but maybe aren't best for fidgety children, or for long days out. You can find tons of these in different fabrics (lightweight, heavier, depending on weather you anticipate, etc) on Etsy.

Mei Tai carriers are adaptable so anyone of any size can wear it. They are great for newborns through toddlers...depending on how heavy and tall the kid gets. Babyhawk is a popular brand for Mei Tais.

Soft structured carriers (Ergo, Bjorn, lillebaby, Beco, Tula, Boba, Onya, etc) have a variety of different features. Things that are important to me are padded straps, crossover straps, back-carry, infant compatibility, a hood, and a wide waistband. The Tula is popular at cult-like proportions. The Onya gets amazing reviews, but is less well known. The Ergo and Bjorn are widely available, and so popular by default, but I think you can do better. (I decided on the Beco Soleil.) Google ""soft structured baby carrier comparusons"" to get a sense of features, and what might be important to you. 

Wraps are for the more advanced. And not any old piece of fabric will do. The weave is important. I plan to get a wrap or two later on once I feel more comfortable.

I've posted in /r/babywearing, and asked  people there questions, and was strongly encouraged to go to meetings no matter how far along you are. They bring dolls to practice with for those who are still wearing their babies on the inside.

I have a baby shower tomorrow for 2 friends that are both due in June. All my friends and I met at a mother baby group so our first kids are all the same age (around 21 months). There's 2 moms that already have baby #2, 3 moms due this month, and 2 due later this year. My SIL is also pregnant and due in June.

The other moms in the group are waiting before trying for #2. I'm the only one that wants a second but can't get there. We tried for 8 months and then had a miscarriage. 

It's been surprisingly difficult to get over. I've gained 5 lbs in 2 weeks because I can't control my eating when I'm upset. 

I'm not sure why I'm posting exactly. I've been trying not to think about it but with so many pregnancies around me it's impossible. Maybe it's not the right strategy anyway.

I had a hair appointment scheduled this morning, the first since the miscarriage.  I was not looking forward to showing up without the cute bump they expected me to have by now, so I decided I'd test this morning at 10 DPO in hopes maybe I'd have good news to offset that.  Nope.

I had a hair appointment scheduled this morning, the first since the miscarriage.  I was not looking forward to showing up without the cute bump they expected me to have by now, so I decided I&#39;d test this morning at 10 DPO in hopes maybe I&#39;d have good news to offset that.  Nope.  BFN.  I was so hopeful this month.  I know I&#39;m not really out of the running yet; it&#39;s still early, but I just feel so defeated.

Original post:

I can't find the alum thread for today (30 may) so I'm posting here.

I have my anatomy scan in 30m. I'm *freaking out* and need some reassurance.

I'm not finding out the sex, so this appt doesn't have the fun reveal everyone else focuses on. I'm terrified we'll find something wrong, and I'll have to start thinking about tfmr. It's all I can think about. I know the stats, but I also know the stats feel great until you fall on the wrong side of the fence.

It feels so bad. I can't imagine now, at my age, going through labor for tfmr, then trying again. I can't do it. 

All I can feel is terror at the prospect of what might come in the next few weeks, and utter rage at every pregnant woman asking how much Jolt and coffee they should drink before this scan to get a good look at baby's junk. I've seen at least 10 pregnant women so far this morning (wtf, do they all come out at 6am on Saturdays!?!) and I want to strangle them all.

I feel like I'm going to explode or scream or throw something.",[],,t1_crpu78c,False,0,[],False,"<div class=""md""><p>UPDATE: anatomy scan went really well.

If you Google the sperm meets egg plan it explains it better than I can. I didn't order the book, just read snippets on blogs and stuff. I think you start on cd 8, bd everyother day until your fertile window, and then bd everyday, then a couple days after ovulation too.

The first two months of trying we stopped bd the the day after my positive opk. Turns out, I was ovulating late. I should've been more diligent on checking cm. When I did, we got pregnant with my current pregnancy (12+5 and paranoid). 

Def read about the sperm meets egg plan, but mostly listen to your body. Check for the cues you're already planning to check. And if the first cycle ttc is too hard,  it's ok to wait. And it's ok to have your plan and stick to it. When we started ttc again I cried. I felt stupid, but my husband was there for me because we experienced our loss together.

We were building our family with a second daughter and still hadn&#39;t told anyone on Facebook that we had a family at all (lame dream component I know) and I was feeling guilty for not being proud of this family I had by other means. Anyway, interesting dream.</p>

I can feel this baby moving constantly, flipping and kicking and hiccuping.... and all I can think about is Hanna and what I never got to have with her. I love this new baby so much and am literally counting down the days until his arrival... but damnit I also want my fucking daughter back. 

I just can't stop wondering what if the doctors were wrong, what if I made a horrible, horrible mistake? I have never felt this way since August, so these doubts are really upsetting for me. The fact that we were never able to get the name of her diagnosis is really upsetting me suddenly. I mean, the doctors were very upfront and honest about her ultrasound findings (absent long bones in her arms and legs, a  rib cage too narrow to support lung + heart development, cysts and abnormalities in her brain) and what that meant for any possibility of life or it's quality. We were told thanatoporic dysplasia, then osteogenesis imperfecta, microdeletions, etc.. maybe this maybe that. But our genetic testing was inconclusive, and wholly normal even down to a perfect microarray. I've spent the better part of the past few days obsessively searching for birth stories of moms who had skeletal dysplasia diagnoses and their outcomes... it ranges from 'the baby was perfectly fine and the doctors were wrong!' to stillbirth, and to the absolute worst outcome ever- the baby living with zero quality of life and entirely medically dependent. Unfortunately there are over 300 types of SD, and they all have vastly varying degrees in severity. Also, many are not understood, never diagnosed by name, and some haven't even been researched really at all. It is not uncommon to not be able to identify the exact cause, at least not very easily. The SD institute in CA is backlogged years with genetic material from diagnosed babies, compassionately trying to find diagnoses for parents.

My MFM doctors and OBs were confident that this was going to be fatal, and that there was a very rare chance the baby would be able to survive with a ventilator if the rib cage expanded and heart and lungs developed more before the pregnancy ended... but even if the measurements were off or the thorax grew adequately I know there was still no mistaking the absent bones, and would I really want my baby to be born limbless, and entirely dependent for her entire life to be fed, bathed, toileted, etc? What would happen to her if my husband and I died? Would I try to have more kids in the hope that I am providing her lifelong caregivers, and could I saddle my other children with that burden?

But then I go back to, what if there was a mistake? What if even despite all this testing and doctors what if there was some kind of miracle and she was going to be born healthy and I stopped it?

I've been a wreck over this... I got into a huge fight with my husband today (admittedly he screwed up, but it was more like a 5/10 screw up and I treated it like a 10/10) and then spent 4 hours on the couch bawling my eyes out and napping. I don't know how to talk to him about this or bring it up with him, which is hard too because we are super open and normally great communicators, and I've never had a hard time talking to him about this before.

To be honest, I couldn't handle any Mommy-groups on Facebook or online or whatever when I was pregnant. To put it kindly, many were lacking common sense. 

I remember I was reading through one, and some lady was asking how on earth she got her 2 year old to stop nursing, because he kept coming up and taking them out and just helping himself. And I shit you not, the replies from other Moms were ""tape up your nipples so he can't get any milk"". I needed a break from the internet for a while after that. 

Just remember that half of the planet is below average. Think of the most average intelligence person you know, and know that half of the world is below that. I find that comforts me, haha. 

Sorry you are having a grouchy day, lots of hugs and feel better soon.

Been feeling kind of woozy all last night and a bit this morning. Starting to think maybe it's dehydration from the MS. Woke up shrieking again in the middle of the night last night over god knows what, and all in all got barely any sleep. Still a bit sore from my fall, plus I'm also itchy all over thanks to my dermatologist and the heat.

I'm feeling bummed because I was due to go to a ballet show with my husband this afternoon but had to cancel at the last minute when I could tell I wasn't going to be up to it. Thought I would use the opportunity to check out the January 2016 mother's group I joined. Was really NOT impressed.

Firstly, so much arrogance and presumption I could choke on it. One girl just printed out a giant certificate for her parents awarding them an 'upgrade to grandparents' and reminding them that 'only the very best parents get upgraded to grandparent status'. I'm like bitch, please. What the fuck does that make my parents after my miscarriage and the parents of everyone battling infertility? The quality of their parenting means jack shit to biology, trust me.

Meanwhile both her and other people are going out and buying truckloads of maternity gear and crib furniture and making all these fancy public announcements and I just want to warn them and say for god's sakes, calm your jets. I'm also due on the 1st of Jan, so bear in mind all of these women are 1-4 weeks behind me, and I'm only 8 weeks. 

So...yeah. Now I'm just feeling bitter that all I can think of is getting over this hump and somehow avoiding another miscarriage while all these clueless women prance around with no possible comprehension that everything could come crashing down in a moment. I know logically it's better for them to celebrate every minute and bla bla bla, but damn it if it doesn't hurt knowing that I'll never be so naive and innocent again.

If cycles are becoming shorter, but ovulation day is the same (assuming you have a temp spike and are ovulating)  I would be thinking you may have a shorter luteal phase (LP), which can indicate, among other things, progesterone deficency and may not allow a fertilised egg time to implant properly.  However with a 25D cycle and ovulation day of 12-13, you should have a LP of 12-13 days which is fine.

As lutinising hormone (LH) is what makes the OPK positive, you may naturally (assuming temp spikes occur and you are ovulating)  have lower levels of LH also --> this may not necessarily be a problem.

In short, if you are ovulating dpo 12-13 and have a 25 day cycle, you have a LP of 12-13 days --> this is ok for implantation, but I would probably get progesterone levels checked in case.  You may also want to get LH levels checked as this is what gears up and prompts the egg to be released.

Not sure: periods are becoming shorter (down to 4 days instead of 7) and tend to stop for a day and then start again. Ovulation day is the same (12-13dpo). Opk's still showing strong lines (although neg) all through cycle, no idea if that matters or not. 

Does any of that mean a thing? 

Unfortunately this last cycle I didn't do much tracking aside from ovulation day and menstrual cycle. 


>But anyway, I don't think a shift to shorter-than-usual cycles tends to be a problem in most cases as long as you don't have a LPD and eggs are ripening nicely. 

Ah alright, thanks for the help!

<p>Not sure: periods are becoming shorter (down to 4 days instead of 7) and tend to stop for a day and then start again. Ovulation day is the same (12-13dpo). Opk&#39;s still showing strong lines (although neg) all through cycle, no idea if that matters or not. </p>

**Seeing the RE:**

*Pros*

* They will do the testing quicker (rather than waiting for another six months)

* They can do more in-depth testing

* They will actually look at and care about my chart (they said so on their site!)

* I might be able to get in quicker

* We've been trying for long enough and this is what they specialize in

*Cons*

* It would cost a shitton

* I might not be able to get in for a while


**See the OB/GYN:**

*Pros*

* It might be cheaper

* He might be able to do some of the procedures at his office

*Cons*

* It's a month and a half away

* He can only do so much testing before I have to go to an RE anyways

* He can't do as many tests

* He will be more likely to ignore my charts and push for me to keep trying naturally for longer

Well exercise in particular.  Lifting heavy weights is very important to keeping me mentally happy and physically fit.  It also stops me from getting back pain as I have a mild scoliosis.  Monday was my first training session since I was undeniably pregnant and I backed off a little.  I knew I was doing it, but gave myself a little leeway.  Just told my trainer I was feeling a bit off colour.  Today, the uterine stretching (which I have been embracing as a reassurance) is a little more intense and I have called in sick for training.  Cause, you know, I might somehow turn this into my period?? 

I know in no way did exercise contribute to my MC, but I am petrified of all absurd risks. Last time my OB was more than happy for me to continue to lift very heavy (we're talking 100kg deadlifts etc) in fact he was encouraging it, just don't over heat.

After Monday I posted in /r/fitpregnancy to hopefully get some advice from the ladies there on how to overcome my mental block, I got one ok reply, but the second one was of a lady who told me she is an avid excerciser but is now in pre-term labour on bed rest.  While I feel for her this was not helpful to me.

It doesn't help that due to work I have not had a chance to re-google how normal cramping without bleeding is normal (which I will promptly go and do.
The lines on my pee sticks are getting darker and quicker, I am intermittently dizzy, my temps are nice and high and couldn't eat chocolate last night, so I know at this moment I should be good.  Went to the Dr this am for bloods and she has given me path requests for serial betas, so there will be some reassurance there (no phone call with results tonight unfortunately).

Lifting heavy weights is very important to keeping me mentally happy and physically fit.  It also stops me from getting back pain as I have a mild scoliosis.  Monday was my first training session since I was undeniably pregnant and I backed off a little.  I knew I was doing it, but gave myself a little leeway.  Just told my trainer I was feeling a bit off colour.  Today, the uterine stretching (which I have been embracing as a reassurance) is a little more intense and I have called in sick for training.  Cause, you know, I might somehow turn this into my period?? </p>

<p>I know in no way did exercise contribute to my MC, but I am petrified of all absurd risks. Last time my OB was more than happy for me to continue to lift very heavy (we&#39;re talking 100kg deadlifts etc) in fact he was encouraging it, just don&#39;t over heat.</p>

<p>After Monday I posted in <a href=""/r/fitpregnancy"">/r/fitpregnancy</a> to hopefully get some advice from the ladies there on how to overcome my mental block, I got one ok reply, but the second one was of a lady who told me she is an avid excerciser but is now in pre-term labour on bed rest.  While I feel for her this was not helpful to me.</p>

<p>It doesn&#39;t help that due to work I have not had a chance to re-google how normal cramping without bleeding is normal (which I will promptly go and do.
The lines on my pee sticks are getting darker and quicker, I am intermittently dizzy, my temps are nice and high and couldn&#39;t eat chocolate last night, so I know at this moment I should be good.  Went to the Dr this am for bloods and she has given me path requests for serial betas, so there will be some reassurance there (no phone call with results tonight unfortunately).</p>

<p>I just wish I could over come this block with exercise.  Does anyone here lift/exercise a lot? Anyone able to provide me with some anecdotal inspiration?</p>

I'm so sorry that you've lost your baby, and that you've had to go through this awful experience.
  
You've been through a lot, and it's very normal to feel a bit out of sorts for a while after your miscarriage. On top of that, you've had a lot to deal with school, and changing jobs and all the stress that comes with these things. 
  
If you have conceived, it *will* work out. Babies have been conceived in all kinds of stressful and unstable situations. Your baby will be loved and wanted and you sound lik you are well equipped to make things work out.
  
If you haven't conceived this month, you will have a bit more time to make a decision on what you will do next cycle. Maybe you'll decide to put ttc on hold, maybe you'll decide that it's worth it to continue. 
  
Either way, we are here for you! Take care of yourself and let us know how things go. <3

I can relate to how you are feeling about regretting and wondering if now is the right time, and those feelings conflicting with wanting to have a family and get back all those hopes and dreams.

It isn't easy. Just know it is okay to take a breath and give yourself a day on the couch or whatever and not think about it. Think in little bits at a time (hard, I know), and I recommend making decisions when you are feeling more up rather than down. 

I'm sorry you are having such a hard time and just know your thoughts and feelings are normal in these circumstances.

Two MC's, 2013 and early 2014 respectively. Both pregnancies were unplanned but wanted. 

Pregnant with my son in March of 2014 on first cycle of TTC.

Gave birth to him in Dec. 2014. 

He died at 8 days old. Suddenly became sick at 5 days old from bacterial meningitis. Was completely brain dead by day 6. Took him off life support on day 8. 

We began TTC soon after. I am on cycle 4.
