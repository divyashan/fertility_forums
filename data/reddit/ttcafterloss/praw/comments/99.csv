But at 14 DPO my boobs weren‚Äôt quite as sore. Finally took a test yesterday morning at 15 DPO and sure enough there‚Äôs the faintest of lines on the FRER and basically nothing on the cheapie (easy@home). 

Took another cheapie in the evening and it is ever so slightly darker, and I know it‚Äôs probably because my body is processing whatever HCG is left in there...but I can‚Äôt help but hold onto this tiny hope that maybe, MAYBE I actually ovulated later, implanted later and I just have slow-rising HCG.

I had my suspicions that sperm met egg when I had a sudden sustained temp rise and the timing of the more reliable pregnancy symptoms towards the end of the TWW. 11-13 DPO I was having some definite nausea, peeing frequently, insanely sore boobs. But at 14 DPO my boobs weren‚Äôt quite as sore. Finally took a test yesterday morning at 15 DPO and sure enough there‚Äôs the faintest of lines on the FRER and basically nothing on the cheapie (easy@home). </p>

<p>Took another cheapie in the evening and it is ever so slightly darker, and I know it‚Äôs probably because my body is processing whatever HCG is left in there...but I can‚Äôt help but hold onto this tiny hope that maybe, MAYBE I actually ovulated later, implanted later and I just have slow-rising HCG.

I am not sure if you are comfortable but if you are you can share you had four pregnancy losses. Most people are considerate enough to avoid pregnancy topic around you if they know you had losses.

So I recently did IVF due to my low AMH (0.53). 

When we discovered it, I was reminded that we CAN still conceive. My RE said my odds each month were still about the same right then, just that I‚Äôd run out of time/that wouldn‚Äôt be true for me more quickly.  

We were told that we can try without assistance for a bit (suggested 4-6 cycles max), then move to pills (max 6 months), then move on more if we still need to...but just not to linger on any one option ‚Äútoo long‚Äù or we‚Äôd be ‚Äúwasting time.‚Äù

BUT ALSO it could correlate to your losses. There‚Äôs no way to know how your eggs are without IVF. My doctors guessed my eggs were bad but during IVF they did really well and everyone was surprised. 

If this is your first time having this test done, it‚Äôs hard to say how quickly your AMH is dropping. Could be fast or slow, but it IS early (on average). 

Have you had a CD3 ultrasound to check your antrifollicle count? Or tested FSH?  How about vitamin D?

Even with a lower AMH, if your AFC is still decent you have better odds. My AMH would have suggested a low AFC but it was 9 and everyone was excited about that. 

If your FSH is normal, you‚Äôre more likely to respond to stimulating hormones, which is a good thing, too. If your FSH is high along with low AMH, I‚Äôd recommend more/sooner intervention. 

And if your vitamin D is low, it could be falsely lowering your AMH. 

If you have any type of good coverage for fertility, explore that sooner rather than later. Especially if you hope to have more than 1 child. 

Best advice I have: see a RE. Very soon. OBs aren‚Äôt in the business of getting people pregnant ‚Äî REs are.

Have you had a karyotype done? Or vit d tested? Have you had a follicle count? 

A few things that helped me: 

* I read (somewhere) that age was one of the strongest predictors of IVF success, so at 31 it seems your odds should still be decent.

* Reviewing the hunger games data on the /r/infertility subreddit gave me a sense of what to expect from an IVF cycle in terms of eggs and quality based on others with similar AMH and folicles counts.

<p>A few things that helped me: </p>

<ul>
<li><p>I read (somewhere) that age was one of the strongest predictors of IVF success, so at 31 it seems your odds should still be decent.</p></li>
<li><p>Reviewing the hunger games data on the <a href=""/r/infertility"">/r/infertility</a> subreddit gave me a sense of what to expect from an IVF cycle in terms of eggs and quality based on others with similar AMH and folicles counts.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>We meet with the RE next week to talk options but she&#39;s already suggesting IVF. That rocked my world because since we had no issue getting pregnant I didn&#39;t think that was likely to be our path. üò≥</p>

<p>When I first got the news I feeling pretty defective, frustrated, confused and alone as most of our friends are having no problem. In the last few weeks as we&#39;ve done more testing I&#39;ve come to be more at peace with it and an feeling ready to face what&#39;s next. It&#39;s a super personal journey though. </p>

<p>Feel free to DM or start a chat if you want to talk more. You&#39;re def not alone. ‚ù§Ô∏è</p>

<p>Thank you for all the information and for listening to me ramble. I truly have nowhere else to put these feelings and it&#39;s all really confusing.</p>

I just wanted to share my story, because I can‚Äôt get over it and I‚Äôm very heartbroken. 

I‚Äôve had an ectopic pregnancy in the end of March and I‚Äôve lost the baby and my right Fallopian tube on 6th of April. What is funny - I ovulated out of my left ovary, but stupid right tube caught the egg and got all tangled behind my uterus. After the surgery I‚Äôve been told that my other tube looks great and we should have no problem getting pregnant again. However she said ‚Äúif you are not pregnant in 6 months, let‚Äôs check if your tube is blocked‚Äù. Ugh also important to mention - while I was going through this, my husband was in a psychiatric hospital as he had a nervous breakdown because of COVID. So I had to go through all this alone.

So come end of August, my period is late and I get a really faint positive line on hpt. We‚Äôre so excited, only took us three cycles to get pregnant again. However the line was not progressing as well as I wanted it to and I also I‚Äôve been spotting since the day of my expected period. 

I have called my local clinic and they say ‚Äúsorry, but nobody is gonna see you until 8 weeks, we‚Äôll schedule an appointment with a midwife‚Äù. Well thanks, but I‚Äôm spotting now and have a pain on my left side, so I‚Äôd prefer to be seen ASAP.

<p>I just wanted to share my story, because I can‚Äôt get over it and I‚Äôm very heartbroken. </p>

<p>I‚Äôve had an ectopic pregnancy in the end of March and I‚Äôve lost the baby and my right Fallopian tube on 6th of April. What is funny - I ovulated out of my left ovary, but stupid right tube caught the egg and got all tangled behind my uterus. After the surgery I‚Äôve been told that my other tube looks great and we should have no problem getting pregnant again. However she said ‚Äúif you are not pregnant in 6 months, let‚Äôs check if your tube is blocked‚Äù. Ugh also important to mention - while I was going through this, my husband was in a psychiatric hospital as he had a nervous breakdown because of COVID. So I had to go through all this alone.</p>

<p>So come end of August, my period is late and I get a really faint positive line on hpt. We‚Äôre so excited, only took us three cycles to get pregnant again. However the line was not progressing as well as I wanted it to and I also I‚Äôve been spotting since the day of my expected period. </p>

<p>I have called my local clinic and they say ‚Äúsorry, but nobody is gonna see you until 8 weeks, we‚Äôll schedule an appointment with a midwife‚Äù. Well thanks, but I‚Äôm spotting now and have a pain on my left side, so I‚Äôd prefer to be seen ASAP. But well, thanks to our stupid healthcare system, nobody even sends me to get my hcg levels tested. I had to call the Gynecology department in the hospital the next day since I started bleeding heavily. Finally they agreed to see me and get my blood tested. </p>

I laugh when people who haven&#39;t yet started trying say things like &quot;Well, I&#39;m going to get pregnant in X month so we can have the baby in Z month, and then exactly two years later we&#39;ll have our second, and I&#39;m going to have one boy and one girl.&quot; Like...okay! Good luck with that! I don&#39;t take anything for granted.</p>

Your thyroid status definitely does impact your ability to conceive - it impacts the whole ovulation cycle, in fact - and an uncontrolled thyroid level it is a risk factor in having miscarriages.

Primary care can sometimes be a shot in the dark as to their familiarity level with managing thyroid disease, but if you're wanting to start this process sooner it couldn't hurt to ask.

Also, heads up if you do get pregnant - get your TSH checked pretty quick. I'm sure a PCP or OBGYN would run this for you, no question. You'll need more thyroid meds while pregnant most likely.

WTF is with all the different recommendations? Well, first thing is that if you get into your second trimester, there is evidence that waiting a bit before your next pregnancy can be helpful for better outcomes on the next one. If your miscarriage was first trimester, the old wisdom was to wait 3 months because your body needed to ""get back to normal"" or something. There was never any physical definition of what ""normal"" is or that waiting that time was helpful. Recent evidence from the last 10 years or so supports the idea that women in developed countries with access to good nutrition and healthcare have no good reason to wait to conceive after a first trimester loss. The reason the WHO recommends 6 months and will likely never change that recommendation is that this recommendation is for use by the whole world, and their claim is that women in developing countries without access to regular healthcare and good nutrition are at risk for bad outcomes in a second pregnancy if they don't wait because of folate levels that may be depleted by the miscarried fetus.

Edit to add: This was my impression after reading the literature, but my OB at my last appointment confirmed that this is an accurate view of the current landscape of TTC after loss recommendations.

Edit to add: Also the wait for your first period this is about being able to date your next pregnancy. If you know your O-date, you can still date it, so if you're tracking don't worry about waiting for your first period either.

TLDR: doctors with more recent educations or who keep up with recent literature recommend that you can start trying again as soon as you're emotionally ready after a first trimester loss. Those with older educations may suggest 3 months. If your loss was later, there may be good reason to wait also.",[],,t1_g4hizud,False,0,[],False,"<div class=""md""><p>So, I read a lot about this after my MMC because I&#39;m like you.

I know it's very easy to feel stressed, but it's normal, although that doesn't make it any easier...!

I'm guessing you had surgery for your loss?  If your periods returned afterwards, and your cycles are regular, with ovulation each time, it's most likely everything is absolutely fine.  If you are still concerned, there are some tests that can be run in terms of hormonal profiles, examination of tubes/uterus etc, but I think if you're just going into your third attempt post loss it's probably a *little* early unless you have any signs/symptoms that something might be awry.

If still no luck at six cycles, then maybe you could ask your doctor for some reassurance and see what they can offer you, although up to a year is considered normal xx

EDIT: I also know it *seems* like everyone is getting pregnant quickly, but Reddit is just a tiny microcosm.  All over the world there will be tens of thousands of women in your exact situation, who experienced a loss the same month you did, and are still trying now.

There is absolutely no reason to think from this that anything at all went wrong with your body during the procedure.

Your doctor is probably trying to just remain neutral in terms of not giving you any clear stance, but I think it's pretty well established now that there is no particularly raised threat to pregnant women provided they follow the same safety precautions as everyone else.

If your husband won't budge, is there anything you can do during this time that fits with your plans and could help you relax as in giving you some stats around your fertility?

Based on how far along you would be this would be impossible for implantation cramps, unfortunately. It definitely is a real thing though but I wouldn't really expect it to be possible outside of the 7-12 dpo window. Some women feel it more around the time their period is due, then it's probably a more delayed version or just early pregnancy cramps. Because implantation doesn't usually happen that late. For me, I actually feel implantation as it happens, right in the middle of the window when it's most likely to happen.",[],,t1_g49dcv9,False,0,[],False,"<div class=""md""><p>Yes, I 100% feel implantation cramping every time I get pregnant. It&#39;s so strong and unique, it&#39;s unmistakable for me. With my current pregnancy (that I&#39;m bleeding from and totally expect a third MC at 6 weeks), I felt it when I was 8 dpo. It&#39;s a pulling, tugging sensation, on the lower side of my uterus. It&#39;s not a generalised cramping, more like a piercing feeling in one spot. The next day at 9 dpo I had a light positive pregnancy test.  </p>

Not OP but unfortunately have had three losses, one natural. I opted for a D&C twice. At an early loss, a D&C while serious because of anesthesia is a relatively minor operation.

Not to get too graphic but they dilate your cervix just slightly and suction out the contents. If needed they may use a slightly sharper instrument to scrape your uterine lining, but its not a major procedure and you can literally go about your day a few hours later with only some period like cramping. There are of course risks of complications (scarring, which is rare, even though there are horror stories online) but there are also complications for other methods, including infection. I chose the d&c twice because my body was clearly not able to recognize the loss and I had no idea how long it would take, and honestly natural miscarriage is traumatic as well, and can be painful. Plus with a d&c you can test the genetic tissue.

Not saying you should go that route, just providing a perspective. I was able to get my pregnant again right away after my last d&c and am now 25 weeks.

It was an extremely rough day. I broke down hard. And I hated it because I was also so happy for them. I knew that she and her husband were trying too and they‚Äôre great parents. I really couldn‚Äôt think of anyone I would be happier for. But it was so close to home and it hurt so bad. Now for the rest of my life I get to watch this baby grow and hit all the milestones that our baby never will. Ugh. Yeah I‚Äôm still not over it. üòû</p>

I have my follow-up today, so I can report back after, but we&#39;re going to be trying again as soon as possible.</p>

I definitely echo the great posts you've already received in that temping should really only be viewed as a tool to confirm ovulation.  Once you've done that by seeing the four or five higher temperatures, then anything else is just icing on the cake.

Everything concerning temping/testing experiences are obviously anecdotal, but my temperatures are still super high today, but I've had a negative test yesterday and today at 13 and 14DPO.  Unfortunately progesterone can just be a troll and ultimately it doesn't really matter what your chart looks like so long as it facilitates you with confirming O.  As other posters have said, having a pretty/perfect charts doesn't really mean anything more than it looks pretty/perfect.

I also had a cycle where I decided to start testing early so I could 'get used to seeing a negative test' and I found it worse for my mental health.  Now I try and wait until I'm at least 12DPO or later, because any result from then is generally considered pretty accurate.

To try and offer some advice, I don't know if this mindset would help, but I try and think of it as - it doesn't really matter *how late* I test; if I'm pregnant, that will be the case, and if I'm not, that will be the case also.  Temping, charting, testing...it's all just information, it can't change biologically what is happening inside your body for that cycle if you've put egg and sperm together.

Yes, I totally understand the 'doing something new' = having some control mindset.  It sounds like you have a really supportive doctor though, so I'm sure they would be quick to move you onto the next option if the medicated cycles don't work out. 

And absolutely agree, it's really hard to think of anything else but this.  I think it would be easier if I had a really fast-paced job that I was passionate about, but unfortunately that's not the case.  I'm supremely lucky in that my employer is very supportive of what I've been through, and I've been WFH for pretty much for the whole year to date, but I feel guilty taking advantage of that as my current role isn't really advancing my aspirations at all, and if I stay here too long I'm going to stagnate.  I have some applications in atm, so crossing my fingers that one of those works out.

This year started off so positively for me, but now I feel like it's cursed.

I said to my husband last night in bed, if a meteor came down right now and obliterated us and our cats - provided we were all wiped out instantaneously and painlessly - I would welcome it.

I know that this is a pathetic mindset, and I am hoping that I can break out of it soon.

I had MC at 9 weeks. Apparently the first day of bleeding counts roughly as CD1, so I started using OPK again at CD10, although this time I tested twice per day to try and make sure I caught the ovulation window incase it was shorter than usual. I didn't ovulate until CD28.

I got positives and it looks like my LH surge lasted around 36 hours which is still good, but I mainly wanted to have peace of mind to know i could ovulate again and have a rough idea when to expect my period rather than any more surprise bleeding.

My son‚Äôs ceremony is coming up. I‚Äôm scared but it‚Äôs so much better to have a ‚Äúto-do‚Äù list for him. I have to make a meal for us all to share. We also will make a spirit plate to feed our ancestors and my unborn son. I gotta get flags (cloth that we tie up in the sweat). I gotta prepare something to be buried.

Something I wanted to offer to anyone, because I know sweat lodges are very hard to come by, is that you can also prepare hot baths with herbs for cleansing yourself too. In my culture we use sage and sweetgrass to cleanse but there are lots of different options outside of native culture too. Rose, salt, lavender, rosemary, cedar, etc etc. Preparing something to cleanse yourself ritually is something many cultures offer to women after loss or birth too. I‚Äôve certainly done herbal baths when I couldn‚Äôt get to a sweat lodge. 

It‚Äôs important to honour our feelings of grief while also cleansing the energy off of us. In my culture, feelings are like sacred but they can also trap us. The spirits of depression and anxiety will try HARD to pull people in during grief. Especially women who deal with such ambiguous grief. 

Another thing, from my culture that is really accessible to anyone to do for themselves, is to prepare a feast for your late loved ones. Make a food that they loved, or you loved together, or that your family eats together, whatever it is. You make that yummy food, pray over it or just give gratitude if you‚Äôre not religious/spiritual, remember that food is part of the essence of life and motherhood. Its a legacy handed down to us by the people who loved us so much before we existed. And we honour them, and ourselves, by breaking bread with our ancestors and lost loved ones.

It sounds like you have everything thought out really well and what you said makes a lot of sense. I totally understand the age thing. I think your plan is a good one, I would just say to be prepared that it is still going to probably take quite a bit longer than you think, and while I very much hope that this would never happen, if God forbid you kept trying naturally while pursuing other options like IVF and you had another loss that will delay you. And perhaps it is different in your country but in a lot of places, especially if things like IVF are funded by national health insurance, but even if it isn‚Äôt, there may be quite a lot of testing and timeline boxes you have to check off. For example I am still going to have to do an HSG even though I‚Äôve gotten pregnant three times so my tubes are almost certainly not the issue. And if your country is not doing HSGs because of Covid I would be surprised if they are doing IVF cycles. These are all things you really won‚Äôt know about until you have your consultations. That‚Äôs awesome that you have different options for fertility clinics and that the embryo storage would not be cost prohibitive.
In terms of only having one child, that is just a personal decision depending on how things play out.

Everything I have written is just my personal thoughts and plans, not meant as a judgement or commentary on anyone else.

We were extremely lucky and were only trying for three cycles to achieve the loss.  I'm now moving into my sixth cycle which again I totally appreciate is completely within the realms of 'normal'.  I also absolutely believe that my loss was random chance, but how much am I prepared to wager on how long it will take to even get to that point again?  I think if I was 28...30...or even 32, or if I already had children, I would feel much more relaxed, but I won't deny that my age is a massive concern for me, especially as we do want more than one child.

I very much do hope that we can go on to conceive naturally, but I'm conscious that every month that goes by which doesn't result in a positive is a month lost.  Even a positive doesn't mean that that will result in a live birth, although as you say, the odds are that if I was to get pregnant again, it would be statistically be more likely to work out that way.  However, I feel my eyes are much more open to the bumps in the road and I don't want to regret at least exploring these options sooner rather than later.

My personal opinion, but I prefer going down the embryo freezing option because I am married, and so know that my husband is the only person I wish to have children with.  I also am on board with the benefits of freezing embryos over eggs in terms of the former's durability vs. the latter.  If we did have any 'spare' wherever this road takes us, then I would be fine with donating them to science.

I also thought that storage of embryos would be prohibitive, but actually it is relatively cheap to keep them - in my country, only a couple of hundred annually.  The costs where figures are in the thousands are the retrieval and then any actual cycles you use them in, but I would be happy to pay that for the retrieval (if we do decide that is right) and then I am sure I would be *more* than happy to pay if it did get to the point where we needed to use them.

I also totally hear you with the testing prior to doing this.  Something I would love to have is a HSG, but I'm not sure whether they are still possible atm with all of the COVID stuff still.  I'll know a lot more once we have the consultations, and to be clear, at the moment, we are just exploring the options, not definitely saying we will go ahead with it.  I need to learn a lot more about the various methods of egg retrieval (natural, mild etc), and I would imagine that if we do move ahead, that the clinic would require me to have some baseline fertility testing (AMH etc) first in any case.

I'm really sorry to hear that you've had to go through 3 CPs - I can't even imagine what that would be like.

Second of all, I would wait until you get some testing done with your fertility clinics to worry too much about frozen embryos etc. because there is a large variety of things in between first consultation and that step.

If that is more what you were hoping for, I might look more into freezing my eggs. Again though this all depends on what your fertility clinics say and what your testing shows. How long were you trying before your miscarriage?
And if you are curious about others‚Äô long term plans, right now we are benched waiting for my chemical that never wants to end to end and will finish our testing once I get my next normal period. I‚Äôm almost 35 and given my history my RE thinks IVF with genetic testing is probably our next step because I have had three CPs almost in a row. At this point it is likely we will only have one child, although depending on how smoothly the IVF process goes and if I were to have a successful pregnancy soon and we have other viable embryos we would maybe have a second, although unfortunately I would probably feel like I am tempting fate at that point.</p>

That said, my period returned at 8 weeks after my first loss and then I needed to do a cycle on BC the second time because I had a lot of odd spotting and a few anovulatory cycles.  </p>

<p>No need to apologize to me. Everything about this situation is garbage, your anger is super valid, and I&#39;m sorry if I offered some sort of misinformation  I do try to only speak to what I know so that I don&#39;t misinform anyone.</p>

And I&#39;m 95% positive I ovulated 3 days later on cd 21 based on bbt and cm. I found that my number of days with fertile cm was shorter, 2 days compared to the usual 4. My cycles are typically 28 days and I usually ovulate on cd16. I think it will all depend on how your hcg drops but I only ended up ovulating 5 days later than normal.
Hope this might help!</p>

<p>I‚Äôm so so sorry they made you feel this way, no one can understand it unless they‚Äôve done through a MC and know you have a wonderful support group here ü§ç</p>

I was wondering if anyone has experienced a light period after/while taking progesterone suppositories? I‚Äôve been taking mine vaginally exactly as described, from 3DPO until test day at 14DPO. Started spotting at 12DPO which is my normal luteal phase length, through 14DPO. Went off the supps on 14DPO (to appease the doctor, I had been getting negatives) and had a light flow yesterday, 15DPO. Today I wake up and have had barely any flow this morning and what I do have is brown, which I usually get in my first and last days of my period. Has anyone had a similar experience?

I wanted my life back on the plan, I wanted my baby back, I wanted to have the changes I was making in my life mean something. </p>

Hey there. I feel you and I‚Äôm so sorry for what you‚Äôre going through. After three losses, I had a lot of the same thoughts.

Sheryl sandberg told me to lean in!) and here I was at 32 thinking I still had plenty of time to have 2-3 children after climbing the corporate ladder.

Well boom, three losses with genetic defects and a realization that I‚Äôm ... old. I read every scholastic journal I could about the trisomies my losses had (15 and 16, not the more common 13, 18 or 21) and the only cause is maternal age. 

It sucks. Its a huge self esteem thing. I was definitely depressed for a long time. Not only dealing with grief but a kind of self hatred and regret about the choices I made in earlier life. I felt like my life was over.

Sorry for the novel, this post ended up being a release for me to write that down too, sorry! But back to you. Just want to say I feel you about these ugly thoughts.

If you can force yourself to focus on hope, on gratitude, you‚Äôll be in a better head space yourself. It‚Äôs easy to feel like there is absolutely nothing to be hopeful or grateful for, but I think there often can be.

Honestly, sometimes you cope by not being ok. This isn‚Äôt ok and sometimes it‚Äôs better to just let it out. I have a few big and good things in my life right now and while somewhere I am happy and grateful for them, right now my sadness is just bigger and that‚Äôs normal.

Each day let yourself feel any happiness you might find and for sure let yourself feel your sadness too. Your sadness is a love so big that has nowhere to go and that‚Äôs really hard and there are no rules for this.

If you started your antidepressants recently (as in after your loss) it‚Äôs normal you felt they weren‚Äôt working. It takes awhile for them to feel they are doing anything, about a month or more. It‚Äôs a medicine that builds up over time and they should be tapered off slowly under doctor supervision because stopping too fast can make you feel really bad. Most of them are safe for pregnancy but you can double check with your doctor.

I have to learn how to feel with the loss of him and sometimes, now, it feels ok like I can imagine thinking of what happened with love and less of the grief and trauma. We don‚Äôt move on from this but we learn and we recover and adapt and new beautiful things will come into our lives too.

Thank goodness they put me in a distant hallway afterward so I didn&#39;t have to be near the babies.</p>

If you are still having severe pain that isn‚Äôt controlled after the second day, or it is getting worse with nausea/vomiting or fever- definitely go back in, something isn‚Äôt right.

There can be many reasons for it; it depends on what week you typically experience those losses that can give us a potential clue. I'm sure you have already been through the gamete when it comes to testing.
Europe has a different healthcare model and that has definite benefits and also drawbacks, just like the US system has advantages and serious disadvantages. 
However what I've been seeing is that in Europe you tend to not have access to tests and treatments outside of the common ones, as easily as people from other countries do. Probably mostly due to the healthcare system in the US being able to charge the patient for literally everything, so they can make good money off of us by allowing us to do pretty much any test and treatment we want. 
That being said - what types of tests have you done so far? In the US we have a recurring loss panel that includes blood work to look for autoimmune issues, an endometrial tissue test to check for inflammation there, an hsg to check for hydrosalpinx and unusually shaped uteri, fibroids, etc. And for the male partner, check for varicocele on his man parts, that often causes dna fragmentation and can be fixed, check his blood work because low testosterone can be an indicator for DNA fragmentation and that can be helped with clomid (that's what happened to us).

DNA fragmentation is a pretty new test but not so new that it's entirely unheard of. It may, by policy of your country, not be offered yet. Can you ask your doctor to investigate? Do you have specialist fertility doctors in your country? Because really all they need to do is to send off the semen sample to a lab that does this kind of testing, it doesn't even need to be in your home country.
If you want to come armed, I'd suggest looking up some of the studies on the dna fragmentation subreddit and bring those/send those to your doctor to convince him/her to look into it. In medicine we try to practice ""evidence based medicine"" as much as possible, so having current research available is really what makes doctors look at new procedures and tests and be more willing to use them on their patients. 
 
I'm going to add u/chulzle in here, that user is the absolute expert in all things dna fragmentation, there's also a dna fragmentation subreddit I subscribe too that's very informative.

I know I need to take care of myself too, but I just feel so lost.</p>

I plan to send gifts when their babies are born, but not attend the showers and related events. </p>

<p>I hope that‚Äôs a bit helpful. Sending you a big hug.</p>

Every &quot;how&#39;d your appointment go?&quot; or &quot;how is the nursery coming along?&quot; stings, but I know I won&#39;t regret asking. I hope that sort of helps. Balancing being a friend and also being my own number one advocate has, for me, been the hardest part of all of this. It hurts so badly. Sending you love and courage.</p>
