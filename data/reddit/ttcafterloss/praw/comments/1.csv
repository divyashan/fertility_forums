I posted this a while back (and linked from this sub at some point also)...

""I was just in that thread over in /r/cautiousbb and asked about licorice tea. Lots of herbal teas have licorice and fennel. And I picked up a serious licorice candy habit living in Scandinavia.

I drink an herbal tea that is peppermint, fennel, and licorice nearly every day (one 6-8 oz cup). And I always have danish licorice candies with me, which I have at 1-2 pieces of every few days (not daily).

Apparently this is a bad idea.

I vaguely knew licorice wasn't great, but I didn't know why it was ""not recommended."" Now I know:

Licorice gets it's weird sweet flavor from glycyrrhizin. This stuff has been shown to cause trouble at differing dosages. Some studies tested the threshold at 250g/week. 250g is the equivalent of about 1 cup...over the course of a week. With candy and tea, that's not an unreasonable amount to take in in a week (based on what I saw women eating in a typical day in Denmark). The 250g threshold is tested in this study: http://aje.oxfordjournals.org/content/156/9/803.full - a study of pregnant Finish women and preterm labor.

These doses have been linked to pre-term labor and miscarriage. It is also known to influence hormone levels - especially estrogen. So it might exacerbate endometriosis, uterine fibroids, or other issues or parts of the fertility cycle that are impacted by estrogen levels.

This blog by a chemistry Prof in the US explains some of the issues clearly (though without in-text citations, so checking on specifics is hard - remember to cite your sources in-text kids!) http://drholly.typepad.com/licorice/

The EU advises pregnant women and those TTC to limit themselves to 50mg/day of glycyrrhizic acid (http://ec.europa.eu/food/fs/sc/scf/out186_en.pdf), based on studies looking at the point at which intake causes adverse effects in normal adults (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8386690).

Many herbal blend teas containing licorice have about 30-40mg of glycyrrhizic acid per serving (one cup).

I haven't found any folk-remedy advice regarding pregnancy in Scandinavia...Danish, Finish, and Swedish Ladies, do you put away your licorice teas and candies when you find out your pregnant? Care to share old scandinavian wives tales? ""

",[],,t1_coe6xs6,False,0,[],False,"<div class=""md""><p>Licorice. </p>

<p>I posted this a while back (and linked from this sub at some point also)...</p>

<p>&quot;I was just in that thread over in <a href=""/r/cautiousbb"">/r/cautiousbb</a> and asked about licorice tea. Lots of herbal teas have licorice and fennel. And I picked up a serious licorice candy habit living in Scandinavia.</p>

<p>I drink an herbal tea that is peppermint, fennel, and licorice nearly every day (one 6-8 oz cup). And I always have danish licorice candies with me, which I have at 1-2 pieces of every few days (not daily).</p>

<p>Apparently this is a bad idea.</p>

<p>I vaguely knew licorice wasn&#39;t great, but I didn&#39;t know why it was &quot;not recommended.&quot; Now I know:</p>

<p>Licorice gets it&#39;s weird sweet flavor from glycyrrhizin. This stuff has been shown to cause trouble at differing dosages.

This exactly. 

I think we all have some pretty ugly thoughts in this process. Remembering things like this are really important. 

The ugly thoughts don't do anything but make you bitter and angry. It can't be avoided some days, but I don't think anyone really believes those ugly thoughts when they pop up. Those of us trying for #1 might be angry, and vent here and there, but you'd be hard pressed to find any of us who actually think these things even if we do let ourselves get carried away venting now and then.  Like La_Plant says below - I have these thoughts, it feels awful to think them, and they come from the worst part of me, and I always try to remember that there's no baby-lottery.

Assuming the probabilities are independent (probably not true, but simplifies the math):

Rounding these numbers probably leads to the 20%, 5%, 1% statistics that get kicked around.

Of course, statistics don't tell us anything about individual factors - if (for example, to use totally made up numbers) you have low progesterone, which raises your risk of miscarriage each time to 80%, you now have a 64% chance of having two miscarriages.

A girl pops up that I casually knew in high school, but would never really call a friend. It was one of those cases where someone friends you, and you think, ""Eh... whatever."" and click accept.

She posted a link to her husband's GoFundMe page.  Asking 20k for... wait for it... hairplugs.

It made me RAGING mad. I can't quite articulate why other than when you go on that page, it shows campaigns of people asking for money for their brother's cancer treatment, or their father's funeral, or to help their friend rebuild after a fire. Not your fucking hairplugs. 

He has since taken it down, but it had the most cringeworthy justification to it. ""I want to go back to the man my wife fell in love with. I want to look back at pictures with my boys and be happy with how I look.""

A girl pops up that I casually knew in high school, but would never really call a friend.

<p>She posted a link to her husband&#39;s GoFundMe page.  Asking 20k for... wait for it... hairplugs.</p>

<p>It made me RAGING mad. I can&#39;t quite articulate why other than when you go on that page, it shows campaigns of people asking for money for their brother&#39;s cancer treatment, or their father&#39;s funeral, or to help their friend rebuild after a fire. Not your fucking hairplugs. </p>

<p>He has since taken it down, but it had the most cringeworthy justification to it. &quot;I want to go back to the man my wife fell in love with. I want to look back at pictures with my boys and be happy with how I look.&quot;</p>

5 DPO: Felt some twinges in the area between my ovaries and uterus. Convinced it was LO making his/her presence known on the way to the ute.
6 DPO: I noticed my cervix had risen back up high and was soft and closed. Ovia decided to move my fertile window to the following week. I was not convinced.
7-9 DPO: Very tired, kind of moody. Really mild AF type cramps. My face has declared war on itself with the acne that's happening right now. Craved orange soda. I hate orange soda. Had that dream. 
10 DPO: This happened: http://imgur.com/JxMXdqH and the line came up right away.

And this time I got snappy about it. You would think that nurses at the OBGYN would actually bother to check their files before seeing the patient, but NOPE.

So I went in for my first follow-up appointment since the miscarriage. I was steeling myself to be surrounded by all the pregnant women, and to have to go back to the same ultrasound room where I saw the heartbeat a few weeks ago and also found out I was miscarrying. Stupidly, I guess I assumed that since my OBGYN had recently made the mistake of calling me to 'see how the pregnancy was going' even though I'd been found to be miscarrying last time that this appointment I'd be treated a little more sensitively. Ha.

First thing out of the nurse's mouth in a bored voice when I stepped into the physical room. ""How many weeks?""

Me: *speechless* 

Nurse: ""Well, how many weeks pregnant? Do you not know!?""

Husband: ""...She just had a miscarriage.""

Nurse: ""Oh. Sorry. Well, when was your last period then?""

And then it was on. Tears, running eye-makeup, snot, the whole nine yards. The nurse must have apologised like 20 times but I was just so pissed off that they would do this to me twice in two fucking weeks. I just looked her full in the face and told her: ""This is the second time you guys have done this to me. I really think you should get in the habit of checking the files."" 

Then I walked off. But the damage had been done and I had to sit in the ultrasound room crying for ages before I could get myself together again. Thank god for my husband being there.

Anyway, I finally saw the doctor and thankfully, so thankfully, weird symptoms from last week are gone and she thinks I've passed everything so I don't have to go in for a D&C. She said the lining looks really good now and if we want to try again immediately that is fine by her.

OB also offered to refer us for semen and bloodwork analysis or even to an RE if we want to. I think we'll probably do the 3 day test and analysis next month and save the RE until we've been trying for a few more months, but it's nice to have the option on the table.

So generally, all was good with the exception of that nurse, who I think probably won't be making that mistake again for a while.

Afterwards my husband took me out for cocktails and oysters and told me that I should enjoy it while I can, because we're totally going to get pregnant again soon. :) So that was really lovely. <3 him.",[],,t1_co9xcy6,False,0,[],False,"<div class=""md""><p>It fucking happened again, you guys.

To answer your first question, I was told that my IC is a congenital defect, and I just wasn't born with the connective tissue to hold my cervix closed after the baby is a certain weight. This is my first loss, and I don't have a history of cervical issues, but the lack of contractions prior to dilation was the main indication that I have IC. 

I actually came to the decision of getting a TAC on my own, after doing a lot of research about IC. It's skipping a step or two in the usual progression of treatment, but I just don't have the time or resources to lose anymore children. I'll be 40 next month, I have infertility issues, and can't afford the expense of IVF multiple times, so I have to do everything I can to keep my next baby if I'm lucky enough to get pregnant again. The TAC has better success rates for full-term birth but it has the huge downside of major surgery; in the end, I want to be able to say I did everything in my power to prevent another loss. If I got a TVC and it failed, I'd be close to 42 by the time I could ttc again. 

I'm going against the advice of two OBs, who think I should try a TVC and see what happens. My MFM understands my reasoning and is supportive, which made me feel a little less uncertain.

The MFM team I'll be working with cited a European study that indicated 3 second-trimester losses were ""required"" for a diagnosis of IC...but given that it would be stupid to let me lose three pregnancies, and given that we can rule out a lot of other variables, we're just going to assume that intervention is needed and go for it. I We also required fertility treatments to get pregnant, although our first IUI using Femara worked last May and I'll be doing that again next month if this second natural cycle we're trying post-loss doesn't pan out.)  

Everyone handles this differently, but for me talking about my experience and validating my son's existence as my child and my identity as his mom has been helpful.

Weirdest announcement ever, haha. But, it is the first time since before Kieran was born (so sometime in November). It was a big deal for me.

I had made up my mind to do it that day, but as we lay in bed I panicked again and told him I couldn't. My husband is great though, he kissed me and said not to stress about it, and only when I'm ready. 

So then I did the right thing and put myself in the right mindset and made sure I was really really in the mood (with his help), and we did it! It was actually really lovely and we reassured each other after. 

I was waiting to see how I felt afterwards, I expected regret or grief or panic, but so far I feel neutral with a tiny bit of excitement.

But this morning he woke me up and asked with a huge smile if we are trying for another baby now? Um hello...yes? So then I got confused and said ""I guess so, I'll think about it more"". Does he not know how babies are MADE? What did he think last night was about then? But I think he was just excited and wanting to discuss plans. We'll have a talk tonight.

Anyway, we'll see from here on. I took my vitamins and had an extra healthy breakfast today. Feeling motivated and happy.

Also, [TMI] my vagina is all sorts or weird now since the episiotomy, and I felt like I had to poop constantly during sex which was bizarre, anyone here with experience who knows if that is normal?

Also my chart temps aren't super high which is scary, today was 97.73.

I think I'd eat [these](http://www.trinigourmet.com/index.php/pastelles/). They are the traditional Christmas food from my home country, and I love them. I love the ones my grandmother makes best, so I'd need her to make them. 


> - I'm visiting you for a nice long weekend. Where do you take me out to eat, drink, and be merry? What local fare would it be blasphemous for me not to try?


We just moved! I'll figure that out soon. In Toronto, though, there are honestly a thousand different places I'd want to go to! I love to eat. My fave Korean place for pork bone stew and some fried rice cakes, Ethiopian, the soft shell crab at this one Thai place, everything at a different Thai place, really yummy super loud izakaya place, everything in Chinatown, Portuguese pastry... 

Okay if I had to choose just two, the St. Lawrence [market](http://www.stlawrencemarket.com) is delicious, especially in the summer. The summer produce is incredible. Excellent quality from Ontario farms. You get tonnes of unusual heirloom fruits and veggies. There are also food stalls and you can get a huge variety of homemade goods of various cultures. I also love [this](http://www.cafebelong.ca) place. The food is awesome; locally sourced and so delicious, beautiful and creative! The dessert is fantastic. The setting is gorgeous. It's in a former quarry and brick factory that has been rehabbed into a gorgeous park with trails and stuff.  

For drinks I love Bellwoods Brewery. Their beer is delicious and fun! As far as local Toronto fare... I have no idea if there is actually anything that is Toronto, or even Ontario specific.


> -By the last night of my visit, we're tired of going out for every meal. What signature deliciousness do you like to make at home?


I'm particularly good at making food from my home country, mainly because it's comforting. I'd make you stewed oxtail and pigeon peas and rice. And a salad. I love making salad. No dessert! I don't make desserts I'm just oddly bad at it. 


> -What snacks would you keep on-hand at all times, regardless of whether or not they made you morbidly obese?


Chocolate covered pretzels. Salted milk chocolate bars. Wine gums. Cassava chips. Tunnocks caramel bars. Papaya chunks. Frozen mango chunks. 


> -What foods do you really just find disgusting that other people probably love?


Beets. Developed an aversion while I was pregnant and can't eat them anymore. :(

I'll go first: I feel terrible that any pregnancy talk may have made someone feel bad. To an extent, I understand it can't be helped, and its okay for someone to be happy for me but sad for themselves. And I don't expect people to do constant cartwheels for my news. But its a hard balance. For example: I told my sister yesterday. She laughed and said, ""OMG, again!? Well, I'm not getting attached this time. We'll see..."" She meant well, and understands that I'm trying hard to protect myself from the pain of another loss (she's my dear friend, please don't comment on how rude she was...it's a matter of perspective/sensitivity and she made a mistake that I love her too much to care about), but...ouch. To me, this is what I hear when people wish you ""sticky beans"" or whatever.

I also have a friend I promised to tell who is struggling with infertility, ivf, and loss. I can't bring myself to do it because while I know she'll be happy, I also know the news will make her sad.

Today has been a clusterfuck for me, gaaah.

Anyway, I completely agree that discussion of pregnancy and positive tests should stay in the Alumni thread. While I am really happy for everyone who got a positive this week (seriously, it was crazy how many there were!), it did get a bit overwhelming for me. I'll edit the posts so they're more clear on what type of discussion is okay in each posts - it should update when Automoderator posts the new ones at midnight. 

However, I definitely DON'T want anyone to think that once you get a positive HPT, you're like.. banished to the Alumni thread or something. I think that there is room for cross-over between the two threads and I would *like* pregnant people to offer support/encouragement in the TTC thread and vice versa. But I think that talking about current pregnancies or positive tests should be kept to the Alumni thread just to be respectful of everyone's feelings. 

As for using phrases like ""baby dust"", ""sticky bean"", etc. - I personally don't really like the terms, and telling someone you wish their baby is ""sticky"" bothers me because to me, it's like saying ""welp, hope you don't lose it this time!"". I'm not sure that I necessarily want to *ban* those phrases though. I don't want to put too many limits on what people can say here because I think that discourages discussion and can make people feel unwelcome or worried about saying the wrong thing. Unfortunately, all of us have had different types of losses and experienced those losses differently... so I think it's really, really hard to know what to say, even when you're talking to someone with a similar history. I know that sometimes I want to provide support but I struggle with what words to use. I think, to a point, we need to recognize that people mean well and try not to let their specific phrasing get to us.

As for self-posts about positive tests - currently they're allowed as long as they're tagged with [BFP]. We haven't had any in awhile but when we first did, TBH I just clicked ""hide"" when they bothered me. I personally don't see a need to ban them but that's definitely up for discussion. I don't really like the idea of a ""weekly BFP thread"" like other subs have, because that's basically what the daily Alumni thread is currently functioning as, and I don't want to ask people to wait up to a week to talk about their tests. I think we could either allow BFP self-posts or ask people to post that they got a positive in the Alumni thread only.

I'd like to make an anonymous poll about all of these things so I can get a better feel for what everybody is thinking without wondering if some members are just keeping their opinions to themselves. Here are some things I'd like to put on the poll, and then we can discuss them after the results come in:

1. Should certain words/phrases on the sub be *banned* (grounds for removing a post/comment)? If so, please list those words or phrases.

2. Should certain words/phrases on the sub be *discouraged* (with a note in the sidebar asking members not to use them)? If so, please list.

3. Should self-posts about positive pregnancy tests be allowed (they are currently allowed as long as they are tagged with [BFP])? 

If anyone has any suggestions for other questions please let me know here or PM me.. my brain isn't working today so I can't think of anything else.",[],,t1_co6de9q,False,0,[],False,"<div class=""md""><p>I had a response all typed out to this and then my app restarted... so that was cool. Today has been a clusterfuck for me, gaaah.</p>

<p>Anyway, I completely agree that discussion of pregnancy and positive tests should stay in the Alumni thread. While I am really happy for everyone who got a positive this week (seriously, it was crazy how many there were!), it did get a bit overwhelming for me. I&#39;ll edit the posts so they&#39;re more clear on what type of discussion is okay in each posts - it should update when Automoderator posts the new ones at midnight. </p>

<p>However, I definitely DON&#39;T want anyone to think that once you get a positive HPT, you&#39;re like.. banished to the Alumni thread or something. I think that there is room for cross-over between the two threads and I would <em>like</em> pregnant people to offer support/encouragement in the TTC thread and vice versa. But I think that talking about current pregnancies or positive tests should be kept to the Alumni thread just to be respectful of everyone&#39;s feelings. </p>

<p>As for using phrases like &quot;baby dust&quot;, &quot;sticky bean&quot;, etc. - I personally don&#39;t really like the terms, and telling someone you wish their baby is &quot;sticky&quot; bothers me because to me, it&#39;s like saying &quot;welp, hope you don&#39;t lose it this time!&quot;. I&#39;m not sure that I necessarily want to <em>ban</em> those phrases though. I don&#39;t want to put too many limits on what people can say here because I think that discourages discussion and can make people feel unwelcome or worried about saying the wrong thing. Unfortunately, all of us have had different types of losses and experienced those losses differently... so I think it&#39;s really, really hard to know what to say, even when you&#39;re talking to someone with a similar history. I know that sometimes I want to provide support but I struggle with what words to use. I think, to a point, we need to recognize that people mean well and try not to let their specific phrasing get to us.</p>

<p>As for self-posts about positive tests - currently they&#39;re allowed as long as they&#39;re tagged with [BFP]. We haven&#39;t had any in awhile but when we first did, TBH I just clicked &quot;hide&quot; when they bothered me. I personally don&#39;t see a need to ban them but that&#39;s definitely up for discussion. I don&#39;t really like the idea of a &quot;weekly BFP thread&quot; like other subs have, because that&#39;s basically what the daily Alumni thread is currently functioning as, and I don&#39;t want to ask people to wait up to a week to talk about their tests. I think we could either allow BFP self-posts or ask people to post that they got a positive in the Alumni thread only.</p>

<p>I&#39;d like to make an anonymous poll about all of these things so I can get a better feel for what everybody is thinking without wondering if some members are just keeping their opinions to themselves. Here are some things I&#39;d like to put on the poll, and then we can discuss them after the results come in:</p>

I don't think I'll be able to get the full CD3 workup done this cycle, not least because my regular doc doesn't really *do* a lot of fertility stuff (she didn't understand why I wanted progesterone tested in addition to hCG, e.g.), but I might be able to get the 7DPO one done, even if I get a referral.

We get there before K & G and the lady tries to seat us at a booth. I looked at my husband, who didn't get it, and said, ""No we're going to need a table, not a booth. Our friend is turbo pregnant and won't fit in there.""

I was really uncomfortable- having a hard time making eye contact with her... they opened our present which was a cardboard book and a card with a gift card in it.

Who knows if a late ovulation will mean that my egg is crummy, but doc says &quot;I&#39;m gonna go with it.&quot;  They&#39;ll look at my bloodwork and probably bring me in again in another 3 or 4 days.  If this cycle goes how my last one did, they&#39;ll hopefully bring me in on Wednesday, because ovulation on Thursday would follow last cycle&#39;s pattern.  </p>

<p>Doc is reminding me that while it&#39;s OK that my expectations are low, &quot;I&#39;m not giving up on this cycle until it&#39;s over.&quot;  And at the very least we&#39;re learning that my ovaries are still shitty at their job (doc made a hilarious gesture like a little old lady climbing up a hill in a walker), which means that next cycle we&#39;ll give them a nice little boost with Femara again. </p>

<p>So we&#39;ll see.  </p>

I even had a (not very close) friend ask &quot;so, you don&#39;t like babies?&quot; I kind of stammered out a vague answer, and she immediately knew something was weird, but didn&#39;t press further.</p>

<p>Baby steps though (no pun intended!). I can handle babies in movies now, and I can walk past the baby section at the pharmacy with no problem.</p>
