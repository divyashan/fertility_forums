But please don&#39;t think you are destined to just be dealt the worst hand forever. It doesn&#39;t work that way. At least there is the security that life is way more random than that. 
I hope you get massive support, you deserve it.</p>

Because of this, he is sending us for karyotyping. This was my first pregnancy and loss and I&#39;ve not heard of anyone getting karyotyping done after one. I&#39;m fully panicking now that my results were so horrible that they think we need to jump to this right away. Has anyone else had this experience?</p>

<p>I&#39;m also aware that I&#39;m fortunate that my doctor wants to test proactively, because I know some people struggle to get testing done even after two recurring losses. I&#39;m just worried about the implications of this and if he is suggesting that he thinks one or both of us has a problem. I feel like my dreams of having my rainbow baby are slipping away.</p>

It’s a great sign you’re getting pregnant in the first place without any intervention. 

Being Rh- may be a factor here. Basically if you’re Rh- and your partner is Rh+, it means your baby may possibly have Rh+ blood. 

My understanding is that you don’t necessarily share blood flow/type with your baby. But if you miscarry, the baby’s blood may mix with yours. So if they’re Rh+, and it mixes with your blood, your blood will create antibodies/attack the Rh+ blood cells...potentially causing a miscarriage or still birth. 

There is a shot called Rhogam, which prevents your blood from attacking any Rh+ cells. Typically you only get it later in pregnancy and once after birth.

I was convinced I was pregnant last month - I wasn't. After temping and recording every single symptom this month, I was even more convinced. I'm a day away from my period and I just know it's coming.

It's exhausting and a million times more disappointing when it doesn't happen, as you feel foolish for hoping for the best. The month I got pregnant (which sadly ended in a loss) I hadn't thought about it once. In fact, the day I found out, I had been shopping and bought my favourite bottle of wine - THAT'S how little I'd considered it (and we'd been trying for a couple of months).

The thing is, even when your symptoms suggest you're due to get your period (and frustratingly, they are almost identical) you will only justify them as an anomoly, or link them to a pregnancy symptom. It's like when you cave and take a test early - if it shows as negative then you just tell yourself ""it's too early, I'm not out just yet"". Yeah, that can be the case, and you search the Internet for stories that support it, but for most people you're just out that month. It's really emotionally draining. 

I'm not going to say stop symptom spotting, as I'd be a massive hypocrite. What I can say, as someone who is feeing the disappointment of a negative test this month, it's much better if you try to distance yourself from guessing either way, until the day after your missed period when you see those two lines.

But if this is what you enjoy and you're the kind of person who can be hopeful and not lose faith, it's absolutely fine for you to do this. At the end of the day, you are very intune with your own body and may be right!

It’s a horrible thing to go through, and I hope you have a good ‘support person’ to be there for you through this. 

I miscarried naturally at 7/8 weeks. I didn’t need any medication to do so, so I cannot comment on that as far as the medication making it more painful. 
But, it wasn’t as painful as I thought it would be. I’ve had friends miscarry and say it was excruciating, and others say it was basically like a heavy period. 

For me, I had been spotting off an on for a week. It gradually got darker. Once the bleeding turned bright red, I started cramping. I had what felt like contractions. I have had a baby vaginally before, and the contractions I felt, were about how my contractions felt during early onset of labor. Very tolerable. The contractions came in waves, about 30 seconds apart, but basically felt like strong period cramps. I didn’t take any ibuprofen for pain either. I passed the sac and placenta in about 2 hours of the onset of cramping, and the contractions/cramps stopped immediately when the sac/tissues passed. 

I bled for about a week and a half. When you’re bleeding, all you want is for it to stop and be over with, so please be gracious to yourself during that time. Also, be forewarned, you may have a ‘hormone crash’. I didn’t expect that at all. I had the same thing happen to me that happened after I gave birth to my daughter - which was worse than the miscarriage to me. EVERYTHING made me cry. I honestly didn’t think I was pregnant enough for that to happen again. Like I had emotionally processed what happened and come to terms with it, but I would randomly burst in to tears, out of the blue, for NO reason, for a few weeks after. Everything triggered it. Music. Happy things. Sad things. Anger. My husband being sweet to me. My child being cute. Idk. It’s a very weird feeling to describe, and it’s my least favorite aspect of the postpartum process.

I can’t remember when the cramping and bleeding started but I think it was a while for sure, a few hours or so?
  
I had a panicked moment where it was time to insert the next dose but the previous pills hadn’t dissolved all the way yet. I couldn’t call the doctor as the offices and pharmacies were closed and ended up asking an online forum and paying an online doctor to ask if I could take the next dose or if I should wait. I also asked if I could still nurse my baby because that question had slipped my mind. -Yes you can nurse while using the medication, yes just insert the next dose even if the other pills had not dissolved yet.  
  
One sort of neat thing was that the sac expelled completely intact, I could see my egg in there and the placenta. It was sort of cathartic.  
  
Something I was not prepared for over the coming weeks was how many different professionals would be continuing to examine me to make sure everything had been expelled. It was difficult while recovering from the loss. And I bled for about 8 weeks or more, which I’m unsure if it is normal not. I would think it had stopped, go for a walk and then it would gush out all at once, which felt scary. Or I would have another doctor visit and after my cervix being probed again I would start bleeding again. -so always have a pad with you for a bit.  
  
I didn’t take pain medication with the misoprostol, but I hadn’t asked or been prescribed any. Pain wise in my experience was worse then a bad menstrual period but I used a heating pad and hot water bottle. I would talk to your doctor about options for pain management, if there is anything to help you become more comfortable during, it is worth it.  
  
If you can, give yourself a couple days free of responsibility and surrounded by support. If you would rather be alone that is okay too! I found my partner to be rather insensitive to me during the miscarriage and I felt like I was suffering alone and I had a toddler and him to take care of.

I think it’s important to hear the OK experiences in addition to the bad ones, so here goes. 

I found out on a Friday I had a blighted ovum, GA of 6w3d at what should’ve been 9 weeks. My doctor gave me Mife at that appointment. 

I took the Miso at 9:30 pm Saturday, about 36 hours after the Mife. I popped 800mg of ibuprofen 45 minutes before. I began feeling light/moderate cramping around 11pm. (I previously had Paragard so I am used to strong cramps). I laid in bed and watched tv for about 2-3 hours before falling asleep.

Around 3:45 pm I woke up from my alarm to take more ibuprofen and about 10-15 minutes later, I felt what felt like the beginning of my period (flow + cramps). I ran to the restroom and sat on the toilet. I felt the strangest sensation in my uterus (like a pressure but no pain) and an urge to push. I passed the sac. Cramping lightened. 

I did a second dose 24 hours later which didn’t add anything. 

From then, I just had some medium sized clots whenever I peed for the next few days. It was like a heavy period I was used to from my Paragard + clots. I bled for about a week. It stopped for a couple days then came back. I just had my f/u ultrasound last Thursday and everything had cleared.

If your doctor will give you narcotics meds, I recommend taking them. The cramps were manageable to me, but I had terrible, nearly debilitating cramps with Paragard so ymmv. I did mine at night and was blessed to have slept through a lot of it. If I could do it over again, I’d do the same thing.

 As for the physical experience.. I feel like it took ages to work. My instructions were to insert two pills vaginally. It's meant to start working within about 6 hours of insertion.

I felt nauseous more than anything although there were definitely strange, dull cramps. I dont remember ever feeling real pain but it still wasnt pleasant.

I started passing clots really quickly after the bleeding started. That was weird because they were all quite large so I could really feel it.

One thing I didnt expect was a follow up with my doctor but I'd strongly encourage you to ask for one if they dont offer. A ton of people have problems with retained tissue.

The baby should've been 11 weeks but measured 8 and had no heartbeat.

General advice:

1. heat packs, more than one of them (one for front, one for back). They do more than painkillers
2. recommendations for appropriate painkillers for miscarrying on misoprostol seem to vary a bit by region - confirm with your doctor when you get the misoprostol which painkillers you can take and at what dosage
3. adult diapers. I found these necessary for overnights in particular
4. snacks, easily eaten foods, beverages, etc - be ready to not be up for much of anything, including cooking
5. a really good distraction - a Netflix binge, a new game, something
6. if you're offered a second dose for a week after the first, take it. Ask about protocol with your doc - if they don't do an ultrasound to confirm whether you've passed all tissue, definitely ask for the second dose of misoprostol

Specifics:

I was prescribed 600mg, vaginally, in one dose. The cramping started right away, but it took about 3 hours to induce the start of my miscarriage. Once it did, the first thing that happened was that I felt the amniotic sac burst, and had a massive flood of fluid. Very glad I had received advice from another woman who'd been through this before to get adult diapers for the start of things, because it was a sudden huge flood, which would definitely not have been contained by my ultra heavy duty overnight pads.

Things are going to get very graphic and messy, and will probably last longer than a period. On the first day, I passed the amniotic fluid, the sac with embryo inside, and a lot of blood and clots. It took two more days before I passed the placenta (largely whole). I had a piece of placental attachment that was retained and I received poor medical care, so I was left to bleed intermittently for three months before they confirmed that I'd had retained tissue that would very likely have been cleared with a second dose taken a week after the first.

I found painkillers did just about nothing for my cramping, which was strong but not unbearable. The heating pads were my absolute best friends - I often had one on my lower back and one on my low abdomen, and they did a lot to ease the cramping for me. Highly highly recommend. I discovered a new reflex (the urge to push) in a context I wish I hadn't discovered it, and I saw a lot of gore (way more than I could believe had even been inside me at that point).

That said, I didn't want a D&C and I couldn't bear waiting, and despite the troubles and medical mismanagement and poor care I received, I don't regret the choice that I made. I didn't want surgery and I am glad I managed to avoid it, despite the costs to me in this particular instance.

I am not a squeamish person and I am a biologist by profession, so I wasn't particularly disturbed by the gore and flesh. But I can see how it might be traumatic for others to experience it so intimately, so if you're worried about dealing with big bloody clots and a placenta and sac, this could be a very difficult experience for you. It's definitely a very messy process.

If your rate of bleeding exceeds about 1 pad per hour, if you develop a fever, or if the bloody discharge has a foul odour, you will need the ER. I'm sure your doctor will go over the potential circumstances under which you need to go to the hospital, but it's good to have some sense of what you'll need to be monitoring, too. A thermometer is going to be necessary so you can check your temperature.

I would recommend having somebody with you at least for the first two or three days, when things are most dangerous for you and also most intense, so that there is somebody on hand to get you help if you can't get yourself to help, and also so that you have somebody to hold your hand and smooth your hair back and cry with you. Also, because of how long it can take for the pills to take effect (2-6 hours usually), it's best to take them first thing in the morning. In light of needing company and wanting to be awake to deal with the worst of it, I took mine on a Saturday morning.

I have a question for those who have experienced natural miscarriage. I've had several miscarriages which have been dealt with via misoprostal but for my most recent loss my doctor wanted to me to try the natural route.

My baby stopped growing at 7+4 and I found out on Thursday. I then had several days of increasing spotting. Today I've had bright red blood and a few small clots along with severe cramping. The cramping and clotting subsided after a couple of hours and I now have general discomfort and bright red bleeding (similar to my regular menstrual flow).

My question is: for those of you who have had a natural loss before, did you have several instances of cramping and clotting, or just one episode? Did it start and stop again several times before you passed everything?

With my medicated miscarriages, after I took the pills I cramped, bled and clotted a LOT for several hours, where I passed a lot of tissue, and it was over. This time I don't feel like I've passed a lot of tissue and my gut feeling is that it's not over. So I'm wondering if I should brace myself for more in the coming days? I really don't know what to expect and I wish I'd been given the pills again so that at least I could control when it's going to happen.

I have a follow-up on Wednesday so they'll perform another ultrasound and if I haven't passed everything I will insist on the pills or a d&c.",[],,t1_flaie6z,False,0,[],False,"<div class=""md""><p>Hello all.</p>

My understanding is that if you're healthy, don't have significant risk factors and are trying to conceive the old fashioned way, the WHO is saying it's still safe to conceive and carry. 

For those who need medical assistance to conceive, there is a suggestion to wait which is tied to social distancing (can't do that if you need procedures), keeping as many people out of medical facilities as possible and keeping medical staff and resources available for crisis/emergency situations related to COVID-19. 

Obviously if you're TTC right now you want to be extra, extra careful and there is increased risks with this virus making it's way around. In the US, it is expected to peak over the next 3-7 weeks and then hopefully decline if everyone does their part with social distancing and quarantining as necessary. 🤞🤞🤞

So, if you get pregnant right now you will have more risks but its probably most risky for women who are already in their 1st trimester currently. Risk should decline from May onward, however we will likely see another big surge when social distancing and shelter at home restrictions are lifted, so likely this fall. 

And yes we don't know if it has a true impact on fetuses yet, but it is promising that it doesn't appear it is transmitted through blood, amniotic fluid, breastmilk, etc. However, lots of questions marks. The biggest concern clearly is fever, and the mother getting in to severe respiratory distress during pregnancy as those thing are both linked to potential negative outcomes.",[],,t1_fl7z77z,False,0,[],False,"<div class=""md""><p>Not a doctor here, but I work for a healthcare organization and have a lot of conversations with medical staff and infectious disease staff. </p>

My third MC (5 weeks) was very similar to a period, probably because it was so early.

It&#39;s ridiculous to just tell you to &quot;sleep it off&quot;! As for your mental health, if you aren&#39;t able to see your usual therapist in person, could you maybe try an online service such as <a href=""https://betterhelp.com"">betterhelp.com</a>? I&#39;ve been doing weekly video chat sessions with a counselor, and you have the ability to switch counselors at any time if you don&#39;t connect with the first you&#39;re matched with. It may be a good option to ensure you continue getting help until life returns to normal. All of my losses have been first trimester, so I can&#39;t even imagine how you&#39;re feeling, but if you ever need someone to vent to, feel free to reach out to me directly. Wishing you the best!</p>

It’s an arterial venous malformation that occurs within the 6-13 week of pregnancy and generally causes left sided heart failure in utero and after birth.  DS originally had left sided heart failure and his team stabilized him the night he was born, the next day he went into right sided heart failure after having brain surgery his first day of life to hopefully stop some of the bleeding in his brain.  Due to both instances of his heart failing on two separate nights, his blood pressure dropped significantly for an extended period of time.

Some drs will have you start progesterone 3 DPO, others will have you start when you get a positive HPT.

In my case, before I ever started progesterone, I got pregnant literally every time we tried (they just all ended in MC)—we were 3 for 3. After I started taking progesterone 3 DPO, I had 3 consecutive unsuccessful cycles—we were 0-3.

I thought this was extremely odd. I’d always heard taking extra progesterone didn’t have a downside, but I just couldn’t shake the feeling that somehow it was screwing things up. On a hunch, I decided to hold off on the progesterone, and low and behold, that cycle—our last attempt before we started down the forced ovulation path—I got pregnant again. I started the progesterone as soon as I got the positive HPT.

In my research. I found this (mouse) study about how TOO much progesterone can actually inhibit implantation(!). I have to think this is what was going on in my case—that my progesterone levels were never actually low to begin with, and that the supplementation 3 DPO was interfering with implantation.

Anyway, everyone is different of course, but just wanted to share this in case it’s helpful to anyone else out there!

1. Perhaps I’m too late to give advice on this since you posted a while ago. But do whatever you most feel like, not what you think others expect you to do or what you think you ‘should’ be doing. He’s your baby, it’s your feelings, it’s your choice.

2. I had the drug to stop my milk, but I had retained placenta so my bleeding lasted a lot longer (I only bled reasonably heavily for a week) I bled lightly for 3 weeks before taking miso for retained placenta. I ovulated and got my period a few weeks after that. So yes, you can ovulate before. They possibly aren’t giving you answers for this as it can vary for everyone, but if the bleeding never seems to stop you may have retained tissue. 
3. You should get a check up around 6 weeks, not 12. I would check that with wherever you’re meant to be getting your checkup. You do have to wait to get the ‘all clear’ before trying/having sex again because it could cause an infection. I understand how hard it is to wait right now, when you so badly want to be pregnant again. 
4. I don’t have any answers for this one, i don’t know much about this. Although I don’t think that having a d&c previously would have any affect on a future pregnancy.

There’s actually a thriving community about having just one child and that being okay. 

While I do hope to have a second child someday my wife might be okay with one. The thing to consider is having a sibling is no guarantee your kids will even like one another. My brother in law is only 16 months older than my wife and they barely talk despite him living five miles away. 

My sister lives 20 miles away and is four years older than me and I consider her a close friend.

Her pregnancy continued, mine ended and we found out at 8 weeks...just a couple weeks before our planned Christmas double pregnancy announcement to my parents. 
I can’t imagine what you’re going through losing you baby even later than I did. But I can tell you I totally understand not being able to hear about her pregnancy or be around it.

She texted me “we find out if it’s a boy or girl tomorrow”...that stung. My first thought is “why would you tell me that??” No one gets it. I told my husband that hearing or thinking about her pregnancy is like a mirror of the alternate universe where my pregnancy didn’t end in a miscarriage. Because if she’s about to find out about the sex, that means I would be, too...except I’m not. 

My family tries, but they don’t get it. My mom knows about the miscarriage and all the details and a couple days ago she asked if I wanted to video chat in (with a ton of extended family) for the gender reveal. I think it’s so obvious that I don’t? But my husband tells me it’s not so obvious and they’re just trying to include me. Last night I talked to my mom and she spent a bunch of time showing me baby clothes she bought for my sister’s (soon to be) baby boy. It sucks. I’m angry. No one gets it, not even my husband. He doesn’t know why I can’t separate my sadness for myself and still feel happy for her. The most I can say is that I’m thankful she isn’t experiencing the pain I’m going through. I’m sure deep down I’m actually HAPPY for her. But I don’t feel it right now and I can’t see it. 

We’ve been trying since the miscarriage and tomorrow I start my third period since it happened (I know because I track my BBT). So today I’m drinking. 

I know this probably doesn’t help but since I wish someone would say it to me...I’ll say it to you: it’s OK that you can’t talk to them about it. It’s ok that your heart aches. You DO NOT have to have a conversation about it with them. Full stop. Do you. Do what you need to do. Life will go on for everyone else.

We TFMR in June of last year at 21.5

He was supposed to be our last/second. We upgraded vehicles and bought a house in anticipation. Our daughter was extremely excited for her younger brother. Our whole families were excited. I felt like my life was perfect. How naive of me. 

We found out at the anatomy scan everything was wrong. Everything. He wouldn't have survived without immediate and extensive lifelong medical intervention. 

Not a single person asked me how I was doing or hugged me when it was over. All our dreams down the fucking drain. How do you explain to an excited 3 year old her baby brother is dead? I don't even know who in my family knows what actually happened. THAT'S how alone I've been. 

My brother was having his 3rd, due a month after Lincoln should have been born. Right before Christmas, right at Thanksgiving. I had to be in the same room as that baby, people offering to let me hold it, all while grieving my dead baby that the world forgot ever existed inside of my body. 

And I'm 36,turning 37.

2 months after he was born and I could barely hold it together my 21 year old niece announced her pregnancy and literally immediately asked me if I was ever going to try for another. Speechless. 
 
I wasn't invited to her gender reveal, thank God. But her stupid baby shower is next weekend. I have to go. I don't want to. 

It's so hard to be so happy for someone but simultaneously not understand why they get to have a healthy happy baby. She lives in a dilapidated old house across from her parents who do everything for her. She's been at her job MAYBE a year and apparently is skipping college now. She is morbidly obese, has pcos and is now diabetic. I work out 7 days a week and eat super healthy. It's fucking hard but I do it. We worked hard for all we have. To buy a nice house on a good street with a good school. Our daughter asks over and over why she doesn't ""have a baby in this house."" 

I'm ranting and I'm sorry. 

I think it's OK to feel however you feel. Grief is hard, and takes many forms and changes constantly. 

Sometimes I literally have to say to people 'well my baby is dead. How do you expect me to feel/react/etc""... but I'm blunt, so that works for me. 

Sometimes the only thing that helps is thinking about how it could be worse. I mean, I dont know what's worse, concenting to letting your baby die is the worst thing I have ever been through. 

But it does get easier. I think about Lincoln every day multiple times a day and feel so guilty and sad and tell him how sorry I am but it isn't easy, it's just easier. 

I'm old. I don't know if we will get another chance. But I'm trying. 

I wish I could hug you. Because I know how it feels.

I have experienced two first trimester losses; the first at 11 weeks and the second between 5-6 weeks.

In some aspects I am better than the person I used to be, but I have also been a much more bitter person as well and that has become a struggle to overcome on its own. 

I also have lean, anovulatory PCOS. Every part of PCOS has made me feel like a huge failure. Examples: 

1. No one took me seriously for years about PCOS because I ""don't look the same as others"" so I feel like I mourn lost time when I should have been eating better or focused on reducing cortisol levels, etc.
2. Started a 3-month course of birth control to calm my hormones down right before we started TTC. I got pregnant right away only to miscarry. It was a cruel joke. 
3. I was given a metformin prescription (although no signs of IR) but it made me feel like trash. So now I'm trying to regulate my cycles with inositol instead and it seemed to work right off the bat since my cycles were 31 and 34 days. It all came crashing down this cycle though since I'm currently sitting at CD 51 with no O in sight. Oof. Can't get pregnant if you don't ovulate! 
4. I started testing and diagnostics w/ an RE to get going on fertility meds and they are recommending going straight to IUI or IVF and won't start me with oral meds like letrozole first. I went to a new doctor to discuss letrozole and now I have an rx in hand (exactly what I wanted!) but I'm freaked about coronavirus and I don't want to start until I feel more settled.
5. The thought of getting a positive scares the shit out of me. I'm very concerned about how much anxiety will come along with a pregnancy.

Being pregnant right now would be really scary. It’s not safe to be in the hospital unless you absolutely have to and in some areas, they are cancelling all non-essential medical visits. That means no labs or ultrasounds unless the mother or baby’s life is threatened. </p>

I'm about to turn 42 and I got married almost a year ago. We conceived in January with Clomid and made it to almost 9 weeks.

I haven't talked about it with anyone outside of family and my husband, because everyone is going through stuff and I don't want to bring people down. Few people knew at all.

I guess the heart stopped beating almost two weeks ago. I found out five days ago. But my body still hasn't realised, so I'm just... Waiting. I have an appointment in a few days to schedule a d&c. This waiting period is a very unsexy place to be. I don't feel like intimacy, or friends, or drinks, or hobbies... I'm watching TV, playing games on my phone, ordering pizza. I'm on leave from work. When my husband comes home, he's amazing and supportive. He's so strong. 

I'm nearly done with pacing the house and screaming. Just another day or two, maybe.

I think I feel worse for my husband than for myself. I was reading all these groups on reddit and it made me think realistically. He wouldn't hear me say that it doesn't work out a lot of the time. I wish he hadn't seen the ultrasound. I wish I hadn't. It looked so wrong. As soon as I saw the screen, I knew, but he was still excited. He wasn't prepared at all. Our families keep checking in to see how I'm doing, but I don't think they're asking him how he's doing. 

I've been over and over those few days in my mind, that window when it happened. And I know I didn't do anything wrong. Yet I still get a nagging feeling that I did it, somehow. 

I can't wait to try again. I'm sad it won't be this year. I'm sad it won't be so close to my other friends who had, or are having, babies this year. I'm so ready. I'm so ready now.
