That may be true, but it's not the point of testing for recurrent loss, the point is to run the tests *despite* the relatively low likelihood to eliminate reason for concern moving forward. 

Additionally, the American College of Obstetrics and Gynecology recently revised it's definition of recurrent loss to two (from three) consecutive miscarriages. So, doing testing now also meets their criteria.

I did the recurrent loss panel after my second loss with my RE, and he actually encouraged me to do it. He said there was no point in waiting and that we would know what to no longer worry about moving forward.

Taken together, I would encourage you to advocate for testing at this point.

It was a terribly rough few days after the PPROM occurced early on Tuesday morning. On Tuesday night, his heart rate kept dipping. It was awful.  A team of like 8 docs came in and I thought we were going to end up in the OR with an emergency c section then. I had no epidural at that point so they were elbow deep trying to see if the cord was by his head in the birth canal or something. I wasn't having bad contractions by that point, but I still got the epi after that because the things they were having to do hurt.

 His heart dipped all night Tuesday night and after putting an interutirine tracking thing in also without epidural . Ouch!

Long night of contractions then, but i wasn't dilating fast enough and they had a team of people watching his heart rate deaccelerations all night and they finally came in around 3 am on Wednesday and recommended a c section. It all happened soooo fast. Section went well and he came out crying!

Brian went to NICU with him and I honestly haven't seen them much in the last 27  hours. THey tried to take me to see him in the NICU a few hours after section, but I was so sick it didn't last. I touched his hand and belly and almost puked so they took me to my room.

I was so out of it yesterday. lots of pain meds and anti nausea drugs and I couldn't even hold water down.  Tried to go down to see him at 10 pm Wednesday night but almost passed out, they gave me an anti nausea med and I slept until 1 am this morning.

I had been pumping all day yesterday and they pumped me while I was passed out (couldn't stay awake to save my life), and so far my milk has been enough to keep him fed. They are planning to do a feeding tube today maybe. He is breathing on his own though! 

I went at 1:30 am to see him and it was amazing. He has big bright eyes and he is huge! 19in long, 7lb 2 oz.  Beautiful boy. August  Bernard. 

Sorry I couldn't keep you all posted. things were crazy around here. Hoping I get to see him again soon. I've been preparing for things to go down this away the entire pregnancy- like I knew that I wouldn't get to be with him but Dad would, so I'm actually  handling being away from him really well.

take care everyone.  Will keep you posted.  ",[],,t1_dfb2l7q,False,0,[],False,"<div class=""md""><p>Friends, Gus is here! It was a terribly rough few days after the PPROM occurced early on Tuesday morning. On Tuesday night, his heart rate kept dipping. It was awful.  A team of like 8 docs came in and I thought we were going to end up in the OR with an emergency c section then. I had no epidural at that point so they were elbow deep trying to see if the cord was by his head in the birth canal or something. I wasn&#39;t having bad contractions by that point, but I still got the epi after that because the things they were having to do hurt.</p>

<p>His heart dipped all night Tuesday night and after putting an interutirine tracking thing in also without epidural . Ouch!</p>

<p>Long night of contractions then, but i wasn&#39;t dilating fast enough and they had a team of people watching his heart rate deaccelerations all night and they finally came in around 3 am on Wednesday and recommended a c section. It all happened soooo fast. Section went well and he came out crying!</p>

<p>Brian went to NICU with him and I honestly haven&#39;t seen them much in the last 27  hours. THey tried to take me to see him in the NICU a few hours after section, but I was so sick it didn&#39;t last. I touched his hand and belly and almost puked so they took me to my room.</p>

<p>I was so out of it yesterday. lots of pain meds and anti nausea drugs and I couldn&#39;t even hold water down.  Tried to go down to see him at 10 pm Wednesday night but almost passed out, they gave me an anti nausea med and I slept until 1 am this morning.</p>

<p>I had been pumping all day yesterday and they pumped me while I was passed out (couldn&#39;t stay awake to save my life), and so far my milk has been enough to keep him fed. They are planning to do a feeding tube today maybe. He is breathing on his own though! </p>

<p>I went at 1:30 am to see him and it was amazing. He has big bright eyes and he is huge! 19in long, 7lb 2 oz.  Beautiful boy. August  Bernard. </p>

<p>Sorry I couldn&#39;t keep you all posted. things were crazy around here. Hoping I get to see him again soon. I&#39;ve been preparing for things to go down this away the entire pregnancy- like I knew that I wouldn&#39;t get to be with him but Dad would, so I&#39;m actually  handling being away from him really well. My sister held him before me (with our permission) and that went well too. He did better with her in there because she sounds like me and they said he thought she was me :)</p>

<p>Just trying to get more adjusted to meds so I can spend more time at NICU. </p>

<p>take care everyone.  Will keep you posted.  </p>

But I'm frustrated, sad, and I just need people who understand what I'm thinking/feeling about this. Friends and family just don't get it.

My first trip to the OB after finding out I was pregnant the first time, my OB noticed my thyroid was enlarged - blood work came back normal, so not even that was a cause of miscarriage - and referred me to get an ultrasound on it. That office sucked because after two weeks I had to call back and ask for one... and didn't get the results until about a month later after I asked and was met with an, ""oh, there was an abnormality, so we're getting you a referral to get with an endocrinologist."" Fabulous. Thanks for letting me know before (totally emailed and bitched out the office -- abnormality with not a word from the office or a referral without my prompting). 

My appointment was Monday. Turns out I have a 5cm nodule sitting pretty on my left thyroid gland. Found out I don't have cancer yesterday (yay!), but I have to get surgery to remove it before it really starts making swallowing hard. Doctor recommended getting it before getting pregnant again, as he's concerned it might grow faster or just get problematic for me while pregnant and surgery would be off the table.

So. Now I have to wait to get this surgery, which will likely be several months away. He's getting me in with the best surgeon, so she's busy and there's a wait list. 

I'm just *so angry*. My body just... sucks. I have epilepsy, migraines, nonstop headaches (15+ a month),  miscarriages, and now my thyroid has to be partially or totally removed. I hate this. I wanted to wait a month or two, but I liked knowing we had an option to try again sooner if we wanted to. Now it's off the table completely, period, not optional.

I want a kid, y'all. I've wanted a baby forever. We had a set in stone plan 2, 2.5 years ago, and the wait felt like an eternity. It's supposed to be in my grasp now. Hell, right now I'm supposed to be in my second trimester, giddily awaiting to feel my little thing hopping around. Instead I'm very much not pregnant and awaiting surgery. :| 

Everything sucks. I'm sorry if this isn't the right place to post; I just don't know where else to go.

It's really hard to ""know"" when to stop trying...and different for everyone. I'd say that isn't a question to need to decide on right now, as you're still in the trenches of this current pregnancy. Nobody can make decisions like that while hurting this much. And unfortunately that decision is often based on ""how much pain can you take?""...which sucks and nobody REALLY KNOWS what the answer is. I keep going/trying because I want a child so badly that the desire still currently outweighs all my grief. But I'm close to stopping myself, as its taking over my life and filling it with sadness. Somewhere in there is a balance that you have to figure out. It is so hard and I'm sorry you have to even wonder this.

It's hard to say what is causing your losses and can't automatically be blamed on your age. But you're right -- the woman's age is a huge factor. Unfortunately it's hard to say how your eggs are, quality-wise, without doing IVF. If all your other bloodwork came back normal, I can see why you'd find that conclusion. I can relate to that, unfortunately. Inconclusive bloodwork does make it hard to decide what to do going forward, as its like playing roulette with your body. 

Being in ""loss limbo"" is terrible. Once you have that, its easier to grieve and then make the big decisions. I hope that your next scan/betas give you some closure, at a minimum.

HUGS!!!

But I just wanted to chime in as well.

You are definitely not alone. I'm almost five months out from my son's death. The first few months were SO raw and difficult. I couldn't envision the future. I didn't want to. I simply didn't want to go on. I went from a very optimistic, positive person to sometimes suicidal and very depressed. I'm now starting to feel slowly like myself, more and more. I'm starting to get interested in living again, working, bettering myself. 

I would tell you to simply put one foot in front of the other. Find a balance. Be patient with yourself and take really, really good care of yourself. You can't expect to suddenly find joy right now. You are grieving, you lost your beloved child, and you need to feel your grief. You need to let yourself grieve. But you have to be careful to not allow it to be the only thing you do. If you have a hobby you enjoy, do it to pass the time. Get busy with something that makes you feel good and productive. Distract yourself with a new movie, show, or book. See a friend that you feel is understanding. Have a date night with your husband. Do something, anything that makes you feel like you're living a somewhat normal life. Something that made you feel good before your horrible loss.

Life will be worth living again. Someday we will all feel genuine happiness again. Not today, not tomorrow--but someday. If you don't give up, if you keep trying to live, little by little, you will get there. This is such a difficult journey, the hardest road anyone could be made to walk.

The test line can get darker and then lighter before a true positive.). Now I just use the Wondfos. Tend to use them in the morning since most surges happen overnight, but if I'm worried about missing a surge I can test at night too and not worry about the cost.

I'm never just gonna be happy. I used to think if I just achieved everything I needed to that once I had a husband and my daughter, Julia I would be happy and that was it. Like Julia was my period to my life story and I would just be happily ever after. That's why I am so heart broken and sad and feel doom because my last piece to my happily ever after is gone. 

But there's no point or there's not something that happens or something you get then happiness will be the end results. Happiness and all our emotions are temporary. 

Things happen and we are hopefully able to connect them as life goes on and I know I don't get Julia but I'm having mini dots of understanding life and learning how to grieve gracefully. This will make me more of a fierce woman and mother one day. And one day I'll take the different ebbs and flows of emotions gracefully.  Because if everything is temporary...live in the moment. 

We think death of this taboo subject and it's such a far away subject but it really isnt. My heart could stop beating and boom. I'm there. It's really a fine line if you think about it. 

I wanna be a mom. I always picture Jeffrey and I with kids and Julia watching us. I want this experience to have people and my future kids see me and they realize they can do anything and to really love life for everything.  When you're sad it's okay to be sad in healthy doses and to be happy is such a sweet emotion it's overwhelming it can even bring tears to my eyes. Like the love I have for Julia and Jeffery is so overwhelming. And all emotions are that much pure and accepted.

<p>But there&#39;s no point or there&#39;s not something that happens or something you get then happiness will be the end results. Happiness and all our emotions are temporary. </p>

<p>Things happen and we are hopefully able to connect them as life goes on and I know I don&#39;t get Julia but I&#39;m having mini dots of understanding life and learning how to grieve gracefully. This will make me more of a fierce woman and mother one day. And one day I&#39;ll take the different ebbs and flows of emotions gracefully.  Because if everything is temporary...live in the moment. </p>

<p>We think death of this taboo subject and it&#39;s such a far away subject but it really isnt. My heart could stop beating and boom. I&#39;m there. It&#39;s really a fine line if you think about it. </p>

<p>I wanna be a mom. I always picture Jeffrey and I with kids and Julia watching us. I want this experience to have people and my future kids see me and they realize they can do anything and to really love life for everything.  When you&#39;re sad it&#39;s okay to be sad in healthy doses and to be happy is such a sweet emotion it&#39;s overwhelming it can even bring tears to my eyes. Like the love I have for Julia and Jeffery is so overwhelming. And all emotions are that much pure and accepted.</p>

<p>I hope this can help you in some way. You&#39;re not alone. </p>

I'm finally able to post here. I've lurked on the alumni threads for a while, mostly for inspiration to see how you all do it and hoping that one day I'll join you. I'm only 13DPO and got my first faint positive 2 days ago. The line has been getting darker - whoohoo - but it's still pretty faint. Went in for my first beta today and should have results this afternoon. I am beyond happy that I am pregnant (so weird to say/write this) but for every bit of excitement there is an equal amount of dread. I'm dreading that the line is not dark enough, that it will end the same way, my boobs hurt less today so, of course, in my mind this is a bad sign. I keep POAS nearly every time I go to pee just to make sure the line is still there. Yesterday I peed on over 11 tests (I can only find 11, but I know there were more I took and placed around the house). It's crazy how much worry there already is. Every time I eat/ drink something I get this moment of panic: ""what if this will have a bad effect on the developing embryo?"" I'm finishing my prenatal vitamins and will have to buy new ones and I spent hours yesterday reading ingredients of different brands, especially those that have folate, trying to find the one brand with best ingredients/dosage ratio. Found out vitamin D should be consumed in an amount of over 1,000iu! (up to 4000) whereas most prenatal vitamins only have 400. Then I think to myself: what other things I'm unaware of ... So I go and buy 1000mcg chewable vitamin D and take one and then immediately go to check all the ingredients and one of them is sorbitol! So off I go to google to see if sorbitol can have a negative effect on early pregnancy.  Sooooo many questions and decisions and fears. On the other hand, my temp was higher today than it's been all week, and I have a second line that's looking darker (but still faint)! I am pregnant right now! I'm sooooo happy about it. And then back to the fears. Does this kind of cycle of excitement interlaced with worry ever end? In your experience did it get better with time or worse or the same?

I&#39;ve lurked on the alumni threads for a while, mostly for inspiration to see how you all do it and hoping that one day I&#39;ll join you. I&#39;m only 13DPO and got my first faint positive 2 days ago. The line has been getting darker - whoohoo - but it&#39;s still pretty faint. Went in for my first beta today and should have results this afternoon. I am beyond happy that I am pregnant (so weird to say/write this) but for every bit of excitement there is an equal amount of dread. I&#39;m dreading that the line is not dark enough, that it will end the same way, my boobs hurt less today so, of course, in my mind this is a bad sign. I keep POAS nearly every time I go to pee just to make sure the line is still there. Yesterday I peed on over 11 tests (I can only find 11, but I know there were more I took and placed around the house). It&#39;s crazy how much worry there already is. Every time I eat/ drink something I get this moment of panic: &quot;what if this will have a bad effect on the developing embryo?&quot; I&#39;m finishing my prenatal vitamins and will have to buy new ones and I spent hours yesterday reading ingredients of different brands, especially those that have folate, trying to find the one brand with best ingredients/dosage ratio. Found out vitamin D should be consumed in an amount of over 1,000iu! (up to 4000) whereas most prenatal vitamins only have 400. Then I think to myself: what other things I&#39;m unaware of ... So I go and buy 1000mcg chewable vitamin D and take one and then immediately go to check all the ingredients and one of them is sorbitol! So off I go to google to see if sorbitol can have a negative effect on early pregnancy.  Sooooo many questions and decisions and fears. On the other hand, my temp was higher today than it&#39;s been all week, and I have a second line that&#39;s looking darker (but still faint)! I am pregnant right now! I&#39;m sooooo happy about it. And then back to the fears. Does this kind of cycle of excitement interlaced with worry ever end? In your experience did it get better with time or worse or the same?</p>

<p>I have no idea how I&#39;ll manage it all the way (if there is an all the way).. I really really hope I will be able to stay with all of you here in these Alumni threads for all 9 months. &lt;3</p>

I hope that things pick up soon. My MFM is on duty tonight so I hope he delivers tonight. I may even have time for second steroid shot tomorrow.

I went to my OB today because my MFM wanted me to take one more blood test to be on the safe side-- for Anticardiolipid Antibodies. I don't think she expects me to test positive for it but I really really appreciated how careful she is being with all of this. I need a doctor that's going to be cautious. 

I called her office and left a message yesterday mentioning I did a DNA test and found I was positive for MTHFR Compound Heterozygous. Wanted to see if she thought I should have treatment for it. I felt like such a nuisance after I left that message because I've been asking questions left and right. Today I feel better about it because at least I know I'm doing everything I possibly can to make sure I'm safe for a future pregnancy--everything in my control.

At the OB office today I expected lots of sadness and triggers. I actually had a pleasant experience. I was surprised. I think all my trauma will be at L&D, because that's where I learned Riyad was dead, not at the OB. The staff is so freaking polite and the atmosphere is so calm there. Made me think that maybe I will go back to them and go to my MFM for scans and NSTs. I haven't decided yet though.

I felt like I was being a crazy paranoid person with all of these tests but today my mood is different. I sort of feel relieved and more at peace with things since I'm actively making sure things are OK. And if I'm crazy when I'm pregnant again--who the hell can blame me? I had a full term stillbirth. So everyone can just STFU and deal with it.

I also started thinking that my son's stillbirth is truly something out of my control and I'm doing everything IN my control to deal with the aftermath of the situation. At least that's comforting.

Ovulation wise, I tested low yesterday too. It's supposed to be my fertile period. My only peak was at CD 9 and I'm now at CD 19. Maybe I just ovulate really early?

<p>I get why they want to wait, but I&#39;d much rather know if I&#39;m going to miscarry rather than have them wait just because I might.</p>

First of all, a friend from across the country has announced she is coming for a week-long visit in June. Not staying with me, thankfully, but she has a history of just announcing she's coming for visits and expects people to adjust their schedules/lives to spend time with her. I told her ""I'm really not sure what to expect with a one-month-old, but I'm happy to see you when I can"" and she said she wants to come over and spend lots of time with me and the baby. After talking to my mom and some mom friends, I know I need to set some firm boundaries about how much time I have free to see her, so that it's not overwhelming.

The second is on a whole different level. In mid-June (incidentally around the same time as my friend's visit), my husband will be leaving on a two-month army training course. I've known for a long time this would probably happen, and I'm at peace with it--he needs this course to get promoted to the next rank, he's tried to take it in the past but got bumped off or had to cancel due to life circumstances, and we agreed this is honestly the best time for him to take it, when our kid is young and immobile and I'm home with him anyway. But of course, I'm nervous about being on my own, and sad that he'll miss two months of our son's young life. Thankfully both my parents and in-laws are happy to take me in as much as I need, so I may not spend much time at home. I'm nervous about post-partum depression if I'm on my own too much.

 Unfortunately, I can't really celebrate. warning: rant about chronic pain and way too much information about rheumatoid arthritis ahead.

So, yesterday afternoon I went from ""exhausted"" to ""really annoyed"". Thankfully, I have learned that this means I might need to check my body. Checked, found that my wrists and finger joints really hurt. Thought some more and realized that yep, this has been lurking for at least two days, I was just distracted. Oh the joys of chronic pain conditions.

Isn't pregnancy supposed to stop rheumatoid arthritis? Apparently my immune system has decided that it won't be kept down by those ridiculous, feeble pregnancy hormones and now it's time to shred my joint capsules.

I'm at work now and it's not better and my jaw is starting to hurt. That's how it always starts (my flares are usually limited to wrists, fingers and jaw - unfortunately, I work as a software developer and like eating solid food...).

Normally, my options would be high dose ibuprofen (3*800mg a day) and/or steroids.

Ibuprofen is recommended against in pregnancy, in a bit of a ""better safe than sorry"" way because the studies are not consistent. But since we're talking about high dose use for at least a week, that's out. My usual prescription painkillers are also out because they actually harm the baby.

Steroids in high doses are the one thing that rheumatologists say is okay, obstetricians seem to not like it, though because of the risk of IUGR and other stuff like that (they are after all given to mature the lungs for premature labor, etc - definitely have an effect on the baby!). However, the last time I took them the side effects were worse enough to make me get a sick note for over a week (insomnia, mania, then crashed into depression).

And that's it. Other than that, it's just rest, ice/heat as feels good and waiting it out. Which I am of course prepared to do for the well-being of the baby.

I ate a good amount, but not 20 courses worth or anything, and at the end of the meal I suddenly felt so full, like my stomach was going to literally burst (with full abdominal distension). I went to pee, and the pain in my upper abdomen started. It was *horrifyingly intense*. I also knew for some reason that I'd see blood when I wiped, and sure as shit there was a lot of bright red blood.

I went back to the table, as calmly as I could, and whispered to my husband that we needed to leave, *immediately* and grabbed my jacket. 2 of the 3 family members with us have no idea I'm pregnant. As soon as we got outside the pain got even worse. I was nearly doubled over and just trying to walk the 2 blocks to our hotel but was majorly freaking out and starting to have a panic attack. We ended up in emergency and they saw me right away. As I was sitting (leaning back so my abdomen was less bent), the pain slowly started to lessen. I got a pelvic exam (still bleeding but not as much) and ultrasound and much to my surprise little hazelnut is alive and well.

[/s] There had been two occasions where I did a kick count and baby was really sluggish, and with my husband not being home all weekend and my anxiety mounting, I decided it was silly not to go to the hospital and get things checked out. My mom came and drove me and, of course, troll baby started kicking while we were waiting to be seen. His NST results looked ""spectacular"" according to the nurses, and the doctor said they were even better than they usually expect from a 33-weeker. I'm glad my kid is excelling; I just want him to keep reassuring me! 

On the bright side, I got to see L&D, which I wouldn't have seen otherwise because we declined prenatal classes. (We were living in a different city when we had Isaac.) So that was nice. Heard a baby start crying immediately after birth and I got all teary, but not in a bad way, which is a big thing for me, I think.

[/s] There had been two occasions where I did a kick count and baby was really sluggish, and with my husband not being home all weekend and my anxiety mounting, I decided it was silly not to go to the hospital and get things checked out. My mom came and drove me and, of course, troll baby started kicking while we were waiting to be seen. His NST results looked &quot;spectacular&quot; according to the nurses, and the doctor said they were even better than they usually expect from a 33-weeker. I&#39;m glad my kid is excelling; I just want him to keep reassuring me! </p>

<p>On the bright side, I got to see L&amp;D, which I wouldn&#39;t have seen otherwise because we declined prenatal classes. (We were living in a different city when we had Isaac.) So that was nice. Heard a baby start crying immediately after birth and I got all teary, but not in a bad way, which is a big thing for me, I think.

I can't be sure if it caused my miscarriages as I've had no luck with TTC since starting the treatment but I'm hoping that every little helps but I did notice that since starting treatment the near constant spotting I was having stopped, also high TSH is also linked to ovarian cysts which will hinder your fertility so I wouldn't wait.

Anyway, there is some research that shows it's best not to wait too long; that you have a better chance of a successful pregnancy within 6 months of a miscarriage. They typically only say to wait a month to help them determine due date (if you were to get pregnant right away). I say listen to your gut and your body and if it feels good to start right away, then do so. It is ultimately your body and your choice, even if they recommend 2 months (for whatever reason).

I was diagnosed with Hashimoto's hypothyroidism a little over 10 years ago. Part of that journey included meeting with leading expert in the disease at Johns Hopkins when I got some scary biopsy results. The Hashimoto's incarnation is more common in women, and it is an autoimmune dysfunction where you are producing antibodies that attack your thyroid, and it may or may not be low functioning to begin with. When this happens, we see elevated thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH), because your body's biofeedback loop is telling your thyroid to do more (TSH is just the messenger). Because your TSH levels have recently changed, it may or may not yet be detectable in T3 or T4 levels.

For me, it was not an issue in my miscarriages, because it was known and being treated. First, my OB coordinated with my endocrinologist, now I work with a reproductive endocrinologist (RE) and they monitor these levels. My RE wants my TSH levels at 2.5 or less. If your doctor won't treat anything above 10, it's time for a second opinion and/or a new doctor. Your levels indicate sub-clinical hypothyroidism, but the change and your experience of a miscarriage recently should indicate reason for concern. Increasingly, sub-clinical hypothyroidism is being treated with low doses of levothyroxine (Synthroid) for reproduction and quality of life (that shit makes you really tired, and fueled depression for me). I'm not sure which doctors you are working with right now, but I would make an appointment with an endocrinologist (you probably don't yet meet criteria for when to see an RE). That way when you do conceive again you can have them monitor your thyroid levels, too, usually if you are on levothyroxine you need more during pregnancy.

Last night I had a dream about my mom trying to find me, and we had moved away and I got rid of my phone so she couldn't.... I have a good relationship with my mom and talk on the phone almost every day, but she has been driving me seriously crazy lately. I feel like she's trying to one up my entire pregnancy and if she didn't do something that I plan on doing, her way is better because my sister and I survived to be living proof of that. I gained 15lbs as of my 24 week appointment, right on target according to my dr. Well my mom only gained 15 her whole pregnancy and I weighed almost 9 of that. She knows I don't go for a walk if I get home from work and it's dark because I don't trust my neighborhood that much. She walked every day the whole 9 months! I find this very hard to believe as she had HG, the majority of her pregnancy with me would have been through winter in Buffalo NY, and I feel like it probably wasn't even recomended to exercise during pregnancy 30 years ago... Complain about doing laundry? She does it every day! Don't I know it's so simple to just put a load in every day? We Plan on having the baby next to me in the pack n play bassinet for at least 3 months and my mom is all ""why did we buy you a crib then? You and your sister slept in the crib from the start and you survived!""

Oh and my fav... so after she decided she didn't like our name choice because it sounds similar to my nieces name and we still are going to use it, now she doesn't like it because her friends have kids with that name (it was a popular name in the 80s and 90s but it's not anymore). Her friends from high school's kids that I have never met, that she probably doesn't talk to anymore because she moved across the country, have used my baby name 25 years ago so I can't! 

Sorry this turned into more of a rant than I intended. At least she lives 4 hours away! Ugh... Anyways! Hope everyone has a good day!

<p>Tomorrow is my second loss anniversary. Both of my anniversaries are on holidays. It&#39;s really hard to &quot;forget&quot; them. I knew that my shower was going to be planned for the same weekend. I get all teary eyed thinking about making it through the shower without losing it at some point. I&#39;m trying to focus on enjoying my time home and how active LO is. I don&#39;t think I&#39;ll ever feel 100% with this pregnancy until it&#39;s all over and baby is in my arms. I definitely feel more confident that this <em>could</em> be a take home baby but we all know that is not a guarantee. (sigh) I&#39;ll be eating my emotions this weekend.

<p>I&#39;m used to some insomnia, but since I&#39;m pregnant it has taken an annoying form - used to be that I was just awake and couldn&#39;t sleep, or that I was worrying about something. Now I&#39;m not and I&#39;m so, so tired and just can&#39;t fall asleep. </p>

<p>Oh, and I was so, so glad that I have never thrown up during pregnancy (I have some psychological problems with it). Two days ago, I threw up because I was drinking water too fast, and yesterday because I choked a bit and the coughing made my spaghetti come up again. So much for that. PSA: throwing up spaghetti is really gross. </p>

<p>In good news, I cleared out my OPKs yesterday and offered them up as a give away. Even if this pregnancy fails, I won&#39;t need them anyway, as then I&#39;d be Done. Also, it&#39;s great weather outside so I plan on sitting in the garden, and I have tickets for the opera for the evening. Kid is getting to listen to some music ;-)</p>

I'm 38w1d today. I've been at the hospital every day for the last week (except Sunday) with symptoms of preeclampsia, except I have ""immaculate"" blood pressure, and nothing more than a trace of protein.


(Yeah, it's not preeclampsia, but they're not sure what to make of me as I've had PE with both of my previous births)


I had an ultrasound yesterday which showed that the placenta and umbilical cord are in the first stages of failing. I have another scan tomorrow to check the cord, but I think my plans for a spontaneous birth are kaput. I feel like the doctor I saw yesterday was giving me the option of induction, but her supervisor said we could give bub a couple of days, which I was OK with. Bub is still hanging out in there, wriggling around, so while she's doing that, I'm still happy that she is all right.


I was trying to eavesdrop on the doctor's conversation about me, but the pregnant lady next to me started chatting about how my bump is too small, so I missed what was said. Also, my bump is massive and bub is 50th percentile, so shush random lady.


Anyway, I woke up today and I feel done. I'm exhausted. I am too hot, and I am just sore, so if they suggest induction at my appointment tomorrow, I'm going to jump on it. I'm not going to get a medal for going into labour naturally, and the longer this pregnancy goes, the more potential for things to go wrong, and I've only ever been induced so what I'm not going to miss what I've never had.

I had an embryo, not a blighted ovum, but it stopped growing around 6 weeks and we found out at the 11 week ultrasound. The options are so daunting! They were presented to me on the same day and I figured I'd want time to think it over.

But a day later I realized that for me, feeling pregnant while I knew it wasn't viable was one of the most awful feelings I've ever had to deal with and I just wanted it over ASAP. I opted for a suction D&C, just had it today. I'm sad but I also feel some relief that it's over.

I was given the three options mentioned by others -- wait it out, take cytotec/misoprostol, or suction d&c. If you don't want to wait it out, I would ask about the risks of cytotec vs. the d&c. My midwife said my chances of completing the miscarriage were a lot better with the d&c, I think in part because I hadn't bled at all. Your situation is probably different because you did have bleeding, and I'm not sure if the blighted ovum may change it too? The doctor should know.

Another consideration is cost. Again, if you don't want to wait it out, then the other options will probably cost you and in most cases the procedure is probably more expensive than the medication.

Your OB will likely give you three options- misoprostol, natural, or d&c. You will hear lots of different stories about misoprostol. I am one of those people that it works well for, I've had to take it twice now and for me the pain is easily managed with Motrin and a heating pad and I appreciate the ability to dictate when my miscarriage happens without doing invasive surgery. For natural, you may be waiting around for it to happen for a few days to a few weeks. For D&C you also chose when it happens on your terms, but it's invasive, expensive and there's a small risk of scarring or cervical incompetence in the future. Never less many women prefer D&Cs because of the immediate closure of having it all taken out at once.

Blighted Ovums account for 50% of all miscarriages so they're pretty common. All current evidence points to it being a random chromosomal abnormality, which is usually a one time occurrence for most women.

Regarding your question - it can take a lot longer than you might hope or expect. I know it may be next to impossible, but try to focus on healing and allowing your body to return to normal when it is ready rather than on trying and conceiving again. Granted, I have some experiences that inform that suggestion, I have had two MMCs and it has taken me at least a year to conceive after each. It's just that I have found that the process of bargaining with myself regarding getting pregnant again as a way to get over my losses has consistently backfired and made my path to wellness a lot thornier. 

Also, just to be sure, did you test your beta levels down to zero after your D&C? I had a D&C following my first loss (found out at 10w that it had stopped at 8w).

<p>Regarding your question - it can take a lot longer than you might hope or expect. I know it may be next to impossible, but try to focus on healing and allowing your body to return to normal when it is ready rather than on trying and conceiving again. Granted, I have some experiences that inform that suggestion, I have had two MMCs and it has taken me at least a year to conceive after each. It&#39;s just that I have found that the process of bargaining with myself regarding getting pregnant again as a way to get over my losses has consistently backfired and made my path to wellness a lot thornier. </p>

<p>Also, just to be sure, did you test your beta levels down to zero after your D&amp;C? I had a D&amp;C following my first loss (found out at 10w that it had stopped at 8w). I had what I thought was a first period followed by increasingly shorter cycles, got a positive OPK when I thought I should ovulate, but it was turning positive because I had retained products from the D&amp;C and OPKs come back positive when you have any amount of HCG in your system.

If that little embryo is still alive inside of me, this is the most pregnant I've ever been. (Made it to 10 weeks twice, but they did not.) I was the sickest I have been yet yesterday but (knock on wood) feeling pretty good today. Still a little crampy and headachy but yesterday I felt like the hangover from hell and I cried because I was too sick to walk the dogs and felt guilty. Pregnancy is so glamorous. 

My anxiety is so much less after seeing the heartbeat, but I still wonder if everything is okay. I think I have almost come to terms with the fact that maybe the first 2 were just actual flukes and that there isn't something majorly wrong with me. Part of me wants to ask for another u/s, but I also don't want the anxiety that comes before that, so I think I will hold off. 

I go to the midwives in 3 weeks...I'll be 10+4...what are the odds of hearing a heartbeat with the doppler at that point? Last time I was 9w when they tried and they said 50/50 shot, but there was no heartbeat to find, so just wondering. 

Also haven't shared this with anyone but there was some slight disappointment after the u/s that there weren't twins. I've always thought twins would be cool and I feel robbed of my chance. Although I couldn't use the birth center if I was carrying twins and that's something I really want to do, so it's not the end of the world. Feel super bratty for even thinking it, but that's life.

Please do not lose hope.

Most early miscarriages tend to be linked to chromosomal abnormalities - typically an imbalance when the cells are going through division.  There's nothing we can really do to prevent it and it's random (each new pregnancy somewhat resets the odds), although advanced maternal and paternal age do contribute to the risk.

I would suggest having a discussion with your OB as to their recommendation for being referred to a fertility specialist - IVF with embryo DNA analysis can ensure that the chromosomal numbers are normal, thereby increasing chance of success.  These specialists will also go through extensive list of factors that could be contributing to pregnancy loss and will evaluate you for it.

<p>Please do not lose hope.</p>

<p>Most early miscarriages tend to be linked to chromosomal abnormalities - typically an imbalance when the cells are going through division.  There&#39;s nothing we can really do to prevent it and it&#39;s random (each new pregnancy somewhat resets the odds), although advanced maternal and paternal age do contribute to the risk.</p>

The number of days after ovulation is what counts for determine when to test, and the odds that the test is a true negative/positive (false positives are ridiculously rare, no real concern there). *Puts on former HS biology/chemistry teacher hat.*

The first part of your cycle is the follicular phase, dictated by estrogen, when the follicles develop and antral follicles compete to see which will complete development and be released. The length of this phase can vary quite a lot, and is typically nothing to worry about unless it is way too short and the lining does not get to develop enough. The reason that you may read that the average person ovulates around day 14 is because that is the average length of the follicular phase - but that is a population statistic, so individuals will ovulate at different times, with some within person variability (i.e., despite the average, most people do not ovulate on CD14).

After ovulation occurs is the luteal phase, there is much less variation in the length of this phase both between and within individuals. This is because there should be a lot more predictability about what happens here in terms of time for the egg to travel down the fallopian tube, potentially be fertilized, and implant (or not). Once you get to know the length of your luteal phase, it is a lot easier to predict when your period will occur. Just look at when you get a positive OPK and count to CD1. Chances are good that if your cycle length does vary that the source of that variation is more in the follicular phase (before ovulation).

Like some of the other stuff just feels like nesting, but the things I'm doing now are true ""baby will be born soon enough that these things have to be done"" type things.  I am of course nervous (and so hopeful- this baby comes home, damnit!), but so incredibly hopeful.  I'm starting to believe that he will need those cleaned bottles.  That he will need his pack and play to be set up on the main level of the house.  That his cradle sheet needs to be washed so that it can be put on the mattress when he comes home.

This entire pregnancy, I prepared for trauma. First for a micro-preemie (and the potential that they could die like Scarlet did), then a regular preemie, then a later preemie; and it's hitting me that I am very likely to have a  ""normal"" full-term baby.

I'm not out of the woods yet, but if Gus came today, he would likely only have 4-6 weeks in the NICU with no lasting disabilities.  I'm trying to focus on the conditions we are managing with my medical team and not on the other terrible things that can happen in the last trimester.  I'm still not assuming that everything will go smoothly, but it feels so good to do some of the ""final"" preparation that I worried I'd be superstitious about. I'm not feeling superstitious, which surprises and delights me. 

Yesterday I ordered a 3 pack of absorbent liners to put on top of the cradle sheet, in the pack and play, on the changing pad, etc. for messes and I was almost giddy thinking- Gus is going to shit all over and have messes and I can't wait!  Normal pregnant women have no clue how that feels. To look at a photo on the mantle of your dead daughter placed next to her urn and think about how awesome it would be to be cleaning up her messes instead of longing for her to be here <3

""I have to tell you this.

You didn‚Äôt fail. Not even a little.

You are not a horrible mother.

You didn‚Äôt choose this. You didn‚Äôt want this to happen. You didn‚Äôt do anything wrong. It just happened. To you. Despite your begging, pleading, praying, hoping against all hope it would not. Even though everything within you was screaming no, no, no, no, no.

God didn‚Äôt do this to punish you, smite you, or to teach you a lesson. That is not God‚Äôs way. You could not have prevented this if you tried harder, prayed harder, or were a ‚Äúbetter‚Äù person. Nor if you ate better, loved harder, yoga-ed more, did x, y, or z to the nth degree‚Äîfill in the blank with any other lie your mind devises. You could not have prevented this even if you could have predicted the future like no one can.

No, there is nothing more you could have done. You did everything you possibly could have. And you are the best mother there is because you would have done absolutely anything to keep your child alive. To breathe your last breath instead. To choose the pain all over again just to spend one more minute together. That is the ultimate kind of love. You are the ultimate kind of mother.

So wash your hands of any naysayers, betrayers, or those who sprinted in the other direction when you needed them most. Wash your hands of the people who may have falsely judged you, ostracized you, or stigmatized you because of what happened to you. Wash your hands of anyone who has made you feel less than by questioning everything you did or didn‚Äôt do. Anyone whose words or looks have implied this was somehow your fault.

This was not your fault. This will never be your fault, no matter how many different ways someone tries to tell you it was.

Especially if that someone happens to be you. Sometimes it‚Äôs not what others are saying that keeps you shackled in shame. Sometimes you adopt others‚Äô misguided opinions and assumptions. Sometimes it‚Äôs your own inner voice that shoves you into the darkest corner of despair, like an abuser, telling you over and over and over again you failed as a mother. Convincing you if only this and what if that, it never would have happened. Saying you coulda, shoulda done this or that so your child would not have died.

That is a lie of the sickest kind. Do not believe it, not even for a second. Do not let it sink into your bones. Do not let it smother that beautiful, beautiful light of yours.

Instead, breathe in this truth with every part of yourself: You are the best damn mother in the entire world.

No one else could do what you do. No one else could ever mother your child as well as you can, as well as you are. No one else could let your child‚Äôs love and light shine through the way you do. No one else could mother your dead child as bravely. No one else could carry this unrelenting burden as courageously. It is the heaviest, most torturous burden there is.

There is no one, no one, no one who could ever, ever replace you. No one. You were chosen to be your child‚Äôs mother. Yes‚Äîchosen. And no one could parent your child better in life or in death than you do. You have within you a sacred strength.

You are the mother of all mothers.

So breathe, mama, keep breathing. Believe, mama, keep believing. Fight, mama, keep fighting for this truth to uproot the lies in your heart‚Äîyou didn‚Äôt fail. Not even a little.

For whatever it‚Äôs worth, I see you. I hear your guttural sobs. I feel your ache deep inside my bones. And it doesn‚Äôt make me uncomfortable to put my fingers as a makeshift Band-Aid over the gaping hole in your heart until the scabs come, if and when they do.

It takes invincible strength to mother a child you can no longer hold, see, touch, or hear. You are a superhero mama. I see you fall down and get up, fall down and get up, over and over again. I notice the grit and guts it takes to pry yourself out of bed every single day and force your bloodied feet to stand up and keep walking. I see you walking this path of life you‚Äôve been given, where every breath and step apart from your child is a physical, emotional, and spiritual battleground. A fight for your own survival. A fight to quiet the insidious lies.

But the truth is, you haven‚Äôt failed at all. In fact, it‚Äôs quite the opposite.

You are the mother of all mothers.

Truly, the most inspiring, courageous, loving mother there is‚Äîa warrior mama through and through.

For even in death, you lovingly mother your precious child still."" --Angela Miller ",[],,t1_dereeic,False,0,[],False,"<div class=""md""><p>There is this poem that really inspires me. I think you will like it:</p>

<p>But the truth is, you haven‚Äôt failed at all. In fact, it‚Äôs quite the opposite.</p>

<p>You are the mother of all mothers.</p>

<p>Truly, the most inspiring, courageous, loving mother there is‚Äîa warrior mama through and through.</p>

<p>For even in death, you lovingly mother your precious child still.&quot; --Angela Miller </p>

The one thing that I did notice from reading the websites of these practices, is it seems like the Fertility Clinics here really are geared more towards people buying IVF packages, and I really wish we had recurrent miscarriage-only clinics here, like they do in the U.K.

So here's where I'm at now: I've done the standard clotting/antibody/hormone tests, all normal, and I have an 'unremarkable' uterus. I've had two miscarriages - one with an embryo that stopped growing at 6 weeks, and one blighted ovum that stopped at 5, both missed; so slightly different kinds of losses which may not have a related cause?

I'm not keen on putting off TTC til July. I'll be almost 32 then... and I'm not really sure if seeing this specialist will genuinely help us.
Husband is suggesting that maybe we should keep the appointment and just try to get pregnant again in the interim. Go to it anyway when the time comes.

I'm torn... what would you do in this situation? I'm so tired of putting my life on hold over and over but also, don't want to tumble facefirst into another devastating loss.

I hate how much time at work I spend procrastinating.  And I hate how nobody at work ever asks me how I am. It's probably to be expected at a 90-95 percent male workplace, but it's not like I want a lot of attention- just someone asking me how I feel.

We are all doing good and are looking forward to the first Christmas where Matthew is so AMPED ABOUT SANTA and we get to hang out with family. Will probably take a technology break for a bit and enjoy it!

<p>&quot;Hi all! Phil and I thought we would put the word out that we lost the baby at 18 weeks. Since we announced that we were expecting on here, we thought we better unannounce it so there&#39;s no awkwardness if anyone asks how things are going. 
We hit the jackpot with Matthew so we realise we are pretty lucky - a lot of people don&#39;t even get one. 
We are all doing good and are looking forward to the first Christmas where Matthew is so AMPED ABOUT SANTA and we get to hang out with family. Will probably take a technology break for a bit and enjoy it!

_____________________________________

Since I had a lot of questions before my HSG I thought I would make an update post for how it went in case other had questions in the future. It will probably be long and super detailed.


I got to the hospital early for my appointment and I was surprised when they were able to take me in right away. I had to strip everything from the waist down and put on a gown. Standing up it covered my bum but sitting down it did not. I know this because after I changed the nurse sat me down to go over the procedure. It was kind of uncomfortable sitting on those plastic chairs with a bit of your bum in direct contact lol.


She went over the procedure, asked me some related questions. Whether or not I have been pregnant before and whether or not I have children blah blah blah. I was a bit confused though because she asked ""why are you having this test done?"". All I could think was ""um....because it will show whether or not my fallopian tubes are open?"". She looked really confused by my answer so I said ""uh, because my doctor wants to rule some options out? I don't know."". She then was like ""oh ok, people get these all the time are different points in TTC, I was just wondering...."". Like ok, was the relevant or were you just being nosy? She seemed really friendly so I wasn't too offended. I think I made her feel really awkward though when I had to explain how I had 1 pregnancy but no children. Took a minute for her to understand.


I was told they couldn't get started until the radiologist was there and then they would call my gyno. I made pleasant chat with the nurse about stuff to pass the time, but it took about 20 minutes until he showed up (the whole time with my bare bum directly on the chair). AT least they gave me a warm blanket because I was freezing.


Finally the radiologist showed up so they called my gyno....except it wasn't my gyno. It was a student resident. He asked if my gyno was Dr.L and I was like no it is Dr.S. I guess my gyno pawned the job to this guy. He seemed nice though so I wasn't too worried. Nervous but alright.


They had me lay down on the table and said to put my heels to my bum. I tried my best but I was at an awkward position. He was like ""uh I guess that will work..."". I felt embarrassed but didn't know what else to do. He then had me scooch up further on the table so my bum was on this pillow (could have told me that first thanks). I could barely get my legs up because my heels were on the corner of the bed. I had nothing to support keeping my legs in the frog position. I don't know if this was because I was fat or if I just did not understand what they wanted.


I guess it didn't matter because everything went in easily enough. He said there would be a poke (I think they did some sort of freezing? At least the nurse mentioned they might), and oh my goodness did that hurt. Needles to your cervix are not fun. The catheter insertion was really uncomfortable. I did a lot of slow deep breathes which really seemed to help.


I definitely had a moment of ""if childbirth hurts my cervix like this then maybe I don't want kids..."". That thought has already passed though. At this point they were ready to insert the dye. Still breathing through the cramps when the radiologist said he needed to adjust AND THEN JERKED THE TABLE BACK AND FORTH!!! I wanted to cry. It's not like I had things coming out of my cervix that hurt when bumped.


I got to see the screen as they did the procedure. I couldn't really tell what was happening on the screen since it was a bit dark. He would take a picture though and for a split second it would be very clear and bright. I thought that was pretty cool. My right fallopian tube spilled right away (woo), but then the radiologist said he couldn't see the left spilling.


My heart dropped a bit. I had been really worried about this. A few seconds later though he said ""oh wait there it goes!"". I am not a doctor, but I wonder if I had a small blockage in that tube the dye cleared for me. Or I have a sassy left tube. My husband joked that I must have left shark and right shark tubes [(old meme for those who may not get it)](http://imgur.com/gallery/7CZby9V).


So they basically told me that my tubes looked good and I could follow up with my obgyn. Taking everything out was only a second and they let me change. I wasn't feeling ""pain"" anymore but the cramping was definitely bad. Worse than any period I have had. My legs were shaking and I felt like I couldn't walk. By the time my husband drove me home though they were basically gone. If i moved too quick I would get a sharpish pain but it was bearable.


My boss is wonderful and told me to take the whole day off (including the next day if I needed it), so I spent the day curled up in bed with my cats watching ""Jane the Virgin"".


Overall my happiness with the good news overshadowed the bad/uncomfortable stuff. I feel like I am getting closer to answers and options. Fingers crossed I make it to CD21 and then by the new year I can be taking steps to getting and staying pregnant.
Hopefully this is helpful and if anyone has questions I would be happy to answer :)

I had been really really looking forward to getting a new puppy. One of our dogs died last year and I immediately knew I wanted another dog. We found a breeder and had been looking forward to it for months. 

We brought the puppy home and our current dog hated him. We figured that might be the case at first. We kept them separated with a baby gate, but our dog was really scared and having fear-aggression toward the puppy even when separated. 

The thought of having to keep two animals separated for years while one of them was experiencing panic was extremely distressing to me and shot my anxiety up to like 100. The puppies screams (no not whines, screams) were sending me over the edge as it was horrible, as well as making my other dog super scared. 

I seriously felt like I was going to have a nervous breakdown. So, my husband and I decided to return the puppy to the breeder. Ever since then I have felt really depressed and sad. I've been crying a lot. 

I think one of the reasons this is effecting me so much is because this puppy was going to be my baby. The puppy was a little baby I could bring home 100% for sure. I let myself get excited about it and now this puppy has been taken away from me too.

I can totally see how women, men, people can become anti doctor, anti medical intervention and testing. 
This is brought on partially from my own totally useless trimester one appointments and from experiences at work. Had a patient yesterday that really really needed some specific tests and evaluations and no one was taking her seriously in the ER. It was driving me nuts. I kept checking back up on her and coaching her and her bf on what to say so that they wouldn't kick her out before anything useful had been done. 

And it hit me, (maybe I should have had this epiphany years ago but...) If this doc screws up and this young woman walks herself to her bfs car, goes into an arrhythmia and dies, it won't really matter to him. It'll be sad, but the blame will be shifted to loads of other people, even though, in the end, the Dr is the one who had the ability to order a consult, a rhythm strip.... 

At the end of the day that ER Dr sees a billion people in a day. It's unlikely he'll remember this girl even if she has a poor outcome because of inadequate care. 


And how is she going to feel about medicine if she gets blown off at the hospital after this huge episode? 

No wonder so many women are distrustful of medical care in pregnancy. If you've been blown off a few times when you've had other scary health issues, why would you ever want to go back to the place where they blow you off and don't help you? 

If the birthing center has better bed side manner than, yeah, fuck the hospital. 

Rant over.

Today is ultrasound day. I literally spent the entire day on the couch yesterday because I felt so sick. Went to the bathroom before bed and when I wiped there was blood. More than spotting. Not quite *bright* red, but red. Cue meltdown. Put on a pad but woke up to nothing on the pad and nothing when I wipe. 

I am so sick of this up and down. 

Does anyone have any advice on how to handle the ultrasound? The first pregnancy, I was bleeding/cramping heavily so I pretty much knew it was not going to be good news. The second ultrasound I had no reason to think it wouldn't be good news and was therefore crushed. 

This time I've gone back and forth about a million times on what to expect. I plan on telling the tech that I've had two miscarriages, so can she leave the ovary measuring shit until the end...but I don't know if that's the right choice. Will I want to have to lay there for even longer if there is bad news? I've also thought about not looking until she gives me the news, but I also don't know if I can do that. Any tips or tricks would be greatly appreciated.

OMFG guys, a heartbeat!!! üíó i've never seen anything in the sac and i've definitely never seen a heartbeat. she said everything is measuring right where it should be. i literally sobbed for the rest of the u/s. i know the odds are in my favor now but i'm also not a huge fan of odds from past experience but i feel like a weight has been lifted from my chest. ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è",[],,t1_dekoqpm,False,0,[],False,"<div class=""md""><p>6+1</p>

<p>Today is ultrasound day. I literally spent the entire day on the couch yesterday because I felt so sick. Went to the bathroom before bed and when I wiped there was blood. More than spotting. Not quite <em>bright</em> red, but red. Cue meltdown. Put on a pad but woke up to nothing on the pad and nothing when I wipe. </p>

<p>I am so sick of this up and down. </p>

<p>Does anyone have any advice on how to handle the ultrasound? The first pregnancy, I was bleeding/cramping heavily so I pretty much knew it was not going to be good news. The second ultrasound I had no reason to think it wouldn&#39;t be good news and was therefore crushed. </p>

<p>This time I&#39;ve gone back and forth about a million times on what to expect. I plan on telling the tech that I&#39;ve had two miscarriages, so can she leave the ovary measuring shit until the end...but I don&#39;t know if that&#39;s the right choice. Will I want to have to lay there for even longer if there is bad news? I&#39;ve also thought about not looking until she gives me the news, but I also don&#39;t know if I can do that. Any tips or tricks would be greatly appreciated.</p>

I had one late miscarriage but I don't think that my advice will be any less applicable to helping your wife through her pregnancy. Firstly it really sucks but there is not much you can do at the beginning to reassure yourself. Taking pregnancy tests every frw days and watching the lines darken is definitely helpful. I'm not sure if it's an option but ultimately the best thing for me was having my blood drawn every 2 days and watching my B-HCG double. I also asked for multiple early USs. We had our first one in hospital at 5 weeks (had to go in for a rhogam shot due to bleeding) and then had weekly repeats until we saw a heartbeat. Seeing a HB is important because the chances of loosing your baby drop drastically after their heart is beating. I continued to have frequent USs until i felt baby moving. Once I hit 11 weeks my fetal doppler was my godsend; it allows you to hear the baby's HB at home so you know they're still ok. Once the baby starts moving the anxiety is usually a lot less for people. Keeping a journal was also incredibly therapeutic. 

Good luck with this next pregnancy. I hope it comes quickly and you and your wife are holding your baby soon. (TW: pregnancy,  while I didn't have multiple losses, a friend of mine did. She has 3 losses; a chemical pregnancy, a first trimester loss, and a second trimester loss. She is now 7 months pregnant with a healthy baby girl.

<p>I had one late miscarriage but I don&#39;t think that my advice will be any less applicable to helping your wife through her pregnancy. Firstly it really sucks but there is not much you can do at the beginning to reassure yourself. Taking pregnancy tests every frw days and watching the lines darken is definitely helpful. I&#39;m not sure if it&#39;s an option but ultimately the best thing for me was having my blood drawn every 2 days and watching my B-HCG double. I also asked for multiple early USs. We had our first one in hospital at 5 weeks (had to go in for a rhogam shot due to bleeding) and then had weekly repeats until we saw a heartbeat.

But it&#39;s been over a week since I managed to sleep more than 2 hours at a time, so I think I was sleep deprived. I switched from Zantac to Pepcid and..... acid reflux under control, I even got 5-6 hours of sleep.... Until then I started thinking &quot;What if my acid reflux is gone because this embryo has died too? What if it isn&#39;t the Pepcid?&quot; HELLO, crazy anxiety town! Hard today to remember I am pregnant until otherwise informed. Only 7 days to go until our next scan and I hope I can keep busy and manage my anxiety until then. Someday I&#39;ll feel excited about being pregnant instead of anxious, right? :( </p>

I ""get"" it rationally, but I wish medical professionals would think through the level of denial of women's experience that they may be engaging in and question what's at stake/why it's important to them. For example, what if the nurse had said something more like, ""well the pg test is negative so if you miscarried, and the physical symptoms and experience you had aligns with miscarriage experiences, then we can confirm that you were able to complete it naturally on your own.""

That's a much different message than: ""Pg test is negative, you weren't pg, you just had a heavy period."" 

I'm in my late 30s and when I mc at age 36 this past summer I still remember bristling at an exchange that was annoying: after they did a transvaginal ultrasound that showed nothing (and I had said my experience - that I had passed a large amount of tissue the day before and was only around 7w so it ""felt"" like everything was gone, I knew I had lost my pregnancy) - all of a sudden they started peppering me with multiple questions on whether I had confirmed the pregnancy with home tests and how many. It was like without visual evidence I wasn't believed fully that I had even been pregnant! 

When the blood draw showed hcg (and then the second one that it was lowering) that's when I felt like they only/fully acknowledged the loss. 

Again - I get the medical reasons for why, and I'm not saying that nurse or my practice docs and nurses needed to be falling all over us with lies/making claims they're not comfortable making... but they can show ways to trust our experience. 

Good luck with you on your ttc journey - it sounds like you've got a great partner, but keep talking to each other and keep putting yourselves in each other's perspectives to understand where you are both at.

I'm very sorry for your losses. It sounds like you have worked with your doctor on a plan to move forward. I have some experience with medicated cycles, but of course the doctor will be your main source of information

So the intuition behind Clomid for low progesterone (also why I am on medicated cycles, plus difficulty conceiving in general) is that having an extra follicle or two will generate extra progesterone. There are a couple things to keep in mind - first, that may or may not work, and people respond differently to Clomid. I would suggest requesting a mid-cycle ultrasound and a 7 DPO progesterone test. The mid-cycle ultrasound is to see how you respond to treatment. I over responded to Clomid with 7 follicles, so we were not able to try that time and have since switched to Letrozole, which has worked a lot better. Other folks may not respond, which means you would need to adjust the dosage. If you only have one follicle still, you may also need a progesterone supplement. Then, the 7 DPO progesterone blood test confirms that you did ovulate and that your progesterone levels are where they should be (over 3 confirms ovulation, over 15 is ideal). 

I am assuming your doctor has you starting on CD2 because of cycle length, but usually it is taken cycle days 3-7 or 5-9. You also may want to ask about when to call if you do not get a positive OPK. Medicated cycles can throw off OPKs. I was given directions to call if I did not get a positive OPK by day 16. That happened my cycle on Clomid when I never got a positive, but on Letrozole I ovulated early. It's hard to know which way it will go, so it's good to know what to do just in case.
