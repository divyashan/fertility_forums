I lost my first pregnancy at 9.5 weeks in May and lost my son at 14 weeks in November. It took 8 long, frustrating weeks for my period to return, and this month was the first time trying again and I am still shocked at how much it took out of me. It was all fine until after ovulation, when I just got sucked into the tide of desperation and obsessive behaviour. I’m ashamed to admit how early I started testing. I even got what I was sure was a faint positive on a FRER at around 9 dpo, but not again. I kept testing until my period finally showed two days late. I swear I felt symptoms—my nipples changed colour and I felt exhausted and nauseous.Then I just lost it and was struck by a wave of grief and negativity like you’re describing. I too had been reassuring myself with thoughts of an October baby, and simultaneously trying to talk myself out of being too hopeful. I kept testing whenever I felt hopeful to keep my expectations in check. I’m still not sure if I may have had a very early chemical or if I imagined the whole thing.

This hurts. Trying to conceive after a deep, soul-crushing loss is not the fun and hopeful activity it was just a few months ago. I am filled with anxiety and feel it’s all so out of my control. I was so broken when I finally had to admit to myself it was over. I think I’m mostly upset that getting pregnant is supposed to be the easy part. What I’m really scared about is the fear and uncertainty of yet another first trimester. All I want is just to get pregnant quickly so I can get past the uncertainty of all this as soon as possible.

If you feel this is taking over your life, you are not alone. You’ve had a very recent, devastating loss. We need to be kinder to ourselves and realize that fertility does not magically disappear one day after our 35th birthday. Yes, realistically things may not work as smoothly or predictably as they did when we were 22, but it’s not all lost. 

I’ve been trying to remind myself and my husband that grieving disappointment is part of wanting this so badly. I hate that I feel this deep sadness and loss, but I also know I have no choice but keep trying despite it, even if it is wrecking me. It’s not fair to expect yourself to shrug off a negative test after what you’ve experienced. I’m trying to consciously let go of trying to relate to others whose fertility situation is different than mine, because it just results in me thinking something is wrong with me.

But, If you’d asked me two days ago, I’d have said exactly the same things you did in your post—something is wrong with me and having a child may not be in the cards for me. The intensity of the grief I felt when my son died returned suddenly and intensely.

The way you feel today will improve. You have probably had some of the darkest days of your life in the last little while, but things always improve eventually. And they always get hard again. I wish it wasn’t cyclical, but then again I am thankful that it is, because otherwise I wouldn’t survive the pain of the lows.

I think that when we try again next cycle, I’m going to consciously cling to hope during the two week wait.  I’ll be devastated either way when I get a negative test or get my period, but at least living in hope for a few weeks might give me the break I need to regain my strength—I’ll need it to weather another disappointment.

Early or not, losing a baby is devastating. We lost ours at seven weeks and it hit us so hard. 

The only words of comfort I can offer you is to rationalize this and hold onto the one thing you have and basically confirms your body can do this. You had a successful pregnancy and gave birth to a healthy baby before. I know that right now all you can think is that you lost this one, but the existence of your son is your proof that this can and will happen for you. You have that reminder with you, every day. Take strength from that. 

And give yourself time. This won't stop hurting for quite a while. But it will gradually get better. I can understand your frustration with your husband. Could his stance be the one it is due to his own processing of his own grief? Maybe sitting down and talking to him in a positive and calm context would help. I don't know the specifics of your situation, I'm just throwing ideas here. Maybe you could consider talking to a grief counselor, or psychologist. We didn't go there but a friendly couple who went through the same thing did and it helped them so much. 

There's not much that can be said regarding your fears and anxieties. We all have them. We're worried every future pregnancy will end in a MC but chances are it won't. It's hard to believe it, but you have to remind yourself of that fact again and again. 

We're also in the TTC phase. I won't lie to you... There's no comparison to Ttc before our loss. The excitement, the positive mood, the intimacy, the craving of contact... It's not here right now. It's more procedural. And a bit restrained. Because we're both terrified that we might get through this again.  And that's normal. We've rationalised this. We've discussed about it and we realize it's kind of our psyches' self-defense mechanism. We now know how much we might hurt again. 

All in all give yourselves time and cur yourselves some slack. I'm told by women who have gone through this and have had successful pregnancies later that it gets better. That's really the only thing we can hope fore. Focus on the positive aspects of your life. Try not to overstress about conception and hopefully you will soon have your rainbow baby on the way.

First off, this can feel really isolating. Know that there are people out there that understand, and don’t be afraid to reach out to them. I personally found a lot of support here, and at ending a wanted pregnancy. I had a very similar situation. First pregnancy at 30, unplanned, but we were excited and everything seemed perfect. 

At our 20 week scan, the ventricles in his brain were measuring too large. After two weeks of genetic tests, scans and meeting with specialists, there were no good outcomes from the rapid growth. I ended up having a D&E. So, it went pretty fast from anatomy scan to loss. I’m in the states, I’m not sure how much of a difference this makes- The procedure itself took 3 days and they put me out every time. I only remember going in and coming out. Two days were for dilation, I believe it was laminaria that was used. Both procedures were about an hour and a half. The third day was the longest-4 hours total. The staff at the hospital were absolutely amazing for the situation. They also gave me some Ativan to take at home, because I started to have panic attacks through out the whole thing. They said there would be cramping, and bleeding like a heavy period, which is what I experienced. 

No one was ever able to tell me why this happened, or what caused it. So ask any questions you want to. Even if you think they sound stupid, or you don’t know how to get them out. My mother in law came with us to the testing appointments. I think this was beneficial because we were both overwhelmed with emotions and information that nothing made sense. Personally I had a hard time being in the rooms, let alone trying to retain every detail. If you have someone you’re close to, lean on them. My husband has been amazing through the whole thing, but having my best friend check in on me constantly helped tremendously. Especially during this time while there’s so much uncertainty. Allow yourself to cry. I would cry randomly, constantly. Keep so many tissues around you. This was back in August, some days are harder than others, and it comes and goes. 

I also chose to talk to my baby. I acknowledged him, and told him I appreciated the little time we had. This will be hard, but they’ll ask you what you wish to do with the remains. Our hospital had a social worker to help us with this

The hardest time after our loss, was what would have been his due date. I’ve read how some people light a candle, or do something as a remembrance ceremony. Because he was due on Christmas we chose to donate toys to a charity in his memory. It helped me. Don’t be afraid to talk about your pregnancy or your baby if you’re comfortable doing that. That’s been a huge thing that’s helped me after the fact. Lastly, I’m sorry you’re here. This is a heartbreaking experience, that many people go through, but a lot don’t talk about.

My mother in law came with us to the testing appointments. I think this was beneficial because we were both overwhelmed with emotions and information that nothing made sense. Personally I had a hard time being in the rooms, let alone trying to retain every detail. If you have someone you’re close to, lean on them. My husband has been amazing through the whole thing, but having my best friend check in on me constantly helped tremendously. Especially during this time while there’s so much uncertainty. Allow yourself to cry. I would cry randomly, constantly. Keep so many tissues around you. This was back in August, some days are harder than others, and it comes and goes. </p>

<p>I also chose to talk to my baby. I acknowledged him, and told him I appreciated the little time we had. This will be hard, but they’ll ask you what you wish to do with the remains. Our hospital had a social worker to help us with this</p>

<p>The hardest time after our loss, was what would have been his due date. I’ve read how some people light a candle, or do something as a remembrance ceremony. Because he was due on Christmas we chose to donate toys to a charity in his memory. It helped me. Don’t be afraid to talk about your pregnancy or your baby if you’re comfortable doing that. That’s been a huge thing that’s helped me after the fact. Lastly, I’m sorry you’re here. This is a heartbreaking experience, that many people go through, but a lot don’t talk about. Feel free to message me if you need any kind of support. I wish you so much strength and love during this.  💜</p>

I felt so guilty for not enjoying my pregnancy in that time, some moments I tried too, but overall I was terrified and already grieving.

I didn’t have the option to have d&c, I had to give birth.

Remember that it&#39;s only been 10 weeks yet you were pregnant for twice that. And how long did you hope and dream before that? Especially with the questions around ttc just be gentle. I wish you good luck with the tough road ahead.</p>

It’s a terrible thing to go through half of a pregnancy thinking things are fine and then suddenly find out they may not be. 

When my husband and I found out we were pregnant In July of 2019 we were ecstatic. All of our prenatal appointments and ultrasounds, even the anatomy ultrasound at 20 weeks, went great. Out of nowhere, when I was 23+4 I received a call from my Ob’s nurse stating my maternal genetic screen had come back and I was a premutation carrier for fragile X. I had no idea what that meant and delved into google to gain an understanding. Cue the panic and anxiety. Within 24 hours I had an amnio, three days after that we received the news that I was carrying a boy with the full fragile X mutation. The following week, when I was 24+5, I had my D&E. I wish I could credit who wrote this, but during that terrible week when we found out that our baby might have this syndrome until the day I had the procedure, I, like you, reached out to anyone who could empathize with this horrible situation. One woman wrote of her choice to terminate that “sometimes you have to choose life for your child or choose peace. I chose peace.”  This sentiment has brought me a lot of comfort over the past month. 

As for the waiting, it feels eternal. Spend time with your partner and family. Or don’t. Allow yourself to say ‘no’ to doing things if you’re not up for it. Distract yourself with mindless tv. We were told our results for the amnio would take two weeks. After we explained our situation the lab expedited everything and we got the results in three days. 

As for the genetic counselor, I asked mine how many people she’s counseled with this diagnosis have decided to terminate. Her response was “100%”. We also asked about quality of life, lifespan, chance for independence, accuracy of testing. 

My D&E was over the course of two days and was an outpatient procedure. The first day I was under anesthesia and they stopped his heartbeat and inserted the medicine to dilate my cervix. I was told there would be “some pain.”  To be honest it was quite painful. The second day I was under anesthesia again when the D&E was done. I woke up in the recovery room and within an hour was allowed to leave. 

I really hope you receive positive information regarding your baby. If after this terrible wait you don’t, just know there’s so many of us out there who have had similar experiences and you are not alone. It’s a terrible community to have to be a part of, but it is one full of supportive, kind, and and understanding people. 

I will be thinking of you.

Edit:  I didn’t address TTC again. I’m not sure about with labor and delivery, but with the D&E my doctor told me to wait one cycle before trying. As we don’t want to pass down fragile x again, my husband and I have opted for IVF and we’re told to wait at least two cycles. 

Last thoughts...after the procedure you might lactate. This was my first pregnancy and I hadn’t even occurred to me until I overheard my mom asking the nurse about it. Also, it’s been 7 weeks and I still haven’t gotten a period. I’ve asked others in my support group and it seems normal for it to take awhile, so that might affect TTC soon after.",[],,t1_ffpknb1,False,0,[],False,"<div class=""md""><p>I am so sorry for what you are going through.

We TFMR in June. 

My pregnancy was planned and very very wanted. At our anatomy scan I knew immediately something wasn't right because my sons head didn't look right and the US tech barely said 5 words to me the entire scan. 

I had it done on a Friday afternoon and got the call from the doctor himself stating there were some concerning signs for spina bifida. I followed up with him a week later, while I waited to get a call from MFM to see them. 

That was the longest wait of my life. My OB literally brushed my concerns aside. I prodded for information, something concrete, anything. To sum it up, his only comments were that he had just seen a patient in office with her son he delivered with spina bifida who was ""walking and everything."" I refused false hope and tried my best to prepare myself including asking him if termination would be an option if the specialists had bad news. I was told that ""we don't do that here"" and I would need to contact an abort!on clinic in NYC (6 hours away from me in NNY) or call an abort!on clinic in Canada and set that up myself if I ""chose that route."" 

I cannot even begin to tell you how that appointment made me feel. Discussing all of this, about this baby that I loved and wanted so badly, to hear those uncaring words. 

I called the MFM repeatedly, I called them every single day hoping for an earlier appointment. I had to walk around for 2 weeks k owing my baby was probably going to die. Meanwhile we were purchasing a house for this baby and moving and going through with everyday life with our 3 year old, pretending everything was OK with family etc. 

The news we got was horrible. His form of SB was extremely severe and he had all of the terrible codiagnosis to go along with it. I waited 2 fucking weeks, 2 horrible weeks feeling my son moving like crazy, kicking my ribs painfully, his sister getting so excited for him... 

Thankfully the doctor was thorough and told me my OB was WRONG and I would be allowed to terminate and that he would be able to make me very comfortable through it and if that was my choice he would help me. 

I couldn't wait. I scheduled it for the next day. 

I was 21 weeks 5 days and I was induced with a vaginal suppository. I had 3 doses of the meds 3 or 4 hours apart before he was born in the middle of the night alive and kicking. Of course his lungs were not developed so that is how he died. I was able to hold him and see him and kiss him. I was terrified of seeing him. I didn't want to and neither did my partner. We wanted him so, so badly. 

I delivered him on a separate floor from other mothers, it was a high risk l/d floor. The nurses and doctors were absolutely amazing. It was the worst experience of my life losing my son like that, but I thank the gods I don't believe in that the staff was so wonderful. 

I'm still grieving hard. It comes and goes but it's bad. I apologize to him every single day, but I also understand that I am incredibly lucky that I was able to save my son from a life of suffering. 

I'm glad I was able to deliver him and hold him. We have his ashes. I wear some in a necklace and we have an urn box on a desk in my room with his ultrasound photos and footprints. The hospital also had photos taken. They gave me the hat/blanket and cloth diaper he was dressed in. I cherish anything that has anything to do with him. I still have the +frer. I have all of the mail that came in his name (since he was born alive we have insurance cards/birth+death certificate.) 

I don't know what my point it, but I know reading what others went through helped me immensely. So I hope this helps. 

I am always here if you need someone to vent to or talk to or just understand where you are coming from. 

This was an incredibly hard decision for us as it would be for anyone, but also because we wanted him SO Bad and I'm not young, I'm 36,I don't have all the time in the world to heal and try again.

I’m a few days out from terminating a much wanted pregnancy at 21 weeks - we knew things weren’t quite right at the 12 week scan but there was a 50% chance that it was only a physical issue which could be corrected with surgery and they couldn’t tell us more until after the 20 week scan.  It turned out we fell into the wrong 50% and there were severe issues with his heart, lungs, and brain which meant that he likely wouldn’t survive to term and even if he did, would have zero quality of life.  We made the decision to end the pregnancy for the sake of the baby and while it was a horrible decision to have to make, I am absolutely 100% sure it was the right thing to do.

Grieving a pregnancy that you’re still carrying is a very difficult thing to do - just know that whatever you are feeling is normal and natural.  There is no right or wrong thing to feel.  We had ten days between making the decision and termination - I had good days and bad days, good moments and bad moments.  I kept going to work, as being occupied and busy did seem to help me - my team knew what was going on and were all amazingly supportive without being over the top, mostly they left me to get on with it and just kept an eye on me to make sure I was doing OK.  I didn’t want to talk about it with them and they respected that.  Lean on your family, talk and laugh and cry with them and let them support you too.

I would be calling your OB in the morning to see if you can hurry the referrals along (or get your fiancé to do it) - quite honestly the waiting really is the hardest part.  I can’t answer your queries on the waiting period as I’m in Australia; I wasn’t ever offered D&E and did have to labour and deliver, however for me that actually felt like the right thing to do.  They gave me all the good drugs so I felt very little, and I think it helped me feel more at peace with our decision.  I knew that I’d want to hold him and get photos and foot/handprints and I don’t know if that would have been possible with a D&E.  Totally understand if that’s not what is right for you to do though.  We were blessed with amazing midwives who looked after us brilliantly and that helped a lot as well.  The high risk midwife who took us through from the 12 week scan when we were first sent to the high risk clinic was an absolute godsend and when she left just before I left hospital last week, she made a point of saying “don’t delete my number from your phone, if you choose to have another child you get in touch as early as you like and we’ll make sure we look after you again.”  

That does bring me to another point - take all the support you are offered.  We had a hospital social worker assigned to us, and she was great not only with providing support but providing resources for further support if we wanted or needed it.  At first I was a bit sceptical about having a social worker but that was quickly dispelled.  I also second the recommendation for the Ending a Wanted Pregnancy group - it’s an incredibly supportive community.  Just be aware they ask that you have a termination scheduled (or already happened) before applying to join the group, so you will need to wait until you’ve made your decision is all.

I’ve been in your shoes. Not in the exact same circumstances, mind you, but in limbo. Had my anatomy scan at 20+0. Tech couldn’t see his heart or his legs and we got a referral to MFM at the hospital we were planning to deliver at. They weren’t overly worried and the soonest I could get in was 23+?, I don’t quite remember. We were so excited to see him with better ultrasound equipment!

As the tech was measuring his limbs over and over, I was noticing he was measuring closer to 15 and 17 week and his bones weren’t quite straight. When she was going over his head, his skull was changing shape with the pressure of the ultrasound wand. She was so quiet. 

She kept leaving the room and coming back for more scans until finally the MFM doctor came in and did it himself. I will never forget the look on that man’s face as he asked us how we were doing and we smiled and joked about how long we’d been there. He told us that our baby had dwarfism, clubbed feet, bowed long bones, and all of the bones in his body were undercalcified. He suspected Osteogenesis Imperfecta, commonly referred to as brittle bones. I had an amnio performed within the next half hour. 

It took 5 weeks for the results only to learn that yes, it was OI, but they couldn’t tell me what type it was. Ronan’s OI mutation was one the lab hadn’t seen before, but they knew it would be either severe or lethal. We wouldn’t know until he was born if he would live or not. If he did, he would never walk. He would always be in pain and easily break bones. He’d already broken bones in the womb. A later ultrasound revealed his rib cage hadn’t formed correctly, either, but there was still a chance he could live. About a month before he was born, another ultrasound showed his left thigh bone broken in half. I remembered all of the times he’d startled from my knee popping and wondered, had I caused that? 

We still held out hope. His nursery was ready. He had clothes that would make it easier and safer to dress him. Everything had extra cushioning. Almost the entire second half of my pregnancy was spent in limbo. I wouldn’t wish it on my worst enemy. 

Once I got into therapy after his birth and death, I talked about how utterly exhausted I was. The therapist said, “you’ve been stressed out since May and it’s October now. That takes a toll on your body. Of course you are exhausted.”

I've been in a similar place, and the waiting game for more information was brutal. I just want to say that it sounds like you're approaching this situation with strength and mindfulness and grace.

I'm in the States, but I was under general anesthesia for my D&E, which was a great relief to me. My understanding is that some places will do only local anesthesia for the first part of the procedure (dilation), but the major medical center where I had my procedure routinely used general anesthesia for both days of the D&E. This is certainly something you could ask about in advance.

Here are some questions I asked the genetic counselor we saw. (Some of these might be more relevant for you than others... the constellation of abnormalities on my US was relatively rare, I guess, and not easily Google-able so I had no idea what was going on)

* What is the nature of the problem? What is the official name for the diagnosis?
* What caused the issue? Random chance? Environmental exposure? Something genetic?
* What is the prognosis for the pregnancy, and for the baby?
* What do other couples do in the same situation? (Your genetic counselor might or might not answer this, and you might not care; but for some reason I really wanted this information when I was trying to decide to TFMR)
* What is the likelihood that this would happen again with future pregnancies? (Like you, I also plan to TTC again, and so I was anxious to know the answer to this)

Regarding timing: all of the medical providers I saw were very very aware that this was an extremely time-sensitive issue (in my state, there is a 24 wk cutoff), and so they moved heaven and earth to make sure I got information and appointments as quickly as possible. We didn't have the option for additional genetic testing, but all of these timing questions are also very fair fodder for your genetics appointment.

Good luck. Don't be afraid to ask your clinicians for what you need. You're not alone.",[],,t1_ffp49by,False,0,[],False,"<div class=""md""><p>I&#39;m so sorry.

I wasn’t put under general anesthesia, but I know a lot of people were.  Another thing I was terrified of was the amniocentesis, but didn’t hurt any more than an ordinary shot. 

If it will help your peace of mind, you can ask your genetic counselor about infant survival rates with your particular situation, and typical quality of life if that’s applicable.  That was one of the hardest meetings I’ve been through, but the woman I worked with was so kind and compassionate, she was a great help to me.  Even if your diagnosis doesn’t have a definite lethal outcome, a lot of people still choose termination for a more gray diagnosis. It can be so hard to make the decision, but you’ll have to choose what you feel to be best for your family and your baby if that means saving them from a lot of pain. 

The wait between diagnosis and the actual procedure felt so long. Mourning a pregnancy you haven’t even lost yet is a difficult and complicated feeling. I stayed in bed and watched feel good shows on Netflix and slept all day every day, eating all of the junk food. Maybe not the healthiest way to deal with feelings, but it was what I needed.

Just starting to process things sooner would have been better and I think would have eased the transition better.</p>

<p>You will probably be an anxious mess during any subsequent pregnancy, and that&#39;s OK. Seek support and don&#39;t be afraid to lean on others when needed. I&#39;m so sorry this happened to you and for the loss of your sweet Amelia. It&#39;s not fair at all.</p>

Here are my OPKs if anyone feels like helping me discern what the heck is going on. <a href=""https://imgur.com/a/XNrxYE4"">https://imgur.com/a/XNrxYE4</a> I just took another one (I am addicted?) and it&#39;s about the same darkness as CD19 midday yesterday. I posted in <a href=""/r/TFABChartStalkers"">r/TFABChartStalkers</a> but it doesn&#39;t seem like most posts get much feedback there. I&#39;m frustrated, at a loss, and of course  my two best friends and one coworker got pregnant since my loss. Trying not to catastrophize, but it&#39;s so hard.</p>

I keep running to the bathroom to see if AF has come, but nothing. Sigh. And to top it off, I keep feeling so emotional to the smallest things and crying or near crying and I&#39;m sick of it!!</p>

The basic idea is to give my body a few more chances at natural conception before moving on to more invasive treatment. Like you, I ovulate regularly, but my RE is trying to induce super ovulation, hoping to get 2-3 mature follicles per cycle because that increases the chances that I will ovulate a chromosomally normal egg. (My cycles are also a touch long -- 30-31 days -- and my RE thinks my chances will be better with a ""fresh egg,"" though I'm not sure 2-3 days will really make that much of a difference.)

The basic idea is to give my body a few more chances at natural conception before moving on to more invasive treatment. Like you, I ovulate regularly, but my RE is trying to induce super ovulation, hoping to get 2-3 mature follicles per cycle because that increases the chances that I will ovulate a chromosomally normal egg. (My cycles are also a touch long -- 30-31 days -- and my RE thinks my chances will be better with a &quot;fresh egg,&quot; though I&#39;m not sure 2-3 days will really make that much of a difference.)

And if I decide to take the misoprostol, I don&#39;t know when I can take it or how long it will take for everything to pass, or even whether it will work. If I could take the misoprostol on Friday afternoon and be reasonably confident that the worst of it would happen over the weekend then I think I would do that. But if I can&#39;t take it until next week then the gap between being treated with misoprostol and getting the aspiration gets smaller, and it changes the balance somewhat. I think the worst outcome would be to take the misoprostol and for it not to work and have to go for surgical management later than 7th February in the end.</p>

For me, I tried for 5 cycles, which due to my short cycles came to just over 4 months of ""actively trying."" However, total time including my time benched due to my EP was a bit shy of 8 months. My RE saw me right away because he took into account total time, not active time (although I was close since I'm >35).

<p>Ha googling how to sit, I used to google how to sleep, which side, how often I should be going to bathroom, like literally every single tiny detail. My main goal this time around is to reduce stress and anxiety, as much as possible, or at least as much as I can control when my hormones are going insane. 
Good luck, wishing you a quick TTC and all the best ahead!</p>

I look at the list almost every day and try to do one thing that moves my list forward. I try to celebrate the small steps. Hitting a savings goal, etc. Even with TTC, I celebrated when my HCG was FINALLY down to zero again and when I learned how to temp.

I feel like my life has been stuck in mud for months. </p>

<p>So, after reaching my rock bottom, this is what really helped me: On January 1, I made a list of things I want to accomplish in five years and then broke it down into what I can do this year (I used an OKR framework if you’re used to it from business). What I realized is that children is one goal amongst others, and I can focus and make progress on the other ones that also matter.</p>

<p>I look at the list almost every day and try to do one thing that moves my list forward. I try to celebrate the small steps. Hitting a savings goal, etc. Even with TTC, I celebrated when my HCG was FINALLY down to zero again and when I learned how to temp. </p>

<p>For me, making progress on the pieces you can control is a great feeling. Hope it helps you and anyone else. </p>

<p>Sending you positive thoughts.</p>

I came here to post something the same damn thing because I am driving myself insane!! And I definitely can’t tell anyone because I don’t want anyone else to go through the disappointment when my period suddenly shows up. 

Miscarriage in December (took miso). Been waiting on my period, but when I was tracking my BBT I noticed a crazy dip a week after I thought I had ovulated (thur night). When I googled it, of course google told me it was an implantation or ovulation dip. And then my temp shot straight up a full point the next day. So I checked my cervix and it is definitely not getting ready for a period (super high and soft). So... is there any chance I’m pregnant? Or did the miscarriage just mess up my cycles so badly that I’m about to ovulate at week five? Which means I won’t bleed again until week seven which would be upsetting. After my last miscarriage I had a totally normal 28 day cycle so I guess I was just hoping for that. 


I feel like I need to be grounded in reality. This is probably just weird body quirks after a miscarriage. I did take a pregnancy test but it came back negative.

So I don’t want to suggest this is a magic pill, and the scientific jury is still out due to not enough controlled trials, but I do think it can be worth a try if you can get your dr on board. Good luck.</p>

I’m not sure if you know, but Dr. Braverman recently passed away, so if you go with his office, you would be seeing one of his colleagues. We looked into Dr. Braverman at the time we were choosing a doctor, but we did not like how his office makes you schedule a phone conference months in advance and then they determine if you can be their patient after that phone call. And if you pay a large amount of money you can be “fast tracked” and get an earlier appointment. When we called Dr. Kofinas, we were able to get an appointment within a month. 

 We are happy with Dr. Kofinas. His bedside manner is not for everyone. He can be abrupt and he is definitely not “warm and fuzzy.” He tells it like it is. However, he is passionate about what he does and he cares about his patients. The first time we met him, he made me feel like he was going to get to the bottom of what was going on and why we were losing all of our babies. His treatment protocol is aggressive as well, which you can tell by all of the medications I was taking. You do need to stay on top of his office staff with phone calls to make sure they get what you need done. 

We conceived naturally our first two times as well, both of which resulted in the miscarriages. It was at that point my OB/GYN referred us to an RE for RPL testing. (I was 35 at the time and my husband was 38) It was the RE who suggested IVF with PGS, despite the fact that both of my losses came back genetically normal after each D & C. Looking back, I was so desperate for an answer and willing to try anything, that we both jumped on board with IVF. 

We’ve transferred 4 genetically normal embryos- 2 failed, one was my daughter who was stillborn, and last one was the ectopic. After my daughter was stillborn, we went back to trying on our own for 6 months and tried IUI twice, but I was not able to get pregnant again on our own, so we went back to IVF this past summer. 

I never knew ectopic pregnancy could happen in IVF either because I thought they just put the embryo where it needs to go. But apparently there is a small chance it can move after your transfer. I received the methotrexate shot to end the pregnancy and my doctor recommends not doing anything for 3 months, so right now we are on a forced break. We are looking into other tests we may need to have done- sperm DNA fragmentation, laparoscopy, among other things.

It's good to know that you didn't have to go to ER like a few ladies that responded earlier. 

I took 800mg miso pills orally at 1:20pm yesterday and still haven't bled. I also took Tylenol right after I swallowed the pills as I was told it's good to take it right away. I have been stressing about not bleeding all night last night with my husband. Today I called the clinic and the lady I spoke with said that some women don't experience bleeding till later and told me to wait for a week. 

I am curious if the hcg/beta levels have any relationship with how much blood women will get. My beta was 78 on Monday, which was my 8.5weeks and for normal pregnancy that number is very low. I am trying to analyze all the facts but I should just calm down and see what happens in the next week.

The betas (hcg level) was the first think they test for to know if I am pregnant. My numbers were low and didn't double up as they should in normal pregnancy. At first they told me its a chemical pregnancy and that they numbers will decrease naturally.

Ar the ER the doctor said that my beta levels are so low that there is no point to do an ultrasound and he doesn't believe I have ectopic.

<p>Still bleeding a bit, but nothing a panty liner doesn’t stop. I have an ultrasound tomorrow to make sure everything is out, but considering the amount of clots and tissue, I’m hoping I don’t have to do a repeat.</p>

<p>Just wanted to say the experience was not as bad as I expected it to be from reading comments about out before taking it.</p>

<p>Edit to add: my HCG was over 40,000 at Monday’s blood test.</p>

I recently had my 6th loss.

Quick rundown of the losses for background info.

1. ⁠Heart stopped at 10+4, we found out the next day, there was no known reason, D&C, no testing
2. ⁠Heart stopped at 7+4, found out at 10+3, D&C with testing, no abnormalities found
3. ⁠Chemical pregnancy - loss at 4+5
4. ⁠Chemical pregnancy - a loss at 5 weeks
5. ⁠Ectopic pregnancy, took weeks to diagnose and had a D&C to be sure because we couldn't find it...then I took methotrexate
6. ⁠Chemical pregnancy - loss at 5+2

After loss #2, I was getting some general, early testing from my OB but then I quickly had loss #3. I then went to a RE for more testing and help. I had TONS of tests and we never found a ""reason"" that we could pin.

Unfortunately, 75%+ of recurrent loss is unexplained. And testing can be a double-edged sword sometimes.

Clotting and Thyroid issues are the top 2 reasons for recurrent loss. There are tons of tests to check for these. 

I always suggest, at a minimum:

* CD3 testing followed up with surge testing to compare the results (and this should be LH, Estradiol, and FSH...and I’d add AMH) 
* General thyroid testing - and this should be T3, T4, TSH, and T3RU (all of these aren't usually done) 
* Thyroid peroxidase antibody (TPO) test. Many doctors won't do this if the others come back normal, but TPO can still be elevated and cause issues. 
* ⁠Prolactin
* ⁠Factor V Leiden Mutation - for clotting (2nd most common inherited thrombophilia in the US)
* Progesterone testing (cycle day 21 blood test) on multiple cycles. This test is done at 7 Days Post Ovulation (CD21 for the average cycle) to see if you ovulated. You want a level of 10 on an unmedicated cycle. If its lower than that, its harder for implantation to succeed.

To go further than that, I'd suggest

* Karyotyping for both
* Insulin -- being resistant to insulin may increase miscarriage risk
* ⁠Hgb A1c and Estim Ave Glucose (eAG) - blood sugar
* Factor II (Prothrombin) -- clotting 
* Anti-Beta 2 Glycoprotein -- for clotting 
* Anticardiolipin Ab -- for clotting 
* Lupas Anticoagulant Comp -- for clotting 
* Homocysteine  -- for clotting 
* Dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) - Sulfate -- too high can prevent implantation

Some others you might as well test:

* Vitamin D
* Vitamin B12/Folates (anemia)
* ⁠Ferritin  (iron)

For NON-bloodwork testing:

* ⁠Sonohysterogram or Hysterosalpinogram

<li>⁠Ectopic pregnancy, took weeks to diagnose and had a D&amp;C to be sure because we couldn&#39;t find it...then I took methotrexate</li>
<li>⁠Chemical pregnancy - loss at 5+2</li>
</ol>

<p>After loss #2, I was getting some general, early testing from my OB but then I quickly had loss #3. I then went to a RE for more testing and help. I had TONS of tests and we never found a &quot;reason&quot; that we could pin.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, 75%+ of recurrent loss is unexplained. And testing can be a double-edged sword sometimes.</p>

<p>Clotting and Thyroid issues are the top 2 reasons for recurrent loss. There are tons of tests to check for these. </p>

<p>I always suggest, at a minimum:</p>

<ul>
<li>CD3 testing followed up with surge testing to compare the results (and this should be LH, Estradiol, and FSH...and I’d add AMH) </li>
<li>General thyroid testing - and this should be T3, T4, TSH, and T3RU (all of these aren&#39;t usually done) </li>
<li>Thyroid peroxidase antibody (TPO) test. Many doctors won&#39;t do this if the others come back normal, but TPO can still be elevated and cause issues. </li>
<li>⁠Prolactin</li>
<li>⁠Factor V Leiden Mutation - for clotting (2nd most common inherited thrombophilia in the US)</li>
<li>Progesterone testing (cycle day 21 blood test) on multiple cycles. This test is done at 7 Days Post Ovulation (CD21 for the average cycle) to see if you ovulated. You want a level of 10 on an unmedicated cycle. If its lower than that, its harder for implantation to succeed.</li>
</ul>

<p>To go further than that, I&#39;d suggest</p>

<ul>
<li>Karyotyping for both</li>
<li>Insulin -- being resistant to insulin may increase miscarriage risk</li>
<li>⁠Hgb A1c and Estim Ave Glucose (eAG) - blood sugar</li>
<li>Factor II (Prothrombin) -- clotting </li>
<li>Anti-Beta 2 Glycoprotein -- for clotting </li>
<li>Anticardiolipin Ab -- for clotting </li>
<li>Lupas Anticoagulant Comp -- for clotting </li>
<li>Homocysteine  -- for clotting </li>
<li>Dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) - Sulfate -- too high can prevent implantation</li>
</ul>

<p>Some others you might as well test:</p>

<ul>
<li>Vitamin D</li>
<li>Vitamin B12/Folates (anemia)</li>
<li>⁠Ferritin  (iron)</li>
</ul>

<p>For NON-bloodwork testing:</p>

<ul>
<li>⁠Sonohysterogram or Hysterosalpinogram</li>
</ul>

<p>I found during all this that you have to advocate for yourself, so I hope this helps you. Best of luck!!</p>

I told her that I was happy for her but discussing pregnancy related things is going to be hard for me for a while. Over Christmas she told me how tired she was because of being pregnant and she hoped my Christmas was calmer. A couple of days after she said her in laws were trying to convince her to eat something that she didn’t want to eat because it would harm her baby. I told her a second time that hearing pregnancy related things was extremely hard for me. 

Yesterday she asked how my vacation was going (I’m on maternity leave) and another unrelated question. I answered the question but said nothing responding to the vacation part because...it’s nothing like a vacation and it made me feel upset. She got annoyed that I hadn’t answered her about how I was doing and I admitted that I was finding the things she’s been saying to me insensitive so I’m just backing off. Wrong move because she absolutely went off about how she couldn’t be perfect and she was doing everything right even though she is going through such a hard time with stress from work.

(I couldn’t believe I had to point this out to be honest).

Nothing in particular that's set me off I don't think, though some rather poignant song lyrics probably didn't help.

I think my body is being a troll. I had a d&c on 6th December, and another big bleed on the 16th which the hospital thought was me miscarrying the remaining ""missed products"". So I count that as CD1 which makes today CD31.  I had EWCM on CD17 and a near positive opk (1st day testing) which just got lighter over the following days, and I've had no further symptoms of ovulation since then.  If I missed my surge then I should have started my period today (according to my usual 31 day cycles), but if I didn't then it hasn't happened yet. But it's been nearly 6 weeks since the surgery and 4.5 since miscarrying the remainder, so I *should* have ovulated by now?!

In another breath, I don't think I could have ovulated earlier because by HCG was still measuring at 29 on CD18 (down from 48 on CD16), so maybe the near positive opk was just picking up the HCG?  I wasn't temping this month but I've temped for the last 3 days, and it's at the same level it would be on all previous months after I've ovulated.

So it's a clusterfuck and I don't know what the hell is going on. My DH wants me to take another pregnancy test but I'm terrified. I can't see how it's a new pregnancy as we haven't had sex at what I thought would be the right time.

<p>I had a very similar experience, my first fresh transfer took, and at my 7w4d scan the dr said she saw a hb and things looked great. I realized later she didn’t measure anything and I got nervous so I called and asked for another referral, which they assured me everything was perfectly fine and I didn’t need. Got my referral and went at 9w to find a baby measuring 6w4d with no hb. We had waited until the first scan and then told our whole family and a lot of our close friends who knew what we were going through. The day after we told my in laws the baby died, my FIL had a stroke, which I’ll always believe was associated. </p>

<p>It fucking sucks to have medical people dismiss legitimate concerns and then where are they when it’s gone wrong? Do they think about how they gave you the wrong information and advice? Do they even care about it or remember? I tried to file a complaint with the clinic and I was told some drs just don’t measure fetal size and that’s their prerogative.

Reading this brought it all back to me. Pretty much same thing happened to me early December. I woke up, noticed clear fluid running down my legs. I was almost 18 weeks along. I wasn't worried at first, because I felt fine otherwise. I went to ultrasound to just check and they said there was no amniotic fluid left around the baby at all.

We went to hospital where I was treated with antibiotics for two days. The doctors said we should wait and see if the tear in amniotic sac would somehow heal, but realistically told me that the odds are not in our favour. Two days later it was confirmed in another ultrasound that there was no amniotic fluid.

My baby was alive at this point, with steady heartbeat. My labour didn't start, but without water her lungs couldn't develop and while we could have made it for a couple more weeks maybe, she wouldn't have been viable outside. So the doctors adviced me to induce labor, which was the only choice really. 

I gave birth to her next day. The labour and birth were not that horrible in the end, I got very good pain meds and it only lasted for 4-6 hours. I was too scared and shocked to look at her, but the wonderful nurses gave me a little card with her footprints, which I will always cherish. 

In my case, the cause was never found. My cervix was fine and I didn't even have an infection (all tests were negative, the antibiotics were just a precaution). 

I know what you're going through right now and all I can say is that it will get easier with time. You'll always remember her, but it will get better. You're a strong, strong woman and a mother.

I know it's not much of a comfort now, but now that they know the reason for what happened, it can be treated. There's a treatment for incompetent cervix, and in your next pregnancy you will hopefully get all the help you need.

I was peeing at a friends house and when I stood up and I felt a pop like like a knuckle crack, up in my vagina. And a decent amount of fluid gushed out. I immediately drove myself to the er where about 8 hours later I  had my son. I remember being in triage with an ultrasound screen up of my baby saying he was touch and go and a pregnant  nurse telling me not to worry I&#39;ll have my rainbow baby as she&#39;s rubbing her belly. All  before I could even process what was happening. It&#39;s not an easy grieving process, the loss of a child, and I&#39;ll never be the same. It does get easier with time.  Just try to remember nobody is going to say the right thing.  I&#39;m not making excuses for people, but they seem to just go full blown idiot sometimes when trying to mean well, but coming off all wrong. I&#39;m sorry for your loss and I hope my story helps you feel not so alone.</p>

Grief

as for grief, you'll find it comes in waves. When the ship is first wrecked, you're drowning, with wreckage all around you. Everything floating around you reminds you of the beauty and the magnificence of the ship that was, and is no more. And all you can do is float. You find some piece of the wreckage and you hang on for a while. Maybe it's some physical thing. Maybe it's a happy memory or a photograph. Maybe it's a person who is also floating. For a while, all you can do is float. Stay alive.

In the beginning, the waves are 100 feet tall and crash over you without mercy. They come 10 seconds apart and don't even give you time to catch your breath. All you can do is hang on and float. After a while, maybe weeks, maybe months, you'll find the waves are still 100 feet tall, but they come further apart. When they come, they still crash all over you and wipe you out. But in between, you can breathe, you can function. You never know what's going to trigger the grief. It might be a song, a picture, a street intersection, the smell of a cup of coffee. It can be just about anything...and the wave comes crashing. But in between waves, there is life.

Somewhere down the line, and it's different for everybody, you find that the waves are only 80 feet tall. Or 50 feet tall. And while they still come, they come further apart. You can see them coming. An anniversary, a birthday, or Christmas, or landing at O'Hare. You can see it coming, for the most part, and prepare yourself. And when it washes over you, you know that somehow you will, again, come out the other side. Soaking wet, sputtering, still hanging on to some tiny piece of the wreckage, but you'll come out. Take it from an old guy. The waves never stop coming, and somehow you don't really want them to. But you learn that you'll survive them. And other waves will come. And you'll survive them too. If you're lucky, you'll have lots of scars from lots of loves. And lots of shipwrecks.",[],,t1_fec2v38,False,0,[],False,"<div class=""md""><p>I am so so sorry, this is heartbreaking.

All you can do is hang on and float. After a while, maybe weeks, maybe months, you&#39;ll find the waves are still 100 feet tall, but they come further apart. When they come, they still crash all over you and wipe you out. But in between, you can breathe, you can function. You never know what&#39;s going to trigger the grief. It might be a song, a picture, a street intersection, the smell of a cup of coffee. It can be just about anything...and the wave comes crashing. But in between waves, there is life.</p>

<p>Somewhere down the line, and it&#39;s different for everybody, you find that the waves are only 80 feet tall. Or 50 feet tall. And while they still come, they come further apart. You can see them coming. An anniversary, a birthday, or Christmas, or landing at O&#39;Hare. You can see it coming, for the most part, and prepare yourself. And when it washes over you, you know that somehow you will, again, come out the other side. Soaking wet, sputtering, still hanging on to some tiny piece of the wreckage, but you&#39;ll come out. Take it from an old guy. The waves never stop coming, and somehow you don&#39;t really want them to. But you learn that you&#39;ll survive them. And other waves will come. And you&#39;ll survive them too. If you&#39;re lucky, you&#39;ll have lots of scars from lots of loves. And lots of shipwrecks.</p>

I am sorry you had to go through all of that. 
At least you didn't have to take medications and your body naturally went to 0.

I didn't know that Methotrexate requires taking a 3-month break from TTC. That is a quite a long time and I am not sure I want to wait that long. 
Today's beta number increased to 78 from 58 last Wednesday. I am booked to go to a hospital for early pregnancy assessment tomorrow morning. I am not sure what to expect and my husband is taking a day off work (again). I hate to do this to him too but it's probably best we go there together. 

I am really hoping they find out what is going on with me tomorrow and provide me with medication that won't make me wait 3 months to TTC. I googled and I think there are 2 other ones that start with 'M' that don't have the 3 month waiting period, mifepristone and misoprostol. Have you heard of them? I live in Ontario, Canada
I have never heard of the term expectant management, but it sounds similar to what I am doing at the fertility clinic where they check my blood couple times a week to see what the beta is. Right now I think is time for me to go to the hospital as I've read that it's best to take the pill before 9 weeks. 

I hope it goes well tomorrow and will finally get some clarity.

I can empathize  and I have the exact same thoughts. I was supposed to be due next month also (Feb 24). We lost our son at 29 weeks in December. One of the hardest part of grieving and moving forward is accepting things as they are (not how I want them to be). 

It’s painfully difficult to feel positive but you don’t owe it to anyone. I have better days and crappy days. Take it a breath at a time.

I found it healing to connect with other families who have experienced a loss like this and speaking about our son openly and at individual counselling. Thie support of this community has been wonderful too. 

This quote really resonated with me and I hope it finds you well: 

“A mother and father are born when the dream of their baby is conceived.” 

A quote from [this article](https://stillstandingmag.com/2014/07/02/%EF%BB%BFthe-unique-grief-losing-first-born-stillbirth/) about loss of a stillborn and identity of a parent. I struggled thinking if I was a parent because I don’t physically have my baby. But in fact, I do see myself as a mother; my son is simply not with me in the way I had expected.

I had a misprostol induced miscarriage on Sept 16 - I was supposed to be over 9 weeks along, but the baby measured 7 and half weeks. It took me 53 days to get my period after that. After that I had an anovulatory cycle of 28 days. I finally ovulated Dec 29th - 110 days after my miscarriage.

<p>I had a misprostol induced miscarriage on Sept 16 - I was supposed to be over 9 weeks along, but the baby measured 7 and half weeks. It took me 53 days to get my period after that. After that I had an anovulatory cycle of 28 days. I finally ovulated Dec 29th - 110 days after my miscarriage. </p>
