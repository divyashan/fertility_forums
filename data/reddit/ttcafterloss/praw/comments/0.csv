I swear I was haunted by that baby every single day. Once he was born though it was easier. I try to remind myself people get pregnant everyday and ultimately someone somewhere will be having a baby on the same day mine was due. If I was still pregnant I&#39;d want people to be happy for me so I try to remind myself their baby and my baby have nothing to do with each other. It is hard but it helps. </p>

<p>Oh and btw, our next door neighbors are due to have their baby two weeks after our current loss was due. We have joked about how they would be best friends for months. They still don&#39;t know. I get to watch that baby grow up and do all the things my little girl never will. It is heartbreaking. But that baby? Nothing to do with mine. Just crappy timing. :/</p>

First about our diagnosis, then about termination, then about ttc again. Those boards were a huge help and I agree about the conception after TFMR boards. They give me hope, even when it is hard to come by. </p>

Been waking up around five most days, flushed with a racing heart.

<p>I&#39;ve been extremely emotional this week, afraid of not getting pregnant this month and also being pregnant again and facing that first trimester. It&#39;s also been tough getting back into a routine sexually after minimal sex for several months because of bleeding during and after the MC and extreme tenderness when I was still pregnant. Hopefully thing will be easier after we get through this cycle! </p>

I think a major factor in the seeming prevalence of ""accidents"" is selection bias. If someone is super fertile, they might get knocked up the first time they forget a pill or take antibiotics.

If you think you are doing right by your child to let them live with a genetic defect and have a reduced quality of life, go for it.  You are a strong person to take that on.  

I don't want to step on too a high soapbox here or invite judgment upon myself, but I went to Catholic school (high school and then college) for 8 years, and I am far, far, far from a practicing Catholic.  (I was raised sort-of Jewish, but not really anything.)  I got so good at keeping my mouth shut.  The amount of misinformation that came spewing out of my high school teachers' mouths, and my own peers' lack of knowledge or depth of understanding how how gray vs. black-and-white most tough ethical issues are was astounding.  I remember spending my entire senior year on birth control (half for the irregular periods that came back with a vengeance when I started trying to have a child...and half because I had made a well-thought-out decision to lose my virginity to my high school sweetheart of over a year) and having to go to great lengths to hide it.  I remember a day in senior year religion class when one my my classmates started crying for all the aborted babies that happen as a result of women getting IUDs (eye roll).  I remember side-eyeing a dear friend during my college ethics class for admitting that his opinions on abortion and gay rights were colored by his upbringing but that they were too ingrained for him to change his mind.  I value my education, and I learned a lot of valuable things and think I made good choices about the schools I went to.  Personally, I think that being educated in a Catholic environment helped make me more tolerant of people who don't think how I do and gave me a lot of opportunity to question my ethical beliefs and refine them.  That said, I'm not making a sweeping judgment about all people who come from any sort of Catholic/Christian background...but I can't help but be frustrated that so many people's ethical perspective on sexuality, parenthood, and women's bodies is a system handed down by white men who have exactly zero personal experience with these issues.  I was a mom - I am a mom- and I know that  in that absolute worst moment of my whole life, respected and honored my son's life by knowing that I loved him enough to let him go, and I acted selflessly by not holding on to him. If I was playing God on that day, it's because the God I dubiously believe in would never have made my body fail Ethan; God didn't play any part in the horrible tragedy that happened to me, and I was left to make the decisions all myself, as far as I'm concerned.  I know that I made the right decision for me and for my son, and I think you did the same for yours.  

People don't learn to see things with nuance most of the time, and everyone thinks they now what's best for everyone until they themselves have to make a tough ethical decision.  

Anyway, that was way rant-ier than I meant for it to be and I know I'm lucky in that I have never had anyone blame me personally for what happened the night my pregnancy ended.  That said, although our circumstances are different, I maintain that you should never, ever feel ashamed for the choice you made.  Frankly, in my eyes, it wasn't a choice - it was the right thing to do, any anyone who thinks otherwise just doesn't have enough perspective.

(I was raised sort-of Jewish, but not really anything.)  I got so good at keeping my mouth shut.  The amount of misinformation that came spewing out of my high school teachers&#39; mouths, and my own peers&#39; lack of knowledge or depth of understanding how how gray vs. black-and-white most tough ethical issues are was astounding.  I remember spending my entire senior year on birth control (half for the irregular periods that came back with a vengeance when I started trying to have a child...and half because I had made a well-thought-out decision to lose my virginity to my high school sweetheart of over a year) and having to go to great lengths to hide it.  I remember a day in senior year religion class when one my my classmates started crying for all the aborted babies that happen as a result of women getting IUDs (eye roll).  I remember side-eyeing a dear friend during my college ethics class for admitting that his opinions on abortion and gay rights were colored by his upbringing but that they were too ingrained for him to change his mind.  I value my education, and I learned a lot of valuable things and think I made good choices about the schools I went to.  Personally, I think that being educated in a Catholic environment helped make me more tolerant of people who don&#39;t think how I do and gave me a lot of opportunity to question my ethical beliefs and refine them.  That said, I&#39;m not making a sweeping judgment about all people who come from any sort of Catholic/Christian background...but I can&#39;t help but be frustrated that so many people&#39;s ethical perspective on sexuality, parenthood, and women&#39;s bodies is a system handed down by white men who have exactly zero personal experience with these issues.  I was a mom - I am a mom- and I know that  in that absolute worst moment of my whole life, respected and honored my son&#39;s life by knowing that I loved him enough to let him go, and I acted selflessly by not holding on to him. If I was playing God on that day, it&#39;s because the God I dubiously believe in would never have made my body fail Ethan; God didn&#39;t play any part in the horrible tragedy that happened to me, and I was left to make the decisions all myself, as far as I&#39;m concerned.  I know that I made the right decision for me and for my son, and I think you did the same for yours.  </p>

<p>People don&#39;t learn to see things with nuance most of the time, and everyone thinks they now what&#39;s best for everyone until they themselves have to make a tough ethical decision.  </p>

<p>Anyway, that was way rant-ier than I meant for it to be and I know I&#39;m lucky in that I have never had anyone blame me personally for what happened the night my pregnancy ended.  That said, although our circumstances are different, I maintain that you should never, ever feel ashamed for the choice you made.  Frankly, in my eyes, it wasn&#39;t a choice - it was the right thing to do, any anyone who thinks otherwise just doesn&#39;t have enough perspective.  </p>

<p>I took a half pill of my anti-depressants last night... hoping it would help. I don&#39;t want to get stuck on the anti-depressants again because it took a long time to get off of them.</p>

Funny story for you.  I do a lot of hobby board-gaming, and we have a group that meets once a month at a friend's house to game.  I'm quite close with many in this little group, but one guy only knows us all through another monthly meetup we have at a bar.

So this douche definitely ALREADY KNEW.

Stop. Just stop. Also, in my dream during the exam I started my period. So weird. A few nights ago I had a dream that started as well. So that&#39;s a positive right? I must start soon according to my weird dreams? </p>

However, I have also done a TON of research and professional work in the area of grief and loss, as I am a social worker and have worked several years in a hospice setting. 

With that being said, whenever there is a loss the majority of people surrounding it (i.e. those that were not directly affected by it, such as immediate family and friends) may not outwardly grieve the same way you and your husband will simply because the loss did not happen directly to them. This doesn't necessarily mean that they don't grieve the loss themselves or have emotions about it; it simply means that because they were not directly affected by it, they may ""get over it"" sooner. Think of this example ... maybe a husband lost his wife of several years. Everyone will be grieving the loss at the funeral and will allow the husband to do the same, but after a few weeks (hell, sometimes it's even after a few days) people may expect the husband to ""get over it"" and ""move on with his life."" This doesn't mean that those people don't care for the husband, or that they didn't care for the wife who died, it just means that their grief experience was very different from that of the husband. They didn't spend day in and day out with the wife, so the loss is not as significant to them. Does that make any sense? 

Anyway, to make an even longer story shorter, my point is that maybe your friends and family were unsure of how to approach the situation with you knowing that the loss was so fresh and so real to you. Maybe they didn't want to seem insensitive about the fact that they have already grieved the loss because they knew that you are not yet done with it?

I think the best thing you can do is to let them know that you want to talk about it, that it would be helpful if they talked about it as well. So many people who are grieving feel like they can't talk about these things because those around them don't understand their feelings. If it will help you through this journey, I would encourage you to be up front with them about your desire to talk about these things. But it's also important to remember that sometimes these things make people very uncomfortable as well; but again, that doesn't mean they don't care about you or the loss of your baby ... it just means that they aren't really sure what to say or do in order to make you feel better.

I just miscarried 2-3 days ago (in fact I still am, technically speaking), so I really understand your feelings of grief and devastation right now.

Personally, I've had two main types of reaction to the miscarriage (bearing in mind I've only told a very few people). The first has been people like my sister and best friend who have both been falling over themselves to check up on me - calling once or twice a day, sending me flowers and gift hampers, listening to me cry, etc. The second are people like my mother who clearly didn't really know how to handle the news and rapidly changed the subject, maybe assuming it was just too painful for me to talk about.

If I had only dealt with people like my mother, like you I would be feeling very hurt and alienated right now. However I do think both types mean well, it's just that the 'ignorers' don't know how to deal with it and are worried that bringing it up might cause a breakdown or even more pain on your behalf. I think this is especially pronounced for people of a previous generation or who have no real experience of TTCing (and how common and devastating miscarriages can be). They may also be waiting for you to raise the subject first, or be planning to do it in a more private fashion later.

Unfortunately, people can be really clueless when it comes to personal tragedies. It is not uncommon for people to find their friends disappear when they are very ill or have a death in the family, because the friends are so worried about saying something 'wrong' that they don't want to say anything at all. I think the same applies to miscarriages. Probably the best way to handle it is to be honest about your feelings and what you need from them. Not everyone will be up to the challenge, but at least you will have a better idea who to go to (and avoid) next time you need support during a difficult time.

It might be worth it to think about telling your therapist how you feel. That way she can change the way the sessions are structured so that you benefit most from them. If she finds that she is unable to come up with a better counselling plan, you can probably ask her if she knows so,done else who can help you. 

I first started receiving counselling for anxiety when I was a child. I don't remeber why exactly she said this, but she told me that when she sat on her special chair, she didn't feel sad or mad, just helpful. She would say that every time a session started, and it actually became a cue for me to feel really happy and relaxed when I was there. It made therapy a happy childhood memory. Though she totally simplified it for my 9 year old self, I feel like that's what psychologists are thinking once they are doing their job as a counsellor. They trying to help and heal, unless they are shitty at their jobs. If something needs adjusting, let her know so that she can be good at her job and help you :) You can even leave her a voicemail or something ahead of time so that there's a door open when you see her in person.

I hate uncertainty. 

I can't stop thinking about this. I feel like I can't go through this again. I don't want to get attached and love my baby, dream about him/her and lose him/her again. I want so badly to be pregnant again, but I'm so afraid. I want someone to tell me yes, your odds of a healthy, living, full-term baby look great! I don't think anyone is going to tell me that, though. I feel like at this point I shouldn't really be choosy, and I should just set my goals for small successes. Aim for conception, then second trimester, then for viability, then take it from there.

On a positive note, I shared my experience of losing our baby on facebook. It was scary. I didn't really know what to expect. My goal was mainly to just put myself out there in case someone else was scared and lonely too. 

I didn't expect it, but so many people had kind positive things to say. I thought the response would be the silence I got from so many of the people closest to me. Instead I learned that there are other people whom I know, but whom I did not know were bearing their losses and fears alone. 

I think posting about it helped bring us a lot more healing, and though I'm still going into the next pregnancy with fear, I feel like I have a lot more support. I also feel different about sharing it this time round. With James, I didn't tell anyone other than close friends and relatives. Next time, I feel like I want to share with people, even those I'm not close to. I feel like if people can share so genuinely and openly in our sadness, that I can feel okay sharing my fear and my joy with them too. It is complicated, and it might change, but it's how I feel now.

<p>I&#39;ve had some issues with my best friend and after we talked about it, it mostly came down to her knowing nothing about pregnancy, loss, or anything that goes along with it.

I don't have to go to work! It is currently -30 outside w/ windchill. Yikes! Good thing I live directly next to a dunkin donuts. I got my latte and breakfast there. :)

So I don't know if you guys remember me talking about my Maid of Honor and how in the three years since the wedding, we have gotten to the point where I don't trust her or want to talk to her about anything. The last straw was me talking to her about Clomid in June and expressing my worry for the side effects and her telling me that ""lots of women do fertility treatments and survive(it's not like it's life threatening)"". How about totally invalidating ANYTHING I was feeling by making it seem like I'm overreacting because I'm not dying? Fuck that shit.

She came home over Christmas(She, her husband and child she conceived accidentally live in Thailand right now), and us girls all got together at my friends house. It was four of us and their six children. A tough night for me, for sure, but the other two girls knew about my problems getting pregnant and then also my MC. I had not told Marci(MoH) about the pregnancy or the loss after her insensitive comments.

When I hugged everyone good bye, Alison said, ""I am so sorry for all that you've been through the past few months. Know that we love you and are constantly thinking of you and hoping for the absolute best. You deserve only the best.""

Well Marci overheard apparently. She sends me a Facebook message last night just flat out asking ""What happened in November at the end of last year that made it so shitty? I'm half a world away but always available to talk! Love you!""

I FINALLY had my follow-up with the MFM today. It was interesting. Most interesting is that my cervix tore back in Feb last year when I had a fibroid removal followed by a d&c. No one ever told me this. I was very surprised. Though my cervix was stitched then, and looks intact now, there could have been lasting mechanical damage. Unfortunately they can't figure that out until I'm pregnant and something starts to happen. The sad thing is that this doesn't even mean that my CI was caused by this. It's just one more possible cause.

The MFM said that we could start trying right away. I think we definitely will. If my cycle is normal, hopefully I'll be ovulating in roughly two weeks. Initially, I'd planned to just wing it, forget about temping and OPK's and try to put some fun and spontaneity into the process, but I don't feel like that anymore. Fun, spontaneous sex can happen still, but I'm not going to risk missing that egg. I want to be pregnant as soon as possible. 

The MFM noted that the placenta was on the small side, but that it didn't seem to cause any issues. However, she said that I should start taking baby aspirin to help with implantation. Anyone else on aspirin? 

I feel like the door is finally closing on the whole process of this loss. I'm at peace with it. I feel ready to move on, and ready to face the challenges of the next pregnancy as they arise. What a relief. 

I hope you are all doing well.

For some background, my husband and I moved an hour away from our old city 2 years ago. He kept his job and commutes, and I quit mine. I never finished college (huge regret) and I've been working in administrative office jobs ever since. It took me almost a year to find a job here, I finally found one, I worked there for a few months and it was awful. I had been wanting to TTC for about 2 years at that point but my husband didn't feel like we were financially ready. The plan was for me to be a stay at home mom, which is what I've always wanted. Finally, he decided we were financially ready, and I quit my shit job and we started to actively try. I got pregnant 4 months later (February 2014) and then lost it this past August. 

When I lost Oliver, it wasn't just that I lost my baby, but I felt like I lost my sense of purpose. I'd been floating through my life at crap jobs for years, just waiting to get to the point where we could have a baby and I could be a SAHM. When I got pregnant I felt like I was finally where I wanted to be in life and things were finally moving forward. I was so happy. Now that he's gone and we're TTC with no luck so far, I feel like I'm in limbo. I don't have a job (and I don't want to get one, if I'm going to get pregnant), I don't have many friends up here, and I basically sit at home by myself all day. Sometimes I think about going back to school, but then we'd have to move back home and delay TTC for like 2+ years and I can't imagine doing that. Its pointless to delay TTC for years, get a degree, find a job, and then TTC again so I can quit to be a SAHM. If I was younger I'd consider it, but not now. 

But then I think, what if I don't get pregnant or what if I keep having losses? At what point will I say, fuck this, I need to do something else with my life? Will it be a year or two or even longer? I can't imagine being in limbo like this for more than like, another 6-8 months. At that point I think I'd really need to reevaluate things. I hope we don't ever get to that point - but we can't afford fertility treatment if we do. I wish I already had my degree and a decent job that I could distract myself with, but I don't, and with my education and work history I'm only going to get the same boring jobs I hate. 

My husband keeps assuring me that I'll get pregnant soon, and we'll have a baby and I won't have to think about these things anymore. Hopefully he's right. It's just that every time I get a BFN I feel like the chances are diminishing. Like maybe my body can't make healthy babies because of my medical issues and it's trying to tell me that. 

I think I'm depressed. My therapist says she thinks I should try an SSRI again but I'm too scared that it's what caused Oliver's birth defects (I was on Prozac and quit around 6 weeks, which was when his problem developed). I feel like I would have to feel suicidal before I got to a point where I would consider meds. 

I know I shouldn't be banking my future and all my happiness on getting pregnant again, but there's nothing else that matters to me right now.

5w3d: This mc was practically a non-event. I spotted one day, my temp dropped the next day, and on the third day I started bleeding like a normal period. I had no cramping. I used one regular pad a day (washable cotton pads that are a little more durable than regular pads). It lasted 4 days like a regular period (first day heavy, second day medium, third day light, fourth day spotting). 

for comparison, here's my 8w story:

8w6d: It took 2 days of spotting to really get started. During that two days I felt no cramps, but felt a really weird heavy feeling. Like my uterus was leaning forward, slumped over. I called my midwife and she calmly told me that I was likely miscarrying and it'll be like a heavy period. When the real bleeding started, it came unexpected as a *sploooosh* when I stood up. It was like the elevator scene from The Shining. I **panicked**. I went to the ER (which was terrible, uncomfortable, humiliating). The heaviest bleeding took place during the 5 hours I was sitting in a puddle in the ER. The bleeding calmed down after I got home from the ER (using only one large overnight pad a day). For the next few days it was like a normal period with occasional mild cramps. 

If I had stayed home, and not gone to the ER that first MC would have been much less traumatic. 

Things to consider:

Keep temping! If your temp drops, you'll have a warning and can prepare yourself a bit for the day ahead.

They tell you not to worry during mc unless you run a fever over 100 degrees F (a sign of infection) or start bleeding really heavily soaking a large overnight pad within 30 minutes (a sign of hemorrhaging). If these things happen, they tell you to go to the ER.

I assume a doc on the cruise would be able to assist with an infection. I don't know what they do for hemorrhaging (but I think some people on this sub have dealt with that, so you could ask around). 

Infection is a risk because your cervix is open, so to reduce your risk there, use pads. Washable pads are so much more comfortable than those big plastic diapers they sell at the drugstore. I got mine from Party In My Pants, but there are other brands. Comfort can be a big deal. Those plastic pads are sticky and will be a constant reminder every time you stand up or sit down. I can't emphasize this enough. I used normal drugstore pads for the first mc, and I felt disgusting the entire time. Sweaty, sticky, every time I moved the pad would make crinkly noises. It made me so sad, I think most of my crying was over what I felt was sure to become diaper rash. Fuck that shit. Washable cotton pads are the bomb. 

It might be worth peace of mind looking up the stats about whether you are more or less likely to develop one of these two problems depending on how many weeks you are along.

I hope this will be the year of happiness and success after loss for all of us. I really appreciate everyone's support and stories, you all make this a little bit easier to bear. 

Today is a hard day. It's been shitty since Christmas. I try my best to be positive, an optimist, I love being happy and celebrating big and small things, but it's been so fucking hard.

I cried on Christmas Eve, because I was wearing some shitty dress that I didn't like, and not the turquoise maternity one I'd chosen the morning of the day my water broke. I cried because I wasn't a glowing, pregnant woman but a grieving, broken not-quite-mother. 

I cried on Saturday last, because that was my viability date. I was in paradise with turtles and dolphins, and I cried my eyes out because my body failed my family and I couldn't find anything to celebrate on that day that I was so looking forward to. 

I cried tonight at my in-laws New Year's Eve party, because at midnight, my husband's cousin, who is sweet and wonderful and all that, announced her pregnancy. I'm still crying. I tried my best to hold it together, I went into the bathroom and tried to get my eyes to look less red and shiny, but it didn't work. I'm upstairs now feeling like shit. I hope she doesn't feel bad, and I'd like to tell her no hard feelings, but I can't keep it together. I'm supposed to be the one avoiding the cold cuts and booze. Instead I'm drunker than I want to be, crying in bed, feeling some seriously painful self loathing.

My parents live in a different hemisphere, but I called them anyway and cried some more. I don't know what I'd do without them. My husband noticed that I'd disappeared, and he held me for a while, but he had to go back down to his relatives before they wondered where he was. 

I feel sad, broken and empty. I haven't even gotten a period yet, just weird discharge and perma-PMS. I hate my body these days. Why aren't I pregnant anymore? Why isn't it telling me that it is fertile? I think I'm just going to forget the party. My nose and eyes are swollen and I am suddenly really exhausted and just don't care what anyone thinks of my anti-social behaviour.
