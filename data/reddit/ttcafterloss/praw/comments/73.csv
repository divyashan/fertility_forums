My concern was that if the birth control helped shrink them, which would be great, but would they come back once I went off birth control and started ttc. 
I'm just not sure how it all works, because I even read they can still come back once they are removed too. 
My Dr. said that right after having surgery, I will be most fertile because the cysts will be gone and my tubes will be cleared. We're hoping this surgery will give us a better chance of conceiving.
She said the cysts cause inflammation, which increases your white blood cell count that fights off foreign cells, whether they are good or bad. Which means when we try to conceive, the white blood cells are fighting off the sperm. Which is hindering us from conceiving.
My Dr. also said that my pregnancy and miscarriage seemed to cause the cysts too. Because I have no history of cysts or pain. 
I did have more cysts right after my miscarriage, two went away and now I am left with two, one on each ovary. It was painful after my miscarriage, my right side hurt because my ovary had three cysts on it. 
I agree, it is a double whammy. I don't know anyone who got cysts after a miscarriage either. After my miscarriage, I felt like I was just trying to deal the loss and then I found out I had 4 cysts. It scared me. It took 6 weeks, after my miscarriage, for my HCG levels to go to 0. It was a very emotional time. 

Thankfully, I have some answers now and I am okay. Accepting this is my journey, has been a struggle. I thought conceiving would happen sooner for me, I feel bad for taking that for granted. For so many years I tried not to get pregnant and it wasn't until I was 37 that I was ready and now here I am.

It‚Äôs tough. I‚Äôve had a lot of loss, but this one hurt the most. My heart goes out to you. There‚Äôs a lot of waiting, and not fair shit that comes with the territory. I hope you have support and know you can ask for help here. A lot ran through my head, I do recommend seeing a genetics counselor and having testing done. And if you do have any questions about IVF, the infertility sub or ivf sub are both pretty supportive and have a ton of information. I‚Äôm currently starting my second round of ivf meds, but not for a translocation, just for the pregnancy losses and to be able to do PGS testing to hopefully avoid more abnormalities.

I'm so sorry for your loss, but I'm glad you found this community. You'll find lots of good support here. You may also want to check out the FB group Ending a Wanted Pregnancy. They're great there too.

We tx in December at 17w for giant omphalocele and chromosomal abnormalities. The weeks waiting for our chromosomal results and the baby's autopsy were awful. But despite being told by our genetic counselor and the geneticist we had a very high likelihood of one of us having a balanced translocation, neither of us did. It looks like this was just a fluke for us. It was our third pregnancy and third loss. We are just starting to TTC again this cycle (3rd month, 2nd cycle after tx). 

I had very similar thoughts to you in the immediate aftermath -- will we need to do IVF + PGD? Do I even WANT to do this again? Maybe this is a sign we aren't meant to have bio kids? All that. I will tell you as the months go on (I'm now in 4th month post-tx) you start to see clearly again. Those first few weeks you are seriously in a hormone haze. Things will become clearer and you'll return to your sense of what YOU really want. Don't feel pressured to come to a decision right away.

I totally relate to wanting to get your body back, to regain some control over your life again. I started exercising right away, but I will tell you it took almost 3 months for me to lose the weight (I had gained about 6 pounds) and even though I'm below my pre-pregnancy weight now, I still have some extra around my tummy. Hormones are weird.

There are methods used in research labs that could have determined if our son's genetic issue came from my egg or my husband's sperm.  But they aren't used in clinical (hospital) settings, and even though I'm generally a ""more info is better"" type, it's probably for the best that we don't know.  

There are some genetic issues that can manifest very differently from individual to individual.  No one knows why or can predict how things will go.  Environment, genes from the other parent, etc. also probably play a role.   In your case, your husband doesn't have the other issues your baby had.  So there was almost certainly something else at play.  Maybe baby inherited your husband's heart defect gene, but would have had a more treatable CHD, like him, if not for having a *second* mutation somewhere else--the one responsible for the other issues you mentioned.  That's likely not something that can be known, with current genetic methods.  But even if such a scenario could be verified, it wouldn't be your husband's fault, or anyone's fault.  It would be a case of a terrible luck, *de novo* mutation taking a predisposition to CHD's and turning it into HLHS, along with several other problems.  Neither of you should blame yourselves or each other.  

As for recurrence....since our son's issue was identified, both my husband and I had blood tests.  They didn't find it in us, so they think it was a spontaneous (de novo) mutation in either that one sperm or egg.  But they told us that they can't 100% rule out germline mosaicism (where the mutation exists in the ovaries or sperm that produced that sperm or egg, but not throughout the body).  So they put our risk somewhere between 0.1% and 1%.  For any subsequent pregnancies, we should have fetal echos for CHD's and an amnio to rule out recurrence.

The couple in our support group didn't have a mutation identified, so they couldn't have the same type of blood tests.  Their doctors weren't comfortable giving them a recurrence risk estimate.  I imagine the assumption is that most likely their baby had a de novo mutation, too, since their both healthy. But not being sure of the cause, their doctors weren't willing to say that definitively.

As the article says, more than half the adhesions they found were very mild. You can have very minor adhesions and still get pregnant, and since we don't usually check everyone after a D&C and then follow their outcomes, we really don't know how it affects people.

I've dug into the literature quite a bit. There's a risk of adhesions simply by having a miscarriage at all. Certain procedures cause more risk, but there aren't enough studies to fully stratify exactly what's responsible for what percent of the risk. We do know that scraping is worse than vacuuming, and that doing a D&c with ultrasound guidance is better than without, and that using hysteroscopy might be the lowest risk for missed miscarriage/retained products. Having retained placenta is a risk in itself, but doing a d&c for retained placenta is also more likely to result in adhesions than an initial d&c for a missed miscarriage.

That said, yes, many ob/gyns way undersell the risk of adhesions, and it is something that really, anyone who has any sort of miscarriage, should be aware of.

I have some travel for work, and I‚Äôm thankful I won‚Äôt have to pee every 30 minutes on my cross country flight. I have a family vacation coming up and as much as I would have loved to tell my family we were expecting, now I can do more outdoorsy activities that I couldn‚Äôt have done if pregnant.</p>

<p>It‚Äôs also okay to be sad, as much as it sucks. I would also be about 10 weeks along now, and today is the 6th anniversary of my and DH‚Äôs first date, so I had a good cry last night. </p>

<p>Sending you hugs and hope those help a little, too. Someday you‚Äôll get to channel all this emotion into an LO who will be such a lucky rainbow baby.</p>

When I spoke to two OBs that managed my MMC both said that D&C shouldn‚Äôt interfere with subsequent pregnancies. They both are at a large academic hospital, and both are professors in clinical medicine and have publications in both surgical and non-surgical areas. I think some doctors believe that the lining may be thinner, while others don‚Äôt believe that (same with progesterone supplementation in early pregnancy). 

I‚Äôve come to discover that there‚Äôs very little funding money that has been spent on understanding miscarriages and pregnancies, and a lot of this information is just unavailable to us. I would also not put all my trust in one study, even if there is one. In most areas, the data and evidence is complex and one set of researchers will make one conclusion, while others will make a different one. Only repeated, and larger studies can provide conclusive results, and unfortunately when it comes to miscarriages, the data out there is limited even though it happens so often.

This week has been a roller coaster. 

So Friday marks 3 weeks since my second loss. The first one last year was at 19 weeks. This last one was at 17 weeks. 

On Tuesday, I called the funeral home for the third time to check to see if my son‚Äôs ashes were ready for pick up.  The first two times they said that if you haven‚Äôt heard from so-and-so then they aren‚Äôt ready yet. This funeral home provides free cremation for babies in the area so I was trying really hard to be patient. This time they started to say the same thing again but I asked to leave a message for the person who should be calling since it‚Äôs been almost three weeks with no word from her. They put me on hold and then came back and told me the ashes should be ready for pick up tomorrow or the next day. This seems really odd to me, like he was forgotten about. The same funeral home cremated my first son last year and it only took 3 business days for his ashes to be ready. 

On Wednesday, the funeral home called to say that my son‚Äôs ashes were ready. Later that night, I was feeling really down and questioning whether or not we should try to have another baby and thinking I was just being selfish since my body no longer seems to be a safe place for a baby. 

On Thursday, my MFM personally called me to tell me that the DNA microarray results for my son had come back and were normal. We then spent a few minutes talking and I told her about how the OB who delivered my son found that the triple nuchal cord was the cause of death. I then told her about testing that my OB has done and has planned and the MFM said ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs great. She read my mind.‚Äù She was really kind and sensitive the whole time. She said ‚ÄúI really think a lot about my moms like you. I can‚Äôt imagine what you‚Äôve been through. I know you‚Äôll never forget your little one but I hope you and your hubby can take some time for each other and soothe your souls. You have a high chance of having a successful pregnancy next time. My biggest wish is that you‚Äôll have a screaming, crying, pooping baby.‚Äú When we hung up, I just cried happy tears. She was so kind and caring to call personally and her words really helped me feel hopeful for the future. Later that evening, I made plans with my mom for her to watch my LC on Saturday while my husband and I went to pick up the ashes. Then afterwards, we‚Äôd take my mom out to eat for her birthday that‚Äôs coming up in a few days. 

On Friday night, my little sister called to tell me that she‚Äôs 12 weeks pregnant (her first). I was happy for her and managed to tell her congratulations and not cry on the phone. After we hung up though it hit me that she‚Äôs due only 8 weeks after I would have been. It was like a shitty deja vu that just stabbed me in the gut. During my last loss, my SIL was pregnant and due 4 weeks after me. I already have a niece who will always remind of my first son since they‚Äôre the same age. She was born back in August but I was just recently able to be in the same room as her and hold her when she was 6 months old. Now, I‚Äôm going to have another niece or nephew who will always remind me of the second son I lost. And I have to deal with another close family member being pregnant while I‚Äôm grieving. After knowing my sister‚Äôs news, I knew I couldn‚Äôt be around my mom the next day because I‚Äôm sure I‚Äôd have to tell her that I‚Äôm not okay to hear all about my sister‚Äôs pregnancy. I cancelled with her and we found some friends to watch my LC instead. 

On Saturday, we picked up Levi‚Äôs ashes which sucked as expected. When I looked at the cremation certificate, it said his date of cremation was on Wednesday (almost 3 weeks after he was born). It‚Äôs really upsetting to wonder what the hell they did with him all that time if he hadn‚Äôt been cremated yet.

I felt like my choices were to sit at home and be depressed and alone (my husband was off for 1.5 weeks) or go to work and be depressed, but maybe get a little distracted. The other factor is that as a teacher, I still had to write sub plans so I was not really getting to be off work fully and honestly I hate being gone because being there is easier than planning for someone else, my team telling me how terrible the sub is, and worrying about data tracking. Charlotte has taught me that I put too much pressure on myself, but this is what I was worrying about. I wish I told my team I couldn‚Äôt do it and I couldn‚Äôt handle the complaints about the sub because I did feel pressure to return. 

I was not physically ready to go back when I did. After returning to work I went to the ER 3 times did extremely heavy bleeding/hemorrhaging and ended up having a d&c 2 weeks after going back. I had to take more time off or leave in the middle of the day (super inconvenient) and the weeks I was there were a total blur. Five weeks after delivery I think I was a little more with it. 

I asked my principal to share why I was out the first week I was gone. One of my teammates was pregnant after a loss and I hated that she was getting questioned about it. However, people had the chance to process it while I was gone. I also shared on social media days after delivery. Most people are too awkward to say anything. Or feel so uncomfortable or sad that they don‚Äôt know what to say. I have only had a couple of hurtful encounters, but most people have been fine or even good. The world goes on, but this doesn‚Äôt go away or stop hurting. Some people at work still check in, but most are awkward. I used to be that way. Now I get it. Moms want people to know about their babies, living or not. 

All that to say... don‚Äôt let others pressure you to return. Go back when you feel it‚Äôs the right decision for you because of you. Be aware of yourself physically and emotionally. Big hugs.

Many people with this diagnosis go for IVF with PGT. But it depends on the size of your chromosomal breaks and the chances of a live birth of a baby with an unbalanced translocation and what problems that would create. You will need to discuss this with a genetic counsellor.

I read your post and it hit me really hard. Almost five years ago, I lost my 84 day old daughter. She was fucking perfect in every single way and it absolutely gutted me.

Your post hit me so hard because I can actually feel myself, writing the words you wrote, early on. And I am so so sorry that you are feeling this. No one should ever have to. 

Would it have been easier to have just been able to get to the end point and be okay? Of course. But what is easy isnt always what is right. Like I said, there are so many things I wish I could go back and undo... but I cannot. I can, however, say I am alive. 

I am unsure as to why I felt your post so deeply, but I did. If you ever, ever, ever need to talk to someone that is a little further out than you or has done some seriously impulsive things to just feel something other than the pain, I am here. Reach out. 

Enjoy Hawaii. After I burried my sweet sweet little lady, I took a 10 day cruise through the Caribbean. It was probably the only thing I did correctly after she died. It was beautiful and most of all mind-numbingly easy to escape the constant pain.

I am so sorry you‚Äôre here. This is hard shit. This won‚Äôt be easy and I‚Äôm deeply sorry. We are in our mid
 30s and have experienced one early loss this year after 7 years of unprotected sex. 

First things first, you need to speak with a geneticist about your odds and understand what you‚Äôre up against. The odds are often not what you will think they will be. We thought ours would higher, but we have four retrievals under our belt after 80 eggs retrieved and 64 fertilized - we have four genetically screened normal embryos. There can be complicating factors beyond the BT. I sincerely hope that isn‚Äôt an issue for you. Our odds are 1/16 - 1/8 depending on who you talk with. They said 1/16 would be normal and 1/16 would carry the translocation, but we wouldn‚Äôt be able to tell which embryos with cooper genomics; which means we will likely have children who have the BT (and infertility/RPL) as well. Our issue is getting enough quantity to blast for our odds. Our quantity to blast has been lowish considering my stats - 4-8-3-1. Two rounds were compete fails after PGT results. 

Having a BT means unless you are ready to deal with repeat loss, you will need PGT-SR to identify the embryos that are balanced/normal, and it requires IVF.

I am so deeply sorry that you‚Äôre in this spot. It is shocking and destabilizing. Most of the time these BTs are inherited and not spontaneous, which means the parents of the person with the BT likely experienced loss as well. We haven‚Äôt had a great time discussing it with our family, so we‚Äôve kept it to ourselves.

This is so much to digest. I am here if you ever want to talk and discuss what‚Äôs going on. 

Edit: just realized why my flair isn‚Äôt showing up. I‚Äôm not in the infertility sub. I would have responded less with IVF stats and more with my process had I read more carefully, sorry!!!

I am so deeply sorry you‚Äôve gotten these results. It was a huge shock to us and we mourned it heavily.

Please don‚Äôt hesitate to contact me anytime. I‚Äôm active over in the infertility sub.

My job is tedious-- my job is 90% spreadsheets-- hundreds of thousands of rows long and 80+ columns wide. I have to review these things against state and federal laws and regulations and determine if they should be reimbursed, recategorized, or denied. 

The other 10% is meetings, usually with some catty women. These are people who relish in the failure of others. You know that saying, ""Fix another queen's crown without telling everyone it was crooked""? These women will knock your crown sideways and then invite everyone else to point and laugh at how imcompetent you are. 

I took a full week after my most recent loss. I then spent the next month with my office door shut. For that month, I opted out of every meeting I could opt out of, and the ones that I couldn't opt out of, I just scheduled an appointment at the same time so I'd miss it. 

I couldn't face people. I couldn't stand music with lyrics that were too sad. I listened to a lot of Blackmill and M83. I'm pretty sure I listened to Spirit of Life and Outro about 1000 times. Give them a listen if you like that kind of music.

I went to therapy every week for a while. Actually I went on a Friday and then scheduled another appointment for the following Monday because I felt like I needed it. I'm 8 weeks out from the day we found out our baby died. I still feel... impulsive. Maybe that's not the right way to describe it. I just have a really hard time caring about consequences. Like on Wednesday evening, my husband and I both had really shitty days, so I booked a previously unplanned trip to Hawaii-- for this month, which is half-over already. I told myself I would only do it if I could find airfare and lodging for under $2,000. I think I spent $2,600 on airfare and lodging. It's totally last minute. It was expensive. It wasn't something we talked about or agreed on or researched. I was just having a bad day... and it gave me something to do. I didn't enjoy the planning, and it felt like a giant ""well fuck you, I'm going to Hawaii"" to the things that made my day bad. I'll definitely enjoy Hawaii, though. But I'm doing lots of ""impulsive"" things like that. It's almost like redirecting my feelings... but instead of being mature about it, I'm just going with the first thing that pops into my head that will make me feel better. 

That goes for interacting with the catty women from work, too. I'm definitely responding in a way that amuses me, even if it isn't the most professional thing. I've been a smart ass twice, and I usually don't sink to their level:
""Well, tell me how you *really* feel about it.""
""I'm glad that we aren't being bitter and angry... oh, wait. My bad. We are being bitter and angry.""

If you work with nice people who are generally cooperative and supportive, you might not have the same issues as me. Also, I need a new job.

I have also had two losses and then was unable to conceive for six months after my last loss due to weak ovulation/a luteal phase defect. About two months after my first loss, I had my progesterone measured and it was 9.6 at 7DPO, which led me to believe that I was fine. I had a CP three cycles later. After that, as time went on with no success and lots of breakthrough bleeding in the luteal phase, I got fed up paid out of pocket for AGAIN for progesterone testing and yep, low progesterone (4.6 at 7DPO). I was crushed. I felt like I had wasted months putting myself through the stressors of TTC and that the first draw was a fluke. My OB put me on Femara (to boost ovulation I guess, I was so fed up at this point I didn‚Äôt even care what he was giving me, I just wanted something to fix my luteal phase) and I was successful on my first Femara cycle with progesterone supplementation after ovulation. I am currently still supplementing with progesterone and am not experiencing the things I experienced with my first loss.

I have also had two losses and then was unable to conceive for six months after my last loss due to weak ovulation/a luteal phase defect. About two months after my first loss, I had my progesterone measured and it was 9.6 at 7DPO, which led me to believe that I was fine. I had a CP three cycles later. After that, as time went on with no success and lots of breakthrough bleeding in the luteal phase, I got fed up paid out of pocket for AGAIN for progesterone testing and yep, low progesterone (4.6 at 7DPO). I was crushed. I felt like I had wasted months putting myself through the stressors of TTC and that the first draw was a fluke. My OB put me on Femara (to boost ovulation I guess, I was so fed up at this point I didn‚Äôt even care what he was giving me, I just wanted something to fix my luteal phase) and I was successful on my first Femara cycle with progesterone supplementation after ovulation. I am currently still supplementing with progesterone and am not experiencing the things I experienced with my first loss.

May I ask what kind of Dr you are currently seeing? An ObGyn? If you have access to a reproductive endocrinologist (RE) in your area you may wish to get a referral to one of them. That is what my Dr suggested after my 3rd loss.

For a typical starting point they will do some blood work to look for clotting factors and inheritable conditions. From there I believe typical tests include CD3 bloodwork which looks for hormonal abnormalities affecting menstruation and ovulation, as well as ovarian reserve; a saline infused sonohystereogram, which looks for abnormalities in the uterus; or possibly an HSG which looks at the tubes, though I think that is more common for other reproductive issues, I did not have one; a hysteroscopy if any abnormalities are discovered during the SIS or HSG; and/or an endometrial biopsy, typically done right at the end of your cycle.

There may be some I missed, but these are the ones I either had or am familiar with, and my RE indicated they were typical for an RPL workup.

I'm sorry you're going through this. Emotional support is so, so important during pregnancy or miscarriage. Feel free to message me if you want to talk about anything!

&#x200B;

My fiance found my miscarriage and mood swings very difficult to deal with, as well. It got so bad to the point where I told him that I wanted to break up with him - and I meant it. I was ready to leave. However, after he realised how serious I was, he made a turnaround.

&#x200B;

However, I don't think that threatening to break up would be good advice for me to give, especially if you're not ready to pull through with it. 

&#x200B;

Have you tried telling him how distraught you are over it? Have you told him that you need to be held? Sometimes men need things spelt out for them. However, if he's still being so unsupportive despite understanding what you're going through, that's not a good thing.

&#x200B;

My sister gave me advice to go away to clear my head. I think that was extremely good advice. It could also make your husband miss you more and appreciate you when you return. You say you have a child with your husband. Could you leave the child with your husband/a family member? Could you take the child with you on a holiday? Or, if you can't afford a holiday, stay with a family member for a while? 

&#x200B;

Or don't take any of my suggestions and do what makes you feel comfortable at the end of the day. Just please for the love of god, don't forget to love yourself. You're going through something difficult. Go easy on yourself, eat well, pamper yourself.

I had two intense &quot;waves&quot; of passing tissue as well. I will forever be amazed with how roomy my uterus seems to be. It felt like a magic trick. Except instead of pulling a string of napkins from my sleeve it was.. Clots.. and blood.. and mucus.. from my uterus. In my case my body just wouldn&#39;t let go for some reason and I got a scraping.  </p>

<p>Even though I went to the ER to get it done, it wasn&#39;t a time sensitive matter and no panic. I feel better now afterward. I still have bleeding and mucus, but no big clots or cramps. Hope you get to move on from this chapter soon!  </p>

There is SO much information online, and I've found that some people are very vocal about what choice to make - I'm sure you know, but there are a few types of cerclages (a few different styles of preventative stitches and the trans abdominal cerclage) and you have to decide for yourself what is right for you. Go to your OB appointment with an open mind but make sure to advocate for what you are comfortable with.  I, for example, decided the TAC wasn't for me because of how fast I laboured - the chance of uterine rupture was too high for us, so we will be going with what my OB and MFM team suggests

There are some good facebook support groups - Incompetent Cervix Awareness and Abbyloopers.

TW: Current pregnancy

It took us 9 months to be mentally ready to TTC again and then it took 4 cycles to get pregnant. I've 15+3 and I'm so scared, still. I'm being monitored every 2 weeks but now 2 different OB's and a MFM team is pretty sure I have true premature labour, and not IC. I'll be on progesterone and monitoring - and a cerclage will only be placed if I have shortening.

&#x200B;

All of that said - Take your time Mama. I **know** you want to be pregnant again right now. I wanted so desperately to be pregnant again. I felt so empty. But then the grief hit me really hard, for a good 3 months I was in a fog. I couldn't even think of being pregnant. And then I started to feel ready, but my husband wasn't, and we went in a circle like that for a few month.  Then in August I decided I was ready and tried to go off my birth control but had a bunch of panic attacks, which in my mind meant I wasn't ready. The cycle after that was when we finally were both on the same page. And then TTC was so emotionally draining as well.  Your whole journey now is going to be so laced with so many emotions.

Personally, I hate reassurance against slim odds because it feels like platitudes and false hope and it ultimately feels patronizing to me, even if that's not what is intended. But other women want to hear the hope because they feel like they will be devastated by the loss no matter what, and having hope while hope is still possible won't make it worse when it becomes bad news. Truly, I think most people feel both ways, and it just depends on their mood at that exact moment, but there is no way to predict what will be most helpful at that moment.

I think you should avoid building up hope, especially using your own baby as evidence, because that could breed a lot of resentment and sorrow towards your baby if things turn out poorly. By using your baby as an example, you are creating the comparison and she might start asking ""why did her baby live, but mine didn't?"" That's not a fair question, but I think we see that attitude a lot when it comes to loss and its a normal part of grief. If she brings it up, you should acknowledge how lucky and grateful you are, and that you hope for the same for her.

I think the way to support her is to acknowledge and validate whatever she happens to be feeling, so this really means trying to pick up on her mood and following her lead. People sometimes have a reaction to ""argue"" with people's moods (like, if you feel hopeless, they will try to offer you hope in order to change your mind), but that makes the person struggling feel invalidated. So if your friend needs to have an ""all is lost"" weep session, I think it's best to really empathize with the loss and fear that she must be feeling in the moment. If she is feeling more hopeful, try to focus on the more hopeful aspects (like the idea of ""today, you are pregnant""). Definitely try not to make predictions about the future (bad or good), and focus on what she is feeling that moment and what is happening that day.

Personally, I hate reassurance against slim odds because it feels like platitudes and false hope and it ultimately feels patronizing to me, even if that&#39;s not what is intended. But other women want to hear the hope because they feel like they will be devastated by the loss no matter what, and having hope while hope is still possible won&#39;t make it worse when it becomes bad news. Truly, I think most people feel both ways, and it just depends on their mood at that exact moment, but there is no way to predict what will be most helpful at that moment.</p>

<p>I think you should avoid building up hope, especially using your own baby as evidence, because that could breed a lot of resentment and sorrow towards your baby if things turn out poorly. By using your baby as an example, you are creating the comparison and she might start asking &quot;why did her baby live, but mine didn&#39;t?&quot; That&#39;s not a fair question, but I think we see that attitude a lot when it comes to loss and its a normal part of grief. If she brings it up, you should acknowledge how lucky and grateful you are, and that you hope for the same for her.</p>

<p>I think the way to support her is to acknowledge and validate whatever she happens to be feeling, so this really means trying to pick up on her mood and following her lead. People sometimes have a reaction to &quot;argue&quot; with people&#39;s moods (like, if you feel hopeless, they will try to offer you hope in order to change your mind), but that makes the person struggling feel invalidated. So if your friend needs to have an &quot;all is lost&quot; weep session, I think it&#39;s best to really empathize with the loss and fear that she must be feeling in the moment. If she is feeling more hopeful, try to focus on the more hopeful aspects (like the idea of &quot;today, you are pregnant&quot;). Definitely try not to make predictions about the future (bad or good), and focus on what she is feeling that moment and what is happening that day.</p>

<p>Other than that, the hardest thing for me about miscarriage limbo is the agonizing wait and then unknown. You just have to sit there, helpless, until someone says &quot;it&#39;s definitely done&quot; or &quot;things look better.&quot; I find it very difficult to focus on other things and having distractions is a deeply welcome relief.

My doctor was explaining to me about how the standard used to be 6 months, which just seems shockingly long. But that a lot of the research into it now suggests that there‚Äôs no real reason to wait. He even mentioned a few studies had seen a slight increase in successful pregnancies if you get pregnant again sooner after a miscarriage than waiting until 6 months after to start trying again. Obviously that didn‚Äôt apply to me this time, but, still. </p>

My doctor hugged me after she had another doctor confirm the absence of a heartbeat. It was Friday and the end of the day, and she told me I could get the pills to start a miscarriage. I told her I wanted a D&C with karyotyping (a test to determine if the baby was genetically normal). She said that it's standard practice to make people wait a couple days before offering a D&C, and I remember so clearly looking up and locking eyes with her. I managed not to sniffle, and no fresh tears ran down my face as I said, ""I would like a D&C. I will not endure another miscarriage at home."" She sighed a big sigh, called her boss, and told me that the earliest they could get into my hospital was the following Wednesday-- 5 days of waiting. Fortunately, my body kept carrying my pregnancy, and I went in on Wednesday morning for my D&C.

They asked me what was most important. I told them that I did not want to be separated from my husband, that I felt lost without him, that I needed him there because he brought me comfort. They promised to let him stay as long as they could, but that we would be separated before we got to the OR. Right as we were saying goodbye, a lullaby started playing on the speaker system throughout the entire hospital. Someone had just had a baby. I lost it then. Saying good bye to my husband, and hearing that god awful song as if there wasn't enough of a feeling of loss in my day... I was just devastated. I almost cancelled the D&C.

The whole 5 days of waiting, I was torn between two minds-- one side wanted the expedient removal of the dead baby inside me, while the other wanted to hang onto the pregnancy that was already lost for as long as possible. Get it out of me, but please don't take it from me. It was inexplicably confusing to feel both ways at the same time, and to feel both feelings to the core of my being.

The anesthesiologist put her head close to mine, and even though I had already requested not to have anything extra for the anxiety because of the nausea, she offered once again to give me a little something to help calm me. I consented because I knew that I wanted the D&C and that I was only having second thoughts about it because of the fucking song on the loud speaker. Within 2 minutes, the tears stopped, and maybe another 3 minutes later, I felt stoic. I didn't feel relaxed or apathetic or disjointed. I just felt like a person facing a tragedy alone. I stared at the intricate pattern of the many lights in the operating overhead. I considered that it would be turned on soon and turned toward my vagina, and it would be the first light to ever shine on my baby. 

I did not go under right away on the anesthesia.  The doctor was scrubbed and ready to go, and she told me, ""ICUSSR, I need you to go to sleep before I can get started. We are waiting on you."" In my mind, I said good bye to our baby, and I let myself drift to sleep.

When I woke up, my husband was not there, and I have never felt so alone or so abandoned in my life. I had told them how important it was not to be separated from him, and they let me wake up missing not only my very wanted pregnancy but even my husband was gone. I told the nurse, ""I need my husband right now."" The nurse told me that I would be falling back to sleep for at least another hour and that by the time they fetched him, I'd be back asleep anyway. I began to cry, not exactly a wail, but more than sobbing. I felt near to hyperventilating. She told me that my blood pressure was spiking and she needed me to calm down. I glared at her, and she yelled out the door, ""Get her husband in here now."" It was maybe 2 minutes until he came clomping down the hallway, and I recognized the gait of his footsteps, even if it was rushed. Once he was there, I only remember holding his hand and looking into his eyes. I saw sadness and tenderness there, and I felt calm. They told him that I had not been out of the OR for 10 minutes yet, and that I shouldn't be awake yet. 

I have no memory for what happened then. I don't remember consenting to them giving me Dilaudid for pain I don't remember feeling, but my husband said I did. I don't remember moving rooms or getting dressed. I don't remember being left alone while my husband fetched the truck. I don't remember getting wheeled to the truck or driving home. I don't remember getting home or what we did. I remember nothing from roughly 11 AM until almost 4 PM. 

I ended up back in the ER at 6 PM for tingling all through my legs and arms. It was very painful. It felt like that pins and needles feeling you get, but it felt like I had zip ties cutting off my circulation. They did some bloodwork, and then the ER doc came in. She sat down at my eye level, and she said, ""You've had a very hard day. Go home and rest. I think you'll feel better tomorrow."" 

And the next morning, when I woke up, the tingling was gone, but I did not feel better. I do not feel better today, 7 weeks and 2 days since. There is still a loneliness that I have trouble explaining.

We found out from the karyotyping results that our baby was a girl. My husband who was raised with 4 little sisters, and married me, and adopted two female dogs, was going to have yet another woman in his life. I had hoped our baby would be a boy so he would have someone in his life to share guy things with, but he said all along that he knows his lot in life is to be surrounded by women. For some reason, it made me laugh that he was right all along. That laughter felt every bit as deep as the grief that I still feel. It just goes straight to the heart of me, and it makes me smile even as I write this.

I do not know if any of these resonates with you. I don't know if reading my story makes you feel less alone in your journey. I have not shared these feelings or thoughts with anyone in my day-to-day life. This was our fourth miscarriage, and I don't think I shared anything like this with the first three. I hope this makes you feel less alone. <3

For the record, other women at my work have told me about their miscarriages, but I have never told anyone about mine. Two women told me they tried and were never able to have children. I have not let so much as a hint drop that we have had any losses. Just because no one has said anything doesn't mean no one understands.

She said that it&#39;s standard practice to make people wait a couple days before offering a D&amp;C, and I remember so clearly looking up and locking eyes with her. I managed not to sniffle, and no fresh tears ran down my face as I said, &quot;I would like a D&amp;C. I will not endure another miscarriage at home.&quot; She sighed a big sigh, called her boss, and told me that the earliest they could get into my hospital was the following Wednesday-- 5 days of waiting.

I'm so sorry for your loss. I'm not a medical professional, but I can tell you my own personal anecdotal experience. I lost twins at 16 weeks (MMC, had to have a D&E, so very similar to a term!nation in the physical sense). My doctor told me there was no reason at all to wait any longer than I wanted to, and that there is some evidence that you're actually slightly less likely to miscarry a baby that is conceived within six months of a loss. I don't know source for that information; it's just what my OB said. I chose to wait for my first period, which took eight weeks, and started TTC on the next cycle. I got pregnant with my rainbow a little less than four months after my loss, and he's 14 months old now and the picture of health. As far as I know, there's no medical reason why you should need to wait any longer than you want to. That being said, the question of support is a major factor. If you are worried about lack of support for your next pregnancy, then it might make sense to wait a little while. In my case, I couldn't bear the thought of waiting; I *needed* to be pregnant again as soon as possible. Some people feel like they need to wait in order to process and grieve.

<p>Until I&#39;m pregnant, I can&#39;t even imagine how I&#39;ll ever be properly happy again? But as I said, the vision of me having another baby feels like it is slipping through my fingers and there&#39;s not much I can do to save it. </p>

<p>Fingers crossed, we will both get our positives very soon. ‚ù§Ô∏è</p>

Thanks for the tip about insurance, I'll give it a try. I think hubby is gna try to come with me but the problem is we're both FT and our schedules vary. Hopefully he can. We're on the same page about everything so hopefully no disagreements but I think talk is cheap and once we get there is a diff story. I've heard that if you're gna have any fertility issues, PCOS is a good one to have because there are multiple solutions, so I'm hoping that's true IF PCOS is the reason I'm here. Part of me is secretly hoping that I'll conceive by the time anything needs to be tested.

<p>It really is a crapshoot. I yearn for the days when I used to have &quot;pregnancy scares.&quot; I&#39;m 25 and healthy and I wish I could go back in time and slap myself. If I knew how hard it was gonna be ... Hindsight is always 20/20 I guess.</p>

<p>Thanks for the tip about insurance, I&#39;ll give it a try. I think hubby is gna try to come with me but the problem is we&#39;re both FT and our schedules vary. Hopefully he can. We&#39;re on the same page about everything so hopefully no disagreements but I think talk is cheap and once we get there is a diff story. I&#39;ve heard that if you&#39;re gna have any fertility issues, PCOS is a good one to have because there are multiple solutions, so I&#39;m hoping that&#39;s true IF PCOS is the reason I&#39;m here. Part of me is secretly hoping that I&#39;ll conceive by the time anything needs to be tested.</p>

They asked about everything-- from physical health to the kind of relationship I have with my husband, my family, and even my boss. 

Then, I did a bunch of blood work the next morning-- full thyroid (most places only do a partial thyroid panel), A1C, and just normal blood work type stuff. Then, I started taking synthroid because one of the thyroid hormones was almost completely absent. On Day 3 of my next cycle, I got more blood work done to test fertility-related hormones-- like estrogen and progesterone. I waited until the second cycle to get my HSG done. On the fourth cycle, I had a sonohistogram (I joked to my friend that it was the threesome I never imagined! One doctor filling up my uterus with saline while a second moved her ultrasound wand around inside me).

The doctor told us when to have sex every cycle. When I became pregnant, but didn't stay that way, or just didn't get pregnant at all, she started adding things:

Clomid (one cycle and I nixxed that-- it was unbearably difficult to endure the side effects for me)


Letrozole (maybe 30 cycles? I stopped counting, and I had severe side effects, but endured them)


HCG Triggers (even though I ovulated on my own, they wanted to tell us when to have sex down to the hour)

And when I got pregnant easily enough and still couldn't keep a pregnancy, we started doing IUI to make sure that the sperm that made our babies were as high quality as they could be. At this point, it had been years, and my AMH tanked... and even though I still made plenty of follicles, I just wasn't getting pregnant with IUI. We did sperm analysis four times. We both got genetic tests, and then we got even more genetic tests. We did a disease screen and a karyotyping. We did more blood work as part of a ""Repeated Loss Panel"" and then we did more tests.

In the end, my doctor (now on my second doctor at this point because the first one retired) said that she couldn't explain why we weren't getting pregnant. She said everything was perfect-- that I could not be more tuned to get and be pregnant.

So then to IVF where I decided to forego the attempt at getting eggs out of me and just do frozen embryo transfer with donated embryos (often called embryo adoption). Again, I got pregnant on the first try, and the baby died at 9 weeks. I had a D&C at 11 weeks because my body showed no signs of being unable to support and carry the pregnancy. The genetic tests on our baby came back perfect, and we learned that it was a girl. 

So, I'm almost 7 weeks out from my D&C, I still haven't had a period, and my IVF doctor wants us to wait 3 entire cycles before we do another transfer. We stopped using birth control in 2012-- we are coming up on our seventh anniversary of TTC#1.

I am in regular therapy for my losses. My coping mechanisms have gotten a lot better, and I must admit that I cope better with the later losses than I did with the earlier losses. It's not easier-- I'm just better at managing my grief in ways that are less awkward for the people around me. 

My insurance didn't cover any kind of fertility testing, but my doctors coded tests for irregular periods and things like that. A lot of my medications were covered by my specialty pharmacy which is completely different than my normal pharmacy. All of my IVF meds and most of my normal medicated cycles were covered. Because of my specialty pharmacy, I actually paid less for the IVF meds than I do for my Synthroid. 

My insurance also didn't cover a lot of the monitoring, but my husband's insurance picked up all my follicle studies at 100%. A follicle study is just where they count how many follicles you have on your ovaries to make sure you are going to have something to ovulate. My insurance covered acupuncture, so I did acupuncture for fertility, too. It hasn't helped me get or stay pregnant as far as I can tell, but it has done so much for the period pain and cramps. After acupuncture, I stopped having cramps almost entirely and before acupuncture, I would frequently need to be off work for the pain and cramping on the first day of my period. 

Start keeping your receipts for every medical appointment. Even being double covered, our costs have easily exceeded 7.5% of our AGI every year, which means we can include the costs as deductions to our taxable income. We spent over $20,000 in 2017 and 2018 (each). For 2019, we expect to either do IVF once more and have a baby from it, or do IVF two more times and hopefully have a baby that way. After that, we are out of donor embryos, out of money, out of assets to liquidate, out of resources, out of options, and unfortunately, out of hope. Unless, of course, I quit my job, cash out my (meager) retirement, and then we have options and hope without having any kind of retirement savings.

Infertility, even when it's unexplained, can make you mine your life for every bit of resource it can provide.  In the end, you still might not have a baby to take home. I have, at every turn, been certain that I would never ""take the next step."" In my hubris, I was certain that I didn't want a baby if we had to resort to medical intervention. I wanted it to magical and spontaneous. Then, I was okay with medications, but certain that IUI would never go-- I didn't want a baby like that either. Then, IUI was agreeable, but we could never afford IVF. We'd have to give up so much of what we worked hard for. What's the good in having a kid if we can't share the things we love with the kid? Well, we funded IVF through the sale of every. single. thing. If we owned it, it went for sale. Fancy musical instruments? Gone for a pittance, and my house is no longer filled with the sounds of guitars and saxophones and terrible singing-- just the terrible singing remains. I wanted the sounds of guitars and saxophones for our child, but I wanted a child for us more. We sold our place in the mountains where we spent our weekends. A place I envisioned our child learning about the magic of the forest, the mountains, the stars, and the aurora. 

And now, I have learned my lesson. It would be foolish and unwise to quit my job and cash out my retirement, but I won't say I won't do it. I might do it, because at this point, I feel like a child is worth any cost that isn't morally reprehensible. So I will cut a hard line at child trafficking, but I can't say I will cut a hard line at raiding my retirement. 

If you're still reading, I suggest therapy-- not because you're weak or can't hack difficult days, but because TTC involves a lot of complicated feelings that don't fit nicely into movies or books to help us cope. And therapists are trained to help us navigate complicated feelings. 

I also suggest having a conversation with your spouse about when and how you decide to stop TTC. Our ""point to stop"" has been a moving target. The suggestion that maybe we could or would ""take the next step"" has been momentous every time it's happened, and honestly, I wish we had just done IVF from the start 7 years ago. If we had, and if we had gotten and stayed pregnant for the requisite 40 weeks, we might have had a take home baby... that might have grown into a first grader by now.

<p>I am in regular therapy for my losses. My coping mechanisms have gotten a lot better, and I must admit that I cope better with the later losses than I did with the earlier losses. It&#39;s not easier-- I&#39;m just better at managing my grief in ways that are less awkward for the people around me. </p>

<p>My insurance didn&#39;t cover any kind of fertility testing, but my doctors coded tests for irregular periods and things like that. A lot of my medications were covered by my specialty pharmacy which is completely different than my normal pharmacy. All of my IVF meds and most of my normal medicated cycles were covered. Because of my specialty pharmacy, I actually paid less for the IVF meds than I do for my Synthroid. </p>

<p>My insurance also didn&#39;t cover a lot of the monitoring, but my husband&#39;s insurance picked up all my follicle studies at 100%. A follicle study is just where they count how many follicles you have on your ovaries to make sure you are going to have something to ovulate. My insurance covered acupuncture, so I did acupuncture for fertility, too. It hasn&#39;t helped me get or stay pregnant as far as I can tell, but it has done so much for the period pain and cramps. After acupuncture, I stopped having cramps almost entirely and before acupuncture, I would frequently need to be off work for the pain and cramping on the first day of my period. </p>

<p>Start keeping your receipts for every medical appointment. Even being double covered, our costs have easily exceeded 7.5% of our AGI every year, which means we can include the costs as deductions to our taxable income. We spent over $20,000 in 2017 and 2018 (each). For 2019, we expect to either do IVF once more and have a baby from it, or do IVF two more times and hopefully have a baby that way. After that, we are out of donor embryos, out of money, out of assets to liquidate, out of resources, out of options, and unfortunately, out of hope. Unless, of course, I quit my job, cash out my (meager) retirement, and then we have options and hope without having any kind of retirement savings.</p>

<p>Infertility, even when it&#39;s unexplained, can make you mine your life for every bit of resource it can provide.  In the end, you still might not have a baby to take home. I have, at every turn, been certain that I would never &quot;take the next step.&quot; In my hubris, I was certain that I didn&#39;t want a baby if we had to resort to medical intervention. I wanted it to magical and spontaneous. Then, I was okay with medications, but certain that IUI would never go-- I didn&#39;t want a baby like that either. Then, IUI was agreeable, but we could never afford IVF. We&#39;d have to give up so much of what we worked hard for. What&#39;s the good in having a kid if we can&#39;t share the things we love with the kid? Well, we funded IVF through the sale of every. single. thing. If we owned it, it went for sale. Fancy musical instruments? Gone for a pittance, and my house is no longer filled with the sounds of guitars and saxophones and terrible singing-- just the terrible singing remains. I wanted the sounds of guitars and saxophones for our child, but I wanted a child for us more. We sold our place in the mountains where we spent our weekends. A place I envisioned our child learning about the magic of the forest, the mountains, the stars, and the aurora. </p>

<p>And now, I have learned my lesson. It would be foolish and unwise to quit my job and cash out my retirement, but I won&#39;t say I won&#39;t do it. I might do it, because at this point, I feel like a child is worth any cost that isn&#39;t morally reprehensible. So I will cut a hard line at child trafficking, but I can&#39;t say I will cut a hard line at raiding my retirement. </p>

<p>If you&#39;re still reading, I suggest therapy-- not because you&#39;re weak or can&#39;t hack difficult days, but because TTC involves a lot of complicated feelings that don&#39;t fit nicely into movies or books to help us cope. And therapists are trained to help us navigate complicated feelings. </p>

<p>I also suggest having a conversation with your spouse about when and how you decide to stop TTC. Our &quot;point to stop&quot; has been a moving target. The suggestion that maybe we could or would &quot;take the next step&quot; has been momentous every time it&#39;s happened, and honestly, I wish we had just done IVF from the start 7 years ago. If we had, and if we had gotten and stayed pregnant for the requisite 40 weeks, we might have had a take home baby... that might have grown into a first grader by now. </p>

Even the gynaecologist said that she can only confirm a healthy baby as it&#39;s being scanned. Anything could happen in the minutes, days, weeks afterwards. At the time it was reassuring, but thinking about it now...</p>

I didn‚Äôt realize it was going to take 3 months just for the HCG levels to go down for me, so that pushed my waiting back significantly. </p>

<p>My Dr allowed us to wait for 3 months of surveillance before we can try again. Because of my history of recurrent pregnancy loss, we decided to go straight to IVF with PGS. My Dr is letting us do the egg retrieval in the last month of my 3 month wait, and we will do the embryo transfer after the surveillance is over, so that speeds things along and may be an option if you wanted to talk to your dr about it. </p>

<p>Good luck with everything, molar pregnancies are so terrible, because they are rare and also have this cancer scare that most other women dont have to go through. If you ever want to talk, I would be happy to. I was absolutely devastated after my molar, but I am in a much better place now. I wish you lots of luck and happiness. </p>

I‚Äôm so so sorry you‚Äôre going through this, and I‚Äôm sorry for your loss. 

I had a complete molar pregnancy in 2013, it was my first pregnancy. It was quite the insane emotional roller coaster to be on. Going from not knowing I was pregnant, to ending up in the ER and finding out I was pregnant, then finding out it was a molar pregnancy and possibly cancer. In my situation, unfortunately, that‚Äôs the road it took. I was on intensive chemotherapy for 5 months, and almost ended up with a hysterectomy.

Because of needing chemo, and for the length of time it took for my HCG to reach negative, I wasn‚Äôt able to ttc again until 1.5 years after I was initially diagnosed. I had to wait 1 year after I finished chemo. 

Depending on the type of molar pregnancy you‚Äôve had (partial or complete), how quickly your HCG drops, and whether or not you need chemo, the recommended wait time to ttc is in the range of minimum 3 months after HCG reaches negative, to maximum of 1 year after finishing chemo. 

Getting through the long wait can be excruciating, and feel like forever. In my case, I had 6 months of being treated, with multiple appointments a week. That certainly made that time pass. Then once I was done treatment and into my 1 year wait, I focused on getting my body healthy again and getting ready to start the ttc process again as soon as we were allowed. I had to rebuild my strength, as well as my health. I exercised, ate healthy, and started taking prenatal and other vitamins to get my body ready. Once I started feeling physically better, about 6 months into the 1 year wait, we had a bit of a slip up and I ended up pregnant. Unfortunately that pregnancy ended in an early miscarriage, but was incomplete, so my HCG started to go back up. This of course threw me through the whole thing again, as my doctors were afraid my molar cells were regrowing. I went through countless ultrasounds, a CT scan, and finally a D&C and laparoscopy. It was not a fun time. So that scare itself was enough to make us take the wait time much more seriously, and we pushed through the remaining months. 

Somehow the time passes, even though it feels like it will be an eternity. I suggest once your HCG reaches zero, to take the remaining time to do everything you can to get ready to try again. I don‚Äôt recommend birth control pills, your doctors will probably try to force them on you, but you want your cycles to regulate themselves, and cycle through at least 3 ovulation cycles before you try again.

You will find a wealth of information, and the support that you need while going through this.

Last week, my HCG levels were 3833 and 48 hours later, it was 4271. There was a rise, but not much. The NP ruled out an intrauterine pregnancy and told me that I will miscarry. 

Spoiler alert: She‚Äôs still telling me I‚Äôll miscarry...there‚Äôs no positive spin to this story as yet, except a twist, like Nancy_Wheeler‚Äôs story over here. 

I begged for a progesterone test and NP told me it doesn‚Äôt matter but kind of allowed one - like making me a concession when I just caved in saying I need it for my own mental sanity and get some answers, if nothing else. 

Sure enough, the progesterone has dropped to 10.8, from an earlier solid 38.2 at 5 weeks. NP would still not give me any progesterone suppository. And of course told me it‚Äôs a non viable pregnancy. 

As any pregnant human who had gone through a previous loss would understand, I have been a nervous wreck, and a mess of emotions. 

Yesterday, there was another ultrasound arranged with the same Nurse Practitioner. She still couldn‚Äôt find anything on my uterus and said she saw something on my Fallopian tubes. And then ordered a formal ultrasound for me thinking where the fetus could be on my tubes. She also ordered a bhcg. I just completed 8 weeks yesterday. I kept thinking I‚Äôll probably lose my tubes if the baby, so far along is still in my tubes. In between, I had no spotting or cramping. NP kept telling me ‚ÄúTake Advil when you start cramping‚Äù. 

In the formal ultrasound (done both abdominal and transvaginal), a sac was found in my uterus. Where? The NP wouldn‚Äôt say. 

She just said that a probable fetal pole without a yolk sac and fetal heart tones was found and that exam was limited by ‚Äúmultiple fibroids and patient body habitus‚Äù (I know what‚Äôs Pierre Bourdieu‚Äôs habitus is, not this one...and she didn‚Äôt bother explaining) She said that bhcg has dropped further to 3264. She told me that the fetus is measuring one and a half week behind, and since they know the date of my IUI, they supposedly know when I conceived. That all of this is very indicative of how impending the miscarriage is. PLUS, on top of this, I also have a cyst on my right ovary that developed just in this pregnancy, measuring 3.2 cms. 

When I told her that as per American Pregnancy Association, a drop in bhcg is normal from week 8-12, she wouldn‚Äôt listen. She wouldn‚Äôt allow me an ultrasound next week unless there‚Äôs a rise in bhcg.

Looks like she wouldn‚Äôt rest easy unless she gets reports of me miscarrying...telling her colleagues ‚ÄúDidn‚Äôt I say so...?‚Äù

I‚Äôm going crazy thinking whether all the mental stress , and not eating properly or not being hydrated did actually harm my baby and led to the drop in bhcg. Whether I‚Äôm living in denial....ignoring all the red flags. But what is still in my uterus was ruled out by an incompetent and insensitive Nurse Practitioner. I don‚Äôt want to lose faith anymore. At the same time I wish I didn‚Äôt have to spend my days thinking when would be the miscarriage....

Last time, it was during our off season so it was easy to take time off work. Now I need to find extra help to replace me (I‚Äôm the business owner, but have a lot of involvement with the day-to-day ops). I‚Äôm stressed about still making sure this doesn‚Äôt disrupt my income, but also salvage my mental health and give myself a break. </p>

My first loss was bad, but I just thought it was kind of to be expected. It was at 11 weeks, and I lost everything in the bath tub and let it all go down the drain. I feel a lot of guilt for that, now that I understand what happened. At the time, I just thought it was going to be like a period, but it was very different. The second loss almost killed me. I was devastated and depressed-- not like ""take some meds, depressed"" but like in that moment in movies where someone drops to their knees right as someone they love dies and screams at the sky-- just overwhelmed with grief. My samoyed puppy (google them if you don't know what they are) could not make me smile, and I didn't smile for months because there was nothing to smile about. It was hard to even feel like I had a good marriage or job or home or life. The third loss was not as bad as the second, and the fourth loss was... well, in the grand scheme of things, I'm surprising everyone with how well I'm coping. Even my therapist is shocked at how well I'm doing. Don't be fooled though-- I'm still having to cope. I am using so much effort coping with this loss that I have 0 coping mechanisms left for anything else.

If you count my D&C as ""day 1"" of my new cycle, I got a negative hcg test at day 16. I'm sure others have mentioned that OPKs pick up HCG, so they will be positive until your HCG is negative. What I didn't expect is to have a medium-faint LH test line for weeks after my negative pregnancy test. Before I was pregnant, I didn't have anything show up for the LH test line until right before the surge. I have not had (what I would consider to be) my period yet. I started spotting on day 36, and spotted for 3 days. I had atrocious PMS symptoms (and all my previous early pregnancy symptoms) the two weeks before, and it was about 4 weeks after my negative HCG (some people say start your cycle day 1 from the negative HCG test), so I really felt like it was coming. I often spot before my period. But a ""real"" period never came. My first LH surge post-D&C was day 54 of my cycle (last week), and about 2.5 weeks after the spotting - so who knows maybe that was my period and I hadn't built up much of a lining yet.

I started temping a little after the spotting, and did confirm temperature spike 2 days after the LH surge, so I am hoping this means my body is back on track.

I&#39;m sure others have mentioned that OPKs pick up HCG, so they will be positive until your HCG is negative. What I didn&#39;t expect is to have a medium-faint LH test line for weeks after my negative pregnancy test. Before I was pregnant, I didn&#39;t have anything show up for the LH test line until right before the surge. I have not had (what I would consider to be) my period yet. I started spotting on day 36, and spotted for 3 days. I had atrocious PMS symptoms (and all my previous early pregnancy symptoms) the two weeks before, and it was about 4 weeks after my negative HCG (some people say start your cycle day 1 from the negative HCG test), so I really felt like it was coming. I often spot before my period. But a &quot;real&quot; period never came. My first LH surge post-D&amp;C was day 54 of my cycle (last week), and about 2.5 weeks after the spotting - so who knows maybe that was my period and I hadn&#39;t built up much of a lining yet.</p>

<p>I started temping a little after the spotting, and did confirm temperature spike 2 days after the LH surge, so I am hoping this means my body is back on track.</p>

<p>When your body settles back into it&#39;s natural rhythm is different for everyone. I know the lack of comfort that response brings, and I wish the best for you. Hang in there.</p>

<p>Sorry for your loss.</p>

My husband was also away with work, but this time we knew how to deal with it, I didn&#39;t try to &quot;power&quot; through, I allowed myself to stay in the pain. I feel like that is super important: Allow yourself to be hurt. We waited longer before trying again, until I got to the point where I wasn&#39;t thinking about previous due dates anymore. (TW: LC)   </p>

<p>When we did start trying again I got pregnant right away. It was not the happiest pregnancy, I was worried and avoided any risk. However, I made it through and we have a healthy baby. I know now that I would be a different mom without the MCs. I would be a worse mom, honestly. Having the MCs taught me that not everything can be planned, chance plays a bigger factor in my life than I had expected. It also influences how I see my baby. With the MCs I always had a feeling that the embryos were male. Now I have a daughter, and in my mind, she is just supergirl :-) </p>

I just want to say I'm right there with you only a few months ahead. I had the same mmc last may and then a BO with a SCH in November. The number one thing that has helped me is seeing an assisted reproductive therapy specialist. 

Here's what is next, and what I wish I had known a few months ago: See if your insurance covers the recurrent pregnancy loss panel. If they do, go for it. It's like 18 vials of blood so have someone drive you to the appointment. If they don't and you're not naturally wealthy, ask for the tests MINUS the drug panel. I got my results back and they had checked me for cocaine when I've never even been drunk. That's when I decided to change doctors. 

The specialist will look in your uterus and do some more tests. In particular, make sure you ask for the MTHFR test. My first doctor didn't want to give it, but it's a gene mutation that I have and will have to take special meds for it. They'll also test for a bunch of other stuff that isn't in the pregnancy loss panel. 

I had to have a hysteroscopy to clear out the blighted ovum. I just got my period back last week and now they're tracking my cycle this month. They also found some cysts on my ovaries (12 on one, 14 on the other) which barely puts me at a risk for PCOS. They said 12 cysts were in the normal range, so I'm barely over. Still, it's worth having my progesterone checked throughout my cycle once I get pregnant. 

I also found a new OBGYN whom I love. He's checking my cortisol levels this month. 

I went in for baselines yesterday and I'm going in next week for a trigger shot to make sure I ovulate. The week after, they'll check my progesterone to make sure it's increasing in the event I am pregnant. 

Everything moves fast with the specialists. That's helped me a lot. I also have a lot of trouble thinking that a blighted ovum is the result of something being wrong with me. Everything I've heard just says that it's bad luck. I just turned 31 on Sunday, so we're close to the same age, too. If you want more information about what they did for me -- especially since it's so similar -- send me a message. I have reimbursement insurance, so I have itemized receipts for everything.

I just want to add science for the ladies relying on hpt's to determine if their pregnancy is progressing normally:

Home pregnancy tests are a qualitative method of testing for pregnancy. Its main purpose is to tell you ""yes"" or ""no"" for pregnancy. Some women have had numbers over the 1000s and gotten a shy faint line. Whilst others have 23ml and test blazingly positive. I had 100ml the first time i got a beta done, and only then did I get a shy positive on a HPT (sensitivity of this test was also 20ml). 

HPT's are not a good method in testing whether your pregnancy is progressing normally. You should not be using it as such. The results are skewed as well depending on the amount of water in your urine.

There are two types of blood tests: Qualitative Quantitative

Qualitative works the same as a hpt.

Quantitative tells you exactly how much of the HCG hormone is in your blood and is the only way in checking if your pregnancy is progressing normally in the early stages. A rising number is a good number. So don't get so hung up over the numbers either. So once you've confirmed pregnancy via blood test, stop using your HPT's. You are possibly going to stress yourself out unnecessarily. They mean nothing. Please please ladies go ask your doctors about HPT's, (my doctor is totally against HPT's for this reason). In the future when you fall pregnant again you might stress yourself out for no reason.

My loss was at 16 weeks, so not a stillbirth, but there's a chance it could have been prevented with better medical care. I was carrying  mono-di identical twins, and they developed a disease of the placenta called Twin-to-Twin Transfusion Syndrome (TTTS) that is sometimes treatable with surgery if noticed in time, but is 99% fatal to both twins if left untreated. In order to monitor for TTTS (which occurs in as much as one fourth of identical twin pregnancies), it's standard practice to have ultrasounds every one or two weeks for the entirety of the pregnancy. I didn't know this at the time. The doctor who did my first ultrasound at 8 weeks apparently forgot to write the word ""twins"" on my paperwork, and also neglected to change the status of my pregnancy to ""high risk,"" as all identical twin pregnancies should be classified. I wasn't scheduled for another ultrasound until my NT scan at 13 weeks. The MFM was shocked to see I was carrying identical twins (because it wasn't in my paperwork) and told me I needed to have another scan in a week because they were already showing a fluid imbalance that might be indicative of TTTS. Well, my OB was booked solid for three weeks and refused to squeeze me in. I went in for my third scan at 16 weeks, and neither baby had a heartbeat.

It's been two years. I haven't sued. I think I was too confused and emotionally drained from the experience to do anything like that.

High risk ob‚Äôs are much more attentive and tend to air on the side of caution more often. Unfortunately it is really hard to find a doctor after you‚Äôve had one (excuse my language but) fuck up so badly,  it makes it hard to trust a new doctor even if they are really great. I am currently working with a fertility Endo chronologist, a prenatal specialist, and a high risk Obgyn. We did not choose to sue, my mother is an attorney and thought we had a good case after discussing and showing my medical records to a few different doctors. I left it up to my husband, I told him I couldn‚Äôt go through a lawsuit, but if he wanted to I would tough it out. I do have to say looking back I do wish at the very least we would have gotten my medical bills cleared. Every time they send me a bill I instantly get angry rip it up and throw it out. My husband has tried to pay it a few times and I just can‚Äôt bring myself to give them a dime. </p>

My dr told me to wait one cycle.  I am just curious why the time to wait and try again varies so much. I‚Äôm sending all my thoughts and prayers your way. I am glad you are seeing someone to help you get through this. My inbox is always open if you need to talk.</p>

How Long Should You Wait Before Getting Pregnant After Giving Birth?

Both the American Congress of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) and the March of Dimes recommend that couples should wait at least a full year and ideally 18 months after having a baby before getting pregnant again. That‚Äôs because conceiving within 18 months of giving birth increases the odds of some complications in the following pregnancy, including having a premature and/or low-birth weight baby ‚Äî especially if conception occurs within six months of birth. That can, in turn, increase the risk of a child having asthma, developmental delays and vision and hearing problems later in life.

Experts aren‚Äôt sure why, exactly, shorter intervals between pregnancies has been linked to these complications. It may be because there‚Äôs residual inflammation in the uterus from the previous pregnancy, and because the body doesn‚Äôt have enough time to fully replenish the vitamins and nutrients required for the following pregnancy.

I have two more questions:

1.Part of me just feels like this is bad luck. Blighted ovums just happen, right? They could happen to anyone. The other one could be MTHFR or any other of non-avoidable things. Miscarriages are horrible, but they do just happen sometimes. Does anyone else just feel like the next one (or maybe the one after that) will work or am I being dumb?  I'm the most pessimistic person ever, so it's weird to have a gut feeling that everything will be OK.

&#x200B;

2. How did you learn about all of this stuff? I know the basics of reproduction, but the doctors are practically speaking code to me and expecting me to understand it. I've got an E2, FSH, and LH this week. Then a CBC at some point in the month. How did you all learn the lingo?

<p>We did all the testing; we are in Canada, so luckily everything is covered. All came back fine. The most frustrating part for me is that I‚Äôll never know if the losses were related. Am I doomed to keep miscarrying? Right now, I‚Äôm seeing a hematologist to do some further blood disorder testing as we are going to start trying again the next few months. </p>

<p>What you said about seeing the positive test is so true. I know I will totally freak when I see it and will not feel even remotely safe until I can get past the # of weeks of the losses. Miscarriage can truly be a thief of hope. </p>

<p>Anyway, I just wanted to share my story and relate. I understand your feelings so, so deeply ‚ù§Ô∏è</p>
