I know in my heart that people mean well but those 'comforting' words/sayings hurt. The only real words of comfort are 'I'm sorry for your loss' and a private hug. Or even just a hug and no words. I appreciated the hug when I went back to work, I wasn't ready to talk about it but my coworker gave me a hug. 
If you've also suffered a loss I appreciate when the stories are shared of your loss, it's nice to know you're not alone when it feels like your world is crushed. 

One other thing that meant the world to me is when someone knew my baby's name (Mackenzie) and they would use his name. It makes me feel good that his name is being used, it gives me a small sense of peace that he won't be forgotten. 

Also, if you are friends or family with someone who suffered a loss, just be understanding that there are good days and awful days. Understand that if they make plans with you and are having an awful day, don't hold it against them if they decide last minute that they don't want to go out or see anyone. And especially if you are expecting. There are two people who are expecting in my husband's family and I've been avoiding them since my loss a few months ago. It just hurts to be reminded of what I've lost. I hurt enough without the reminder. But if they are still hanging out then just be thoughtful and don't talk only about your pregnancy or children. 

Shortly after our loss the in laws would not stop talking about their grandchildren, and it hurt so much because there will never be a time when they talk about my baby. I loved him just as much as anyone loves their child. But he's gone now and only my husband and I will probably ever talk about him now. And it breaks my heart.

Another said, ""I was right!!"" As in, she'd guessed I was going to have a boy. Excuse me, are you seriously celebrating my dead son?

I've noticed that when I share about my loss, then that can elicit comments from other women about their loss or who they have known who have also experienced a loss. This has really helped me and can help other women who have experienced loss feel less alone, but be mindful about this information (especially for those sharing on behalf of someone else). 

A ""sharing about loss"" moment that was positive and made me feel connected and less alone in my experience came from my great-aunt. When I told her about our loss, she said something like the following: ""This is a big blow. I am so sorry and know you must be hurting. I had a miscarriage between [first son] and [second son] and that experience has always been a part of me and I still remember the cold attitude my doctor showed me to make me feel like it wasn't a big deal."" 

In other words, if you want to share about another loss, I'd limit it to express the following message: your loss matters and I share my/my friend/family member's experience to communicate you are not alone nor should you feel alone if you are experiencing feelings of failure or receiving indifference or negativity from doctors, family, or other people in your life about it. 

Caveats About Sharing About Other Losses

- Don't frame it in a  ""grief contest/comparison"" where the intention may be to try to offer perspective, but can come across as minimizing a loss (""my friend lost her baby in such and such way that was later/had more losses/was more serious than you lost yours""). This can imply/suggest that somehow your loss should be easier to process/recover from or isn't as serious. 

- Don't use other ""loss then success"" experiences to try to encourage the woman (""my friend had x number of losses and then finally got her rainbow!""). You don't know where that woman is at right now and honestly - if she has access to the Internet - have no doubt she has likely read for hours online about ""success after loss"" experiences herself. If she wants to find those stories, they are out there. 

- Don't frame other loss stories to suggest/impose a timeline for grief (""This is so hard now, but my friend was back to herself after x months and you will be too""). Again - I know it's framed in the good intent of ""it will get better"" but you don't want to pressure someone to think about how soon or how fast they ""should"" be processing their loss. 

- Don't frame an experience about another loss to give advice about what that woman should be doing to get pregnant (""after her loss, my friend just started taking this supplement, did this procedure, saw this kind of specialist so you should too""). You just have no idea if that's what that woman needs or if she's interested in further interventions at that moment or ever. She might want to take some time for herself and not be ready to try again, for heterosexual couples she might just want to reframe sex as fun again and not think about procreation (so NTNP for a while), and she likely already knows about everything available under the sun to try to improve conception and has already decided it's not for her, or she can't afford it, or doesn't have a doctor open to those methods and has less or no flexibility in changing doctors or health plans.

Again - I know it&#39;s framed in the good intent of &quot;it will get better&quot; but you don&#39;t want to pressure someone to think about how soon or how fast they &quot;should&quot; be processing their loss. </p></li>
<li><p>Don&#39;t frame an experience about another loss to give advice about what that woman should be doing to get pregnant (&quot;after her loss, my friend just started taking this supplement, did this procedure, saw this kind of specialist so you should too&quot;). You just have no idea if that&#39;s what that woman needs or if she&#39;s interested in further interventions at that moment or ever. She might want to take some time for herself and not be ready to try again, for heterosexual couples she might just want to reframe sex as fun again and not think about procreation (so NTNP for a while), and she likely already knows about everything available under the sun to try to improve conception and has already decided it&#39;s not for her, or she can&#39;t afford it, or doesn&#39;t have a doctor open to those methods and has less or no flexibility in changing doctors or health plans. </p></li>

I remember the first of those waves, with all the October dates for friends I was so happy for, and how quiet things were in TTC, and watching all of the alumni standalone posts pop up, and watching the post numbers being so dramatically higher in alumni versus TTC.  I found it even harder at times when the people transitioning were people who had been around for as long or longer than I had, because even though I was so very happy for them, I missed their ""voices"".  And then as TTC began to ""catch up"", it was filled with newer voices and fresher grief.  And that is hard in its own way.

One of the things I have always liked about what this subreddit has been in the past (maybe the culture has changed/is changing though) is that it is a more hopeful subreddit than places like r/miscarriage or r/infertility, where we were able to have a bit of (somewhat shaky) belief that it would all work out, and that (sometimes bare minimum) optimism was fostered.  It was a place where we wanted to know when our friends got positive tests (without having to wade through current pregnancy updates to see it), where we could (carefully) mention LCs without trigger warnings, where we wanted to keep everyone together so that we could maintain hope and be there to support our friends either way things went.  I wish that culture could continue to be encouraged.

I love how our community continues to grow and to create supports for its members - loved loved the idea of the weekly WTT thread and remember a time when I would have desperately wished for such a thing.  The idea of a weekly questions thread is really interesting and would solve this dilemma for me personally - would be nice to have the descriptor that it is a place for questions that are more related to significant issues that you want more exposure than the daily thread.  That said, I would suggest that there should be a weekly questions thread for both TTC and alumni if it were created.  What I would not want to do is create yet another triggering weekly thread - I was - am - as guilty as the next person in clicking into triggering threads on days when I really shouldn't.  It's easier to avoid a thread (such as daily updates) when there is a TTC counterpart (unlike weekly results - I really wish the two weeks did not overlap). 

As a complete aside, I really wish the mods would take off the ""pregnant"" tag on the alumni thread - it was named alumni for a reason, and there was a lot of debate about it to make it as least triggering as possible.

Don't think anyone other than us will see our discussion though - which is the whole reason this kind of thread would be nice, lol.

Thank you so very much for your kindness.  I really do love this community, and I want to feel comfortable here instead of guilty and triggering, even though I know I have become one of those people that would have made me feel a bit melancholy in the past.  And I feel like that is selfish of me!  But - I've just been a bit lonely.

At this point I&#39;ve accepted it as doing what I need to do in order to get through a difficult time in my life. Instead I carefully choose how I spend my time and who I spend my time with. It&#39;s not in total isolation, I am just more at ease in certain situations, so I give myself permission to do those things and decline others.</p>

---- I read your post on babybumps and commented; I'm glad to see you made it here. What I copied above really pissed me off for you. Someone said like ""I'm due around you and blah blah blah"". Why would they say that? Why would you want to hear that? They just don't understand. It was my worst nightmare too. And you know what? When it happened, it was a million times worse than that ""worst nightmare"" I had imagined. They don't actually know what it is like to answer questions on whether you want a funeral or autopsy for your baby, to have to go through that.

You're sad for you. You're making it about you. You have no fucking clue. My due date was yesterday, hers is coming up. It's hard. She can't even look at me or talk to me.

I know it took about 5 days for me to really start accepting what happened. The first few days I think I seemed normal to people who came and visited. It was later it became much harder, and continues to be hard. It's not as hard as it was a month or two after it happened, but it affects me every single day, my interactions with people, my relationship with my husband and family.

I think it's ok to feel down and scared and all the little things *can* add up. I don't think anything that you're feeling is abnormal or wrong. It's just very hard to trust and believe that things will go right when all you know is pain and heartache (and I know that even though you have an *ADORABLE* little boy every pregnancy of yours has been tinged with loss). 

I do want to add that it is absolutely OK for you to still be a member of the general community. Up until very recently (thank you IRS), I have been a very active member of both the Alum and TTC communities. There are many in the TTC community who may not even know that my wife is pregnant, actually, based on the things they say to me. I just very, very studiously avoid mentioning or even hinting about it anywhere but here. 

I know what you mean about feeling left behind, caught in between. It's part of the TTCforfuckingever experience. Many of the people who experienced loss around the same time and were the people we have supported and who supported us have moved on. On the flip side, many of the people we bonded with in the TTCforfuckingever club are still TTCforfuckingever - like hippo (it seriously breaks my heart every single day that life has given her such a raw deal where fertility and loss are concerned). So where does that leave us, people who were definitely TTCforfuckingever, left behind by so many of our friends, but have now miraculously moved on, leaving behind the few who were our closest allies and friends? We, my friend, are in the middle. I know it's tough, I know there are days when the worry and fear and general disappointment that things aren't the way they should be are overwhelming. But I hope that there are days where there is some joy, and hope, and optimism - I think that'll get easier the further along you get.

I am still very thankful that we can experience at least a part of this together - I know it's not the same as if we had conceived again easily, and moved on with most of our TTCAL friends. I know it's also not the same either as if the entire TTCforfuckingever club could have moved on together (how wonderful and fitting would that have been) - but its something.

As you said, the subreddit IS a TTC sub.

<p>I hope you can get the support you need here and feel welcome. Because you truly are. I&#39;ve always admired you and enjoyed &quot;getting to know you&quot;. :)</p>

<p>With all that said, I DO think the recent changes here shows we may need to evolve a bit.  What would your (and others) thoughts be on maybe a once a week thread (sort of like results is now) for &quot;Weekly Alumni Questions&quot;...(with a better name)? It would still allow for the big questions to not get buried in the daily Alum thread and still give people a chance to avoid the thread if it&#39;s triggering...thoughts, anyone? Mods? :)   (maybe I should pose this elsewhere so it gets more visability)</p>

I ended up emailing my dr. around 12 saying I had been having either a super light period or pre period spotting for a few days, and that it was black and clotty that morning. Was super surprised when the nurse at their office called 10 mins later and asked if I could come in, but I left work early and went.

They had me pee in a cup, not even telling me it was for a pregnancy test, but apparently it was, because when the dr finally came in the room she told me the test was positive. She gave me an exam and said my cervix was open and pulled out like a half inch black leech looking clot which was really gross and kind of embarrassing. 

No ultrasound tech was in the office so she gave me the probe instead, which was actually great because she could tell me things! Said my lining was really thin, almost non-existent and asked again for me to explain how heavy the period/spotting I'd been having was.

So apparently with lining so thin she's worried that the egg wouldn't be able to attach at all, especially not for long enough to put out HCG (later yesterday found out HCG was 14). Which means this could be ectopic. So going in for more blood work today and Monday and possibly after that too to monitor my HCG. She said my HCG should drop to 0 No later than Monday if it was an early MC, and if it doesn't, or goes down but then back up, it's likely ectopic and I'd have the get methotrexate shots and not TTC for 3 months! 

I think I'm still in shock because I haven't cried that much. I'm terrified it's ectopic. I also realized when I got home I never asked her why I had black blood which was the reason for the appt in the first place. I don't know what the due date would have been and I never pictured life with this baby so I don't really feel sad for its loss. I'm still more sad about the first one honestly that should be here in January! 

If anything I'm just scared and mad. If this is ectopic then we won't even be able to try again until January. That means it will have been 11 months since we started NTNP and we would only have gotten to try twice and NTNP twice in that whole time and it just makes me so angry to think that!

Had a saline ultrasound yesterday, they found a 1cm lesion. RE said no risk in trying to get pregnant or to a pregnancy, but might have reduced chances of getting pregnant this cycle.

Also scheduled a consult with a genetics counselor next week to review my genetic carrier results (earliest available). A little annoying knowing the results are in but have to wait to review them.

We've been getting settled into our new house, getting ready to have a housewarming party and looking for a dog.

I went through an EP last October, I'm coming up on my year mark and I'm just now really processing it. I think between the year mark and my best friend and sister both being pregnant is probably a trigger. 

For me, they speculated it was ectopic but they couldn't find the sac. After multiple blood tests and ultrasounds I ended up getting a shot of methotrexate which cleared it out. It was extremely painful for me because the pain drugs they gave me caused constipation. When it all started moving around I ended up in the hospital (I didn't know constipation was the culprit at the time). It was the most excruciating pain I've ever been in (and I've had appendicitis and gallstones at the same time)...I even collapsed outside the ER doors. It was so pathetic, my husband and I laugh about it now though, cause what else can you do? So learn from me. DO NOT LET PAIN KILLERS CONSTIPATE YOU. 

Anyway, I think I stopped bleeding after a week and then it took another several weeks before I was able to get up and back to my life. I didn't know what to expect or who to talk to, so I just lay in bed googling constantly. I ended up calling my cousin who's a doctor about it and he said to just pay attention to how I was feeling (I didn't want to get an infection). I had a lot of pelvic floor pain, even just from peeing, but it all eventually went away and my hcg levels went to 0 after about a month. There is a light at the end of the tunnel, and it's not far. I was able to keep my fallopian tube, but I still get pain on that side sometimes. 

My sister also went through an EP and she lost a tube. Just found out last weekend that she's pregnant again. Hang in there! It's so rough, but all things pass. PLEASE contact me if you have any questions or just need some support and a good old fashioned pep talk. I'm serious.

My post shot hcg did not drop as much as my OB wanted them to so she referred me to a reproductive endocrinologist who did a biopsy of my uterus to make sure it was really ectopic and not just hiding and then put me through a second round of methotrexate. I'm heavy, so I speculate that may have had something to do with the effectiveness of round 1.  It took me about 30 days from the first shot to be considered not pregnant.

I made a little chart with comparing my DPO and hcg.  http://imgur.com/Ax6xL1V 

It was 62 days from the first shot to my first period (not including the 15 day slow bleed after methotrexate), and then I was crazy irregular so it was six months from the first shot until we started to try again.  They say you should wait 3 cycles at minimum.  I had an HSG done before we tried again just to inspect the plumbing and everything was clear.  Make sure you follow those instructions like don't eat green leafy veggies or take prenatals until your hcg is under 5.  Stay out of the sun for a little while because you'll be prone to sunburns.  Methotrexate is a chemotherapy drug so it'll make you nauseated and tired for a while. Drink water like it's your job to flush the crap out of your system.

Take care of yourself, I'm sorry for your loss.  If you ever need to commiserate feel free to PM me.

I just went through an ectopic ordeal, so feel free to check my post history about methotrexate. My levels were much much lower - they fluctuated between 4.5 and 45 - going up and down - for almost two months. However, my research revealed that with levels like yours it can still take quite a bit for them to come down. Docs want to see a 15% drop from day 4 to day 7 after the shot. Did you have that drop?  Weekly blood draws do suck, but as long as they're going down and not up or remaining the same, it's all good. I wouldn't worry about the steepness of the drop between draws, just that they're dropping. Are you having any spotting or bleeding yet? It may take some time for that to happen and once you're finishing bleeding you may find that the hcg zeros out. 

I think standard practice is to administer a second dose of methotrexate before considering surgery, so try not to worry too much about that option just yet. 

Here's my breakdown, just for reference: 
HCG 1 day before metho = 30
Day 4 after = 37
Day 7 after = 30 (18 percent drop) 
1 week later = 7 
1 week after that = <1 

So it took like 3 weeks for an hcg of 30 to zero out for me...so I'd imagine yours could take a bit longer. That being said, I've seen women with higher numbers have their levels decline and resolve very rapidly. Please let me know if you have any questions! I'm happy to chat more about it.

I wouldn&#39;t worry about the steepness of the drop between draws, just that they&#39;re dropping. Are you having any spotting or bleeding yet? It may take some time for that to happen and once you&#39;re finishing bleeding you may find that the hcg zeros out. </p>

<p>I think standard practice is to administer a second dose of methotrexate before considering surgery, so try not to worry too much about that option just yet. </p>

<p>Here&#39;s my breakdown, just for reference: 
HCG 1 day before metho = 30
Day 4 after = 37
Day 7 after = 30 (18 percent drop) 
1 week later = 7 
1 week after that = &lt;1 </p>

<p>So it took like 3 weeks for an hcg of 30 to zero out for me...so I&#39;d imagine yours could take a bit longer. That being said, I&#39;ve seen women with higher numbers have their levels decline and resolve very rapidly. Please let me know if you have any questions! I&#39;m happy to chat more about it. Take care of yourself &lt;3 </p>

To answer your progesterone question, my wife has been on progesterone from 15 weeks on and will stop around 37 weeks (exact date TBD).

If you are taking it for suspected incompetent cervix, like my wife, they continue until you are early term and it's time to pull the cerclage.

The reason the MFM probably doesn't get first tri progesterone supplementation is there's a lot of disagreement on the practice. It's a mixed bag, with a lot of practitioners believing that low P during first tri isn't a cause of loss it's a symptom of whatever is *actually* causing the loss.

I don't post a lot but I still read the Alumni thread every day to keep up with everyone's stories :). Yesterday was a big, giant win for me and I wanted to share it. (TW: mention of previous TMFR) It's a novel so bear with me. 
After three losses and months of mismanaged care I switched to my current OB. She is fabulous. Between her and my psychologist I was pretty much back on my feet emotionally. Unfortunately, the hospital where she delivers is not in network so I planned on transferring my care back to the ""good"" doctor at the old practice. I spoke with my current OB & my therapist and felt like it was something I could do (note: the midwife who had completely fucked up my NIPT T21 counseling which caused me to TMFR without confirmation had been fired from this practice). So I called to make my appointments and had a full-on panic attack. I wrote a tell-all letter to the insurance company explaining that I have PTSD for the previous losses and lackluster care. I even went into the TMFR. Keep in mind this insurance is Catholic and they own the Cathloic hospital system where they want me to deliver. I called the next day to see if my appeal could be fast tracked since I deliver in 9 weeks and got the run around. The call was eventually bounced to the patient advocate I had been assigned when I initially appealed. My initial appeal was denied as medically unnecessary because I had requested a water birth since I knew those were only done where my OB delivered.
The patient advocate read my letter and set up a meeting with the grievance committee who only meets every 6-8 weeks. I lucked out. She requested I send my medical records to the committee and my therapist also sent a letter. 
I met with the committee of 12 clinical and non-clinical personel yesterday. One member was a priest. They ran 15 minutes late while discussing my 231 pages of chart notes. The patient advocate said my chart notes ""horrified"" some of the committee and suggested I open an investigation when I am emotionally ready. My husband pushed me to let him come with me for support and I'm glad he did. He read my statement while I sat and cried. My statement addressed the fact that I was never told to confirm my T21 diagnosis with amnio, I was never given a timeline for legally terminating and I had to go to a women's center for my TFMR. I went onto describe the mismanagement of my partial molar diagnosis from original US to the doc telling me to simply ""try again"" when she called to give me my pathology results. I contrasted this with the care I recieved under my current OB which included a loss treated with (Mifeprex/misoprostol). I noted that my care at the previous office may have been hampered by Catholic doctrine. Guys, I spoke about having a TFMR in front of 12 strangers including a priest. They were all very empathetic. 
The verdict, one insurance woman and the priest both asked me if I would be willing to help with process improvement to make sure no woman was ever given incorrect or incomplete information that may result in an unnecessary TFMR. They voted to allow me to deliver with my current OB and cover the costs as in-network before I left the building. I am overwhelmed that all of the shitty things I have been handed over the last 2.5 years may actually help other women in similar situations. I also can't help but think it's special that the little girl I lost to TFMR Will have a part in the story of my daughter's birth.

I wish I'd done it sooner.

At our first appointment my doctor asked me all the dates of our losses and about any symptoms/etc. He looked over both our general heath questionnaires and asked some questions for verification. He looked at my charts/temping data and discussed my cycles with me.  He looked at the list of tests I'd already had done, asked me to repeat a couple and set up some new ones.

He gave us a plan of attack, basically...told us what he was looking for with the tests he'd ordered. Told us what he'd do if the tests came back positive or negative -- further testing if needed, etc. I basically knew from that 1st appointment that if all my bloodwork came back fine that he'd request a biopsy/etc. He was clear in his plan and I really liked knowing what the alternate plans were, depending on results.

I have spoken to many women who have been disappointed with their specialists. We got a good one, so I'm thankful. But the most common ""horror stories"" I hear are about specialists who seem to dismiss your thoughts and concerns. Or any data/etc you want to share.  Please advocate for yourself -- know that if your doctor doesn't think something matters, they can explain why in a nice way. They don't have to and should not just dismiss you. 

As you've had 2 losses, some doctors won't do a whole panel workup...but they can. And if your insurance covers it and/or you just want it no matter what, then push for it. Its your body and your life. And nobody should have to wait for more and more losses to get things checked out. 

Also, while testing can definitely find issues...often it doesn't. More than 75% of women who get a recurrent loss panel find nothing wrong. This can be incredibly frustrating and makes the testing feel like a double edged sword. But finding no issues IS actually good...being healthy is good, right? :) And your prognosis for a healthy pregnancy after loss is still quite high. So while I understanding wanting to find something and fix it (I sat around hoping for a thyroid problem or something!), try to realize that might not happen. 

It's great you're moving forward and seeing the doctor. Having answers, even if its ""everything is fine and we don't know what is happening"", can help relieve you because you are doing everything you possibly can. And that's smart and wonderful of you to do.

As I said, I've had tons of tests done...if you get to that point and want to talk about any of them, feel free to message me. :)

A little over a year ago, we moved away from the home we loved.  The reasons were good - my husband's job was going nowhere and there were no other jobs in that town for him.  The job he has no has opportunities, much better pay, etc.  But it meant moving away from our home, our church (that was the first one we both really loved), our friends.  So it has been a tough year.

In a week, we're going back.  My husband has to go for a grad student's defense (he was in academia and is still on her committee), and we need to finally pick up the travel trailer we left with friends.  I'm going to have a work meeting while we're there, and then I think we're going to go to church so we can see our church friends.

I'm a bit dreading that visit, though.  When we left, I was pregnant (no one knew because it was so early).  Plus, I am just SO SAD that we don't live there. I could have stayed there the rest of my life.

The last time we went to church, a couple of the women told us they hoped when we came back I would be pregnant or have another baby.  I imagine they're going to ask or say something.  They're not mean or even really thoughtless, they want us to have what we want.  I've made a commitment to myself that I'm going to tell people when they ask that we have had miscarriages, so this will probably be the first test of how that goes.

On the other hand, I AM so looking forward to eating at some of my favorite places and seeing friends.

Other's happiness, especially when its something we want SO MUCH, is definitely triggering. There's no reason to feel guilty about that -- its just how you feel. Its a real emotional thing and you have every reason to feel it. 

Try to realize that its likely temporary -- you aren't likely to forever feel this way, but for now you just need to be easy on yourself and grieve. Hide those pregnant people from your Facebook, or stay off Facebook. Set boundaries with the people who actually talk to regularly, if you need them to stop triggering you.

Anyway, I had one midwife who I saw throughout my heartbreaking delivery of Clare and follow up care and talked to several times on the phone when I got pregnant again. I trust her and know that she gets my story without having to explain it. If I tell her some concerns, she knows better than to wave them away (which everyone else seems to do.

So, they don't let you see the same midwife throughout pregnancy - I have a stranger tomorrow and I feel, like, PTSD bringing worries up. I did that earlier this year (""My uterus feels too small!"" ""It's fiiiiine."" It wasn't fine.) I want to ask about weight gain, but also dread the dismissiveness. 

I really just wish they would let me see the high risk OB. Sigh. They are SO much more sensitive there. (I'm a pretty crunchy person, so I never thought I'd see the day where I didn't love my midwives!) Ugggh. 

In happier news, I can feel the top of my uterus now! It's really growing! I hope that placenta is developed and going to have no problems whatsoever this pregnancy. Come on, buddy. You can do it.

There's a charity in Britain called Aching Arms that send out teddy bears to bereaved parents so that they have something to hold when they leave hospital with empty arms.

Thanks to everyone for your support this week as I tackled marathon doctors appointments. Yesterday I had the bone marrow biopsy. Guess who had another, yes, another pregnant nurse?? They are all around! I was nervous and had to get an IV, which I've never had before. The pregnant nurse stuck me once and couldn't get it to work. Sensing I was nervous and becoming increasingly anxious, she brought her overly bubbly and annoyingly cheerful nurse friend to take over who promptly asked me if I was married and had kids. Then she blew my vein in that same arm. I have a huge purple knot there now. She got the IV in the other arm and both nurses told me the docs give pain meds and Ativan through the IV - yay! 

But then, NO! We get back to the doc who says he didn't plan on giving me meds, he usually doesn't unless absolutely necessary. You all would be proud of me. I said, and I quote: ""I was just stuck three times trying to get this IV in, I was told there would be meds, I am already wound up from that. I had a painful procedure done yesterday and I do not want to feel any pain today, I want drugs"" and he got them for me. Morphine and Ativan! Ugh it was delightful. Never had an IV drug before - hits in seconds. The nurse brought me a warm blanket and asked if I'd like to listen to music. I said sure - Oldies. So she played CCR, Lynyrd Skynyrd and Janis Joplin ""Cry Baby"" we laughed because the song was appropriate as I wanted drugs and was being a baby. The doc said he'll not forget this - performing a biopsy while Lynryd Skynyrd is blasting in the background. I felt absolutely no pain from the biopsy - just pressure and it was over in 10 mins. I was so grateful to have advocated for myself instead of listening to the damn doctor. I knew what I needed at that time and it was a great decision. Today, my back feels like someone hit me with a baseball bat, but at least I felt nothing while it was being drilled into!

<p>Medical:  I have an appointment in 4 weeks to do some blood work and see if maybe that played a factor.  So far my stillbirth is unexplained.  I&#39;m looking for a new doctor too, I need a fresh start.  My right boob is still crying every now and then, but otherwise my bleeding is almost gone and I&#39;ve returned to my pre-baby weight.  It feels wrong, I feel like I should still be pregnant. </p>

<p>Non-medical:  I have started seeing a grief councilor and make a point to leave the house once a day.  My work called today so I think I have to get back to real life soon and I&#39;m dreading it.  I&#39;m still struggling to figure out how I&#39;m supposed to go on without my baby.

I got married in May 2015 and we started TTC in the Fall/Winter of 2015.

I was eager to try again and as soon as I had a normal cycle we began TTC. I got pregnant again in July and less than a week after my BFP I miscarried.

I'm honestly relieved to have a clean slate and hoping it all passes on its own.

I was always so eager to keep trying but I'm finally at a point where I can't fathom another loss right now so I am taking time to heal. We are also going to work with an RE and maybe a perinatologist going forward, get all the testing done etc to hopefully have better odds at a successful pregnancy.

In the meantime I really look forward to self-care. I spent the last year getting as healthy as can be and lost 25 lbs. Now 3 losses later I've really let myself go and I'm feeling awful about that. So my self care plan is to get back into healthy habits, eating a healthier diet, and running which I love but have abandoned this past month due to first trimester nausea and fatigue. I'm looking forward to really getting my body back once the pregnancy hormones are gone.

Sorry you are going through this. I would definitely gather up your questions and schedule a time to talk to him. I would strongly encourage you to get educated and push him on the laproscopy issue. That's pretty intense surgery, and from what I'd uncovered in my research, not the #1 course of action for more uterine issues, especially polyps and scarring.

Hysteroscopy with an experienced surgeon gives full visualization without being invasive (or potentially causing more scarring)! There is a lot of info in the Asherman's Yahoo Group. I highly recommend it to read through the literature and ask questions of the group. Really helpful stuff. 

As for waiting, I got my period back in 4 weeks after my hysteroscopy, waited another full cycle (though I was cleared immediately) for my own sanity, and then conceived on the next go around. (about 14 weeks now, fingers crossed).

I'm glad you have concrete plans in place to move forward. I think therapy in place of meds sounds like a good move. And GO YOU GO for doing C25K! I did a similar thing a few years ago - 5K Runner was the app, and I ended up running an actual 5k without stopping and it helped me (a lifelong hater of running) learn to love to run. Perhaps I'll try a program such as this. 

My WTT situation is: recovered from 2 month ectopic mess and now am having a bunch of tests run to see what's up. My HSG revealed a polyp and something else concerning, potentially scarring or adhesions. While no one is telling us NOT to try, it just doesn't feel right to try when I know there are things going on that could cause another loss, ya know? Like why risk it? I have a feeling that doctors are just like ""yeah, go ahead...try...couldn't hurt"" but YEAH IT COULD HURT. I could have another loss with a polyp and a fucked up tube. So I'm thinking that maybe a few months of rest, relaxation, self-care and getting fit while we see what's up on my insides is a good plan. Looking at it in this way - and modeling the path you're on - really helps frame this is as a positive and not a negative. We all want babies, and creating an environment where we give ourselves the best chance of a healthy pregnancy just makes sense. It suuuucks that its more waiting and not the time frame that I want, but it is what it is. 

So, self care: I've had a lot of procedures this week, and I have more to come in the next few, so I plan to get a massage that my husband got me for our anniversary as soon as my back isn't sore anymore. I am seeing a health coach through work who is going to weigh me and do body fat percentage and all that jazz on Friday, so I'll have a baseline as I began to get my ass in gear.

I've had two chemical pregnancies and two first trimester miscarriages. I remember being excited for maybe an hour when I saw the positive test for the last one.

Finding a therapist who specializes in infertility/grief/loss can really help.I know it sounds scary to say these things out loud. Hell, I was crying on the phone with the consult for mine. Therapy is not a commitment, it doesn't mean there is something wrong with you, and getting these thoughts out and off your chest can do amazing things. Doing this before your baby comes might help you deal with anxiety that could carry over after he is born. 

 https://therapists.psychologytoday.com/rms/ is how I found mine.

I have a feeling that what you're describing is exactly what caused my right tube to end up getting nixxed. 

I, also, had diffuse scarring all over the right side of my guts that was noted when the surgeon was doing the salpingectomy. No idea what that is from, either. I also had a decade of BC and a brief stint with an IUD. No known history of any sexually transmitted infections.

The only thing that I can think that it is, in my case, is bad Jew guts. My family has a history of having trouble at the [ileocecal junction](https://classconnection.s3.amazonaws.com/196/flashcards/4336196/jpeg/images_\(1\)-1481690FE1E0DBC9056.jpeg), seen on the lower left side (patient's right). My mum had a crazy episode where they thought she had right ovarian torsion or an ectopic pregnancy or something going on, based on ultrasound, but when they opened her up, it turned out that she was just full of adhesions and scarring and ulcers. She had a bunch of her guts removed, and she's been a-ok since. 

After my salpingectomy, the doctor was like ""You're sure you haven't been in any major accidents or had any abdominal surgery in the past?"" and I was like yeah, dude, I'm pretty sure I'd remember that shit. 

How are your poops? Do you have a history of bad gut stuff? This is all conjecture, but I do think it's rather amusing that YET AGAIN our stories mirror themselves even further. 

Also, my polyp (the one that bled for 40 days) DID disappear on its own. So as long as your polyp isn't fingering itself into any trouble, hopefully it'll get the hint and take a hike, too. 

Sending so many psychic ""WTF BODY"" hugs!

Good news is Baby Mango is doing great and is 33w2d today. He's still big - 90th percentile now, 4 lbs and 7 oz at his last check in.

I skipped the appointment (see work hours above and to save time for his birth). Two different nurses tried for 20 min each and then the doctor came in and started asking worrisome questions about discharge, contractions, and when she last felt him move. He took her right over to ultrasound. The little stinker is breech again - as soon as they turned on the ultrasound machine he stretched out his arms in a Y like a gymnast's landing and began furiously bicycle kicking his legs. The doctor said there's a chance he may flip back again, but went ahead and scheduled a C section for 39 weeks (10/24) in case he doesn't - that way it's already on the books and set. This suddenly feels so very close, but I can't wait to meet my little guy. I just wish he would stop scaring us! We are anxious enough without it!

I promise I'll be checking in more in the near future (and commenting on all of your lovely posts, too). I think of you all every day.

While I did not experience a loss before having my son, my pregnancy with him wasn't planned and came as a total and absolute shock. I wasn't married yet, was having a blast being fairly independent (but was still living with my boyfriend, who is my now-husband), loving life. I was even on the fence about ever having kids in the future. I was on birth control and taking it responsibly. Then, I got pregnant. 

As the pregnancy progressed, I was terrified. Not of a loss, but that I just wouldn't connect with this baby. That I wouldn't love him. That I wouldn't be a present mother and that I'd end up resenting him. I don't know where these thoughts came from but I was so, so nervous and was convinced I wouldn't be a good mom. 

Fast forward, our son was born healthy. My boyfriend-now-husband took to parenting immediately, which was a complete surprise because he was such a bachelor/Casanova in his single days/independent free spirit, but he was the best dad from day one. It made me love him (my husband) even more. It was inspiring. 

The thing nobody tells you about becoming a mom, is that it's okay to not immediately feel that love and affection for your child the nanosecond their born. You don't even really know them yet, one second they're this little wiggly ball inside you, and the next they're this mushy little potato in your arms, and boom! I'm just supposed to love this thing? Like, fuck, now what do I do? I just ran with it. I figured it out as I went. The first few weeks were emotionally really hard. I cried in the shower all the time, and could never figure out why. I was still just so scared. 

But slowly, and without my knowledge or consent, I began to love my little squishy potato. I began to know him inside and out, know his little quirks and personality, and began to see what everyone was talking about. This little being, he became mine, and I loved him. And I loved my husband. We were our own perfect yet not perfect little family. It wasn't easy, and motherhood is the hardest thing I've ever done (my son is now 2.5, and it's a good thing I love him because the terrible twos are no joke!), but I would never, ever change a thing. 

Being thrust into motherhood is a change, and it takes some adapting. I was never one of those ""love at first sight"" with my baby. It grew on me slowly. I had to get to know him. It was a process. And what I later found out, is that this was the case for *a lot* of women. Plenty of women I talked to opened up and said they didn't ""love"" their baby until time went on. It's okay to not know how you feel. It was kind of one of those things you figure out as you go. But I learned that I wasn't alone in my feelings. And you're not alone, either. 

I do urge you to speak to your doctor, and your husband. Postpartum depression is real, and it's serious. Even without being diagnosed with it, those first few weeks were insanely hard emotionally because my hormones were so all over the place, and the change of motherhood is an insane and sudden adaption. You need help in your corner. It's hard to talk about, but it's okay to feel the way you're feeling. Just don't try to keep feeling this way alone.

I began to know him inside and out, know his little quirks and personality, and began to see what everyone was talking about. This little being, he became mine, and I loved him. And I loved my husband. We were our own perfect yet not perfect little family. It wasn&#39;t easy, and motherhood is the hardest thing I&#39;ve ever done (my son is now 2.5, and it&#39;s a good thing I love him because the terrible twos are no joke!), but I would never, ever change a thing. </p>

<p>Being thrust into motherhood is a change, and it takes some adapting. I was never one of those &quot;love at first sight&quot; with my baby. It grew on me slowly. I had to get to know him. It was a process. And what I later found out, is that this was the case for <em>a lot</em> of women. Plenty of women I talked to opened up and said they didn&#39;t &quot;love&quot; their baby until time went on. It&#39;s okay to not know how you feel. It was kind of one of those things you figure out as you go. But I learned that I wasn&#39;t alone in my feelings. And you&#39;re not alone, either. </p>

<p>I do urge you to speak to your doctor, and your husband. Postpartum depression is real, and it&#39;s serious. Even without being diagnosed with it, those first few weeks were insanely hard emotionally because my hormones were so all over the place, and the change of motherhood is an insane and sudden adaption. You need help in your corner. It&#39;s hard to talk about, but it&#39;s okay to feel the way you&#39;re feeling. Just don&#39;t try to keep feeling this way alone. </p>

I hate this for you, but you've handled all the crap thrown your way very well -- even if you don't think so. 

I've had polyps removed and it wasn't so bad. I've also had basically the same procedure but for a biopsy of my lining. I am pretty sure they're the same procedure actually - the hysteroscopy.

For the polyp removal (in 2013) I was put under and in a hospital, but I later found out I didn't really need to be. I wish I'd asked more about it at the time and possibly avoided that. I later had some cramping and liiiiight bleeding for 1-2 days. They originally went looking because I was having breakthrough bleeding and irregular cycles, even on birth control. 

For the biopsy (which was recent, after my 3rd loss), they has me scheduled for going under and I asked if I had to be -- they said no. I was awake for it and it was done in my RE's office. It was very crampy and painful for a SHORT time during the procedure. Then the same recovery - cramps and some light bleeding for that day/the next day. Nothing too serious. 

I can't say how long until you can TTC, as we weren't trying during either of those times...but I was told no sex for 14 days. So I'd assume that means you miss THAT cycle and I see no reason why you couldn't try the next cycle.

I don't know much about the laproscopy and I'd definitely be asking lots of questions -- why, no seriously WHY, what will this accomplish, is there another way, when can I get it, how long for results, and if I need this then why do you say its ok to ttc? Just alllll the questions. I wish I'd asked more before my polyp removal, just because later I ttc'd and have, of course, had 3 losses...so I hate not having asked more about what was going on inside there!

I did a self post about my HSG yesterday, I can't believe it is potentially abnormal. In terms of the polyp they found, Google was reassuring and in terms of the dye pooling at the end of my right tube, Google was a scary devil.

How can I have damage? My whole life I've had normal periods, on BC for 9 years and then an IUD. No STIs other than HPV which was promptly found and treated. Never any cysts or extremely painful periods - at least I thought they were normal amounts of pain. What if they open me up and I'm full of inflammation and scarring? My bloodwork indicates inflammation somewhere in my body. I'm still in shock that they found not one, but two abnormalities. I thought it'd be clear. The good news is my left tube is perfect and dye spilled out like it's supposed to. But how do you prevent ovulation and possible ectopics if you have one shitty tube? I'm trying not to freak out - I know I still need to talk to the doctor about the specifics of what he found and what it means for moving forward. I'm just so upset, yet again, that something could be wrong and I don't know where this road will lead.

We can do absolutely nothing to determine whether our next BFP is going to work out. It's the scariest thing in the world.

There are SO many options. Like you, I have just began the figuring-out-what-could-be-wrong process after 2 losses. It's a weird, in-between place to be. Not 3 losses so it isn't considered ""recurrent loss"" but 2 is enough to worry that it will never happen. My advice is get the blood testing and do whatever tests your doctor recommends and will make you feel better. People in my life made it out like I was jumping the gun for demanding answers after 2 losses...I was told to calm down and relax, all that nonsense.

Because loss is relatively common, it does make sense that they want you to keep trying for a while before seeking answers.

Ugh I just went through this a month ago!  I've got a 2 year old so I wasn't even worried about this test, figuring my uterus isn't the prob, just checking things off the list.  But they also found something in there; I bawled on the table as I thought we'd be getting the all clear that day.  Anyways, I'm having surgical hysteroscopy to check it out/remove whatever it is- probably scarred over miscarriage tissue or something.  I've had 3 d and c's for 2 losses in the past year.  I will warn that my RE thinks this caused the second loss because of how that pregnancy progressed, so you may want a second opinion about the just trying and seeing thing.  I will also say I got very different advice during the procedure as compared to a follow up appointment afterwards, so he may not have been fully concentrating on what he was saying- I know I was firing off questions while he was up in my vagina  which was probably not ideal- got a better picture of things at another appointment.  

Anyways, sounds like we are in same boat and my treatment plan is surgical hysteroscopy (I will be fully under and it's in a hospital but is not laparoscopy) followed by a ballon Catheter for 5 days to prevent re-scarring, followed by estrogen for 30 days.  Then they'll check my lining, if optimal I'm good to go, if not more estrogen.  Hope that's helpful!  Another user wrote a helpful post for me so if you search for my intro post then you can follow her posts.  

Finally, not sure if you are frustrated by the timing, I was, especially when I found out I had to wait 7 weeks for the OR.  However, I never wouldve taken a break from Ttc without being forced to, and aside from a few hard days like when I'm clearly ovulating, the break has done wonders for my mind, marriage, and body.

Hi, I'm sorry for your losses, that's so hard. Thought I'd chime in since my losses were caused by Antiphospholipid syndrome, and you are looking for some positive stories or encouragement. I understand feeling like it won't ever happen. Until I bring a baby home I don't think I'll believe it either, it does seem so far away and impossible when even being pregnant isn't a given that a baby will come home to a loss parent.

My son was stillborn, his placenta was full of blood clots that killed off his nutrition and oxygen supply and he passed away at 24 weeks. His autopsy results took 12 weeks to come back, after which I was tested for APS. Between my son dying and getting the diagnosis I'd lost another two pregnancies, this time very early.

APS, is one of those things that needs early intervention. Because the placenta can fail right from the outset with the disorder, the clots prevent healthy implantation and blood supply to the placenta. My doctor said that's why my earlier losses likely happened and that James, our son, was lucky to make it as far as he did. I'm emphasising how important early and thorough intervention is here because once the placenta has compromised blood flow there's little to nothing that can be done to fix the problem. Aspirin in my opinion is not enough for APS, and I'd definitely not feel safe taking just aspirin, I also take daily blood thinning injections called clexane in the UK or lovenox in the USA. 

So far this all sounds so very scary and negative, but I wanted to let you know that the treatment is very effective. I started aspirin while ttc and added clexane daily after ovulation (although some doctors only allow from the positive pregnancy test, my history of very early as well as late loss needed earlier intervention). I have a healthy little boy growing away just now, and so far everything looks perfect. Excellent blood flow, fluids, he's slightly ahead of his dates already.

I'm hoping you don't have this clotting disorder but I just wanted you to know you're not alone and if you do turn out to have it, it's not the end of the road.

<p>Hi, I&#39;m sorry for your losses, that&#39;s so hard. Thought I&#39;d chime in since my losses were caused by Antiphospholipid syndrome, and you are looking for some positive stories or encouragement. I understand feeling like it won&#39;t ever happen. Until I bring a baby home I don&#39;t think I&#39;ll believe it either, it does seem so far away and impossible when even being pregnant isn&#39;t a given that a baby will come home to a loss parent.</p>

<p>My son was stillborn, his placenta was full of blood clots that killed off his nutrition and oxygen supply and he passed away at 24 weeks. His autopsy results took 12 weeks to come back, after which I was tested for APS. Between my son dying and getting the diagnosis I&#39;d lost another two pregnancies, this time very early.</p>

<p>APS, is one of those things that needs early intervention. Because the placenta can fail right from the outset with the disorder, the clots prevent healthy implantation and blood supply to the placenta. My doctor said that&#39;s why my earlier losses likely happened and that James, our son, was lucky to make it as far as he did. I&#39;m emphasising how important early and thorough intervention is here because once the placenta has compromised blood flow there&#39;s little to nothing that can be done to fix the problem. Aspirin in my opinion is not enough for APS, and I&#39;d definitely not feel safe taking just aspirin, I also take daily blood thinning injections called clexane in the UK or lovenox in the USA. </p>

<p>So far this all sounds so very scary and negative, but I wanted to let you know that the treatment is very effective. I started aspirin while ttc and added clexane daily after ovulation (although some doctors only allow from the positive pregnancy test, my history of very early as well as late loss needed earlier intervention). I have a healthy little boy growing away just now, and so far everything looks perfect. Excellent blood flow, fluids, he&#39;s slightly ahead of his dates already. I couldn&#39;t have imagined this back when my first loss happened. But any sort of future planning was impossible back, I had to just focus on each hour as it came, and then each day. Still do. </p>

I'd really push to get yourself tested - studies have shown that cause for losses is as likely to be found after 2 losses as after 3, so why endure another loss if you can get the recurrent loss panel done? Just be prepared that about half of all couples with RPL (recurrent pregnancy loss) have no diagnosed cause.

Also, my MFM told me the treatment for antiphospholipid is injectable blood thinner (and the only cause for losses that he gives heparin for). I was tested after my later loss for it and really hoped it would be the cause, to be honest! I wanted answers. 

As for me, I have a little hope for you - I had two losses in a row (April and July as well, in 2013 - though the July one got dragged out when my body retained some of the tissue and my HCG levels didn't drop to 0). That September, they ran the RPL panel and came back with no cause. I was really crushed - I wanted answers and a path of treatment and reassurance it wouldn't happen again! 

A few weeks later, I found out I was pregnant for the 3rd time in 2013 - my OB prescribed progesterone suppositories as the can't help, might hurt measure and I took baby aspirin (no one told me to). In June of 2014, I had a baby boy! I really never believed I'd get lucky enough to have a baby after those losses. I tell him all the time what a little miracle he is. <3  I won't lie, though - my pregnancy with him was SUPER anxious. I journaled and posted often in an online community for pregnancy after loss and probably talked my husband's ear off about how sure I was that this baby was going to be my third miscarriage. 

Anyway, I'm rambling - but I want to give you a huge and lots of love and encouragement. <3

Ever. 

We also painted the nursery today (in the freaking heat). And we are loving it so much! It looks more blue than green in the picture, but it's a minty type of colour. 

Little girl is moving along just fine and we are discussing the anatomy scan tomorrow at the midwifes office. Also listening to the heartbeat again. Yesterday my husband couldn't find our girls heartbeat with the Doppler and I hadn't felt her move all day. Put on some of her favorite music and felt her kicking again after about 10 minutes!

We are having some trouble with picking names though. Top 2 are Nikkie and Isa (pronounced Eesah, it's pretty popular in holland and comes from Elisabeth). Husband is leaning more towards Nikkie and I am leaning more to Isa..

I read another post on this thread about a bad scan at 12 weeks. I am heading towards our 12 week scan, and I'm trying not to think about my 12 week scan for our last babe.


I went to the 12 week ultrasound for last babe (Baby #5 and MC #3) at *Radiology place* and my husband wasn't there yet. They took me in ten minutes early to get started before my husband arrived. They gelled me up, had a look and the tech told me there was no heartbeat. Just like that.


I'm sorry. What?


He handed me tissues, and I, ever practical and full of water, was busting for the toilet so went to sort that out.


While I was peeing, my husband turned up, and while I was out of the room, the tech told him the baby had died.


I was fucking furious.


When my doctor asked where I wanted to have my 12 week scan for this, I said, not at *Radiology place* for that very reason. Also because the tech who did my dating scan took relish in stabbing my cervix when she did an internal. I'd only had an internal three weeks earlier before I ""knew"" I was pregnant again, and I'd never have even known what she was doing she was so gentle.


Anyway, thats my story about a disastrous scan. Don't feel alone. Sometimes ""professionals"" totally screw up their interactions with patient and they need to be held accountable.

Hello guys!  Sorry I've been MIA.  My parents had been in town for the past three weeks due to a child care snafu, and the weekend was very busy.

A lot has happened!  My NIPT results came back, and everything is normal (yay! the most important news!), and we found out we are expecting another boy!  Initially it felt a bit odd because I had been thinking about girl names (we already had a boy name picked out), but I am really looking forward to my son bonding with a brother.  I hope they will be close!

On Thursday I was very nervous, because I was careless and got too hot at an outdoor fair.  I sat and put ice on my neck and turned the air conditioner on high in my face, and I was terrified for my little boy.

But a few days later, on Saturday, I felt him moving!  Still not consistently.  But it is reassuring when it happens.  Trying not to think about it too much.

Yesterday I went to see some friends who had moved out of state.  A visit with them unfortunately led to my last miscarriage, because we were both exposed to HFMD (though she did not lose her baby, and I did).  So even though that had nothing to do with them, I still felt a little anxious yesterday.  Silly.

And my husband has been a bit under the weather after cleaning an attic with bat guano at work.  Yesterday we were intimate, and today I woke up thinking, what if he has some bat-bourne illness instead of an allergic reaction like I had assumed??  So cue googling like a crazy person, to discover that even if he did have something, it would likely be histoplasmosis, which does not spread from person-to-person transmission.

I felt the tiniest twinge of excitement when the result popped up, but since then...nothing. 

I called my mom and told her, but decided I'm not telling anyone else for a while. I told my mom maybe I will tell people in 6 months, haha.

That said, if anyone wants the rest of my wondfos, let me know. I have at least 20, I think, including ~3 HPTs. I can get to the post office tomorrow, so first one to let me know gets them.

My anxiety has been through the roof building up to this, it's been horrible. I had a dream last night that I couldn't find the heartbeat on the doppler, and it was so real that it actually took me a couple of minutes after waking up to realise it was just a dream. Obviously, used the doppler first thing and did find the heartbeat.

I got really upset yesterday thinking about the first baby and the first scan. I asked my husband if he ever thinks about it (the bad scan) and he said no, but I think about it all the time. The image of my poor perfect little baby lying there completely still is almost always on my mind.

My anxiety has been through the roof building up to this, it&#39;s been horrible. I had a dream last night that I couldn&#39;t find the heartbeat on the doppler, and it was so real that it actually took me a couple of minutes after waking up to realise it was just a dream. Obviously, used the doppler first thing and did find the heartbeat.</p>

<p>I got really upset yesterday thinking about the first baby and the first scan. I asked my husband if he ever thinks about it (the bad scan) and he said no, but I think about it all the time. The image of my poor perfect little baby lying there completely still is almost always on my mind. I suppose I&#39;m glad that my husband doesn&#39;t have to deal with that, but I am a little surprised that he doesn&#39;t think about it at all.</p>

I'm hoping I can swing a note from my OB recommending I start leave at 36 weeks so I won't be alone and super pregnant up to my due date. If we get that far...

We always love the fertile week, but hate the TWW since we were born symptom spotters, over-encouraged each other for a while with it only to find ourselves tearing up when my period came. 

Meanwhile, I went to acupuncture for the first time yesterday! Our session lasted for two hours - the first hour he just wanted to go through my entire health information form he had me fill out, but we read it together. At one point he said, ""I'm sorry this visit is so long, but it's important - our future ones with treatment only will be about 45-60 minutes.""

And I just said: ""Please don't feel like you ever have to apologize for wanting to take the time to get to know your patients. You know more about me and my entire medical history than my ob/gyn and primary care doctor in my HMO in the last year has ever asked about!""

16 hours later I feel great although I don't know how much I can attribute that to the treatment or the herbs that the doctor recommended and I started taking last night. A part of me feels like it was relief at having a medical practitioner who wanted to spend time to understand my body, but also how I'm relating to it psychologically during all this. But so far I'm liking the outlook I have after the appointment. 

The research I've read showed that acupuncture supported higher successful pregnancy rates with IVF so, even though I'm not trying IVF (at least not yet, we're thinking about it and trying to budget to see if it's even possible), I'm hopeful it will support fertilization and conception for a non-IVFer like myself.

At one point he said, &quot;I&#39;m sorry this visit is so long, but it&#39;s important - our future ones with treatment only will be about 45-60 minutes.&quot;</p>

<p>And I just said: &quot;Please don&#39;t feel like you ever have to apologize for wanting to take the time to get to know your patients. You know more about me and my entire medical history than my ob/gyn and primary care doctor in my HMO in the last year has ever asked about!&quot;</p>

<p>16 hours later I feel great although I don&#39;t know how much I can attribute that to the treatment or the herbs that the doctor recommended and I started taking last night. A part of me feels like it was relief at having a medical practitioner who wanted to spend time to understand my body, but also how I&#39;m relating to it psychologically during all this. But so far I&#39;m liking the outlook I have after the appointment. </p>

<p>The research I&#39;ve read showed that acupuncture supported higher successful pregnancy rates with IVF so, even though I&#39;m not trying IVF (at least not yet, we&#39;re thinking about it and trying to budget to see if it&#39;s even possible), I&#39;m hopeful it will support fertilization and conception for a non-IVFer like myself. </p>

UGH. Super major cramps. Rawr. I start Femara tomorrow!

As a followup to my PT ""fun""....I thought it wasn't I going to have a chance to talk to him at PT yesterday… Because there were a lot of people around.  But when I was leaving everybody had cleared out for a birthday celebration. So I told him that I really wanted to congratulate him on the baby… And that the conversation on Tuesday really threw me for loop because I've had three miscarriages. I told him that I felt a little awkward about it and didn't know what to say… so I didn't say anything. But I really am happy for him.  He thanked me told me he hadn't really noticed...And was sorry that he didn't notice.  Said ""As your PT I SHOULD notice changes in you while you're here!""  And then...told me about some of their struggles getting pregnant!!

At least he can understand some part of it… Not the loss but the infertility feelings are similar. And the desire for and lack of baby. The depression that comes with that. Etc... So I told him I'd just appreciate no baby talk unless I ask him -- I'm there 2 hours a week, he can talk about it plenty of other times.

Then I had my local support group last night, too. And it was great. I got out some feelings...and also was able to talk to some girls about their feelings of this topic being taboo and all their pregnant friends. I shared how I handle that and they were all loving it. I even invited a couple of them to join TTCAL and they sounded so interested. One lady had a TFMR and has struggled A LOT -- hasn't even told her family due to their reactions to the thought of termination. And has nobody in her life who terminated to relate to her. Another just found out she's 5 weeks pregnant after 3 miscarriages and is struggling. So I hope they will join and get some support. Our local group only meets once a MONTH so that's tough.

This place is used to women who have had losses and it&#39;s sort of &quot;anything goes&quot; so my husband was able to take video too. They warned us that we may not see a heartbeat this early, but we saw the little flicker :) It was so amazing to see the heartbeat. They were so compassionate and sweet. We scheduled my cerclage for 10/28 and my 9 week and 12 week appointments are all set. Trying to stay calm and zen.</p>

So my guess is that it is included. 

MTHFR isn't just one pair of nucleotides, it's a section of a chromosome. What we're all referring to is a SNP (single nucleotide polymorphism, pronounced ""snip""), which is a single nucleotide that has a mutation. Because DNA is double stranded, you can have the mutation on both strands (homozygous), just one (heterozygous), or neither. The difference between a gene and a SNP is like the difference between a city and a specific address. 

Here's a link to the SNP in question:

If you have any other questions feel free to ask. The caveat is that while I have a basic understanding of genetics and molecular biology, I don't really know a damn thing about this on a medical level other than what I can piece together from journal articles. 

Edit: I feel like I should also point out that having this mutation doesn't necessarily mean you'll have any problems. Genetics has a few hard and fast guarantees, but this isn't one of them. Most of it is nebulous as fuck and based on correlations rather than causation. It's a big, big, big genome, and we don't know much. Not to mention that most genetic issues aren't caused by one single gene, but possibly an assortment of genes, sometimes even on different chromosomes. Then there are issues that maybe, possibly are caused not by mutations but methylation of certain base pairs (epigenetics). They're working on it, but the work is really just beginning. 

For instance, there are 3 BILLION base pairs on the genome and we're specifically talking about ONE base pair here. This isn't a magic bullet or anything.

Is it going to be your OBGYN doing the surgery or a specialty GYN surgeon? The doc who performed my hysteroscopy was the head of gynecological microsurgery of my hospital, so I wasn't too concerned about her skill level! I'd ask questions about how often they have performed the hysteroscopy, what their re-scarring rate is, and more detailed questions about the type of procedure (i.e. in-office vs. under anesthesia). 

From my perspective and what I've heard from others online, most people get a hysteroscopy under anesthesia and get a catheter. They also get estrogen supplements afterwards. My medical group typically doesn't do these things. I had in office and no catheter. I get migraine with aura so cannot take estrogen afterwards. After the 1st hysteroscopy, when the RE thought he saw scarring again on ultrasound, they wanted to use a catheter after the second procedure. I really didn't want to because I am prone to infection and thought that risk would be higher than any benefit the catheter would provide. I read a ton of medical journal articles (again, on the Yahoo group) about catheters and they do seem to help. However, since they did not find repeat scarring on the second time around, they did not think it was worth the infection risk to have the catheter. My personal feeling (not medical advice) is that if your scarring in the first place is minimal, a catheter isn't probably necessary. 

I did take Wobenzyme after the first procedure with the intention of preventing scarring. Also went to my fertility acupuncturist frequently and did castor oil packs. Lots of info about this ..... wait for it ... in the Yahoo group! :)

I was really freaked out before the first time with the same concerns as you. It was helpful for me to do all the research I could so I could be informed and empowered to make sure that this was the right step for me. If after doing research and talking to your doctor, you don't feel like he is experienced enough in this, you might want to consider one of the ""A-lister"" docs, found on the yahoo group. There are also B and C listers, all which come recommended by ladies in the group, and have proven levels of expertise.

I realized repeating my problems every day was too much for me and was doing more harm than good. But I'm struggling today and I think I need this.

I'm 26+2 today and 18 hours into a 48 hour heart monitor study. I have mentioned before an OB resident discovered I had a heart murmur, and I've been battling high blood pressure the whole time. I was monitoring at home when it detected an irregular heartbeat. Only once. But I guess everything combined (plus shortness of breath and my family history) made my OB decide to refer me to a cardiologist. 

I went yesterday and got an EKG done which is what my OB ordered. I realized the Dr never told me the results of it, although I saw him look at the print out. He confirmed I had a slight murmur and asked if I've felt heart palpitations. I said yes, I'd been noticing it mostly the week I was sick and my husband and I had looked it up and it was normal in pregnancy, as are most of my symptoms. But he couldn't say unless we did more tests. He was interested in the palpitations but I couldn't tell him more because I hadn't been tracking it.

I was immediately sent to get an echo cardiogram, which is an ultrasound of the heart. The tech said she didn't see anything obviously wrong but the doctor would have to look at it. Although it makes me feel better because she'd been doing this for 15 years. Then I was whisked away to get a heart monitor put on to try and catch some palpations. The tape hurts! I'm so uncomfortable with this.

I didn't realize this was all happening the same day. I have to wear this for two days and can't shower. I was supposed to wash my hair! Now I have to finagle how to do that without getting wet, which sounds great while pregnant. And my old friend is coming into town tonight through the weekend so he'll probably notice it and I'll have to explain. And I'm worried someone at work will notice.

I'm scared they will find something wrong as both my dad and his dad were killed by heart attacks and I'm not in good physical shape. Although part of me would like some explanation as to why I've been feeling like I am. Maybe I'm just a wuss and this is pregnancy.

On top of that, my husband is still at the company that laid him off. He's making less right now, but over the year he has the potential to make more than he was. But he has been involved with talking to another small company and they seen nice, I'm just worried about if he can make enough there.

AND my MIL blew up on my husband and she isn't speaking to us (us lol she hardly ever talked to me anyways). You can find a post about this in justnomil. We asked her to do family therapy with us and she said no so we're pretty much done with her until she agrees. Although I'm sure dh will throw that plan out the window once baby is here. She called DH last night after not hearing from her for a week. He didn't answer and she didn't leave a message. So idk what she had to say.

Oh and I have some kind of cyst or abscess on my leg near my bikini area that burst like 5 days ago and is still leaking. So I have to struggle once or twice a day to bend over my bump and get a bandaid on it so I don't ruin my pants.

I'm just so overwhelmed and everything makes me tired. My feet have started to swell and I can feel the tightness when I move them. I'm hating my body right now. I feel like baby isn't kicking as much, although she may be in a different position and kicking down. I just want something to go right soon!

But he has been involved with talking to another small company and they seen nice, I&#39;m just worried about if he can make enough there.</p>

<p>AND my MIL blew up on my husband and she isn&#39;t speaking to us (us lol she hardly ever talked to me anyways). You can find a post about this in justnomil. We asked her to do family therapy with us and she said no so we&#39;re pretty much done with her until she agrees. Although I&#39;m sure dh will throw that plan out the window once baby is here. She called DH last night after not hearing from her for a week. He didn&#39;t answer and she didn&#39;t leave a message. So idk what she had to say.</p>

<p>Oh and I have some kind of cyst or abscess on my leg near my bikini area that burst like 5 days ago and is still leaking. So I have to struggle once or twice a day to bend over my bump and get a bandaid on it so I don&#39;t ruin my pants.</p>

<p>I&#39;m just so overwhelmed and everything makes me tired. My feet have started to swell and I can feel the tightness when I move them. I&#39;m hating my body right now. I feel like baby isn&#39;t kicking as much, although she may be in a different position and kicking down. I just want something to go right soon! I want to fast forward to baby being here.</p>

I had a large band of scar tissue that was removed, as well as a truckload of polyps the first time around. Healed well but doc thought he saw scarring on follow up ultrasound, so did another hysteroscopy, this time taking progesterone for a bit for clearer visibility. Surgeon ended up removing a few more polyps as well as retained pregnancy tissue. Next time up to bat, I was pregnant. Currently 13 weeks. I really believe the polyps were causing the losses (always missed miscarriages at 6.5 weeks, but identified weeks later), as they were right at the exit of my tubes, and the egg was likely implanting there and not getting enough nourishment.

From my own experience, I would highly recommend the hysteroscopies, so you can get, in the words of my RE, a ""pristine uterus.""

I also HIGHLY recommend the Asherman's group on Yahoo. There is a wealth of information, data, and studies. Join the Asherman's group on FB for great anecdotal information from women with uterine scar tissue. It is a small but active community. The biggest piece of advice is to make sure that your surgeon is very experienced in dealing with Asherman's (aka any inter uterine scarring/adhesions) because there can be a risk of damage in the hands of an unskilled practitioner.

There's been some thoughts in my head that I don't think I could verbalize to anyone, but maybe some of you guys will understand. I think everyone understands that I lost a baby and that is sad.

I took misoprostol to induce a miscarriage. I was 8 weeks along but baby had stopped growing at about 5 weeks 6 days and had no heartbeat. I, too, have a two year old (not quite two at that time) and I didn't want a D&C because I wasn't sure how to juggle her and going to the hospital (we really don't have anyone to watch her as we're new to the area and I can't drive so DH would have to take me to the hospital).

It took about six hours for the misoprostol to kick in for me. During that time, I felt physically fine.  When it did kick it, I had diarrhea with bad intestinal cramping, so I didn't really feel the miscarriage itself.  

For after, I bled a lot that day/night and then had bleeding much like a regular period for a week and then light bleeding/spotting for several more days.  Physically, I could have done just about anything during that time - I did get up the next morning and go out to feed horses.  

Emotionally, it was harder.  I work from home, so I did work but didn't do my best work. I didn't want to work or do much of anything.

Your loss is nothing compared to what others have gone through in terms of the years and pains in trying to conceive - stop being fatalistic it's not good for you! in yet another moment). 

Honor your fears and worries when you have them since they really won't go away if you ignore them - talk or write them out in a journal or on here and they feel less scary or you can at least see how others share them. Focus on your strengths and what you value in life already. 

Try not to be hard on your body especially (I'm still working at this one). Know that your period cycles will probably be different and incredibly confusing. For me my first period wasn't tough but then the second one was a killer - I had all these (what I thought were) pregnancy symptoms instead of PMS symptoms because my body had somehow rewired the way it manifests progesterone in my system. Gone were my typical PMS sore boobs and all of a sudden I had veiny boobs with montgomery's glands popping out all over. My first period felt ""normal,"" my second periods PMS lead-up was one of the most horrible on earth with intense cramping and also weird awful discharge, my third period came after a 24 day cycle (the shortest ever in my life) after two 31-day cycles (the longest I had ever had in my life) and lasted for almost a week!

My loss was at 9 weeks but the baby had passed 2 weeks earlier. Because my body was showing no signs of passing the pregnancy on its own (my cervix was completely closed) we skipped the cytotec. My dr told me that contracting against a closed cervix would be very painful and I would most likely end up with a D&C anyways. We found out on Friday and opted to wait until the next week for the surgery to be sure that my body wouldn't take care of it on its own. It didn't, and my surgery was on Tuesday. I took the whole week off. I felt ok afterwards just disoriented and tired. I had lunch and went home for a nap. It took about a day before I was comfortable driving. The bleeding was annoying but not as bad as I expected. It was never heavier than my period and a normal pad handled it fine. I used the always infinity ones because they were the most comfortable and thinnest. The bleeding was very similar to lochia after childbirth, it just didn't last as long and wasn't quite as heavy. I had some light cramping off and on for a couple of days. I was very, very tired from the emotion and stress. 

Physically, I found a heating pad to be comforting and helpful with even light cramping and elastic waist sweatpants, Ben & Jerry's, cheezits, wine, and mindless, non-triggering Netflix (I watched Fuller House of all things) helped a lot.  

Going back to work afterwards was HARD. I had a lot of trouble focusing and caring about the work that I was doing.

Be gentle on yourself. My emotions after the D&C were surprising in a lot of ways and I felt a lot more guilt and loneliness than I would have expected.

That being said, we were left with the same decision to make. I did a lot of research, and spoke with my doctor who was very informative about both sides. Either way, there's going to be some psychological issues to deal with afterwards, but she said she's noticed a lot of patients that decide to go the at home route have a more difficult time ""moving on"" (I don't think anyone really moves on from this kind of an experience, but I'm using that phrase for lack of a better one). A lot of times the home becomes connected to the place where you lost your child, which, for some people, is near impossible to move on from. 

I had some medical issues going on that needed to be addressed, which is why I ended up having to terminate. I will say that I was already taking narcotics for said medical issue, so my experience might be different than others. 

In terms of pain-I had hardly any. A bit of cramping afterward but nothing worse than a normal period. Beforehand, I remember crying in the ""holding area"" where they put you to get the IV started. I remember the nurse asking if I was crying because I was scared of the procedure, or crying because of the loss. I responded ""both"". She promised to take care of me in terms of the procedure, and she did. 

When they took me back into the procedure room, my doctor came in and I was still pretty upset. The nurse told me she was about to give me some meds, I turned to her and asked if I would remember the procedure. Her response was ""it's my job to make sure you don't"". That's the last thing I remember.  I woke up in a recovery area with a little cramping, but was able to walk out of there with my spouse within the hour. 

I will admit I do feel some guilt for ""not remembering"". I went through a while there where I felt like I took the easy way out, that maybe I should have had a harder experience in terms of the procedure itself. Those are all psych issues that I have been, and am still working through. 

Choose whatever route is best for you. If you decide to go the D&C route, make sure it's at a place you trust. (They did it at my obgyns office-I had no idea they did those there until I was in this situation). 

Again I'm so sorry you're in this situation. I had mine almost two months ago and still have some ""bad days"", but I think that's ok. If you have any other questions about the procedure or anything else, I'm more than happy to answer. Sending huge hugs to you during such a difficult time. Hang in there, you're not alone.

Being here has helped me immensely in my process, and I hope you find the same solace. 

As cliche as it sounds, time has helped me. I'm on my first new cycle after my D&C (July 29), in the TTC window now. My first period after my D&C was long, and definitely different. Around four weeks after the procedure I had around five days of spotting and light bleeding but no cramps or other symptoms, then on day six came the heavy bleeding and cramps. It was close to 11 days total of bleeding. I've read that the first period after a miscarriage/D&C can be drastically different than your normal ones, and lots of women seemed to say that first period after was way worse - more cramps, heavier bleeding, etc. 

As time goes on, you'll know what's best for you. We didn't exactly try that first cycle immediately after the D&C, but didn't prevent anything either. I think getting pregnant that first cycle would have made me worry more for some reason. Now I know when my period was, etc, so I feel ready to try. I'm using OPKs and temping this cycle, something I've never done before either, so it's all a learning process. I've had lots of questions and this sub has always helped me find the right answers while being supportive and nurturing. It's really fantastic. 

As for the worry... I just try to take it one day at a time. There is nothing - *nothing* - you could have done to prevent what happened. That remains true going forward. I try to remind myself that, even though it's tough. I'm a chronic worrier. The good thing is, there's a whole ""alumni"" subset of women in this group, to be a part of once you become pregnant again. I choose to stay here as opposed to TFAB, which is not my cup of tea support-wise. That's just me. 

Try to let yourself feel what you want to feel. It took me awhile of ups and downs to be ready to try again. Some days were just awful, the sadness and emotions that snuck up out of nowhere. Other days I felt amazing, but then felt guilty for feeling amazing. Emotions are fickle. Just let yourself feel. Know you're not alone. Miscarriages happen to *A LOT* of women. Most of those women go on to have completely healthy pregnancies. Talk when you feel like talking, process your emotions, and you'll know when it's ready to try again.

Today is my first consultation with the midwife and I can't help but feel that this is going to be a giant waste of their time. Even though today is really just more of an intake to see if I would even be a good fit and if we like the staff.

The past few days I have just had the overwhelming sense that there is no baby for me at the end of this pregnancy. I got my BFP super early (9 DPO), and my symptoms were fairly strong around the time I would have expected my period: incredibly sore boobs, nausea, heartburn, some very mild cramping, and food aversions/cravings with constant hunger. After a few days of that the heartburn died down, my boobs became slightly less tender, but the nausea and picked up and crushing fatigue joined the party. A few more days, and then everything just started to fade. Symptoms have still been around but have just been getting milder and milder each day. Even my insomnia seems to be clearing up. Woke up today and I just don't feel pregnant. Boobs feel normal, slept in later than I have in weeks, no wake-up nausea.

I know it's normal for symptoms to come and go, but this is more like came and gone. I also know it's normal to not have ANY symptoms, especially this early, but I had symptoms and now I don't. I keep telling myself I have no bleeding or painful cramping, but I never had either with my MMC.

I am going to request a referral for an early ultrasound, but I'd like to wait until 8 weeks when things are more definitive. So I guess I've got 2.5 more weeks of this weird ""am I really pregnant?"" Until I can get a clearer answer, as I'm currently only 5w+3.

Looks like we've got another slow rise on our hands, folks! We hope you've enjoyed your stay in Relative Sanity Valley, because the slow descent into Madness will be taking place in about 5 days and is scheduled to last for at least a week. 

I think I did an ovulate. I made the sperms happen. Please be for wishing me a baby. Thx. 2dpo today, I think. Any cycle buddies?

Today, on the TTC front, I'll be meeting with the nice gyno at my school to see if she can either A) take control of my care or B) refer me to someone who can, because I'm so so so so so so reticent to go back to my current gyno.

I'm like... uuugh! I paid for that out of my own pocket! Just tell me! Because he doesn't have provincial insurance, they couldn't even put the results online. >:(  

Does anyone else give up and not try to fuck on O+1? I was thinking about it last night but I just could not be bothered. And then I just felt shitty about myself. We got O-1 and O-3, and O-5, so I'm happy with that. 

Also, ovulation was *mad painful* this month. I didn't have any mittelschmerz last month, but this month... whew. I felt it mostly on the right (the tubeless side), so I'm already feeling like my chances aren't awesome.

That turned into a really fun conversation as I'm holding a positive ovulation stick in my hand and insisting that we come to an agreement within the next 12 hours. 

Based on the research we both did, we came to the conclusion that it's best to avoid getting pregnant before the first period because it's very difficult to determine the due date. This seemed like an insignificant concern until we realized that the date is also used to determine if the baby is developing on schedule, and that for a couple who's experienced a miscarriage this adds a seemingly unnecessary level of stress to the equation. 

We also learned that it's not as big of a deal to get pregnant immediately if there are no complications. I was lucky to pass everything naturally and the follow up instructions consisted of a recommendation to take iron pills. 

As is expected, every single case is different and what's right for one woman may not be right for another. 

Beyond that, we found very little research regarding length of time after miscarriage to impregnation and the correlation with live births. The general consensus seems to be to wait a couple of months based on the understanding that being cautious is generally advised in most aspects of life. 

We went for it. I totally freaked out immediately afterwards. Based on my current mental state, we probably should have waited a cycle just to make sure that my depression is back under control. A little bit late for that now, as I'm 3 DPO. 

tl;dr If there weren't any complications, you're probably fine. If it's before your first period, it's way helpful to know when you ovulated. Lastly, physiological health isn't everything. Make sure you're in a good place mentally. Those MC hormones are a bitch.

I TFMR for DiGeorge Syndrome, which is nearly as common as Down Syndrome (1 in 1000-2000) but hardly anyone hears about it.  It is caused by a tiny missing piece of chromosome 22 and comes with a bleak prognosis that includes as many as 200 different physical and mental health conditions.

We had NIPT at 10 weeks, which supposedly tested for the chromosome 22 micro deletion / DiGeorge syndrome, and it was negative.  The NIPT did not detect it, NIPT is just not accurate enough.  Our anatomy ultrasound at 20+3 weeks found several birth defects including a heart defect, and we had an amnio the next day.  We did not get the amnio results to proceed with the termination until almost 24 weeks.  Termination after 20 weeks is not even legally allowed in many states, and while it is legal where we live, our hospital's ethics policies do not allow termination after 24 weeks regardless of the law.  If we had gotten amnio results 2 days later than we did, we would have had to seek out one of the few clinics in the entire US that terminate later than 24 weeks.  

Terminating that late in the pregnancy definitely contributed to the traumatic nature of the whole ordeal.  I mentioned the legal aspects, but much worse were the emotional ramifications.

I am hoping to be pregnant again very soon.  Our chances of this genetic error happening again are very low --  the same as the general population, the same as the chances were in the first place, about 1 in 1000-2000.  But if we were unlucky once, we could be so again.   Anyone could be.  I hate to be the pessimist, but this is the reality we were and are faced with.

I spoke with my OB about what the plan would be if we get pregnant again.  She said that of course our chances of this happening twice are very low.  Logically in my mind I agree.  But emotionally, now that I know that I would terminate a pregnancy with a very poor prognosis, my preference is to know sooner than later.  And I think I will be so anxious until we know that the baby is healthy, that I will opt to have the CVS.  

My OB mentioned that the risk of miscarriage is actually lower than what is traditionally quoted.  When performed using modern ultrasound imaging by an experienced doctor, the risk is closer to 1 in 500 vs. the 1 in 100 that we are usually told.  The miscarriage risk for an amnio is closer to 1 in 1000-1600.  CVS can be done at 12ish weeks, and amnio as early as 15 weeks.

What my OB, my husband, and I decided is that we would play it by ear and gauge our anxiety level and weigh it against the risks to the pregnancy posed by the invasive testing.  At this point I lean toward the CVS.  I just can't stand the idea of terminating another pregnancy at 24 weeks along.  I can't wait until the 20-week anatomy scan, and the 3-week wait for amnio results if the scan shows abnormalities.  Those 3 weeks after we found all the birth defects but before we had the amnio results, while my belly got bigger and bigger, while baby I loved was kicking away, and strangers at the grocery store wanted to chat about my pregnancy while we didn't know what our very sick baby's fate was-- they were the worst 22 days of my entire life.

As for my personal experience, there was also no obvious reason my son died and the tests never answered any questions, so please be prepared to never get an answer as to why you lost your little girl. I am so sorry you are going through this. There is a chance that my son's death was caused by a circumvallate placenta, which is super rare and is even more rare that it leads to neonatal death. So, I hit the shitty jackpot, I guess.

If you are no longer bleeding, they may do a pelvic exam to ensure you don't have obvious signs of infection. I was also recommended to abstain from sex for a few weeks, and to not TTC for 4-5 months. I do believe that that's more for emotional stability rather than physical cabability, though. 

Feel free to pm me anytime. I'm so sorry you are going through this. My biggest advice, coming from 5 months later, is that your SO will cope in his own way. I thought my SO just didn't care, but he was grieving his own way and we talked about it. We're still struggling, but we're mending things.

Decided to introduce myself over here after seeing so many recommendations on r/cautiousBB. After reading the rules I wasn't sure if a separate intro post would be in violation, so just putting this here. 

Currently 5w+1. My first and only other pregnancy ended when it was discovered I had had a missed miscarriage at 12 weeks. It's was the day before my birthday and we had planned on our public announcement then. Two rounds of misoprostol still couldn't induce the expulsion, so I ended up needing a D&C. My partner (at the time) and I went back to preventing, and then about 2 years later I had a life-threatening ovarian rupture--the ovary was saved but it's functionality was unknown. Ever since the MMC, and especially after the rupture, my cycles were wonky and all over the place. 

In July my husband and I decided to TTC, and I had been absolutely convinced for years that it would be a struggle given what the past few years had held and that I didn't even know if one of my ovaries worked. First month was a bust (our timing sucked though), but month 2 I got my BFP. After years of being convinced getting pregnant would be a struggle, I thought I would be elated it happened so soon. But I'm not. I spent the first week convinced it was going to be a CP (I even told my husband not to get his hopes up because I didn't think it would stick), and now that I'm past that stage with good line progression, I mostly just feel nothing. Like I'm just waiting for my first scan when they will tell me there's no baby or no heartbeat and I'll get to go through everything all over again. It doesn't help that my symptoms were pretty strong right around when I would have had my period, but have since become much milder (but still there). I try to remind myself that this is a new egg, with a new sperm (from an new guy), and a new chance. I check my probability of mc every day to see it tick down, which helps for a minute until I remember that last time I made it to the <2% range and a lot of good that did me.

I flipped my shit yesterday after finding out a family member had said she hopes I have a girl *so I can't pretend that this baby is my dead son*

I'm so done with everyone's opinions and judgements. Since day one, everyone raised eyebrows at how I grieved, how I coped, that I had more losses and still kept trying, judged that I didn't wait an ""appropriate"" amount of time after James died to ttc.

My sister said I wanted a bandaid baby. My Gran told me to stop ttc because it was ""too upsetting for everyone"" when I cried over my dead babies. My Step-Mom asked me if James died because I hadn't taken prenatal vitamins, and would his placenta have been ok if I'd taken them? (I did take them, that's not how IUGR works). My dad said I was ""mentally unstable"" and someone had to talk some sense into me. He also said he didn't want to be made to be ""sad and depressed by hearing about it constantly"" (I never spoke of my loss to him because he always brought it back to his feelings). My MIL sent me texts after my third loss saying ""still pregnant?"" As a way to ask me if I'd lost the baby yet. My aunt asked me while I was miscarrying if I was still having unprotected sex, because apparently being open about loss means my sex life is now everyone's business. And now someone's said they think I'm that deluded, in denial or whatever, that I couldn't have a boy without pretending that it's James.

All of this is despite the fact that I kept to myself, very few people saw my grief or came near to know how I was coping. It was pure speculation on their parts, because *they* couldn't imagine how anyone would cope losing three babies in four months. 

How insulting is it to suggest that a mother doesn't realise what she has lost? I never forgot, couldn't forget, even in my sleep I saw dead babies. Every fibre in my soul knew and felt that loss. It's a hole in my heart that will never go away. And people think I can just have another baby and carry on like James never died?

You shouldn't take folic acid after having MTX for an ectopic because it'll counteract the way the medication works and take longer for the pregnancy to resolve.

I had three ectopic pregnancies, all of which were resolved with methotrexate.  I've been down your road a few times, and it sucks.  

FYI - you do not need to wait three months to try again.  Once your HCG is at zero, it would be wise to ask for a HSG test (which hurts like a motherfucker, but is quick) to see if your tube is still patent.  If so, and if you feel mentally and emotionally ready, you can absolutely try again. If you ask why people say to wait three months, your doctor will give you two reasons, both of which are bullshit. 

 Bullshit reason 1)  MTX works by interfering with your body's ability to use folic acid, and that is what causes the deah of rapidly growing cells (like cells in a pregnancy).  Supposedly, you need time for your body's stores of folic acid to build up again.  Folic acid is a water-soluble vitamin that your body cannot ""build up stores of"" like it can with fat-soluble vitamins, and within days of hitting 0 HCG you'll be fine if you go back on prenatals.  

2) You need time to metabolize the medicine.  Also bullshit.  The half-life of methotrexate at higher doses given for autoimmune conditions like psoriasis is ten hours at the most. It should be significantly less than that for doses required to end an ectopic pregnancy. Basically, by the time your HCG reaches zero (which could be up to a few weeks from now) you will have metabolized the meds and then some.  Totally safe to try again once your next period starts after that.  My final ectopic took more than a month to resolve, and I was so emotionally drained and stressed from it that I called my doc at 4 PM on a Friday asking if a drink at happy hour was OK because I really needed one.  She was sort of taken aback that I had waited so long and informed that the meds were out of my system already, even if my HCG wasn't yet at zero, and to please have two drinks - one for me, one for her.

Really, the reason docs seem to want to make you wait is to give you time to process the loss mentally/emotionally.  But everyone does that in different ways at different rates, and many women find that the act of trying again gives them hope for the future.   My RE was firmly of the opinion, knowing me well, that there was absolutely zero reason to wait, and that my period starting again was my body's way of saying it was ready for another try at pregnancy.  

Just an FYI.  But for now...do avoid the booze (MTX does a real number on your liver), direct sunlight, and foods/vitamins with folic acid, as folic acid will counteract the MTX and make it take longer to work.  And please accept a long, long hug and sincere condolences.  ",[],,t1_d79ceox,False,0,[],False,"<div class=""md""><p>I&#39;m so sorry for your loss.  Sending a hug.  </p>

I had a baby! And he is absolutely perfect in every way. Jace Anthony arrived at 7:19 am 9/4/16 weighing in at 6 pounds 14 ounce. I started having painful inconsistent contractions three days ago. I waited it out until 11pm last night but the pain was so unbearable. When we got to L&D I was in such unbelievable pain I couldn't even think; then I find out I'm only 1.5cm dilated! I cried lol. They thought it was just a UTI. No freaking way that was from a UTI. So they made me walk around the waiting room for an hour. I could've died. But when they checked me after my walk I was up to a 3. The rest was actually pretty routine. I got a labor room, and right away I got am epidural. Bless you women who go without one..you are a stronger person than me lol. Then they broke my water. I still wasn't dilating so they started me on pitocin. At 6:30 I started feeling a lot of pressure and just knew he was about to come, but I was only 5cm. I woke dh up and he actually wanted to go get breakfast but I convinced him to wait, and the nurse was saying that it would probably be about 5 more hours. But something told me it was almost time so I called our families and told them to come down asap (while dh rolled his eyes and told me not to rush them -_-). Then all of a sudden I felt a lot of pressure and asked the nurse to check (she took her time), and there he was! The doctor and a fee nurses ran in just in time...three pushes and he came out screaming. I went from 5cm to 10cm in 30 minutes lol. I'll take it. I'm attempting to post a link with a pic

I miscarried at 7+6 on 8/9 (first pregnancy), and fortunately everything passed naturally. On 8/15, on what was supposed to be our first prenatal visit, I had an ultrasound and was told that it was roughly 95% passed, and that my endometrium was already building up nicely. When asked about when we can start trying again our doctor said vaguely, ""I won't scold you if you get pregnant before your first period or the next cycle."" When asked for further clarification she essentially said that it's kind of a crap shoot (paraphrasing) since there's not any concrete scientific evidence one way or the other. 

I've been using opks, not with the intention of trying this cycle, but just to try and get some understanding of wtf is going on with my body. I've had ewcm for a few days and the  tests started getting darker yesterday. This morning was a definite positive. 

Every single fiber of my being is telling me to give it a shot. I'm a person who is very strongly influenced by their hormones and all of mine are screaming at me to get knocked up again. Husband is incredibly cautious compared to me, and I had to talk him into doing his own independent research to see if his opinion on waiting could be swayed. It swayed. 

As I'm sitting here with my pelvis tilted upwards for the past hour (I'm aware that it's total bs, but like with all superstitious nonsense I figure it can't hurt to try), I'm wondering if this is a mistake. 

Am I crazy for trying this? It's been three and a half weeks since, it happened very early, everything passed naturally with no complications, and I haven't had a positive pregnancy test in awhile. I've been taking my prenatals and an iron supplement. 

I know that one of the issues with getting pregnant before the first period is related to not having an accurate due date and thus having issues with anxiety relating to fetal development, but that problem has been eliminated. 

I'm totally second guessing myself and really am scared that I'm setting myself up for another failure. I hope I didn't just massively fuck up.

I'd definitely consider telling him. And know that it will likely be hard for him to understand AND he won't immediately ""get"" that it means its hard for you to talk about or hear about the pregnancy. I have ""rules"" that I tell all my pregnant friends/family these days. 

* Don't contact me during work hours about anything pregnancy related (It can upset me and ruin my whole day)
* Don't send bump photos, ultrasounds, gender annoucements, etc without ASKING me if I want to see them right now (I tell them I DO want to see them but some days/hours/minutes are worse than others so I need a heads up and to be asked)
* Don't send any pregnancy related info in a GROUP email or text (It sucks to just be processing the message and then have 5 others reply with such excitement and joy...and sometimes delayed)
* If I ask you about your pregnancy/how you're feeling/etc, then I'm feeling up to talking about it and you can reply in kind...but if you go on and on and on, it will be very hard for me. (I'm only doing it because I love you and am happy for you and want to be a BIT involved, not because I feel so much better about the situation I'm in)

* Try to understand why I need this from you - I AM excited for you, but I'm hurting.

I basically send this in a lengthy email when someone announces...I gush at them a bit, congratulate, tell them I love them/am so excited for them/etc....tell them I don't want to put a damper on their happiness or ""make it about me"", but that I need some things from them if I am going to be involved at all....and that I hope they can understand...and give them those ""rules"".

Lasted maybe 45 seconds and then I went back to sleep.  Woke up around 5 and went to the bathroom.  As I came back to bed I had another cramp and just took note of the time-- 5:08.  It was at that point that I thought maybe something might be up and I couldn&#39;t fall back to sleep. I gave it 1/2 an hour and then got up and made some breakfast.  I dropped something and bent down to pick it up.  When I stood back up I got another cramp.  I looked at the clock-- 6:08.  Now sitting on a yoga ball and watching tv... This better be it, people. </p>

First of all, baby looks great. He's in the 84th percentile and moving around like crazy even though he was super stubborn about showing his face.

It's no longer on the back of his neck though, so we're hopeful that this means that it is absorbing, albeit slowly. We also think that we found the reason for the fluid. He has what looks to be a good sized hole between the lower chambers of his heart (VSD). She couldn't be 100% sure because it's so early but she seemed about 90%. It's too big to close up on its own so he will likely need surgery at some point. If we're lucky and nothing changes, we will still be able to deliver in our city and then have his surgery in a city about an hour away when he's 6-9 months old. If it gets bigger (in relation to his heart) then we will need to deliver in the other city and surgery will need to be more immediate. The heart defect increases our chances of a couple of other syndromes, one of which we are already testing for (awaiting results) and the other one I think that we will not test for. It doesn't change how we feel about him or what we would do. 

We have another ultrasound in 2 weeks to get a better look at his heart and to get the referrals that we will need to get started on a game plan for the rest of the pregnancy, birth, and surgery.

However, I know *exactly* what you mean though by stating you want to try alone. I was on fertility treatments when I was still married to my ex-husband. At the time things finally came to a head and we broke up for good, I didn't know if I was pregnant. It was a bittersweet moment of disappointment and relief when I got my period. I said to myself, ""maybe I'll just have a baby by myself!"" I felt it was what I really, truly wanted - despite being so wrecked from the breakup and impending divorce that I had to take FMLA from work for six weeks. Even though leaving him was the best decision I've ever made, it was still a loss and a difficult time. It was painful, both realizing my hopes of being a mom at that time were also ending at the same time of my relationship. So I thought to myself, ""well, I don't need HIM, I'll just have a baby and become a mom without him!"" So, I completely understand where you're coming from when you say you want to try with a donor right now. 

However, I firmly believe you'd be making a mistake by choosing to go the route of single mom right now. I'm now married with a two year old, and being a mom is by far the most difficult, thankless job I've ever had (and I'm an ER nurse). I have a happy, healthy laid-back kid, and it is still *hard* some days. I can't imagine doing this without the support and help from my husband. I don't know how single parents do it. Don't get me wrong, it's amazing and I would never change a thing about my life or my kid, but it's damn hard. Having help and support from my husband makes the good moments (which are abundant) that much better to enjoy, because we can enjoy them as a family. I'm 35 now, and had my son when I was 32. It's fine to wait. It was the best decision of my life to wait. 

I urge you to consider counseling. It helped me immensely through my breakup and divorce. And only you know what's best for your reproductive health, but I loved my IUD and would recommend it in a heartbeat. 

Stay strong, and know you're not alone.

Hi and let me start with I'm so sorry for you losses. I had an ectopic last year which they found after bleeding consistently for more than a month. My right tube just barely hung on and they removed it because it was past saving. I was very worried about conceiving after the ectopic again. The OB that did my surgery explained that the remaining tube can catch eggs from both my ovaries, and that my fertility would be up to 80% a year after the surgery. That's when the brain can fully understand what happened with missing tube. 

I was really worried though with conceiving again, very scared also. 5 cycles after the surgery I got pregnant again and had an early ultrasound at 6 weeks to see the placement of the embryo. Everything was okay but it was really some sort of hell to get through from positive test to waiting for more than 2 weeks to see the ultrasound. 

I hope you can get something out of my experience. I found there to be practically no information about conceiving again after an ectopic and having only one tube. *hugs* ",[],,t1_d742gvw,False,0,[],False,"<div class=""md""><p>TW: currently pregnant.</p>

I cried a lot in front of him and he still stuck by that so if he's wrong I'll just make him feel AWFUL. He met with me for an hour and was super compassionate, but I'm just so scared something is wrong with ME and I'll lose this baby too. 

He did another ultrasound (3 ultrasounds in 3 weeks, woo!) and the baby was measuring right on with 174 HR. Always thankful for that. Hoping I can use my Doppler soon at home.

I do have fairly normal cycles, usually around 30 days. Since I've never tracked them closely (had an IUD previously and rarely had a regular period), I'm not certain about how normal they are all the time. I don't have any memory of being grossly irregular, though. 

So basically, OPKs around 2pm-ish, sometime around CD10, partnered with BBT. So use OPKs to determine when to really get busy, and BBT to more closely ""confirm"" if ovulation actually did happen. 

Or maybe I'll just ramp up the mojo and make sure I get busy every other day from CD10-CD20 :)

OPKs show an LH Surge. LH is a hormone. When it surges, it triggers ovulation. So, tracking when it surges can give you some advance notice that you're about to ovulate. On average, a woman ovulates 12-36 hours after her surge. So if you get a positive, it's time to get busy! :) 

Now, when to test (and not have to test alll the time) is dependent on person/cycle. Do you have regular cycles?

If you have a 28 day cycle, its ""likely"" that you ovulate ~CD14. But that isn't necessarily true of everyone. If you have a 28 day cycle, I'd start using OPKs ~CD10. They will likely darken a bit for a few days, but they are not positive until they are as dark or darker than the control line. For many people, they will darken even more for a couple days before they are actually positive. They might stay looking positive for 2 days -- some people's do. Mine go immediately negative the next day. (Our bodies always have LH, so the test line will likely be colored, just not dark)

You hopefully have at least an 11 day luteal phase (the time after ovulation, before menstruation). A fertilized egg needs that time to implant. My cycles are 24ish days,  which is short. But I ovulate CD12, almost religiously. So I have an 11-12 day luteal phase. So I get a positive OPK on CD10 or 11. Some people have a much longer cycle - same thing, you're hopefully ovulating at least 11 days before your period. Again - how long is your cycle, if regular? 

In general you should try to collect your urine between 10am and 8pm. The optimum time is supposed to fall between 2pm and 2.30pm. 

Try to collect your urine at about the same time every day, though not absolutely necessary. Don't test your urine as soon as you wake up, because you may miss the first day of your LH surge. Try to reduce the amount of liquids you drink for about two hours before you do the test. Too much liquid will dilute your urine, which could make it more difficult to detect the surge. You can definitely test more than once in a day if you want - afternoon seems to work best for me personally.

Once you have used them for a couple cycles, you will likely be able to see a trend and possibly use them less days in a row (if having regular cycles).

BUT -- OPKS cannot tell you if you DO ovulate. There can be an LH surge and no ovulation. So temping is the only good at home way to show ovulation. You have been using a BBT -- does your chart show clear ovulation patterns?

Hmm did that help at all?

I'm a bit hormotional today. An old ""friend"" who I haven't spoken to for a few months messages me. We haven't really been friends since high school but periodically she tries to talk to me and reconnect before she goes nuclear and disappears again.

 She was asking about how I was feeling. She's been trying to get pregnant and told me how she's so jealous of me. She then tells me how I ""got lucky"" to get pregnant. 

We tried for months before getting pregnant. Then I had a miscarriage. I was completely devastated. It took me months of trying again. Charting, temping, checking my cervical mucus, ovulation strips, the whole she-bang. She knows this. 

I tell her how we worked really hard and saw doctors and charted temperature and everything, even though she heard all of this before. She said that she though temping and charting was nonsense and that she's just been taking clomid and has PCOS. I ""got lucky"" because I didn't use fertility drugs. ""You didn't even have anything wrong with your ovaries. Why did it take you so long to get pregnant if the charting is supposed to help?""

I don't know why she felt the need to say this stuff to me and attempt to belittle my struggle with fertility. Everybody is different and there is no one cause for this stuff. She was absolutely ridiculous. I ignored her and called my husband to cry. Planning on avoiding her for this entire pregnancy and beyond.

Sounds like it would be worth talking to your midwife/doctor about how an epidural would be run.   </p>

It's all happening fast... maybe too fast? I know I should ""lean in"" but work/life balance is SO important to me... so right now I am just trying to figure out if I even want the promotion at all.

<p>Has anyone told you what to expect in regards to grief? If not, know that it will hit harder later on, maybe a few weeks or a month or maybe it is starting now. But scream if you need to. I should have and I didn&#39;t. Anyway, if you have questions about what to expect or your feelings, message me any time. </p>

<p>You gave a terribly hard sacrifice to your daughters in deciding no. You deserve praise and admiration for that, for it is something extremely painful to do but you did it for them. Hugs mama (a tradition  in the south is to call all moms mama). </p>

But I'm trying to get my diet back on track and get in better shape, and I'm using this month to kick things off.

On Wed., I have a hysteroscopy (this is why we have a month off - RE's office was having trouble with scheduling so they put me on birth control for a month).

It is also weird to be spending time not thinking either, ""Oh my! I MIGHT be pregnant!"" or ""Ok, we've got a few more days and then we have to TTC so we can get pregnant!""  I don't think I realized how my life has been consumed by TTC and the miscarriages.

We've got three tough dates coming up.  Last year, on Sept. 4, we left the home and town we loved, we left the church we loved, the job my husband enjoyed, and our friends and moved out of state.   We were moving for a better job.  We were moving because the job he enjoyed was no longer workable.  But it was a hard move.  Since then, we've had a really shitty year (two miscarriages, two cats died, and two horses died, and DH's grandmother died).  We're incredibly lonely here - we don't have friends, a church we love, etc.  We want to get back to Texas but we're having trouble finding a decent job for DH there.  

Sometime in September will be the 12th anniversary of my first miscarriage.  I feel stupid not remembering the exact date... The other two are so burned into my mind. I think it was because i didn't know I was pregnant until the day before, and I didn't know exactly what I was missing when I lost that baby.  I still mourn his/her loss, but it didn't affect me at the time so severely.

And on October 1st, we will have the first anniversary of miscarriage #2.  I had had one healthy pregnancy and baby before then, and I didn't really think miscarriage was a possibility.  After all, I had had my one and then a baby, so i couldn't have another one, right?  (Such foolish thinking!  I so didn't know...).  When we went in to the appointment, it was to meet a new doctor (since we had just moved) and get a routine visit.  She listened for the heartbeat and heard nothing.  She tried a regular ultrasound and couldn't find anything.  She finally found it was a transvaginal ultrasound. I should have been over 11 weeks along, but the baby had stopped growing at 8 weeks. I had a natural miscarriage that night.

This next year will be a year of first anniversaries - the first anniversary of this crappy move, the first anniversary of miscarriage #2, the first anniversary of Ginger (cat) dying, the first anniversary of Late Fee (cat) and Magic (horse) dying (on the same day), the first anniversary of Chip (horse) dying, and the first anniversary of miscarriage #3.

Getting to be pregnant and excited for a month, then having it taken away is so hard. More of what I&#39;m saying is that everyone&#39;s struggle is hard in their eyes. There are probably people who see mine and think I&#39;m being whiny and there are things much worse. </p>

I hear people say how they knew they were pregnant and what not, and totally call BS, and think it is confirmation bias plus luck.

Selfishly, I'm glad the choice was taken from me of having to choose whether he had invasive and painful treatments done to try and save his life or not, as our son was stillborn we didn't have the choice.

What did your girls weigh? James was 1lb 5oz, at the time I thought it was a good weight but he turned out to be in the 4th percentile due to severe IUGR. 

Those cold cots are truly wonderful inventions, we spent 14 hours with James and I too regret not spending longer with him, but we were terrified of seeing him change in front of us and the nurses had started getting quite anxious about us making a decision on when to say goodbye. 

It's a terrible pain, one that doesn't seem bearable or survivable at the beginning, but I promise you can get through this time. You just have to keep living until you feel alive again, the rest can wait. 

Edit:

I wanted to add... I understand that overwhelming desire to try again as soon as you are able. I knew in my heart I wasn't ready emotionally or mentally to try again after our loss but yet not trying was unbearable, so we began ttc one cycle after our sons death.

Granted he was measuring ahead before, but right now he&#39;s in the 53rd percentile. What really gets me the most is when she asks me how I&#39;m feeling and I say &#39;not good&#39;... She acts like that&#39;s an inappropriate response and that I should be feeling wonderful. Like, No. Don&#39;t ask me how I&#39;m feeling then expect me to lie to you and tell you I feel great when I am uncomfortable, on the verge of throwing up, can barely move and in constant pain. That&#39;s not how it works. </p>

Today was a vomit-free day! After throwing up about 10 times last night, my son appears to be on the mend. My husband and I haven't gotten sick...yet. 

We had a quiet day at home so he could recover. He fell asleep in the sofa and we had to wake him up after about 3 hours. He wasn't very hungry but we did get some starchy bland foods into him and lots of water. After his nap he played soccer in the house and used dad as a climbing gym/trampoline so the tummy bug hasn't phased him too much. I suspect he'll be 100% by tomorrow.
