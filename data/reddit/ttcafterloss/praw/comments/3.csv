Loss at 18 weeks due to Incompetent Cervix
  
**2. Did you have a D&C/surgery/etc. or lose the pregnancy naturally?**
  
Water broke at 17+5. Labour did not start naturally. I chose to be induced at 18 weeks with an oxytocin drip. I had a d&c after as the placenta would not detach (common in the 2nd trimester.)
  
**3. How long did you have period-like bleeding after your loss?**
  
Medium bleeding directly after the d&c (cd1) and for the following 2 days. Light bleeding cd4. 
  
**4. How long did you spot for?**
  
Spotting and intermittent light bleeding from cd5 till cd16 where I had a day of medium bleeding followed by two days of light bleeding, two days of light brown spotting, then yellow lochia that I stopped tracking around cd24.
  
**5. Did you need any additional followup for the bleeding/spotting (i.e. a D&C to remove retained tissue)? If applicable - did your doctor consider your level of bleeding to be ""normal""?**

My post-partum bleeding was normal.

**6. Add any additional relevant details here.**
  
After the delivery, I had a two week follow up with my doctor to check that my cervix was closing/closed. It was still slightly open at that time. Due to the blood loss I also had bi-weekly blood tests done to ensure that my haemoglobin levels were going back up and that the iron supplements that I was taking were helping.  Four weeks after my loss I had another cervix check at which point it appeared closed. However, since I was still having spotting/lochia, she recommended that I continue pelvic rest (no sex, no baths, no tampons, no heavy lifting, no vigorous exercise etc etc) for another two weeks or until the lochia stopped. 
  
My period resumed 49 days after my loss.

1. What type of loss did you have (i.e. miscarriage, ectopic, stillbirth, etc.) and how far along were you?

A. missed miscarriage at 10 weeks. The baby had stopped growing right after my first u/s at 6w4d.

B. Chemical pregnancy at 5w4d.

2. Did you have a D&C/surgery/etc. or lose the pregnancy naturally?

A. naturally

B. naturally


3. How long did you have period-like bleeding after your loss?

A. 5 days after one day of lots of large clots over the course of about 8 hours.

B. 4 days all like a normal period


4. How long did you spot for?

A. Two or three days before bleeding started, and two days after bleeding stopped.

B. One day before, one after


5. Did you need any additional followup for the bleeding/spotting (i.e. a D&C to remove retained tissue)? If applicable - did your doctor consider your level of bleeding to be ""normal""?

A. my experience was "" normal"" with no follow up. I was urged to keep my first prenatal appt with my midwife though I was no longer pregnant. She spent over an hour with me, listening to me cry, and answering all my questions.

B. My experience was normal. One call to the midwife, blood draw to check hcg the day before mc started.


6. Add any additional relevant details here.

A. my first loss was traumatic. It involved less-than-helpful advice from a midwife who'd been there/done that and did not really help me understand what to expect. It also involved a trip to the ER, which involved a lot of insensitivity to my situation and women's health in general.
I was utterly unprepared for how long miscarriage takes. You just watch life drain out of you for days-this was the hardest part for me.

I had mild cramps for two days following the main event.

B. My second loss was a nonevent in comparison to the first.

My bleeding was very unusual.  It came and went for a full six weeks after my loss...at which point I realized things were definitely not quite right.  At six weeks and change, an ultrasound revealed that I did in fact have some retained tissue.  I had a D&C between 6 and 7 weeks post-partum.

I had spoken to my doctor about my bleeding still being red/sometimes heavy at around 3 weeks, but she said there was a wide range of ""normal.""

4. My CP began with spotting at 4w5d which continued on and off for two days until cramping and period like bleeding began. I began spotting with the ectopic at 5w and spotted with one to two gushes of bright red blood per day until I went to the ER at 5w5 days-so 4-5 days of spotting. After the period like bleeding stopped after surgery, I spotted for 2-3 days. 

5. I didn't need any follow up care for bleeding or tissue retention. In both cases, my doctor considered the amount of bleeding I had to be normal. I did have a beta a couple of weeks after my CP to make sure that HCG was at zero. Follow up after the ectopic was limited to surgical wound checks. 

6. I remember thinking it was weird that I bled after the ectopic because the discharge instructions only said I may have bleeding. I found out at the follow up that it was totally normal because the lining still needed to be shed from my uterus. But I also wasn't clear on whether or not the doctor did a D&C with the salpingectomy because he said I might need one but given the bleeding after, I don't think he did. (I should probably request my op note now that I'm writing this because that's good to know info.) I also cramped a lot on the right side after surgery while everything healed.

1) My husband was amazing during both losses - During my first miscarriage (at home), he kept the heating pad, water, and comfort food coming. On the EDD for that loss, he bought me flowers and was so supportive. When we found out about the second loss and that I'd need a D&C, we had to sit in the train station a while before we could get home, and I'll never forget how we both cried into our giant Cinnabon. It meant a lot to me that he was able to be vulnerable with me in public. Later, he even wrote a poem about the loss. He got a tiny potted rose bush in memory of the baby. He also took care of calling all the family so that I wouldn't have to. Anyway, he's awesome, and I'm so happy to be with him.

2) I had a dental checkup when I was early pregnant, so they knew I was expecting. After the miscarriage, my tooth broke. The receptionist called me the day of the appointment and said, ""We see in our records that you're pregnant; we just wanted to make sure you got the OK from your OB to have dental work."" Cue awkward conversation.... When I got to the appointment, my dentist (who has been my dentist since I was a kid) said right away, ""I am so sorry for your loss, and I hope that our call this morning didn't bring up any bad memories. We had no idea. I just needed to make sure I had the approval from your OB if you were pregnant, because you're like a daughter to me, and I could never forgive myself if something happened because of me."" Just his awareness that it might have caused me pain and his sadness over my loss and desire for me to be happy and healthy meant so much.

*Nearly 70% of women experience breast pain at some point in their lives.

If the breasts are sore up front and over the nipples, it tends to suggest high estrogen, or estrogen dominance, which can indicate a lack of ovulation. Soreness on the sides and the front may indicate that ovulation occurred but that not much progesterone was produced three or four days after ovulation, and thus estrogen dominance is occurring.*

*Which hormone – estrogen or progesterone – is responsible for breast pain just prior to a woman’s menstrual cycle? Often progesterone is cited as the culprit probably because breast tenderness is a symptom of the luteal phase when both hormones are present in higher levels.*

That that light might come back as the same personality-energy, and it might take a few tries to come in, learn, leave, assimilate lessons, and return when it’s ready. I feel the same for myself - I needed to learn some important lessons through these miscarriages. I am a different and better-prepared person now. And while I wish I didn’t have to walk this particular path, I am glad I learned the lessons I did from having walked it….lessons I don’t think I could have learned otherwise.""

That doesn't help with what to say, but... for me it takes the sting out of comments like, ""You'll have the baby you are supposed to have."" and ""You look so great holding a baby!""

I just need to get it out because it's bugging me more than it should. Friday night I found out that my sister in law is pregnant.

I remember thinking it was weird. My husband and I didn't say much about it while we were at my mom's, but as soon as we got in the car to head home, we just started letting it all out. 

It feels just as bad as it would feel if I weren't pregnant. I'm jealous and sad and feel slighted like this was done to me on purpose. (The timing does line up for it to have happened on purpose, too.) Logically, that's all ridiculous, but I feel like a petulant five year old who was robbed of her very own princess birthday party or something. And it just makes me feel even more like my pregnancy will fail while hers will succeed. And if that happens, I told my husband he might as well sign the commitment papers to put me away because I won't be able to stay sane anymore. 

My brother was apparently caught by surprise by this. He wasn't ready for another baby. They already have three. And the three they have don't get a lot of attention. They do things like dump the kids for a week so they can go to Cancun. I know, I have no idea what it's like to have three little kids. Maybe I'd want to run away to Cancun, too. To me, it's like watching them squander a precious gift that I've worked so hard to get for myself. A gift that has been so close twice before, but slipped away disastrously. And now they're having another baby by accident like it's the easiest thing in the world. 

My sister in law kept telling my mom that she wasn't trying to ""steal my thunder"" when they talked I guess. The fact that she said that just makes me feel more suspicious. My husband told my brother about our pregnancy when I was at 5ish weeks because they work together and I'm sure he told my sister in law, too. Plenty of time for her to decide ""I want one too,"" watch her cycle, and grab some sexy time around her ovulation. 

I'm awful. I shouldn't think these things. I probably need to try to see my therapist because I keep thinking these awful things. I know other people's lives don't stop because of what goes on in mine. I know I don't control the universe and that it also doesn't revolve around me. I know babies are supposed to be good news and in my pre-loss life where I was blissfully ignorant and had two Fallopian tubes, I'd probably be all ""Yay, we'll be pregnant together!"" But in this reality, I feel sulky. I want to take my ball and go home.

I can't sleep. Mostly because my husband is snoring loud as hell, but also because I'm doing my NIPT blood draw tomorrow and that's bringing up a lot of feelings. I feel like once I get this blood draw, the clock will start ticking, counting down towards finally knowing if this baby is healthy or not. I'm not joking when I say I have PTSD from what happened with Oliver. I've had some flashbacks/memories come up lately. I just keep remembering the looks on my doctors' faces.. the ""oh shit"" look they got when they first looked at my ultrasounds, the pity look when they gave me bad news.. those faces just keep popping up in my head. I've also been  thinking a lot about my actual termination/induction but I won't go into details because just thinking about it for a second is so painful, and honestly I wouldn't want to subject any of you to hearing about what it was like. I haven't told anybody about the images I remember from that day, although maybe I should. I feel like they're my horrible secrets to keep. For some reason these memories always seem to come to me late at night. 

Overall haven't been as nervous about this pregnancy as I was with Oliver - even BEFORE I had any idea something was wrong with him, I was a nervous wreck. You'd think I would be more nervous this time, but I feel strangely calm. I don't know if it's a ""good"" kind of calm though. I think it's more of a detachment from this pregnancy, or a feeling of whatever happens, happens. It sounds terrible to say, but I feel like, if I lose this baby too, I won't be surprised, and I don't know if I'll be that upset. I feel like I KNOW how to have a loss. I don't KNOW how to have a normal pregnancy. Sometimes I wonder if I'll be more scared if the doctor tells me everything is okay - because that means I'll have to actually start planning for this baby as though it's going to be born. That's kind of a new concept to me now. Last time I was planning for my baby's inevitable death.. I knew it was going to happen, it was just a matter of when and how. I don't really know how to be happy and excited for a healthy baby. I feel like I'll always be finishing sentences with ""..if this baby is born"" and that's kind of sad. I wish I was one of those moms who expects everything to turn out perfectly. 

Edit: I read this and thought about how I've been presenting myself and my thoughts on this pregnancy, both on this sub and IRL (to the few people who know I'm pregnant). I think overall I'm bottling up a lot of these negative thoughts and keeping them to myself. I DO have happy feelings and hopes for this pregnancy, but they're fleeting and always seem to be followed by a ""what if"" or ""hopefully""... and I think that memories and feelings about my previous loss are 70% of my thoughts and happiness about this pregnancy is the other 30%. I just don't talk about it a lot for a couple reasons. Firstly, I guess I feel like it's unfair to this baby to talk about my loss or fears too much... like he/she deserves to be talked about positively, even if I'm not feeling that positive inside. Secondly, I don't think I realized how much I was thinking about the past during this pregnancy until I started writing this. I think I've been putting on a brave face for everyone to see but that's not what I'm really feeling inside.

My new OB just told me she sees woman who have 2 in a row frequently who go one to have healthy pregnancies. I hate being part of this awful statistic. Honestly though, I&#39;m not sure what else I&#39;d do differently. Aside from IVF with pgs, there&#39;s no way to know if the eggs are of good quality or not. We just keep trying.</p>

I know how hard and scary it can be, both the loss and trying again. 

The most important thing to remember is that you should never blame yourself. Even for perfectly stress-free, healthy women, 10-30% of pregnancies still end in miscarriage (usually due to random and unavoidable chromosomal errors). The vast majority of women don't have the luxury of spending their whole pregnancy resting up, and their pregnancies are still normal and healthy, more often than not. Sadly the most likely answer is that the baby just wasn't developing normally, and that there was nothing you could have done differently to save it.

Now for the [good news](http://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-living/getting-pregnant/in-depth/pregnancy-after-miscarriage/art-20044134). 

""Miscarriage is usually a one-time occurrence. Most women who miscarry go on to have a healthy pregnancy after miscarriage. Less than 5 percent of women have two consecutive miscarriages, and only 1 percent have three or more consecutive miscarriages.""

Studies have also shown that you are less likely to miscarry again if you get pregnant within six months of a miscarriage. So try to go forward with hope, because the chances *are* on your side. It can be difficult to try again after the trauma of a loss - you will have bad days and good days and angry days and everything in between. And that is totally OK. But it does get better over time, and having the support of the wonderful group of ladies here definitely makes a big difference. The odds are very much in your favor that one day you will be holding a healthy baby in your arms, and if you can remember that then it helps make all of the sacrifices and stress of TTC worthwhile.",[],,t1_cpmbfp0,False,0,[],False,"<div class=""md""><p>I just want to say that I am truly sorry for your loss.

>I have a suspicion that my body gears up to ovulate but never does due to lack of progesterone.

Not quite.  Let's put your spotting issue aside for a moment, and focus on the hormones involved in pre-ovulation, ovulation, and post-ovulation.

As the other two ladies here have said, progesterone is a *post-ovulation* hormone.  This hormone rises as a result of the collapsed follicle releasing the egg and then releasing the progesterone hormone.  Thus, your statement above isn't correct, because progesterone doesn't rise until *after* ovulation.

[You like charts?  I like charts.  They're pretty.](http://en.wikiversity.org/wiki/Reference_ranges_for_estradiol,_progesterone,_luteinizing_hormone_and_follicle-stimulating_hormone_during_the_menstrual_cycle)

Check out the second chart, progesterone.  You'll see it supports what I just said.

Ok, so since you're concerned about whether you're ovulating or not, let's talk about the magical hormones that make ovulation occur.  

The first one is FSH, of follicle-stimulating hormone.  It's literally exactly what its name implies - it makes you grow follicles which contain eggs!  You'll see in the chart that it starts at a nice level, has a nice round long bump to encourage your ovary to make and grow that follicle/egg, and then gets all excited for one last follicle growth push just before ovulation.

The second one is estradiol, aka estrogen.  You'll see in the first chart that you get a nice little rise in this hormone that begins rising around 5 days before you ovulate.  This helps support a lot of things, one of which is the thickness of your lining.  If you get way down the road in fertility assistance, you'll likely be given these as a supplement if a mid-cycle ultrasound reveals your lining isn't quite as thick and lush as they would like it.  

The third hormone is LH, or the luteinizing hormone.  This is the magical hormone that OPKs are testing for.  This hormone, unlike estrogen, has a huge quick SPIKE!  You don't get many days of warning, typically the OPK darkens a bit one or maaaaybe two days before a positive, otherwise you get the dark line or smiley and BAM it's baby-makin' time!  LH is what makes that egg actually release from the follicle.

And then of course post-ovulation we have the progesterone which supports the hopeful growth and implantation of a fertilized egg.  Without the presence of a fertilized egg and the hcg which the fertilized egg releases, the body stops the progesterone production because it knows it's not pregnant and doesn't need the progesterone to create a nice happy baby environment, and when it gets quite low, that signals it's time for a period.

Isn't this fun?

Ok so your concern about having issues with ovulation.  Again, this is likely a separate issue from the spotting, so let's talk about ovulation.

Since there are three key hormones which are important for ovulation (grow the follicle, grow the lining, release the egg), any of these could have issues.  For many ladies with PCOS, they have lower levels of FSH, meaning there's not enough of that hormone to grow one nice big follicle.  All their follicles grow a little bit, and it can take them weeks, months, more to either create a follicle, or their body bails at some point and they have an anovulatory cycle.  

While estrogen causes the build up of the lining, once it reaches a high enough level it's responsible for triggering your pituitary gland to release the LH hormone, so it's actually a pretty important little trigger.  Not enough and you may not get your surge until it's too late and your follicle is too big, or your body just isn't sure what to do.  And even if you do get your trigger on time, this could be the cause of multiple CPs because your lining isn't glorious enough to implant in.

Finally, LH.  LH is a tricky little bugger, because it needs to come at the right time and strong enough.  Timing is important because if the egg is too immature or mature, it can't be fertilized.  Strength is also important, because if you get a lot of ""weak"" positive OPKs, it might not be enough to rupture the follicle and get that egg out.  And an egg that stays in the follicle is pretty useless!

Of the three of these hormones, I would say the most common issue ladies with even mild infertility is the FSH.  Making the actual follicle isn't always easy, but more often than not, the estrogen and LH figure out what to do when the follicle is there.  Don't get me wrong though, I personally have an LH problem with timing (waits waaay to long to surge, old crappy over-ripe eggs at that point!), so anything is possible!

Alright, now let's go back to your immediate concern about taking the progesterone.  Since progesterone is a post-ovulation hormone, it's actually really important both to the proper function of the menstrual cycle, but also to pregnancy!  Progesterone makes your body a happy place for a fertilized egg, so if you take it and you don't know if you've ovulated or not, that's not only totally ok, it actually will help support your pregnancy if you happened to ovulate and get a fertilized egg.  Just make sure you take a pregnancy test on your last day of progesterone pills (likely 10-12 days?).  If you're not pregnant, stop the progesterone, and your body will be ""tricked"" into thinking it's in the second half of that chart, your progesterone will plummet, and you'll get a period.  If you're pregnant, let your doctor know and they will likely wean you off the progesterone slowly so that you don't confuse your body with a sudden drop in progesterone levels.  But many of us ladies who are doing assisted fertility treatments all take progesterone post-ovulation (beginning at 3DPO) to help support a hopeful pregnancy, and if we get pregnant, that's exactly the protocol.  Typically stay on it until 8-12 weeks and wean off with a pretty fixed schedule.  I definitely know women who were on these boards who had repeated CPs and turns out they had a progesterone deficiency post-ovulation, and that's all they needed to help support a healthy pregnancy!

However, once you start progesterone, it's highly unlikely you will ovulate if you have not already.  Since it makes your body think you're already post-ovulation, all those other hormones won't keep doing anything.  In fact, there is a birth control pill called the ""mini pill"" which is literally just progesterone!

As for your ""crazy spotting"" - I've written enough of a novel here that I'm going to forego stalking your history and just say that it is likely related to either estrogen or progesterone or both (since they both have an impact on lining - estrogen to build it up and the dip in progesterone to make you start your period).  Supplementing either or both of these things at appropriate times in your cycle can help.  I'm not sure how long you've been experiencing the crazy spotting, and it's certainly possible that your body is just having an ""off"" cycle and resetting it with progesterone will be just the ticket and you'll be good to go from here.

I hung out with one of my best friends who used to be my same weight before I put it all back on and I felt so pathetic and like I had failed. I weight 140lbs, I'm not a big girl, I have a tiny frame, but I still feel **huge**...but I can't describe why.

I am so mad at my body for everything. I was on Vyvanse for ADHD, which has been so hard to control after going off it last year. I'm so mad that I can't keep a baby alive. And I'm so mad for letting my brain flip flop between thinking that maybe I've never seen a second line...maybe I just made it up because I wanted to see one SO BADLY and I don't even belong in this sub or that I am dead certain I saw two lines. And I'm so mad at my body for gaining the weight back.

I got on the scale this morning and holy fuck I lost five more pounds.

I won't know where I'm working or living or when we can have a family together.

I chose to go to college in state because I wanted to stay close to her and now she's leaving.

It was super easy. I wonder if it's more common here because CA has the prenatal screening program? Everyone I know has had one regardless of age or risk. 

I also wonder if NIPT (Maternit21, etc) might be a better option if your insurance might not cover the NT scan. I think they billed my insurance several hundred dollars for my NT scan, although it was covered so I paid very little.. but I think it was comparable in price to the out of pocket costs for NIPT. The highest out of pocket cost I was quoted for NIPT was $995 but they do payment plans and I heard they might discount it to like $200 if your insurance denies you (but don't quote me on that because I've read conflicting info). Plus then you get the bonus of knowing the gender. :)

Chances are that everything will be okay if you wait until your anatomy scan, BUT even though it's depressing to think about.. I would consider what you would do if you did get bad news. If you would terminate, some states have strict laws on how late you can do that, so I'd check and make sure your anatomy scan doesn't make things too late. Plus it's more expensive and a longer process the farther along you are (and insurances almost never cover it, unless your doctor fudges paperwork like mine did).

I told my chiropractor this afternoon. He got really worried, and asked if I'd had my blood pressure checked recently. I had not, so he checked it. Turns out my blood pressure is fine (on the low side of normal, which he thinks is causing the wooziness with hormones and increased blood volume causing the headaches). 

BUT PSA: he said, that kind of headache is exactly the kind of headache that indicates hypertension, which is common in the third tri. He told me to keep an eye on it, and ask my midwife to monitor blood pressure just in case.

If your headaches change, let your doctors know!

 Do you have an iron supplements or vitamins with iron? Take one either way because your body will need it. Drink lots of water and lie down and don't do any lifting or exercises.

You may be having that much pain due to contractions/pressure. The tissues/sac may be stuck at the cervix so the uterus is contracting. Try bearing down on the toilet and pushing, think reverse kegels but looong and hard and through your rectum as if pooing. But only try this one or two times, I'm not a doctor and am worried this may be the wrong advice.

>* What was the best present that you ever received as a child?

A pony for my 7th birthday, as I had been riding my mother's horse since birth. Yes, I was that kid. We weren't well-off, my mother was just a rancher at heart so I grew up on a ""hobby ranch"" with all types of animals. I was homeschooled, so spent most of the day outside alone learning about plants and nature and animals. Misty was my Shetland pony, she was a complete ass and kicked me many times. Cute though!

> What was your favourite book and/or toy as a child?

The Laura Ingalls Wilder series. I wanted to show Laura the modern world.

> What did childhood you love to eat, that adult you wouldn't touch now? 

I can't think of anything I don't like now. I hate raisins and mincemeat and won't touch it, but was the same as a child.

Best present: for my (8th?) birthday I got a toy laptop [like this](http://ed342.gse.stanford.edu/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/vtech.jpg) and I taught myself to type and then how to write BASIC. I had so much fun with that thing, I wish I still had it! 

Favorite book: The Giving Tree is my all time favorite children's book. As a kid I also loved those [Scary Stories to Tell in the Dark](http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scary_Stories_to_Tell_in_the_Dark) books but I had to read them at my friend's house because my mom wouldn't let me have them. They scared the living hell out of me! There was this one story about a girl with a green ribbon around her neck that scarred me for life. 

Favorite toy: besides that laptop, I was super into Barbies for a looooong time. I still love them. I always buy my niece Barbies although I don't think she's that into them. I just loved buying new outfits and having my Barbies have fights with each other and have affairs with other Barbies' husbands (my brother's GI Joes, because they were way hotter than Ken). It was like Jerry Springer for dolls. 

Food: I would eat pretty much anything as a kid and I'm still not picky. When I was a kid I really liked to eat mustard sandwiches - I'd take two pieces of white bread and smother them with French's yellow mustard and eat it. I probably wouldn't do that now. :)",[],,t1_cpeyapf,False,0,[],False,"<div class=""md""><p>I like this one!</p>

Even a few cells of placental tissue can put back your period and ovulation by a month or two.

<p>Now that I&#39;ve had my first period since mc, I&#39;m just waiting for ovulation time. We have had sex twice, once I couldn&#39;t sleep (caffeine too late, figured why not) it was 2am lol. </p>

<p>You&#39;re not alone. It makes no sense. But it&#39;s real and the men don&#39;t understand.</p>

I've had two strong NO votes from my mom and a friend who had one during her pregnancy, but I am still on the fence. I know a few of you have them, and I know /u/SansaScully has posted elsewhere that it makes her feel reassured, so I'd like some more opinions.

I was hoping you'd never find out they existed so I wouldn't have to talk you out of buying one.""

yes that's unfair but either he didn't feel as deeply, or, because of his childhood he's just better at hiding emotional pain.

I've been lurking in the sub for a while, but I haven't introduced myself.  But your post really upsets me, and I wanted to reach out and make sure you're okay.  I'm a clinical microbiologist, and working with blood cultures like the ones you had is my job.

First of all, contamination like this happens ALL THE TIME, which is just unfortunate.  The second doctor at urgent care was right, and I hope he made you feel better that you almost certainly do not have septicemia (a blood infection).  The ED draws blood cultures from pretty much everyone to cover their own asses, and unfortunately they get contaminated a lot.  The contamination limit for lab accreditation is just about 3%--meaning that 3% of blood cultures are expected to be positive with bacteria that is not representative of whats in the blood.  

As for their excuses, um no.  If we used expired sample jars, we would get shut down faster than something that goes really fast.  There is extensive quality control that goes into lab materials.  Its like half my job.  Lab contamination?  I also call BS.  There is zero reason for the lab to open the bottles once they're collected, so there's no way for bacteria to get in after the fact.  So what does that leave?  I'll put all of my money on bad practices by the phlebotomist who drew the blood.

You have picture proof that that person had no idea what the hell they were doing.  

Here's what you can do: complain.  And see if you can refuse to pay for the culture, because they had bad collection practices.  I'm not saying it will work, but if you have the energy and desire to fight The Man, it would be helpful for other patients, and maybe make you feel better.  

On behalf of my profession, I am so sorry.  I want us to be better than this.  I'm happy to answer any questions you might have; more people need to know what goes on behind the scenes.

7 DPO: Took two HPTs so I could get clear negatives and know that any lines I saw after would be positives. Both tests were clear negatives (used one FRER and one Answers brand test)

8 DPO: Took Frer with SMU at noon. Faint positive in the time frame. Darker than Janurary's chemical so I am happy. 

9 DPO: Frer negative FMU. Frer extremely faint positive SMU
Answers test stark white negative.
Equate blue dye rapid result faint bfp at 9 pm with two hour hold. 

10 DPO: Stark white negative frers all day. Squinter BFP on Equate blue dye rapid result. 

11 DPO: Five negatives. 9 DPO negative dried positive and I notice this day and get really sad. I decided to throw out my HPTs from last month on this day. All of my frers from last month dried positive. Even the ones I had discarded or recorded as negative. This proves to me that frers are extremely sensitive. When DH and I were moving I found a 4 month old negative frer that was still stark white so I have made note of that for the future. OBVIOUSLY checking tests after the time limit is not recommended but I am using this information to help cope so sue me. :P

12 DPO: Took my last two tests. Tricked myself into thinking I saw a squinter but did not. Bought as bottle of wine and cried :P

CD31 (didn't want to post in the ttc thread about this, even though technically I'm not pregnant yet). Hope it is cool to post in here.

Had a beta hcg draw today. Felt sick after, kind of an emotional thing. Thought I was fine, but afterwards I felt down, as it is likely either a CP or that hcg will be 0 and my body is just acting up.

No AF, period is 4 days late. Still having mild ""morning sickness"". I know the feeling too well, if something else is causing it then I'll be damned because it is the exact same feeling.

So now is the wait for the call. I am not expecting good news either way. 

Nice weather though. Had a meltdown last night, bought a big blue bunny and easter eggs and an egg basket for the cemetery. A little girl about 4 asked me if it was mine, she said she liked it. I said it was for my little boy. She asked where he was. I wanted to say something cute like ""he's an angel"", but didn't want to piss her Dad off by starting THAT convo with his kid.

Are you seeing an MFM or a GP tomorrow? My first follow up was with my GP. She checked my haemoglobin levels because of blood loss during the delivery, checked my cervix to see if it was closed, and I *think* she did a culture. I can't remeber right now. My first follow up with my MFM, she relayed the placental pathology report, discussed the diagnosis and what it meant for future pregnancies, and did a cervical check because I had sustained a cervical tear earlier that year that had never been assessed.

Before this I finished Under the Banner of Heaven by Jon Krakauer. It's a nonfiction story about a murder committed by Fundamentalist LDS members, but it also includes a really interesting history (from the author's perspective) of the Mormon church and his theories as to why the religion can so easily open up to these fundamentalist, polygamist sects that do crazy things like marry off their 12 year olds. He mentions the Elizabeth Smart case and talks a lot about Warren Jeffs. It sounds boring, but as you read it, it's a pageturner. I could not put it down. My mom told me while I was reading it that we had Mormon ancestors but on the trip from Nauvoo to Utah, our family stopped for the winter in Iowa and never continued the trip, so I really want to go pick my grandma's brain about it.

My brain is thinking &quot;I got pregnant and didn&#39;t get a baby, why would I think another pregnancy will be any different?&quot;. I know it&#39;s not true and I keep telling myself that I can do this again, there&#39;s nothing saying that anything will ever happen again (well, I was supposed to be 95% certain last pregnancy would hold so statistics haven&#39;t been treating me well anyways). I feel like I&#39;m putting all my effort into just getting pregnant and then I&#39;ll just end up not knowing what the hell I&#39;m doing. At the beginning I daydreamed about my baby, thought of names, thought of how I&#39;d do the nursery and stuff like that. Now I feel like all that has been taken away from me. I want a baby but I&#39;m dreading needing to go through another pregnancy :( And here I am worrying about that and I&#39;m not even ttc yet!! Ugh.. my head is just all a mess today :(</p>

I am so sorry that this has happened to you but know that it is an unpreventable tragedy. </p>

I don't believe it. I wouldn't believe it if I read this post. I don't even know how to process this.

It was my birthday night and it was my husband's the next day and the moment was right so I had him watch the digital test, just like I planned. I'm in the shower and call out asking what the result is. He comes back saying it is neg. I pretend I am just disappointed and google all night. They say digital ones are faulty and crap. I stare at my positive dollar store test for hours. I google similar pics. They say that's a positive. Okay, stupid digital test just can't detect it.


I leave him a note this morning saying to run to the dollar store this morning and buy me a bunch (he gets up early). He comes home and wakes me up and I run to pee first morning pee and guys, I believed it would be positive 100%.  The C line popped up deep purple immediately. And...nothing else. I sat there for ten minutes and nothing. I took another. Nothing. White as fresh snow. 

I haven't cried this hard since my son passed in my arms. I actually threw something in the kitchen while screaming.

I had even called my doctor's office and told them the good news. They are excited and planning who my new OB will be. I told my mom (non-bio). 

My husband is in tears at my reaction. It's his birthday so I gotta keep it together.  

I am so, so stupid. So stupid. Next month would be the same due date as my son (if AF is on time). I was SO excited that it was this month instead.

I know we can't post pregnancy test pics here but I want to show you guys the positive one so bad, so that I can prove to myself that I'm not this stupid. 

I am so sorry. Like I can't even express my shame. Thank you for the congrats, I will save them for ""next time"".

Update: [Here's a pic. Sorry for the scribbles. I don't have the digital as I took out the strip to check that last night. The third one is a fresh new one.

<p>I am so sorry. Like I can&#39;t even express my shame. Thank you for the congrats, I will save them for &quot;next time&quot;.</p>

<p>Update: <a href=""http://imgur.com/UqRlhB8"">Here&#39;s a pic. Sorry for the scribbles. I don&#39;t have the digital as I took out the strip to check that last night. The third one is a fresh new one. You can sorta see the line in the first one but so faint, or am I crazy?</a> I&#39;m over it now, and feeling silly for having gotten so upset/excited in the first place. Ah well, I will keep trying!</p>

<p>Thanks to everyone for the compassion. You have no idea how much that has helped.</p>

I'm totally fascinated...

I found an article that gives a general rundown of NIPT as of 2014. 

But buyer beware: the article is written by a lawyer with a background in bioethics, he advocates for genetic rights, has a child with Down Syndrome, and runs a website that is dedicated to gathering information about genetic issues and prenatal testing. After looking through the site, I found it to be even-handed. He's not on a soapbox of any sort, but he does appear to want expecting parents to be informed enough to make wise decisions (rather than be confused or misled by the medical/pharmaceutical industry). 

Here's the link:
http://www.downsyndromeprenataltesting.com/three-years-on-what-have-we-learned-about-non-invasive-prenatal-screening/

Another article on his site summarizes a study published in the New England Journal of Medicine in 2014. The study assessed the positive predictive value of NIPTs versus traditional screenings (the general prenatal screening including blood tests plus NT scan, aka the BUN test). The study found that the positive predictive value of NIPTs is far greater than traditional screening. But they also found that the positive predictive value of NIPTs was only 45.5% - meaning that even if you get a positive, it is more likely (like just over 50/50) that your test was a false positive than a true positive, and you should follow up with a diagnostic test for more certainty. The study tested the detection of trisomy 21, 18 and 13.

Here's the link for the article (and the link to the study in NEJoM is linked in the first paragraph):

I am so, so sorry for the loss of your daughter...I have been there.  It sounds like we went through the same experience at almost exactly the same time.  I lost Ethan at 22 weeks on October 4th after finding out that I was pregnant near the end of May.  Until my loss, however, I had no complications or any hint that something was wrong, except for finding a shortened cervix at my anatomy scan.  I didn't go on bedrest (incidentally, bedrest has not been proven to help with cervical insufficiency), but they put me on progesterone suppositories and cautiously decided to see me again two weeks later.  I didn't make it to two weeks later.  It also took us close to a year to get pregnant, and my pregnancy had resulted from a medicated IUI cycle. 

After losing Ethan, I consulted with my counselor, my regular OB-GYN, and my fertility doctor.  My OB-GYN set me up for a consult with the MFM team associated with their network of hospitals, and that appointment gave me so much reassurance that my cervix is fixable.  My MFM will work together with my other doctors to monitor my pregnancy, will place my cerclage, and will conduct frequent monitoring appointments once I'm pregnant again.  They're there to support you through high-risk pregnancies that regular OBs have less expertise with.  

Given that I have no prior history of damage/scarring/abnormalities with my cervix, no previous cervical surgeries, that I did not require invasive fertility treatment to get pregnant (e.g. IVF), and that I am relatively young, my treatment plan for a subsequent pregnancy involves a trans-vaginal cerclage and weekly progesterone injections. I'll also be monitored at least bi-weekly after my first trimester for changes in my cervix...and, let's face it, bi-weekly during my first trimester, too, because that's how my fertility doctor rolls (I had ultrasounds every 10-12 days during my last pregnancy until they kicked me out shortly after 8 weeks.  I had a regular dating ultrasound at my OB not even two weeks after that, and then my NT scan two weeks after that.  That's the plan going forward, too.)  Personally, while another loss would be unimaginably devastating, I don't think the added invasiveness of a TAC is where I'm headed at this time.  

Do you have a regular OB-GYN that you see for yearly pap smears and check-ups?  If not, I would absolutely find one and have a chat with them first, then ask that MFM doctors they routinely partner with and have a pre-pregnancy consultation.  I cannot emphasize enough how at ease my MFM appointment put me the day I finally had it. Pregnancy will be terrifying when it happens again, but I have hope and faith that what went wrong last time is fixable.  You deserve to feel the same way.

Until my loss, however, I had no complications or any hint that something was wrong, except for finding a shortened cervix at my anatomy scan.  I didn&#39;t go on bedrest (incidentally, bedrest has not been proven to help with cervical insufficiency), but they put me on progesterone suppositories and cautiously decided to see me again two weeks later.  I didn&#39;t make it to two weeks later.  It also took us close to a year to get pregnant, and my pregnancy had resulted from a medicated IUI cycle. </p>

<p>After losing Ethan, I consulted with my counselor, my regular OB-GYN, and my fertility doctor.  My OB-GYN set me up for a consult with the MFM team associated with their network of hospitals, and that appointment gave me so much reassurance that my cervix is fixable.  My MFM will work together with my other doctors to monitor my pregnancy, will place my cerclage, and will conduct frequent monitoring appointments once I&#39;m pregnant again.  They&#39;re there to support you through high-risk pregnancies that regular OBs have less expertise with.  </p>

<p>Given that I have no prior history of damage/scarring/abnormalities with my cervix, no previous cervical surgeries, that I did not require invasive fertility treatment to get pregnant (e.g. IVF), and that I am relatively young, my treatment plan for a subsequent pregnancy involves a trans-vaginal cerclage and weekly progesterone injections. I&#39;ll also be monitored at least bi-weekly after my first trimester for changes in my cervix...and, let&#39;s face it, bi-weekly during my first trimester, too, because that&#39;s how my fertility doctor rolls (I had ultrasounds every 10-12 days during my last pregnancy until they kicked me out shortly after 8 weeks.  I had a regular dating ultrasound at my OB not even two weeks after that, and then my NT scan two weeks after that.  That&#39;s the plan going forward, too.)  Personally, while another loss would be unimaginably devastating, I don&#39;t think the added invasiveness of a TAC is where I&#39;m headed at this time.  </p>

<p>Do you have a regular OB-GYN that you see for yearly pap smears and check-ups?  If not, I would absolutely find one and have a chat with them first, then ask that MFM doctors they routinely partner with and have a pre-pregnancy consultation.  I cannot emphasize enough how at ease my MFM appointment put me the day I finally had it. Pregnancy will be terrifying when it happens again, but I have hope and faith that what went wrong last time is fixable.  You deserve to feel the same way.  </p>

It may depend on your insurance, but you should be able to get a referral/recommendation to a specialist from your primary physician (or your standard OBGYN, if you have one). You can also look online for doctors in your area and look up reviews there, or give their practices a call and ask if you need a referral. In many cases you can simply make an appointment over the phone, although it would be worth checking if your insurance requires a referral for payment first.</p>

<p>All the best with everything, and really I hope you find a home here in this sub. We&#39;ve all experienced a loss in the past and I know I find it so comforting to be around people who understand what it is like. </p>

One definition of infertility that is frequently used in the United States by reproductive endocrinologists, doctors who specialize in infertility, to consider a couple eligible for treatment is:

- a woman under 35 has not conceived after 12 months of contraceptive-free intercourse. Twelve months is the lower reference limit for Time to Pregnancy (TTP) by the World Health Organization.[6]

- **a woman over 35 has not conceived after 6 months of contraceptive-free sexual intercourse.**

I am not high risk, nor do I have any medical history that would indicate necessity for this test. I AM over 35, which is one of the reasons listed under medical necessity.

I asked the midwife if Verifi test was the same as the MaterniT21 test. She said yes, just different brands (Harmony and Panorama are two others, all offered by different labs), and that their office only works with the Verifi brand.

What I learned from calling the billing depts at both labs is this: Make sure they bill through insurance even if you know your claim will be denied. MaterniT21 lab charges two different fees: one for self-pay ($1500), and one if your insurance claim is denied ($200). Verifi lab charges the same price whether you pay yourself (self-pay) or whether you are denied through insurance, but they bill insurance $1500). I don't know about Harmony or Panorama.

If your insurance covers it, YMMV. With insurance my worst case scenario is paying $600 for either test. $600 = my $400 deductible plus a 20% co-pay (of the $1500 billed to insurance).

Also, expect you doctors office to ignore you completely. They *will not* help you with lab billing or insurance. My first OB told me it was necessary to do genetic testing, and that its usually covered by insurance because of age. When I got an insurance denial for a $5k lab bill, I called the doc.

And my midwife office gave me the same runaround trying to figure out this prenatal screening business.",[],,t1_cp5ji0i,False,0,[],False,"<div class=""md""><p>My midwife said I had a choice of the Verifi blood test or the BUN test (which is the blood test plus a super ultrasound with a high risk doc consult - I think others call this the NT scan). </p>

<p>I am not high risk, nor do I have any medical history that would indicate necessity for this test. I AM over 35, which is one of the reasons listed under medical necessity.</p>

<p>I asked the midwife if Verifi test was the same as the MaterniT21 test. She said yes, just different brands (Harmony and Panorama are two others, all offered by different labs), and that their office only works with the Verifi brand.</p>

<p>What I learned from calling the billing depts at both labs is this: Make sure they bill through insurance even if you know your claim will be denied. MaterniT21 lab charges two different fees: one for self-pay ($1500), and one if your insurance claim is denied ($200). Verifi lab charges the same price whether you pay yourself (self-pay) or whether you are denied through insurance, but they bill insurance $1500). I don&#39;t know about Harmony or Panorama.</p>

<p>If your insurance covers it, YMMV. With insurance my worst case scenario is paying $600 for either test. $600 = my $400 deductible plus a 20% co-pay (of the $1500 billed to insurance).</p>

<p>Also, expect you doctors office to ignore you completely. They <em>will not</em> help you with lab billing or insurance. My first OB told me it was necessary to do genetic testing, and that its usually covered by insurance because of age. When I got an insurance denial for a $5k lab bill, I called the doc. They told me I had to call lab billing. the end. The lab appealed my insurance company <em>three</em> times. Denied each time. This was for testing 3 pregnancies ago in July. I still haven&#39;t received a bill from the lab (hoping they took pity on me).</p>

I'm worrying about the decisions right now, not the outcome of the screening.

I am over 35, so I was offered noninvasive prenatal screening. My provider only offers the Verifi test. Verinata lab bills you $795 if your insurance denies the claim for the Verifi test.

I called insurance, and confirmed that the list of diagnosis codes approved for the procedure includes ""advanced maternal age"" among others, and this was the medical reason I was given for being offered the test. However, I am skeptical that insurance will cover this test. I may be being irrational here, but I've been screwed by them before. I know insurance doesn't look kindly on these screening tests (though the tide may have turned in the last year or two).

The MaterniT21 test lab bills you $200 if your insurance denies the claim. The representative in billing said that advanced maternal age is a legitimate diagnosis code, and she's seen it covered with my insurance.

My decision:
Do I get the Verifi test with my established provider, and assume insurance will accept the ""I'm old"" diagnosis code (and possibly get a $795 bill), OR do I try to get an appointment with an OB who offers MaterniT21, and take on the added costs of finding a new, temporary doc?

Am I making this more complicated than it needs to be?

I'm definitely getting the screening, though I don't know what I will do with results.

Funny, definitely-not-boring story:

I lied and said I was going to the gym, but really I went shopping and got a digital pregnancy test for him to use Saturday morning (I'm sure little lines will confuse him, he's my special love). And they had a sale on prenatal vitamins, so I was all oooooh. So I grab those then realise I have to hide them until Saturday. Then I throw away the receipt. Then panic because he might look up the charge to debit and see I went shopping. So then I go back in to buy random items with cash, go back to the car, shove them all in the same bag, toss the receipt. 

I then realise I have to waste forty minutes as I'm supposed to be working out. So I go to the beer store to pick him up his beer and waste time telling the cashier about my predicament and bore her ear off. But then I realise he'll see the time on the receipt if he checks that (why would he? I have no idea). So I drive around looking for a garbage can and tossed that. Then panic over the timestamp if he checks online. Had a nap in the car  in the parking lot, then on the way home realise *I could have just hidden it all in my gym bag*. And that now I have to explain how I shopped and got beer and worked out. So I make up all these scenarios based on what he asks when I get home.

I come home and am all ""Heyyyyyy!!! I was *so* tired after cardio, so I left early and I ran super quick to the store to get HAIRSPRAY. See?! Look it's hairspray. Neat, huh. And look, shiny beer. Here's a beer. Kay gonna put this hairspray and stuff in the bathroom for five minutes.""
