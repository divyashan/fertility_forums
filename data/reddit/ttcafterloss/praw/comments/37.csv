Being a new member of this thread, i feel it'll help document my healing if I have somewhere to post continuous updates. 
I feel as if, since i didnt get to leave the hospital with my baby, and now have to plan his burial, that I just want to have a baby in my arms. I dislike going to public places because Kids are everywhere. Especially with the warm awkward weather we've been having in my state. Spring seems like the time that everyone has decided to have one, and I want mine here, but i know that the decision that my husband and I made was the best for him, and that he is beautiful and healthy in heaven.
I was surprised with the amount of drama that my pregnancy brought into my family, specifically caused by my side of the family, more specifically my mother. Everything has been a fight with her, including where we wanted to have my son's ashes Interred at. She wanted to try to split his ashes so that she could have some, and that was a huge NO GO with everyone except for her. Our choice to take him off of his ventilator was a fight, and now the date of his burial is a fight. I had to cry and beg her to move the date up because I was not going to wait a month to put him to rest. It was just too long for me, and was only going to make healing harder. 
I had to make the poster boards for his burial last night, and looking at the pictures of him helped me to notice how beautiful he truly was. Of course i saw his beauty when he was born, but just being able to remember him, and see my husband and I made him, was just a truly heartwarming but heartbreaking moment. I miss him so much.
I'm just glad he is healthy and no longer in pain. I'm hoping that the healing process progresses like it should. But at the same time I feel like I'm trying to rush it. Is that a bad thing?",[],,t1_dee7scr,False,0,[],False,"<div class=""md""><p>[TW: Funeral Planning]

Like how I should look out for lithium batteries, and she has been practicing putting her e-cig in a different pocket so its not by the baby in case it explodes. Meanwhile, the snuza i got takes lithium batteries. She knows I have major anxiety and this stuff isn't helping. And she is all proud of herself for that. And that I shouldn't put the crib directly across from the window because a storm could blow the window in. WHAT? I could be more amenable to this advice if she took it herself. This weekend when setting up my baby shower she left scissors out where my nephew could easily get them, left beer in his reach, and left the door to the staircase to the basement wide open. But oh, don't let him play with a balloon supervised because it could pop and he could inhale latex. I'd be more open to these weird sitautional advices if she could like, hey maybe enact basic baby care 101 and not leave scissors and staircases unattended.

But I don&#39;t want her smoking around the baby, I want her to pay attention to real threats, not crazy storm blowing the window in .00001 threats, and I want her to do a full job instead of passing it off to someone else. Ugh. Sorry for the rant, I just had to rant somewhere. These are fine problems to have I guess, I know we hear about truly awful parents and stuff like that on here. </p>

I pretty much knew it because I have had none of my normal early pregnancy symptoms (mainly lots of creamy yellow CM and weird vivid dreams). It's 9DPO and I would normally have a faint positive by now if I were pregnant and so far stark white negatives. I also had a faint smidge of brown in my CM today so I'll most likely start my period tomorrow. Oh well here's to better luck next month I guess!



Edit: Well I guess I spoke to soon. After not starting my period or having any spotting on 10dpo I took another test that afternoon and it was positive! I thought for sure when I took the test that it would be negative because that morning my temp dropped to the coverline but low and behold it was positive and I absolutely freaked out! I was just walking around the house crying mumbling to myself about how I was sure it was going to be negative and couldn't believe it was positive.

I pretty much knew it because I have had none of my normal early pregnancy symptoms (mainly lots of creamy yellow CM and weird vivid dreams). It&#39;s 9DPO and I would normally have a faint positive by now if I were pregnant and so far stark white negatives. I also had a faint smidge of brown in my CM today so I&#39;ll most likely start my period tomorrow. Oh well here&#39;s to better luck next month I guess!</p>

<p>Edit: Well I guess I spoke to soon. After not starting my period or having any spotting on 10dpo I took another test that afternoon and it was positive! I thought for sure when I took the test that it would be negative because that morning my temp dropped to the coverline but low and behold it was positive and I absolutely freaked out! I was just walking around the house crying mumbling to myself about how I was sure it was going to be negative and couldn&#39;t believe it was positive.

I've never been happier to be called ""unremarkable"".


So, I guess I can cross uterine abnormalities off my long list of possible causes.
If they can't find anything wrong with me, what will I do then? Keep trying I guess, and hope that next time the egg & sperm actually make a viable baby. But that's so, so much easier said than done as we all know...

One thing that's been on my mind lately is that my sister has had 1 healthy child and then 2 miscarriages, and my first pregnancy ended in miscarriage. We're identical twins so I'm just wondering if we are going to be more prone to recurrent miscarriage because we have 3 between us, and genetically we are the same. I just keep trying to remind myself that we are individuals and pregnancy is different for each woman and that the next pregnancy (for either of us) is not doomed to fail.

Miscarriage is just fucking terrible. =/ 

I think my Missed Miscarriage was worse for me than my others, as I felt like I should have KNOWN. Our boys heart had stopped 3+ weeks before and I felt guilty and terrible for not knowing...how could I not notice? But that isn't true - its incredibly common and there is little you could have known or done. And I also thought my body was a failure...can't keep a baby alive and can't miscarry naturally, either. But that is also common and nothing you did wrong. 

YOU DID NOT FAIL HIM. <3

I'm sorry you're deep in the trenches today. I am also facing the possibility of not being able to experience motherhood, so I can relate to the pain and sorrow it causes to think that way. To look at your future and not see it pan out the way you had hoped. But for now, you just need to survive -- one minute at a time...then one hour at a time...then a day at a time. You need to grieve and take care of yourself. It takes time and its hard, but please talk to someone if you feel yourself slipping. Fortunately (and unfortunately?), life DOES go on and we have to learn to move forward without our babies however we can. It's not easy, but you've survived already -- that's amazing and strong and YOU GOT THIS.  

Thinking of you! HUGS!

How quickly your HCG 0's out depends on many factors, a couple being how high it was and how far along you were at the time.

That schedule is ridiculous and I am in shock a doctor recommended this. This was your OB!?!?!?  Honestly, with that tidbit alone, I'd suggest a new doctor.

First of all, that assumes you don't ovulate until ~CD17 or so...which is unlikely but also completely unknown. AND could mean only hitting 3 of the 5 fertile days, even if you did ovulate then. Without tracking your cycles (do you?) you don't know this. And your first cycle after a MC you can't really know anyway.  And having sex only after you ovulate is NOT the way to conceive. Your doctor has no idea when your fertile days ARE and is suggesting this without the necessary information.

Has your husband had a Sperm Analysis? Without that information its irresponsible and totally guesswork for your OB to suggest abstinence for your husband. 

ALSO, and this is the big one: it is a common misconception that abstinence will save sperm in attempts to increase sperm count as well as the likelihood of conception. In fact, studies show that abstinence actually holds no benefits for couples that have normal fertility levels. Some studies claim that delaying ejaculation *might* increase the volume and concentration of sperm. However, infrequent ejaculation as a result of abstinence can *impair the percentage of normal sperm and motile sperm*. That's terrible for conception and embryo health. Abstinence is largely irrelevant for normal couples, but men with low sperm counts should actually NOT abstain for more than one or two days prior to intercourse. 

Again - do you track your cycles? If so, you likely know your normal cycle (if you have a regular one). 

I'd suggest attempting sex whenever you really want until you know you're in the fertile period (typically 3 days before O, ovulation day, and the next day). Then I'd do it AT LEAST every other day but I like to hit at least 4 of those days, for my own peace of mind.  Knowing your fertile days depends on quite a bit of information, so if you don't know, on CD10 I'd start having sex every other day at a minimum, to not miss the fertile window.

My bakery participates in 2 big, expensive events each year run by the same organization. The first one doesn't make a ton of money, but it's worth it to get some costs covered for the second one, which is huge. But if I'm not doing the second one there's really no point in doing the first either. It's a little complicated but it has to do with permit costs for the year and such. 

The second event is immediately before my due date. It's an event that I almost certainly can't do heavily pregnant, even with a lot of help and one that I absolutely certainly can't do if I am in labor or if something has gone wrong with the pregnancy. And it's expensive so I can't sign up and risk not being able to go.

The deadline for early payment for the first event (which is a massive reduction in cost and I probably can't afford it if I wait until after tomorrow) is tomorrow.

So by not signing up I am taking a big risk counting on this pregnancy to last, which is terrifying. But at the same time it's a LOT of money and time lost if the pregnancy does last. My husband and I decided that we would wait until the last second to decide for sure, but that if I got pregnant this cycle we wouldn't do the events and we'd take that risk. Still scary. I haven't even gotten to my missed period yet (and won't until after that deadline tomorrow).

All of that to say that this morning I got a very blunt and rude message from someone I really, really don't like (who unless her volunteer position has drastically changed, shouldn't even have access to these lists before the deadline) saying something along the lines of ""you didn't register. are you going to?""

If it were one of the other organizers of the event that I actually like, I don't know if I'd give the full story but I'd be comfortable being a little more open. But I don't even know what to say. I want to say ""the final deadline isn't until the end of next month. You'll know by then"" but I also know that's rude. 

Sorry for my petty rant. I am overthinking and panicking about everything and probably need to get my ass to a therapist before this pregnancy sends me spiraling into some sort of awful disaster.

More information on this panel can be seen here: http://www.questdiagnostics.com/testcenter/testguide.action%3Fdc%3DTS_Recurrent_Miscarriage <- This is the medical standard for most substantiated clinical causes of miscarriage. Some of the tests do require a second test later, upon first positive, to verify status.

I do want to stress that 60% of all first trimester losses are due to aneuploidy, which is an error in the meosis process (sperm meeting egg and swapping dna) where there are 45 or 47 chromosomes in the conceptus instead of the usual 46. The loss of these types of embryos are, unfortunately, unavoidable and are typically not caused by any biological influence. It is the body's way of recognizing when a fertilized embryo is abnormal and stopping it from going any further. Genetic problems like translocation in couples experiencing recurrent loss is actually quite rare, only effecting about 3% of women with recurrent loss. So, for the vast majority of us who miscarry in the first trimester, it's like drawing the 1 bad card out of 4. Sometimes more than once.

The website you listed seems to have a lot of things on it that aren't totally accepted as gospel by the ob medical community yet. It takes a long time to ""prove"" that an intervention works on miscarriage, and studies take years to complete. All fertility specialists will boast a success rate of 80%... and that is actually because, even without intervention in many cases, recurrent miscarriage studies have shown that women do eventually carry to term 70-80% of the time (depending on the participant group size) as long as they keep trying to get pregnant. Though I agree it is always worth it to rule out the most substantiated causes with simple blood tests and maybe a uterine ultrasound to rule out mullerian defects like a septum, fibroids, polyps, bicornurate uterus, etc (and these defects take a comparably smaller piece of the blame than chromosomes and antibody/clotting issues). Also, only half of all women with recurrent loss ever find a medical diagnosis to explain them.

It's a good rule of thumb to google search the ncbi.nlm.nih.gov studies if you come across any explanation or treatment, to see how strong the correlation is. There is a lot of misinformation out there and websites can more or less publish whatever statistics they want, and I have seen lots of really bad numbers out there in very popular and widely-read sources. Methods of treatment for recurrent loss like steroid use (which many websites still recommend) is viewed with skepticism by the wider ob community, even though some doctors use it. The blocking antibodies theory that a couple can be ""too alike"" genetically, so the woman must receive paternal white cell immunizations (having the white blood cells of her husband injected into her body) is actually associated with MORE misacarriages, not less, and yet this method is still in practice today by some professionals. So, it's a bit of a muddy pool. People will throw anything they can to see if it ""sticks"", and if they arrive at a 70-80% success rate they will assume they have found the answer, when in reality that is the normal rate for women with several losses.

I want to emphasize that as painful as it is to go through, having one loss is very normal and your experience is shared by millions of others going through the same thing. Unfortunately we live in a society that pushes it under the rug, so when it happens we feel blindsided and totally unprepared, and it's devastating. It is really good that you're being pro-active and getting tested now! I hope you are able to find helpful answers!

PS: As far as the ANA diagnosis is concerned, you'll have to pursue that with your doctor to verify the condition and I think this can be managed with blood thinners, but your Doc will be able to guide you through your next pregnancy if you do indeed have the disorder. Good luck!

Doubling time of like ~33 hours. Such a huge sigh of relief when the midwife called me back with the results today. 

They aren't ordering any more blood work. Now I just sit and wait until the u/s on 3/6. Last night with my therapist we played out both scenarios of taking home a pregnancy and having another miscarriage and that was incredibly helpful. She also showed me a breathing/meditation technique focusing on an energy path from your pelvis to your head and back down and around your uterus twice. It sounds super weird but I did it all last night and it was very calming. And my uterus felt ""full"" this morning which probably sounds crazy. My therapist leans into the woo-woo and I'm not really there but I'm willing to try anything. I can try to better explain the breathing thing if anyone else is into it.

Well I got to the airport early on Wednesday. I found a bank of comfy chairs and chilled out. And then a guy and his baby sat right across from me, and baby's grandmother right next to me, despite there being tons of empty chairs around. So he starts feeding the baby and the grandmother starts making kissy noises. The baby starts fussing, then more of their family show up and are crowded right around me. Not a great start.

I got on the plane and there was a man who took my seat, so I offered to take his. It was next to his 14 yo son who smelled like he needed a shower and kept farting in his sleep. Then guess who shows up in the row in front of me but the big family with the baby! Out of 451 people on the plane, that's where they ended up!! Fuck. Headphones in.

We landed late but I made my first train. There were really high winds though, and a tree fell on the tracks so I ended up in some station in the middle of nowhere. After waiting an hour, we heard an announcement that ground transportation was being arranged! Yay. 

Then a bus arrived and an announcement said that only 57 spots on the bus. I quickly grabbed my luggage and joined the queue, but I was JUST after the cutoff. I asked the conductor if he could help as I had an important doctors appointment and he said I could ask ppl in the line if I wanted to but ""everyone has somewhere they need to be."" I started crying. I'm sure people thought I was crazy.

Then I had to wait out in the wind for the next bus, as there was no way I was risking going back to the train and missing it. The conductor decided to hand out meal vouchers on the train but I didn't get one bc I stood in the cold for another half hour just waiting and crying. Finally he comes over to us at the bus stop and says that there isn't another bus coming but we should walk 10 mins up the road to another train station to connect there. 

I freaked out, saying ""I have 23kg of luggage!"" and start crying again because I know I will miss the appointment by now. He said that was the best they could do, and I asked why I can't have a normal taxi. He said they weren't authorised for normal taxis and I said I can't carry my luggage to another station on my own and he said I was welcome to wait on the train for ground transport but there would be no guarantee that it would come. 

I said it was unacceptable, that I'd been travelling for 16 hours and asked what they would do if someone had special needs. He asked if I had special needs with a tone in his voice that I didn't appreciate. I felt like shouting out all my symptoms but realised I was getting nowhere and just making a scene for nothing.

My husband texted me immediately ""where are you?"" and left work to come and pick me up two hours away. I went into the nearest pub to get myself a gin and tonic and cried and rescheduled my appointment. By the time I got home last night, the sun was setting (I'd seen it rise that morning from the plane!).

Today, I am paying for it. My symptoms are worse - probably the stress and the gin and tonic combined. And a new symptom: full body trembles which I think was low blood sugar from not eating. Sigh. Oh and now we have to wait two more weeks for answers.

Obviously, I'll be happy if she can stick around in there for another couple of weeks, but I've been hoping all along for her to come a couple of days before she's due at least, because she's due on the anniversary of my loss and I don't know if I'll be able to cope with all the emotions on that day AND being pregnant.

When we conceived in October, I was so excited! But I had one friend I knew had been trying for years and had suffered several losses. I was terrified to tell her because our pregnancy wasn't very planned. I approached her and told her that I would meet here where she was and share what she wanted to know but would let her decide how much she wanted to know and when. She wrote me a lovely letter explaining that she was genuinely excited and felt that it was up to her to manage her grief, and not up to me to modulate my excitement. However, she appreciated my sensitivity and felt it made it so much easier to be honest with me about how she felt.

So when I suffered my loss, I took her lead and decided to make a choice to 1) be honest about my grief with my pregnant friends 2) be honest about what I could and couldn't handle. I just basically said that I was really struggling with my loss, and even though I was out of the game I was still a fan and wanted to support however I could, but please understand it might be a little limited for a while until I was feeling better. 

Because with time it did get easier for me to be happy for others and with time, I did get genuinely excited for the fruit sizes and the test results. 

So that's just me and how I handled it. I think other posters have given some very sensitive and honest ways you could address this with your sister. People who haven't been through this just truly don't understand.

I often comment on how most of the well known loss stories, books, and portrayals in tv/movies always have a happy ending...they get the child they so badly wanted. But what about the other side? What if we do have to give up and stop? I just don't know. Sounds terrible, but its something I need to consider.

How do I deal with the urge to keep trying? I keep trying. I take small breaks when I physically or emotionally need to, but I keep chugging along. Maybe its not the best answer...maybe its not helping my pain...but I need to do it.

Gus passed his NST with flying colors.  They think that the pain was muscoskeletal (basically RLP), which seems crazy.  I've had RLP this entire pregnancy and this was so much worse.  Oh well, at least I know now that it doesn't appear to impact him.

Let her know how much you love her and how much you look forward to being there for your niece/nephew. And that you know she only wants to share her joy with you out of a sense of love. Then maybe say that you also are experiencing a depth of sadness and struggle that you have a hard time expressing, and it means that hearing these day to day updates are really hard for you. Close with something about hoping that knowing how much she cares for you that she can also support you by trying to understand why you can&#39;t be the one with whom she shares this kind of thing, as much as you&#39;d like to be.</p>

<p>Whatever you do - written, verbal; in any difficult conversation it helps to avoid saying &quot;but,&quot; in place use &quot;and.&quot; The book <a href=""https://www.amazon.com/Difficult-Conversations-Discuss-What-Matters/dp/014028852X/ref=pd_sbs_14_t_2?_encoding=UTF8&amp;psc=1&amp;refRID=0RR09AQAB08VJ286Z0MC"">Difficult Conversations</a> helped me with feeling more confident about how to address this kind of thing in my personal and professional life, that was one point that stuck. I read it while earning my principal licensure, but I swear I used it more with dealing with my MIL!</p>

I&#39;m so uncomfortable but am grateful to be here at all. Last night baby was waaay up in my lungs and while it meant he was moving and ok, it was so painful and actually making me anxious since it restricted my breathing. But I kept saying it&#39;s better then not feeling him. He&#39;s lower today and super bouncy, so yay. I get that pelvic pain and rolling over pain too. I see a PT for it, some tips she gave me are keep knees together when you can, smaller steps when walking, take big stairs one at a time, and try to roll like a log with your legs together. I also wear a pregnancy belt very low. Your massage will help I got one last weekend I felt amazing for like 3 days before the pain returned.</p>

<p>And girl your sex life is ahead of mine lol. Nothing for us since... 28 weeks ish and we didn&#39;t finish because I was so uncomfortable and that&#39;s not exactly a turn on for him.

Friday we needed to clean and run errands for our party the next day. But...someone invited us for after work drinks at one of our favorite places and we were like ""Sure!""...oops? So we went out with them, and ended up even ordering dinner there and staying out a bit later than we thought. THEN we came home and were going to do a few things to get started, but my husband's bff messaged and asked if he could stop by and borrow something. He was on a date with this new girl (like, 6th date) and he brought her over...we started chatting and hanging out and had some beers...and then somehow we all decided to hot tub. So we were hot tubbing/hanging out and and stayed up too late...and got NO chores done.  Mid-way through hot tubbing, I remembered (oops!) that my cousin might be stopping by the next day...and we'd be interrupted in our preparations for a couple hours. YIKES.

So Saturday we start crazily cleaning and preparing. Our house was a mess - I'd been sick, his work has been crazy, and we remodel all the time. So there was a LOT of prep work to do. In the middle of this, my cousin DOES stop by. He and his wife and children were moving from Washington DC to Texas and we're on the route...and we hadn't seen each other in a few YEARS. So we basically had a 2.5-3 hour break where we got lunch and hung out..and they got to see our house and meet our pets. It was so nice!! But stressed me out a lot, too, as it made us more rushed. Then we got groceries, picked up the keg, finished up a few things, and I had to rush to get ready! It was a formal party, so I had to try to look nice...I had 45 minutes to shower, dry my hair, do makeup, figure out what I was actually wearing, and be ready when people started showing up. [I think I accomplished that, and even got my dog dressed up! hehe](http://imgur.com/a/klocI)  

We had 37 people at the party...toons of delicious foods, lots of good booze, great conversations. It was 70 degrees til like 9 pm so we had windows and doors open and some people hung out on the deck. We played some games, even a VR game. I was up till 3 in the morning and then up again at 8. So yeah...last to bed and first up. Eek. But it was a blast. 3 of our friends stayed the night (this was planned).

Then Sunday we had our running club, and each week someone is in charge of the trail and drinks/food for it -- that was us this week. So we spent a lot of our day doing that - getting food/drinks/ice and preparing a trail, then running it. But it was 74 degrees and amazing.  After trail people often go out for food and stuff...but instead ~10 people came to our house and we ordered pizza and people hot tubbed again. haha So I was up super late again. Eek.

But I also ended up talking to one of the runners who knew about MY losses, but...had 3 of her own. Later ones. Had infertility, ended up finally pregnant and had ad baby. Then had a 24 week, a 20 week, and a 15 week loss. In a row. Stopped trying after that. It was an emotional and crazy good talk. Her losses were 20 years ago and you could still FEEL the pain. So that was tough but a good reminder that my grief is real. 

So...like I said...crazy, long, and fun. So good to let loose and enjoy myself even if hosting was a lot of work.

Spent the weekend in DC, walked 8.5 miles on Saturday and my nausea totally behaved itself and only got bad right as I was laying down to bed each night and during the car ride home. (I was with my MIL and she doesn't know.)

I never went for the blood draw they ordered in October due to miscarrying too fast, so they were able to use that one. Now I have to call the midwives and make sure they send over one for Wednesday and also see when I can get my <a href=""/u/s"">u/s</a> so I can schedule that. </p>

<p>Spent the weekend in DC, walked 8.5 miles on Saturday and my nausea totally behaved itself and only got bad right as I was laying down to bed each night and during the car ride home. (I was with my MIL and she doesn&#39;t know.) </p>

Been feeling a bit better which of course has me worried, but we spent the weekend at my in laws house and I took a 3 hour nap yesterday (TW LC: huge luxury w a toddler!!) and also we went out to eat a lot and I actually ate some protein, so I'm thinking that's why.

When you were taking the pregnancy tests, was your urine diluted at all? There's a possibility that the tests weren't done with a long/ concentrated enough hold, so the lines weren't showing up.

It was just a routine check up and I didn't have any signs I was having a miscarriage or the baby died in the past 12 days since my last ultrasound, so I think it is considered a missed miscarriage. I went to MFM to get a scan at 13w 6d and everything was fine. The baby was measuring a little small, almost a week behind by measurements, but they said I didn't need to worry because the difference between my OB's measurements and theirs was likely just a measurement error during the early weeks.

Cue 12 days later and there is no heartbeat, so I guess I should have been worrying. Almost a week later, I opted for the misoprostol and we did the whole procedure in the hospital. The hardest part about doing it in the hospital is that they used all the same terms for delivering my miscarriage as if I was delivering a healthy baby. I know they were just doing their jobs, but it's sucked. ""Oh, you're water just broke. The baby is coming, it's time to push a little."" I felt like I was actually giving birth, but I didn't get a baby to show for it. And the placenta didn't even detach so I had to have the d&c anyways.

Before I got to the hospital I was so relieved to finally be getting the baby out of me, but I felt so guilty for feeling that way. My baby was silently born on 2/15/17 at 9:18 am. S/he was 4.5 inches long and only weight 21g. My husband and I chose not to see the baby. I didn't think I could handle seeing it's poor little lifeless body. I sometimes wonder if that makes me a horrible person. I just don't think I could handle seeing it, or finding out the sex, or naming it, but I see other people doing that and I feel like I messed up.

Now that it's over and I'm recovering I just feel so empty. That constant presence of my little bean is gone. I feel like a failure and every cramp and sign of bleeding just reminds me of that failure. 

So now we have to wait 6 weeks before we can have sex again to avoid the risk of infection. It's hard because I want to start trying again immediately, but also because I don't want this to hurt my relationship with me husband. He has been great through this whole ordeal and I love him, but I know it affects me differently. Physical contact and sex is an important aspect of a healthy marriage, but there is very little I can do at this time; my body needs time to heal. We aren't currently having marital problems, but I'd prefer to be proactive about it. So we are trying to plan date nights again. Hopefully it will help make these next 6 weeks as we wait to try again go by faster.

I don&#39;t want to say it&#39;ll get better bc do we know that? I hope you find other joys in your life to distract from this. That&#39;s all I&#39;m trying to do right now. </p>

For me and others that I've read about on here, I don't know that it stops, but the waves come further and further apart with time and are sometimes easier to see ""coming"" since you start to understand what can signal your grief. 

For me the first week was SO HARD. Your body is still trying to understand and adjust with you. I remember that week if I could sleep when I would wake up, I would ""remember"" the loss all over again, and just bawl. 

There may be triggers that remind you of your loss or those special and precious 6 weeks you had. I had an early loss and I cherish even the barely 3 weeks that I knew I was pregnant, but I can also think about it again if something reminds me of those 3 weeks (a recipe my husband invented for me in that time, a baby cookbook I found at a thrift store a few days after I found out, etc.). 

Time can give you more perspective and some distance, but some of the grief may always be there in some form or another. I think maybe sometimes it's about making sure the ""form"" is one that helps you feel better.

I had an early loss and I cherish even the barely 3 weeks that I knew I was pregnant, but I can also think about it again if something reminds me of those 3 weeks (a recipe my husband invented for me in that time, a baby cookbook I found at a thrift store a few days after I found out, etc.). </p>

<p>Time can give you more perspective and some distance, but some of the grief may always be there in some form or another. I think maybe sometimes it&#39;s about making sure the &quot;form&quot; is one that helps you feel better.</p>

We like Valentine's Day and our relationship is pretty fucking great.  So I don't care if I'm annoying but if I could scream to the whole damn world how much I love my husband I would. 
Regardless, I had a quiet day to myself, went and got some studying done. Relaxed. 
I woke up this morning with a splitting headache and a lot of nausea. Had to drink like 2 bottles of water, eat and have coffee, alongside with some ibuprofen 800. 
I have work later so hoping to feel like myself when I get there.
I don't feel as bad as I felt the first week my husband was gone! So that's a definite plus! I hope all of you have a wonderful day!

I do have the option of consulting with a different GP.

Back in the early 2000's I was best friends with two other girls. We were in our early 20's and living in Hollywood, going out nearly every night. After a few years we parted ways, because no one lives there forever, it's exhausting. I moved to the suburbs of LA, another went back to New England, and the last went back to the South. I lost touch with the southern one, and hadn't heard much about her other than secondhand news from our new england friend. A week and a half ago my friend from the south died. Suspicious circumstances they say. Her funeral is here this week. Our other friend isn't able to make it here on such short notice. I was really hoping she'd be able to make it, so that I would have someone there that knew her AND liked her. In lieu of that I'm bringing my husband, who knew her but only knew her at her worst. 

I feel guilty for losing touch. I feel like a shit friend for not making the effort to maintain that friendship. But it was also really hard to be her friend sometimes. She had a serious drug problem, which she did eventually kick. Initially we all thought that she had overdosed. And we were kind of pissed off at her for that. After all these years of going to NA meetings with her, talking her down off of rooftops, calling 911 when she was suicidal... Everything was for nothing. We felt like we had only delayed the inevitable. Of course it turns out that it wasn't an overdose. I don't really know how to process this. I don't know the circumstances behind it, all I know is that it wasn't her choice. I just really hope that it was quick, that it didn't hurt, and that she wasn't scared. But how could she not have been scared? Even with all her faults, no one deserves that. 

And to top all that off with a totally superficial complaint, I have nothing to wear because I'm starting to get gigantic at 16 weeks. But, bearing in mind that she would be pissed if I wore yoga pants to her funeral, I have to find something decent to respect that. 

This just all sucks so fucking much. ",[],,t1_ddqrilw,False,0,[],False,"<div class=""md""><p>TW: death/funeral</p>

Ha!) takes 2 loss or one loss later than 11 weeks to be seen. 

I don't feel to bad other than hating wearing pads and being suspicious that it's not necessary. I don't really understand why it is that one can use diva cups for menstruating but not for miscarriage. 

EDIT:

Okay.... Saw my GP who specializes in pregnancy. Highly unsatisfying. I have a requisition for one blood order. So in 10 days I'm to go get my blood checked to see if there's any HCG left. Not serial, just one. Okay fine. Admittedly it's pretty unlikely that I have a rogue ectopic pregnancy that's causing me no pain, but this 10 days after blood work is no different than last loss.

She said ""call early next time, we'll get you in early for ultrasound, AND bloodwork."" Proceeded to tell me how marvelous bloodwork is. Uh huh. I told her it took me 4 weeks to get an appointment with her, is that going to change? (No, of course not)

2 miscarriages in a row is just unlucky..... eetc etc etc. 

You know who consistently feeds me the most bullshit regarding miscarriages? It's my GP.


Anyways, it was unsatisfying and I regret summoning any optimism for the appointment.

My wife and I tried for four years to conceive for the first time and in Nov 2014 my wife got pregnant catching us totally by surprise. Found out we were having a boy and named him Walker.

We tried for another eleven months to conceive again and went through four failed Clomid cycles, an HSG, RE consults, and were on the verge of giving up when she conceived again. She received a cerclage at 14 weeks and started vaginal progesterone at 15 weeks. It was a very scary, risky pregnancy (she has PCOS and developed GD, the cerclage caused LOTS of contractions from 32 weeks on) but our second son was delivered healthy and happy in Oct 2016 at 39 weeks.

I wanted to share this story so that you know that it is possible for success after a loss due to incompetent cervix. I am so sorry for your loss, but if you conceive again there is absolutely a lot that can be done to help increase the chances that you can carry to term.

I did know, I knew from the day i got pregnant that something didn't feel right. I knew everytime i had a good ultrasound or blood test that i wasn't bringing a baby home. I knew as I was laying down to sleep the night before i was supposed to be induced that something was going to happen and I wasn't bringing this baby home... When i stopped feeling movement, which I was hyper conscious of, I went to L&D right away. He still died. These things happen for no good reason, despite our best efforts. My brother and I were toying with the idea of creating a discrete monitor for pregnant ladies to wear 24/7 that would tell them the second the baby's heart rate dropped. The thing is, even if you are aware of it happening as its happening, there is nothing you could do. If the chord is being pinched or the baby isn't getting oxygen for whatever reason, after only 10 minutes the baby is clinically brain dead.
I'm so sorry you are in pain. That feeling of guilt is probably just a coping mechanism.  Mine is a fear that other people I love are going to die too. Its a way of trying to feel in control for me.

I did know, I knew from the day i got pregnant that something didn&#39;t feel right. I knew everytime i had a good ultrasound or blood test that i wasn&#39;t bringing a baby home. I knew as I was laying down to sleep the night before i was supposed to be induced that something was going to happen and I wasn&#39;t bringing this baby home... When i stopped feeling movement, which I was hyper conscious of, I went to L&amp;D right away. He still died. These things happen for no good reason, despite our best efforts. My brother and I were toying with the idea of creating a discrete monitor for pregnant ladies to wear 24/7 that would tell them the second the baby&#39;s heart rate dropped. The thing is, even if you are aware of it happening as its happening, there is nothing you could do. If the chord is being pinched or the baby isn&#39;t getting oxygen for whatever reason, after only 10 minutes the baby is clinically brain dead.
I&#39;m so sorry you are in pain. That feeling of guilt is probably just a coping mechanism.  Mine is a fear that other people I love are going to die too. Its a way of trying to feel in control for me. Maybe by feeling guilty your brain is trying to hold on to control, like if you feel guilty that means there is more you could have done which means you weren&#39;t out of control you just dropped the ball. Its so hard to filter through all this grief and figure out whats serving us and whats not. I wish you all the comfort during this horribly difficult time.</p>

If I don&#39;t drag him by the teeth he won&#39;t get up at all for another hour or two. He simply doesn&#39;t care that he committed to do something.) But it makes no difference. I worry this is only going to become more frustrating once there is a child to take care of, so I&#39;m trying to make some progress before we get to that point.</p>

One coworker even gestured toward my belly and cautiously said &quot;...soooo what&#39;s up with you?&quot;  I am surprisingly ok with it.  Whatever happens, happens; and I&#39;m just taking it a day at a time, and suddenly I&#39;m 20 weeks along and everything is ok.</p>

They wouldn't do any tests on me and my husband until we had 3 losses.

So, maybe you can ask for a saline ultrasound or pelvic MRI (I had both to confirm diagnosis). We also had the first fetus tested and are awaiting results on the most recent as well.

They'll have to correct my uterine anomaly with surgery in a few months and hopefully have a successful pregnancy next time.

This might be a bit rambly, but I just... wanted to get this out.  I can't talk to my friends or family about this because they don't know about the pregnancy/miscarriage, and I don't intend to let them know because I don't want a pity party.

Got married end of April 2016, husband and I decided to wait until earliest end of 2016 before we actively start trying so we can enjoy being newly married without contending with a pregnancy/baby.  November arrived and my husband was keen to start trying, but I wasn't quite ready to be pregnant yet.  We are both 34 so the biological clock is really ticking, but I insisted and we postponed until January 2017.  Lo and behold our first month trying I get a positive test (this was last week).  I was shocked that it happened right away, but super happy, and we joked about how our schedule was pushed up by several months.  We had previously agreed to not tell anyone until at least after week 12, but were already discussing how we'd go announcing the pregnancy.

That lasted all of about a week when this Tuesday I start bleeding and on Wednesday had really strong cramps while my uterus proceeded to empty itself.  The cramps themselves weren't too bad, but whatever was going on totally made my legs felt like jelly and I felt I couldn't stand up.  I read that tampons can increase the risk of infections during a miscarriage -- might really apply to later miscarriages -- so I used pads to be safe.  So in addition to cramps and feeling sad, I had to deal with squishy clotted blood sloshing around between my labia lips for three days and changing a blood-soaked pad 2-3 times a day.  I went through three or four rolls of toilet paper because everything that would have previously been contained with an ultra absorbency tampon was just smearing all over my lady bits.  Fortunately the bleeding tapered off as of yesterday evening and seems to be mostly done today.  It was, in the end, pretty much just like a normal period but a week late and with strength-sapping cramps.  Funnily this morning my husband came out of the shower just as I finished up on the toilet.  He saw that the toilet water was reddish and said, ""Wow that looks mighty bloody.""  I kinda laughed and told him if he thinks that's bloody, then he probably would have thought the last two days were a series of massacres.

Husband and I discussed when to try again, and we've agreed to wait until at least after my ob/gyn appt in two weeks in case she discovers any abnormalities that need to be addressed.   Hopefully everything will be back to normal in March and we can resume then.  I want to try again soon because I'm impatient, but I also don't want to try *too* soon, get pregnant, then have another miscarriage because my uterus was not in the appropriate condition to accept and support a fertilized egg.

This brings me back to my initial insistence to wait.  Honestly, I was never super excited about being a mother.  Pregnancy and all the things it does to a woman's body terrifies me.  I would have been happy being childfree and just enjoying life with my husband.  Even after I got the positive test my first thought was that now I need to be responsible for another human being, and getting sad over the fun childfree things I'd have to put on hold until the kids are older.  Then the bleeding started, I saw the brief playful-but-disappointed pout my husband gave when we realized the miscarriage was without a doubt underway, and... I feel so guilty.  I wish we had started trying in November like he had asked.  Maybe we still wouldn't have been successful until January and still would have had a miscarriage, but *what if*?  It's like within one week I went from, ""Oh no my fun adult life is *over*"" to ""I *really* want to have a child with my husband"".  Wtf is going on???
