They will take a history of you both, explain the costs and timeline of testing, and tell you to book in at the start of your next period.  My husband had to do semen analysis, and blood test  and i had 2 blood tests.  2 was a full panel, and the other was to test the age of my eggs (this one takes like 6 weeks).

The first ultrasound after your period start is an external and internal.  They will also likely do a sonohysterogram which flushes your uterus and will show and blockages in your tubes.  After that you go in every 3 days or so for an interal ultrasound as they measure your follicles.  They also do a blood test with each visit to measure your hormones.  The closer you get to ovulating the more often you go. I was going once a day the last couple days.

Once you spike (ovulate) they tell you to go home, and have sex the next few days.  You dont have your next appointment for 2 weeks when they test your thc.  Very stressful 2 weeks.

They will take a history of you both, explain the costs and timeline of testing, and tell you to book in at the start of your next period.  My husband had to do semen analysis, and blood test  and i had 2 blood tests.  2 was a full panel, and the other was to test the age of my eggs (this one takes like 6 weeks).</p>

<p>The first ultrasound after your period start is an external and internal.  They will also likely do a sonohysterogram which flushes your uterus and will show and blockages in your tubes.  After that you go in every 3 days or so for an interal ultrasound as they measure your follicles.  They also do a blood test with each visit to measure your hormones.  The closer you get to ovulating the more often you go. I was going once a day the last couple days.</p>

<p>Once you spike (ovulate) they tell you to go home, and have sex the next few days.  You dont have your next appointment for 2 weeks when they test your thc.  Very stressful 2 weeks.</p>

They‚Äôll put your legs in stirrups and strap your arms down. You probably won‚Äôt remember being put under anesthesia. 

They‚Äôll insert a foley to drain your urine and insert a breathing tube. The breathing tube can cause a sore throat if they use the one that goes down inside (ET tube) instead of the one that goes just to the back of the throat (LMA).

Usually your discharge instructions are no sex or tampons or anything up the vagina for 2 weeks. Sometimes they‚Äôll say no baths or swimming either. 

You can get pregnant ASAP but most doctors say it‚Äôs better to wait until the next cycle to give the endometrial lining some time to recover.

My doctor recommended two days of total rest, then two weeks of restricted activity from sex, exercise, heavy stress, etc.  She said we can start trying again if we want when the bleeding ends.

&#x200B;

Recovery on my first D&C was physically super easy with very little bleeding and no cramping.  I bled very lightly for three weeks, then a week of nothing, then the heaviest period I've ever had.  My cycles were also all over the place in terms of length and heaviness of bleeding for the following few months.  Emotionally, however, I really struggled.  Thankfully, my boss was incredibly understanding and let me take the time I needed; I ended up taking close to two weeks off work.  I kept a lot inside and didn't open up to my husband, family, or close friends much and that really isolated me in my own grief and made it very difficult to heal emotionally for the following months.

&#x200B;

My second D&C so far is a little different.  I've had much heavier bleeding and cramping, though nothing advil can't handle for now.  I've also been leaning on my husband much more and my close friends have offered whatever support I need.  I'm hoping this helps me heal emotionally quicker this time around.

&#x200B;

This is an incredibly difficult time, and I'm so sorry you're having to go through it; I wouldn't wish it on anyone.  I think anyone who goes through this comes out on the other side a different person, stronger maybe but also profoundly sad.  My advice would be to first take time just to focus on your recovery.  Take a handful of days off work (I'm likely taking a week off this time, again thanks to a very supporting and understanding boss that I know not everyone has).  Process your feelings - cry, vent, reach out to those who might understand what you are going through.  It's okay to feel sad for as long as you need.  Then step forward day by day and try to regain some normalcy in your life.  Keep a routine if that's what you need.  Take up an exercise habit; yoga was incredibly cathartic for me.

&#x200B;

I hope you have an easy recovery, and please feel free to reach out if you need it.  This is the first time I've posted in this sub but I've lurked since my first D&C and subsequent ttc journey and found it very helpful to read that I was not alone in what I was going through.

That said, I am so sorry to hear of your loss. <3 It's never easy. I had a blighted ovum that required medication to pass at 11.5 weeks back in September and my husband had no attachment whatsoever to the pregnancy since it was so early and it's not like he was feeling all the nausea or going to the appointments yet. I didn't feel too attached yet either, but the hardest part for me is the subsequent periods. I bled for 5 weeks when I got my first post m/c period, then each period after that has been devastating that I haven't gotten pregnant again yet.   I find it helpful to tell my husband that I just need to talk aloud about my feelings for a couple minutes and I need him to respond - you may want to try something like this, but let him know he doesn't need to talk about his feelings, only respond sympathetically or rephrasing what you said. Sometimes you just have to be direct about what you need in that moment and accept that he may never reciprocate in sharing his feelings about it.

I have been on antidepressants throughout my pregnancy with my now toddler and went to a maternal fetal medicine practitioner that gave the antidepressants basically a non-factor in any birth defects or negative effects on the pregnancy. There are some pills that are higher risk, but your GP can prescribe you something that has no known risks. I have chronic recurring depression, so going off meds would be more of a risk than any microscopic possible risk from the medications to the pregnancy.

I don't have experience with medications, but I can address your husband/grief problem with some personal experience. Our first pregnancy turned out to be identical twin boys, and my husband was TERRIFIED. He was anxious about having a baby at all, and when we found out it was twins at our 8 week ultrasound, he basically went into a months-long panic. They both died at 16 weeks due to a problem with their placenta, and while I was devastated my husband was... relieved. It was so hard for me to go through the loss of my first children and the hard grieving I needed to do afterward, knowing that my husband really wasn't grieving much. He did get a little sad now and then, but it was like a blip on the radar compared to my nuclear meltdown. I had a lot of resentment. On his part, he tried to be supportive but didn't totally understand what I was going through. The first six months following the loss were rough. I thought about leaving him. We did therapy. He never did grieve the way I did, but I've come to accept that. I think a lot (not all, but a lot) of men don't really have a strong connection to their babies until they're born. In my husband's case, there was also the factor that he missed all of our ultrasounds aside from the first one. I had seen our boys growing bigger and bigger and getting more and more active throughout the pregnancy, and I saw them dead on the ultrasound screen as well, and I think if he had seen all that, he might have grieved more, too. When I got pregnant again, we made sure he was at every single appointment. He didn't miss one, even the totally routine checkups, and that made the whole thing so much more real to him. But that's a side note. What I'm getting at is that men and women generally just grieve differently, and men often don't grieve as much as women do for unborn children. That can cause a lot of stress and strain on a marriage, and I think therapy is the best answer. It really helped me understand where he was coming from, and it helped him understand how deeply hurt I was both by the loss and his reaction to it. Ultimately, it made us stronger as a couple, and I think it made us both better, more patient and loving parents when we finally did have a living baby, but it took work. I'm so sorry for your loss. I'm so sorry you're here. But I'm so glad you found this community. It's a great support.",[],,t1_eh1itk9,False,0,[],False,"<div class=""md""><p><strong>(TW-RAINBOW)</strong></p>

My husband and I were pretty united in grief in the month between the diagnosis and the tx. It was after the tx that our grief processing really started to diverge, which shook me a lot. I was crying and raging and super emotional for the first few weeks after the tx; whereas my husband for the most part seemed cool as a cucumber, mostly unphased. He said he‚Äôd done most of his grieving after the diagnosis, before the tx, and I just couldn‚Äôt accept that. I started to resent him for it; it felt like I was the only one who remembered or cared our son had died. At a breaking point I just started talking to him really honestly about my perceptions of his grief, and he was able to show me that my perception wasn‚Äôt the case. I also started reading this book I HIGHLY recommend, called Empty Cradle, Broken Heart. The book talks about different ways of grieving, and it helped me see my husband WAS grieving, just in a different way. Like taking on projects around the house and needing to organize everything. Ultimately though, open lines of communication are key. And sometimes we have to teach our husbands HOW to communicate about feelings so profound (our culture just doesn‚Äôt let them develop this skill like it does girls). 

I understand the primal NEED to talk about it and talk about your baby and I would recommend you find people outside your husband to do that with. Not to say you shouldn‚Äôt talk about it with him, but if you‚Äôre anything like me, you‚Äôre going to need more than him to do all the processing you need to do. Luckily I was already in therapy, so I‚Äôm continuing with that once a week which has been an absolutely lifesaver. Otherwise there have been times when I have legit felt like I‚Äôve gone insane. I also have just started telling close friends, and family, and my Buddhist community, so the grief isn‚Äôt so isolating. People move on with their lives and we‚Äôre still left here with this huge absence and all this love and nothing to do with it. I recommend being open with your community about what you need. I‚Äôve told multiple people - I need you to ask about my son. I need you to bring it up. It doesn‚Äôt make me sad; it helps me because it shows you understand how significant this was.

I‚Äôve had some pretty dark days/periods. I can‚Äôt believe your OB won‚Äôt keep prescribing them for fucks sake. Can you get in to see your GP? I‚Äôve had them prescribe antidepressants before. 

I will warn you ‚Äî one thing I didn‚Äôt expect was the huge emotional plunge right before I got my period back. It‚Äôs probably the darkest I‚Äôve been since the days following the tx and it scared me because I thought I was doing pretty well. Then when I got AF it was like a cloud lifted and I instantly felt a lot more emotionally stable. Just an FYI.

I‚Äôve had them prescribe antidepressants before. </p>

<p>I will warn you ‚Äî one thing I didn‚Äôt expect was the huge emotional plunge right before I got my period back. It‚Äôs probably the darkest I‚Äôve been since the days following the tx and it scared me because I thought I was doing pretty well. Then when I got AF it was like a cloud lifted and I instantly felt a lot more emotionally stable. Just an FYI.</p>

<p>Please feel totally welcome to pm me if you‚Äôd like to chat. This experience is absolutely fucking excruciating and feeling isolated and alone just makes it more so. Take good care of yourself mama. üíï</p>

The hospital was warm and caring and my kick ass, no nonsense obgyn did the procedure. I had to get an iv and answer a bunch of questions, mostly to do with anesthesia. No eating or drinking after midnight. I was out for the whole thing and they let my husband stay with me right up until i went into the room for the procedure. When i woke up, i had a snack and they had put the super sexy maxipad panties on me. Hottt. I had some painkillers given to me while i was under but ibuprofen was enough that night. 

I had some mild cramping and light bleeding that turned to spotting after a few days.  after 8 days, even the spotting disappeared. No baths, swimming, tampons or sex for 2 weeks after the d&c then i had a checkup exam and was given the green light for it all. Ovulated 3 weeks after the procedure, first period came 2 weeks after that, nearly 5 weeks to the day after the d&c.

I was given the option to wait or take medication but for the former, my hcg just kept rising so i was reluctant to wait it out and for the latter, I'd already had a taste of the trauma that bleeding huge clots in your bathroom could bring so i opted out of that. 

The procedure was quick, only 20 mins or so, though i was out for twice that, and the recovery was smooth. Im sure everyone's experience is different, but for me, i would absolutely do it again.

The best advice I got from my nurse was to that it is ok to feel better. And that it&#39;s normal the day after that to not feel better at all. A lot of two steps forward, one step back days. Also, night sweats...no one told me about that, apparently normal as hormones change. So long as there&#39;s no fever, nothing to worry about. </p>

My due date worked out perfectly with the end of the academic year. We finish mid-March and the baby was due mid-April, so I was due to take the full academic year as maternity leave, and it wouldn't be distruptive to the school schedule. 

The school told the students in the year group that I was pregnant and reminded them to be careful around me on the stairs etc. They were really great and they always bought me a chair to sit down and didn't let me carry anything.

My husband grew up being prepared for his mom‚Äôs death, and while science has progressed and she‚Äôs one of the healthiest people I‚Äôve ever met- she‚Äôs not going to live forever.

First - you‚Äôre an awesome boss for seeking advice on how to best support.

Second, what to not do: No living things- including flowers, plants, etc. Their ultimate death can trigger horrible emotions. I would say stay away from meals. We were generously gifted with so many meals, we couldn‚Äôt eat them all and they went to waste. Also, not knowing how they were prepared, the ingredients, etc fed in to my PPA. And sitting down to a meal was the last thing we wanted to do. If you want to do food, consider a basket of small, individual wrapped items and fruits and vegetables instead of a fully prepared meal.

Third, what to do: honor the baby. Find out if they named him/her. If so- have a blanket made, or a canvas or some kind of keepsake that is a tangible reminder to the parents that their baby was loved and cherished and that you, their coworkers acknowledge that. If they didn‚Äôt name the baby, check out Etsy- there are a ton of ideas on there.

Don‚Äôt forget the other kids. There is some weird things that happen after the loss of a baby that the older kids might be around during.  Considering the other children‚Äôs ages you might want to get coloring books and crayons, matchbox cars, etc. small, portable toys that they can busy themselves with.  

Finally, the time off: it‚Äôs so individual. Mom might have a smooth delivery, no issues with PPA/PPD. Or mom might have a hard delivery, complications like RPOC, PPD/PPA, she might be lactating, etc. I would say maintain open lines of communication, respect if she doesn‚Äôt want to give you details and make any accommodations that are reasonable for her job function. 

I hope this is helpful, you‚Äôre an awesome manager.

TW: I do have LC, so that may make my perspective very clouded.

I had 2 children with my precious marriage. Husband and I have had 1 child together, and 4 miscarriages. My older 2 are 17 & 15 and the youngest is 2. We both come from large families and we wanted our LO to have a sibling close in age like the big kids do. 

After our second miscarriage (which was the most physically traumatic of the 4), I said I was done, but the doctors reassured us that it was ok to continue trying. 

When I found out about the last pregnancy, I just knew I couldn‚Äôt go through another pregnancy again. Another positive test, all the anxiety, all the ups and downs, all the ultrasounds. Something about that last pregnancy was different. I was so angry. The positive test didn‚Äôt bring joy. I left my first ultrasound pissed when they said everything looked ok, and the next when they saw a heart beat. Every blood draw felt like torture, and I would almost be in hysterics when they said the numbers looked fine. 

I truly felt like a mad person - completely unable to control my emotions, control my anger about the situation. 

The most triggering was the vaginal ultrasounds. I was just raging pissed every time they would have to stick that wand up me. Even just typing it out brings back awful memories. It was almost like PTSD. I just knew whether that pregnancy lasted or not, I could never go through it all again. 

We lost that pregnancy in December.

This weekend, we have started letting go of baby items & I‚Äôve finally bagged up the maternity clothes. It‚Äôs like a whole new grieving process, because the one thing I always held on to was hope that my son‚Äôs sibling was coming at some time. 

My husband and I both agree- all we wanted in this world was to be able to hold those babies in our arms. But, if we can‚Äôt, let‚Äôs start looking at what a new normal is. We decided we would move abroad in about 8 years (when the big kids are out of college) for one year. We will travel. We will give our son experiences instead of siblings close in age).


I also am studying to become a bereavement doula, so I can help support other moms going through loss. 

I hope this is helpful üíû

Well, I didn't know it at the time but I was a few days pregnant. I'm now 29 weeks and expecting in early May. When you get pregnant again, a new set of worries will take the place of this crappy feeling of frustration you're probably experiencing right now. At times, it seems crazy what people like us put ourselves through... All that pressure we put on ourselves. I would never demand and expect so much in such a complicated and fragile moment from any other person... Yet that is exactly what I did to myself in those months in between pregnancies. 

YMMV, but take care and be kind to yourself as you would a friend or loved one.

With the wanting to travel and live life more, you might consider helping him understand that doesn't have to stop when you have kids. You as parents decide what kind of life you are going to have, and in the future you can always take the kids on trips with you, or even leave them with grandma for the week. Although many still think that perspective is selfish, I think that you still have to have you own identity as people and as a couple and fulfill that on top of also being a parent. They don't have to be one in the same.

&#x200B;

As for trusting him after this. You may have started the conversation, but in the end he did actually consider what you asked and told you no. The fact that he was honest is a really good thing. It shows that he is taking this process seriously and is continuing to think about what it all means. Keep talking to him. You are right in that this may be his grieving process. You could also consider the option of not formally TTC. Just not preventing and living life. A middle ground like that may take off some of the stress he's feeling right now.

I TFMR at 20 weeks just over a year ago. The procedure wasn‚Äôt painful (insertion of the laminaria the night before was the worst part. I definitely recommend someone hold your hand). I went home with some cramping but nothing a mega dose of acetaminophen or ibuprofen and a hot water bottle couldn‚Äôt handle. I have a semi high pain threshold so ymmv.

My milk came in a few days after the D&E (that was terrible but mostly because of the emotions) and stuck around for less than a week. My MIL is a lactation consultant and I‚Äôm happy to share her strategies  if you want but I hate to be an internet stranger giving anyone unsolicited medical advice.

I didn‚Äôt bleed a ton, kind of like a light/occasionally moderate period for a couple days, then spotting (pant liners for maybe two weeks as a precaution). I stayed bloated for probably a month but it‚Äôs hard to say because some of it was also pregnancy weight gain. I was definitely lacking strength and stamina for a while too. Very noticeable the first month. Period came one normal cycle length after the D&E.

 I was too sad/preoccupied with my grief to really try and ‚Äúget back in shape‚Äù for probably half a year.... without changing diet or exercise I was back into all my old clothes by probably 8 months. 

Specific exercise stuff: I was back hiking (take that with a grain of salt if you‚Äôre from somewhere with real mountains - I‚Äôm in NJ) and doing gentle yoga within a few weeks. I was winded pretty easily for a while and didn‚Äôt really try to push my limits/work out in earnest. I suspect I was physically capable of strenuous activity after a month or two but I was so emotionally depleted that it took me a while to find real motivation to strive for things that didn‚Äôt come naturally or weren‚Äôt 100% necessary.

Honestly, the mental/emotional aspect was a million times more painful than the physical. My doctors gave me information on an in person TFMR support group in my area, so maybe ask for mental health resources?

Please lean on this community while you are going through this process. <3 It's an awful club, but know you are not alone. 

I tx at 17w via D&E. Physical recovery - except for breasts - was leaps and bounds easier than the emotional recovery. Physically the next day after the surgery I felt pretty normal. I bled (not heavily - like a light to medium period) for about 2w. My uterus sometimes cramped spontaneously over the next \~4w when I imagine it was shrinking. I could exercise, etc. and do most activities right away - like literally the day after. Stretching up hurt a little for \~3-4w. About 2 days after tx my breasts engorged, which was very painful, and they stayed that way about a week. My milk did not come in, however. 

It took me almost 2 months to lose the weight I'd gained and get back to my pre-pregnancy weight, which I understand was due to hormones. It took 7w for my HCG to return to 0 and 50 days to get my period back. 

Emotionally it has been lots of peaks and valleys. The first 2 days after my procedure I was in an incredible amount of emotional pain. Like, deep in an abyss I thought I'd never crawl out of. I've never hurt that way before. About 4 days before AF returned I felt the same way. In between (I'm 8w out from tx now) there have been lots of different types of ""downs"" but mostly, for me, just a general numbness/lacklusterness/lack of energy/lack of interest in life stuff. 

Take really good care of yourself physically and emotionally. Take as much time off work as you need/can/can afford. Pamper yourself, however that looks for you. I have focused a lot on getting my physical health back in order (had bad HG during first trimester and felt pretty shitty nutritionally, etc.) so I'm taking lots of supplements, eating exceptionally healthy, going to acupuncture, exercising, getting massages, etc. View yourself holistically and pay attention to all the parts of you that are needing healing.

I was 23 weeks along as well. We had amazing support at the hospital we went to as well as a counsellor to come and talk to us about what to expect. 
Physically: I think I bleed for 2-3 weeks, i remember standing in the shower and crying because I wouldn‚Äôt stop bleeding. I am so thankful our counsellor told us to remember you body will take a while to realize it‚Äôs not pregnant anymore but at the same time it won‚Äôt realize you had a loss so my body started producing milk and it was a shock but also very emotional. 
Emotionally: I was a MESS. I was sad, mad, all the emotions. I just wanted my baby back. I would stay in bed for days not wanting to talk or see anyone :(  at the time I am glad i could take that time but I was so focused on my own emotions I forgot that my husband was going through this too. My advice is to have open communication with each other, maybe your SO won‚Äôt want to talk about it but remember your going through this together!! 

My advice: time heals ‚ù§Ô∏è let yourself feel those feelings you are going through, let your body take the time to heal and one day you will be ready to see or talk to other people, you will want to go get a coffee in public and you will progress! You will know when you are ready and when that moment comes you will begin to move forward.. and I am purposely not saying move on. You never move on you never forget but you move forward! 
Celebrate those small wins afterwards. It took me a while to get out of my house and even go to a coffee shop to pick up a coffee, or out for dinner because I was terrified of someone asking me about the baby and me having to tell them. It is brave to start your routine again so celebrate the small things! 
If you decide you don‚Äôt want to tell everyone your story; don‚Äôt. I started tell people especially clients at work that we lost our baby and left it at that. People didn‚Äôt need to know all the details and if you want to tell them your welcome to but remember you don‚Äôt have to. 

I don‚Äôt know where you live or what your plans are but our hospital asked about funeral plans and we decided on going through a local funeral home and have a burial. We also had someone tell us that if you have life insurance some companies will help pay those types of costs after a loss of a baby so we were able to contact ours and get some financial help with the burial/funeral costs.

It's such a terrible thing to go through and all you want to do is try again, but your body can take longer to recover than you were pregnant - so frustrating!

I had a D&C on 11/20 after no heartbeat was detected at a 9 week ultrasound. It stopped sometime in the week prior, as it was detected strongly the week before, but the yolk sac was large, indicating chromosomal issues and likely a loss would happen. I did not get a ""negative"" (< 3) HCG blood test until 1/7, which was 7 weeks later. I did get a normal period starting 12/17 even though HCG was still present and tracking ovulation showed that I ovulated in the next cycle on 1/3 just before the HCG test was negative but my RE said to wait to try until the test was negative.

Here's a look at my HCG levels though out the testing:

11/27 - 2530, 12/10 - 69, 12/19 - 17, 12/31 - 5, 1/7 - 3

Anyway, all that to say, I completely understand the fear, the heartbreak, the weakness... It's a terrible place to be and I am so sorry you went through that.

I found myself very weak for a few weeks afterwards. Between the blood loss, the trauma and the total screwing up of your hormones, you can expect to feel rotten.

This may have been a mistake though. As with everything, she made my loss about her when my H told her over the phone.

Mom had two losses in two separate pregnancies, but she and my father never wanted children to begin with and she didn‚Äôt know she was pregnant when she miscarried with her first child and with my twin. My mom told me in the past that when she had her previous losses, she was relieved (which is fine, that‚Äôs her life). BUT, she can‚Äôt understand why I was so upset back when this happened last week because she can‚Äôt think outside of her own experiences.

My H specifically told her to give me space for a few days and not to call me up and then start talking about her experiences to get me to feel differently (the expectation is that I‚Äôll also stop being upset and comfort her). She totally ignored this and tried to blow up my phone for the next 2 days. When I felt ready to answer the phone, she pretty much did exactly what H told her not to do and I pretty much told her the conversation was over and I hung up.

My H and I didn‚Äôt tell her we were pregnant or even trying beforehand, but we felt it would be good to tell her about our miscarriage since every time we saw her, she would harass us about when we were having children, would look me up and down and ask me if I‚Äôm pregnant. We thought that if she knew, she‚Äôd stop asking.</p>

<p>This may have been a mistake though. As with everything, she made my loss about her when my H told her over the phone. She started going into how she had a miscarriage when pregnant with me (I was originally a twin) and ‚Äúis she sure she‚Äôs not still pregnant? etc, etc‚Äù My mom also cannot conceptualize that our experiences were different. My
Mom had two losses in two separate pregnancies, but she and my father never wanted children to begin with and she didn‚Äôt know she was pregnant when she miscarried with her first child and with my twin. My mom told me in the past that when she had her previous losses, she was relieved (which is fine, that‚Äôs her life). BUT, she can‚Äôt understand why I was so upset back when this happened last week because she can‚Äôt think outside of her own experiences.</p>

<p>My H specifically told her to give me space for a few days and not to call me up and then start talking about her experiences to get me to feel differently (the expectation is that I‚Äôll also stop being upset and comfort her). She totally ignored this and tried to blow up my phone for the next 2 days. When I felt ready to answer the phone, she pretty much did exactly what H told her not to do and I pretty much told her the conversation was over and I hung up.</p>

I had a stillbirth quickly followed by two early losses before we got the pathology report back that explained why our son had been stillborn (this takes months in the U.K.), we got an answer but it was one that did have a risk of recurrence again in future pregnancy - my placentas were failing and we knew blood clots were involved which were a big part of that.

Being totally honest by the time I started trying again I just felt like I‚Äôd been so incredibly broken already that I couldn‚Äôt possibly be more affected by yet another loss.

Find a counselor who will accept a referral right now. Find a counselor who you would be happy to talk to even when you're feeling good.

The time to try again is when you feel both physically and emotionally healthy. Let yourself recover from the grief and let your body heal, too.

The first is that you can miss being pregnant because you're trying to avoid dealing with your grief or you can miss being pregnant despite dealing with your grief. The second is that being mentally ready to try again is a lot different than being physically ready to try again.

So... your doctor is absolutely right that a lot of people need 6 months. I needed a year after I lost my twins in the first trimester. Even after their due date, I still needed several months just to feel like a real person again. There was very little physical healing to do, but mentally, I needed lots of therapy.

But I've had another miscarriage, farther along than the twins, since then, and you know what-- I feel a million times better at 1 month out than I felt at one year out from the twins. I'm coping better. I'm handling the grief better, but now I have to wait longer for my body to heal.

I'm optimistic and ready for IVF#2, but I still have to wait to have two normal periods before they will do the next transfer. I'm still grieving for our baby from IVF#1, but the grief comes and goes. When it's here, it's intense, and when it's not, I feel fairly normal. Small things can make me cry, and I don't have a lot of resilience to deal with big stressors. I am slowly getting back to normal, and I am really excited to try again.

As long as your body has physically healed, and as long as you are not avoiding dealing with your grief, I think you should find a doctor who supports you trying again. It's that perfect mix of being physically healed and emotionally recovered that you need, and don't be embarrassed for one second if you've got it. If you don't have it, don't be embarrassed about that either, but do be realistic and give yourself the time you need for both kinds of recovery.",[],,t1_eg55dbu,False,0,[],False,"<div class=""md""><p>I think that there are two important distinctions to be made here:

A lot of people act like the doctor is the boss, and I feel like my doctor works for me to keep me in the health I want to be in with the interventions I want to use. 

I have an IVF clinic that is mostly on board with this and my OB's office is 100% on board with this. I get the tests I want when I want them, and if insurance won't cover them, I pay out of pocket. But, for me, it's worth paying whatever I have to pay to get the care I think I need. We've also spent over $50,000 at this point in our attempt for baby #1, so I have definitely paid more money than a lot of people would.

Call around until you find a doctor who is worried about it now. Ask the doctor for a list of all the tests that could be done, and then go home and research them to see what you want done. Here's what I can remember of the tests I had done:
HSG (Surprise! one blocked tube, tubal cannulation not an option)
Hysteroscopy (Not the threesome I always dreamed of! I had two docs-- one to hold the ultrasound wand and another to inject the saline)
Genetic disease screen (negative for 249/250 genes tests, carrier for MTHFR, put on methyl folate in addition to pre-natals)
Different genetic disease screen (found mutation remotely associated with c-reactive protein issue, but I only had one of two needed mutations for it to be an issue)
Genetic karyotyping (normal)
Host of blood work, including: thyroid, progesterone, a1c, red blood cell counts, inflammation levels, and more
A special set of bloodwork called Repeated Loss Panel, but I don't remember what that was supposed to tell us-- everything came back normal on that one
A full set of cardiac tests after repeated high blood pressure readings-- including multiple EKGs, a calcium scoring (0), a cardiac stress test (I made it to 7 minutes when they stopped the test because my blood pressure was so high they said I was at risk of a stroke, despite not sweating or having trouble breathing... final determination was that equipment was faulty, but the last blood pressure reading they did was manually and was within normal limits so they said I was fine), and a few appointments with a cardiologist to find out there is nothing physically or electrically wrong with my heart.
I had some special tests done for a clinic in Japan when we were planning to do IVF there (don't-- they are 5-10 years behind the rest of the world in IVF), but they were weird things even my doctor here hadn't heard of and I can't remember the name of them. One of them involved taking samples of sperm from my vagina at x hours after intercourse and looking at how the sperm was behaving. Nothing abnormal from what the doctor could see, but again-- this is a weird test for the US so it's not like they had a ton of experience at looking at 3 hour old sperm from a woman's vagina.


My husband had a sperm analysis done 4 times-- three times at one-month intervals to get an idea of what his sperm was doing over time. Since he was losing weight, his sperm got better every month. He also got a genetic test since I was a MTHFR carrier. Other than that, he didn't have to do anything. He was negative for 250/250 genetic tests, but he does have dyslexia and a family history of learning disabilities.


On our fourth miscarriage, the IVF clinic suggested genetic testing on the ""products of conception"" (a term I despise), and that genetic test is basically a karyotyping, which came back normal. 

For all of this, for all the tests and the money we've spent, we still have no idea why I can't stay pregnant. Other than the blocked tube, every test has reaffirmed that I should be able to get and stay pregnant. I've lost count of how many chemical pregnancies I've had over the last 6 years. 

I hope you find the care you're looking for. I hope you get your take-home baby soon. Feel free to IM me if you want more information on any of the tests I've had done.

",[],,t1_eg4j525,False,0,[],False,"<div class=""md""><p>You can call around until you find a doctor who will do what you want them to do. A lot of people act like the doctor is the boss, and I feel like my doctor works for me to keep me in the health I want to be in with the interventions I want to use. </p>

<p>I have an IVF clinic that is mostly on board with this and my OB&#39;s office is 100% on board with this. I get the tests I want when I want them, and if insurance won&#39;t cover them, I pay out of pocket. But, for me, it&#39;s worth paying whatever I have to pay to get the care I think I need. We&#39;ve also spent over $50,000 at this point in our attempt for baby #1, so I have definitely paid more money than a lot of people would.</p>

<p>Call around until you find a doctor who is worried about it now. Ask the doctor for a list of all the tests that could be done, and then go home and research them to see what you want done. Here&#39;s what I can remember of the tests I had done:
HSG (Surprise! one blocked tube, tubal cannulation not an option)
Hysteroscopy (Not the threesome I always dreamed of! I had two docs-- one to hold the ultrasound wand and another to inject the saline)
Genetic disease screen (negative for 249/250 genes tests, carrier for MTHFR, put on methyl folate in addition to pre-natals)
Different genetic disease screen (found mutation remotely associated with c-reactive protein issue, but I only had one of two needed mutations for it to be an issue)
Genetic karyotyping (normal)
Host of blood work, including: thyroid, progesterone, a1c, red blood cell counts, inflammation levels, and more
A special set of bloodwork called Repeated Loss Panel, but I don&#39;t remember what that was supposed to tell us-- everything came back normal on that one
A full set of cardiac tests after repeated high blood pressure readings-- including multiple EKGs, a calcium scoring (0), a cardiac stress test (I made it to 7 minutes when they stopped the test because my blood pressure was so high they said I was at risk of a stroke, despite not sweating or having trouble breathing... final determination was that equipment was faulty, but the last blood pressure reading they did was manually and was within normal limits so they said I was fine), and a few appointments with a cardiologist to find out there is nothing physically or electrically wrong with my heart.
I had some special tests done for a clinic in Japan when we were planning to do IVF there (don&#39;t-- they are 5-10 years behind the rest of the world in IVF), but they were weird things even my doctor here hadn&#39;t heard of and I can&#39;t remember the name of them. One of them involved taking samples of sperm from my vagina at x hours after intercourse and looking at how the sperm was behaving. Nothing abnormal from what the doctor could see, but again-- this is a weird test for the US so it&#39;s not like they had a ton of experience at looking at 3 hour old sperm from a woman&#39;s vagina.</p>

<p>My husband had a sperm analysis done 4 times-- three times at one-month intervals to get an idea of what his sperm was doing over time. Since he was losing weight, his sperm got better every month. He also got a genetic test since I was a MTHFR carrier. Other than that, he didn&#39;t have to do anything. He was negative for 250/250 genetic tests, but he does have dyslexia and a family history of learning disabilities.</p>

<p>On our fourth miscarriage, the IVF clinic suggested genetic testing on the &quot;products of conception&quot; (a term I despise), and that genetic test is basically a karyotyping, which came back normal. </p>

<p>For all of this, for all the tests and the money we&#39;ve spent, we still have no idea why I can&#39;t stay pregnant. Other than the blocked tube, every test has reaffirmed that I should be able to get and stay pregnant. I&#39;ve lost count of how many chemical pregnancies I&#39;ve had over the last 6 years. </p>

<p>I hope you find the care you&#39;re looking for. I hope you get your take-home baby soon. Feel free to IM me if you want more information on any of the tests I&#39;ve had done.</p>

Honestly, the thing I appreciate most is when a friend comes over to my house and just hangs out. My last miscarriage was less than a month ago, and my best friend came over and we made cards using my Cricut Maker. To be fair, I copied the card she made and gave it to my husband's niece for her birthday, but that was about 10 times more effort than I wanted to put into it.

Just the effort of being up and talking made me have gross I'm-on-narcotics sweats, and I had to take a shower in the middle of her visit because I just felt so gross. But, it gave my husband a break, it interrupted my routine of sleep, nap, eat, nap, eat, sleep, and even though I was super lame to be around, I remember that she was there. 

Also, there's a lot of trust that goes into having someone come over when you are feeling so raw. It's okay if all you can say is, ""we love you."" It's better to say nothing than to say the wrong thing. I don't want to hear a single word my mom has to say about any of my losses. It's a matter of trust-- and my mom is a great mom, but she is judgmental as fuck when it comes to things pregnant women do. She's made comments about how I'm too old to have kids, and I just have zero trust that she can say anything without saying the wrong thing. I know she loves me and is sad right along with me, but the words that come out of her mouth are super likely to be the wrong words. 

I actually wanted flowers. I told my husband to pick up flowers after my surgery. He forgot. I keep thinking that I wish our baby had some flowers. My husband did all the cleaning and cooking for weeks on end-- I just did the dishes for the first thing in almost a month. He drove me everywhere because I didn't have the ability to cope with driving-- the tiniest bit of stress just sent me over the edge. I don't fault him for forgetting the flowers, but I still feel like I wish my baby had some. I'm planning to get some flowers for her due date.

Your friend is probably feeling very sensitive. Just writing this response has me in tears and I'm almost a month out of my most recent loss. Don't try to cheer her up. Don't worry too much about her. Just be sad over her loss with her. At first, my husband was super worried about me, and it came across in everything he did. I finally broke down and sobbed, ""Why can't you just be sad with me?"" His feelings were complicated-- he felt helpless to protect our baby, and he still had feelings of wanting to protect me. He was able to talk about his feelings and his sense of loss, but when it happened, his first instinct was to do everything in an effort to make sure I was okay. That exacerbated my pain because I felt even more alone-- like I was the only one who was grieving for our baby. So, if you can, express to your friend how sad you are over the loss of her baby, and trust that she will take care of her physical and mental health on her own terms. In a few months, if she isn't doing those things, then it's okay to encourage her to get help. But now is the time to just be sad with her.

He ordered a bunch of bloodwork and an HSG (unrelated to the miscarriages) and gave me a plan for my next pregnancy. This has given me hope to try again because at least I am doing something. I‚Äôd recommend reaching out to your current Dr and going from there. </p>
