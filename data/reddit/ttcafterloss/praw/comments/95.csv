I am currently pregnant.

I had to spend five days in the hospital a few weeks ago, it was a nightmare bc of covid restrictions - couldn‚Äôt have visitors so didn‚Äôt see my four year old the whole time. Masked for five days.

But I couldn‚Äôt stay because we don‚Äôt have trustworthy childcare during a pandemic. NICU restrictions made delivering at 31 weeks a nightmare - my husband prob wouldn‚Äôt see the baby at all for 8 weeks. I‚Äôm walking around right now terrified of every twitch and movement, trying to weigh risking my life to keep him in there baking where he is safest, with a potential of delivering too early and a NICU stay - taxing/nearly impossible for our whole family including my daughter. 

I had planned to deliver naturally at a birth center, my friend just did. She had a healthy pregnancy and delivered in March when things were heating up in the US. Being pregnant with a healthy pregnancy during these times is strange. No partners at doc and imaging appointments, delivery restrictions - most hospitals are requiring masking during labor and delivery. But if you don‚Äôt have a healthy pregnancy, things are just hard. Every decision you‚Äôre faced with is overly complicated by covid, and I feel like I‚Äôm making a lot of decisions blind - like what does it look like if I have a baby at 32 weeks and he has weakened lungs for a year? Who knows what this is going to look like in a year? 

Plus, everything I had planned to help me with my daughter during the hot summer at the end of the pregnancy is gone. No play dates running thru sprinklers, going to the pool, air conditioned afternoons at the aquarium indoor playground. We sit around the house, she wants attention, she‚Äôs super social and super bored and needs my attention and I‚Äôm tired and in pain and over everything, and I‚Äôm feeling guilty that we aren‚Äôt bonding enough in these final months/weeks. Who knows if she will go back to school in the fall and when she does, she‚Äôs gonna bring home ear infections and standard kid funk in the fall, not to mention covid, when I have a tiny vulnerable baby at home. 

We are at an almost five year age gap and we are older parents, so I get being concerned about the age gap. But if I could do it again with a crystal ball and if I had control over when I got pregnant, I just don‚Äôt know. Considering I had a textbook pregnancy with my first, I never saw these weird complications coming. But man, it is hard.

Who knows if she will go back to school in the fall and when she does, she‚Äôs gonna bring home ear infections and standard kid funk in the fall, not to mention covid, when I have a tiny vulnerable baby at home. </p>

<p>We are at an almost five year age gap and we are older parents, so I get being concerned about the age gap. But if I could do it again with a crystal ball and if I had control over when I got pregnant, I just don‚Äôt know. Considering I had a textbook pregnancy with my first, I never saw these weird complications coming. But man, it is hard. </p>

This is a topic I‚Äôm super invested in and will tell you what I have learned, but of course is not to be taken as medical advice yada yada.

This is the first supplement that I actually felt helped. I also am off caffeine completely now, as slight changes or late consumption leads me to get a migraine as well. I will drink a ‚Äúbaby‚Äù coke with Tylenol if I feel a migraine coming on Per OB suggestions.

I noticed first reply was from someone who recs Botox. I had Botox for migraines for 3 years and it worked great but you will NOT find a doctor who will give it to you while TTC.

However, I do fully agree that your pain is not worth it and there are some triptans and/or other meds they can prescribe and provide use with caution. 

Lastly, while TTC I‚Äôve gone back to taking the meds I need until the 2WW. The belief is that they are short lived in your body, but that‚Äôs what I am currently doing.

I started to have more energy and conceived about two cycles later. I honestly don‚Äôt think that had to do with my thyroid, since I was always ovulating and had a long enough LP. If anything made a difference, it was probably having the HSG.

Since my miscarriage, my TSH climbed up close to 3 again. I‚Äôve been exhausted and keep gaining weight so my RE upped the levothyroxine to 50mcg.

My RE was in agreement with trying to get in under 2.5 for TTC. I N started 25mcg if levothyroxine (a very low dose). My TSH went done to around 1.5. I started to have more energy and conceived about two cycles later. I honestly don‚Äôt think that had to do with my thyroid, since I was always ovulating and had a long enough LP.

I‚Äôve heard from other women whose OBs recommended a full year of trying before any intervention but we‚Äôd gotten pregnant on cycle 1 or 2 for our previous 2 pregnancies and since we had such a tough loss my OB has been wonderful about honoring any requests that might be outside of the ‚Äúnormal‚Äù timeline of things. Best of luck on your rainbow!</p>

I&#39;m sorry that anybody has to go through these kinds of losses. üíî Thanks for any insight, reading here has been so helpful these last few days.</p>

So my story is somewhat similar - I had two CP's right at the 4 week mark and then had a whole bunch of bloodwork done. My TSH was at about a 10. I got on levothyroxine (100mcg) and within four weeks my TSH shot down to below zero and I've been adjusting dosages ever since to try to keep a steady 1-2 range.

Once my thyroid got under control I definitely noticed positive changes right away such as ovulating a bit earlier, higher progesterone levels post-O, and more/better quality cervical mucus.

For me, I have still not had success since treating my thyroid but my next two pregnancies did last quite a bit longer.

One thing to check is if you were tested for thyroid antibodies. This would essentially show if you are just hypothyroidism (underactive thyroid), or if you have hashimoto's thyroiditis (antibodies are attacking your thyroid which causes it to be underactive). 

In addition to medication, you might also find recommendations to cut gluten and dairy, and make sure you're getting enough iodine, zinc, selenium and magnesium.

I've tried to research and find exactly what thyroid mechanism could cause the miscarriage but I don't fully understand it. The antibodies could potentially have a negative impact and cause your body to attack the pregnancy, but studies are mixed. I joined a Hypo + Pregnancy group on Facebook and see plenty of moms who have high TSH and/or antibodies and are carrying to term.

I don't know if anyone is still here who was around when I was trying in 2017/2018, but that's when I frequented the sub.  I've now had three miscarriages and have two living children.  

This is the first month we're even supposed to be sort of trying.  Given our history, we figured might as well get the next miscarriage out of the way (sad, but likely?).  We timed sex perfectly, and I was so ready to just have an easy time getting pregnant--like all those people who get pregnant by accident!--and tried to talk myself out of it, but somehow was certain the universe had planned for me to be pregnant this month and not have to deal with any more miscarriages before the arrival of what I hope is a 2021 baby.  I feel stupid now! 

Today's 10/11DPO, of course there's no second line, and I was not prepared for the rush of feelings I'd have about it.  My mind immediately goes to the ""my body is broken"" mentality, and I just feel crushed already at the thought of trying this again.  I don't know how to embark upon this process again, but I also really, really want a baby.

But when I'm going through what I'm going through I can't be positive and in denial, it's just not healthy. 

I'd honestly be really upset if someone sent me a sympathy novel right now, my husband and I are big into Disney movies, and cartoons and stuff (lame I know, 90's kids though lol) and lately that's one of the things we can't enjoy, there are songs that I love, but can't listen to right now because they just hit so close to home. After a loss like this your brain tries to make a connection with what your going through in everything, and it's so hard to just watch a show or listen to a song how its meant to be seen and heard.

But on the other hand, my one friend who is pregnant was probably the best about it, and its honestly like she already knew about it, i even had to ask my husband if he reached out to her because the way she initiated the conversation was like she already knew, and I havent posted once about it. 
She started off telling me she understands if I don't want to talk about it, and asked me if it was confirmed that I lost the baby, followed by ""this is the only question I'll ask i swear"" then told me that even though I know the reality of it to just try and stay positive that this will happen naturally, and told me she was always with me in spirit.

Sometimes you just need to vent about what's going on without people telling you its going to be okay, especially when they know what your going through, and know that eventually things will get better, but it's okay to not be okay for the time being. 

I have PCOS and have been basically told that it might not ever happen for me, so I was really excited when I had 2 positive tests, but like my husband told me yesterday at least we now know that it can happen, and that we can get pregnant. 

We are planning on taking a much needed vacation after I'm all healed up physically so that I can enjoy the amenities, and he wants us to go away this weekend and spend time with his family, which would be so nice to get away for the weekend, but his sister's got pregnant at the same time last year and they both have newborns, and as much as I want to see everyone right now, I don't know if that would trigger me or not at the moment, so I just told him maybe we can go.

<p>I&#39;d honestly be really upset if someone sent me a sympathy novel right now, my husband and I are big into Disney movies, and cartoons and stuff (lame I know, 90&#39;s kids though lol) and lately that&#39;s one of the things we can&#39;t enjoy, there are songs that I love, but can&#39;t listen to right now because they just hit so close to home. After a loss like this your brain tries to make a connection with what your going through in everything, and it&#39;s so hard to just watch a show or listen to a song how its meant to be seen and heard.</p>

<p>But on the other hand, my one friend who is pregnant was probably the best about it, and its honestly like she already knew about it, i even had to ask my husband if he reached out to her because the way she initiated the conversation was like she already knew, and I havent posted once about it. 
She started off telling me she understands if I don&#39;t want to talk about it, and asked me if it was confirmed that I lost the baby, followed by &quot;this is the only question I&#39;ll ask i swear&quot; then told me that even though I know the reality of it to just try and stay positive that this will happen naturally, and told me she was always with me in spirit.</p>

<p>Sometimes you just need to vent about what&#39;s going on without people telling you its going to be okay, especially when they know what your going through, and know that eventually things will get better, but it&#39;s okay to not be okay for the time being. </p>

<p>I have PCOS and have been basically told that it might not ever happen for me, so I was really excited when I had 2 positive tests, but like my husband told me yesterday at least we now know that it can happen, and that we can get pregnant. </p>

<p>We are planning on taking a much needed vacation after I&#39;m all healed up physically so that I can enjoy the amenities, and he wants us to go away this weekend and spend time with his family, which would be so nice to get away for the weekend, but his sister&#39;s got pregnant at the same time last year and they both have newborns, and as much as I want to see everyone right now, I don&#39;t know if that would trigger me or not at the moment, so I just told him maybe we can go. I think we need some time together regardless.</p>

My doctor did state that she has found that the negative mental impact caused by waiting for the miscarriage is usually worse than just taking the drugs as it is so safe.

I‚Äôm not religious but I did take a moment to sit outside and say goodbye to this little soul and relive all the happy moments he/she had brought me during that short time. I felt like it helped me have closure. I also created a milestones list to help pass time and get my mind off it! I put things like finish this book I was reading, my next OB appt, having a sushi date night, etc.! Idk, just throwing ideas out there :) only time will help, hang in there!</p>

I‚Äôm sad but somehow ok, I think, and going back and forth between hopeful/not hopeful, terrified/optimistic, angry/accepting.  </p>

<p>Sending love to you all today, &amp; thank you for helping to start healing my heart. This would all suck even more without you ‚ù§Ô∏è</p>

You can definitely control this! I'll share my story because I think it shows what gradual changes with accountability (to yourself, an app, loved ones, etc.) can really do. 

I went into my pregnancy heavier than I have ever been and after my 12w D&C on February 19, I super-glued myself to the couch with ice cream, brie, sushi, deli sandwiches, and basically anything I had denied myself during pregnancy. Fast forward about 4 weeks, and I was at my all-time heaviest with a solid 35-40 pounds to lose to get back to a healthy weight. 

In mid-March I complained to my best friend over the phone about life just kind of sucking with the shutdowns and how none of my clothes fit anymore, and her response was, ""You sound kinda depressed."" It was a bit of a wake-up call, since I thought everything was OK but that I was just a little blue. I asked for her advice -- she named a few things (WeightWatchers, Noom, etc.) that had worked for people she knows. 

Right after our call, I started the free two-week trial with Noom (which gave me structure, support network, and reminders that taking care of yourself is a form of self love). After a few weeks of only changing my food habits, I started walking more and doing free pilates workouts through the FitOn app. Then I switched to the Peloton app for spin bike sessions 1-2 times a week. I incrementally increased the number and intensity of my workouts each week. About three weeks ago, I bought a road bike and my partner and I go for 2-3 long bike rides (in addition to spinning) each week. We love spending the time together. I canceled Noom (after three months, I felt like I'd gotten what I needed out of the program) and use MyFitnessPal to track calories and macros. I've lost a little over 16 pounds so far (partner has lost 20+), and gained a bunch of leg muscles that I haven't seen since my 20s!

The biggest thing for me that helped me feel good about myself throughout this process -- which has included some tough plateaus -- was accountability. I made myself accountable in my apps by tracking what I was doing and by paying for the apps (and then my bike), it made me really want to ""get my money's worth"". That said, the very best part was having my partner join in. We really are doing this as a team now and we look forward to spending time together working out or trying healthier versions of the recipes we love. Last, but not least, it has given us something to focus on together besides fertility and that has helped us positively cope with our loss in ways I could have never imagined.

If you really push, your doctor may order it after 2 losses in some cases, especially when you‚Äôre 30+. I had it done after a chemical, a suspected chemical (never confirmed so my doc didn‚Äôt really count it) and an early miscarriage (5+6) and it was discovered that I had antiphospholipid syndrome which is a blood clotting disorder that can effect implantation and placenta functioning. My doc speculated that it may be what caused me to keep miscarrying at a certain time - always between 5+1 and 5+6. It seems that my APS manifests in mostly early implantation issues rather than placental functioning issues. </p>

<li><p>I was put on progesterone suppositories immediately as a ‚Äújust in case, might help but won‚Äôt hurt‚Äù. My RPL testing didn‚Äôt happen until about 14 weeks, and when I got my positive APS diagnosis at 16-17 weeks, my doc called me at 7:58am (office opened at 8:30...) and told me to come in immediately because my baby was at risk of dying. I was put on lovenox injections and baby aspirin for the remainder of my pregnancy. If I choose to try for a second child I will start lovenox and progesterone as soon as I get a positive, and just take the baby aspirin continuously. </p></li>
<li><p>I got pregnant again immediately following the last CP. I miscarried Dec 8, and had a positive test Jan 1. Between my previous losses I had about 6 months but I waited 6 weeks because the hospital told me to and we weren‚Äôt ready to immediately try again. I had no trouble getting pregnant... I just had a lot of trouble staying that way. </p></li>

But especially with pregnancy and baby loss, because it‚Äôs so taboo to acknowledge that babies and kids die, and that it‚Äôs not as rare as anyone would like to think. For most people hearing someone say out loud ‚Äúmy baby died‚Äù is terrifying because it puts it into reality, that babies can, and do die, which is really hard for many people to even fathom or acknowledge. </p>

<p>Unfortunately for us loss parents, we don‚Äôt get the luxury of pretending it doesn‚Äôt happen, or if stuffing it under the rug. We have to sit with that grief every day for the rest of our lives. I find it cathartic to specifically tell people ‚ÄúI understand you‚Äôre trying to be helpful, but telling me it wasn‚Äôt meant to be my baby, or I can have another one, doesn‚Äôt help because that was my baby and I wanted that one, not another baby...that specific baby.‚Äù I‚Äôll tell them a helpful sentiment to share the next time, and 9 out of 10 people seem really grateful to have been given a script to use for next time (like just saying I‚Äôm so sorry your baby died, I can‚Äôt even imagine how painful that must be). People are generally just well intentioned but ignorant. I‚Äôm so sorry for your loss and for the insensitive comments you‚Äôre having to endure.</p>

[here‚Äôs the link. ](https://academic.oup.com/humupd/article/20/2/262/663622) 

This article is comprehensive and cited by many blog type articles, showing that about 19%  of women have an IUA (scar) after a miscarriage and this number is higher for those with multiple D&Cs vs just one vs expectant management. Half these adhesions were mild.

I ended up reading this article in DETAIL and even read the abstracts of the individual source studies (it‚Äôs a meta analysis and pools data from multiple other studies.) My conclusion is this ~20% number is completely overstated and thrown around incorrectly by people who only read the abstract.

Why? This study is based on women *who had a hysteroscopy after a miscarriage.* That means women who had a miscarriage or D&C who didn‚Äôt decide to get a hysteroscopy couldn‚Äôt have been part of the study. What kind of women don‚Äôt get a hysteroscopy after a miscarriage? Well, me. People who aren‚Äôt having symptoms of abnormal issues with their uterus. People who conceived after their D&C. So when they say ~20%, they mean 20% of women who had reason to suspect there was something wrong with their uterus, were not pregnant, and got a medical treatment! That means 20% is biased and overstated. In fact, to be sure, I read the methodologies of most of the cited studies. Some of them weren‚Äôt even designed to test the prevalence of IUAs, but were actually designed to diagnose uterine problems as an explanation for that miscarriage‚Äîin other words, there was some suspicion that a uterine abnormality caused the miscarriage (not the other way around)‚ÄîNOT the case for all miscarriages and not the case for mine, which were both chromosomal defects. 

Another piece of evidence to show how wrong it is to believe the 20% number: a whopping 69 out of 675 total women across these studies had a bicornate or septate uterus‚Äî10%!! For a condition that other sources estimate is between 0.1% and 0.6% of the general population. This all points to the same serious problems with selection: Women with abnormal issues with their uterus are getting these hysterioscopies and are getting studied, and ‚Äúnormal‚Äù women who have D&Cs are not.

Finally, two other issues: these studies were primarily published in the 90s (which means the data is even older), and also, most were conducted outside North America or Western Europe (quite a few in China and Brazil). Medical advances are a thing, especially in the developing world. D&Cs are performed with blunt instruments now, and sometimes are assisted by ultrasound. These all reduce the probability of scarring. 

So that was unnecessarily long but the point is: yes, D&Cs can cause scarring. Yes, more D&Cs probably cause more scarring.

So I have picked another boy and girl name- names that we loved but couldn‚Äôt/didn‚Äôt want to use for some reason and we will privately (my husband and I) refer to our lost baby by that name.

<p>I know what they‚Äôre saying when they say that is it‚Äôs very common and most people still go on to have healthy babies so don‚Äôt worry that you won‚Äôt be able to in the future but sometimes you don‚Äôt want to look to the future you want it acknowledged that you have suffered a deep painful loss and the life of the baby you lost mattered and you are in physical and emotional pain.</p>

<p>I think a lot of people just find loss and grief very uncomfortable topics and it makes them very awkward.</p>

<p>I would try maybe saying..I know that statistically miscarriage is common but I‚Äôm not a statistic this happened to my body and my baby that the fact that it happens to a lot of other women doesn‚Äôt change my feelings. I need to just sit with it and experience my feelings and have them fully acknowledged as the start of my journey of moving forward. I don‚Äôt want to make you feel bad because I know you are trying to be kind and supportive but please don‚Äôt try to make me feel like I shouldn‚Äôt feel the way I feel right now.</p>

Things that have helped:

Therapy- I would encourage you to seek it out if you have the means. It really helped me to unpack my unhealthy habits. Learning to love my body for the things I am ABLE to do.

Learning a new skill- water colouring, sewing, anything creative, riding a road bike etc. When you‚Äôre smashing other goals in life, you feel better overall. Good way to distract during TWW. 

Months off social media/reddit forums/baby talk ban- I was stuck in a BAD cycle of googling every symptom, every tip, comparing cycles, seeing lineporn, talked to hubby daily about fertility and almost forgot that he‚Äôs on this damn journey too! He feels this stress, the pressure on him to ‚Äúperform‚Äù and can feel guilt. Just a shift in mindset, positive affirmations and limiting exposure to bullshit online was amazing.

My FS says do whatever makes you feel less stressed out. Drink if you want, have an OPK-free month or solely take a basic prenatal. Just make sure you‚Äôre kind to yourself and do things that make you happy üòä

I hate that it‚Äôs ‚Äútraditional‚Äù for it to be thrown by a friend. What if someone has crappy friends or no one steps up? Im sure there are plenty of ladies who were too shy to throw their own baby shower because no one offered to throw one for them and thats just sad. 

My SIL had a baby in Feb of this year and my husband‚Äôs family wanted me to be involved in the baby shower in December even though I just lost a baby at 14 weeks in November. some people started asking around the room when certain ladies were going to start trying and I left before it got to me because I was NOT going to keep it together if it came to me. Then SIL#2 came out to get me because ‚Äúpeople were asking where I was...‚Äù. üò§ 

Best Friend #1 was also due in February and I threw a baby shower for her in January. I supplied the house and the food and told my Best Friend #2 she needed to be in charge of games because thats all I had the bandwidth for. I took a xanax that day.

I was going to have to throw Best Friend #2 a baby shower just last week but then COVID happened and I had a sigh of selfish relief. I WOULD have sucked it up and done it with a smile, but I am so glad I didn‚Äôt have to. We at least sent out invites so she could get the loot, and then canceled a couple weeks before the party date.

TLDR: Baby showers are boring, sexist, and painful all at the same time and I will rant for hours why they‚Äôre awful.

This was met with ‚Äúbut he‚Äôs a guy, he knows nothing about babies‚Äù. True, but shes a first time mom and knows nothing about babies either. BOTH of them would need to learn what they needed for this list and she is EFFING BUSY with her residency so maybe he should be expected to pull some weight here.</p>

<p>I hate that it‚Äôs ‚Äútraditional‚Äù for it to be thrown by a friend. What if someone has crappy friends or no one steps up? Im sure there are plenty of ladies who were too shy to throw their own baby shower because no one offered to throw one for them and thats just sad. </p>

<p>My SIL had a baby in Feb of this year and my husband‚Äôs family wanted me to be involved in the baby shower in December even though I just lost a baby at 14 weeks in November. some people started asking around the room when certain ladies were going to start trying and I left before it got to me because I was NOT going to keep it together if it came to me. Then SIL#2 came out to get me because ‚Äúpeople were asking where I was...‚Äù. üò§ </p>

<p>Best Friend #1 was also due in February and I threw a baby shower for her in January. I supplied the house and the food and told my Best Friend #2 she needed to be in charge of games because thats all I had the bandwidth for. I took a xanax that day.</p>

<p>I was going to have to throw Best Friend #2 a baby shower just last week but then COVID happened and I had a sigh of selfish relief. I WOULD have sucked it up and done it with a smile, but I am so glad I didn‚Äôt have to. We at least sent out invites so she could get the loot, and then canceled a couple weeks before the party date.</p>

<p>TLDR: Baby showers are boring, sexist, and painful all at the same time and I will rant for hours why they‚Äôre awful.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, I will still have one when my time comes and none of you have to come because I know how awful they are.</p>

<p>Ok, rant over.</p>

I'm so glad for you you were able to catch it early and resolve it without any damage to yourself; that is really, really wonderful, but of course, it doesn't make where you are now any easier.

I'm not the best with words, so some of this may sound a bit clunky/awkward. I'm sorry for that. My husband and I lost our first baby to an ectopic back in April. I don't know if I can truly put into words how devastating the loss was, even though I'd caught it really early, and was only 6 weeks along when I was treated via methotrexate. Ever since then, I can't look at pregnant women. I can't watch someone on TV having an ultrasound, or listening to their baby's heartbeat. Not without breaking down. Because it's like, that should have been me, you know? I should have been the one going into my second trimester, and going to appointments to hear our baby's heartbeat and looking at maternity clothes, and maybe picking out baby stuff. But instead I'm here, on CD13, trying to figure out if the ovulation test I took the other day means I'm going to ovulate today, tomorrow, next week, next year, who knows. 

I try to be positive. I really do. I caught my pregnancy early. My hcg levels never went past maybe 250, so I don't think I was ever in danger of a rupture. I only needed one shot of methotrexate before my levels started to tank. And my withdrawal bleed came really quickly, followed by my first period 29 days later. So many people don't get to have this kind of experience when dealing with an ectopic. And I'm grateful that mine wasn't any more traumatic than it already was. But it's *so hard.*

As I (possibly) move into my first TWW post-ectopic, I'm scared. My grief is so up and down, I don't know what I'll do if we don't get pregnant this cycle. How will I feel? Will I be OK mentally? Emotionally? If we do get pregnant, will I be able to feel happy about it, or will I feel the same dread with my first pregnancy that something's not quite right? I wish so much I could go back to a time before I had my ectopic. When I could be excited about the idea of being pregnant, and the possibility of the future. Hell, I wish I could go back on TFAB and post in all my naivety about how frustrated I was with the TTC process (God, you never realize how real the struggle is until you're told you can't for months). But instead, like you said, I'm trying my best to piece my smashed vase back together into something of what it once was. 

I know you're feeling really low today, but I just wanted to say thank you. Thank you for making me feel like I'm not crazy. That my feelings are very much real, and very much felt by other folks who have gone through similar situations. Just take it one day at a time. As best you can. If you need to cry, cry. If you need to rant, rant. That's what we're all here for, as we try to move forward on this heartbreaking journey. And with time, and hopefully with a pregnancy that ends in a happy, healthy baby, you'll finally be able to heal.

There's just pain no matter which way I turn. Grief over the loss, fear of it happening again if we do get pregnant. But thinking about giving up and accepting a life without children is breaking my heart too.

It's especially hard today because last night I found out that one of my stepdaughter's friends is pregnant. She's 17 years old and about as responsible as most 17 year olds. She also suffers from histrionic personality disorder so she'll definitely make an awesome mother =/.

After I found out about my first MMC (Oct 2019) at the 8 week sono, I was angry. I knew miscarriages were possible but didn‚Äôt know that I could have absolutely no symptoms if my baby died. It was cruel and I beat myself up over it so badly. I had a difficult home life growing up, but none of the horrible things I endured as a child ever broke me as much as that first miscarriage did. Then, a month later my sister and her boyfriend of 2 months (who is now in jail on violent charges) announced their pregnancy. Boy was I pissed. It felt like a kick in the face. I spent a long time being angry and bitter at the world, God, the universe, everything. Then I found out I was pregnant again on Christmas Eve. I was still very bitter but obviously excited to have another chance so soon. But then a few weeks later, another miscarriage. This one natural. Cue more anger. Then in March, another positive pregnancy test. I figured okay, third time is the charm, surely the first two were just random flukes right? Nope, 11 week sono with no heartbeat after seeing my perfect little tiny baby at 7 weeks. 

At this point in this season of grief, I am doing a lot of healing. I am going to therapy, doing a lot of outdoor activities, and allowing myself to relax a bit. I‚Äôm not going to lie, it is still so hard. I have dreams almost ever night of either being heavily pregnant or caring for a baby. But I have decided that I can‚Äôt live angry and bitter anymore. Of course I still have moments of anger. Although this season of my life has been so challenging and heartbreaking, I have never felt so in tune with my mind and body as I do today. My relationship with my husband has grown stronger. I have acquired a wealth of knowledge about reproduction and nutrition. My diet has never been more nutritious or balanced. There are many good things coming from my miscarriages that probably never would have happened otherwise. It has been SO HARD, but I feel like I am at the point where I can honestly say that I would never go back and change what happened. Even if I keep miscarrying, I now have the motivation to keep going. My future children are going to be so loved, even if they don‚Äôt come from my womb. 

Nothing will ever completely erase the pain we feel. I hope that you find healing and are able to build the beautiful family that you deserve.

Recently, I was thinking about last year at this time. We were waiting to try because I was going on a big trip with a friend in July. We'd just gotten back from a European vacation. We had another trip on the books for our 'dating anniversary' in September. We've traveled a lot and seen a lot of cool places. We loved our little family of two plus our cats.

We talked about parental leave, the summer and fall, how our baby would get along with our cats (and vice versa). We had a lot of hopes for her. And then in the blink of an eye almost, she was gone.

In some ways, I wish we could go back to that mindset. Even when I got pregnant, I knew the road would be long and scary and not guaranteed.

I know that right now you feel like it would be precious to have a scan image, but when the pregnancy doesn&#39;t work out it can be a really painful reminder. Internet hugs from me &lt;3</p>

<p>I&#39;m very sorry for your loss. It was the most difficult period of my life.</p>

Our best friends are pregnant, they told us a few days ago. They are early on and said that they'd want our support if anything happened. They were so excited. We had never told them about our pregnancy and miscarriage at 10 weeks. At this point I can't even remember why...we just didn't tell anyone. It's been two months. 

When they told us, they came to us to share in a big, happy moment. We froze on them. It took everything I had to not ball my eyes out. I don't know if I even smiled. I wasn't asking questions. They knew something was wrong. I didn't want to taint their happy moment with my grief by telling them, but it was too late. We ruined that moment for them. Ruined it.

The next morning we got together and told them about the miscarriage and told them we were sorry and that we're happy for them. I think I forgot to tell them why hearing their news made me upset. I'm genuinely happy for them and I hope they know that. I can't imagine what it would've felt like to get that reaction from them had this been reversed, when I was early in my pregnancy and scared and excited and anxious. She's the one going they a big change right now, it's her body and it's their life that's about to change - she deserves the attention and support.

But in that moment when they told us, it hit me like a freight train that we never got our moment telling them about our pregnancy. We never got to smile with other people about our pregnancy. And it was impossible to pretend that I didn't know exactly what they're doing right now for tests, appointments, etc because I was just there a few months ago. It nearly broke me to hear them talk about when they're getting their first ultrasound, which is where I learned I'd lost the baby... alone because of covid. My heart dropped to the floor when they said that this was the first baby in our little friend family, knowing that my baby will be forever forgotten. Holding back, even though I clearly didn't do a great job at pretending, was one of the hardest things I've ever done - the pressure in my chest was unreal.

I've been in the midst of a horrible last two weeks with trigger after trigger and no break in between. I was non-stop crying before they had even told us. Not even just crying, I've been hysterical daily. I didn't think it could get any worse. 

I'm relieved that they know now, so the stress of the secret is gone. And if I cry, they'll know why. And they're amazing, they'll be gentle with what they tell us now. But I hate that they chose us to be their support system in this time and we turned that around on them in a flash, now they have to support us. I feel sick. 

And now I have to reconcile with the fact that I ruined one of the happiest moments of their life, the first time they announced their first baby to anyone. It'll always be tarnished by the horrible reaction we gave them. And I don't know how to make it up to them because I'm not even ready to smile yet. 

And I don't know how to make this time about them and not all about us. My grief is just so much bigger than my joy for them. So much. But their baby (hopefully) is here, and mine is gone. Mine is over. This should be about them now. And I don't know how to do that. 

This miscarriage has turned me into a person I don't recognize anymore. I have no control over my emotions or reactions. It's taken over my identity and I don't know how to get out. The idea of pregnancy isn't even happy anymore, it's tarnished with some of the worst feelings I've ever felt in my life. And now it's creeping into making me a horrible, horrible, horrible friend.

You're getting downvoted because honestly, your personal beliefs aren't informative. Those of us who have TFMR know that you don't *really* know what choice you will make until you're actually forced into the decision yourself. It's easy to say things like ""I would definitely terminate without a second thought"" or ""I just know I could never terminate."" But TFMR support groups have plenty of people who were deeply religious and told people they could never terminate until actually faced with the decision, and conversely there are plenty of people who pre-pregnancy cavalierly proclaimed they would terminate without a second thought who had second and third and fourth thoughts when actually faced with the decision. In fact, there's someone in my support group whose child had a poor prenatal diagnosis that they decided to carry to term because they couldn't live with the what ifs, but when their second child received the same diagnosis they decided to terminate--she and her spouse have faced the same choice TWICE and made different choices each time.    

Also, people who TFMR have to hear ALL the time from people who say, ""Well if *I* had to choose I would choose not to terminate, because I would love the baby no matter what!"" so we have knee jerk reactions to people who have never faced a poor prenatal diagnosis offering us their unsolicited opinion.

In the case of CDH, kids with mild cases might go on to lead very normal lives after surgery and graduating from the NICU, but moderate to severe cases might require long NICU stays, multiple surgeries, and intensive interventions and therapies in early childhood (speech, occupational, and physical therapy; long term and/or permanent use of feeding tubes and/or tracheotomy or supplemental oxygen were possibilities). Overall it has a 50% mortality rate and a very high long term morbidity rate, especially the more severe cases. The spectrum of outcomes is huge so until we had our most definitive imaging, we weren't sure if we had a mild case or a severe case.  

The things were considered in making our decision were:  
1. How much did we think having a child with intensive medical needs would impact our first child? Would he come to resent his sibling? In our case he would have been just shy of 3 years old at the time. He is autistic and speech delayed, so I would have been splitting my time between him and a medically fragile baby in a NICU an hour away during a critical period of his development, for potentially a 4-6 month NICU stay if not longer. We would have had to delay school for him because I wouldn't have been able to put him on the bus. An older child may be more capable of understanding what's happening and why their parents need to be away so often, but my child could not.   
2. Assuming our child survived her first few months of life, would we mentally be able to handle her needs if she turned out to be a ""worst case scenario?"" Would I be okay with never going back to work if she needed full time care? Would I be okay with potentially giving up any of our future plans? What would happen if my husband lost his job and therefore insurance, since we lived on one income? In the case of our diagnosis, I found blogs by parents with the same diagnosis, and ""worst case scenario"" kids who didn't die in the first few days or weeks of life often needed either night nurses or full time nursing care at home, needed to be kept isolated from other kids due to the dangers of acquiring even a common cold, and were in and out of the PICU.    
3. What would her quality of life be like overall? Even if she was one of the lucky kids who ultimately survived with few or no long term issues, would the trauma from the treatments required to save her life be worth it? In our case, if our baby didn't die in the first few days or weeks, she still would have required a long NICU stay where she would have been so fragile that it would have been months before we could even hold her. Multiple intubations and extubations were likely, multiple surgeries, and painkiller withdrawal were common. Even the healthier kids with this condition often required G tubes for years because they develop oral aversions due to how much oral trauma they experience as babies and refuse to eat.   

Ultimately we decided that our child's chances of surviving and leading a fulfilling life were too small. We weren't willing to roll the dice on the small chance we might end up with a happy, healthy child, because we might have given birth to a very sickly child who would have had to suffer greatly to have any chance of surviving, if she survived at all. We also weren't willing to gamble on having a relatively healthy child knowing that having a sickly child would have required us to sacrifice the well-being of our older child, who still really needs the attention of his parents and where parental involvement now might make the difference between him living independently or not as an adult.

There are no good answers. Every decision here sucks. And it's so unfair there's a time frame for a hugely tragic decision like this. I hope you find peace and clarity tonight to make the decision.

What my husband and I are facing is similar but also different. I was blindsided when I went to the anatomy scan for our triplets. Having higher order multiples meant NIPT wasn't available for us, so this was the first chance we had to note major issues. I have relatives who have had children with major medical issues that they kept. I've held one of those children while she cried about not wanting to be alive because she wasn't normal, seen another die young, and watched as the third one struggles through life after a transplant and a stroke. I also have a LC with autism and ADHD and even though he's healthy and happy otherwise, he has trouble every single day because of his needs and those needs are nowhere near what these three other kiddos face. Needless to say, quality of life is a huge factor in my decisions.

Baby A had severe IUGR, several soft markers for trisomies, and at least one clubfoot. Baby B appeared completely anatomically normal except for IUGR. Baby C had multiple severe brain defects that if they didn't outright kill her before birth would prevent any decent quality of life, and later scans would show evidence she'd had hemorrhagic strokes and was having seizures in utero. We opted to get amniocentesis done on all three at that time. With the combination of Baby C's issues being likely fatal and the fact that the other two would have a better chance at surviving if we did the selective TFMR on her, that decision was made much easier. We know we made the right decision for her. 

Baby A's amnio came back clear of any genetic issues the day before we terminated Baby C. We were facing a deadline and had to talk to our local perinatal hospice about his potential quality of life and what we could pursue with them if it turned out to be shitty after he was born to decide what we would have done if he'd had the trisomy they were anticipating. Based on what they told us, we would have opted to TFMR if it had been abnormal. It was a less certain decision than with Baby C, but we felt okay with it. We didn't want to put him through any pain or suffering and the medical options available after birth were ones we were less comfortable with than with TFMR. We're still thankful it didn't come to that.

Baby B though? The only anatomically normal one? Her amnio came back late. As in, one day before the very last day we could do do anything in our state without a special medical exception being granted. And it was abnormal.

There are no good answers. Every decision here sucks. And it&#39;s so unfair there&#39;s a time frame for a hugely tragic decision like this. I hope you find peace and clarity tonight to make the decision.</p>

<p>What my husband and I are facing is similar but also different. I was blindsided when I went to the anatomy scan for our triplets. Having higher order multiples meant NIPT wasn&#39;t available for us, so this was the first chance we had to note major issues. I have relatives who have had children with major medical issues that they kept. I&#39;ve held one of those children while she cried about not wanting to be alive because she wasn&#39;t normal, seen another die young, and watched as the third one struggles through life after a transplant and a stroke. I also have a LC with autism and ADHD and even though he&#39;s healthy and happy otherwise, he has trouble every single day because of his needs and those needs are nowhere near what these three other kiddos face. Needless to say, quality of life is a huge factor in my decisions.</p>

<p>Baby A had severe IUGR, several soft markers for trisomies, and at least one clubfoot. Baby B appeared completely anatomically normal except for IUGR. Baby C had multiple severe brain defects that if they didn&#39;t outright kill her before birth would prevent any decent quality of life, and later scans would show evidence she&#39;d had hemorrhagic strokes and was having seizures in utero. We opted to get amniocentesis done on all three at that time. With the combination of Baby C&#39;s issues being likely fatal and the fact that the other two would have a better chance at surviving if we did the selective TFMR on her, that decision was made much easier. We know we made the right decision for her. </p>

<p>Baby A&#39;s amnio came back clear of any genetic issues the day before we terminated Baby C. We were facing a deadline and had to talk to our local perinatal hospice about his potential quality of life and what we could pursue with them if it turned out to be shitty after he was born to decide what we would have done if he&#39;d had the trisomy they were anticipating. Based on what they told us, we would have opted to TFMR if it had been abnormal. It was a less certain decision than with Baby C, but we felt okay with it. We didn&#39;t want to put him through any pain or suffering and the medical options available after birth were ones we were less comfortable with than with TFMR. We&#39;re still thankful it didn&#39;t come to that.</p>

<p>Baby B though? The only anatomically normal one? Her amnio came back late. As in, one day before the very last day we could do do anything in our state without a special medical exception being granted. And it was abnormal. Mosaic diploid/tetraploid abnormal, predominately tetraploid. The genetic counselor and the geneticist told us we could likely get the medical exception if the results were correct because of the seriousness of tetraploidy. But they also told us that since she was not showing any anatomic abnormalities there was a chance the abnormal results were due to culture artifact and she was actually a healthy diploid baby, and that the testing to redo the results was risky for infection, preterm labor, and fetal demise.

Myelomeningocele with chiari 2 malformation. Our sons brain ventricles were already severely enlarged and abnormal articulation of his lower limbs was seen.

We live in rural NNY with no specialities for a pregnancy of that sort or what a child with those diagnosis would need. 

We had literally just closed on a house and were in the process of renovations, also I am a sahm to a 3 year old and SO owns a small business. We are VERY tied to this area and cannot move. I also couldn't logically move to another state for closure surgery and to live alone for the remainder of a pregnancy. At that time my kid was still freaking nursing and had never been watched or left with anyone else. 

We planned our son and wanted him desperately. 

I fought hard with my heart VS logic. 

Ultimately it was a quality of life issue for the entire family. I am a nurse, I worked for 10 years before my daughter was born. I've worked in adult homes for people with disabilities. Even considering needing to put my son in a home like that one day is absolutely terrifying. 

His lesion was very large. We're talking potential breathing issues, swallowing issues, mobility issues, bowel and bladder issues, I mean I can't even sit here and type out all of the complications. It's literally immediate and lifelong medical intervention. 

The whole freaking point of prenatal testing is to be prepared and make a decision. That's why I accepted it. 

I would have done anything to make my son healthy but he wasn't and I logically understand what life would look like for him and the entire family. I don't want to sacrifice my families well being. I don't want to worry and struggle for the rest of my life and let's not even get into what I've read about what some of these children deal with, such as LIFELONG CHRONIC PAIN. Vent malfunctions and revisions, cord tethering and detethering surgeries. What if he needed a wheelchair? Does anyone realize what it would involve to make a 100 year old house wheelchair accessible? 

A woman I know did indeed keep her son with the same diagnosis. She is over 1 million in medical debt now. 

Sometimes life fucking sucks and we have to chose the hard path. 

I didn't just want a baby. I wanted a baby I could give a good life to. That isn't my definition of a good life. 

I'm 36. We were going to be done. We want another baby to complete our family so badly. I still made the decision to TFMR knowing I may never get another chance to have a healthy baby, but I cared about my sons potential quality of life more than my own needs. 

RIP Lincoln. 

OP, I hope this helps. I'm not sure what I would do if this happened again because our lives are in such different places. One thing I do know is each woman and family is different and what's right for one isn't for another.

I haven't had to face the choice of having to TFMR, but what you say here is exactly what my husband and I discussed in the early weeks of my pregnancy. We knew if we found out before birth that she had fatal or life-limiting problems, we would terminate. We are not able to be the parents of a special needs child who cannot function on their own.

Our own child was born at 22+2 and our hospital did not provide medical intervention for her.

I read about a small study wherein 78 22 week infants were given medical intervention after birth. Of those 78, 18 survived. Of those 18, only 7 developed into typical children with no lasting effects. That's a 9% chance. The other 11 who lived had moderate to severe life-limiting disabilities.

Sometimes I do wish that our daughter could have been given a chance at life by being placed in the NICU. Other times, I'm glad the decision was taken away from us, because it would have been a difficult one to make.

TFMR is an experience I don‚Äôt wish on my worst enemy and was the loneliest most heartbreaking thing I have ever endured. That said, I‚Äôm on the other side of it now and hope I can shed some light for you. 

Our diagnosis did not come until nearly 24 weeks and while it wasn‚Äôt a chromosomal problem, it wasn‚Äôt lethal either and we had literal hours to make a decision with what little info we had due to laws in the USA. We found out at our anatomy scan that our baby had Spina Bifida. While it was very small, it was still the most severe form of Spina Bifida and the MFM dr really could not give us solid answers on what kind of life he would live. Beat case scenario he would had potty issues his whole life, worst case he can‚Äôt walk. It was a big fat question mark and left us feeling so scared and hopeless. 

We ultimately knew we were not cut out to be parents of a special needs child. We have a living child already and we knew in our hearts how life changing this would be and how we couldn‚Äôt fathom signing up for living a life of potential pain, heartache, and suffering for all of us, including our son. I couldn‚Äôt bring him into this world knowing he would face problems his whole life. I opted to break my own heart now instead. 

We are a few months out from this experience now and neither of us have any regret about our decision. We knew in our hearts it was best for everyone. We were devastated and the few weeks after were some of the hardest and darkest of my life, but I think about how terrified I was at the outlook for our lives had we not had the TFMR and I find peace that it‚Äôs not the life we all have to live. 

Again I am so sorry you find yourself in this situation. Should you decide to move forward, I highly recommend you join us in the Ending A Wanted Pregnancy private Facebook group. You can request an invite from the website (another resource I recommend for you now and later). The women in that group have been a lifesaver for me.

There is so much conflicting information out there on when to start TTC. My doctor advised waiting one cycle to try again after my natural miscarriage around 6 weeks. I did the same thing with checking the internet. I have read about more recent studies that show better outcomes for babies conceived in the first 3 months following a loss. I also read that the usual reason to wait is to help date the next pregnancy. In addition to all this, I wanted so badly to be pregnant again and it was hard to think about trying to prevent something I wanted so much. So we started trying again immediately and were successful before I had a period. I am now 29 weeks. I was temping which was really important for dating the pregnancy since I didn‚Äôt ovulate until cycle day 40.

There is so much conflicting information out there on when to start TTC. My doctor advised waiting one cycle to try again after my natural miscarriage around 6 weeks. I did the same thing with checking the internet. I have read about more recent studies that show better outcomes for babies conceived in the first 3 months following a loss. I also read that the usual reason to wait is to help date the next pregnancy. In addition to all this, I wanted so badly to be pregnant again and it was hard to think about trying to prevent something I wanted so much. So we started trying again immediately and were successful before I had a period. I am now 29 weeks. I was temping which was really important for dating the pregnancy since I didn‚Äôt ovulate until cycle day 40.

I hear you about wanting to get back to the gym. I work out at home even pre-COVID, but I'm eager to start up some kind of exercise routine now that the bleeding finally stopped.

I went to an RE a year and a half ago because I was concerned about luteal phase spotting. I'd spot for 3, 5, or more days sometimes before I'd finally get my period. I thought I had a progesterone problem. He ran some blood tests to test for PCOS markers and did a saline sonogram and it turned out I had nothing abnormal. I even tried vitex for several months and that didn't help. So I gave up worrying about it and figured it was just something that was unique to me. The spotting continued all the way up through me getting pregnant. I never tracked ovulation before the cycle I got my BFP, so I don't know if I had a short luteal phase. I suspect cycle 1 was a chemical because of the weird period I got and then didn't ovulate until CD20 in cycle 2.

I've read 750-1,000 mg for Vitamin C, and 50+ mg of B6. I wouldn't take more than 100 mg of B6 because it can cause nerve damage in high quantities. I try to take my vitamins as chewies, capsules, or sublinguals for better absorption.  

I forgot to add I also take DIM to facilitate healthy estrogen metabolism. It doesn't lower estrogen but helps your body flush out excess/bad estrogen. There's basically no info out there for taking it while TTC, though. I took it to support a healthy cycle before TTC, and never stopped until I got my BFP in December. I restarted it a few days pp. 

I have never taken NAC or Myo Inositol. I'd need to read more to decide if it's something I want to add.

I am hoping I can get an on time period even without ovulating this month because I‚Äôm not that will happen. My RE wants me back in her office during my period for a saline sonogram today check my uterus before our next IUI. I might look into the extra b6 and C you discussed since I had a short luteal phase before progesterone support (10 days typically). I plan to use progesterone again when we TTC but it can‚Äôt hurt! </p>

<p>Have you ever taken NAC or Myo Inositol? I don‚Äôt have PCOS and most of the research is around that using those. They are said to support healthy ovulation and androgen levels but I haven‚Äôt started them yet.</p>

I am pregnant again and am around 12 weeks now. I decided against getting the Doppler.

First, it‚Äôs very hard to hear your baby‚Äôs heartbeat during the time period you‚Äôre talking about. You‚Äôre more likely to not hear it and feel stressed.

Second, at a certain point, I‚Äôve come to realize nothing actually reduces anxiety except for working on your own mind. The things that ‚Äúreassure you‚Äù only do so for about a second, then the anxiety comes back.

I had an ultrasound every week from week 6 to week 10. Not only did each appointment spike my anxiety, but the moment I got home I would start to worry again. NOT going in every week and instead working on calming techniques and avoiding reading so much medical stuff has been better.

I was also insanely angry and jealous too when it happened to me; I too thought ""Why me?"".  Even though I had SCH, I had seen a HB, but then it was gone within days.  It was my first pregnancy and obviously not the way I wanted it to go.

One thing I have tried to learn through this process is that other people's success and journeys don't have any impact on your experience - there are people who have had MC who just don't speak about it.  For me, no-one (apart from family) even knew that I was pregnant, even though I got to 9+w before it happened - to date, I have only told three people outside of that what I went through, and this is only because they are work colleagues who needed to know about my absence for my recovery, or that I trust.

Personally, I would definitely confide in someone if they told me they had had a MC, but everyone is different.  I will not be telling people I am pregnant if I am successful again until it is obvious, so that's kind of a similar thing if you flip it around.  I know it's hard when you're raw and looking for solace, but other people are not entitled to give out their personal information to others.

As other people have said - you also don't know about their lives and other trauma they've been through.  Just because someone hasn't had an MC doesn't mean they haven't struggled with numerous other things that perhaps you are lucky enough to be able to take for granted.  I try to count my blessings in that I have a stable job, home, husband and family who care for me; I have suffered this one set-back, but it doesn't define or make all of who I am.

Why not be the example you want to see, and talk about your MC?  I know that when things are back to normal, I want to speak openly about MC at my workplace.  It is very supportive of employees doing talks about emotional issues, mental health, illnesses etc so I hope I can shed some light on this from my own experience.

Her theory is that the MTX strips your body of the folic acid needed to create healthy eggs, so she wants to know that a)the MTX has completely cleared my system and b)I&#39;ve had the time to rebuild my folic acid to ensure healthy eggs for retrieval.</p>

<p>So sadly there is no hard and fast answer and it depends on your and your RE&#39;s tolerance for risk.</p>

<p>Also, <a href=""/r/EctopicSupportGroup"">r/EctopicSupportGroup</a> is a fabulous sub. I probably made 50 posts there last month.</p>

In term of ivf, if you have methotrexate it might well put things on hold. A lot of doctors will ask you to wait 3 months to ttc, because the methotrexate depletes folic acid.

Also - I was doing a little experiment by taking multiple photos of tests at the same time so this photo is a little wonky lol, oh AND it says ""CD5"" even though that was CD39 for me when I ovulated because unfortunately this app doesn't account for longer cycles and reset me at 35 days. Which is frustrating but so be it.

I actually haven&#39;t even gotten my period yet, but I do have very long cycles generally. I have been tracking though, and got a positive LH strip on day 39 of my cycle. My strips aren&#39;t necessarily darker than the control line, but as dark as the line. I always go by CM and strips, I also use the Clue App and while it&#39;s great to log info it never predicts the right ovulation window for me.

Definitely always make sure you stick with the same holder once you're in a cycle, because the big part of using digitals is that it sets your baseline and tracks your results against that, so if you switch part way through or before you get a Peak, it loses that data.

If it gives you some reassurance, I did not do any sort of tracking/monitoring in the time whilst I was waiting for that first period to arrive.  I did have a private scan on May 2 just to make sure everything was OK after surgery, and the sonographer told me it looked like I was about to O, so my husband and I DTD EOD for a while, but I have no idea when/if it happened, although due to the CP situation I think I did at some point.

So just to clarify, your loss happened on 6 May, meaning that you're on CD29 atm, and you started CBAD around CD20?  If your cycles pre-MC were 37 days, would you have expected O to have been around CD17-18 or later than that?  Either way, I want to tell you to not be concerned if this cycle you're in at the moment is a bit out of the ordinary - it's very, very usual post-MC because your body is essentially having to recalibrate.

Separately, I know exactly how the wait for your period to return, and the desire to start again (but knowing where you are in your cycle), can be agonising, but if you're still under the time-frame that you would've expected it to arrive historically, it's totally possible that it could come back bang on time as you've said.

My due date would have been 10th of June and just like you I really hoped I would be pregnant by now. I've been seeing a therapist lately and she has helped me tremendously. Obviously, these things may not be applicable to you, but they are helping me a lot, so I'll try to share best I can:

- try to work on a positive mindset. I'm tackling this from a few different angles. First, I searched for a positive phrase that resonated with me. For me it's ""one day I'll hold my child in my arms"". I wrote that on little notes and distributed them in our flat so that I'm seeing them often every day. Second, I started meditating. It's just a couple of minutes every day but it helps me stop my thoughts from spiraling downwards on hard days. Third, try to find the things that you enjoy in life and fill your life with them as much as possible. This one is really tricky with COVID going on, but even just making holiday plans or planning a hiking trip takes my mind off of TTC effectively.

- be open with family /friends about how you feel. Coincidentally we are going to be staying with my family for my due date and my sister is pregnant. It was really hard for me to tell her that it was my due date (honestly, nobody but me seems to remember our care!) and that I probably wouldn't want to see her on that day. And she understands and accepts that. And in hindsight it's a weight lifted off my shoulders. Also I had to tell my husband that this day is going to be hard for me and I will need him to support me. It hadn't really occurred to him.

- lastly how to cope with the day itself. Ask yourself :what do I want that day to look like? Do I want it to be just like any other day? Do I want to do something special? For me it was clear immediately that I don't want to work on that day, I just can't see myself holding it together at work. So I took the day off. I also want to do something to to remember my unborn baby on that day. I'm not entirely sure yet what that is going to be, but I thought about writing a letter, maybe tying it to a balloon to send it off or maybe not sending it at all. Other things that I've considered but that didn't resonate with me are : plant a tree, do a really big shopping trip, donate to charity, treat myself to a spa day. Whatever works for you will be good, just having a plan for the day feels really good to me.

All of that said, I can't recommend therapy enough. I didn't really want to believe that I ""needed"" it, when in hindsight it would have made my life so much easier if I had started sooner.

In my successful cycle, I had the same, with my Peak on CD14, so it would give me a real boost to see a repeat tomorrow and know that my body has returned to a rhythm that previously heralded positive things.  However, this is only my first proper cycle post-MC, so I appreciate it all might still be a bit screwy or could&#39;ve changed totally.  Either way, I&#39;ll be very happy to see a Peak at all, ideally before the end of the week.
