Then today as well, we went to a fair in town and I kept seeing pregnant women and babies and strollers (I have the urge with every stroller I see to look inside if the baby is about the same age our girl should've been), and I broke down again. But it only took a little while and I still managed to enjoy the fair after that.


I also got very annoyed with both my MIL and my mum. My MIL made a snarky comment about how she is ""still waiting for this year's Christmas card"". WTF? It took every thing I had in me not to flat out tell her we had other things on our minds past Christmas holidays. I didn't even like GETTING Christmas cards this year. She probably didn't mean it that way, but why the fuck would you say something like that?? It's April!! If she's still talking about CHRISTMAS cards, it must REALLY bother her, and if it REALLY bothers her, she should have already thought about why we didn't send cards this year. I don't get it. I didn't get along with my MIL even before our loss, but now things are even tenser than before and I can't bring up the energy to deal with it.

My own mum, she tries to be helpful by telling me to not give up hope, then tells me a story about how someone I don't even know had IVF 9 times and multiple miscarriages before becoming pregnant with her 6yo son and now she's 41 and got pregnant naturally, so like, don't give up hope...???

Today feels like a weird day for me because I‚Äôm just remembering last easter and being about 2 months from my due date, and feeling both ready and completely not ready but also excited and very tired and physically miserable. Now I‚Äôm in the exact same position‚Äî csection is 2 months from today, and I‚Äôm very tired and physically miserable and ready and not ready but the excitement is crowded out by fear and anxiety about this baby just coming out alive.

My brother lives about an hour away from me, and my sister lives a few states away but had her family in the area for their spring break this week, so we all spent the day at my brother‚Äôs yesterday so that the kids could all do an egg hunt with their cousins and play all their energy out together. My sister, who is about 10 yrs older than I am and is one of those high maintenance people who does not think she is high maintenance, kind of cornered me at one point while we were alone. Even though I was pretty clear in setting a boundary when we announced this pregnancy that discussing it was not a comfortable thing for us, she still asked, ‚ÄúSo how are you feeling about the next two months?‚Äù I bristled. First of all, my feelings are so complicated that they aren‚Äôt even really possible to articulate. Second of all, my sister is often trying to get into deep heart-to-heart talks that just aren‚Äôt really a hallmark of our relationship, although they were when I was like, six. I feel like the dynamic of our relationship has naturally shifted as I grew but she didn‚Äôt quite catch onto that and is still flummoxed, 25 years later, as to why we don‚Äôt have the same open lines of communication we had when I was a child. On top of that, because of the age difference, the open communication was one sided‚Äî obviously a 6 year old was sharing way more with a 16 year old than vice-versa. That dynamic has not really shifted‚Äî the expectation of openness is on her end and the burden of sharing on mine, and I don‚Äôt particularly feel as entitled to her inner workings as she seems to feel to mine. And then on top of THAT, we rarely see each other. So she pops into my life once or twice a year and seems to think we can have an open book relationship, and that‚Äôs just not how it works for me. If you aren‚Äôt going to cultivate this regularly, then I‚Äôm not going to view you as someone I can spill my guts out to. (Please understand, these are all feelings from my own perspective. I acknowledge her reality may be different and it‚Äôs just as likely she‚Äôs really just trying to ask about the non-superficial things in my life and is just doing so in a way that doesn‚Äôt work for me and my natural methods of communication.)

So anyways, I just answered that I wanted to get through the next few months, because that‚Äôs the most non answer answer I can give and I‚Äôm always looking for ways to just shut these conversations down as quickly as possible while also trying to avoid acrimony. And then she asked, ‚Äúbut all your appointments have been normal, right?‚Äù

This is just the worst question. I never know if people are bringing it up to reassure me, or to reassure themselves. Maybe it‚Äôs a little bit of both. But all my appointments with Sam were normal until I got to the hospital and he was dead. So it‚Äôs not reassuring to me that my appointments have been normal thus far, and I resent when people seek reassurance from me because I don‚Äôt think they should get the benefit of any reassurance when I don‚Äôt and I don‚Äôt think they should walk away with any sense that pointing out the faulty logic of good appointments=healthy baby made me feel the slightest bit better about the entire pregnancy as a whole.

<p>So anyways, I just answered that I wanted to get through the next few months, because that‚Äôs the most non answer answer I can give and I‚Äôm always looking for ways to just shut these conversations down as quickly as possible while also trying to avoid acrimony. And then she asked, ‚Äúbut all your appointments have been normal, right?‚Äù</p>

<p>This is just the worst question. I never know if people are bringing it up to reassure me, or to reassure themselves. Maybe it‚Äôs a little bit of both. But all my appointments with Sam were normal until I got to the hospital and he was dead. So it‚Äôs not reassuring to me that my appointments have been normal thus far, and I resent when people seek reassurance from me because I don‚Äôt think they should get the benefit of any reassurance when I don‚Äôt and I don‚Äôt think they should walk away with any sense that pointing out the faulty logic of good appointments=healthy baby made me feel the slightest bit better about the entire pregnancy as a whole.</p>

<p>Sigh. I just wish people would pretend to completely ignore my belly. I don‚Äôt want to talk about it. </p>

I had opted for IV sedation because I wanted this thing to be as easy as possible.  They couldn‚Äôt get an IV, which isn‚Äôt unusual, I have bad veins. I actually do IVs waaaay more often than the nurse doing mine so I gave her a few tricks for veins like mine, but they didn‚Äôt work. So I went ahead with 10mg diazepam and 10mgs oxycodone by mouth, then they left me for about 20 minutes for it to kick in. I was pretty loopy by then and said let‚Äôs get on with it.  

Y‚Äôall....  I have a *super* high pain tolerance. I‚Äôve had some gnarly injuries in my time and almost never take pain meds, but this shit HURT. Numbing my cervix was fine, dilating was mildly crampy, but the swishing around of the wand to dislodge the tissue was killer.  I was gripping the table and shouting and then apologizing and then crying about how it wasn‚Äôt supposed to happen like this.

When it was all done I apologized again and they both hugged me and said they were sorry we‚Äôd had to meet under these circumstances. 

My mom had accompanied me but I didn‚Äôt ask her to stay for the procedure because she doesn‚Äôt do medical stuff well, and I‚Äôm glad she didn‚Äôt because she would have been more traumatized than I am. 

After it was done they left me to rest and I sobbed and sobbed and got it all out, and then I felt some better so I called Mom to come back and called my partner to tell him it was over and I was okay. 

We got to leave almost right away, that was nice. I slept on the 45 minute car ride home. When I got home I talked with SO for a bit. He‚Äôs the only one I‚Äôve told how awful the procedure was other than you guys. I think my mom wouldn‚Äôt be able to handle the knowledge, SO and I can just work through my healing together and that will be fine. 

Anyways, so then I napped a bit with my cat as a heating pad (‚ù§Ô∏è) and honestly woke up feeling like a new person. I‚Äôve had almost no cramping, less than a period, and not even a pad‚Äôs worth of bleeding.

Sending you a big hug, because I have been there. It sucks. That day was the worst day of my entire life, and I am still not always sure exactly how I made it through. You are stronger than you think for getting by right now, you really are. 

I have a one-year-old daughter born in early 2017 after losing a son in 2014 at 22 weeks to IC. All of my pregnancies were the result of treatment of infertility, and the interim I had three ectopic pregnancies, lost my tubes, and needed IVF to conceive again...so the fear of losing my daughter was insanely high. Keeping a baby for me is really hard, and making a baby for me is even harder.

That said, I am the poster child for interventions working to bring a baby to term. My cerclage did its thing, and so did my Makena injections. Standard of care is cerclage after 12 weeks (once NIPT or NT scan results come back normal), weekly Makena injections at 16-36 weeks, biweekly monitoring until viability plus a third-trimester growth scan for some extra reassurance, and removal of the cerclage at 36 weeks. For me, this all progressed picture-perfectly - everything went as it was supposed to and I delivered my daughter only three days early. 

We are fairly certain, though,  after this pregnancy that I do in fact have an incompetent cervix. After the removal of my cerclage I dilated to 4 cm within a week and stayed there for a whole, then I went into labor at 39w4d...and my labor lasted three hours. My very quick labor told my doc that all along my cervix needed all that support, I was just one of the 90 or so percent of people that responded well to it. 

So that‚Äôs the first thing I‚Äôll try to reassure you about - that for 90% of people, a cerclage, progesterone, and monitoring WORK. You may jump to thinking ‚Äú10% of the time it doesn‚Äôt work!‚Äù But name me a medical intervention for another condition that has that high a success rate. Pretty few and far between. That statistic is huge! This is a serious problem that docs will tell you is very fixable. 

I will say that as a result at your MFM appointment you may even feel like your situation isn‚Äôt seen as a big deal to them. That‚Äôs because as serious as your risk of another loss is, MFMs see this all the time. Cerclages are very common to them, and they see them working perfectly day-in day-out. My own OB straight up told me at 8 weeks ‚Äúyou are bringing this baby home,‚Äù which sounded absurd and presumptuous at the time. My lived experience gives me the perspective to understand now why she felt so confident.  This stuff is borderline routine to a MFM, which should make you feel confident that your future is brighter.

That said, some good questions to ask about about the details of the cerclage procedure for you. The vast majority of women get a Macdonald cerclage, which is more than adequate. A TAC is a highly invasive surgery with huge risks and only marginally better outcomes for the vast majority of patients. A Shirodkar cerclage is also more invasive and just not done a lot anymore, as I understand it. But your MFM will be able to explain all of that in detail and reassure you why the type of cerclage you‚Äôre getting is right for you. (I asked mine to make me feel better about things I‚Äôd read on the internet. She did.) Additionally, you‚Äôll be able to hear what the surgery and recovery will be like and what restrictions you‚Äôll have after. I had a spinal for mine, but sometimes it‚Äôs done under twilight or general anesthesia. You may even get a say about what anesthesia you‚Äôre more comfortable with. (They wanted to put me under to ease anxiety, but I actually felt safer/more in control being awake. And that was cool.) I was on bed rest for about two days after the surgery...and then went to a wedding that weekend. I wasn‚Äôt on bed rest at all for the remainder of my pregnancy, but I was asked not to exercise and to stay off my feet as much as was allowed. I‚Äôm a teacher, so that‚Äôs not always easy, and my docs reduced my duties and helped me come up with a few easy accommodations (elevator access, extra rolling chair in my room) that could help. Worth asking about! I would also 100% talk about the Makena injections if your OB hasn‚Äôt brought them up already. Even without a cerclage, they‚Äôve been proven to prevent labor in about half of cases. They stink to get, but as we were IVF veterans my husband was able to give them at home (no reason you can‚Äôt be trained to do that too) which made it easier. 

That‚Äôs a very long and ramble response, but hopefully it gives you reassurance and a starting point for questions. Happy to give you more info anytime! Wishing you only good things going forward.

<p>I&#39;m a teacher who had a stillbirth at 20 weeks gestation before the start of the new school year - I took 2 weeks off before starting back and emailed my principal, deputy principal and head of department to tell them and said that I wanted them to spread the news in whatever way they felt was appropriate, so that I didn&#39;t get too many questions when I came back. I am close with 3 women at work who&#39;d known I was pregnant since about 10 weeks so I told them directly. Word got around quickly and my return was pretty seamless.

I've been lurking for a bit and think it's time I reach out for support and see if you have any advice.

My husband and I started ttc in August. I was on birth control for previous 12+ years. Got pregnant on our 3rd cycle - 1st cycle using easy@home opk strips. Had clear opk positive on cd18.

TW: we miscarried at about 6w. I was having pain on one side so Dr wanted u/s immediately. All was good - we saw the sac. That night I wiped and there was red blood. Hoped maybe I was irritated from the u/s. Next day i was having some light spotting and we had another u/s. This time we saw the heartbeat and let out a sigh of relief--thought we were in the clear. 3 days later I miscarried. 

I had a period 34 days after miscarriage. The next cycle was 39 days. It's hard to say what my normal is after being on birth control for so many years. The two cycles I had before I got pregnant were 31 and 34 days.

Here we are on CD 45 and counting with numerous bfn. 

Has anyone else experienced long or irregular periods after miscarriage? I called my ob and she said she's not concerned yet given how quickly I got pregnant before. I have hashimotos and hypothyroidism. I'm on synthroid to regulate. My levels have been slightly off lately and my endocrinologist has been adjusting meds accordingly.

I'm frustrated! I just want my period at this point. Dealing with the anxiety of the loss plus not knowing what my body is doing right now is so overwhelming!

Oh my gosh, of course she fills your thoughts right now.  I wish I could ease your pain somehow but I know that no one can.  This is your burden of love to carry. Someday, your oldest daughter will know that it's possible to experience the unthinkable, and continue living, because you are doing this.  If you start to feel like you can't go on - please talk to someone.   Try meds if you haven't done that yet.  Reach out to the people who are around you.  Do whatever you have to do to survive.   You matter.  You matter to your oldest daughter, and you matter for your own sake, and in you, your younger daughter's memory can live on.  You can be her hands in the world.

This is the worst time, I think.  The early weeks, months.  Just hold on right now while the fire of your pain and love burns away all the things that don't matter and leaves behind what does - your love for both your daughters, for your family.  And at first each moment is hell.  But it does get better.

Message me anytime if you want.

Did your daughter have massive blood loss at birth?  Ours did too and that's what most likely initiated the continuous bleeding (disseminated intravascular coagulopathy), although being part of the cooling study probably didn't help things.   But it was a mystery at first what had happened.  Eventually we were able to piece it together.  We requested records from the ambulance company which ended up confirming she had a visible cord compression - I'd felt her cord but it was in just the right spot to make me think I didn't know what I was feeling - and for a long time I had tremendous guilt about the fact that I didn't speak up immediately when the paramedics arrived.  Eventually I came to accept that it was just this horrible thing that we couldn't control but for a long time - oh god.  It was my fault and no one could convince me otherwise.  I could see the day all over again, but I'd try to change it.  Try to change this or that detail, to make it all come out ok, to save her.

Anyhow, I'm actually a NICU nurse now and injuries like the kind our daughters had are a special interest of mine.  I'm not an expert at all but I've done a lot of reading about it, cared for numerous babies with this type of injury - with all different kinds of outcomes - and had the chance to talk with different doctors about it, so if there is any clarifying information I could offer, please let me know.",[],,t1_dwjua9n,,0,,False,"<div class=""md""><blockquote>

My biggest tip is to keep your legs together when you move -- like take both off the bed at the same time before standing up. Take tiny steps so they aren't ever too far apart. When I walked on stairs I literally shoved my fist into the most painful spot as I moved -- it kinda helped. 

Unfortunately there isn't a lot to do for it. :( Thats the problem!!

But -- I am happy to report, and hopeful for you, that my pain went away the minute I gave birth.

* having 1 loss does not make you more likely to have another (unless you have some medical condition that is the cause)
* you did nothing to cause the loss
* Every pregnancy is different - different egg, different sperm, different embryo, different time in your life/body

After each subsequent loss of ours, we tried sooner because we felt we were wasting time waiting...and we kept putting all these rules up.

I am also starting to think about what I need for hospital and recovery days at home, both for comfort and nursing practicality. All of this is giving me anxiety.

It‚Äôs actually my second long-term opioid use in the past 3 years.

And it's really going to depend on your family circumstances. In my case, my mom and sister meant well in the month after my loss, but fumbled a *lot* of stuff.  So I just kind of asked for space, and really limited communication.  We don't live super close to my family, so the physical distance also meant I had more space.  

I'm not going to lie--waiting for the birth announcement of our niece was really stressful...maybe more than my EDD.  Someone in my parent support group told me that I ""might be surprised"" by feeling good when the baby arrived.  But when it came, I cried a lot.  More than my EDD, which turned out to be a happier day.  

I felt particularly like a bad aunt, because when my sister's first daughter was born, we made a trip to see them three weeks after.  Help out around the house, meet the baby, etc.  

This time around...technically we could do do that...but since I thought I would be spending this time with my own newborn, and the only reason I'm free and able to travel is because he died...yeah, I'm *so* not doing that.  I told my sister she could send a birth announcement, like she did with her first, but beyond that, didn't really want to see pictures or updates.  (She has a private Facebook group for her kids, so she can post to everyone there, and I can stay off FB til I'm ready.)

The contrast between our first and second nieces' arrival makes me feel bad/guilty.  But you know, we're going to be family for a long time.  If the kids look back years later, and one has a picture with Auntie at 3 weeks, and the other at 3 months or 6 months....they're not even going to notice or remember....  

I don't know how my sister feels about it.  She hasn't given me any pushback or said anything negative....  But even if she had...I'm just not beating myself up over it too much.  It might not be ideal for them, but well, I'm the one whose baby died.  It's not like I that was a choice I made...  And it's not the grieving parent's job to be the ""good sister"" or ""good aunt""...it's the grieving parent's job to take care of themselves and their partners.

Part of me feels like because my sister's daughter ended up being born one day before my son's EDD (she was almost a week late)...the future is going to be hard...first words, first steps, kindergarten, graduation....it's like a constant reminder of exactly what my son would be doing if he'd lived.  But part of me feels like as this niece grows into her own person, the tendency to compare will fade, and it will get easier to be that loving Aunt and not feel so conflicted.  That's kind of how I deal: This newborn period might not be ideal, but we got dealt a shitty hand, and years from now, it probably won't matter that these first few months of our niece's life, we weren't the perfect aunt & uncle.

(She has a private Facebook group for her kids, so she can post to everyone there, and I can stay off FB til I&#39;m ready.)</p>

<p>The contrast between our first and second nieces&#39; arrival makes me feel bad/guilty.  But you know, we&#39;re going to be family for a long time.  If the kids look back years later, and one has a picture with Auntie at 3 weeks, and the other at 3 months or 6 months....they&#39;re not even going to notice or remember....  </p>

<p>I don&#39;t know how my sister feels about it.  She hasn&#39;t given me any pushback or said anything negative....  But even if she had...I&#39;m just not beating myself up over it too much.  It might not be ideal for them, but well, I&#39;m the one whose baby died.  It&#39;s not like I that was a choice I made...  And it&#39;s not the grieving parent&#39;s job to be the &quot;good sister&quot; or &quot;good aunt&quot;...it&#39;s the grieving parent&#39;s job to take care of themselves and their partners.</p>

<p>Part of me feels like because my sister&#39;s daughter ended up being born one day before my son&#39;s EDD (she was almost a week late)...the future is going to be hard...first words, first steps, kindergarten, graduation....it&#39;s like a constant reminder of exactly what my son would be doing if he&#39;d lived.  But part of me feels like as this niece grows into her own person, the tendency to compare will fade, and it will get easier to be that loving Aunt and not feel so conflicted.  That&#39;s kind of how I deal: This newborn period might not be ideal, but we got dealt a shitty hand, and years from now, it probably won&#39;t matter that these first few months of our niece&#39;s life, we weren&#39;t the perfect aunt &amp; uncle.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t really think I have &quot;advice&quot;...I just wanted to share, so that in case you have some of the same feelings, you&#39;ll know your not the only one....</p>

40 years ago, my mom and aunts didn't have routine ultrasounds.  It wasn't available.  Much less at <= 8 weeks.  So ""missed miscarriages"" were only discovered in research settings.  For most women, you either miscarried, or you didn't.  There wasn't really a ""missed miscarriage.""

Even today, if a woman miscarries ""spontaneously"", chances are good that the clinic is not going to measure the embryo for its gestational age.

Yeah, I know.  I'm sorry your dealing with this, too.  

Personally, I can't handle it all together.  I'm over 35, so of course, I had it drilled into me that a miscarriage was likely & that trisomies were likely...  I felt so grateful when this pregnancy made it past each milestone....and then I lost my son to something ridiculously rare...nothing to do with my age, or something I did, or anything...On bad days, I feel robbed.  

So now I'm starting over one year older.   The risks for miscarriage and chromosomal issues are higher....and will be even higher if/when we want to try for a second child.  So I feel like on my journey to have the family I want, I'm guaranteed to have at least one more loss...  And because of the health issues my son had, I'm going to have to undergo all the same testing with subsequent pregnancies: fetal echocardiograms, amnios...I'm going to have to sit in those rooms, take those phone calls, field those results again.  

I dread it.  It's too upsetting to handle all together.  So, having done all the research I can do about things I can control, I've just decided to break things into tiny chunks, and only think about the chunk in front of me.  So right now, it's just TTC.  My bereavement counselor lent me a ""pregnancy after loss"" book, and when I got to the 2nd tri chapter, I was like, ""yep, that's 4-6 months away at the *earliest*...don't need to read this now.""  

Normally, I'm a ""face things head-on"" type person, but there's something to be said for lightening the load.  The other worries will still be there when the time comes.  I don't need to drive myself nuts taking it all on right now.

It was the same hospital, but a different doctor.

He did another ultrasound and said he can see there is still retained tissue. He asked what I wanted to do, and I said I'd rather avoid a D&C if I can, but I want this to be over. He suggested trying misoprostal a second time, even though the other doctor I saw thought there would be no point. Can't seem to get a consistent answer! He gave it to me and told me to take 2 pills today and 2 more tomorrow, and a prescription for some antibiotics.

I'm not thrilled but I'm not furious either. He ordered a repeat HCG test so I'll be going to collect that in a few hours to see if there's been a change in my levels since Monday and I'll decide what to do from there I think. I have another HCG test on Tuesday too.

Part of me wants to try the misoprostal again as it's a less invasive option (and cheaper) than the D&C, but I also remember how painful it was and I'm not looking forward to that AT ALL. I have pain relief and a hot water bottle and snacks etc. 

I know it's going to be over eventually, I just want to fast forward through this process.

1. So our latest miscarriage care was at an early pregnancy assessment clinic at our local hospital.  It also has an RPL clinic attached (many of the same docs and nurses).  After our most recent loss, we were referred to the RPL clinic.  The appointment was just over 2 months after the referral.  

As an aside, I had self-referred to a private fertility clinic quite a while ago. That appointment was about 4.5 months wait - but I was in the middle of my second MC when it came up.  We eventually got a referral from my GP, who told me the wait was likely because the fertility clinic had triaged me and wanted to give it a bit more time before they saw me (I had 1 MC and 1 CP under my belt, and less than a year of trying when I self-referred - I was just panicking). 

ETA:  we still have that appointment, I just keep putting it into the future.  I think we'll stay at the public clinic for all diagnosis, for now.  I just learned from our nurse at the public clinic that the private clinic we were referred to sends their patients who need a second opinion to our new doctor at the public clinic.  So I feel like I'm in good hands. 

2. All of the testing, consultation and diagnostics are covered under provincial health care.  That is the same as at the private clinic. Only treatment is not covered.

3. No - well, sort of. They don't count for the RPL diagnosis, but they do seem to count now that we HAVE an RPL diagnosis. Like, when I had 1 MC and 1 CP, they wouldn't see me at the RPL clinic.

When I started dry heaving, I called the doctor and got an emergency appointment, where they did an exam and an ultrasound and determined that I hadn't passed everything and I was scheduled for a D&C the next day.

Now, interesting side note is that because I had started bleeding, my miscarriage was now classed as an incomplete miscarriage, rather than a missed miscarriage, so I felt more comfortable with the D&C because the risk of scarring goes way down for an incomplete vs. a missed. So if I had it to do over again, I'd probably still opt for the pills, but make sure I had a follow-up scheduled sooner to check for retained stuff.

Anyway, my D&C was uneventful and I seem to have recovered (physically) quite quickly. My cycle isn't as picture perfect as it was pre-MC, but it's within a normal range and it came back quickly.

When I started dry heaving, I called the doctor and got an emergency appointment, where they did an exam and an ultrasound and determined that I hadn&#39;t passed everything and I was scheduled for a D&amp;C the next day.</p>

<p>Now, interesting side note is that because I had started bleeding, my miscarriage was now classed as an incomplete miscarriage, rather than a missed miscarriage, so I felt more comfortable with the D&amp;C because the risk of scarring goes way down for an incomplete vs. a missed. So if I had it to do over again, I&#39;d probably still opt for the pills, but make sure I had a follow-up scheduled sooner to check for retained stuff.</p>

<p>Anyway, my D&amp;C was uneventful and I seem to have recovered (physically) quite quickly. My cycle isn&#39;t as picture perfect as it was pre-MC, but it&#39;s within a normal range and it came back quickly. I won&#39;t know if I had any scarring unless it causes complications with a future pregnancy, but so far everything looks good. I just had a regular well woman exam a couple weeks ago and the doctor said everything looked good.</p>

> Basically, here's the deal: we have about a 50% chance of finding something to treat. Some of the issues they could find are treatable, as many of you know. Some of them are less treatable. If our karyotypes come back abnormal (about a 2-5% chance, I think), the only treatment is IVF with PGS testing (or trying and crossing our fingers).

So - I must ask. Where did this 50% number come from? From everything I've researched, and talking to my RE, about 75% of repeat loss goes without being diagnosed. Which is incredibly unfortunate. :( 

Also, if your karyotypes comes back abnormal, that does not necessarily mean straight to IVF -- it would truly depend on the abnormality that is found. Some can be found and not have much to do with your fertility or your losses. 

Also, where does the 70-80% chance of a live birth number come from? These are very confusing to me -- that seems completely subjective.

I have been in your shoes, actually hoping to find something wrong so they could hopefully treat me. It's not a pleasant place to be. I never thought I'd wish for a problem! :( 

The good news is that while 75% of repeat loss seems to have no reason (that we can find), a huge majority of people go on to have a living child. Unfortunately it CAN mean more losses.

My biggest suggestion to you, if everything comes back normal and you try again, is to have them track both your HCG and your progesterone from early on.  Also, many doctors suggest a daily baby aspirin -- as a ""might not help, can't hurt"" option. 

I would also do some standard CD3 testing and then again when you're ovulating -- this can be useful information.

I am glad you're getting testing and that you're feeling positive with things moving along -- its definitely reassuring! 

Let me know if you have questions/etc going forward, as I've been through this!

We live in a state with zero insurance coverage and have decided to keep trying naturally hoping that eventually we'll end up on the right side of the odds.

I haven&#39;t been doing a good job keeping up with you, but wanted you to know I also ended up with a &quot;low-normal&quot; AMH (1.01) which, as you said, doesn&#39;t cause miscarriage in and of itself, but was the only thing remotely interesting about my otherwise boring and normal labs.</p>

<p>My RE was very helpful in explaining the IVF+PGS option, and basically said that it was like comparing apples to oranges, but that it&#39;s not likely to get me significantly improved odds at a take-home baby with all the other factors considered at this point, but we could revisit it in the future. I agree it&#39;s scary--the option is basically nothing or everything.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Also not wanting to hijack this thread but we are in the same situation (including @rosegoldforever too perhaps--not sure how to tag on reddit, sorry if this is the wrong way). My AMH has fluctuated between .75 and 1.0. My RE also said that IVF with PGS is what he recommends because the lower egg quality/quantity equated to a 60-70% chance of miscarriage. Like rosegold says below, my research suggests that low AMH=poor retrieval results and that it might not cause miscarriage but it may mean that embryos have greater chances of chromosomal anomalies. We live in a state with zero insurance coverage and have decided to keep trying naturally hoping that eventually we&#39;ll end up on the right side of the odds. It&#39;s shitty that we are all in this situation but  also good to know others have had the same thoughts about options and possible outcomes. </p>

Hehe. 

I was not tested for either of those!  MTHFR I didn't push on because I'm already taking methylated b-vitamins (I take the Thorne prenatal and a methyl-b complex) and was told I could take a baby aspirin if it made me feel better (I do some days and not on others so it's obviously not going to make a difference either way), which seem to be the preferred treatment for it.  Factor V leiden I can't remember the reasoning for not testing--more likely to cause later losses maybe, which I haven't had?

I actually opted out of the karyotyping at this point because of the expense and because it probably wouldn't change what we'd do (continue to try naturally for a while anyway), though if I have another miscarriage, my RE stressed testing that pregnancy tissue (we didn't really have the option with any of the others or I would have) and that they'd be able to determine a parent translocation or similar from that.  From what I understand, the trisomy you discovered with your MMC might actually be a positive (?) thing--more likely to be a random issue.  It's also good that your losses are at different times--random, again.  I know that doesn't really make us feel better, but I guess it's true.  The only thing discovered in my basic CD3 testing was a low-normal AMH.  Are you getting any of the standard CD3 testing?  

It's been recommended a lot on this sub, but I only read *Not Broken* recently and really liked the way she dealt with explaining a lot of the RPL testing/theories, especially because her explanations seemed to align with everything my RE had told me--so it sounds like it's applicable to you, too!

Speculation on my part probably isn't helpful--you'll get better info when your test results come in.  

I will say that I did NIPT, and it wasn't until my son was diagnosed with something else (not an aneuploidy) that I learned about the caveats of NIPT.  

I'd definitely do it for future pregnancies.  But I had the impression that it was more reliable than it actually was.  It's better than a quad screen, but not as accurate as CVS or amnio.  And in general, the more rare the condition is, the less accurate.  (So accuracy for T13 < T18 < T21.)

I think every woman craves to be pregnant again immediately after their loss.  But we also have our grief.  Some women move on from that grief quickly, others not.  Everyone has their own timeline.  Pregnancy after loss is more stressful than pregnancy for someone who's never experienced a loss, so it's important to be in an emotionally good place before you TTC.

You aren't the first couple I know who's change their family timeline after the loss of an unexpected pregnancy.  I will, say, though, that the other couples I know shifted their plans up a year or two.  Six years is a lot.  It's great that you have support from family.  I just wonder....if you're both planning to go to school, and work on top of that, it sounds like your moms would have your babies a lot of the time.  Is that what you want?  

A colleague of mine had a mom who wanted her to have a baby while going to school, and basically said, ""Don't worry, I'll take care of the baby.""  And she was like, ""But the whole point of having a baby is that it's my baby.  I want that time with them.  I don't want them with someone else all the time.""  I understand the feeling of wanting a baby now (that's why we're all here), but kids are only babies once.  All those milestones only happen once, and it's worth thinking about how you and your husband want to be in their lives at that stage, and how you guys can best set yourself up for that.

> once I see that positive test, I‚Äôll figure out how much more I need to eat and eat that.

Upshot: you don't need to eat *more* during the first trimester.  You aren't ""eating for two"".  You're eating for you + something the size of a sesame seed or a golf ball.  Instead, you need to eat *better*--more nutritiously.  Even in my 4th month, my doctor wanted me to put on about 1 lb./week.  That's like 2-3 oz. per day.  Not a lot.  It's the second half of the pregnancy, as the baby gets bigger, where most of the weight gain should happen.

Or ""If I'm worried about my body not working, I'll see a doctor to find out one way or the other."" The more you practice having rational thoughts, the more automatic they come.

I just think it made us both see a different perspective. Both our moms would be ecstatic if we got pregnant now, they‚Äôve both emphasized heavily that we‚Äôd have all the support in the world, we would both go to school and work and have no worries about our baby.. I know we can do it. We can travel with a baby too. It might be harder but after losing my little one... I crave the stress and difficulty of children. 

Your last sentence really resonates. I have one living child and unexpectedly fell pregnant 3 months after she was born. It was such a surprise we weren't even sure how to feel until I miscarried around 8 weeks. Then I became obsessed.

<p>Your last sentence really resonates. I have one living child and unexpectedly fell pregnant 3 months after she was born. It was such a surprise we weren&#39;t even sure how to feel until I miscarried around 8 weeks. Then I became obsessed.

<p>I‚Äôve been waiting for my hormones to level out. I feel a little bit of a mess - overwhelmed, tired. But overall things are good. Happy she‚Äôs here and most of all healthy. My husband has been amazing and he‚Äôs so in love with being a dad. She‚Äôs been a good baby as we enter our 4th week! </p>

<p>Just wanted to say hello and I think of you all each day. Thank you or being a lifeline during a really difficult time. Hugs! üíï</p>

<p>Ps - today was my due date with my first baby. I had an ugly cry while new baby sleeps on my chest. I will say I‚Äôm happy she‚Äôs here but man, my loss still completely breaks my heart. </p>

For my first loss at 15+4 I did the misoprostol that was medically managed at the hospital. The nice thing about that was that the hospital managed my pain a lot better than they can when you take it at home and we‚Äôre able to handle any issues better. For instance, some women have trouble with retain products after the miso. When you take it at home it‚Äôs difficult to tell if you completed the miscarriage or not and then it can be days to weeks of waiting to determine if there are retained products or not. For me, having the misoprostol medically managed at the hospital they knew that I was just not delivering the placenta for some reason after the baby was out, so they were able to schedule for the d and c almost immediately. Unfortunately, I did have the d and c anyways and a lot of times I wish I would have directly gone that route. The benefit to having the misoprostol managed at home is that you can be home, in comfy clothing, eating good food and relaxing as much as possible. Pretty hard to do that in a hospital setting.

My third loss was also a blighted ovum, diagnosed at 8 weeks. They wanted me to wait two weeks and then have another scan to confirm there wasn‚Äôt any growth, but I miscarried naturally before that happened (about a week and a half later). That was by far more painful because I really only had ibuprofen to take and that didn‚Äôt do much, but I was glad I didn‚Äôt have to repeat a d and c.

I'm very salty, so my words should be taken with many grains of salt. I realize that my situation is the exception, not the rule.

Just a note on scarring: Some form of scarring is very common after a D&C (40-60%); however, in many cases, menstruation and fertility are not affected and no coercive surgery is needed. So, yes, you may have scarring. However, that scarring is more likely to be insignificant than severe.

Honestly, the choice is just so, so personal, and having a D&C is the emotionally easier, less traumatic experience, I think, especially since you may need a D&C after Cytotec anyway, but you'll just have to follow what you think is best. Discuss the options thoroughly, inside out and upside down, with your OB. Just note that OB's dismiss the risk of scarring because many patients are never diagnosed or move on to be diagnosed by a specialist or RE, so the OB's knowledge on prevalence is skewed.

It's possible that you had a CP.  Reasons for a CP and a miscarriage of a clinical pregnancy are often unrelated.  

It's also possible that your body is still just adjusting after your miscarriage.  For some people, cycles can be wonky for a while after a loss.  And it's not uncommon here for ladies to be disappointed one cycle, because despite symptoms, they got a BFN.

With a CP, the embryo starts to implant in week 4, but is generally lost in week 5 or 6.   If your period came early, then the timeline of conception and implantation would suggest that something didn't work out *very* early on.  Or that your luteal phase this cycle was too short to implant (something you could assess if you are tracking ovulation).  

The only way to really know if something is a very early CP, or just your body trolling you, would be to do some FRERs the next cycle that you feel like you're having pregnancy symptoms.  They're the only thing, short of a trip to the doctor's office, that can pick up very early pregnancies.  

Normally, I come down on the side of ""knowledge is power.""  But CP's are so common, that some people advise staying away from FRER's.  As in, such early losses are so likely, why put yourself through the mental stress?  But in your case, you're already going through the stress.  You might find its better to know either way (a BFN, or a BFP followed by AF, i.e. a definite CP) than go through this uncertainty.

So I've used miso twice, and had one D&C (after the miso didn't really work). 

I dunno.  It's all shit. I don't regret my D&C at all, and after having gone through all of my experiences, I would probably opt for a D&C right away if I ended up in that position again.  I found the waiting emotionally agonizing, and the D&C helped me move on more easily, I guess.  

I've had two miso experiences, and they were pretty different.  Both pretty intense, although the second time it wasn't really that painful - just so much bleeding. 

Who told you that risk of scarring is 25-30%? I was told less than 1%. If it was 25-30% I would probably not do it - not worth it.  There's a lovely redditor around who has been struggling with Asherman's, and it sounds awful.

It was a mistake, and I think really prolonged me getting back on my feet and back to normal. My most recent MC I asked for leave from work, basically, and took it, and it helped so much.

And then I've had cycles where I was certain I was not pregnant, but I definitely was. I don't trust my own gut feelings anymore on that one - there are just too many factors in all the TWW symptoms, for me at least.

For early losses, random chromosomal issues are often the cause. The more losses you have, the more likely this is *not* the explanation, but at 2 or 3 losses there's still a decent chance that this is it.

Are your thyroid levels within ""ideal"" ranges for women TTC? Typically they want TSH closer to 1, definitely less than 2.5, and they want T3 and T4 in the upper third of the ranges.

Is your thyroid problem autoimmune in nature (Graves or Hashimotos)? There's a link between the autoimmune aspect and miscarriage even when the thyroid levels are treated to within ranges. Some doctors recommend lifestyle changes or medications to try to ""turn down"" the autoimmune response.

Is low progesterone an issue? If you're tracking ovulation, are there 10+ days between ovulation and your next period, preferably 12+? Some doctors will prescribe progesterone after ovulation or with a positive pregnancy test. It's debatable whether it helps, but it's been shown to be quite safe.

Is high insulin or pre-diabetes a possibility?

Are you a healthy weight? Being underweight or overweight can both mess with hormones and make it more difficult to get pregnant and stay pregnant.

There are some rare issues that can cause recurrent early losses. Chromosomal issues in mom or dad can cause high rates of early loss, but they're very rare and expensive to test for. Also, the odds of having a healthy baby eventually are typically very good, so it's debatable whether it even makes sense to diagnose. Blood clotting disorders are not so rare, but it's unclear how they contribute to losses (especially in the 1st trimester). Some doctors will recommend trying baby aspirin without a diagnosis because again, might be effective and is pretty safe. Uterine abnormalities are fairly rare but require more work to diagnose - typically need a procedure called a saline sonohystrogram or a surgery called a hysteroscopy.

Like you said, there are often no answers. For couples with 3+ losses and for couples with 1 or more later loss, 50% never find anything wrong that would explain the loss. The good news for these couples is that the chances of having a live birth in the very next pregnancy are very good, >50%, and the chances of eventually having a live birth are even greater. It's hard to try again, but that's pretty much the most evidence based thing doctors can recommend.",[],,t1_dwblk5r,False,0,[],False,"<div class=""md""><p>I&#39;ve had so many cycles where I could swear I was pregnant, but never got a positive test. And then I&#39;ve had cycles where I was certain I was not pregnant, but I definitely was. I don&#39;t trust my own gut feelings anymore on that one - there are just too many factors in all the TWW symptoms, for me at least.</p>

<p>For early losses, random chromosomal issues are often the cause. The more losses you have, the more likely this is <em>not</em> the explanation, but at 2 or 3 losses there&#39;s still a decent chance that this is it.</p>

<p>Are your thyroid levels within &quot;ideal&quot; ranges for women TTC? Typically they want TSH closer to 1, definitely less than 2.5, and they want T3 and T4 in the upper third of the ranges.</p>

<p>Is your thyroid problem autoimmune in nature (Graves or Hashimotos)? There&#39;s a link between the autoimmune aspect and miscarriage even when the thyroid levels are treated to within ranges. Some doctors recommend lifestyle changes or medications to try to &quot;turn down&quot; the autoimmune response.</p>

<p>Is low progesterone an issue? If you&#39;re tracking ovulation, are there 10+ days between ovulation and your next period, preferably 12+? Some doctors will prescribe progesterone after ovulation or with a positive pregnancy test. It&#39;s debatable whether it helps, but it&#39;s been shown to be quite safe.</p>

<p>Is high insulin or pre-diabetes a possibility?</p>

<p>Are you a healthy weight? Being underweight or overweight can both mess with hormones and make it more difficult to get pregnant and stay pregnant.</p>

<p>There are some rare issues that can cause recurrent early losses. Chromosomal issues in mom or dad can cause high rates of early loss, but they&#39;re very rare and expensive to test for. Also, the odds of having a healthy baby eventually are typically very good, so it&#39;s debatable whether it even makes sense to diagnose. Blood clotting disorders are not so rare, but it&#39;s unclear how they contribute to losses (especially in the 1st trimester). Some doctors will recommend trying baby aspirin without a diagnosis because again, might be effective and is pretty safe. Uterine abnormalities are fairly rare but require more work to diagnose - typically need a procedure called a saline sonohystrogram or a surgery called a hysteroscopy.</p>

<p>Like you said, there are often no answers. For couples with 3+ losses and for couples with 1 or more later loss, 50% never find anything wrong that would explain the loss.

So maybe it&#39;s just better to not have another baby right now, or maybe ever. I need to want a pregnancy and a baby (ANY baby) from the situation what it is like right now, not how it was, because it&#39;s NEVER going to be the way it was supposed to be.</p>

<p>I&#39;m extra sad today because it&#39;s my brother&#39;s birthday, which is also the birthday of his twin sister who died a few days after birth. Five months out from the birth of my daughter all I can think about is how horrible it must have been for my mom and I feel guilty that all those years before I never really realised that. (I was my mom&#39;s rainbow, 5 years after my little sister passed away.)</p>

I fucking hate this. </p>

There is nothing like getting a devastating diagnosis for your child, and having to make a decision about their life.  The only parents who understand are other TFMR parents, and sometimes NICU parents who've had to make a decision to end support (which is essentially what TFMR is).  

For different reasons, I had an ultrasound when I was admitted for my induction.  I think the doctor administering it thought it would be hard for me, and eventually, she turned the screen away.  But at least for me, I wanted to see what I could of this baby I loved.  I wanted that extra chance to see him one last time.  And it's not something I think back on with pain.  Even though your ultrasound Tuesday is not a choice, and the people who mandate it are not doing it for compassionate reasons, I hope that your last time seeing your daughter, and everything about her that is beautiful, is similarly special.  

After my loss, there were two books I found helpful.  One was a small book the hospital gave us: *A Time to Decide, A Time to Heal*.  My husband and I read it a bit at a time, maybe an hour a day for a few days.  The second was *The Prenatal Bombshell* by Stephanie Azri and Sherokee Ilse.  This was a more in-depth book that I read after my loss.  Both have stories of other women who received poor prenatal diagnoses, cover a variety of circumstances, talk about grieving, challenges for couples, and finding a new normal in the future.  TFMR can be isolating--I found these books comforting and helpful. 

Much of the bereavement advice notes that having things by which to remember the baby helps healing.  Losses at 13 weeks can be hard, because you don't get to hold your baby, take pictures, etc.  (Some hospitals can do footprints, but sometimes this isn't possible.  You can ask.) But your journal for the baby will be part of those memories--evidence that she lived and she was loved.    

At the hospital, you may be asked about funeral or cremation arrangements.  A funeral home near our house had specific information on their website for babies <20 weeks gestation.  So this is definitely something funeral homes offer.  We brought some information to the hospital, and the social worker there did most of the work making the arrangements (and said there was a small fund to help offset the costs, if we needed it).  

In the time between finding out our son was very ill, and going in for the induction, we did the best we could to enjoy the time we had with him and make memories with him: took him on a hike, made him a nice dinner, fed him his grandparent's favorite chocolate.  And those memories have been a great comfort--especially as we've come to his due date.  This coming week is going to be very hard for you and your husband.  But I hope you can still make some good memories with your daughter.

There are guides to making observations online. 

The short version: Look at the toilet paper when you use the bathroom. If there is mucus sitting on top of the paper, pick it up and try to stretch it between your thumb and pointer finger. If it stretches more than an inch and it looks similar to raw egg white it's very fertile. If it stretches less than an inch and looks like half dried rubber cement or it's creamy like lotion, it's less fertile - but still a sign of approaching fertility. Everyday, record the most fertile observation. So if you see less stretchy mucus all day and then see stretchy mucus once, record that. 

Also pay attention to how it feels to wipe. Sometimes, the mucus will make the toilet paper glide, as if lubricated. This is a sign of fertility. Other days the toilet paper will feel rough or scratchy - a sign of infertility. Again, you might feel both in the same day. Record the most fertile.

Some women also chart sensation. You know how sometimes you can ""feel"" your period? There's a sensation of wetness? You can tune in to similar sensations for cervical mucus. Days of high fertility often feel wet and slippery throughout the day, days of lower fertility often feel moist, and days of likely infertility feel dry.

If you chart these signs, you can identify peak day - the last day of stretchy mucus and/or feeling slippery when wiping and/or feeling wet throughout the day. Ovulation typically happens plus or minus 2 days from peak day.

Like OPKs, mucus observations tell you that fertility is approaching but don't confirm that ovulation actually occurred. Sometimes the body prepares to ovulate but at the last minute backs down because the hormones aren't right. Temperature rises after ovulation and can confirm that it actually happened, or let you know that your body did not ovulate and will probably try again soon.

If you wanted to time the OPKs, I would probably start as soon as you see mucus in the first cycle. In future cycles, you can probably fine tune it to whatever you typically see 2-3 days before peak day. Personally, I don't bother with OPKs because I feel mucus and temperatures give me more information and are cheaper too.

Hope that helps! My husband and I have used the sympto-thermal method for 3 years to both avoid and acheive pregnancy, as well as to give my doctor more information about my cycles and health.

I had an appointment with my midwife yesterday, and she admitted to me that she thinks about me way more than she should. That made me feel good because I definitely have developed a minor obsession with her, too. Not in a creepy way, just in a harmless I-googled-her-and-sometimes-when-I‚Äôm-having-trouble-sleeping-I-imagine-she‚Äôs-rubbing-my-back-the-way-my-sister-did-when-I-was-a-little-kid-and-couldn‚Äôt-sleep kind of way. Maybe that‚Äôs weird, but she was one of the people that pulled me through the worst day of my life so I suspect that feeling such an attachment to her is not totally outrageous. (Right? Someone tell me I‚Äôm not crazy.) It is a big comfort to me to know that she is just as invested as I am in having this baby come out of me kicking and screaming.

My csection is scheduled for 10 weeks from today, and it sounds like my midwife‚Äôs plan is to be scheduled to work that day so she can scrub in on the team. She told me that way she can be there to help push the baby out and be the one to catch. This is such a lovely idea to me. She lovingly caught my last baby, and I can tell that she wants a better bookend to that experience just as much as I do. It‚Äôs such a sad thing that I went through, but it somehow makes me feel better to know that Sam left such an indelible mark on someone outside of my own family that she wants to be such a large part of the parallel experience.  

She suggested that the L&D nurse who was with me at Sam‚Äôs birth, who is the head of the perinatal loss team, be scheduled to be by my head offering some moral support. At first I wanted the midwife in that role, but I am equally satisfied with the nurse doing it (she was the other person who pulled us through that terrible day and has been there for us at our perinatal loss support group since) and so I‚Äôm actually thinking this is a really great plan. I know my husband will be in the room as well, and he was a champ during my first csection (which was unexpected and therefore terrifying for me) but I think it will actually be nice to have this nurse there for him, too‚Äî this will be a nerve wracking experience in so many different ways for each of us that I‚Äôm touched and relieved that we are being offered so much support.

I don‚Äôt know who the doctor performing the surgery will be, yet, but I‚Äôm just choosing to trust that it will be the person I need in that moment that day. I was hoping to have the doc who performed my postpartum D&C, because she took amazing care of me, but when my midwife asked her she already had a conflict. But she was touched that I had specifically requested her and had been so comforted by her care, so I‚Äôm at least glad she got a whiff of how much her presence meant to me when she ably assisted and corrected a postpartum complication that could have been so much more awful without her attention.

I went in for my 37 week appointment on March 6th and was measuring small so they squeezed me in for an ultrasound.

I cried a bit and asked the midwife it everything was going to be okay, if this was happening because I didn't drink enough water, etc. She was reassuring, but you know, no one can know for sure that everything will be okay.

I called my husband from the parking lot and cried some more. He eventually met me at the hospital and after learning that I was already 3cm dilated, that started me on pitocin. Labor went pretty quickly and she was born in the early hours of March 7th.

She had low blood sugar in the hospital, but other than that (and being so little, 5lbs 11oz) she's just perfect. I mean, all her little night time noises have started being less cute as my lack of sleep is catching up to me üòÜ, but I'm so relieved and grateful to have her here. 

I still have questions about why I grow such little babies and why my fluids were so low, but I'm not expecting the doctor to tell me much.

Thank you all for the enormous amount of support and understanding through this. It has meant so much to me.

I completely understand and the only thing I can say is to continuously forgive yourself and give yourself grace, and it will start to hurt less as time goes on.  

I am about 9 weeks out from a 20 week pregnancy loss (considered a stillbirth in my country, only just).  The first 6 weeks or so of my pregnancy were an absolute disaster. Not for the same reasons as you, but because my relationship was in the toilet - we had been trying for 6 months for #2 and it put a strain on us.  We had decided to stop trying, and lo and behold the one time we had sex that month we conceived.

We sought out couples counselling, communicated with each other, spent some time apart and eventually got to a better place where we were excited and happy about the baby, and our relationship stabilised.  We had about 8 weeks of relative bliss and then I started to bleed, didn't stop for 4 weeks, and finally had to be induced and delivered at 20w5d.  

I've been told over and over and over again that I was unlucky, that the SCHs I had would have resolved themselves in 99% of cases and that I just had the bad fortune of going the 1% way, but irrationally I can't help but think that ""wishing"" for a miscarriage in the early and dark days was what caused this to happen.  I know it isn't true - but I can't help it. 

Like I said - with time and some counselling I am feeling better about this but the thoughts still creep in.  I'm hoping they will keep getting better with time.

I'm commenting because I lost our daughter at 17 weeks spontaneously and delivered her. The cause for me was quickly determined to be incompetent cervix, which is a very unforgiving medical term.

In subsequent pregnancies, incompetent cervix can be treated with a cervical cerclage. It's a surgical stitch the helps keep the cervix closed to prevent funneling or effacement. There are a couple of different kinds, and each has their benefits. Cerclages are pretty successful, usually cited as an 80-90% success rate if it truly is incompetent cervix.

There seems to be a very small but vocal number of doctors who strongly believe that endometriosis causes an increased risk of loss.

I think it's very much a judgement call. Like you said, you've only had one doctor recommend this and his recommendations are known to be controversial. Many doctors would not recommend this at all. I  think it would be understandable if you wanted to cross it off your list, knowing that even if you found evidence of endometriosis it's possible that it still isn't your problem but why not remove it just in case.

For now, we aren't pursuing this. I had such an awful experience with anesthesia during my D&E so I'm not sure I'm up for another surgery from an emotional/sanity perspective. I'm also not convinced that it would explain our later losses - sudden fetal death in the 2nd trimester isn't a calling card of endometriosis.

This is so aggravating to me for a variety of reasons, presented here in ascending order of importance.

1. You can‚Äôt bank sleep in advance of an anticipated deficit. That‚Äôs not how sleep works. Stop telling pregnant women that that‚Äôs how sleep works. Obviously naps are great when you need them but they won‚Äôt offset sleep deprivation down the road.

2. I HATE when people just treat this baby like it is a given. We are ten months out from a full term stillbirth, and I have made it clear that we are equally prepared to bury this baby as we are to bring it home. It‚Äôs very triggering for me for people to just set out the expectation that everything will just be fine and that ‚Äúwhen the baby is here life will be XYZ.‚Äù I frankly don‚Äôt understand how anyone who knows our situation could be so callous as to assume that babies all get born alive and come home to deprive their parents of sleep by crying all night. (Also, I was just as sleep deprived postpartum with a stillbirth as I was postpartum with a live child. No one can look me in the eyes and tell me that wouldn‚Äôt keep them awake at all hours of the night.)

3. This is my THIRD pregnancy that has made it this far. I‚Äôm not new at this, I‚Äôve done this before two whole times, and I am aware that my body struggles mightily during the latter half of pregnancy while the baby usurps all my energy and resources. The exhaustion is real; I am basically in survival mode. In both of my prior full term pregnancies, the baby came out and my energy rebounded quickly (like, within days), even despite the sleep deprivation. Anytime someone mansplains or momsplains to me that things get harder when the baby comes out can fuck off. Physically, my life becomes immensely easier when the baby is no longer inside me. The much larger variable, in my view, is that I don‚Äôt know what emotional state awaits me.


I kind of lost my shit at my mom after this conversation because I really AM tired of hearing the same old platitudes that try to downplay my very real feelings of debilitating exhaustion, and hearing them for the third pregnancy is just too much‚Äî this pregnancy is already such a struggle every day for normalcy, having my feelings and my personal experience diminished like that just isn‚Äôt okay. 

Anyways, thanks for letting me vent and reading this far. (If you made it, haha.)

Don't know how to feel today.  My son's due date is tomorrow.  Husband's taking the day off, and we're going to revisit some of the things we did with him on our last day together.  Cook some things we'd been planning to cook for him (*in utero*) for Thanksgiving that we never got to make.  

But this week I've also had my sister's pregnancy hanging over my head.  Her due date was a week before mine, and each day, I've been expecting to get to the news that the baby was born...and days passed...and then with each day, I was also worried something would go wrong.  (Because those risks go up the longer passed due a baby is.)  

Well, the baby finally arrived today...And all I feel like is that I let go of the worries about late complications.  It's not even really relief... I thought I might feel a mix of things--people told me I might--but I just want to cry.  And I feel like a bad aunt, because I just feel sad/numb.  I don't feel happy.  (Whereas with my sister's first, we were.)  

Instead, I'm this bystander to all the celebrations and compliments and congratulations rolling in--and it just makes me cry more.  So much unbridled, assured happiness.  Not a whiff of relief, as if something could ever have gone wrong.  In November, after hearing what we went through--that our son had something that is never diagnosed by ultrasound--my sister was like, ""that's not scary to me"", is if it could never happen to her....and her whole experience and celebration continues to be in this bubble....whereas for me, not only am I childless, but I feel like pregnancy and birth are only going to be a series of getting past one worry after another...

I can't believe that every year, I'm going to be buying presents for this little girl's birthday--one day before my son would have been born.  And no one is ever going to be buying presents or cards for him.  And I feel like I have to keep all this to myself, because no one wants my son's death hanging over this new baby's life and her milestones.

Getting struck by lightening is more common than getting the condition my son had.  Today my brain refuses to compute what happened.... Part of me had been looking forward to tomorrow--celebrating our son...but now, if feels like it's going to be a hard day...

Please get yourself lots of support--bereavement counselor, therapist, parent support group for perinatal loss.  Even if you don't feel up to going (we didn't in the first two weeks after our loss), it's good to make contact so the support is there when you're ready.  

We say here that a loss is a loss.  And that's true.  But on top of that, you had what sounds like a pretty traumatic c-section experience (which even without a loss, I know, is hard).  And while barely post-op, you had to watch her fight for her life, and then make a decision in a short amount of time to take your daughter off life-support. You had to go home to the nursery all ready for the baby.  It's a lot to come to terms with, and it's okay if it takes time.  One set of parents in my support group went through some of the same things that you went through, and they're still coming to the support group 10 months after their son died.  These things are the hardest.  

Another thing that's hard is wanting to be pregnant again.  We all feel that way--even when we're grieving the babies we just lost.  But in your case, because of the c-section, you need to wait.  And the wait is hard--(and I appreciate the age-anxiety compounding that, because I'm over 35 too).  One of the facilitators of my parent support group was in your situation--lost her baby during labor with a c-section delivery.  She did not follow her doctor's advice to wait for the wound to heal, and in her subsequent delivery, her uterus ruptured.  Luckily, the baby was okay, but it put both their lives at risk, and if she could do it over again, she would have waited the full year.  After a loss, we all want to have control to prevent another loss--this is one thing that you *can* control (even if it's hard).  

Your feelings of being fearful about the next pregnancy are normal.  I'm also a worrier--I felt like I was living my pregnancy in 2-4 week intervals.  I waited until after the 20 week ultrasound was healthy to tell anyone I was pregnant, I was so worried the baby wouldn't be healthy....and then, after the baby was pronounced healthy at 20 weeks, the problems started being diagnosed.  I didn't even feel ""safe"" the first pregnancy--going through it again is going to be harder.  And maybe not just pregnancy, but if I think beyond that, I'm afraid of everything that might take a future child.  It's a common thing--and if you need your husband to listen and tell you that your fears are understandable, instead of trying to reassure you that what happened is rare, don't be afraid to ask for that.

I can't even imagine 7 losses, I am so sorry. I don't really know anyone around my age who has kids or even wants them, and I don't have any family. So the pregnancy itself was hard to talk about, and I think many of the people in my life just don't know what to say and have no idea how to relate right now. One of the worst things right now is that i'm still bleeding, and crying all the time, so i have basically no idea if I can try again etc. It's an incredibly painful limbo. It's a constant reminder of this horrible loss that's just weighing me down and ensuring I can't move on. I feel that, with how old I am, I can't wait at all. when I was in my master's in my 20's, the health center nurse told me I had been on Depo Provera too long to ever have children. When I was in my PhD and about to turn 30, another school health provider told me that it was ""now or never"" if I wanted to have children. I wanted to very badly, but a grad school stipend and the complete shitshow of dating in one's early 30s made it almost impossible, and based on those encounters I assumed I had a very low chance of getting pregnant anyway. 

Either way, I was so absurdly excited and now it's all gone. I guess I'll try again, but I don't think I'll be able to enjoy one second of it because all I will be able to think about is another miscarriage. I'm sure you understand! And I also feel a ton of guilt. I ""only"" had one miscarriage. Some people can never get pregnant. I got pregnant twice in a year without trying (TW: i hope there's no judgment here...the first time it was last January, the week my dad died, and I had been exposed to all kinds of shit cleaning the hoarder room he died in / cleaning up the blood etc., and I hadn't really consumed anything besides coffee and anxiety meds...and my SO and I had only been dating for 5 weeks...so we terminated and i feel horrible saying that here). Then this year I was pregnant again, so I was really excited since it felt like something positive was finally happening. I was pretty stupid that way. I told my SO that I never wanted to have sex again either. ",[],,t1_dw2kxdh,False,0,[],False,"<div class=""md""><p>Thanks. I can&#39;t even imagine 7 losses, I am so sorry. I don&#39;t really know anyone around my age who has kids or even wants them, and I don&#39;t have any family. So the pregnancy itself was hard to talk about, and I think many of the people in my life just don&#39;t know what to say and have no idea how to relate right now. One of the worst things right now is that i&#39;m still bleeding, and crying all the time, so i have basically no idea if I can try again etc. It&#39;s an incredibly painful limbo. It&#39;s a constant reminder of this horrible loss that&#39;s just weighing me down and ensuring I can&#39;t move on. I feel that, with how old I am, I can&#39;t wait at all. when I was in my master&#39;s in my 20&#39;s, the health center nurse told me I had been on Depo Provera too long to ever have children. When I was in my PhD and about to turn 30, another school health provider told me that it was &quot;now or never&quot; if I wanted to have children. I wanted to very badly, but a grad school stipend and the complete shitshow of dating in one&#39;s early 30s made it almost impossible, and based on those encounters I assumed I had a very low chance of getting pregnant anyway. </p>

<p>Either way, I was so absurdly excited and now it&#39;s all gone. I guess I&#39;ll try again, but I don&#39;t think I&#39;ll be able to enjoy one second of it because all I will be able to think about is another miscarriage. I&#39;m sure you understand! And I also feel a ton of guilt. I &quot;only&quot; had one miscarriage. Some people can never get pregnant.

This community here helped me get through. I don‚Äôt post as much as I‚Äôve read. But it‚Äôs a safe place. The other things that helped me survive was my oldest child, therapy and meds. 

While I didn‚Äôt loose my angel during birth and we ‚Äúknew‚Äù she probably wasn‚Äôt going to make it.  it doesn‚Äôt prepare you for the pain. We found out during a check up that her heart had stopped beating. If I‚Äôm honest I knew for a week or two that something was off. There was nothing that could have been done though. And it did probably happen over Xmas and I didn‚Äôt want to forever connect Christmas with her stillbirth. 

I‚Äôm so sorry you had to experience this. Hugs. 

If you feel you will spiral it‚Äôs ok to ask your doctors to give you meds. Make an appointment with a therapist right away. You don‚Äôt have to deal with this alone. Hug your oldest child. Mine was 18 months when we lost her sister. I am the stay at home parent. Having to get out of bed and do things to take care of her saved me. A good therapist is worth his/her weight in gold. I was on meds for a couple months but am able to deal with everything now. I still have bad days. It still hurts. But that dark hole will get lighter. 

Please don‚Äôt forget that there is no timeline for you ‚Äúto be done grieving‚Äù. It can take you days/weeks/Months/Years. No one should force you to feel better ‚Äúnow‚Äù.  

It is also ok to decline baby related invitations for a while. I couldn‚Äôt go to the playground for weeks. Seeing a little baby was triggering. 

Most people who haven‚Äôt experienced a loss will also not know how to respond/talk to you. Most will not want to hurt you, but they need your help telling them. I‚Äôve had to block friends who were pregnant on Facebook. I told them I‚Äôd rather talk via texts and calls and keep in touch that way and don‚Äôt want pregnancy updates. They were totally ok with that. 

There are things you‚Äôll have to decide for yourself. Do you want to talk about your daughter with friends? Let them know. Because they‚Äôll want to avoid upsetting you so they‚Äôll avoid the topic altogether. Because they don‚Äôt know you want to talk about it. They may also want to do something for you. I had friends wanting to help
But didn‚Äôt know how. We asked for meals. They organized themselves and brought us meals for 10 days. My point is: if you have an established support system now is the point where you need to tell them. You don‚Äôt have to do so in person with everyone. Ask your best friend for help. Make a post on Facebook. It sucks so much having to do anything for yourself now. So if you do anything for yourself now, make it telling people what you need.

If you've seen any of my posts in the last week or so you'll know I had a loss just over 3 weeks ago and have continued to bleed quite badly, past the point that my doctors in the UK would have expected. On 10th March I was given an ultrasound and told I had no retained tissue, but I suspect this isn't the case as bleeding continued.

The bleeding had stopped around 48 hours ago, but last night it came back with a vengeance. Within an hour I'd flooded through 4 pads and 3 sets of clean clothes and was having huge blood clots. I happened to get a call from my doctor after the 3rd pad and she recommended going straight to hospital. I jumped in the shower to rinse off, grabbed a couple of things (my panicked mind grabbed several pairs of socks and nothing else) and decided to drive myself. I live out in the country and didn't want to wait for an ambulance to arrive.

The entire drive (about 20 mins) I could feel blood and clots just pouring out of me. No pain whatsoever. I was admitted straight away to the hospital and then pretty much laid there for 5 hours in my own blood.

They took some blood and administered some fluids (but missed my veins 4 times because I'd lost so much). The doctor listened to my heart and breathing and poked my abdomen a little, but not once did anyone look at the bleeding or the clots which were still pouring out of me. Not once! I was discharged with nothing further. No ultrasound, no nothing. When I got up the nurse who'd been working on me seemed shocked by how much blood there was, but said there was nothing else they could do.

I drove home, took a shower, and got in bed with my partner who held me tight.

I tried to advocate for myself but it's hard as the language is foreign to me. They made a follow up appointment for Thursday in their gynaecology unit so unless the bleeding becomes worse again that will be my next stop. It seems to have slowed, but the last two nights it has become much worse in the evenings. I'm not sure if that's a coincidence or if it's significant?

There's some good news. Good news is no signs of infection so far (no fever, no pain, no bad smell) and my HCG went from 1600 on 10th March to 449 on 20th March, so the level is going down.

I feel so totally drained right now. I'm exhausted but too scared to sleep in case I start bleeding again. I want this to be over and to have answers. And more than anything I just want to be pregnant again.",[],,t1_dw1hv9p,False,0,[],False,"<div class=""md""><p>TW: graphic </p>

<p>I just can&#39;t imagine going through childbirth feeling like this. I thought I was physically much stronger. </p>

The early days and weeks are just awful. It's ok if you're not ready to think about trying again yet. It doesn't mean you'll feel the same way in a few weeks or even a few days.

Personally, I've found my feelings swing around a lot after loss. In November, we lost our son at 16 weeks, our seventh loss. I had a follow up appointment a couple weeks afterwards where my doctor told us we could try again whenever we felt ready and tried to talk about some tests she would recommend. I told her that it didn't matter because I was never going to get pregnant again. She gently said that it was worth talking about just in case and I told her that I really meant it and was never, ever going to have sex again. Yikes! A couple weeks later I was feeling ready to try again and we talked about it at the next appointment. We didn't even miss the first cycle.

Not saying this is how you'll feel - it's such a personal decision and there's no right or wrong answer. Just that my husband and I have always gone right back to trying and I would still not feel ready to think about it on day 3.

Also, it's not uncommon for the IV starts to be difficult and require a couple attempts if you have had a fair amount of fluid loss. I'm not trying to make excuses for the nurses, but try to make you feel like it's ""normal"" and not something to be concerned about. (Asides from the inconvenience and pain from having all those pokes).

I'm going to echo what's already been said - please don't refer to the worst thing that has happened to so many members of this group as ""horror stories."" It's the unfortunate reality for so many people here and I'm sure they aren't posting to make you feel worse. ""Horror story"" could be defined so many ways - is it having a full term stillbirth? having to terminate for medical reasons? multiple first trimester losses? multiple second trimester stillbirths? a single first trimester loss? All of these things, and more, have happened here. We are all here because we are living our own personal ""horror story,"" so I find it hurtful to label how you define horror as something that has actually happened to other people who also use this space as they push forward.

Stepping off my soap box, being here is kind of like opening Pandora's box. You know bad things can happen in pregnancy because something happened to you. Once you're here, you learn about all of the other ways the universe is shitty, and how there is no safe point in pregnancy. Did the late term loss stories scare me? Of course, but not more than any of the other ones. I think to be here you kind of have to accept that babies die and nothing can be taken for granted. Perhaps that's a pessimistic outlook, but it's my personal worldview after 3 consecutive miscarriages - something that only happens to ~1% of women.

TW: LC

I had 3 miscarriages before my pregnancy with my LC. To say I was anxious and paranoid the whole time would be an understatement. I made a commitment to myself to shoot for an 80/20 split where I let myself worry about the ""what ifs"" 20% of the time if I could keep it together the other 80. Knowing it was OK to worry some really helped me get to an OK-ish place in my pregnancy. I was very active in this sub for over a year before I got pregnant the 4th time, so I've seen lots of ups and downs. It's an amazing thing to see people you've gotten close to through shared experiences finally getting their take home babies. And you feel right there with the people you've gotten close to who lose another pregnancy. It's part of the experience being in this sub, imo. But the flip side is that people are right there with you for your highest highs and your lowest lows. When you're freaking out because there isn't as much movement as usual, other posters can draw on their own experience to coach you through what to say to the doctor (because really, you should *always* call your doctor when you're unsure what's going on!). I think the fact that we all have such different experiences of pregnancy loss is what makes this sub great because no matter what happens to you, you're never alone. We all push forward in life after pregnancy/baby loss together.",[],,t1_dvzz4wx,False,0,[],False,"<div class=""md""><p>I&#39;m sorry for your loss.</p>

Secondly, with respect, I'd probably suggest you not using the term ""horror stories"" to describe what the women in this forum post about with regards to late term losses.  I know you didn't mean it with malice, but it's a little derogatory imo.

In response to your question, I believe after loss, we will ALL have fear when it comes to having a healthy baby.  Women who don't have losses feel better after the viability scan or the ""viability date"" of 24 weeks.  But those of us who have had losses know that things can happen anytime and those arbitrary dates don't matter.  I don't think any stats or papers are going to alleviate your concerns.  The only thing we can do is take it one day at a time.

Stats are scary.  In the US, NIH says that stillbirth (pregnancy ending after 20 weeks) occurs in 1 out of 160 pregnancies.  Is that really something you want to think about?  Probably not.  Dopplers can help (though not recommended in late pregnancy), regular ob appointments help, staying healthy with diet and exercise helps...lots of things help, but not much can change something that is going to happen.

It is horrible to join the ""recurrent miscarriage"" club and I am so so sorry you're dealing with all the worry and sorrow that comes with it. 

Typically, after two or three first trimester losses or a single second or third trimester loss, doctors will start to run tests for recurrent loss. Depending on the details of your loss will help your doctor decide which tests are most urgent. Typically, doctors start with cheaper, less invasive tests for common issues. If you have more losses in the future (God forbid! I hope you don't!) they will recommend more invasive and expensive tests.

Many couples don't get any answers from recurrent loss testing - the maternal fetal medicine specialists my husband and I have seen have said this is true of about 50% of couples who suffer from recurrent loss. After two first trimester losses, there's still a very good chance that you are just the victim of terrible luck and that there's no underlying issues that place you at great risk of loss. For other couples, it seems likely that there is an underlying issue but perhaps not one medicine can diagnose yet.

The ""good"" news (is there any good news after the loss of a child!?) is that you are still very likely to have a healthy baby in the next pregnancy after two losses. I've had seven unexplained losses, including our most recent in the 2nd trimester, and unbelievably the doctors I've seen are still very hopeful that my husband and I will have a healthy baby, even without treatment. I know that I don't feel that hopeful and we're definitely trying things - heparin, baby aspirin, low dose naltrexone, progesterone, and a few other things. I'm sure you don't feel very hopeful either. It's ok to not feel hopeful right now while you're grieving. But statistically, there is every reason to think things will improve.

The body tries to get the hormones right for ovulation and you'll see good cervical mucus, positive OPKs, etc. But if the body doesn't get the hormones quite right, ovulation won't happen and the body backs down to try again later. So then you see another episode of all those fertility symptoms further down the line. 

To make it even more confusing, you're very likely to experience breakthrough bleeding in cycles like these. The ovulation attempts involve high estrogen, which builds up the lining of the uterus. Normally, the egg is released and the follicle that's left behind produces progesterone, which stabilizes the lining. But since ovulation has failed, that doesn't happen and there's no progesterone to stabilize the lining. This means that it sheds unpredictably. As if it couldn't get more confusing!

The best/cheapest way to figure this out is to track temperatures. Temperatures shift when progesterone goes up, which only happens after ovulation (since the left behind follicle is what produces it). This gives you a way to confirm that the ovulation attempt was successful. You could also try new progesterone detecting strips, though they're a bit pricey - you can get them on Amazon. Doctors will order blood tests for this as well, but that's not really an at-home solution.

I hope something in here helps. I am so sorry for the loss of your twins. It is so hard to grieve and figure out these physical issues at the same time.

These things are impossible to plan.  There are so many unknowns.  

I've seen friends have fewer maternity leave benefits if they started a new contract after they were pregnant (even though their employer didn't change).  I've also seen requirements for being employed for one year before starting maternity leave (i.e. one could get pregnant after a few months on the job).  But I haven't seen requirements that employee wait a year before even getting pregnant.  That's pretty demanding. 

I'm also thinking of switching jobs...in our case, it probably wouldn't affect of how *long* of a maternity leave I have, but rather whether or not the leave would be *paid* or not.  My husband and I have decided that unpaid maternity leave would essentially be like me being a stay-at-home mom for a few months....and that's something we can save for and accommodate financially.  For us, we'd rather do that if we need to, rather than putting off TTC until my job situation is sorted out.  It's not workable for everyone, but in some cases, it offers a compromise.

I'm sorry you're encountering a lack of sensitivity/support from all these different places.  

I'm also on a FB hiatus.  Like others have said, medication doesn't have to be the first resort for low mood.  Sometimes just having an outlet to talk about your experience is helpful.  If you're going to see someone, I'd recommend seeing if you can get a referral for someone who has experience with pregnancy/infant loss.  (That's who I see.)  In our area, there's also a parent support group for pregnancy and perinatal loss.  I'd never really seen a therapist or gone to a support group before, but I've found these things helpful.  And if just talking isn't enough, there's a things like CBT, too.

As for your husband, just as you may have insecurities about your body after your experiences with TTC, MC, and moving to IVF, he probably now feels the same after these SA results (if he didn't already).  After all ""not catastrophic"" isn't what anyone hopes for. He might also feel like as a man, he should be the problem solver, but when it comes to fertility, there's little he can control.  He may not want to talk about the possibility of IVF not working out yet, because everything is easier to shoulder if he can compartmentalize and focus on the possibility of success.  

It's hard to feel like you can't connect with your husband or communicate with him about some of these things.  All you can do is keep the lines of communication open.  You know your husband best--whether or not he's okay with talking about fears, insecurities, etc. in other contexts. He might be more open to a general ""what are your *thoughts* about these test results?"" than a ""how do you *feel* about your SA issues?"" or ""what if we can't have kids?"".  He might be better having these conversations in small doses, rather than one extended plow through everything.  

I really hope that your appointment at the fertility clinic will turn a corner for you guys, and that things will start looking up!  In the meantime, take care of yourself!

Some days it feels impossible to let go of the life you wanted so badly. I‚Äôve been struggling with that so much lately, too. 

The other day I was spiraling into despair and forced myself to go on a long walk (like a 3 hour slow walk). I forced myself to notice little details like a small cactus that was super tiny and cute. The small piece of wood that had wedged itself into the sidewalk.  The tiny bloom that was trying to open on the prickly pear plant. Forcing myself to notice small details around me pushed my sadness to the side for a bit and I realized no matter how sad I feel there are still beautiful things in my life.

<p>The other day I was spiraling into despair and forced myself to go on a long walk (like a 3 hour slow walk). I forced myself to notice little details like a small cactus that was super tiny and cute. The small piece of wood that had wedged itself into the sidewalk.  The tiny bloom that was trying to open on the prickly pear plant. Forcing myself to notice small details around me pushed my sadness to the side for a bit and I realized no matter how sad I feel there are still beautiful things in my life.

I have been there, in days like that, where the grief feels like a quicksand you can't pull yourself out of. The due date can hit so hard sometimes.  But I will say this - it won't always hurt this badly.  It will get easier, slowly.  Here are some of the things that helped me most, in moments like that:

 - Give yourself lots of self-compassion.  Acknowledge the part of yourself that is hurting, and don't fight against it.  It makes sense that this hurts.  Pregnancy loss is so so hard, and it takes time to emotionally heal.  Don't judge yourself for hurting or for struggling.  You are human.

 - Self-care, self-care, self-care: Do whatever brings you comfort and peace, and make time for it no matter what (even when you don't feel like it).  Taking walks, long baths, a favorite cup of tea or coffee, reading, cooking a favorite meal, binge-watching a funny TV show.  For me, meditation and yoga helped SO much.

 - When it's hard to get out of bed and get moving, find one little thing you feel up for doing and start there, even if it's just getting up to take a shower.  You're right that lying in bed thinking about it isn't helping. I always find that once I am moving, doing *something*, it's a lot easier to put one foot in front of the other.  Getting started is the hardest part.

 - Try to force yourself to go to the dinner party.  It may feel like you don't want to be there, but once you're there it may help.  Laughter and feeling connected to others are usually the things that help lift me out of the hole.  If these are close enough friends, you may even find that you can get some of this off your chest.

 - And finally, think about therapy as an option.  Pregnancy loss is so hard, and so isolating.  It's hard to talk to people who haven't been through it.

Is it possible to have properly ovulated 14 days after an early MC? 

‚Ä¢ Usually I ovulate late on CD18-30 so it‚Äôs a bit early even in a normal cycle. 
‚Ä¢ I got achiness in my womb for two days during the perceived ovulation. 
‚Ä¢ I got lots of CM.
‚Ä¢ My LH tests showed an almost positive on about CD12-14. Although that could still be settling from the MC. 
‚Ä¢ My temp has risen. Then again I‚Äôm using Ava so who knows ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è

I KNOW I know, stop shaking your head, I‚Äôm doing it too at myself. On CD10 I was still showing positive on pregnancy test and LH so I know i should be taking a goddamn break from it all until I‚Äôm back to normal. So of course, knowing this means I‚Äôve completely disregarded rational thought and ignored my own advice. It‚Äôs unlikely to be ovulation right? Or at least a ‚Äòproper‚Äô one. 

To add idiocy to injury, then.... get this..... I stupidly googled some stuff and LITERALLY 100% of women who had a miscarriage on this this particular  thread were pregnant within two weeks of their early MC and went on to have an actual baby. WOW. I was looking on fucking babycenter. So you know. High chance of accuracy there, from people who spell pregnancy ‚Äòprganecy‚Äô. 

Someone get a taser and get me under control. I am clutching at so many straws and I‚Äôm watching myself do it and know I‚Äôm getting hopeful, even though it‚Äôs ludicrous. What, I‚Äôm expecting to be pregnant 14 days after a MC and live happily ever after? 

But y‚Äôknow, I almost welcome this feeling. Because after two weeks of darkness it feels almost fun to care about temp checking, opks and symptoms again. The obsessing isn‚Äôt healthy but it feels better than desolation. I want to get back in the game. I‚Äôve not lost my hope yet. Sanity maybe, but not hope.

I had the same thing happen to me in January/February. I went in for my 8 week scan and the embryo measured less than 6 weeks.  They said maybe it's too early! Come back in two weeks. But during all that time I never developed many symptoms at all,  and I just had a gut feeling it wasn't right. At my follow up appointment, two weeks later the embryo only measured 6 weeks still.  No heartbeat detected. I had my hcg checked and the level was falling, indicating impending miscarriage. 

I had a little bit of a different mmc experience than I usually see here. I thought I wanted a d&c right away, but my office didn't offer it outright like most do. I asked about it,  but they suggested me to wait it out, and if it didn't start naturally in a week or two *then* they would intervene. I was nervous about doing that, but I came around and in the end, I actually think it was the best for me.  I ended up naturally miscarrying the 6week embryo at 12ish weeks. I started spotting on a Friday. Got some period like cramps through Saturday and then Sunday night things got intense for about 5 hours. It was extremely painful, but not completely unbearable while things passed. I was fine enough to make it to work Monday. I had a follow up ultrasound on that Thursday and they said I passed everything OK. No intervention needed. I bled like a period for about 10 days. The only thing I had to do was have my hcg levels checked (blood work) every 2 weeks until it goes down to zero (at least less than 5) 

My only downside to doing it naturally was that it sucked waiting for my body to kick in and do it's job. Walking around every day technically still pregnant, but not actually pregnant anymore was hard, as was not knowing when it would actually start to happen. It could have been any day of the week. But honestly, I managed it OK. I'm glad I didn't need a d&c, or the misoprostal.

I‚Äôve had 2 first trimester missed miscarriages. One discovered at 12 weeks, measured 8 weeks. This one I was already bleeding however it wasn‚Äôt really progressing on it‚Äôs own and I was desperate for it to be sorted. I had an uncomplicated D&C as doctors were fairly certain it would not resolve in its own.
My second miscarriage never progressed beyond around the 6 week mark. However I had no reduction in symptoms, no bleeding and no cramps. I ended up getting another D&C at what would have been 9 weeks, still had morning sickness until the procedure. This one was a harder recovery, I lost a fair bit of blood and developed a fever so took antibiotics.
Both times my cycle came back fairly quickly 4-6 weeks after. My periods were a little different the first two cycles but settled quickly.
I also had misoprostol right before these D&C‚Äôs and for a second trimester MMC. I hate the stuff and find it excruciating, so be prepared to ask for decent pain relief if you go this way. They say ibuprofen and paracetamol is enough but this is not the case for me! 
They gave me the option to wait for the process to happen naturally for the second miscarriage but I don‚Äôt trust my body to do so in a timely manner. Plus I feel like a ticking time bomb and find it really hard to function while waiting.

We had a mmc at 9 week. Baby stopped growing at 7w3d. 

Between the time I found out and when I saw the doctor for the misoprostol prescription I had started the bleed very very lightly. 

The misoprostol wasn't so bad as they gave me perkicet for the pain. And I also did not bleed much. I was told to expect heavier than a normal period and it ended up being lighter than my periods. I passed everything but had to push to do so. It left me feeling a little sore but fine. I worked from home through it all. 

For me, the worst part was a few days after I was done the misoprostol. I was getting migranes and felt flu-like which I was told was normal. I am better now but still get a migrane every few days. It's been about a month since I miscarried. I did have an ultrasound to confirm everything was gone.

When you go to the doctor they will likely give you 3 options. Go natural  (my ob discouraged this as infection is more likely), misoprostol  (low risk of infection but only 80% effective), or a d&c which is day surgery and risks scarring your uterus.

Why was my baby born 4 months ago?   

On top of that, my sister's due date was two days ago, so I've been expecting that birth announcement every day for the last week...but still no baby.  For the four months that I knew we were both expecting, and one week apart, I sometimes thought, ""Wouldn't it be crazy hers was born a couple days late, and mine was born a couple days early?  It would be like 'cousin twins'.""   And now hers *is* a couple days late.  But my son is dead.

<p>Men just go on with life, until they&#39;re told it&#39;s sexy time.  If that was my lot, I think it would be easier to &quot;just relax&quot; too.  :-P</p>

<p>Honestly, my husband has been terrific.  I consider myself lucky. But even he sometimes forgets that I&#39;m not yet where he is emotionally with respect to grieving our son.  And the TTC comes on top of that.</p>

It's not easy.  

All of the bereavement materials our hospital gave us talked about challenges for couples: how it's common for people to grieve differently and at different paces, and how this can cause tension if both partners aren't aware of this and accommodate each other.  I hope you can find access to similar information and read it with your partner.  It was certainly helpful for us.  As were bereavement chapters for fathers.  

Every loss comes with guilt.  People who don't experience a TFMR have guilt over things like why their body didn't carry the baby to term, or why they didn't go to the ER as soon as they noticed the baby wasn't moving as much, etc.  At the same time, the stigma associated with TFMR makes it isolating in a way that other types of losses are not.  

For me, it feels like the world has been divided into people who are ignorant of what it's like to receive a diagnosis and make a life-or-death decision for their child, and people who do know.  And even though it sometimes sounds hollow to me, it's still the case that the people who haven't been through something like this don't have the foundation of knowledge and experience which makes them qualified to pass judgement.
  
I've been surprised to find that in addition to other parents who've experienced TFMR, some parents who've been most understanding have been parents who lost their babies shortly after birth--after stays in the NICU and having to make a decision to end life support.  They know that none of us chose for our babies to be so ill.  They know what it is like to decide to end life support (which is essentially what TFMR is).  And in a way, they understand what our alternative was better than we do, because they saw what their children went through.  

I hope you can come to see that you deserve the same compassion and self-care as any other parent who has had to make a decision to end support for their ill child.

This is the third tri, right? Or does that start at 28 weeks? Either way, only 11 weeks until my scheduled csection. It feels both very short and interminably long.

I‚Äôm sitting in the lab waiting for my GD bloodwork‚Äî this is the first time I haven‚Äôt had to fast for the test AND it‚Äôs only one hour! Fasting is a cruel thing to make a pregnant woman do. My mouth tastes gross all the time, and after drinking that glucola or whatever it tastes like a garbage can. 

Yesterday I had a routine visit with my Endo to check my thyroid numbers,and I‚Äôm finding these visits really triggery. I LOVED her in my last pregnancy, but this time she just seems so determined to talk me into having a good time with this pregnancy and I just want her to order my bloodwork and not talk about my feelings. At this point I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs worth finding a new endocrinologist, but I do just wish she would stop asking probing questions about the pregnancy itself beyond what is relevant to her practice. Yesterday she was asking me about my most recent ultrasound and confirmed everything was great and the baby looked fine. And then she said, ‚ÄúI bet you‚Äôre about to tell me it looked fine in your last pregnancy too.‚Äù Of course it did. I really resented that she wanted to minimize my anxiety when having everything look good until week 39 in a previous pregnancy is not a good enough reason to not be confident in this pregnancy resulting in a live baby. She also asked me how my daughter (age 3) was feeling about the baby. I told her honestly that my daughter seems very excited about the new baby but that her most frequent question is, ‚Äúcan we bring that baby home?‚Äù I thought the Endo was going to tear up at that, and I kind of didn‚Äôt have any patience for it. I already KNOW it‚Äôs a heartbreaking thing for a three year old to say repeatedly, because it is a daily lived experience for me. Negotiating her questions and her fear alongside my own is one of those things that definitely gets shuffled over in the hubbub of the subsequent pregnancy because people assume a preschooler is too young to grasp the hell her family has been enduring for the past year, but she‚Äôs been living it too. I just kind of hate how my Endo is always so bubbly and excited about my pregnancy while being so reticent to acknowledge all the complicated and very real fears that have come along with it.

It sounds like you have a lot of information still coming in.  That information might provide some clarity for both you and your doctor.

Or it might suggest that what caused the loss of your son has a low chance of recurrence, and your next pregnancy is not necessarily high risk.  If MFM approves, you might be able to take that to your RE, and push for trying again earlier.  Alternatively, if the results suggest you'll need more intensive monitoring in a subsequent pregnancy, you might opt to wait until you're set up with a new team in your new home, to ensure the move doesn't disrupt your care.  
  
You can also ask her if she can provide you with the info for the studies upon which she's basing her recommendations (author, year, journal, title), so you can look at them yourself, if you'd like to.  If her recommendation is based on professional preference, rather than data that is relevant to your situation, that might also help your case for trying earlier.

You can probably find this in my post history, but I had a hysteroscopy after my third miscarriage in January.  After taking misoprostol for a missed miscarriage in December, repeated follow-up ultrasounds showed something in my uterus--my OB was pretty sure it was a polyp, but I wanted it out straight away.  So this was not just an exploratory hysteroscopy; she went in planning to surgically remove a mass in my uterus.  

I was told I could choose between general anesthesia and ""heavy sedation,"" and I chose the latter because of the quicker hospital recovery time (they told me general anesthesia would take 3-4 hours before I could go home, but with the sedation I could be ready an hour after the procedure).  I had had a prior D&C (years ago, different miscarriage) under heavy sedation and seriously did not remember anything so I was fine with it.

The procedure was short, I remember nothing after being rolled out of the pre-op room, and then I woke up in the recovery room about an hour (tops) later telling the nurse how hot my anesthesiologist was.  I was a little uncomfortable for the rest of the day but I went back to work the next day.  In retrospect, I was still a little out of it and should probably have taken that day off, but it was fine.  I received maybe two or three days' worth of oxycodone or percocet, but I didn't need to take it all, though I did take the Rx-level advil for the full three days.  

Pathology results indicated that the mass my OB extricated was actually retained products of conception, which was a surprise.  All the other pictures show a perfectly normal uterus, and my RE did a saline sonogram a few weeks after the hysteroscopy and confirmed no scar tissue/adhesions.  

I'm also on synthroid for hypothyroidism (and have been for years), but all my other tests are normal save for a ""low-normal"" AMH.

As others have mentioned, it would be a good idea to have a follow-up with your doctor, just for your own health.  This is the ""trying to conceive"" subreddit, but you mentioned planning to wait until graduation to get married and start a family.  If you are concerned about future unintended pregnancies before you and your boyfriend are ready, you can also review your birth control options with your gynecologist, as well as how to use them.  The third thing your doctor may be able to do is provide a letter for your professors, if you need to request a deferral of assignments or exams.  

Regarding your boyfriend, everyone deals with a loss differently, and at different speeds.  It can be a big challenge for a lot of couples to try to support their partners, when they are grieving in different ways, or when one is feeling better sooner than the other.    Just keep trying to talk about where you are each at, and try to give each other space/support to do what you both need to do.  

It's also possible, because your pregnancy was unplanned, that your boyfriend had some feelings of fear when you guys first learned of the pregnancy.  He may now not just feel bad about the loss, but also feel guilty about his previous fears.  (You may be too.)

Many women find it helpful to see a counselor or therapist while they work through their grief.  Many college campuses offer mental health/counseling services that are free or low-cost.  Do a Google search, or contact your university health services, to see what is available at your campus.  When making an appointment, you can ask if any of their therapists have experience counseling about miscarriage or pregnancy loss.  

Alternatively, you might also ask your gynecologist or OB if they know of counseling or therapists who specialize in pregnancy loss.  However, this may not be covered by insurance, or to get coverage, you might need your parent's help to get the visits authorized (if your insurance is through them).   It might be tricky navigating this conversation with your parents, while maintaining your privacy.  (Saying, ""I'd like to see a therapist, and my Dr. has referred me to see X person.""

FWIW, in the States, unless you seek a private midwife for a planned home birth, most midwife practices are backed up by an OB office or by the OB hospitalists where they have admitting privileges. I‚Äôve seen two midwife practices on opposite coasts and both were set up more or less like this‚Äî if your risk is heightened in any way, they have MDs to back up their care/take over your case. For this current pregnancy, I‚Äôm seeing a midwife despite having a scheduled csection planned for 38 weeks, and my midwives are totally supportive of that. They obviously won‚Äôt be able to perform the surgery, but one will be in the room with me at delivery and they‚Äôll be the ones checking on me for the duration of my hospital stay. This was the same with my birth on the west coast‚Äî I wound up w/ a CSection and while there was not a midwife present in the OR (it was a teaching hospital so the OR was pretty crowded with residents) the midwives on call were the ones to check on me/my stitches/my healing a couple times a day and the next one showed up with each shift change. I also went there for my follow up care. They definitely treat a natural vaginal birth as the optimal outcome but I have never felt like a midwife wasn‚Äôt doing what she felt was absolutely best for mine and my baby‚Äôs health or honoring my choices (where medically applicable). I like the care of a midwife because they seem so much more invested in a holistic approach to prenatal care‚Äî how you‚Äôre feeling mentally, etc. This is especially important to me after my stillbirth. My midwife‚Äôs steady, soothing presence got me through that day. The birth is one day but the pregnancy is nine months, and especially in this case I felt midwife care was the best way to negotiate enduring this pregnancy, even though I won‚Äôt have spent months building up a trusting relationship with the doctor who is eventually assigned to slice this baby out of me‚Äî it‚Äôs enough for me that my midwife will implicitly trust that person.
