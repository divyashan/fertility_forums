I have a similar story, so maybe this will help with some clarity/steps to move forward and feel more in control. 

I got pregnant in April from the first attempt and lost the baby at 6w3d. I didn't find out, however, until 10w and I miscarried the next day on the 19th of June.

My hcg levels were 5100 on Tues, mc on weds, 900 on Thurs, and 59 the following Tuesday. They dropped drastically, but I only got a negative test this morning for the first time (almost two weeks after mc).

Everyone is different, of course. But I've read that you ovulate when you hcg gets low enough, but I've also read people have ovulated with positive levels, too. It is confusing.

Anyway, this is what I'm doing to take back some control. I've downloaded a couple apps (Fertility Friend for basal temperature tracking and Premom for ovulation test scans). I take my temp every morning before I get up, pee on some ovulation tests I purchased from Amazon (which I don't think I did right because I think I just ovulated but never got a 'peak'), and track my symptoms and moods. This makes me feel like I'm taking a step forward and gaining some control. I'm also learning about my body (which is pretty interesting) to prepare for getting pregnant again.

I'm trying to stay rational and remind myself that it probably won't happen quickly, but this tracking will give me a bit more luck.

It felt like the only thing I wanted was (1) my baby and (2) if not my first baby, a second baby. I was told very early on by my family doctor to wait 6 months. My OB was noncommittal and said timeline might change based on blood tests - ones I couldn‚Äôt take until 10 weeks after. Which was the week of my due date. Great. So it felt super shitty - waiting to feel better to exercise, to lose baby weight, to take blood tests, tovget past Mother‚Äôs Day, due date, Father‚Äôs Day. I thought I was waiting until Oct to try. I was jealous of someone who had a similarly timed loss/gestation who was trying again. Honestly it SUCKS. You‚Äôre only a month out - I‚Äôm only 3 months out - I have to imagine that, on a baseline level, things will get sort of better?

It felt like the only thing I wanted was (1) my baby and (2) if not my first baby, a second baby. I was told very early on by my family doctor to wait 6 months. My OB was noncommittal and said timeline might change based on blood tests - ones I couldn‚Äôt take until 10 weeks after. Which was the week of my due date. Great. So it felt super shitty - waiting to feel better to exercise, to lose baby weight, to take blood tests, tovget past Mother‚Äôs Day, due date, Father‚Äôs Day. I thought I was waiting until Oct to try. I was jealous of someone who had a similarly timed loss/gestation who was trying again. Honestly it SUCKS. You‚Äôre only a month out - I‚Äôm only 3 months out - I have to imagine that, on a baseline level, things will get sort of better? </p>

Backstory: my childhood friend and I have been pretty close throughout our lives. She‚Äôs a nurse at a fertility clinic. When we first started fertility treatment, we didn‚Äôt tell anyone. I was naively hoping to get pregnant quickly and then tell people about it (lol). Eventually, a few months in and really struggling with the process, I confided in her. She was amazing about it and was always willing to answer any questions I had. She was a lifesaver. 

Then in January she told me she was ten weeks pregnant. She literally apologized to me and said we never had to talk about it. Of course I wanted to be supportive and happy for her, and to her face I was, but honestly at home I felt pretty devastated. 

The devastation didn‚Äôt last long because a week later I found out I was finally pregnant. I told her at eight weeks and from that moment on we were always talking about our pregnancies. Once again, being eight weeks ahead of me, she was a really helpful resource on comparing experiences and such. 

Now of course I‚Äôm devastated again. She‚Äôs been very supportive, periodically texting me just to say she‚Äôs thinking of me. But I‚Äôm just dreading her having her baby. I simply can‚Äôt imagine holding a newborn baby and not having an utter meltdown. I‚Äôve thought about skipping the hospital part and seeing them at her home because that feels slightly more tolerable, but every time I imagine holding him I just lose it. 

She‚Äôs a great friend and I don‚Äôt want to not visit her and her baby. But I have no idea how to deal. I mean, it‚Äôs still a month away (she has a scheduled c-section so the date is pretty much set), but I can‚Äôt imagine being so far in the grieving process that I‚Äôm totally okay with it.

<p>You are not alone (unfortunately?  Fortunately?) , but that also means there‚Äôs people who get it and if you need to withdraw and heal, I‚Äôm here to tell you it‚Äôs ok.</p>

We spent a lot of time talking about Skylar (and I feel like I spend all my time thinking about her), mostly making us sad but sometimes trying to appreciate that we had her at all. But other times we were pretty immersed in the things we were doing and seeing. Though sometimes when that happens I feel guilty about it. Overall the change of scenery was a good break I think, though coming home and back to this reality was a bit crushing. 

As you can see, I‚Äôm a bit all over the place. 

I‚Äôm still bleeding three weeks and four days later. I‚Äôm frustrated because the OB who did my D&E said average bleeding time was two weeks so I got my hopes up it would be done by now. Also I‚Äôve repeatedly stopped bleeding for hours, once even a full 24 hours, only to start bleeding again, which is so frustrating every time. 

In very good news, I spoke to our genetic counselor yesterday and our blood work (karyotyping?) all came back normal. What Skylar had was a fluke and my other fear, that we‚Äôd find some other issue, was not realized. 

I also signed up for weight watchers yesterday. I started off a relatively normal weight before pregnancy (BMI of 23) but managed to gain 25 lbs in my 23 weeks of pregnancy. Skylar always measured ahead and I come from a family of big babies, so while I found this upsetting, it wasn‚Äôt surprising. I‚Äôm pretty sure I was days away from failing my glucose test. Very fortunately, the first 15 pounds seem to disappear in the first week. We did a lot of walking (that‚Äôs kind of how we process things), but weren‚Äôt particularly careful about what we ate. So I guess that‚Äôs one good thing my body did.

My husband  just went back to work for the first time. This will be the longest we‚Äôve been apart so far. Thinking of heading down to my mom‚Äôs to have company for the day. But wondering if I need to just suck it up and be alone.

She‚Äôs due a few weeks after we were so I basically don‚Äôt want to see her until after we are pregnant again. But we have a mutual friend visiting next weekend so I will have to. I don‚Äôt know how I am supposed to look at her and not feel like her baby bump should be on me too.</p>

Years after the stillbirth, anything baby related was still bittersweet. My wife actually ‚Äúrecovered‚Äù  sooner than I did. We tried to retreat from the world to lick our wounds and heal. We got the usual ‚Äúat least it happened before you got to know them‚Äù comments that infuriated me. What people don‚Äôt realize is that‚Äôs one of the hurts... never getting to meet them. That and the lifetime of ‚Äúwhat if‚Äùs.

That said, I know you are hurting, but try to not get angry, especially at friends. Most haven‚Äôt been through this and won‚Äôt know how to act. They probably don‚Äôt want to hurt you. But one thing I have learned is that no matter how much pain and sorrow we are going through, we can‚Äôt expect the world to stop. And we can‚Äôt expect our friends and family to put their lives and happiness on mute to spare  our feelings. They have every right to celebrate their own happiness and miracle babies. We shouldn‚Äôt hold that against them, either.

My best advice would be to keep some distance for a while. Maybe even tell your friends/family upfront that you are happy FOR them, but need time to grieve and make peace with your own pain before you can go back to normal and be happy WITH them. Good friends will understand this and wait. Just don‚Äôt cut all ties. You never know what you might be giving up. At least as long as they are understanding and not rubbing it in your face. If they are toxic, drop them.

That, and find someone to talk to. Family, husband, other friends, or even new friends here that you can talk to. Not talking helps no one. I didn‚Äôt talk to anyone after the stillbirth. My pain and misery were too much to hold inside, so I started pointing it outwards. Saw other people‚Äôs happiness and pregnancies as ‚Äúinconsiderate‚Äù and ‚Äúrude‚Äù towards me. I was angry at the world because I did not know how to grieve. And it took me almost 4 years to move past it. I wouldn‚Äôt wish that on anyone.

We had our most recent mc a few weeks ago and are now getting ready for another embryo transfer at the end of July. One of our friends just gave birth 3 months ago. Another is 5 months pregnant. And another is 8 months or so. They all made their announcements while were were in various stages of IVF. I can honestly say I am truly happy for all of them and hold no anger or resentment or jealousy towards any of them.

Also, as a husband, I‚Äôd suggest talking to your DH before anyone. I promise you he is in just as much pain as you are, from what happened, from seeing you in pain over it, and from being powerless to protect you. He may put up a front and stay strong for you, but don‚Äôt assume he doesn‚Äôt understand or feel the same. You‚Äôd be surprised. Even if you just vent to him for a while, eventually he will talk back also.

Maybe even tell your friends/family upfront that you are happy FOR them, but need time to grieve and make peace with your own pain before you can go back to normal and be happy WITH them. Good friends will understand this and wait. Just don‚Äôt cut all ties. You never know what you might be giving up. At least as long as they are understanding and not rubbing it in your face. If they are toxic, drop them.</p>

<p>That, and find someone to talk to. Family, husband, other friends, or even new friends here that you can talk to. Not talking helps no one. I didn‚Äôt talk to anyone after the stillbirth. My pain and misery were too much to hold inside, so I started pointing it outwards. Saw other people‚Äôs happiness and pregnancies as ‚Äúinconsiderate‚Äù and ‚Äúrude‚Äù towards me. I was angry at the world because I did not know how to grieve. And it took me almost 4 years to move past it. I wouldn‚Äôt wish that on anyone.</p>

<p>We had our most recent mc a few weeks ago and are now getting ready for another embryo transfer at the end of July. One of our friends just gave birth 3 months ago. Another is 5 months pregnant. And another is 8 months or so. They all made their announcements while were were in various stages of IVF. I can honestly say I am truly happy for all of them and hold no anger or resentment or jealousy towards any of them.</p>

<p>Also, as a husband, I‚Äôd suggest talking to your DH before anyone. I promise you he is in just as much pain as you are, from what happened, from seeing you in pain over it, and from being powerless to protect you. He may put up a front and stay strong for you, but don‚Äôt assume he doesn‚Äôt understand or feel the same. You‚Äôd be surprised. Even if you just vent to him for a while, eventually he will talk back also. This will help you cope with your loss.</p>

I'm also 33, i had two losses in 2017,  one was ectopic and I lost a tube. Then in November last year I had surgery to remove an endometrioma and check on my remaining tube which looked like it was blocked,  it was so they also removed that. 



 Since the operation my cycles haven't been regular,  I had a number of really short ones (12-15 days) and some really long ones (40 days +) before the operation I was regular at 26 days. 



As I have no tubes, i was referred to have ivf under the NHS in the UK. They have criteria for funding so the clinic did a AMH test,  my result of 4 pmol/l was below what was needed for funding.  



With these results our consultant warned us about DOR and how we may not get much success using my own eggs as we may not get very many.  All scans showed that my left ovary (which had the endometrioma in) was smaller. And that varying cycle lengths are a sign of early menopause. I went into a very dark place and started doing a lot of research.  



I found that as long as you have regular ovulation the amh levels has little or no relevance to the chances of getting pregnant, also age is a critical factor,  as the quality of the remaining eggs will be better than some one who was 10 years older with similar amh levels. Also clinics use the numbers to aid the type and amount of stimulation drugs for ivf. 



They retested about 1 month later and my number rose to 5.1 pmol/l. I did nothing different between those tests.  With that result I gave two blood samples which both came back with different amh levels.  I personally think that there is a lot of error rate in the test for it to have so much importance when determining someone's reproductive future. Luckily my FSH was normal and my consultant agreed so they referred me for funding. 



I am due to start ivf when CD1 happens,  currently on CD31 and getting fed up of having pms. 



There are several ivf clinics that will treat someone with low amh  using several natural or mild ivf cycles to get 1 to 2 eggs per cycle therefore quality over quantity.  I looked into it but we decided not to go down that route at the moment.

With that result I gave two blood samples which both came back with different amh levels.  I personally think that there is a lot of error rate in the test for it to have so much importance when determining someone&#39;s reproductive future. Luckily my FSH was normal and my consultant agreed so they referred me for funding. </p>

<p>I am due to start ivf when CD1 happens,  currently on CD31 and getting fed up of having pms. </p>

<p>There are several ivf clinics that will treat someone with low amh  using several natural or mild ivf cycles to get 1 to 2 eggs per cycle therefore quality over quantity.  I looked into it but we decided not to go down that route at the moment. </p>

<p>Feel free to PM me if you want to chat/vent or just talk about how shitty the world is.  I would recommend seeing if you can get a retest for you AMH level along with CD1-3 FSH.</p>

I am sorry OP, it is a terrible thing to go through. 

I have living children and you are right, I don‚Äôt get it. Once I did get it, back when I lost my first baby, but that seems like a lifetime ago in some ways (and like yesterday in others)

I am sorry for your pain, I can remember how acute it was when I felt it, the lost motherhood, the fears that I would never have a living child, that I couldn‚Äôt get pregnant again

But the intensity of that pain is gone, and I can only feel warmth toward you and what you are going through, remembering that I once felt something similar, but not being able to completely stir up those feelings myself. 

I won‚Äôt say I get it, because you are right that I don‚Äôt. My life really did change completely once I held that sweet baby in my arms (my firstborn but not my first child) and while the sadness of my losses is still there, the fullness that I have from my living children does soften the blow somewhat as I lose more. Not that it isn‚Äôt terribly painful to be going through it again and again. But, at the same time, I know that I am not in that same desperate place I once was, and I will be honest that I don‚Äôt like to revisit that time in my life.

I wonder if this is what the women mean when they say they get it. Not that ‚ÄúI know how it feels‚Äù per se, but especially when they lost their first or also struggled with infertility, what they are really saying is, ‚ÄúI remember the pain, even distantly, and I am sorry‚Äù 

I will echo the ladies that losing a baby in between living children is terrible, but from the other side, it is easier than not having any. Yet recurrent miscarriage is still awful in so many ways, and I wouldn‚Äôt wish it on anyone. If I get pregnant again, the chance of baby making it is a toss up, unlikely. It‚Äôs a terrible limbo even if you have living children, but the blessing of the living children grounds me, and forces me to pull myself together in ways that I am grateful for; in other ways it adds new fears and complexities because sometimes I feel undeserving of another child due to the depression after a loss and being unable to give them what they need. I guess I am rambling on to say that yes, you are right, I cannot get it truly, because I am not there anymore. It‚Äôs only a memory. 

But for the ladies trying to help, a person can only truly see through their current life circumstances (and how the past has shaped them), and what was unbearable in different circumstances can unbearable in new ways for different reasons.

Here is it simplified: lots of appointments before cycle to get tests / blood work / see what they recommend. 

If IVF, then you start injections to mature eggs. After about a week and half to two weeks of this, you undergo egg retrieval which involves anesthesia and a fairly quick procedure. If you do a fresh cycle you will implant back in a couple of days later. This is very simple. No biggie. 

But if you decide to get genetic testing (which we are cause no obvious reason for our miscarriages and we want to rule out chromosomal issues before transferring) this takes a couple of weeks. Meanwhile embryos are frozen. You then have to keep them frozen until your body is ready for a transfer - so likely a whole cycle wait. 

Our doc will only transfer one embryo back at a time which is preferable for us. If it doesn‚Äôt take we could transfer another without stimulating again IF we have that many healthy embryos.

Wondering why this keeps happening? What's wrong with me? 

Now that I am on the other side, I can more fully appreciate HER feelings as well. At the end of the day, miscarriage, infertility, and baby loss has no winners. We are all suffering. 

I can also say that even though my daughter is the light of my life, I still think about the three that I lost probably close to every single day. I remember their due dates and the day we lost them. I have a special picture hanging in my daughter's room of three baby chicks. No one - not even my husband - knows that I selected that picture to represent the three that we lost, so that they could always be looking out for our daughter.

I was sad for 2-3 weeks.  Now I'm plain irritated and mad at the world, at my body for not getting pregnant easily, then not keeping it, and now not miscarrying the usual way for such an early pregnancy.  My poor DH, I am so irritated most of the time that he'll say something, make a facial expression, and I'm like ""oh what does that face mean, huh?!"" and he's like, uhhh it didn't mean anything.  And the rational piece of my brain knows he's right.  He's taken on the vast majority of household work the last 7 weeks, and occasionally will very nicely ask me if I can help with something.  About 50% of the time I overreact as if it's suuuch a burden.  Because right now, everything is irritating. I'm mad about everything.  I figure I'm moving weirdly through the states of grief/frustration.  My hcg is still not at 0, so it could also be hormones influencing things.

I had a CP end at 4.5 weeks after my corpus luteum f-ing burst.  It was painful, the doctor was terrible, I went to the ER to screen for an EP, and now 6 weeks later I STILL have spotting and did I just have a period? Or end of MC-bleeding?  Who the hell knows.  I was sad for 2-3 weeks.  Now I&#39;m plain irritated and mad at the world, at my body for not getting pregnant easily, then not keeping it, and now not miscarrying the usual way for such an early pregnancy.  My poor DH, I am so irritated most of the time that he&#39;ll say something, make a facial expression, and I&#39;m like &quot;oh what does that face mean, huh?!&quot; and he&#39;s like, uhhh it didn&#39;t mean anything.  And the rational piece of my brain knows he&#39;s right.  He&#39;s taken on the vast majority of household work the last 7 weeks, and occasionally will very nicely ask me if I can help with something.  About 50% of the time I overreact as if it&#39;s suuuch a burden.  Because right now, everything is irritating. I&#39;m mad about everything.  I figure I&#39;m moving weirdly through the states of grief/frustration.  My hcg is still not at 0, so it could also be hormones influencing things.  Also, before this I was irritated that I was going to be peeing on a lot of sticks with irregular cycles and having a lot of planned sex that may not even be at ovulation, and now I&#39;m irritated more that I have to do it all over again.

<p>My specialist I started seeing in March said every doctor should do an ultrasound assisted d&amp;c and sadly that isn‚Äôt the standard today. He said Stevie Wonder could do just as good a job as a medical doctor doing one because you literally don‚Äôt see anything unless it‚Äôs ultra sound assisted. This makes me so damn livid.</p>

<p>Scarring in the uterus is called ashermans syndrome. There‚Äôs a helpful group on Facebook if you haven‚Äôt joined yet.</p>

But I NEED another baby. My daughter won't stop talking about her brother even after I have told her several times he is dead, he was sick. She would be an amazing big sister. Our family is incomplete. This is something we have wanted so badly. 

I feel like the joy of being my daughters mom was taken away when she was a newborn due to severe postpartum anxiety and depression and I was so excited to be able to enjoy a baby at that stage.

Bleeding was minimal but went on for some time- I think almost 3 weeks, with the last week being spotting. My HCG levels baselined after that third week. I‚Äôve been very open about my miscarriage and it‚Äôs amazing just how many women have been where we are. It sucks, but knowing I‚Äôm not alone has really helped me. I hope my story helps you.</p>
