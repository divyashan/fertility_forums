I‚Äôm a big believer is honesty and sharing true emotions in a home, but of course keeping things age appropriate. We had a loss at 13 weeks so she was just barely aware. She would pat my tummy and say ‚Äúthere‚Äôs a baby in there‚Äù and ‚ÄúI want a brudder like Baba‚Äù (on her favorite show) so she knew something but not any real concept of how this was all going to work.

She knew I was sad last week when we found out the heartbeat had stopped. One morning I was playing with her and we read a lovely book about babies together (Little You, beautiful but do not recommend if you are going through a loss). I started to cry and decided not to hide it as it was gentle tears, not getting too upset in a way that would scare her. 

She asked me ‚Äúwhat you doing?‚Äù and was curious so I told her very gently. ‚ÄúMommy feels sad. Do you remember how there was a baby in my belly? Who was going to be your sister or brother? Well, that baby had to go away. It was not healthy, sweetheart. We still love it but it won‚Äôt be coming to live with us anymore. So mommy is sad because she will miss the baby a little bit. But that‚Äôs okay, we know it‚Äôs okay to be sad sometimes right? It feels good sometimes to feel our feelings and talk about it. And I want you to know that even though I feel sad sometimes, I ALWAYS still feel happy to be your mommy at the same time. And I love you and always love you, and will always be your mommy, no matter if I‚Äôm sick or feeling sad or am on a trip (my business trips haunt her haha).‚Äù

She listened quietly on my lap facing me and kinda looking down, thinking. And then she looked up at me and said ‚ÄúI can jump on you now??‚Äù Meaning, she had known for the past few weeks that her usual jumping and rough play with mommy had to be toned down. I couldn‚Äôt help but laugh - toddlers are blessedly direct and relate things to their needs oh so well. But hey, her response showed she was listening!

Yesterday was the D&E. She came home from daycare and found me in bed and knew enough to know it‚Äôs unusual. She crawled in with me and asked me why I was sick. I gently reminded her of our previous conversation and told her the doctors helped me say goodbye to the baby today and gave me some medicine to help me. And that I was sad again but not very sick and would be able to play with her again very soon. She just listened and then said ‚ÄúI can cuddle with you mommy!‚Äù and laid with me a bit. And then of course was up and about, back to her toddler antics. Which I wouldn‚Äôt have any other way.

So that‚Äôs how I handled a semi-early but still ‚Äúeveryone knew‚Äù loss with a young child. Not perfect I‚Äôm sure but somewhere between the truth and honesty in a way that felt right for our family. I think it‚Äôs okay to share your emotions in a way that feels appropriate - they don‚Äôt always have to see us being perfect and the goal at the end of the day is to build an honest two-way relationship. 

We are not religious and that makes it a bit more difficult to answer about where the baby went if asked, but we just stick with ‚Äúwent away‚Äù for now since she isn‚Äôt old enough to talk about death yet.

It would take a few hours to pore over the data and do this research myself. I did look at the research earlier this year so am going off memory and what you have cited, so the interpretation is like this:

-If 1 in 4 pregnancies ends in miscarriage, that means any given pregnancy that anyone has will ‚Äúpass go‚Äù 75% of the time. 

-Having only 1 mc does not mean you are at increased risk of multiple future mcs. This means your chance of a 2nd mc is about 25%.

-Having 2 or more mc‚Äôs, however, DOES mean you are at increased risk of more future mc‚Äôs. It could just be bad luck twice in a row, but it suggests there could be something else causing the problem - maybe. So if you have had 2 or more, your risk of a 3rd might be say, 35%. And if you‚Äôve had 4 mc‚Äôs, there might be a 45% chance of losing the 5th. These are made up numbers for the sake of example. 

-Yes, a forum like this is a non-random collection of women who fall into the unlucky 1% category. There are so many hard stories, rare misfortunes in one place that it‚Äôs hard to believe this is actually so rare. People who have had it the worst might respond the most often, which gives the appearance that bad outcomes are common.

Being a statistician, I have been stunned at how I‚Äôve been on the bad side of multiple different very rare statistics so many times this year, like WTF. I‚Äôm like, what are the chances? And then I bite my tongue when it happens to me. We ended up with this weird, random, unlikely chromosomal glitch that wasn‚Äôt inherited and has only been documented in a handful of times in the all of the medical research. Like a one in ten million thing. And this was after having a 7-week mc in the previous pregnancy, which isn‚Äôt super rare, especially at my older age. 

Of course this is also because we focus on the bad shit that happened to us that was unlikely. I had an amniocentesis, which has a 1:1000 chance of causing a miscarriage. It did not cause any problems. I had a 1:40 chance of having a Downs Syndrome baby at my age - pretty high. And I tested negative for that. Pregnancy feels like a video game where all these forces are trying to shoot you down. You can win a lot of those battles but just lose one and game over. 

Don‚Äôt try too hard to put all the numbers together into a single picture. They come from different studies with different caveats so the math doesn‚Äôt work out that way.

The ones that are most scientifically credible are tedious to read, hard even for doctors to understand (I teach doctors how to correctly interpret research), and not accessible to the general public. 

There are of course exceptions in each category, but generally speaking, online information about pregnancy ranked from least to most credible - 

-Least credible: Blogs, especially by someone who had a uniquely bad experience that isn‚Äôt representative of what 99% of people will face. There is no independent editorial oversight and often very biased views by people who have a bone to pick, and who cherry pick information that supports what they want to prove (confirmation bias). 

It‚Äôs also only one person‚Äôs opinion. Also in this category of very low credibility are Dr Oz (colleagues have lobbied to have his license revoked, because he‚Äôs such a sellout quack) and Gwyneth Paltrow/Goop. 

-Polls/surveys on Reddit. Asking fellow people about their experiences is all well and good. But please don‚Äôt try to use the responses to draw conclusions about how common a situation is, or how likely treatment X will cause outcome Y - that‚Äôs better off answered by a research study. The set of responses you get is representative of the 10 or 30 or so Reddit users who saw and responded to the question, whereas there‚Äôs most likely a study out there that included a much broader group of people (many thousands) and took extra steps to make sure responses weren‚Äôt biased. People who respond in online forums tend to have more extreme experiences that they want to share, but could just be the unlucky few; people with unremarkable pregnancies (lucky ducks) aren‚Äôt spending much time reading these posts. It‚Äôs good for personal stories, bad for statistics. 

-Magazines and online sites/apps like Fit Pregnancy, What to Expect, The Bump, These are a mixed bag. There is some consultation with medical experts and some level of editorial oversight and accountability for truth in reporting, but standards are very low. More clicks, more money. They are the easiest to read, so I use these resources too, but draw my own conclusions about whether they seem right or wrong.

-Individual published studies that you can find through Google, Google Scholar, PubMed. These are a mixed bag too. Some studies are well done, many are not. You can often find some study out there that supports your belief. What is harder to tell, unless you have a research background, is whether that study is any good. There might be 10 others that contradict it. You have to spend a ton of time looking at all the relevant studies (not just the first few you found that look relevant) in order to draw a good conclusion. 

-Reasonably credible - Sites with consistent medical and editorial quality standards that might be geared more towards health professionals, and that aren‚Äôt as click-driven. Healthline is not bad. Health systems like Mayo produce consumer-friendly material that is kept updated and reviewed by physicians for quality. 

-Most credible (hardest to read) - Professional medical associations like ACOG in the US. CDC, WHO. Reviews by the Cochrane Collaboration, which analyzes all the relevant studies on a topic. Beware of any group that has a quasi-official sounding name but isn‚Äôt clear on who is funding it or where the advice comes from. Some of these are fronts for a special interest group. American Pregnancy Association is one that I‚Äôm not totally confident is a legitimate group, though most of their content seems reasonable. The content by professional and research or policy groups is not easy to read or find by consumers. So for most people, I‚Äôd defer to the previous set of resources. 

TLDR - Use Reddit to learn about others‚Äô selective personal experiences, but don‚Äôt draw conclusions about what is true for ‚Äúmost.‚Äù Don‚Äôt draw any conclusions based on a single study. Use pregnancy magazines/sites/apps for light reading but take any medical advice with a grain of salt.

Have someone with you for support. I couldn't imagine doing this alone. My husband and I both took the day off.

A heating pad. This was a huge help to me. We didn't have one prior, my husband picked bought me one the same morning because of someone's suggestion. I was very thankful to have it.

Last Friday, I took my first round of miso (200mg x 4) orally. I had been given hydrocodone for pain. Though it was uncomfortable, I did not experience any bleeding beyond spotting. 

I reached out to my doctor on Monday, but she suggested I take it vaginally this time with a little dab of water on each pill before bedtime. 

The next evening, Tuesday, I took some pain medicine 30 minutes before starting the process. I had my husband help me insert the miso pills (still 200mg x 4) as I laid down so we could get them as far back as possible. I did not get up again... just slid backwards in bed. I set a timer for 2 hours to make sure I did not get up at all for the first few hours. 

About 4 hours in, I woke up in a lot of discomfort  and took another pain pill. I started bleeding when I went to the restroom like a heavy period. Taking the medicine before bedtime meant that I was asleep before and after this, so I imagine between the pain pills, my fatigue, and my blessed heating pad... I didn‚Äôt feel most of the discomfort. 

About 4 hours later, I began my heaviest bleeding and passing clots. The clots were not uncomfortable because they mostly just slipped out on their own. 

My heaviest bleeding was in the first 8-12 hours, but 24 hours overall. Most of the clots passed in this time period. 

It has now been a little over 48 hours since my medicine took effect and I‚Äôm still experiencing bleeding, but it‚Äôs mostly like a moderate-heavy stage of a regular period. I would be able to ‚Äúenjoy‚Äù this more if I was able to insert a tampon (I read online that it‚Äôs not recommended). I tried to take a walk yesterday (~36 hours after medicine) and my body began cramping and gushed more blood than if I had stayed being leisurely at home.

Early next week, I will follow up with my doctor and she should do another ultrasound to be certain that my pregnancy has been fully expelled. 

It‚Äôs ironic that another user first tried vaginally and then did orally the second time to better results, which is the opposite experience to mine. Based off of my current experience, I suggest: getting at least two doses of medicine, asking about some pain medication, taking it at night, having some long/thick pads to use, laying around at home a lot in the 48+ hours after taking it, and using a heating pad frequently.

I found out at my 11 week scan that baby had passed at 10 weeks. I decided to wait for my body to figure it out since I hate hospitals! 5 weeks later, I had tried acupunture, drinking copious amounts of red raspberry leaf tea and even jumping on a trampoline. My body other than releasing some of my mucus plug, didn‚Äôt figure it out.

I used 4x misoprostol vaginally at the highest dose. Within 40 minutes I started cramping but no blood.  20 minutes after that my waters burst (was NOT expecting that!). Then the bleeding started. Within 6 hours I had delivered baby and placenta together. 

My best advice is (sorry if the format goes weird, I‚Äôm on mobile);

Have someone with you throughout. My husband stayed home with me and just basically assisted in everything.

Unless you‚Äôre a night owl, I suggest starting the process during the day. I went grocery shopping, picked up protein bars, green smoothies and other things like Gatorade and coconut water for the delivery itself. Then I had a big healthy breakfast for energy, had a shower and washed my hair (wasn‚Äôt sure if I‚Äôd want to anytime soon after). I started at 11am and finished by around 5:30pm - I was in bed asleep by 6. I think this helped my recovery somewhat because it meant my sleeping habits didn‚Äôt change.

As others suggested, ask for prescription grade painkillers if you can. I am partial to opiates due to my Crohn‚Äôs disease disallowing use of NSAIDs. The pain was bearable but towards the end it was good to have something to take the edge off.

Have more towels than you think you will need to hand. I bled a fair amount and though my gigantic pads could handle most of it, side leaks happen if you‚Äôre lying down! I covered the bed in towels, and always had some extra in the bathroom. 

Speaking of pads, don‚Äôt get the slim night time ones but go for the thick old school ones. This was a recommendation from my OB because it gives you a better sense of whether you are bleeding enough to soak a pad or not. The thin ones have that absorbing gel that can be misleading.

I love data and organisation so I had a small notebook which my husband was in charge of. He noted times I took painkillers and the amount, when I changed a pad and whether it was full. Both are important to keep track of should you need any medical help later. If you are soaking more than 2 thick pads an hour, you should give your doctor a call. 

When the pain gets to the point where you don‚Äôt know if you can handle it, that usually means it‚Äôs almost over. I started freaking out when the contractions got to be very close together so I couldn‚Äôt refocus my breathing. Within 10 minutes it was all over.  If it‚Äôs very prolonged and unbearable, called your doctor just in case. 

I spent a lot of time on the toilet, it makes things a bit more comfortable when you feel larger clots passing. If you don‚Äôt want to pass baby or tissue into the loo, I recommend getting something like a sitzbath (sitsbath?) to catch everything. I had a suspected partial molar so needed to bring the placenta to the hospital. This also allowed us to physically bury our baby which for me personally, provided some closure. 

Have some movies or tv shows lined up to watch, for some the process is pretty slow. I couldn‚Äôt concentrate on anything during and instead listened to an audio book.

Keep an eye on how you feel for a few weeks after. Fever and things like this are worth getting checked out. I retained some tissue and doctors threatened a D&C which I did NOT want.  My midwife suggested abdominal massage and sure enough, after I had a rather aggressive abdominal scan to check for tissue, I passed everything. I also developed a 40.5C fever a week later but it turned out to be viral not bacterial. D&C avoided narrowly but lots of scans and testing was done to make sure. Be as thorough as you can. If a D&C is really needed, then that‚Äôs ok. Always get these things checked out! 



Mostly just be patient with yourself and the process. It‚Äôs a long and horrible road to go down. I hope it goes smoothly for you! ",[],,t1_e9tl4e3,0,False,"<div class=""md""><p>First of all, I‚Äôm so sorry for your loss. This is just the worst. </p>

<p>I found out at my 11 week scan that baby had passed at 10 weeks. I decided to wait for my body to figure it out since I hate hospitals! 5 weeks later, I had tried acupunture, drinking copious amounts of red raspberry leaf tea and even jumping on a trampoline. My body other than releasing some of my mucus plug, didn‚Äôt figure it out.</p>

<p>I used 4x misoprostol vaginally at the highest dose. Within 40 minutes I started cramping but no blood.  20 minutes after that my waters burst (was NOT expecting that!). Then the bleeding started. Within 6 hours I had delivered baby and placenta together. </p>

<p>My best advice is (sorry if the format goes weird, I‚Äôm on mobile);</p>

<p>Have someone with you throughout. My husband stayed home with me and just basically assisted in everything.</p>

<p>Unless you‚Äôre a night owl, I suggest starting the process during the day. I went grocery shopping, picked up protein bars, green smoothies and other things like Gatorade and coconut water for the delivery itself. Then I had a big healthy breakfast for energy, had a shower and washed my hair (wasn‚Äôt sure if I‚Äôd want to anytime soon after). I started at 11am and finished by around 5:30pm - I was in bed asleep by 6. I think this helped my recovery somewhat because it meant my sleeping habits didn‚Äôt change.</p>

<p>As others suggested, ask for prescription grade painkillers if you can. I am partial to opiates due to my Crohn‚Äôs disease disallowing use of NSAIDs. The pain was bearable but towards the end it was good to have something to take the edge off.</p>

<p>Have more towels than you think you will need to hand. I bled a fair amount and though my gigantic pads could handle most of it, side leaks happen if you‚Äôre lying down! I covered the bed in towels, and always had some extra in the bathroom. </p>

<p>Speaking of pads, don‚Äôt get the slim night time ones but go for the thick old school ones. This was a recommendation from my OB because it gives you a better sense of whether you are bleeding enough to soak a pad or not. The thin ones have that absorbing gel that can be misleading.</p>

<p>I love data and organisation so I had a small notebook which my husband was in charge of. He noted times I took painkillers and the amount, when I changed a pad and whether it was full. Both are important to keep track of should you need any medical help later. If you are soaking more than 2 thick pads an hour, you should give your doctor a call. </p>

<p>When the pain gets to the point where you don‚Äôt know if you can handle it, that usually means it‚Äôs almost over. I started freaking out when the contractions got to be very close together so I couldn‚Äôt refocus my breathing. Within 10 minutes it was all over.  If it‚Äôs very prolonged and unbearable, called your doctor just in case. </p>

<p>I spent a lot of time on the toilet, it makes things a bit more comfortable when you feel larger clots passing. If you don‚Äôt want to pass baby or tissue into the loo, I recommend getting something like a sitzbath (sitsbath?) to catch everything. I had a suspected partial molar so needed to bring the placenta to the hospital. This also allowed us to physically bury our baby which for me personally, provided some closure. </p>

<p>Have some movies or tv shows lined up to watch, for some the process is pretty slow. I couldn‚Äôt concentrate on anything during and instead listened to an audio book.</p>

<p>Keep an eye on how you feel for a few weeks after. Fever and things like this are worth getting checked out. I retained some tissue and doctors threatened a D&amp;C which I did NOT want.  My midwife suggested abdominal massage and sure enough, after I had a rather aggressive abdominal scan to check for tissue, I passed everything. I also developed a 40.5C fever a week later but it turned out to be viral not bacterial. D&amp;C avoided narrowly but lots of scans and testing was done to make sure. Be as thorough as you can. If a D&amp;C is really needed, then that‚Äôs ok. Always get these things checked out! </p>

The article seems to have a purpose of instilling fear, and I still would be wary of a study that doesn't have anything other than an abstract viewable online. 

There is always a risk of adverse events in everything we do. We assess the risk and weigh the pros and cons, and decide if it's worth it to us. There's a risk of being killed in a car accident every time we get in a car, but usually we feel the need to get somewhere outweighs the risk of death. Just like any medical procedure, there will always be a chance of complications. D&C does have a risk of perforation, hemorrhage, future complications, yes, but those risks are very small and the occurrences are very rare. Miscarriages and abort!ons are managed 50/50, with half choosing medical management, the other half choosing surgical. For those of us that have gone the D&C route, we decided the benefits outweighed the risks. In some cases we didn't have a choice in the matter. Many women go on to have successful pregnancies after D&C.

The article and study you linked is deceiving in that it makes the reader think there is both a 29% increase & a 69% increase in preterm labor, but those numbers are in relation to previous, non D&C risk. The actual risk of preterm labor is only from 6% (general population, no previous D&C) to 7.6% (one D&C). Yes, the study I linked was from 2007, but it being a relatively simple procedure, if anything I'd expect current findings to be better, not worse, as there has been 10 years of potential advancement and skill tweaking.

We‚Äôve both always wanted two children. It also never occurred to us that we might lose a baby. That was not on our radar as something that would really, actually happen to us. But here we are. We went to the effort of getting pregnant with our second child, it took 7 cycles, but it happened without intervention. Then everything was normal about the pregnancy, until it wasn‚Äôt. When we got pregnant we finally made the decision to upsize, to move from our starter home to our forever home because we needed the extra bedroom and space. It was about our family and what we as husband and wife wanted and thought was going to happen. We had no suspicion nor any way of knowing that anything would go wrong and that our baby would die at 28 weeks due to a knot in her cord, nor did we have any way of knowing that I would now suddenly have a difficult time getting pregnant again. If I had known even for a second that my son was going to be an only child, I would have never started trying for our second child in the first place. I would have been more present for him over these past almost 2 years instead of dealing with getting pregnant, the exhaustion and morning sickness, the grief and trauma of losing my baby girl and then the stress, pain, and ups and downs of trying to conceive again! As I said and will say again, my son is the light of my life.

That being said, if time is your biggest concern then going the miso route will be your best option. You do still run the risk of needing a D&C if the miscarriage is incomplete. There's a decent number of women here who have had to do both after miso failed. I personally had to do D&C because the products needed to be sent for genetic testing, but had to take miso a month later for retained clots. That failed and only 2 of the 4 pills dissolved.

I think another woman who's been on this sub was a NICU nurse.  And /u/PokeMyEyes, as she mentioned, is a doula.  All such hard jobs after a loss.

Maybe this work you loved is something you can't ever go back to.  Maybe you need more time.  Maybe you'll have to make it through your own PAL before you feel ready to pick up this work again.  

It seems like after a loss, women really appreciate OB's, midwives, doula's, etc. who've been through their own losses.  There's an extra understanding and compassion there.  But not everyone is up for taking that on after a loss.  It's just too triggering and too stressful.

I'll be following this thread because I need help here. I know that I'll be anxious about TTC and then again when we do get pregnant, given I've lived through this hell once now. 

I already see a therapist and highly recommend that. I need to get back into yoga, as I know that will help.

One mantra my therapist told me to repeat was ""don't worry until there's something to worry about."" I tried to follow that, even though it was hard, and am going to continue to do so. 

I think it's so much easier said than done to chill the f out, so be gentle with yourself if you find that you can't. Know that you have people in the same boat, like me, and my partner is also helpful to put me back in check and listen but help me acknowledge and then let go off the panic/anxiety.

Hello, friends. Newbie here as of yesterday :( I suppose I am WTT because I'm still in the middle of a MC. 

Not sure if this is the right thread for this question, but I'm curious how I track a MC in a few different apps. Below is what I've done, but if any of this is wrong, just let me know so I can fix it and at least have control over my apps!

For the sake of the below, my first full day of bleeding was Monday, 11/12. I've switched all the apps back to TCC after logging that I've experienced a loss. I'm counting 11/12 as the day I MC'd:

Fertility Friend - logged 11/12 as ""bleeding"", and also checked the ""MC"" box. They are marking this as CD1.

Femometer - all it let me do is log the day of my MC (i.e. won't let me enter in anything about bleeding)

Ava - started me on a new cycle that began CD1 as the first day of my MC (similar to FF)

Glow - only allowing me to track the MC as a period

&#x200B;

Terminology is kind of personal, but I think because I have a background in vet nursing I'm a little bit of a stickler for correct (medical) terminology. Personally - and no offence - I don't totally like people saying stillborn when their loss was before 20 weeks. I might even be a tiny bit offended if that conversation happened between us IRL, because I'm human and not completely rational 100% of the time. It's absolutely nothing personal. I don't think your loss is any less than mine. I do think the losses are different, though. Not more, not less, just different. I have similar thoughts about my loss compared to someone who had a stillbirth at full term, or a loss in infancy after birth - do they think my loss is less? I'm sure they don't, but I do appreciate the difference between them. Our loss was completely sudden and unexpected and we were *so close* \- but even so I can't imagine having a sudden and unexpected loss at 38-40 weeks. Similarly, it's hard for me to relate to all of the women who have approached me since my loss and told me about their miscarriages - I haven't had a miscarriage, so I don't know what it's like, except that I now have a new deathly fear of having one since everyone's been telling me about them and I've been confronted with how painfully common they are. But at the end of the day, losing a child is much more than losing a clump of cells, or a tiny foetus, or a perfectly and finally formed baby - it's a loss of hopes, dreams, aspirations for the future, it's the loss of the person we've already created in our hearts and minds.

Similarly, it&#39;s hard for me to relate to all of the women who have approached me since my loss and told me about their miscarriages - I haven&#39;t had a miscarriage, so I don&#39;t know what it&#39;s like, except that I now have a new deathly fear of having one since everyone&#39;s been telling me about them and I&#39;ve been confronted with how painfully common they are. But at the end of the day, losing a child is much more than losing a clump of cells, or a tiny foetus, or a perfectly and finally formed baby - it&#39;s a loss of hopes, dreams, aspirations for the future, it&#39;s the loss of the person we&#39;ve already created in our hearts and minds. So, honestly, describe your loss in whatever way feels right to you because it&#39;s really only your opinion that counts in regards to it.</p>

Usually this test is done at 7dpo (as that is the peak) and they're looking for a 10ng+.  The desired range is 10-20, but my specialists are happy above 10. **A result of 3ng could actually mean that you didn't ovulate at all.** I believe that 4 is considered ovulatory, so 3 wouldn't be. OR it could mean that you tested on the wrong day -- too early(usually) or too late. So if you didn't verify ovulation it could all be off. 

I assume your doctor wants to do CD3 testing. Generally for CD3 you test for:

* **Follicle Stimulating Hormone (FSH)** - is produced by the pituitary gland and is responsible for the egg maturation process. High day 3 FSH levels are associated with diminished ovarian reserve.
* **Estradiol (E2)** - is produced by the ovary and levels should be low in the early part of the menstrual cycle. High day 3 levels may indicate a cyst in the ovary or diminished ovarian reserve.
* **Luteinizing Hormone (LH)** - is produced by the pituitary gland and levels are increased before ovulation. A LH/FSH ratio of greater than 2:1 or 3:1 may be diagnostic of Polycystic Ovarian Syndrome (PCOS).
* **Prolactin** - Both luteinizing hormone (LH) and follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) are necessary for ovulation. If, for example, hyperlactinemia is caused by a prolactionoma, a tumor in the pituitary gland, then this could interfere with the secretion of LH and FSH. Any change in LH and FSH can cause ovulation and menstrual abnormalities. The normal range for hormone levels will vary between laboratories.  

It is usually best to follow this testing up with comparison bloodwork around ovulation. FSH, E2, and LH should all be different then.

As for progesterone ""being the issue"" and one that ""you can solve,"" its not that simple. You definitely need to know if you ovulated at all. If you did and the number was that low, its concerning. But it often means an issue with the ovulation/egg and just throwing progesterone at it may not help. You may need to take fertility medication to boost your ovulation. And if you didn't ovulate, you also want to figure out why that is happening...and the same thing may be true in that you could take fertility meds to make you ovulate or enhance your ovulation. And these CD3 tests should help give a bigger picture.

The role of progesterone issues in pregnancy and loss is still highly debated. It is mostly believed that low progesterone during pregnancy is a symptom of the loss not a cause. So, going on progesterone after you have already conceived is still ""controversial"" in that we aren't sure it helps. In fact studies are pretty sure it doesn't do much. But they (doctors) seem to think it doesn't hurt, either. Progesterone supplements (most often) can't hurt. But outside of IVF, there is no concrete evidence that progesterone replacement is helpful. 

Also, progesterone can change each cycle. So one cycle with a low 7dpo result may not mean anything long term and you should check it again a few other cycles.

Also, (big one for you) most specialists believe that if supplementation might help, it needs to be started at 3DPO to possibly have an impact (even though its not proven that it does anything, per say).

I joined ttcafterloss because I trying to conceive.... after loss... and facing the reality that I'll probably keep losing.

But my post is removed because it's a trigger because I'm trying to concieve after a loss?

I track with OPKs and all of that then I get a blood test on CD 21 to see if I've ovulated and if I get to CD 30 without a BFP I start all over.

<p>Now that we&#39;re trying to conceive its obviously a problem. My OB has me on a regimen. I take Provera for 10 days to induce a period, then on CD 3-7 I take Femara to help me ovulate. I track with OPKs and all of that then I get a blood test on CD 21 to see if I&#39;ve ovulated and if I get to CD 30 without a BFP I start all over.</p>

sadly, you're right, if we were a man with ED, we'd be good to go already. It's bullshit.

The midwife I saw through the MC didnt listen to me when I said something wasn't right, I called her for probably 2 months, and she just kept saying ""wait it out, itll get to your normal"". Well, bitch, I am done waiting... so I switched. I actually went back to my original midwife, made an appt, told her I thought I was crazy for making an appointment, and she told me, ""dont you ever feel crazy for not feeling normal, you know your body better than anyone ever will and I am always here for you when you don't feel 'normal'"". She asked me a bunch of questions, what was going on, what wasnt going on, what used to be normal, what the previous midwife did, and didnt, do. She ordered a transvag US to make sure the sac was gone (the MC was detected during our first TVUS for a heartbeat, and showed a soc 6 weeks in size in my lower cervix, I never bled until July, and even though they said it was probably reabsorbed, you dont know!!). She also said where we will go from here, which was amazing. I am a planner, and if this shows nothing, what is next, what will should something and how can we fix this.

&#x200B;

I ABSOLUTELY think you should either see her again and demand something (and not just bullshit tests either, tests applicable to what you have going on), OR make an appointment with someone else. I even asked around town to get good dr reviews, and I called and asked the front desk, I said, this is what I want, who do you have? 

Also, I started reading ""Making Babies: A Proven 3-Month Program for Maximum Fertility"" by Jill Blakeway and Sami S. David, and even though I am only half way through I already feel equipped with questions and possible tests I might need to take to my next appointment.

That's not a statistic I have ever heard and I work in the world of labour and delivery (as a doula). 

The thing about nature is that it isn't thinking. It just is. It doesn't have intentions. Nature on its own only works as well as it can, and are we not a product of nature? Our progress is natural progress, evolution from primal humans with crude tools to doctors who can save lives. I think you should blame whatever feels right for you, of course. But I think nature is also incredibly beautiful in other ways. When you look at all of the good and the bad together, it might become clear that nature produces a spectrum of creatures. 

One way or another 100% of us will die. Not even .001% of births result in the death of the mother and, at it's highest, there is about a .07% infant mortality rate in the world. This only counts infants that die after a live birth. Stillbirth rates are still fairly low. It's miscarriage rates that are quite high, but a massive percentage of those are due to chromosomal issues. That's amazing of nature to see that a fetus is non-viable and end the pregnancy before allowing it to become a baby. Obviously this isn't always the case, and those seemingly random instances are frustrating.

I hope this isn't coming off as rude. Your feelings are valid. I'm just hoping to make you feel a little less angry at the way that nature works. The fact that anyone should suffer the loss of anyone they love is terrible. Natural disasters and sickness are terrible.

The stereotype is that women are the ones that need to be wined, dined, and seduced. Guys should be down to jump in bed whenever and wherever.

Reconception is far more pressure than having sex for fun, or having sex without a previous loss.

If you tried for a pregnancy, and he failed to 'perform', it would lead to MAJOR embarrassment, self doubt, emasculation, and feeling like a failure of a person. It's easier to fall asleep than to deal with the possibility of letting down their wives, family future, and own expectations.

The day before my bereavement ended, my husband and I were downtown and I ran into the parents of one of my students. I felt so ashamed to be caught looking happy when I ‚Äúabandoned‚Äù her child the second week of school. Why?! They were all just fine.

I am sorry for your loss. You are not overreacting. I felt the same towards my husband after our first loss, which was a MMC back in 2015.
Your husband‚Äôs way of handling your loss is very typical of majority of men. To them MMC and even TMFR can be a very abstract idea since they didn‚Äôt touch the physical effect of pregnancy, i.e‚Äùthe baby‚Äù
To add to that, they act as our protector and when they see our health struggles with the loss/es, they feel powerless and they resort to being the ‚Äúnot emotional one‚Äù to help us and be our caregiver.
Having said that, we still need our partners as our emotional support more than just our physical support. 
So I advice you to talk to him about how you feel when he replay to you and say these words to you. He most likely was not ill meaning when he said them. 
You can start by saying how you feel when he say to you ‚Äúit was too early‚Äù by explaining how our hormones from the moment of implantation will make us feel like moms and connected to our babies and when we loose them, even early, we loose what we hoped the future was going to be and we lost our babies. 
As for TTC after loss, I remember how I wanted to desperately wanted be pregnant ASAP after my first loss. I am not getting younger and I know that my years of fertility are getting shorter. 
But after we lost Samy last June, I felt that taking some time to heal emotionally was the best for both of us.
You might wanna consider taking a month or two to heal and connect as a couple and make sex and intimacy fun and happy again for both of you without the pressure of TTC. 
Your mood will improve and your energy will get back as well as your stress levels will go down and that‚Äôs good for TTC.
I think that we women sometimes make TTC very technical and like a very programmed process that will cause our partners to feel the pressure and they end up avoiding it all together, even if they want to get pregnant.
I hope that what I share helps you even if for a bit. And my apologies if it was a bit harsh.
Best of luck

To add to that, they act as our protector and when they see our health struggles with the loss/es, they feel powerless and they resort to being the ‚Äúnot emotional one‚Äù to help us and be our caregiver.
Having said that, we still need our partners as our emotional support more than just our physical support. 
So I advice you to talk to him about how you feel when he replay to you and say these words to you. He most likely was not ill meaning when he said them. 
You can start by saying how you feel when he say to you ‚Äúit was too early‚Äù by explaining how our hormones from the moment of implantation will make us feel like moms and connected to our babies and when we loose them, even early, we loose what we hoped the future was going to be and we lost our babies. 
As for TTC after loss, I remember how I wanted to desperately wanted be pregnant ASAP after my first loss. I am not getting younger and I know that my years of fertility are getting shorter. 
But after we lost Samy last June, I felt that taking some time to heal emotionally was the best for both of us.
You might wanna consider taking a month or two to heal and connect as a couple and make sex and intimacy fun and happy again for both of you without the pressure of TTC. 
Your mood will improve and your energy will get back as well as your stress levels will go down and that‚Äôs good for TTC.
I think that we women sometimes make TTC very technical and like a very programmed process that will cause our partners to feel the pressure and they end up avoiding it all together, even if they want to get pregnant.
I hope that what I share helps you even if for a bit. And my apologies if it was a bit harsh.
Best of luck </p>

It seems crazy to say that... 6 years of unprotected sex and still no baby. We didn't get pregnant at first... but then, all of a sudden, we started getting pregnant really easily, but none of them stuck. We tried meds. We tried IUI. We are trying IVF. 

At times I was neurotic-- I basically ate chicken, vegetables (cooked), and fruits I washed myself. Everything organic. Nothing but water to drink. No ice cream, hummus, or raw anything. No processed meats. At times, I was really upbeat and happily shared information with the in-laws. Sometimes, I felt like I couldn't get enough sex in my life, and there was an 8-month period where nothing was enough to make me climax. 

I still experience moments of grief for the ones we lost, but I also experience grief for the cycles that completely failed. We could have a kindergartner by now, if we had been able to bring a baby home. 

I've been to a lot of therapy. I'm pretty sure my therapy completely funded my therapist's month-long trip to Ecuador. 

You can come out of this okay, but it takes a lot of resilience to do so. You've got to do things that replenish your resilience as the days wear it away. Do you wish you had more time to read? When was the last time you went for a walk just to breathe fresh air and take in the scenery? 

You have to say no to things that diminish your resilience-- even if it makes you seem rude. Going out with that one friend who always drinks too much? Can't do it. Having everyone over for Thanksgiving because your house is the cleanest? Not this year! 

My husband has never experienced the grief I have over our losses. The hardest part for him was watching me be so disturbed. He doesn't think about the losses like I do. They don't pop up in his head like they do in mine. But when I reference the losses in a round about way, he knows which one I'm talking about. He remembers when it was. It's there, but it's just not as insistent for him. 

If you had told me... 6 years ago, that we'd still be trying in 6 years, I wouldn't have believed you. If you would have told me that we'd spend over $50,000, I would have known you were crazy because we don't have that kind of money. If you would have told me, a very good accountant, that I'd happily run up $30,000 in credit card debt when the cash ran out, I'd suggest you be committed. That's all clearly absurd, and yet... here we are. 

Don't postpone joy. Don't discount grief.

When you feel bad, name your feelings and state what you are grateful for. It helps you judge the bounds of your grief. It helps you find your way out of the murky place where no sun can pierce the fog of your heartbreak. Maybe today you feel desolate but you are grateful only for sleep. And maybe next week you are angry but grateful for ice cream. And maybe next month, you feel hopeless, but you are thankful for your husband's warmth in bed as winter closes in. 

And in all things, try to live in the moment. Try to do the thing that feels right at that moment-- not the thing you think you're going to feel like was the right thing a few weeks down the road. Don't try to figure out every right thing for the next x months. Just focus on right now. What feels right in this moment?

&#x200B;

It's fun-- the hope, the dreams, the planning, the considering. These things are a million little celebrations of joy, and joy is not something you should delay. Embrace it when it comes into your life-- let it take over and clear the cobwebs. Let it energize you and turn you into a walking ray of sunshine for however long it lasts. 

&#x200B;

We just keep doing it over and over. Sometimes, things go bad and we get through a whole cycle of trying to get pregnant, getting pregnant, and losing the pregnancy without ever getting excited. To me, those are the sad ones. I like the joy that comes with being excited. It always feels worse afterwards when I didn't get excited. Almost like I wasn't quite in my little one's court. 

&#x200B;

Let the joy in, and celebrate that everything that could be. When the grief comes, it is just as demanding and insistent as the joy... and no one says not to feel the grief. Everyone says it's okay to be sad and desolate. Well, it's also okay to be jubilant and elated. Do what feels good in the moment, and don't worry about what will or won't come after. 

&#x200B;

You told your coworkers because it felt right at the time. You can't take that back, but you shouldn't want to either. My plan for everything is to do what feels right in the moment, and it helps keep me sane. It helps keep me from over analyzing my every decision over the last 6 years.

",[],,t1_e9ed80e,0,False,"<div class=""md""><p>I hope you will. I&#39;m 6 years into this... with no baby, but more losses than any couple should have to endure.</p>

<p>&#x200B;</p>

<p>It&#39;s fun-- the hope, the dreams, the planning, the considering. These things are a million little celebrations of joy, and joy is not something you should delay. Embrace it when it comes into your life-- let it take over and clear the cobwebs. Let it energize you and turn you into a walking ray of sunshine for however long it lasts. </p>

<p>&#x200B;</p>

<p>We just keep doing it over and over. Sometimes, things go bad and we get through a whole cycle of trying to get pregnant, getting pregnant, and losing the pregnancy without ever getting excited. To me, those are the sad ones. I like the joy that comes with being excited. It always feels worse afterwards when I didn&#39;t get excited. Almost like I wasn&#39;t quite in my little one&#39;s court. </p>

<p>&#x200B;</p>

<p>Let the joy in, and celebrate that everything that could be. When the grief comes, it is just as demanding and insistent as the joy... and no one says not to feel the grief. Everyone says it&#39;s okay to be sad and desolate. Well, it&#39;s also okay to be jubilant and elated. Do what feels good in the moment, and don&#39;t worry about what will or won&#39;t come after. </p>

<p>&#x200B;</p>

<p>You told your coworkers because it felt right at the time. You can&#39;t take that back, but you shouldn&#39;t want to either. My plan for everything is to do what feels right in the moment, and it helps keep me sane. It helps keep me from over analyzing my every decision over the last 6 years. My eventual birth plan will consist of &quot;get the baby out of me as safely as possible while doing the things that feel right in the moment.&quot; </p>

The science was so so helpful. Just knowing that it wasn't my fault, being thankful that I was able to find out early, and having so many answers along the way was great. Not sure if you plan to find out the gender. I did and I'm both glad and annoyed that I did. It gave him an identity I feel he might not have had if I'd left it unknown.

Even in the radiology department the images are only saved long enough (partially for HIPPA reasons, partly because not much more info can be obtained from images than can be found in a dictated report) to be processed by the radiologist and physician to format a report that makes very specific clinical notations. </p>

Sorry I did not respond right away! I'm happy to share. I saw a fertility specialist that treats women of all backgrounds and health issues with diet first and then clomid. His pregnancy success rates are 90-95% in three months from start of treatment. 

He starts all of his patients on a Low Carb High Fat diet. Eggs, bacon, heavy whipping cream, full  fat cheese, steak, the works! And not just low carb, specifically a ketogenic diet with less than 25-30 carbs per day the first 3 weeks, then 50 the next 4 weeks, then slowly adds back in more carbs from a serving of fruit a day. The goal is to completely reduce the insulin response and other factors that increase the bodys stress response. I am not overweight, do not have PCOS, and yet I was put on the same diet as other women that did have these hormonal/metabolic health issues. 

I also had to give up caffeine completely, of course no alcohol, and reduce my exercise regime to absolutely no cardio, but yoga and light weight training were ok. 

The reason he put me on this is because I had started endurance exercising when I was still in puberty. He theorized that it affected my hypothalamus which then affected my fertility. My body always thinks I'm under stress and ended the pregnancies (lots of CPs) so the goal was to eliminate stress completely. I never even made it to the hysteroscopy that was ordered and I never got to fill my prescription for clomid. They told us not to abstain from sex at all for the sake of testing. This absolutely works for me. If I didn't experience this first hand I would never have believed it. 

A coworker of mine had a younger sister that had a lot of difficulty conceiving. She was relatively thin too with no medical history. She saw the same doctor at another location, went on the same diet, and was pregnant with her now son 2 months later.

Generally, doctors assume that the baby died at the point it stopped growing.  But it can take some days for the body to figure out that things aren't okay, and begin the miscarriage process.  

And as others have said, your cold or your exertion didn't cause your miscarriage.  Speaking from experience, infections, (pregnancy-safe) antibiotics, a fairly substantial day-long hike with lots of elevation, can happen all between 2 + 5 and 6 + 5 weeks, and baby can be okay at the dating scan that follows.

It can be simultaneously both scary and reassuring to know that there's not a lot we can control in the early weeks.  Reassuring because it's not our fault.  Scary because there's not something we can do to guarantee it won't happen to us again.

Like you, I&#39;ve had friendships that have strengthened because of my loss but I&#39;ve had many that were a bit of a &#39;reality check&#39; for me because people just disappeared or if we have seen each other since my loss it&#39;s so superficial and they avoid the subject. Give yourself permission to hang on or let go to these relationships - it is your life and you get to decide who gets to be part of it. If you feel like you owe it to yourself to see this friend one more time, then do that. But if you&#39;re ready to cut her from your life, that&#39;s also okay. One thing I will say is that a few people who let me down have since then actually apologized about not being there for me because they didn&#39;t know how to be there or what to say. That has helped me let go of some of my resentment but I definitely still have some people I dread seeing at mutual gatherings because the friendship isn&#39;t real to me anymore. Good luck with your decision and I am so sorry for your loss. </p>

I‚Äôm trying to keep spirits up by watching funny tv shows and making as many other parts of my life easier, as much as I can. I so want to be pregnant again, too. It hurts so bad not to be. I hope it happens for us soon. üíï </p>

My advice - Be your own advocate. My hcg was rising and nothing showed on my ultrasound but my GP ( i hadnt been given an OB yet because I was at just 9 weeks when I had my ectopic) kept saying she just wants to wait and see and follow my levels. I pushed for more tests and ultrasound bc I knew in my heart it was ectopic. Turns out it was after I spent the day at ER getting tests etc. She said originally she didn't think it was ectopic either bc nothing was showing up. Well in fact it ended up being on my ovary and the OB at the ER said that they saw a small mass in the original ultrasound but thought it was just a cyst so didn't mention it. This could have led to a rupture had I not advocated for myself. So, whatever you think it is, and however you want to treat it - Be your own advocate and ask for what you want. 

And you CAN do it right. This time your body couldn't carry a pregnancy correctly, and is still confused on how to end it, but it doesn't mean it's not able to things right. It is. It will.

My advice - Be your own advocate. My hcg was rising and nothing showed on my ultrasound but my GP ( i hadnt been given an OB yet because I was at just 9 weeks when I had my ectopic) kept saying she just wants to wait and see and follow my levels. I pushed for more tests and ultrasound bc I knew in my heart it was ectopic. Turns out it was after I spent the day at ER getting tests etc. She said originally she didn&#39;t think it was ectopic either bc nothing was showing up. Well in fact it ended up being on my ovary and the OB at the ER said that they saw a small mass in the original ultrasound but thought it was just a cyst so didn&#39;t mention it. This could have led to a rupture had I not advocated for myself. So, whatever you think it is, and however you want to treat it - Be your own advocate and ask for what you want. </p>

<p>And you CAN do it right. This time your body couldn&#39;t carry a pregnancy correctly, and is still confused on how to end it, but it doesn&#39;t mean it&#39;s not able to things right. It is. It will. I feel this pain too, so desperately, especially because it was my first ever pregnancy. So I do know what you&#39;re feeling. It&#39;s so painful.

Yes, you can have a hysteroscopic D&C; it's actually the best way to remove retained products while damaging the uterus the least! The issue is that most general practice ob/gyns don't seem to do them (can't or won't? I don't know), but it doesn't hurt to ask. If you have an RE, they're more likely to be equipped to take care of it that way.

There are two things I‚Äôd tell him.

First, you‚Äôre 0-2 on pregnancies. That‚Äôs rough, I‚Äôm sorry for your losses. They would make anyone worry and the only thing that will make that worry stop is a successful pregnancy. So it‚Äôs not only a matter of being in a hurry to have a baby, it‚Äôs wanting to be free from that worry.

Second, math. If you want 2-3 kids, you need time.
For each you may need 12 months to conceive (normal amount of time) + 9 months, then min 12 months before a subsequent pregnancy.

(12 + 9) + 12 + (12 + 9) + 12 + (12 + 9) = 87 months, a little over 7 years. That‚Äôs just average math. Minimum potential is a little over 5 years if you either get pregnant immediately or push the 1 year pregnancy gap. Maximum could be higher as losses can add time.

Then figure out how old you will be when they start kindergarten or graduate college.

<p>So if you&#39;re concerned, follow those guides, and you should be able to have your bath <em>and</em> have your bases extra covered.  </p>

A hard thing with a blighted ovum can be feeling like you aren't entitled to grieve because ""it wasn't a real baby.""  I'm of the opinion you can grieve just as much as you want.  Just because there's not an embryo big enough to see on the ultrasound, it doesn't mean that maybe once, very early on, it wasn't there.  Maybe it stopped growing so early, and so small, that you can't see it with an ultrasound.  I don't think anyone can say one way or another that that didn't happen in any given case.  For that reason alone, I think you're entitled to grieve this loss like any other type of MC, and your husband's comment is off base.  

And regardless of the status of the embryo, you've lost what you thought was a healthy pregnancy, hopes for its future, expectations of becoming parents.  All of that is worth grieving, too.  

FWIW, some people cope with loss by trying to minimize it, and that might be what you're husband's trying to do.  And it's okay for him to deal with this loss the way he wants to.  But you also get to deal with this loss the way *you* want to.  Hopefully you'll be able to give each other space to do that, while still being supportive.  

Unfortunately, I don't have D&C advice to give, but hopefully others will respond.

A 2016 study showed that time to conceive & rates of pregnancy loss & live births for those who started trying 0-3 months after their MC were at least as good as those who waited 4+ months.

My sense is one of the main reasons to wait is to make sure your hCG goes back down. Benefits are: 1.) no false positives on the pregnancy tests/confusion about a CP vs. residual hCG, & 2.) confirmation that there's no retained tissue.  

So it's good that you're getting your hCG tracked. You're taken care of on that front. 

Since that's the case, I think it's kind of up to you when you start TTCing.  It would generally be safe to conceive.  That doesn't guarantee your body won't need a few cycles to find its rhythm, though. (Mine were wonky for a while, and I didn't get a positive OPK until my 4th cycle post-loss.)  But if you feel better to track, try, and see how it goes, I don't think there's much harm in ""not waiting so long.""

FWIW, in the study I mentioned, the women were followed for 6 cycles once they started TTCing.  The majority were pregnant within six, but not e.g. within three cycles. (Yes, ""cycles."")

I'm sorry you have to be a part of this community, but I'm glad you're reaching out for support.  

I lost my son around the same point as you lost Theo.  I'm sure he was tiny, but so amazing and perfect.  

Everything you're feeling is normal.  The devastation, the anger, the feeling that it's so wrong to be picking out an urn for the baby that just spent four months in your belly.  The desire to be pregnant again, the guilt for feeling that so soon after your loss. (I felt it as early as leaving the hospital.)  The inability to deal with pregnancies/babies--especially of family members or close friends for whom you wish you could...  The terribly long wait to TTC again after C-section.  Everything your feeling is normal.  So please let yourself feel however your feeling, and don't get too down on yourself if you're not feeling how you think you ""should"" or ""want to.""  Even laughing again can feel wrong, but it's okay to feel however your feeling in the moment.

On the c-section: a facilitator at my perinatal loss support group *didn't* wait the recommended amount of time. Her uterus ruptured--and it both she and her PAL baby nearly died.  I don't know if they saved her uterus.  She shares her story to encourage others to not do what she did.  Waiting is hard, but it *is* one of the things in our control to minimize risks of problems in the future.  

I'm sorry the support groups haven't gotten back to you.  We went to one that our hospital and my OB both recommended.  It was drop-in, so there was no need to e.g. sign-up in advance.  I found it really helpful (and most participants were there as couples, which I think was good for my husband).  I know that when you're grieving, you only have so much energy, but I hope you can follow-up and find a group.  

Our hospital also connected us with a bereavement counselor who specialized in families who lost children.  That was also really helpful for me.  Others here have gone to private therapists with expertise in pregnancy/perinatal loss.

&#x200B;

You do belong here. You don't have to be actively TTC to be here. Though we are all at different places in our journeys, and have all had different circumstances to our losses, we have all lost babies. We know what an unspeakable agony it is. I have found it a great comfort to be amongst people who have shared this pain.

&#x200B;

I'm so sorry too that you have a close friend with a healthy baby. That is so hard. After my loss, I could hardly stand the sight of a baby, and now, two years later, seeing any children the age my twins would have been still hurts, like a little knife in the heart.

&#x200B;

I have two little pieces of advice, if you want them: one is to try not to feel guilty for wanting another baby. It's the most natural thing in the world to want another baby. Getting pregnant again as soon as possible was all I could think about. Losing a baby is like losing a piece of your soul. It leaves a gaping hole. If you do have another, he or she will not be a replacement for Theo; he will always be your firstborn. Your next baby will simply be his little brother or sister. He probably would have had a sibling or two if he had lived; this is no different.

&#x200B;

My second piece of advice is to let yourself feel every bit of your grief. Talk about Theo. Say his name. Cry for him. Be angry. Don't try to move on too quickly. The people in your life who haven't lost babies probably won't understand. They might tell you to get over it, that you should move on. If you get pregnant again, they might think that makes everything all better. You might start to think you're crazy for still being sad after a few months, a few years. You aren't crazy. You lost your child. This is the kind of grief that you don't get over; you learn to live with it. It does get better - I promise!! - but it takes a long time, and you won't ever be exactly the way you were before. This changes you. But if you embrace your grief, if you dive in headfirst and don't try to suppress it or ""move on,"" you will find your way through more easily. You will know joy again. But probably not soon. And that's ok. That's normal. ",[],,t1_e8tfv6h,0,False,"<div class=""md""><p>First of all, I am so sorry for the devastating loss of Theo.</p>

There is s just SO MUCH to worry about in this whole process. And even if someone know that (I didn't ) they don't truly understand that if they haven't experienced loss.

So all I can say is that you are not alone. And I get you. And I can assure you that I have anxiety and concerns of all kind regarding pregnancy. Both in the scenario where I won't get pregnant ever again and in scenarios where I will.

As for testing I would do what you feel is emotionally best for you. No, it's not too soon, you can take your test whenever you want, it's not silly or weird. You can always test again later if it's going to be negative. I personally like to monitor what is going on with my body. It's your body and you can monitor as much as you please. But if you feel like a BFN would make you upset, then don't test just yet. Wait a couple more days and try to focus on something else (easier said than done).

Here are the lifestyle things I learned over the years that helped me, in addition to antibiotics and antifungals as needed. Just in case it helps. I used to cry because it was unbearable some days!!!
1. If I drink too much green tea or eat too many spicy foods for consecutive days I will get that stinging pee discomfort feeling. I have NO idea why. Doctors can‚Äôt explain it, but elimination helped me. Alcohol will trigger too so I limit.
2. Probiotics regularly 
3. I sleep in a night gown with no panties on. If it‚Äôs cold and I need warmer pajamas, cotton panties are a must!
4. Preseed during sex, even non TTC sex has helped me so much! Irritation from even minimal dryness would trigger all kinds of imbalances and regular lube would irritate too. 
5. I ask my partner to wash up before we get intimate and I pee after sex too. 



Some things are regular practice for many women but worth repeating. I hope you feel better. I fought like heck to solve my problem so I know the struggle and tiredness. I wanted to give up! It felt like an eternity! I didn‚Äôt have the same bacteria as you so this may not help or be relevant but thought I would share my story.

I have had some random things, and I am just frustrated, and 6 months later, still don't feel ""normal"". I told her I felt so silly making the appointment and she said dont you ever feel silly about questioning your body not feeling ""normal"". It was so reassuring, she ordered another ultrasound to make sure everything was clear, a progesterone test after I ovulate, and was a wealth of knowledge. She also had answers for different routes we can take after these results come back. All in all, I think you should have answers, and I am so sorry you don't, and until you do, switch Dr's, OBGYN's, Midwifes, anything, until you find someone that treats you like their only patient that day.

When you‚Äôre so far along it may take you 8-9 weeks to get your period back and it may not be normal at all. It may be lighter or heavier.

Maybe it was from not waiting maybe not but I didn‚Äôt wait and TTC right after my losses. I wish I waited at least a month or two after that. It took me 9 weeks after our TFMR to get my period back and it was super light 2 more periods to the point I was not even sure it was a period meaning my lining probably hasn‚Äôt built back up which would have also resulted in more loss. I think the earlier you are it‚Äôs probably ok but by the time second tri hits so many changes in your body happens. Also the milk coming in changes your prolactin hormones which affect other hormones which is why women can‚Äôt usually get pregnant while breastfeeding. 

It‚Äôs TOTALLY normal to want to try again ASAP but that part of my brain was irrational bc nothing does change waiting just one more month but may mean a healthier baby. I didn‚Äôt see a point of waiting much before, but now since this happened to me I air on side of caution.

It‚Äôs a really shitty waiting game until you find out. 

I think I can speak to the IUD topic. I have severe endometriosis and I had a Mirena placed after a surgery to try to clear some of the endo up (I lost an ovary and tube during the surgery but that‚Äôs a whole other story).

Anyhow, because of my extreme prolonged periods, I had low iron for years, so I‚Äôve been seeing a hematologist for about 8 years now. Basically, she deals with blood disorders and such. While I trust my family doctor super well, she has told me I could try to conceive as soon as the IUD came out.  My hematologist on the other hand, who specializes in blood, says I should give myself 2-3 healthy periods (as in a full blown period rather than spotting) before I try. 

Here‚Äôs her logic: depending on how long you‚Äôve had an IUD (and if it‚Äôs a Mirena), one of the main purposes of an IUD is that it thins the lining of your uterus. As it thins, your periods become lighter with an IUD because you are not developing as much lining every month. This is also partially how you do not get pregnant as well - the lining is not vascular enough to provide a good environment. 

So when you get an IUD out, that lining can take a bit to build back up. Especially if you have low iron like myself! A full blown period is a good sign you have generated a healthy lining. 

With all of this said, you definitely can‚Äôt summarize a miscarriage because of an IUD. There‚Äôs just so, so many factors to consider and things to go wrong in the early stages of pregnancy, so please do not blame yourself for not waiting longer to try! I know what it‚Äôs like to search for a reason why and more often than not, I‚Äôve never gotten a solid answer.

As many of you said - I know my daugther best and I know she is strong and have taught her being open and not being scared of anything including death.

My birth was so fast I didn't get to recieve any medication to relief pain so it was very hard and I was of course very scared. After the birth I really wanted to see both of my kids together.
So my big girl came with my parents. She was of course very happy to see me and asked me where the baby was. She saw her little sister and was so proud of her. She becan to sing 'Itsy bitsy spider' to her like when the baby was in my stomach. She commented on her little hat and that she had eyes, a nose and a mouth. She even kissed her and stroke her very gentle. She kept saying ""shh baby is sleeping"" and we had to answer ""no sorry the baby is not sleeping - it's dead"". She wanted to hold her and she held her three times. I was weird being so happy and proud and filled with grief at the same time. 

After 1,5 hour it was getting late and my husband took our daughter home while I spend the night with the baby at the hospital (it was my own choice since I wasn't ready to leave her yet). The next morning my husband and daughter came alone. The first thing she asked was to see and hold the baby again. I let her but this time she understood the baby was dead. She said the baby wasn't moving and she was very cold, so my daughter kind of pushed her away. It was hard but I knew it was time for me to say goodbye too.  We stayed untill noon because I had to be examined before leaving. I said goodbye to the baby and cried. We sang and waved goodbye as the staff took her away. 

Now we are home and everything feels back to normal except I'm not pregnant anymore and keep crying when thinking about how unfair it is that my little girl didn't get to survive. Luckily we have hand- and footprints, lots of photos and the hat and blanket she first weared when she was born (we changed it so I could keep it) and we even got identical knitted teddybears for both of my daughters from the hospital (littlesister will ofcourse be cremated with hers). I really feel like this experience will help us grow stronger as a family.

I was also due on Valentine‚Äôs Day, and I had a MMC at what should‚Äôve been 12 weeks, with the baby measuring 8+1 (which was the day of my last, totally normal ultrasound). Your story reminded me very sadly of mine; I was at the rehearsal dinner for my best friend‚Äôs wedding (as MoH) across the country, ended up in the ER, the next night my dad had a sudden cardiac arrest, during the day waiting to get to my parents I started hemorrhaging blood and huge clots, and finally ended up in an ER at the hospital my dad was in in labor. Life didn‚Äôt stop just because I was going through this.</p>

<p>It‚Äôs traumatic enough losing a baby, but losing it and then going through the blood and hospitals and contractions is so much extra. I am so sorry you had to go through all of that in addition to the pure loss. I feel like I at least have gone through a mix of grief and PTSD, and it‚Äôs been a slow road to feeling ‚Äòbetter‚Äô.

I'm currently going through a MC as well. When I was barely 4 weeks, I started spotting. At first, only a little each day. An early ultrasound showed an egg sac, but they couldn't tell if anything was actually wrong. When the bleeding became a little heavier (like day 3 of a period) I got in for another ultrasound at 6+1, and they only found the egg sac again. No yolk sac or fetal pole. This was Friday.

The doctor sat with me and kindly told me I didn't do anything wrong, that these things just happen sometimes. She said because it was so early and because I was already bleeding, I should just let it happen naturally.

I didn't expect to have it happen the very next day--yesterday--at a sports bar. I bled through my thin pad (which had been all I needed up to then), my underwear, and my pants. I left my husband and toddler, drove home, and sobbed in the shower as blood and clots fell out of me. Up until then I thought maybe the doctor and ultrasound tech were wrong; that I would return for an exam in two weeks and shock everyone by having a heartbeat in my belly. The reality of the situation hit me.

I'm still bleeding, but not as heavily. We'll see if everything's come out this week, and if not they'll schedule a D&C.

I am so sorry for your losses. RPL is very hard.

I will summarize what my RE told me at my last visit. There are the following causes for repeated pregnancy loss:

- genetic issues
- hormone imbalance issues
- immune system issues
- blood clotting issues
- anatomical issues
- unexplained

Usually you do the testing starting with the least invasive.

The first thing that I did was to do a blood test to check my thyroid function, glucose and prolactin levels (the most common the hormone issues), coagulation and lupus antibodies (the most common immune issues). If I were you, I would start by asking my doctor to order these tests. You can also do CD3/CD27 testing to check your hormones during a normal cycle.

Once those issues were ruled out, I did genetic testing (karyotype) to rule out (some) genetic issues.

If you can rule that out as well, the next step is to do an HSG/SHG to check that there are no anatomical issues (e.g. no septum or fibroids in the uterus etc.)

I hope this helps!",[],,t1_e8lpgjr,0,False,"<div class=""md""><p>Hi! I am copying and pasting my answer to a very similar question yesterday. </p>
