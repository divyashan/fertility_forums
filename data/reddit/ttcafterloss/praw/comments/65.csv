Telling him about our MC, definitely shut him up, but having this information, the wife NEVER ONCE reached out to me, like I assumed, as a mom and someone who should be a decent human being would. But nope. Never even a text to see how I‚Äôm doing, and that makes my anxiety toward her that much deeper. </p>

<p>Maybe I‚Äôm over reacting, it‚Äôs only been two months since my loss, and I still have some bad days. But at the moment, I can‚Äôt even find the strength to be happy for anyone. </p>

<p>My husband taught me how to ‚Äúmute‚Äù people on Instagram that night. He‚Äôs my knight in shining armor! </p>

My husband is in a completely different place from me, I don&#39;t think he really gets why I&#39;m still in such a sad place, which makes it really hard. I know he just wants to see me be happy again, but that&#39;s not realistic for me right now.</p>

We are currently 23 weeks after our first try of that :) Who knows if it would‚Äôve worked without it, but it gave me so much peace of mind to be monitored and try something different! Good luck to you and feel free to ask more questions. </p>

It's #pauseforpbd day and #lilyplants 

PBD is the technical term for the disorder lily had and my friend decided that because we wanted to plant something in her memory today she would take lily's nick name (lily pants) and make a cute # out of it :)

So #pauseforpbd is the Global Foundation for Peroxisomal Disorders  awareness day!

Already my fb newsfeed is flooded with stories from other families and then sweet friends stopping for a moment to post something in memory of Lily. 


 If you're a science person, take a minute to research some of the things we are trying to change in PBD, if you're a person for the people, take a minute too look up some of the care giver quality of life reports. 

And if you have money to spare, give to gfpd, this helps fund research, parent resources, and even some supplies for kiddos with Pbd, or even buy an Amazon gift card for lilyslist.org 

Which is the organization I started to help kids like lily. Or just check out the lily's list social media pages:)

Here's another data point for you:  I've had some lower back pain since I threw out my back from work-related lifting a number of years ago.  (Early on, I went to physical therapy and learned exercises to strengthen my core and support my back.)  

I haven't had many issues in the last couple of years, but I expected pregnancy to start putting stress on my back.  Through the time I delivered my son at ~23 weeks, though, I had no back issues.  I had a 21 hr induced labor with my son (including some back labor), and eventually an epidural.  

Maybe 2-3 months postpartum, I had a bout of terrible lower back pain--to the point that I needed my husband's help with just a basket of laundry and was really worried I was about to throw it out again.  I started up with my PT exercises again and was really careful about postures, activities, etc..  

Coincidentally, I was talking to my neighbor a few weeks later, and she was talking about her work in urgent care, and mentioned (without me having said anything about my issues) how she sees a lot of people who come in with back pain that stems from stress or depression.  And I thought to myself, ""Maybe that's me!""  

I've been laid up on a couch for days barely able to move due to a physical back injury, and PT helped me a lot.  So I definitely advocate getting everything checked out medically and addressing physical issues where possible.  

But having had this recent bout of serious back pain when I was really feeling down post-loss (almost like I was backsliding in feeling better), and learning that the way your body carries tension from stress & depression can result in back pain....makes me appreciate that contribution, too.

Our neighborhood is wonderful.

We moved into the neighborhood in January. All the neighbors, even if we haven't met them, must have seen me get bigger and waddle around as I got closer and closer to August. 

After Georgia died a few days before my due date, my husband let our closest neighbors know. 

In the two months since then, we've gotten homemade meals left on our doorstep, notes, a giant basket of wine and crackers and stuff, flowers, and today, two big pots full of planted flowers and decorative plants. The note just said they thought we might like them. No signature. We got a card a few weeks ago signed by like 5 houses, most of them we've never even met. 

The best is a woman who has a one year old son. When she found out I was pregnant, she was so excited to have a playmate for her baby. 

When I saw her for the first time after Georgia's death, she walked over and just hugged me. When she was walking over, it was with such purpose- she had such a determined look on her face, I honestly thought for a moment that she was angry and coming over to yell at me. It was a fierce look. But I realized it was a ""mama bear"" protective type of look. And she just held me as I cried in the middle of our street. I really felt loved in that moment. 

Losing my baby sort of destroyed my faith in good and wholesome things, if that makes sense. But these people are definitely helping restore it. 

So today I made a big sign out of taped together printer paper saying ""thank you everyone"" and I put it in our window. I hope they know how much they means to us.

Your mom wasn&#39;t sure how to ask you how best she could help you grieve, so she asked you to ask your therapist. Your therapist (like a good one) helped you draft the list. However, your mom probably sees it as all advice from your therapist, she liked it, and thinks she might be able to talk or communicate with you better in a counseling session.

It was hard not breaking down in the store when the cashier commented that this must be one lucky, little girls birthday. 

It was so hard and so bittersweet. I talked to my oldest about her sister. She just thought it was awesome to have cake and let a balloon fly. 

And know that our rainbow is here I can see how amazing she‚Äôs doing as a big sister too.

A little backstory about me, to establish some common ground. My daughter was diagnosed with Trisomy 18 at 28-30ish weeks and she was stillborn at 32 weeks. A late, fatal diagnosis. 

A baby shower, an assembled stroller, shelves full of books --there are many ways to prepare for a baby. There's no way to prepare for the loss of your baby.

I remember vividly thinking,""how can I choose to induce knowing that will be the end?"" Luckily, the thought is not as haunting a year and half out as I expected it to be.

What we did and what I would recommend: we spoke to the hospital staff and decided to only do comfort care (if she were to be born alive). This meant I knew no tubes, or needles, or rushing around -- just a calm room full of love. It's weird, looking back, I've found myself grateful that she was stillborn so that I never had memories of her struggling. Other things, we were given a bear at the hospital which we took a picture of of daughter with and that bear slept with me for a year after our loss -- it was comforting to have some item with physical connection. Next, we did have a memorial service which was a real moment of closure for us. It gave us a chance for us and others to acknowledge the loss of our daughter and of our dreams for her. The local funeral home provided space for us at no cost. We did pay for her cremation at a discounted rate. Lastly, after loss, we did attend a support group for pregnancy and infant loss hosted by the local hospitals which was incredibly helpful.

Feel free to go through my post history to see the advice I was given prior to my loss by the community and  then where I am now. The people on this forum, their stories and advice, really made me feel connected with others despite feelings so alone in life.

Given how many people have responded about time off, I won't pile on.  

I'll just say that *before* you talk to your advisor, you might want to talk to the HR person who arranges maternity, medical, and other types of leave for graduate students.  They will be able to help you figure out what is possible, and how to set it up.  

If they are *really* good and experienced (like ours was, before she was hired/promoted away), they will have been through something related before (e.g. ours helped someone in my cohort negotiate a term or two of leave when her mother was dying of cancer) and be able to offer you some advice on how to navigate the conversation with your advisor.  

Since you're doubtful your advisor(s) will be understanding/accommodating, I think it would be better for you, to get your needs met, if you went into the meeting saying, ""X happened.  I need to take leave.  I talked to [grad student admin] and this is the tentative plan.""  I.e. Present it as something already in the works (with some flexibility), rather than as though your asking for permission--which gives advisors the opening to really pressure you to do nothing. 

(It also means that the advisor knows someone else is watching out for you--the grad student admin doesn't have a lot of power, but just knowing that someone in addition to you and your advisor is part of the conversation can encourage them to present a more accommodating attitude.  You can also follow-up--email the admin saying, ""This is what advisor and I have agreed to do"", and cc your advisor.  Just to have a record in writing.)

Advisors *will* be most concerned about you staying on track to publish, graduate, etc.  If there's resistance, that's where it will stem from.

(Don't overpromise though, and set yourself up for extra stress when you come back--you'll still be dealing with grief, the stress of returning, etc.  If you end up having to move your defense back 4-8 weeks in the end, it's not a big deal (provided that is doesn't slide into summer when your committee members are off-campus).  

Good luck!",[],,t1_e6vt9ev,False,0,[],False,"<div class=""md""><p>I&#39;m so sorry for your loss.  Given how many people have responded about time off, I won&#39;t pile on.  </p>

<p>I&#39;ll just say that <em>before</em> you talk to your advisor, you might want to talk to the HR person who arranges maternity, medical, and other types of leave for graduate students.  They will be able to help you figure out what is possible, and how to set it up.  </p>

<p>If they are <em>really</em> good and experienced (like ours was, before she was hired/promoted away), they will have been through something related before (e.g. ours helped someone in my cohort negotiate a term or two of leave when her mother was dying of cancer) and be able to offer you some advice on how to navigate the conversation with your advisor.  </p>

<p>Since you&#39;re doubtful your advisor(s) will be understanding/accommodating, I think it would be better for you, to get your needs met, if you went into the meeting saying, &quot;X happened.  I need to take leave.  I talked to [grad student admin] and this is the tentative plan.&quot;  I.e. Present it as something already in the works (with some flexibility), rather than as though your asking for permission--which gives advisors the opening to really pressure you to do nothing. </p>

<p>(It also means that the advisor knows someone else is watching out for you--the grad student admin doesn&#39;t have a lot of power, but just knowing that someone in addition to you and your advisor is part of the conversation can encourage them to present a more accommodating attitude.  You can also follow-up--email the admin saying, &quot;This is what advisor and I have agreed to do&quot;, and cc your advisor.  Just to have a record in writing.)</p>

I can relate to what you're going through--both as a grad student and as a TFMR mom.

&#x200B;

When I had my TFMR at 16 weeks, I happened to have a very inflexible schedule (I'm in the MD portion of my training now). So, I took only 4 days off from work (Tuesday laminaria placement, Wednesday D&E, Thurs/Fri recovery, back to work 50 hrs/week on Monday). I actually had an insane schedule for the 6 weeks after my D&E, which, at the time, was actually useful for me. I preferred keeping busy and distracting myself. I had a more flexible schedule after that, which allowed me some time to process things emotionally after some of the rawness had subsided. Recovery after late losses like these is so personal, though--I was fortunate that the physical component of my recovery was very smooth. I had some cramping, and the ongoing bleeding was difficult to deal with (and I also started lactating while in clinic one day and wasn't prepared...), but besides that, I was physically fine.

&#x200B;

I did a PhD prior to starting med school, so I can appreciate how difficult it is to ask for time off. It's not straightforward like it is in a ""normal job."" On the one hand, grad school offers lots of flexibility--no one's telling you what hours you need to be working. But on the other, it offers no protected time off (I don't know about your school, but grad students aren't unionized at mine). So every vacation or medical leave becomes some sort of personal negotiation with your advisor. It's so psychologically fraught--particularly if you've had bad experiences with it in the past. So, I completely get that.

&#x200B;

But I have to say...fuck 'em. Take as much time as you need. Based on what you described re: your previous loss, I think 3-4 weeks (minimum) would be appropriate. There is \*no reason\* your thesis needs to be in at a particular time, and there is \*no need\* for a goddamn committee meeting right now. People in academia have a terrible way of losing sight of the relative importance of work and life (e.g., I remember requesting a few days off for my grandfather's funeral, and my advisor said, ""*sigh* Well, sometimes life gets in the way of science.""). Any TFMR, let alone a late one, is utterly devastating. Take the time you need and screw anyone who gives you push back. This is not a time when you should be worrying about appeasing your advisors.

&#x200B;

We also had a loss where we kept receiving worse news with every check-up and phone call.  We had some great, compassionate providers--but also a couple who were very insensitive (e.g. playfully laughing about the baby just before walking us into an office next door and telling us that at best, baby needed heart surgery and at worst, baby had a termination-worthy genetic disorder).  

No environment is super compassionate to TFMR losses, but since you're in a particularly hostile one, I want to say this: 

Many people say termination is never right.  But if a baby at 18 weeks or 25 weeks is on life support and dying, they would have no issue with the parents deciding to end support.  Why should another baby not be spared the same suffering, only because the ""life support"" is coming from Mom's body?  It's a double standard.  

There are women here whose babies went through prolonged deaths as their bodies failed in the womb over the course of weeks, because their states or hospitals prohibited TFMRs---I fail to see that forcing those tiny, fragile babies through those types of deaths is the ""moral"" choice.  If anything is immoral, it's forcing those babies to go through that type of death.

We don't force babies in the NICU to stay on life support if they're e.g. deteriorating towards heart failure.  We don't force them to stay alive on support until their bodies just give out.  We allow parents to make a decision.  And it should be no different for babies in the womb.  

People also say it's not right to ""play God"" by chosing to end a life.  But again, when e.g. a grandparent is dying, it's okay to decide to end support.  In that situation, people seem to understand that the person is going to die--the only decisions left are when and with how much suffering.  It's the same for situations like yours: there was no decision to make about life or death--only when and with how much suffering.

I went to a bereavement counselor and loss support group after my loss--but I understand why those resources might not be available to you where you live.  Along with this sub, there is an online community, [Ending a Wanted Pregnancy](https://endingawantedpregnancy.com/), and they have a private Facebook group that some people here have found to be a good source a support, and a safe place to talk about your loss.  (Note: recently a couple members had trouble joining because the registration e-mail went to their spam folder.)  

They might not be practical to acquire, but I also found two books helpful after my loss: Our hospital gave us  [*A Time to Decide A Time to Heal*](https://www.amazon.com/Time-Decide-Heal-Difficult-Decisions/dp/1878526391), and our library had [*The Prenatal Bombshell*](https://www.amazon.com/Prenatal-Bombshell-Continuing-Pregnancy-Diagnosis-ebook/dp/B00Y2A3JXE). Both are helpful, non-judgmental guides for navigating this type of loss. The former is a short quick read that my husband and I did together. The latter is a more detailed book that covers everything including TFMR, perinatal hospice, having a child with disabilities, and what comes after these things.  

These are very early days for you and your husband.  Just do your best to take care of yourselves and each other right now, and grieve your loss of Felicia in whatever way feels right.  

My bereavement books mentioned that everyone grieves in different ways and at different paces--when my husband and I got to that point, it was helped me to know that that was normal.  Still, it made me feel a bit lonelier.  Groups like this sub are a big help.

And then you can make plans together to encourage you to stick to them. I would try to make plans with friends that did not involve drinking and that helped to get out of the cycle too. 
And lastly, if you are not already, speaking to counselor, support group, getting on medication. Those things REALLY helped me.

Another thing that helped me was planning something fun or creative for myself after work. I started coloring, journaling, I learned how to knit. All these things helped to fill my time with something constructive rather than destructive. 
And then of course there is family/friends. Perhaps reaching out to someone in your support system to let them know you are ready to make changes? And then you can make plans together to encourage you to stick to them. I would try to make plans with friends that did not involve drinking and that helped to get out of the cycle too. 
And lastly, if you are not already, speaking to counselor, support group, getting on medication. Those things REALLY helped me. They stopped the negative thought cycle I was in that talked me out of making progress. My therapist would help me make weekly goals and then again you are accountable to someone. </p>

My husband and I also chose to TFMR in May at 22 weeks when we learned of the severe heart defects out baby girl had at our anatomy scan after every other test had been normal. We were in a similar boat, if our baby survived to birth she'd have to have constant open heart surgeries her entire life, beginning right after birth. There was no cure or permanent fix for her condition, she'd never be able to live or work on her own, and would likely have severe mental and developmental problems related to a lack of oxygen from the heart condition. We knew we couldn't justify putting her through so much suffering for such a short and hard life as well. We didn't feel like we could provide all the support she needed even if we thought it was ethical to put her through such pain and suffering, and if something ever happened to us we don't have any close family to ensure she'd be looked after.

The moment when I had to get the shot to stop her heart will forever be the worst moment of my life and it's burned into my memory. I cried myself to sleep every night for at least the first 2 months after. I wanted nothing more than to just disappear.

One thing that has really helped me is the Headspace app. They have real y good meditations on grief and sadness, and great meditations to help me sleep (both the sleep meditations and the sleepcasts help a lot). I was having a hard time keeping haunting images from the hospital out of my mind and they'd send me to such a dark place that was hard to get out of.

I hope time will ease your pain. You will never forget your daughter, she will always fill a special place in your heart. I hope you can eventually find some peace and know that you did the best thing for her that you could and that's what makes you a great parent.

But there's also nothing wrong with hoping/expecting that one day, this will be in your past, and life will feel good.  Whatever shape your family takes, you do have stuff going for you (starting with an amazing partner who's traveled this journey with you).

<p>As for counting the weeks, from what I‚Äôve read here, it gets better as time passes. But those milestones will be hard; the due date, conception date, etc. It‚Äôs okay to be sad about it. You might try to push those thoughts out of your head as soon as you feel you‚Äôre mind is going there. I‚Äôve had success doing that, but it takes practice, and doesn‚Äôt always work.</p>

<p>Sending you lots of love. I‚Äôm sorry you had to come here, but I‚Äôm glad you‚Äôve found this awesome and supportive community. We‚Äôre here for you. üíï </p>

We had Natera Horizon 27, Natera Panorama, CVS (Fish and Micro Array), all of which returned no answers for us. It wasn‚Äôt until recently that we received the results of a test that our local children‚Äôs hospital ordered after our termination- whole exome sequencing, which revealed a mutation in her ACTC1 gene. It‚Äôs a protein encoding gene for the heart muscles, leading them to believe she had cardiomyopathy. This is almost always fatal when diagnosed in utero, but nearly impossible to detect with current technology (we had two fetal echocardiograms, both of which came back normal). The micro array is rather expansive, but is not always an end all, be all in our case. 

Our children‚Äôs hospital genetic counselor explained that this was likely a mutation in the initial division of cells and was really just another short straw. The whole exome sequencing also compares the babies genes to the parents and revealed that neither myself or my husband are carriers of the ACTC1 mutation. The likelihood of this happening again is that of any other healthy couple. (I could go on about how meaningless I think odds are these days since I always seem to be the 1 in a million, but I won‚Äôt).

As far as timing goes, I think our micro array took about 4 weeks to come back, but those were from my CVS which I believe requires some time to cultivate. The whole exome took 12 weeks.

We had Natera Horizon 27, Natera Panorama, CVS (Fish and Micro Array), all of which returned no answers for us. It wasn‚Äôt until recently that we received the results of a test that our local children‚Äôs hospital ordered after our termination- whole exome sequencing, which revealed a mutation in her ACTC1 gene. It‚Äôs a protein encoding gene for the heart muscles, leading them to believe she had cardiomyopathy. This is almost always fatal when diagnosed in utero, but nearly impossible to detect with current technology (we had two fetal echocardiograms, both of which came back normal). The micro array is rather expansive, but is not always an end all, be all in our case. </p>

<p>Our children‚Äôs hospital genetic counselor explained that this was likely a mutation in the initial division of cells and was really just another short straw. The whole exome sequencing also compares the babies genes to the parents and revealed that neither myself or my husband are carriers of the ACTC1 mutation. The likelihood of this happening again is that of any other healthy couple. (I could go on about how meaningless I think odds are these days since I always seem to be the 1 in a million, but I won‚Äôt). </p>

The first thing that genetic testing tests for is the right number of chromosomes (e.g. like your set of encyclopedias has the right number of books).   The NIPT specifically checks 3 of the chromosomes (#13, #18, and #21) for extra copies.  Some NIPTs also check that there's the right number of sex chromosomes and that there's not triploidy (an extra set of everything).  

Sometimes, though, a loss is due to one of the other chromosomes being duplicated.  E.g. T16, T2, etc.  These are called ""rare autosomal trisomies"".  This is what the karyotyping will test for--it's still testing that your set of encylopedias has the right number of books, but instead of just checking a couple of the books, it's checking the whole set.  Karyotyping will also check for translocations (e.g. a chunk of book ""M"" is present, but it's sitting in book ""S"".)

If nothing is found at the chromosome (""book"") level, then they move on to microarrays, which look for ""microdeletions"" and 
""microduplications"".   E.g. you have the right number of books in your set of encyclopedias, but one of the books is missing a few pages, or has an extra copy of page 247.  

And if nothing is found at the microarray level, a few places are offering experimental ""whole exome"" testing, where they look for small mutations in individual genes, across all baby's genes. (E.g. You have the right set of books, all with the right number of pages, but there's a typo somewhere.)  I've only seen this offered at research hospitals, because it's experimental, and the only couple we know who had it done didn't get answers from it--they didn't find the problem. (Because the ""exome"" isn't all the DNA, it can still miss things.)  Beyond whole exome testing, the only way to find single gene mutations is to know what gene to look at, based on the symptoms.  

When did it happen?  Could it be inherited?  Most of the time, these issues are not inherited.  

Trisomies often (though not always) happen in the final stages of egg maturation--which is why they tend to happen more frequently as women age.  Occasionally it happens early in embryonic development (mosaicism.)   Either way, that one egg (or occasionally sperm) or embryo is affected, but it doesn't mean all eggs will be affected.

Translocations, microdeletions, and microduplications tend to happen in the early stages of egg or sperm development (i.e. in females, when they are fetuses themselves), or again, occasionally in early embryonic development.  If it didn't happen in the embryo, then the source could equally be mom or dad, and isn't related to the age of the parent.  So usually this means, again, that that one egg or sperm was affected, but others should be okay.  In very rare circumstances, though, it turns out the parent does carry the genetic anomaly--it just didn't cause a problem for them.  So if baby has one of these things, you and your partner will be tested too.  Being a carrier means recurrence risk is higher.  

What's true for translocations and microdeletions/duplications also tends to be generally true for single gene mutations.  It can happen at any point during egg, sperm or embryo development--any time a cell is duplicating.  Possibly associated with father's age (since sperm cells are constantly duplicating).  Rarely, a parent is  a carrier, but hasn't had any problems.  

It's possible that you inherited something from your great-grandmother, but given that your great-grandmother, grandmother, parent, and yourself would all have to be carriers of this gene for you to pass it to your baby, and you're all heart-healthy (as far as you know), it wouldn't be a simple case of ""mutated gene = HLHS"".  More like, mutated gene + other genes from mom & dad + environment + luck = HLHS (or CHD).  

Right now, the state of the science is such that genes like that, what I might call ""risk factor"" genes, are hard to identify.  Right now, these studies are coming out and saying things like ""we found these 253 genes contribute to the chance of developing X.""  But they don't know what those genes do, what mutations are problematic, how much each gene affects risk, etc.   And because of how whole exome sequencing is done (e.g. assuming mom & dad's genes are ""healthy"" and mainly comparing baby for differences), they might not even find the mutation, because they'd see baby had a matching copy of your gene.  Sometimes science is amazing for how much they can do (20 years ago, we hadn't even sequenced on genome yet...now we have whole exome screens at hospitals) and other times, it's frustrating how much it still can't tell us.  :-P

A lot of aspects of your story resonate.  We also had a healthy NIPT, NT, and anatomy scan.  Due to a fluke, we were sent for a follow-up scan of the heart, which is where the first sign of trouble was found.  And from there, the bad news just kept rolling in.  

In our case, they didn't miss my son's condition from negligence (it's just hard to detect), but I still had some anger about the insensitivity of some of our doctors and what was *not* communicated to us as soon as the doctor knew it.  Many things we were only told because I asked, or after our son had died--as if the doctors assumed that if our son was diagnosed with a debilitating condition--particularly one with mental impairment, we'd automatically opt for TFMR, so we didn't need to know, e.g. the details of the heart surgery he'd need.  

We also had an induction, and held our son.  He had a very rare condition (1 in 1-3 million) in which everything appears to be developing properly, but almost nothing functions properly.  And he had a very severe form (8 cases in the literature).  When we held our son, our experience was different, obviously, because he didn't *look* so ill.  The trade-off is that it encourages the ""what-ifs""...  I hope that in your decision to see Vanessa, you get some comfort in knowing (1) that you met her and did for her what you would do for every baby you loved, and (2) that you really had few options, and that you did the best you could for her by making the choice that spared her the most suffering.  

Both when a diagnosis was pending, and after a (different) diagnosis was confirmed, I spent a lot of time reading the medical literature.  There was little I could do for him, but understanding my son's prognosis--being as informed as I could be, not leaving anything out, was one way I could do my best for him.  I hope your research leads to the confirmation of a diagnosis.  It won't bring your daughter back, but it will put a few questions to rest.  

In response to another TFMR mom who just introduced herself, I shared a few resources that helped me after my TFMR [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/ttcafterloss/comments/9iomjn/loss_due_to_cystic_hygroma/e6mjy94/).  And because later TFMR's can be a particularly lonely place, I want to share [this comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/ttcafterloss/comments/80qsbb/intro_our_2nd_trimester_loss_and_moving_forward/duy5d5o/) I received when I first introduced myself--from one of the mods who also had a TFMR at 27 wks.

<p>A lot of aspects of your story resonate.  We also had a healthy NIPT, NT, and anatomy scan.  Due to a fluke, we were sent for a follow-up scan of the heart, which is where the first sign of trouble was found.  And from there, the bad news just kept rolling in.  </p>

<p>In our case, they didn&#39;t miss my son&#39;s condition from negligence (it&#39;s just hard to detect), but I still had some anger about the insensitivity of some of our doctors and what was <em>not</em> communicated to us as soon as the doctor knew it.

Our counselor's specialization was working with families who lost babies or children (or just helping families who had a child in treatment), and so she was more familiar with our type of situation, I think, than the average therapist.  Our hospital also gave use the names of a few private therapists with experience in pregnancy loss--if you get referrals from your previous therapist, I'd try to see one with this experience.  Losing a child is a distinct form of grief, and pregnancy loss involving a TFMR also comes with unique challenges--having someone who knows that from the start is very helpful.   (Also, one person here was recently referred to a therapist by her OB, and the therapist turned out to be ""pro-life"".  *That* was not good.)  

Our hospital and my OB gave us resources for parent support groups--this sub is great, but I also found it helpful to meet other parents in real life who were living all the things we were living.  If you didn't get this information, you can probably search online for groups for TFMR (all based at hospitals in our area) and general perinatal loss (a couple local and national groups in our area).  The closest one to us was an hour's drive, so I only went once a month, but that was still helpful.  (My bereavement counselor cautioned that previous TFMR families had had bad experiences at some of the general loss support groups--they're only as good as the people who attend.  My group was good, but it helped that I contacted the organizer in advance with my concerns, and went with the attitude that if it wasn't helpful, I didn't have to go back.)  

Some people here talk about miscarriage and stillbirth being taboo--but TFMR is in another league.  Especially having mine on the later side--it's tough for me that we're so far away from what the ""political stereotype"" of a late-term abort!on is, and so many people don't understand that.

I feel lucky, though, that (a) like you, we also got good, compassionate care, and (b) we have supportive family and friends with whom we can be open.  

Early on, people talked a lot about finding ""peace"" with everything.  I'm not sure I'll ever feel that's the right word.

I've never regretted that we spared him so much pain and suffering.  I wouldn't call it peace, but my mind has kind of settled on that truth, and I no longer feel the need to grapple with the ""what-ifs"" the way I did early on.

My story is not entirely dissimilar to yours, in that a doctor's lack of due diligence caused us to think everything was fine a lot longer than we should have. At my first ultrasound, I found out I was having twins. I asked if they were identical or fraternal, and the doctor said they were ""probably fraternal."" I asked if I needed to do anything special for a twin pregnancy and she said, ""Buy two car seats instead of one!"" I accepted that and started to get excited about twins. A different doctor did our anatomy scan. The first thing he said was, ""Did you know you're having twins?"" I said yes, and he told me it hadn't been recorded in my paperwork, and that I should have been having ultrasounds much more often because twins are automatically high risk. Then he said, ""Especially identical twins sharing a placenta, like yours. This is an extremely high-risk pregnancy."" I was shocked, because I had thought they were fraternal. Then he told me that they were already showing signs of fluid imbalance, which is a symptom of Twin-to-Twin Transfusion Syndrome, which is 98% fatal to both twins if not treated quickly. He told me to come in again in two weeks for a followup ultrasound, and we'd talk about surgery to save them. At the followup ultrasound, however, neither twin had a heartbeat, and I was induced the next day. Every day since then I've thought about that firs doctor and how careless she was. I wonder if we could have saved our boys if she had followed the correct procedure and scheduled us extra ultrasounds. We go to doctors because they're the experts, and but they're just people. A lot of them are awesome, but some of them are lazy, or stressed, or maybe just not that smart, and you can't know which is which.

It's in 3 weeks, but everything will be free including at least 3 IVF attempts if it comes to that. Ah, the pros (free!) and cons (long wait times) of socialized healthcare.

I got my period back 6 months post partum and my first 3 cycles were anovulatory. We were low-effort preventing by avoiding the fertile window, but managed somehow to get pregnant with either O-4 or O+1 sex. This was in March and I had an MMC at 10+3 in May. We waited one cycle to try again, and didn't get pregnant the following cycle. The one after that I had a CP. And last cycle was a BFN - no surprise there as my husband had issues performing due to the stress of  TTC.

I'm a bit at a loss as to what to tell the doctor. I know CPs don't count as losses, so technically I've only had one loss. Then again, I have only had 4 ovulatory cycles since my son was born, and gotten pregnant on two of them. I'm 35 so 6 months or 6 cycles of trying should be enough, but I haven't technically had that. Then again, I know doctor's here don't put much stock in temping (I guess because of the high risk of user error), so they're likely to consider the 3 anovulatory cycles as 3 extra cycles of trying. But it does seem like my issue is not fertility as such so I'd prefer some kind of RPL panel. How unethical would it be to claim to have had 2 CPs instead of the one? Some doctor's might count that as 3 losses, especially due to my age.

I just know I'll get pregnant this cycle again (luckily the test date would be the day after the doctor's appointment) and that it would end up being an MMC or CP again. Which would likely mean that when I would finally get any tests done I'd be pregnant and ignored and then have to wait again for tests after the MC. Not feeling very optimistic about anything, but at least things are moving forward.

Oh, and my supervisor wants me to do a presentation on my MMC due date in December. That'll be fun.

It‚Äôs much better to experience this having an LC then not bc you really don‚Äôt ever get happy again about a pregnancy so it robs you of that experience in the future. </p>

He might not be able to articulate what part of him was also buried. He might not feel he has permission to mourn especially if he feel like his job is to support you in your grief. Grief is so hard and personal and easily becomes anger.

He might be trying to ""fix"" things by making you ""happy,"" and not realizing (or be emotionally okay with) you not wanting to be ""fixed"" e.g. ""happy"" right now. I don't know if these thoughts are useful, and again, mostly I'm just sorry for the loss of your child.

This gets complicated really fast with really big feelings. I hope you're able to hold each other with love in your grief. I hope you can forgive each other misunderstandings and allow space for each other's pain and love. I hold you all in my heart while I type this.

Good grief counselors really are good guides. Your hospital might have resources and/or your church. If some friend has been asking, what can I do to help, maybe they can do the research and find one for the both of you?

I have roses in my garden. I will bring blooms inside today to remind me of you and your path and hold it sacred in my heart. I will bring one in for you also u/Jwizz313.

The latter is a more detailed book that covers everything including TFMR, perinatal hospice, having a child with disabilities, and what comes after these things.  

Our hospital also connected us with a bereavement counselor who we/I saw monthly (free) for quite a while. And we/I also went regularly to a parent support group for general perinatal loss for months. (The closest one specifically for TFMR is 2 hrs away from us, but you might live closer to one.)  

Grieving and healing takes time. My son also had a ""dark grey"" diagnosis, and I grappled a lot with how to communicate that and our decision when, as you said, things weren't as clear cut as in some diagnoses--rather a jumble of possible trajectories and probabilities.  But we grapple and do the griefwork because we love our babies.  I'm sorry you have a need for this community, but I'm glad you found us.

Not so long out of high school, living with my parents (after returning from a year working overseas), very much in love with the father with plans to get married. He lived overseas, in the country I had worked in, and we had no solid plans for how we were going to be together again - he was resisting moving to my country and I was struggling to qualify for a visa to move back to his. A pregnancy wasn't ideal, and I didn't feel I was in a situation (financially, physically etc) to give a child a good start. I'm 29 now and have not spent a day regretting my decision to terminate. Also, that man who was madly in love with me dumped me a year later for someone twice my age, completely out of the blue. Life happens.

Oddly enough,  I was talking to my mum about it all today. I said to her that if I had decided differently back then, I wouldn't have done such a bad job raising the child and I know I would have had support from my family - but my life would have been SO DIFFERENT. I've crammed a lot into the last 10 years, a lot that might not have been possible with a child. I very very very much doubt I would have even met, let alone married my husband if I'd had that baby. I also doubt I would have had the time and opportunity to get the additional education and experience I needed to start my career (I work with animals, which is very full on - let alone with children! Especially in the beginning stages when you really need to shove your foot in the door and basically have no life outside of work/volunteering to build up the skills and reputation you need).

I think what I'm trying to say is that this decision is serious, and it's bigger than just being about what you want right now. It's about what is best for the child, as well as yourself, in the long term. It's a decision that only you can make, really, and there's **no wrong answer**. If you change your mind and decide to keep the baby, that's ok too. Having a termination now doesn't mean you won't deserve children in the future. I'm very glad I've had the luxury of waiting until now to have children - I have a good marriage, we've been able to buy a property and settle into it, we have the finances to give our child a great start to life. Looking back at my life over the 10 years since that termination, I still think the decision was right not only for me, but also for that child (who I did love, despite everything), my ex, and my present husband.

Just wanted to offer you some perspective from someone who had a termination at a similar age, and how I see it several years later.

There are ""Rules"" for posting.  The sub also has a link to FAQs, and a link to a ""Common Acronyms List"".  On desktop, all of these are on the right hand side bar.  On mobile, there's a nav bar at the bottom of the header, with ""Posts"" and ""About"", and all of this info is under ""About"".  

Guidance about trigger warnings (""TW"") is in Rule #2.  A good number of women here have had losses and have no living children--they've lost not just their babies, but also ""parenthood"" and a certain construct of ""family"".  For this reason, any posts or comments mention living children (""LC""'s) tend to have a TW at the beginning. We have parents here who've experienced infertility, repeat pregnancy loss, or secondary infertility brought on by their loss, and mentions of LC's can be particularly painful for them--TW's are a way to ask for the support you need, while allowing them to steer clear of painful details.   

For similar reasons, the places and ways that one can share information about BFP's and current pregnancies is limited.  (All of this etiquette is shared with subs for e.g. infertility.)  

Titles of posts can't be edited, but to a TW to the main text of a post or comment, go to ""edit"".  This is typically either in a small menu of post options directly underneath the text (desktop) or in a menu that pops up if you click on the ""..."" under the text (mobile).

Read the rules, lurk the sub a little to get a sense of what is posted where (and what is giving other ladies a hard time), and it should be fine.  

LC's or no, a lot of women here have had the same questions, fears and feelings as you: Pregnancy will never be the same. How can I do this again?  Maybe I should try for the family I wanted if it means suffering multiple losses to get there.  This is a great place to connect with other women who understand.  I'm sorry you need to be here--but happy that you found this source of support.

You talk to people here and you know you aren't alone, but when you see people in the flesh, couples that look like you, it's different.

Everyone who spoke was from the hospital, and they also gave us a chance to ""name our babies"" by saying their name, and birthday (which I was confused about) and then they would say ""Mabel, we remember you"" which was very sweet. 

&#x200B;

Finally, we all drove to the grave and they provided roses for us to lay on the plaque and said a few more words. 

&#x200B;

There were people there that were very emotional, and some that were less emotional.   
I found it to be a good moment of closure for my husband and me. 

&#x200B;

We stood in the back and quietly said goodbye to Mabel. We told her that we were sorry we didn't get to meet her, and that we love her. Then in the car ride home we talked about how we are ready to not be sad anymore, being sad is exhausting. We want to be excited for our next pregnancy.

<p>&#x200B;</p>

<p>I enjoyed it, as much as one can enjoy a funeral. It was good closure for my husband and me. </p>

<p>&#x200B;</p>

<p>To start, seeing so many other people who I knew experienced similar situations was comforting. </p>

<p>You talk to people here and you know you aren&#39;t alone, but when you see people in the flesh, couples that look like you, it&#39;s different. </p>

<p>&#x200B;</p>

<p>Everyone who spoke was from the hospital, and they also gave us a chance to &quot;name our babies&quot; by saying their name, and birthday (which I was confused about) and then they would say &quot;Mabel, we remember you&quot; which was very sweet. </p>

<p>&#x200B;</p>

<p>Finally, we all drove to the grave and they provided roses for us to lay on the plaque and said a few more words. </p>

<p>&#x200B;</p>

<p>There were people there that were very emotional, and some that were less emotional.<br/>
I found it to be a good moment of closure for my husband and me. </p>

<p>&#x200B;</p>

<p>We stood in the back and quietly said goodbye to Mabel. We told her that we were sorry we didn&#39;t get to meet her, and that we love her. Then in the car ride home we talked about how we are ready to not be sad anymore, being sad is exhausting. We want to be excited for our next pregnancy. It doesn&#39;t mean we are trying to forget Mabel, but we are moving forward. </p>

<p>&#x200B;</p>

<p>So, overall, I think it was very beneficial to go. </p>

After we got the NIPT results back my husband really wanted to do a cutesy announcement thing but I did not, so I made him wait until I was out of 1st tri and he ended up doing something specifically for his work peeps right at 14 weeks (pic of our dog with an ultrasound photo and some phrase, I don‚Äôt even remember).

Ended up in hospital (first time in an ambulance, first time with a drip, first time in hospital for something serious, first time admitted over night) the next day with severe bleeding and pains. Going three 2/3 pads an hour. Having to have an internal exam and remove any clots by hand. Told I had to stay over night as blood pressure and blod count were very low, and to keep an eye the pain and if any procedures needed done. Next day was discharged with iron tablets and nothing else. Felt empty, lost. 

Bled for three weeks after. One week break. Then period, like my app would say I would be. That whole time I felt like I was surrounded by fog that I couldn't get out. Flashbacks were the worst. 
Three weeks after I felt like I was moving onto a better place, which was hard to accept but I needed! Flashbacks fading.

At the dentist and filled in a form. And the last Questions was ""are you pregnant now? Have you had a baby in the last 12months"". Of all the places I didn't think it'd remind me that I don't have one, or will not be  having one this time. Thanks dentist. Nearly cried in your waiting room. 

Went away on a girls holiday and it all came flodding back because I used it as a milestone. I should have been four and half months. And that was that. It was a week ago today when we went to Centre Parcs. And I'm still not over it. I'm back to being in the fog. Flashbacks are back with a force. Emotional. People just saying your time will come, just wasn't now. You can try again. It was for the best for you. You will move on. Just want to tell them all to shut up. They don't understand. They haven't been through it. It's just empty phrases they using that hold no meaning. They don't understand the feelings and emotions you go through. It's tough trying to explain it to someone, who then still doesn't understand. They don't understand the flashbacks, the sudden relisation that it's not happening, the emptiness, loneliness, wanting a hole to swallow you up, the pit in your stomach, the sleepless nights thinking and thinking what if, just thinking what's the point, crying at random. 
So I keep hushed. Saying I'm fine when I'm crying on the inside. Plastering a smile on my face. I never thought I'd be at this point again in my life.

Sorry for the long post. Just feel like on here you all understand so I can be so open about it all! Thank you all for being an amazing support.

Griefwork and healing is even harder to do when you can't be 100% selfish with your time and space, but have other children you have to maintain some normalcy and stability for.

I can only imagine how terrifying it would be to have such a tragic outcome due to medical negligence. 
However, I too am a mother of a lost baby. Also had to have emergency c section (not due to uterine rupture but extremely early preeclampsia and cord blood reversal). At 24.4w. 
Sweet baby boy was barely 14oz  at birth.  He made it for a month and two days but unfortunately suffered some severe complications and died quite quickly.. 
The loss is just... Inexplicable to anyone who has not gone through it.. know you're not alone in this pain.. 

And your yearning to be pregnant again as soon as possible is understandable. I find myself missing feeling life inside me and gently tracing my c section scar to remind me of the fact that I am a mother, despite my child not being present.. 
However, I too was told to wait a year before trying to conceive. 
The doctors had to perform a classical vertical incision on my uterus (instead of the more modern horizontal incision) which leaves me with no chance of ever attempting VBAC and means I can only deliver any subsequent babies through c section. 
It also leaves me at high risk of rupture the longer I carry to term, meaning doctors will want me to deliver them earlier than full term, preferably as soon as 34wks. 

I know you don't want to hear it and a year right now seems like an eternity you'll never be able to get through.. but please PLEASE wait a year. At least. 
C section alone is one thing. But healing after a uterine rupture is a much larger amount of healing that needs to be done due to your risk of it happening again and the threat it poses to both the babys life and YOURS. It is imperative you let your body heal all the way. 
And stress from grief will affect the speed of your recovery. 

You WILL be considered a high risk patient for all subsequent pregnancies you may have, that is pretty much a guarantee. 

My mother in law is a midwife of 15+yrs and has explained it quite thoroughly how important it is to wait the suggested amount of time. 

So.. please try and wait those extra couple months.. and definitely talk about it with your OBGyn.

I basically thought well, I am too chicken to off myself, but if I died somehow that would just be dandy and end my suffering. This was a thought that remained for about 2 months after the TFMR. I felt that I decided after that since I was going to be alive nothing was going to save me with the easy and painless way out and I would have to suffer this out. Which is what they say of going through the pain not around it. 

We went to a baby loss grief counselor because we were fighting so bad and I was so angry about everything and it was really a low point and we were both really unhappy because day to day was just SAD. The counselor kind of looked at us and said.... I haven't seen a couple in your place who has gone through this that wasn't this way. In a very ABNORMAL situation this (and our behavior and reaction etc ) was the only thing that WAS normal. It's normal for you to feel extremely sad after a loss, to not know how to cope, to feel lost, to feel that there is no hope etc. On top of the fact that I really think the hormones and the surge of hormones of post partum depression is what we really suffer with this - on top of the fact that WE HAVE NO BABY. There are women that feel so bad with post partum depression that they become suicidal and they have babies to hold. So this said to me that hey, maybe this is even more compounded by hormonal changes after all this. My milk came in. My periods are not normal now. Shit is still wrong - so why should I feel ""normal"" - nope, not happening. 

As far as marriage being back - what counselors and baby loss support group said was that it never actually goes back. After sitting in a room with 30 ladies who lost their babies due to stillbirth, uterine ruptrure, terminations for medical reasons, anywhere from 1 mo ago to 15 years ago AND ALL OF THEM, ALL OF THEM bawled their eyes out when it came their turn to talk about their lost baby. ALL OF THEM. Ladies 15 years out bawled just as much as the one that lost 1 months ago. This really put it in perspective for me that I will NOT get ""over this"". This is just something thats SUCH A HARD awful thing to carry and this is life. This is a part of MY life now. I didn't want this part, I didn't want that at all. I wish I could take it back and never experience it. But alas, this is what we have. We can't change what happened no matter what we say AND BARGAINING if normal experience of grief. ""If I took more vitamins, if I did x y z, if I went in earlier, if I bla bla bla."" Yes, the what if game - that doesn't CHANGE ANYTHING. But some how we still love to play. 
What if game 1 :: me 0  Well played, what if game. 

So what I learned from attending the loss group and grief counseling for baby loss is that you are the same but different, and nothing will really ever be the same and you have to figure out who you are and who you will be again as a person and as a couple. Also, the counselor gave my husband 3 years. She said, you are signing up for this for 3 years - to feel these things and the recovery, the feelings are extremely strong for those first 3 years. As we were 3 months out from the loss, it was now conceivable that ""where it was"" is not going to ever be that same place. It has to be a new place that understands the pain we have endured and that we now just have to keep waking up and doing something. We may never have a child, we don't know what the complications did and we know he has an issue and I now may too. We have no clue. But the day I went to that baby loss group, I realized what I was trying to do was go back to feeling how I did before the loss. I was fighting to really get the feeling of innocence and win against the WHAT IF GAME. And there is no winning. 

Going there helped me understand that I have lost that game. And I can not return to who I was before. And I have to move forward knowing that.

I completely understand that feeling. After my 3 mc all I wanted was to try again and there would be no healing. When the 4th time ended in anencephaly termination I understood I needed to wait and try to figure it out as much as I hated the idea of it. With your situation it's completely different. Uterine rupture is very serious and is not like a regular C -section. They do not even recommend people get pregnant after a c-section less than a year, but if you do not wait the likelyhood of the uterus not being strong enough again and another baby loss is TOO high. I know that 3 months seems like it would be helpful to you but what would be even worse if that 3 months wait resulted in another horrifying situation and you would not forgive yourself the outcome I promise. Uterine ruptures is another different kind of a horrible outcome and I am surprised they even told you 1 year which seems low for that kind of complication. 

With that being said, I know you do not get better from this. That pain of going through this loss, it will always be with you. The waves will come on just as strong but they will be further apart, the waves. I met a girl in your exact situation. After 10 years of infertility and all their money spent on IVF, she had a uterine rupture and the baby died and she's benchmarked and they have no more funds. It's a fucking horrifying, awful situation on top of any loss and I am horrified for you. I am also wanting to not suffer anymore than I have and giving the best chance possible. You are stronger than you think you are. You can do this. 1 year feels like a long ass time.  It has been 3 months since we lost our baby and it has felt like forever. But I do know waiting and trying to either get better/ get more information/ figure out what the hell to do is the right thing for us. I can only give you encouragement in trying REALLY hard to do things you may enjoy in the following year and pretend that this is your last year to be without schedule etc. I don't know if we will ever get a chance to have a baby but this thought has been helpful to me to at least try to make some sort of sanity time in the mean time while we are not trying and waiting. I am so sorry for your loss and it's SOOOO extremely difficult to deal with. It puts huge strain on marriages, finances, work, friendships,  mental health and pretty much everything, I am so sorry again and I am in pain with you.

My hunch is that the year-long wait is due to the emergency c-section. A year is on the generous side as well, because many practitioners recommend 18 months, instead. My own practice recommends waiting 12 months to conceive after c-section, unless there were risks, then it's 18 months. If you get pregnant in a shorter time-frame, you cannot attempt to VBAC and are considered high risk, carefully monitored, and usually have to have a c-section on the early side, closer to 37 weeks.

The risk of uterine rupture increases with conception too soon after a c-section. I would talk more to your doctor about what the risks are for you personally.

I try to say something unrelated that makes them feel as if I answered, like &quot;We&#39;re pretty smitten with her.&quot; But the dunces just ask again, like they think I didn&#39;t hear. When I&#39;m feeling fed up I say, &quot;Something like that!&quot; and change the subject. Only one man&#39;s had the gumption to ask what I meant, and he was actually sympathetic when I answered.</p>
