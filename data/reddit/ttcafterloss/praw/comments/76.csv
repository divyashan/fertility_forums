Hi there, I‚Äôm so sorry for your losses.  I had my entire left tube removed last November due to an ectopic pregnancy (my very first pregnancy), and I know that it‚Äôs really hard to have open questions about your future fertility.  I had a requisite 3-month wait as I also had a couple doses of methotrexate which didn‚Äôt work, so I didn‚Äôt start trying again until February.  At my annual checkup in March, my doctor reassured me that I could still conceive with one tube, and we made a plan that if I hadn‚Äôt conceived in 6 months, I‚Äôd go for further testing.  

Well, it turns out I didn‚Äôt need that, as I conceived right after my appointment‚Äî so it took me two cycles of trying to conceive again.  I used temping and OPKs so that we could better predict timing.  I feel so fortunate to have had that happen, and I‚Äôm currently just over 10 weeks along.  I‚Äôm still cautiously optimistic as it‚Äôs early, but things seem to be progressing along nicely.  One bonus (if there is any!) of having had an ectopic is that as soon as you get a positive test, you should call and get your hcg drawn, as you do have a higher likelihood of another ectopic (correlation, not causation, because whatever caused your first ectopic could cause another).

This is such a difficult time and nothing in the world feels the same anymore.  I know it‚Äôs cliche to say ‚Äúbe kind to yourself‚Äù and ‚Äúgive yourself space‚Äù or ‚Äúallow yourself to feel‚Äù.  These are all true, I‚Äôm not saying the advice is bad!  But if you are feeling lost, I can list more specific things that helped me.

I had a very similar situation in 2016 - delivered healthy BG twins at 22 weeks, they both lived for about an hour after delivery.  And my experience at the beginning was the same as yours - painful reminders all over the house, sometimes relieved to talk to my friends and family and sometimes uncontrollably angry or guilty or sad.  

I know your wife has to heal physically, but I recommend going away when she‚Äôs ready.  It doesn‚Äôt have to be far or expensive but having physical distance from all the painful reminders may be helpful.  We went away 6 weeks after their birth, just for a week and I still cried every day but there were moments when I wasn‚Äôt consumed by the grief - I had my toes in sand and an umbrella drink and for a few minutes I wasn‚Äôt just ‚Äúa mom without my babies‚Äù.  It was a mental and emotional relief and I think you need those moments to feel something else and that‚Äôs hard to do when you are surrounded by your regular life.  

Everyone deals with grief differently, so I can‚Äôt give you any secret formula.  I personally went to therapy - I preferred one to one, I didn‚Äôt love the support group in my area, but that wasn‚Äôt their fault.  It was that I was so consumed with my own grief I couldn‚Äôt process others as well.  But some people really find comfort in the group environment.  

I also think it‚Äôs hard for the non-pregnant partner.  Everyone focuses on the mom and really, it‚Äôs your loss too.  My husband had a hard time but everyone expected him to just support me and be strong and recover quicker, and really he was mourning as well and needed comfort and attention.   He hated the feeling of being helpless, and I think we were too afraid to trigger each other.  We tried to protect each other by hiding our pain when we should have shared more and allowed the other one into our pain.  

This grief is all consuming at first.  You don‚Äôt have to fight it all at once or ‚Äúbe better‚Äù by any time or deadline.  And I know the desperate feeling of wanting closure but for me, it‚Äôs three years later and I don‚Äôt have full closure.   I miss them everyday.  Sure, I function better and I‚Äôm not incapacitated by the grief, but I‚Äôm typing with tears because it‚Äôs dam hard to lose your kids.  

I read it somewhere in this sub, but welcome to the shittiest club with the best people.  We are here for you.",[],,t1_eolnucu,False,0,[],False,"<div class=""md""><p>I am so so sorry for your loss.  This is such a difficult time and nothing in the world feels the same anymore.  I know it‚Äôs cliche to say ‚Äúbe kind to yourself‚Äù and ‚Äúgive yourself space‚Äù or ‚Äúallow yourself to feel‚Äù.  These are all true, I‚Äôm not saying the advice is bad!  But if you are feeling lost, I can list more specific things that helped me.</p>

<p>I had a very similar situation in 2016 - delivered healthy BG twins at 22 weeks, they both lived for about an hour after delivery.  And my experience at the beginning was the same as yours - painful reminders all over the house, sometimes relieved to talk to my friends and family and sometimes uncontrollably angry or guilty or sad.  </p>

<p>I know your wife has to heal physically, but I recommend going away when she‚Äôs ready.  It doesn‚Äôt have to be far or expensive but having physical distance from all the painful reminders may be helpful.  We went away 6 weeks after their birth, just for a week and I still cried every day but there were moments when I wasn‚Äôt consumed by the grief - I had my toes in sand and an umbrella drink and for a few minutes I wasn‚Äôt just ‚Äúa mom without my babies‚Äù.  It was a mental and emotional relief and I think you need those moments to feel something else and that‚Äôs hard to do when you are surrounded by your regular life.  </p>

<p>Everyone deals with grief differently, so I can‚Äôt give you any secret formula.  I personally went to therapy - I preferred one to one, I didn‚Äôt love the support group in my area, but that wasn‚Äôt their fault.  It was that I was so consumed with my own grief I couldn‚Äôt process others as well.  But some people really find comfort in the group environment.  </p>

<p>I also think it‚Äôs hard for the non-pregnant partner.  Everyone focuses on the mom and really, it‚Äôs your loss too.  My husband had a hard time but everyone expected him to just support me and be strong and recover quicker, and really he was mourning as well and needed comfort and attention.   He hated the feeling of being helpless, and I think we were too afraid to trigger each other.  We tried to protect each other by hiding our pain when we should have shared more and allowed the other one into our pain.  </p>

<p>This grief is all consuming at first.  You don‚Äôt have to fight it all at once or ‚Äúbe better‚Äù by any time or deadline.  And I know the desperate feeling of wanting closure but for me, it‚Äôs three years later and I don‚Äôt have full closure.   I miss them everyday.  Sure, I function better and I‚Äôm not incapacitated by the grief, but I‚Äôm typing with tears because it‚Äôs dam hard to lose your kids.  </p>

‚Äúas for grief, you'll find it comes in waves. When the ship is first wrecked, you're drowning, with wreckage all around you. Everything floating around you reminds you of the beauty and the magnificence of the ship that was, and is no more. And all you can do is float. You find some piece of the wreckage and you hang on for a while. Maybe it's some physical thing. Maybe it's a happy memory or a photograph. Maybe it's a person who is also floating. For a while, all you can do is float. Stay alive.

In the beginning, the waves are 100 feet tall and crash over you without mercy. They come 10 seconds apart and don't even give you time to catch your breath. All you can do is hang on and float. After a while, maybe weeks, maybe months, you'll find the waves are still 100 feet tall, but they come further apart. When they come, they still crash all over you and wipe you out. But in between, you can breathe, you can function. You never know what's going to trigger the grief. It might be a song, a picture, a street intersection, the smell of a cup of coffee. It can be just about anything...and the wave comes crashing. But in between waves, there is life.

Somewhere down the line, and it's different for everybody, you find that the waves are only 80 feet tall. Or 50 feet tall. And while they still come, they come further apart. You can see them coming. An anniversary, a birthday, or Christmas, or landing at O'Hare. You can see it coming, for the most part, and prepare yourself. And when it washes over you, you know that somehow you will, again, come out the other side. Soaking wet, sputtering, still hanging on to some tiny piece of the wreckage, but you'll come out. Take it from an old guy. The waves never stop coming, and somehow you don't really want them to. But you learn that you'll survive them. And other waves will come. And you'll survive them too. If you're lucky, you'll have lots of scars from lots of loves. And lots of shipwrecks. ‚Äú",[],,t1_eoknjho,False,0,[],False,"<div class=""md""><p>I am so sorry, and thank you for sharing.

I (thank goodness? I'm not sure) passed the majority of things on Monday night at home.  It was painful, but not as bad as I was expecting.  My bleeding seems a bit lighter today, I'm hoping it doesn't last much longer.  DH and I stayed busy Tuesday (he was off for PTO already luckily), yesterday I worked and stayed busy.  I got some great support at work yesterday which was nice, because I'm relatively new there.  Today I'm off and by myself.  We'll see how I do on my own.  DH is having a really hard time.  He's not super expressive with emotions, but I can tell.  He got so attached after hearing the heartbeat.  I think that's the part upsetting me the most - seeing how much this has crushed him.  And he's trying to put on a brave face for me.  He told his mom on Tuesday, we found out for the first time she had a miscarriage way back when.  I'm going to tell my mom today.

I know this is normal, but I'm experiencing ALL the emotions.  Sadness, anger, disbelief.  I'm kind of upset that my regular OB hasn't called me to check in.

I&#39;m not sure) passed the majority of things on Monday night at home.  It was painful, but not as bad as I was expecting.  My bleeding seems a bit lighter today, I&#39;m hoping it doesn&#39;t last much longer.  DH and I stayed busy Tuesday (he was off for PTO already luckily), yesterday I worked and stayed busy.  I got some great support at work yesterday which was nice, because I&#39;m relatively new there.  Today I&#39;m off and by myself.  We&#39;ll see how I do on my own.  DH is having a really hard time.  He&#39;s not super expressive with emotions, but I can tell.  He got so attached after hearing the heartbeat.  I think that&#39;s the part upsetting me the most - seeing how much this has crushed him.  And he&#39;s trying to put on a brave face for me.  He told his mom on Tuesday, we found out for the first time she had a miscarriage way back when.  I&#39;m going to tell my mom today.</p>

I am sorry about the darkness. I definitely felt that more the second time. Miscarriage isn&#39;t easy no matter what. Miscarriage is common but none the less shocking.</p>

It just reinforced the idea that my body is taking care of things and needs time to completely reset. 

As for ovulating, theres no way to know. Some people bounce back right away and ovulate 2 weeks later just like they would if it had been a normal period. Some dont. I took an LH test yesterday and it was positive... I'm not temping so I obviously cant confirm anything but that would mean it took me 4 weeks after bleeding started when it normally is right around 2. Its all pretty weird. 

I guess the TL;DR is that theres no good answer to your questions but as long as you're not feverish or in major pain, you're on track to eventually return back to normal.

I am so so sorry for your loss, and I‚Äôm so sorry you have to dealing with a world run by decision makers who would never have the strength to be in your shoes. 

I assume you are in the US (I am as well) and I have worried about this exact thing. A coworker of my husband‚Äôs miscarried around 20 weeks right after they found out their baby had a fatal chromosomal abnormality, and she has been very vocal about the brief period where they were considering their choices before she miscarried. To have choice taken away is a scary thing.

Depending on where you are located you will likely have different options. I would first, be very open with your doctor. Hopefully the same one who has been with you and knows your history. Talk to them directly about your options (maybe even before you TTC again) and be blunt about what might happen. If you are in an area affected by this new legislation, consider talking to supportive family if (worst case scenario) you had a similar chromosomal issue, and see what other doctors/clinics might take you. Also consider calling a place like Planned Parenthood, just in case. They will likely know the most and can help you get to where you need to be (again, in a worst case scenario!)

I would also say try not to let the 1% scare you. I can‚Äôt imagine the loss you‚Äôve experienced, but those odds are VERY low. Everything right now is scary, but this is what I‚Äôm trying to do. When we conceive again I will be very blunt with my doctor (I am also lucky to live in a very progressive area right now so I‚Äôm still okay.)

And outside of that, be vocal. If you have the energy and the strength, share your story. Many, many, many people feel the way they do about things like abort!on because they really just don‚Äôt get it. And of course support legislation and representatives that actually care about women‚Äôs rights. Every little bit counts. (And please don‚Äôt feel pressured to tell your story, that is a very personal thing and should 100% be your decision.

Getting the sonogram done is kind of a pain in the ass because they can only do it days 7-10 of your cycle, and you can't schedule it until your period starts, so if you have a clinic that is busy, it can be difficult to make the appointment. 

For me, the mental burden of going through that process of pregnancy and miscarriage is far worse than waiting and running tests. If you can get it all done in a month, it might be worth doing it? I just don't think one month is that long in the grand scheme of things.

How far along were your pregnancies when you miscarried? Have you done any testing at all that might indicate the cause? How traumatic was the miscarriage experience for you?

Personally, I am getting whatever testing done that I can because I don't want another miscarriage if I can avoid it. I was diagnosed in February with hashimoto's after my second miscarriage.

It's possible that my miscarriages weren't caused by hashimoto's, but I'm not getting pregnant again until my numbers are normal because I don't want another miscarriage. 

For me, the hardest part is when you get a positive pregnancy test, you have to wait to go see a doctor. Then you do an ultrasound and something is off. So you wait another week and do another ultrasound. Bad news again. So you schedule your D&C and then you wait for that. After your D&C, you wait a few weeks for your follow up appointment. And then you wait for your period to come back.

I found out I was pregnant for the second time on February 12. It has been almost 14 weeks since then.

<p>I think you should call your doctor and let them know and schedule an appointment. Menstrual changes with that weird sensation are worth checking out regardless.</p>

<p>I am so sorry. After trying for 18 months, I bet this was very upsetting.</p>

<p>Edit: I&#39;m so sad about the angry response to this post. We are better than this. We don&#39;t have to put other people down to grieve for ourselves. If this is how ttcafterloss is going to be, I don&#39;t want to be a part of it. This place is supposed to be supportive and safe. Not bitter and unnecessarily rude to genuine posters.</p>

&#x200B;

To answer PP, a TI cycle is different than an OPK cycle because you're usually on stimulating drugs like clomid or letrozole (or even injectables) to either improve egg quality or to slightly overstimulate. I normally ovulate, but I'm on letrozole to release 2 or 3 eggs at a time to increase our odds that one fertilizes. Also, a TI cycle usually involves bloodwork and ultrasound monitoring throughout to pinpoint ovulation exactly and to know how big follicles are, etc. Some people also do a trigger shot just like an IUI, and then have sex. And the nicest part of TI vs IUI? A lot of a TI cycle can be done under normal insurance, whereas an IUI requires fertility coverage.",[],,t1_eo882xw,False,0,[],False,"<div class=""md""><p>my first IUI was changed to TI after schedule issues and it was successful, but ended in our T13 loss. we are now on the 3rd TI cycle.

The magic is gone for me. The miracle is gone. If a miracle was going to happen, it would have happened. At this point, it is a test of science against entropy. 

I am out of empathy for myself... I swear to god it feels like I've either had cancer or a miscarriage every other week for nearly a decade. Last October, when they found some concerning tumors in my hip, less than 4 weeks before IVF#1, I told the doctor, ""Biopsy me or shut up."" When IVF#1 gave me a positive home pregnancy test at 6DP5DT, I experienced about 2 minutes of mild happiness. Then, it was back to being clinical. 

It is about hoops for me. The prize at the end is going to be a take-home baby, but I don't know that I'll ever experience the magic again. I have journals of the first couple pregnancies where I really felt the magic, and then the most incredibly sad entries when they ended in losses. Now all the entries are like, ""7W6D Still pregnant today. 9W4D Still pregnant today. 11W2D Not pregnant anymore."" I just jump through hoops like a trained monkey. Hoop 1 is a positive home pregnancy test. Hoop 2 is beta confirmation. Hoop 3 is doubling betas. Hoop 4 is doubling betas again. Hoop 5 is confirmation of a fetal pole and gestational sac. Hoop 6 is a heart beat. Hoop 7 is good size. It just goes like that-- until we get past the genetic testing, until we get where? Does it stop feeling like jumping through hoops when we make it farther than we ever made it before? Does it start to feel magical when we are certain the baby could survive outside the womb? Does the magic come back the first time we hear our baby cry? Does it come back when we spend our first night in our home as a family of three? Does it ever come back? Do I ever get to feel the wonder and awe of making a new person, or does it always feel like I'm jumping through circus hoops trying to get another peanut?

I have little boxes for each pregnancy... where I saved the things from that pregnancy. The first one only has a journal and a onesie I made to tell my husband. The second has a journal and all the pregnancy tests. The third has a journal, the pregnancy test, and the ultrasound photos. The fourth has a lot of photos since it was IVF-- we got pictures of the embryo before she was transferred. We also got a lot of ultrasounds, so we have tons of pictures. For some reason, having these little keepsake boxes-- those are the only things in this world to mark that for a brief time, a potential person existed. They bring me comfort. It actually made me really sad when I made the first box and the only proof was a journal and onesie. I didn't keep the pregnancy tests because I never expected the pregnancy to end before we got our 12w ultrasound. 

Our friends and family will forget that 5 little people almost existed. Even my husband sometimes has to think to recall the number of losses we've had. I feel almost like I need the early monitoring so that I can keep a remembrance of what could have been because everyone else on the planet will forget.

<p>I am out of empathy for myself... I swear to god it feels like I&#39;ve either had cancer or a miscarriage every other week for nearly a decade. Last October, when they found some concerning tumors in my hip, less than 4 weeks before IVF#1, I told the doctor, &quot;Biopsy me or shut up.&quot; When IVF#1 gave me a positive home pregnancy test at 6DP5DT, I experienced about 2 minutes of mild happiness.

Bleeding like a regular period days 1 and 2, only the blood was very dark almost black. Day 3 fucking sucked. Trigger warning for the next paragraph. I would skip past it if you'd be sensitive to specific details and the emotional side of things.

Day 3 I had heavy cramps that felt like early labor contractions. I was passing massive clots the size of oranges with tons of blood in between. It was equal parts disgusting and scary, and I was sobbing the entire time because every time another clot came out was another sick reminder that I lost my very very wanted baby girl.

A little over a month later my period returned. I'm on my second cycle post-loss right now and I'm 99% sure I'm ovulating right now, so it didn't take long for things to get back to normal-ish.

Not with IVF. It depends on how many people know you‚Äôre in treatment or what stage of treatment you‚Äôre in. Obviously, your husband will know what‚Äôs going on every step of the way.

You may or may not gain weight (or even lose weight) in the first trimester due to eating struggles and both are ok. </p>

<p>Once pregnancy is over, you also have to remember to give yourself time to recover and slowly get your body back to your new normal. Sounds like you could have a hard time being patient with the process but maybe that can be used as a positive motivation to get back in shape. It&#39;ll work out. You can do this!</p>

I wish I was better prepared mentally, kudos to you for posting here to find out what to expect.
We were told on 8 week ultrasound no heartbeat and no growth so baby was about 7 weeks.
I had mild cramps for about 3 days, spotting intensified into bleeding and then it got so much worse. I wish I had known ahead of time! I was glad I asked my husband to stay home with me because I was afraid I might faint because of the bloodloss and pain. So if you can make sure someone is around on the day your cramps get more intense, just in case. At some point I was so weak from the pain I couldn't speak so I would not have been able to call anyone to help.
It felt more like real contractions and not just period cramps. I wish I had taken a painkiller straight away!!! It might have made things easier. It lasted about two hours and then the pain slowly subsided.

Also I did not expect to actually see the placenta and the embryo (TMI) it all fell in the toilet bowl because at that point I was so weak and bleedinog so much I just sat on the toilet for about 20 minutes. It was weird to see it, but helped me realize it's really over. My brain has completely blurred my memory of that moment though.

Once everything was evacuated from my body I felt instant relief and the pain was completely gone. The bleeding slowed down as well gradually.
If you bleed a lot you can buy some iron supplements to help you not feel exhausted from the blood loss, but I'd check with a doctor first.

Also, take it easy for at least a day afterwards. It's a lot for the body and the mind and the heart. Take good care of yourself.

tl;dr - don't stay on your own in case you faint; have some painkillers within reach; take iron afterwards if you lose lots of blood; self-care and rest!",[],,t1_enlgm4s,False,0,[],False,"<div class=""md""><p>Like most commenters mentioned, it&#39;s different for everyone.

There is no way in the world I can trust God to take care of this unborn baby now. I mean He didn't take care of the other 3 so why should I trust Him with this one?

As Christians, we took comfort in the fact that he was in a better place (Heaven) with no more pain and generally better life than the one here on earth. The night of his funeral, I found out I was pregnant after struggling to conceive with my husband during my dad‚Äôs cancer battle. It was so bittersweet! I felt like it was a sign from God that everything would be ok. We had lost my dad and gained a child. The circle of life continued. 

Then at our first appointment, gut punch. Baby had passed away too. I waited 8 more grueling weeks for my body to miscarry naturally, then experienced a very traumatic miscarriage. My faith wavered. How could God put me through all of that? We were so blessed to conceive again three months later‚Äîour beautiful rainbow. I thought, we had been through the worst (little did I know) and surely we would be blessed now with a peaceful life and angelic perfect child. 

My labor ended up being prolonged with complications and very traumatic. My postpartum was also traumatic, full of complications. My baby felt like the spawn of satan sometimes (I love him DEARLY now but it was a journey of acceptance and adjustments) with health related complications, reflux and colic for over a year, and a personality that had me googling often: ‚ÄúWhy does my baby hate life?‚Äù I felt like I was being mocked by God. My dad was gone, my first baby was gone, and the one we were so blessed to have was miserable. 

I think that‚Äôs when my faith fell apart. I couldn‚Äôt even attend church because my baby‚Äôs issues made me feel like an outsider and an inconvenience to the rest of the members. (We has moved away from my home church, who probably would have helped us more.) I tried a few different ones and just felt so out of place, I stopped going. 

More recently, my husband‚Äôs very sweet grandmother passed away. We knew it was coming. She was in her 90s and feeling ready to go soon. As ok as you can be with losing a loved one, I was. The week she passed away, again, we found out we were pregnant. And again, we lost it. Geeze Louise. Must they always come in doubles?

A few months after, we conceived again. This time I really thought we were in the clear. How many times can this happen this way? I prayed and praised, thinking this would be another successful pregnancy, and I had the wisdom to know that even a baby with a rough start can grow into a happy, healthy kiddo. But yet again, gut punch at the first appointment. Three more weeks spent waiting for natural miscarriage. 

And my faith is basically gone. People say, God doesn‚Äôt make mistakes. Except he does. Or nature does. Or the powers-that-be do. Mistakes happen ALL THE TIME. Babies are conceived that literally cannot survive in our world and die a painful death moments after being born. How is that just? How is that comforting? How is there a PURPOSE in that? It‚Äôs become difficult for me to believe in an almighty power that has the supposed ability to stop things like that from occurring and yet continues to let them happen. And for what? A purpose? A lesson? Man‚Äôs free will? It‚Äôs hard to believe that an innocent must suffer so greatly for the mere possibility of a purpose/lesson/allowance for Man‚Äôs will.

Although I share the other comment's opinion about sex being more than intercourse, I think the key element here is you struggling over your the image you have of yourself. I doubt you will enjoy your sexual life until you enjoy your sexuality first.


Unfortunately, I understand the feelings that come after a loss. The self-questioning, the doubt, the feeling of your body betraying you, the feeling of being faulty, broken.


However, we are not broken. You want to fight to hold your future kid in your arms while still grieving. That takes tremendous courage and incredible strength. We aren't victims, we are warriors.


You need to remember how powerful you are and how beautiful is your courage. I would recommend for you to try burlesque. The classes are small and full of women who have fun feeling beautiful and fearless. It doesn't matter how you think your body looks. We went to see our friend perform and one of the best girls was obese. Honestly? Nobody could have cared less. She was a fireball of self-steem and the way she smiled while enjoying herself dancing made me feel proud of being a woman. Most girls do even perform in public. Your age, your body, your skills.... Nothing of that matters when you are just having fun feeling like a sexy Valkyrie.


If you can't or don't want to give it a try, you can always buy some sexy lingerie. That's what works best for me. It doesn't matter how shitty my day was or how ugly I feel that day... If I put on my sexy underwear, I feel like a goddess ready to conquer the world :) 


Once you are proud your sexuality, once you have rescued your self-esteem, I would start with masturbation to remember the physical pleasure of sex. Our bodies are not the enemy, they are our allies and they are able to give us incredible amounts of pleasure. They are on our side just trying to do their best.


Maybe you can start cuddling with your partner and try to masturbate alone and then start mixing both of them together over time, transitioning into your regular sex life.

I'm sure your doctor would have mentioned it to you if there was something you can do, or if it was a problem, but you could always make an appointment with her to ask again. I personally think anything you can do to alleviate anxiety is worth the effort. 


I'm also waiting to ovulate again - gaaaa. No one ever talks about how long it can take for your body to regulate itself. It's a rollercoaster, for sure.

 
So far, all my tests have come back normal, too. I think we might just be that small group of people who have back-to-back losses before a successful birth.

We tried for ages... 14 months to be exact and we got pregnant with our first iui which was shocking. At 7+1 we went in and it was measuring at 6 weeks with a heartbeat so faint it couldn't be measured. A week later it was 6+5 and a heartbeat in the 90s. The RE basically called it right then but gave us a week to consider options. A week later, we decided to go with miso for three reasons: A. Cost B. I'm stupidly scared of surgery and C. there are very low chances of complications like ashermans syndrome from the surgery and, since we are already struggling, I didnt want to add to our list of problems. Cost was really the biggest thing but only because we needed infertility treatments to get pregnant. If that wasnt a factor, my decision mightve been different. Regardless, a week later the heartbeat had stopped. As devastating as that was, it was what I personally needed to hear to accept medical interventions. The time between realizing it was not viable and finding out it was over was actually terrible and I'm so sorry you're dealing with that now. 

Miso was not as bad as many stories online said it would be. It wasnt pleasant... but it was manageable. It honestly felt like the flu. I can definitely see how passing the tissue would be traumatic though. It happened so quick for me that I was really too shocked to stop and think about it. What I saw didnt look like anything... I think I was lucky because most of the tissue came out in one go which helped it look like nothing. I remember it clearly but I also remember feeling unbelievably calm bc that moment was as close to closure as I'll ever get. After that I felt almost instantaneously better both physically and emotionally. Bad feelings came and went for a week but, again, it was manageable. It's been two weeks and I feel back to normal... relatively speaking. 

Anecdotally, out of my friend group, three of us have had miscarriages. The one that was natural was further along and struggled with seeing everything but she now describes it similarly to me... closure.

I'm sorry you're struggling so much. I agree with the other poster that, at least when it comes to infection worries, you're probably ok. You've had a good scan showing it was complete and you dont have the classic signs of any complications. I took miso for mine a few weeks ago so my story and experience is different... but I got the same care sheet from my RE that she would've given someone having a natural MC. If I was in bad enough pain or having an out of control fever I was to go straight to the ER. If you get to the point where you feel persistent pain or have a high fever and it is freaking you out, you dont have to wait for your Dr's permission to seek treatment...

I'm sure you already know your options if you want or feel you need help processing all of this. It is not easy and you dont have to do it alone. My RE has mental health info for local psychs and therapist. Theres even support groups in nearby major cities for people who have gone through a MC and just need to talk it out. I've personally considered speaking to a therapist because the week before and after was a bit of a rollercoaster for me emotionally... as is expected... but I'm ok now. It made me feel better knowing I had options though. Have you asked your doctor for recommendations of people you could talk to? If they're dismissive or unhelpful in helping you... knowing what you've been through.... it may be time for a new doctor. 

I personally decided to just write my thoughts out. I am not a journal person and I do feel a bit stupid for having a notebook dedicated to all of my overly emotional thoughts on this topic BUT just being able to put them out of my head has helped. Plus I can full on rage like my 13 year old angsty teen self and absolutely no one has to know about it and that's pretty nice. 

Anyways, you need to take a second to figure out what you need and, if you cant, you may need outside help and theres nothing wrong with that. You have to do whatever it takes to make sure you're ok. If anyone is dismissive of your need to do that, get away from them and find someone who will.

I had a similar experience to one of other commenters, where my pregnancy that ended in MMC was a major rollercoaster.

Then, a week later, we had our first ""real"" prenatal appointment, and the pregnancy measured 8+2 with no heartbeat. We were gutted.

Like you, I wanted to just get things over with, so I elected to a have a D&C. We tried to have it done in my OB's office with just a local anesthetic and some Xanax, but, with the way my cervix is positioned and the shape of my uterus (bicornuate), they couldn't feed the catheter up to where the pregnancy was easily, and I ended up having to go to the hospital to have it done under general anesthesia. Aside from the false start, the procedure went super smoothly, I had zero cramping afterwards and only some light spotting for a few days. I hope I never have to make the decision again, but I'd definitely opt for a D&C in the future if necessary.

I also had a c-section with my first, but, given the way they do D&Cs, I don't think there's really any way for them to check on any potential internal scarring during the procedure unless they were to thread a very tiny camera up through your cervix.

A missed miscarriage means that your body has not recognised that the foetus has died or that the pregnancy is not progressing. With a missed miscarriage you won‚Äôt have cramps and bleeding as you would with a classic miscarriage. Therefore a missed miscarriage is normally discovered at a routine ultrasound scan. The scan will discover that a miscarriage has occurred, sometimes a number of weeks prior - but the body has not expelled the contents of the womb. Sometimes you will go on to then miscarry naturally - which is why doctors sometimes suggest you wait two weeks before undergoing surgical treatment, but other times women will need to have an operation to remove the contents of the womb.

That‚Äôs the medical explanation but the human side of missed miscarriage for all of us who have experienced loss is that it means you can never be confident everything is okay In early pregnancy. Even if you‚Äôve had no symptoms and feel pregnant, until you have a scan, there‚Äôs always a small risk of missed miscarriage. Which is a head fuck.

I had a similar experience - spotting around six weeks, went in and the baby was measuring 5 weeks 3 days, heartbeat 93. Went back a week later fearing the worst and everything looked great (heartbeat 139, measuring on track) - thought we were in the clear. At a follow up ultrasound at 9 weeks we found out the baby had died. Just got the chromosomal analysis back and found out she had Turner syndrome :(. I wanted to give you my whole story because at the time I totally thought (as did the doctor) that all would be well after that good heartbeat and was completely unprepared to find out the heartbeat stopped at 9 weeks in early March.

As far as what to do, I have no good advice so I'll just share my experience (which is only one data point, of course). My body showed no signs of miscarrying after the spotting, and at 9 weeks my doctor didn't feel comfortable having me go the medication route (baby was measuring on track at that point). I had a d&c one week after that final ultrasound, when I was 10 weeks.

I wish I could say the recovery has been smooth, but it has not. I had a bad reaction to general anesthesia for the first few days (it gave me very low blood pressure). Then a week later I started having heavy bouts of bleeding, which kept starting and stopping and at one point sent me to the ER. Long story short, I ended up having 2 cm of retained tissue attached to the back of my uterus, plus a lot of debris left behind, and needed a repeat d&c one month after my first surgery. That was over 3 weeks ago and I'm still recovering (i.e. no period back yet).

All of this is to say - I know d&c seems like the ""quick"" route, but it may not be. I don't know if it was the right choice - I wish I'd gotten a second opinion about the pills. The only benefits were 1) not having to keep walking around pregnant/starting to show, and 2) the ability to do the chromosomal analysis, which gave us a lot of closure given that roller coaster with the heartbeats.

I need to back away from the parenting groups I'm in. People casually talking about adding to their families like it's the same thing as calling in a takeout order is really triggering for me. Someone just asked about how hard it is to be a single parent to more than one kid because she's divorced and considering a second. No mention of how conception of said second child might happen, which seems like it might be something to think about?

Sorry, I know people who haven't suffered any losses don't often stop to think that they might, but everyone's naive assumption that it will definitely be nbd for them really grates on me.

Hi there. I didn‚Äôt have a d&e but did deliver a son in 2014 at 22 weeks due to IC. I‚Äôve since carried two babies successfully to term after receiving prophylactic cerclages, taking p-17 injections, and being carefully monitored.

I did find that my doctors talked about waiting a few cycles if I need the break mentally and needed to grieve. In fact had an MFM tell me that in the context of ‚Äúhow long can we wait to try again?‚Äù Doctors will often give BS medical reasons to wait because some think that waiting helps some patients psychologically. But really...there‚Äôs no reason to wait physiologically. It did take me two years to get pregnant again, but that was because of my many fertility issues and had nothing to do with IC. We started trying again two months after my loss when my period returned. 

If you want to hear more about my life and the pregnancies I had after my loss, I‚Äôm happy to talk anytime over PM. I am so so sorry that you‚Äôve had to endure this. Sending you a big hug.

1 - Take it one second at a time.  Then a minute, then an hour, then a day.  Whatever you need to do just just ""make it.""

2 - You can control your body by what you eat, think, and how you treat it (I.e., exercise)

3 - Focus on your wedding.  You don't want the story to be about the miscarriage.  You want it to be about your future husband.  Your union together.

4 - If you are concerned, a blood test can be run for miscarriage.  It is often done after several, but I am sure you can push.

5 - Another way to look at ""infertility"" is you simply see someone who is a specialist that can help ensure you don't miscarry again.

I didn‚Äôt want to try and wait because I was going to travel for 2 weeks, then it was Christmas and I would have had to wait at least 3 weeks more. I couldn‚Äôt deal with knowing that I was still carrying a dead baby, it was just too much.
