Sorry. Last night I hugely fucked up. I was at a work party/fundraiser thing and had a couple beers. At the end of the night I started talking to this lady. She asked me if I had kids and for some reason I decided to tell her ""no living children."" Big mistake. She then basically proceeded to tell me that I need therapy and god. I told her I believe there is no god and she just couldn't stop forcing her ideas on me. I held back tears for 90% of this conversation. Then she says ""dont you just wish that when you die god could give you an eternity with your son?"" Umm.. nope. Why should my son and I both have to die to be together? Wtf. She wouldn't let it go. I told her I couldn't have this conversation anymore and walked outside to sit with my husband. She followed me out there! That's when I lost it on her. She's never experienced loss. She doesn't even know anyone that has either. Her attitude towards the topic was as if I was providing her juicy gossip and she just wanted more and more even though I was in tears at this point. I told her she doesn't understand and probably never will and hopefully her children will outlive her. I also told her that what she was saying to me was horrible for her to say to someone that's gone through this shit and that I can't believe I trusted her with my story. And then I left the party.

Sorry. Last night I hugely fucked up. I was at a work party/fundraiser thing and had a couple beers. At the end of the night I started talking to this lady. She asked me if I had kids and for some reason I decided to tell her &quot;no living children.&quot; Big mistake. She then basically proceeded to tell me that I need therapy and god. I told her I believe there is no god and she just couldn&#39;t stop forcing her ideas on me. I held back tears for 90% of this conversation. Then she says &quot;dont you just wish that when you die god could give you an eternity with your son?&quot; Umm.. nope. Why should my son and I both have to die to be together? Wtf. She wouldn&#39;t let it go. I told her I couldn&#39;t have this conversation anymore and walked outside to sit with my husband. She followed me out there! That&#39;s when I lost it on her. She&#39;s never experienced loss. She doesn&#39;t even know anyone that has either. Her attitude towards the topic was as if I was providing her juicy gossip and she just wanted more and more even though I was in tears at this point. I told her she doesn&#39;t understand and probably never will and hopefully her children will outlive her. I also told her that what she was saying to me was horrible for her to say to someone that&#39;s gone through this shit and that I can&#39;t believe I trusted her with my story. And then I left the party. I sobbed in the car on the way home. FUCK that bitch. I just can&#39;t even believe that I had such a negative experience sharing my story about my dead babies. I hate people sometimes.</p>

My body is a mess (regular cycles at least) but I’ve been having cramps almost everyday after ovulation for the last three cycles. Tingly boobs two days ago that probably mean nothing. It was easy for her, I’m sorry but she can’t understand. Same as I can’t understand other experiences.</p>

Sorry man. That bites. 

Okay so maybe not constructive (you know, indulging consumerist tendencies, not living the most fiscally responsible life possible,etc) but now that we are TTC again and I'm dreading my period I've decided that on CD1 I'm splurging on something I want but wouldn't normally let myself get.

I don’t think you should ignore it, but yes follow up with your doctor and get a re-test.  And even if it came back the same, I don’t think you are doomed.  No good doctor is going to look at your AMH alone and predict much.  It’s one data point. I’d still say your age and that you’ve gotten pregnant before are really positive signs.  It might mean doing some further testing and try to get a sense of the whole picture and then deciding from there if further interventions are warrented.  In my case, I’m 38 and I’ve never gotten pregnant without fertility treatments and my RE hasn’t said I’m a hopeless case or anything along those lines.  </p>

Has anyone else ever been in this situation? I am pretty gutted. I've been pregnant twice in the last 18 months with one loss at 13 weeks.

It especially sucks because I had a good career development this week and am waiting to sign a big contract for a big client. I just can't feel happy. The miscarriage has destroyed me.

We weren't using Clomid--not sure if that makes any difference.  And we had a genetic diagnosis for our son, so a possible infection was not an issue. 

But still, 6 months seems excessive to me.  When women deliver full term, the 6-month wait can be advised, to reduce the risk of premature birth/low birth rate in the next pregnancy.  

But even then, some women are told they can try again earlier, and I've never seen that 6-month rule applied for 2nd tri losses.  In general, the recent data say that for miscarriages, TTC again within 3 months of the loss is at least as safe as waiting 4 months or more.

I would call the specialists office again, and tell them that you've gotten conflicting advice from your OB and them, and would like some clarification as to why they made the recommendation.  

What specifically are you/they waiting to ""rebound""?  How do they know this is a problem at the moment?  How is recovery measured?  

Alternatively, you can take this information back to your OB, and get their second opinion.  They might be able to talk to the specialist, too. (My OB is definitely my advocate with other offices/departments.)  If the recommendation is solid, your OB might do a better job of explaining why the specialist's recommendation was different.  And if it's not evidence-based, your OB has the experience/authority to question it in a way patients might not.  

Hope you get better answers soon.  In the meantime, keep taking care of yourself.

<p>Alternatively, you can take this information back to your OB, and get their second opinion.  They might be able to talk to the specialist, too. (My OB is definitely my advocate with other offices/departments.)  If the recommendation is solid, your OB might do a better job of explaining why the specialist&#39;s recommendation was different.  And if it&#39;s not evidence-based, your OB has the experience/authority to question it in a way patients might not.  </p>

<p>Hope you get better answers soon.  In the meantime, keep taking care of yourself.  </p>

<p>ETA: Even if you&#39;re on the fence about starting TTC or if the recommendation turns out to be legitimate, this sub is still the place to be.  Lots of support for healing, and on Wednesdays, there&#39;s specifically a thread for those &quot;waiting to try&quot;.</p>

He started saying that HSG is not necessary since it&#39;s mostly used to confirm that fallopian tubes are open.

He seemed to be annoyed slightly saying that we are not going through the steps and that we are doing more tests than necessary at this stage with 2 miscarriages. He said that we should start trying again and test the tissue for chromosome disorder if miscarried again. He also doesn&#39;t think it&#39;s necessary to see an RE yet.

Now I’m back at work, and the hospital is, predictably, filled with sweaty, happy pregnant women. I should be 8 months pregnant right now.

On second thought, maybe I’ll treat myself to that extra large almond croissant after all...

I’m currently more pregnant than I have ever been before. I have a great team and a plan with my doctors and really I can run in to see them whenever I need reassurance and they will never brush me off. That being said just last night I made a comment “if we bring this baby home” and I refuse to call her my rainbow baby because William was supposed to be my rainbow and so was the pregnancy after him.

It’s fucking hard. I had some mental health issues after losing William which I think is understandable and the postpartum hormone fluctuations did not help in any of that.

<p>I’m currently more pregnant than I have ever been before. I have a great team and a plan with my doctors and really I can run in to see them whenever I need reassurance and they will never brush me off. That being said just last night I made a comment “if we bring this baby home” and I refuse to call her my rainbow baby because William was supposed to be my rainbow and so was the pregnancy after him.</p>

<p>It’s fucking hard. I had some mental health issues after losing William which I think is understandable and the postpartum hormone fluctuations did not help in any of that.

I even told my family that I&#39;m not looking for a fix or a solution, just be there to listen and say &#39;i&#39;m sorry and it&#39;s really sh*t&#39;. You&#39;ll be surprised how many people have experienced a miscarriage or know someone close to them who has. It&#39;s a shame more people dont share their experience as it would make opening up a lot easier, it&#39;s nothing to be ashamed of and it&#39;s incredibly common. I don&#39;t know where you&#39;re from but I found a load of information and other people&#39;s stories on the Miscarriage Association website useful and whilst reading some stories made me cry more, it was actually comforting to know I wasn&#39;t alone. I&#39;m a week into recovery after my second miscarriage. You will get through this and it will get easier, I promise. <a href=""http://www.miscarriageassociation.org.uk"">www.miscarriageassociation.org.uk</a></p>

I wasn't in a good place emotionally the last time I checked in. I'm doing a little better now. I swear my cat knows when I'm sad so she's been extra attached recently. https://imgur.com/81WNfAO

We aren't telling my in-laws about this pregnancy. There's been drama in the form of silence since they told us to ""get over it,"" referring to our stillborn daughter, on Thanksgiving. As you can imagine, there were a lot more hurtful things said for us to make this decision.

If there is absolutely anything I can do to prevent this from happening again I would hope to know before I get into it again. thank you so much!

The SAME thing happened to me a few months ago. I am a nurse too and even with all the knowledge we have I still kept wondering what I could have done better/not done to prevent it. 

The worst part was after finding out. It sounds crass but I just wanted everything over and done with so I could move on and work on healing. I did the misporostol and it didn’t work so I had to wait for a D&C a week later. I felt like my body belonged to some foreign imposter during the two weeks of finding out until finally having the D&C. Then it took another month to get a period again. I told a bunch of people too and it was so awkward having to tell people I wasn’t pregnant anymore. I just told most people I had a miscarriage, it was easier than going into the whole story with people.  But like someone mentioned before I was surprised to find out how many people I know that have had miscarriages too. It’s sad people don’t talk more about them and take some of the shame and stigma out. I think it would ease some of the guilt and anxiety we go through after. 

I think the hardest part has been the fact this was my first pregnancy also. Having that first positive test and telling my husband, those things I won’t get back. I actually just found out a few days ago that I am pregnant again (!) which is exciting BUT it’s not the same unencumbered joy I had before. I told my husband after getting the positive and he could barely muster much excitement. It’s not that he isn’t looking forward to being a dad, he just is scared. He honestly took the loss harder emotionally than I did. I think being a nurse did help me put it more into perspective-and I think just the general hard shit we see on a regular basis. 

We told both sets of parents but have sworn them to very strict secrecy until at least after the first official ultrasound, probably the 8 or 9 week mark. Definitely not telling everyone like I did last time. We will probably wait until the traditional 12 week mark to make any announcement, assuming everything is normal this go round. I kind of feel like this time is the true test, one miscarriage/issue can just be a fluke, but a second time and something is wrong, ya know?

I remember crying when a large chunk came out, but then I woke up in the recovery room. I bled lightly for the next few days, then spotted off and on for 2 weeks. Every time I thought I was done spotting, it would start again. Physically, it only affected me the day of and after. Emotionally, I&#39;m still dealing with it. Feel free to message me, it really helps to talk about it.</p>

This post is so real to me, as I wrote a very similar post this week about my first pregnancy resulting in a loss. I was 8.5 weeks along when I was told the baby stopped growing at 6 weeks 3 days. I had last saw the baby at 6 weeks 2 days during an ultrasound, where we saw the heartbeat. I naively thought that was the green light that I had a viable pregnancy.

I’m still trying to process the grief and fear. I’m fearful that I will experience this again, and then I get overflows of doubt if I will ever be able to have a safe pregnancy with healthy baby in the end.

My water broke on Thurs. we went into the hospital and they almost sent me home since I was at 6.2 AF and they admit at 6. One of the OBs on call decided to keep me and made the decision to induce. 

The next morning I woke up with an insanely chipper OB from my practice breaking my water during a second exam. She said “the decision has been made so your having a baby today.” and gave me the impression she didn’t agree with the first OB but I was so far along at 38 it didn’t matter.

The contractions came on hard before the meds and then rapidly got worse. They expected me to take until the afternoon and it just wasn’t going to happen. It hurt. They did two different epidurals (had an old back injury, it was split and I’m a 6 ft) at the same time while contractions were spiking. 

The baby’s heartbeat keep rapidly changing. They inserted a heart monitor in side in addition to the outer while giving me Fentayl along with the epidural. Her heart rate was going down rapidly. 

The pain meds did not work.

A fast decision was made to do an emergency c-section. My husband was kicked away and they didn’t tell him what was happening I was just wheeled away. I am so thankful. There was no back and forth. It was instant.

In the OR there was they had an emotional support nurse. She explained to me quickly what was happening. The epidural and pain meds did not work. They switched me to the other bed and prepped the curtain. They went through the pain meds I was given to each other and put oxygen on and started quick prep. They pinched my skin and I couldn’t vocalize or sign since I was on boards that I felt it before it started. 

I felt them cut me. I felt them slice me. 

The pain meds did not work which is extremely unusual. It’s me. I do not blame them as it happened before in dental surgery. It’s my weird tall body and chemistry. 

I screamed and went into cardiac arrest likely from shock. A crash team came in or something I don’t know but I heard them say “losing her, losing her.” Lots of beeping and cussing. 

I felt warm like I was floating. Like I was sinking into the most wonderful hot tub but it was above me. Like sinking above. I didn’t have any thoughts but how it didn’t hurt and I was so warm. No more thoughts. It only lasted a few seconds. Then it was a hard SLAM!, coldness, and I heard “she’s back” the nice nurse was humming and patting my head. It was seconds. I had pain but no air like frozen choking. 

I “woke up” in recovery hours later. I was so angry and groggy. My poor husband was there crying and excited about the baby. I honestly forgot about her. They put her to my breast and she suckled but I didn’t know who the baby was or who all these people were. 

Our baby is too small. Despite being 38.4 weeks and full term, she never made it to 4 lbs because of a knot in the cord. I KNEW SOMETHING WAS WRONG with the cord but it’s not something you can see in the ultrasound. Because my daughter is 22 inches long (!), they assumed and she looked like she was at birthweight in the ultrasound. She is breathing on her own, having major blood sugar issues, and I can only touch her through the incubator. 

I have burn marks on my chest and I’m all cut up. I’m trying to pump regardless and I got some colostrum out just a few drops. We’ve had lawyers in and out and experts and all in exhausting. I’m so sore. I’m black, blue, burned, and have so many scars. My body is a different one from yesterday but we’re alive. 

Before I was on state healthcare, food stamps, WIC, and other welfare with my sons’ death and miscarriages. Not to go into too much detail but it was negligence in my past care that lead to miscarriages and my sons’ deaths. After when we were poor, we started suing with the lawyers poor people can afford as the OB had a prior unpublished issues and joined suit with other parents of lost children. Florida has a cap on medical malpractice (which anyone who lives here gets all those papers to sign and knows). 

It’s fucked how different my treatment is now that we have money. After my sons’ death I had to recover on my own. I’m getting a facial and pedicure from my hospital spa menu today. Three years ago, I was tossed out while still bleeding with our twins ashes in ziplocks and handfuls of Percocet prescriptions. It’s never been so clear the divide until now. I’m grateful for our expensive insurance and our lifestyle that allows for so much but how I wish my sons’ would’ve been treated like my daughter. 

I might get to hold her if she’s well enough today. Right now I can only see her a few times a day for limited visits. The rest of the time is my recovery. I can’t stop looking at her pictures. She’s so skinny and long like me! I love her and I hope she’ll forgive me for this time separated. My husband is amazing through all of it but feels so divided between the two of us.

TL:DR I actually died yesterday, have a NICU baby, might get to hold her soon, I need therapy from this",[],,t1_dzlsad0,False,0,[],False,"<div class=""md""><p>TRIGGER WARNING: I died, incubator living baby</p>

<p>My water broke on Thurs. we went into the hospital and they almost sent me home since I was at 6.2 AF and they admit at 6. One of the OBs on call decided to keep me and made the decision to induce. </p>

<p>The next morning I woke up with an insanely chipper OB from my practice breaking my water during a second exam. She said “the decision has been made so your having a baby today.” and gave me the impression she didn’t agree with the first OB but I was so far along at 38 it didn’t matter.</p>

<p>The contractions came on hard before the meds and then rapidly got worse. They expected me to take until the afternoon and it just wasn’t going to happen. It hurt. They did two different epidurals (had an old back injury, it was split and I’m a 6 ft) at the same time while contractions were spiking. </p>

<p>The baby’s heartbeat keep rapidly changing. They inserted a heart monitor in side in addition to the outer while giving me Fentayl along with the epidural. Her heart rate was going down rapidly. </p>

<p>The pain meds did not work.</p>

<p>A fast decision was made to do an emergency c-section. My husband was kicked away and they didn’t tell him what was happening I was just wheeled away. I am so thankful. There was no back and forth. It was instant.</p>

<p>In the OR there was they had an emotional support nurse. She explained to me quickly what was happening. The epidural and pain meds did not work. They switched me to the other bed and prepped the curtain. They went through the pain meds I was given to each other and put oxygen on and started quick prep. They pinched my skin and I couldn’t vocalize or sign since I was on boards that I felt it before it started. </p>

<p>I felt them cut me. I felt them slice me. </p>

<p>The pain meds did not work which is extremely unusual. It’s me. I do not blame them as it happened before in dental surgery. It’s my weird tall body and chemistry. </p>

<p>I screamed and went into cardiac arrest likely from shock. A crash team came in or something I don’t know but I heard them say “losing her, losing her.” Lots of beeping and cussing. </p>

<p>I felt warm like I was floating. Like I was sinking into the most wonderful hot tub but it was above me. Like sinking above. I didn’t have any thoughts but how it didn’t hurt and I was so warm. No more thoughts. It only lasted a few seconds. Then it was a hard SLAM!, coldness, and I heard “she’s back” the nice nurse was humming and patting my head. It was seconds. I had pain but no air like frozen choking. </p>

<p>I “woke up” in recovery hours later. I was so angry and groggy. My poor husband was there crying and excited about the baby. I honestly forgot about her. They put her to my breast and she suckled but I didn’t know who the baby was or who all these people were. </p>

<p>Our baby is too small. Despite being 38.4 weeks and full term, she never made it to 4 lbs because of a knot in the cord. I KNEW SOMETHING WAS WRONG with the cord but it’s not something you can see in the ultrasound. Because my daughter is 22 inches long (!), they assumed and she looked like she was at birthweight in the ultrasound. She is breathing on her own, having major blood sugar issues, and I can only touch her through the incubator. </p>

<p>I have burn marks on my chest and I’m all cut up. I’m trying to pump regardless and I got some colostrum out just a few drops. We’ve had lawyers in and out and experts and all in exhausting. I’m so sore. I’m black, blue, burned, and have so many scars. My body is a different one from yesterday but we’re alive. </p>

<p>Before I was on state healthcare, food stamps, WIC, and other welfare with my sons’ death and miscarriages. Not to go into too much detail but it was negligence in my past care that lead to miscarriages and my sons’ deaths. After when we were poor, we started suing with the lawyers poor people can afford as the OB had a prior unpublished issues and joined suit with other parents of lost children. Florida has a cap on medical malpractice (which anyone who lives here gets all those papers to sign and knows). </p>

<p>It’s fucked how different my treatment is now that we have money. After my sons’ death I had to recover on my own. I’m getting a facial and pedicure from my hospital spa menu today. Three years ago, I was tossed out while still bleeding with our twins ashes in ziplocks and handfuls of Percocet prescriptions. It’s never been so clear the divide until now. I’m grateful for our expensive insurance and our lifestyle that allows for so much but how I wish my sons’ would’ve been treated like my daughter. </p>

<p>I might get to hold her if she’s well enough today. Right now I can only see her a few times a day for limited visits. The rest of the time is my recovery. I can’t stop looking at her pictures. She’s so skinny and long like me! I love her and I hope she’ll forgive me for this time separated. My husband is amazing through all of it but feels so divided between the two of us. Luckily, I have to sleep a lot. </p>

Equally bad, if not worse: [Texas](https://gizmodo.com/texas-senate-passes-bill-allowing-doctors-to-withhold-i-1793505625), Oklahoma, and other states have made it *legal* for doctors to not tell parents about birth defects they find during prenatal care.  

I.e. Doctors can withhold this information and send parents away thinking they have a healthy baby.  And then when the baby is born with birth defects and they learn this was known from the scans all along, the parents can't sue the doctors or the hospitals.  

These policies don't just affect families who may have terminated and their children, but also affect serious cases where families might chose to continue the pregnancy.  We needed to know about my son's CHD in advance.  My doctor was switching me to high-risk monitoring.  Our cardiologist met with the surgeons to determine a surgical strategy.  We needed to plan for a c-section and he would have gone almost straight into open heart surgery on a heart-lung-bypass machine.  Only about 3 hospitals in the state do this type of surgery, so we had to had to make arrangements.  All that to have even an 85% chance of survival. (50% if he didn't make it to term.)

If OBs or radiologists had withheld information about serious CHDs, we and his doctors couldn't have planned for their care, it would have put his life at greater risk.  We might have been able to sue for wrongful death, but that wouldn't bring our baby back.  

ETA: I *do* share our story with my friends and family.  I let my husband decide what to share with his friends.  Though there are still occasions with people we don't know well where it feels more appropriate to say ""loss"".  In general, I try to be open about it, because I don't want other babies to have to go through what my son would have...

I hear your sense of violation and betrayal by your state.  Yesterday, I refrained from saying much about this, because I value the unity of this subreddit.  But given the detail you went into here, I'll do the same here.

I agree with everything you've written--I won't reiterate your points.  Our state is not as restrictive as some, and I think every family should get the type of care we received.  But *still* our experience has convinced me that the laws are not accommodating enough.  When a congenital defect is found at the 20 week anatomy scan, it might have to be followed by other specialty exams.  MRIs or fetal echocardiograms. Second opinions. An amnio (which takes 2-3 weeks to return results).    

All of this takes time.  And yet, because so many states have 22 or 24 week limits on abort!ons, parents often have to make a decision about their child's life *before* they have all of the information.  You would think that ""pro-life"" politicians would give parents every opportunity to seek hope for their child's prognosis---include exceptions to these limits that allow parents to delay making a decision until all the testing can be done and second opinions sought, resources for raising a child with their child's condition can be consulted.   It's their child's *life*.  Those babies *deserve* that.  

But no.  The reality is that parents are sat down by someone and told that maybe their child's condition is ""isolated"", and they won't have additional serious problems, but sometimes it's associated with one of many syndromes, with many additional and devastating impairments.  If it's not T21, they'll be told they're on their own in terms of coordinating among the 10+ specialists and all the surgeries their babies will need from birth. And that's all parents have time to learn before they have to make a decision.    It's an awful position to put parents in.  

And that's the better case scenario.  My home state passed a law limiting abort!ons to 20 weeks, so parents who get serious diagnoses don't have a say about what happens to their child, unless they can travel to another state.  

It's also clear to me that most politicians don't know what kind of suffering they're committing children to when they implement these restrictions.  Cases like my son's are very medically complex--how could a politician with zero knowledge of his condition legislate what was best for him?

I find it a double standard that it's permissible and ""moral"" to decide not to pursue treatment and let my son die over the course of days after birth--with the suffering that entails, but it's illegal and ""immoral"" to ensure he has a painless death at 24+1 weeks gestation. Just because it's a ""natural"" death doesn't mean it’s a good death or morally superior.  

Politicians have a lot of concern about fetal pain when it comes to banning abort!on (and that's not a 100% bad thing), but they have no concern for forcing sick babies into the post-28 or 29 week stage where they *will* definitely feel pain and *will* suffer.  Again, it's a double standard.   

It also upsets me that if my son had been stillborn at 23wks, he would have gotten a death certificate, but because we elected the termination, he doesn't.  As if the fact that he was so sick and we elected the termination made him less of a person.  We're not allowed to acknowledge his personhood with a death certificate, because then politicians would wield that against other families to ban terminations at that stage altogether.

And yes, Texas brands its policies as protecting ""women's health"", but the reality is *you* can't get care from your experienced provider, and now have to worry about complications, scarring, etc.  Not to mention that abort!on clinics aren't equipped to support the mental health needs of TFMR families.

I had a crash c section almost 12 weeks ago. I've asked in various forums and two different doctors(two MFM's) and the answer varies. I've heard some doctors say three months, some two years, and everything in between. 

One MFM said to wait at least two cycles, but was open to another timeline. A MFM from Stanford said she recommends a year, but bare minimum since I am older(just turned 38) is six months. 

The timeline is shorter because I plan to have a repeat c section. Mostly because I want/need to be pregnant sooner rather than later due to my age, but also because this labor was extremely traumatic and where we lost her. They think it was due to a pinched cord that happened in the literal last moments of labor. 

My doula attends a lot of VBAC's, and for that the standard recommendation is 18 months between labors, meaning wait 9 months before trying.  With a VBAC you need to go into labor on your own, no chemical induction, or you risk uterine rupture. next pregnancy I will not be going into labor, any hint of contractions and I am to go straight to L&D.

I'm going for it right now, three months out. Who knows if I actually ovulated as I didn't commit to temping like I should have.

The first week or so after my D&C, I had a lot of cramping and pain, so although I was sad, I think my physical discomfort prevented me from grieving at that time. Once my body had begun to heal, the grief was pretty strong. I would say about a month, then I felt like I would have more good days then bad for the next few months.

It hit me again around Christmas though.

I’m right there with you. My SIL is pregnant with her third, due 4 weeks after what would’ve been my due date. I have a 2.5 year old daughter and she is very close with her cousins so my SIL and I were so excited that we were going to have kids the same age. On top of that, one of my good friend that I go to church with and who has a son who’s a week younger than my daughter, just had twins. We were excited to be pregnant again at the same time because it’s been so sweet watching our kids grow up together. 

Right after my loss, it wasn’t so bad to be around them because they weren’t showing and they weren’t talking about their pregnancies. But after they started really showing and the baby talk came back, I haven’t been able to be around them. I used to see them both several times each week and I just can’t now. The reality has set in that their babies are fine and mine isn’t. It’s just a constant reminder that I should be still be pregnant when I think of them. 

I haven’t met my friend’s twins yet and couldn’t bring myself to check Facebook and see pictures of them until they were about 5 weeks old. I have no idea what I will do when my new niece is born because I can’t avoid my family forever but the thought of being around her is torture right now because I will constantly be thinking of my son who should be sitting next to her.

I hope it gets better.   </p>

I went into this pregnancy determined it would be my last, no matter the outcome and was just calm and detached about it. I knew I would either get a baby and then a hysterectomy or would only have to deal with one more loss and then get a hysterectomy. It was liberating for me.

Feeling hopeful isn’t a requirement. Blood work isn’t either. I didn’t feel any hope, attachment or excitement until I had two good ultrasounds, and with losses #3 and #4, I had perfect betas, so I opted not to even do them this time. Even still, every time I got good news, I was caught off guard. It was difficult to believe things were continuing to go well. It may not have been the healthiest mindset, but I felt healthier and more sane than in any of my previous pregnancies.

I went into the hospital at 23 weeks having contractions, and then I had to be on opioids for a degenerating and inflammation-causing giant fibroid until I stopped working at 34 weeks. I’ve gotten weekly ultrasounds since 23 weeks, and sometime in that time period, I accepted that things were going well for the baby, despite the fact that the extra monitoring was because things were *not*going well for me and could have potentially been bad for her. But she was always fine.

My due date is in 2 days, and other than being in pain (but wonderful, *normal* end-of-pregnancy pain!) and being frustrated that my cervix refuses to dilate, I’m feeling hopeful and excited about giving birth and bringing this baby home.

That was rambling, but basically, after multiple losses, you’re going to expect things to go wrong until they do or until they don’t. And that’s okay. You don’t have to feel positive or hopeful or excited for your pregnancy to be successful. Just take care of yourself and try not to ruminate and drive yourself crazy.

The best advice I can give you is to be honest. They don’t want to see you hurt. They will understand. I talked to my friend and let her know how happy I was for her (she had trouble conceiving a healthy child for a while now) but I needed some space.

My point is people who care about you will understand and not be offended. But they don’t know how you’re feeling if you’re not open about it. And it’s ok to not be ok. You’ve went through one of the worst things anyone can imagine. 

This is just one of those cases where you need it help them help you. They can’t read your mind. And as long as you go with the “I’m fine” company line so prevalent,  they will think you’re fine. Because you told them. So don’t tell them.

<p>In my first pregnancy, I was diagnosed with a MMC at 7 wks (baby never grew beyond 6+3). I had told my close friends, coworkers, my parents, and my brother.

My son Connor died in a similar fashion. He died from GBS sepsis even though I tested negative.

When he just wasn't recovering and things were spiraling out of control as you say, they found the sepsis. He died 12 hours after birth. Everyone, including medical staff, were shocked.

I've since had subsequent children (a girl then a boy) and it was very difficult but healing. I can't imagine losing another one after what you've gone through. While Connor didn't have a twin, his brother looks remarkably like him, and I get what you're feeling.

I had an early scan (too excited about my first pregnancy!) to show a heartbeat at 7+5, next scan at 11 weeks showed baby had stopped growing at 10weeks. I decided to go the natural route. I waited 5 weeks but my body held on, so I went for misoprostol but I guess that’s technically ‘natural’ as in, no D&C. 

Like another reply stated, it’s not like a period, it’s more like a mini birth. So expect and don’t be too alarmed if it hurts a fair amount more than period cramps.

I’d recommend it but I have some tips;
- ask for hard core painkillers. I can’t take ibuprofen (due to Crohn’s disease) so I asked for opiate based. Though I only ended up taking those after I passed the baby. I took higher doses of paracetamol to take the edge off.
- heating pads and hot water bottles
- lots of towels underneath you where ever you are. My waters broke and made a mess but then once I started really bleeding, it was also easy to soak through a pad.
- get a lot of those heavy duty thick pads
- do not be alone for the process, if you can have your partner or a trusted person with you to help.
- stay hydrated. Super important. I went with coconut water specifically. Try to keep easy but sugary stuff to eat too, like a granola bar. You might not be hungry during but after you may be.
- keep a notebook and pen nearby and make a note of when you’re taking painkillers and also when you’re changing a pad. You need to know that although the bleeding seems like a ton, it’s very normal BUT it’s good to keep track just in case it becomes more than it should. I believe if it is soaking more than 2 pads per hour/half hour then you should call midwife/OB.
- I drank a ton of red raspberry leaf tea prior to help my contractions be more effective. I believe it helped but my midwife is dubious. 
- the pain got really really intense just before it got better. Once the sac and baby passed, I felt the biggest relief and the pain subsided immediately so don’t be discouraged!
- I found that laying down didn’t help, it seemed to slow down my contractions. I ended up on all fours and leaning on chairs.

I don’t have any advice specific to d&c/d&e as my TFMR was at 25w5d, however I do have advice with regards to preventing your milk from coming in.

The best thing you can do is wear a supportive, lightly padded sports bra constantly for the first week. This includes while you’re sleeping. The idea is to remove the chance of anything, even your shirt, from rubbing against your nipples. Also, keep your showers short and avoid the warm water being on your breasts as much as possible. During my showers I wore a bathing suit top but again you can just wear a sports bra, and then when you get out of the shower stick an ice pack (lightly wrapped in a tea towel) in your bra against each breast/nipple for ~5 minutes (the warm water is a big milk trigger but the ice pack tells your boobs to cut it out).

You may not need to do this the whole week, generally milk comes in 3-5 days after the placenta detaches. I did it for 2 weeks out of paranoia because I had an overproduction of milk with my LC so my OB told me there was a high likelihood my milk would come in despite them giving me a dose of medication to suppress it (not sure if that medication is standard).

It's not possible to say a cause without further testing, and even then it may very well tell you nothing.

D&C is easy, you just go under and it's done. I did this for my first MC. But I was 12.5 weeks so it was more favorable than other options at that point.

> For those that have had successful pregnancy after a MC, how did you handle telling people, friends and family alike, that you were pregnant?

We always tell family right away. It's no one else's business. Having had losses at 5 weeks and 16 weeks, we think that waiting to announce until it's 'certain' is untenable.  Last time we announced at 14 or 15 weeks, after a great doppler, thinking we were 'safe', only for our son to literally die the next week. Nothing is certain. A baby could die tomorrow, it could could die the week after it's born, or -- hopefully -- it'll die 120 years from now. Either way it's going to die someday and if you're alive for it, you're always going to be the one to announce his/her passing, so you might as well announce whenever *you* feel comfortable. That could be at 3 weeks or it could be when the child is a year old.

We wouldn't announce on social media, because we've always found it a bit over-the-top. We thought that during our first pregnancy and still think that.

Our main reason for not telling people is that we feel a lot of people act bizarre when it comes to unborn children. My wife and I are always happy to conceive, and while I get queasy when people start trying to plan for the baby's birth, I also get upset when people try to pretend the baby doesn't exist because we may face complications in the future. We try to only tell people who agree that -- no matter what happens -- it's a wonderful thing for the baby to be here right now.

<p>So yeah she is my favorite now and I’m making her my doctor. New grad and newest member of the practice, so she has the least patients. I liked “my” OBGYN, but she has the most patients at the practice and that can be a hassle. </p>

I was induced with my son at 18w; he stopped growing at 16w.

Expect a lot of boredom. I arrived at the hospital at 8am, and got my first dose of cerdivil at 9am. If you go this route, you're stuck in bed for the first hour after application. It SUCKS to get those pills up to your cervix, even though they are the size of Tylenol. Really, this is the most physically painful part. I did 4 doses of cerdivil. They may add pitocin at some point, which many women claim makes the process more painful (I've never thought so, so yrmv).

You will be bored, until you aren't. Inductions if this type tend to be waiting, then everything happens at once. If you're not opposed, get an epidural or other pain relief (having gone through almost every pain option offered, I recommend the epi). When my son was actually delivered, I was asleep with an epidural, so it wasn't physically painful at all. He just kind of came.

You don't have to hold your baby. I didn't hold my son (it was suggested he would be in poor condition, and I didn't want to see him like that). It's ok. If you want to, then do. I recommend getting all the memories the staff offer-- footprints, handprints, locks of hair, a blanket your baby was wrapped in, photos. At 16w of growth, my son was too small for the prints, so don't expect them. You can put it away and never look at it again, but you only have one chance to do it. Addirionally, call your OB and ask for copies of any scans you've gotten.

I was up within a few hours. My body felt normal because they're so small at this point. You'll likely have bleeding akin to a period.

I initially wanted a D&E, but I am so glad I had the induction. Reading up on what happens during a D&E/C personally horrified me. That was not how I wanted to treat my son's remains. I felt like I had failed to give him a live, so at least I could give him a dignified death (he was creamated and buried, as well per the rules in my state regarding stillbirths). I had a live birth previously, which was a factor (safer for me to induce). But I want to emphasize that you need to do whatever is best for **your** mental health and **your** body; a D&E over induction would have been worse for me on both counts.

I had a tiny amount of discharge from my nipples but it wasn’t wet when I noticed, and I didn’t notice my bras getting wet. </p>

<p>I am so sorry you are going through this. This has seriously been the hardest thing I have ever gone through and it’s been super painful. I started seeing a counselor to help me go through my grieving process and this sub has helped. Whatever you decide, please know you aren’t alone. Feel free to PM me any time.</p>

We told our older kids (7 and 15 yo) after the 8 week scan. Baby died only a couple of days later but we didn't find out until a week 11 scan.

First I was mad at myself for telling them so early. But then I realized it was important for them to know what was up with me. The d&c was one day before my younger sons birthday and I couldn't stop crying. 

Last week we talked to another mom at school. She said that she always wanted a sibling for her son but it just didn't happen. My son interrupted the grown-up talk and said that there had been a sibling in my tummy but.that it died when it was still in there. I realized that instance that it was not only MY baby that died. It was his sibling and he had every right to know.

So, I guess I will tell them again at about 8 weeks. If it makes it to 8 weeks. If I do get pregnant again...

I would also tell my close family and close friends at about that time and even my boss and a couple of coworkers. They would find out anyways if I miscarry again. 

So many women told me that something like this (or worse) happened to them as well. We are not alone out there. If we feel like it we should be able to talk about it. Well and if we don't feel like it we shouldn't I guess...

My husband and I have lost seven babies and I'm currently early in pregnancy once again. 

With our first baby, we planned on telling our parents at 9 weeks, on Easter. We lost the baby the Friday before Easter and had to share that we were pregnant and that the baby had died at the same time. It was awful. 

We had a few early losses afterwards and at the time, decided not to share any information about the pregnancies or the losses with our families. That was also awful - eventually we told our parents so they would understand what was going on and we could get support. 

With our last pregnancy, we shared with our parents as soon as we had a positive pregnancy test and we continued to share as our baby boy grew. At 14 weeks, with many good ultrasounds, we shared with our extended families. We lost our son at 16 weeks and we shared that loss on Facebook. I feel we were kind of pressured into telling our extended families by our parents, but I am happy that the loss was shared. The part I hate about telling people that I'm pregnant is the happy, care-free reactions.

TW: CURRENT PREGNANCY

I am early in pregnancy again. We told my parents and my FIL right away. My MIL was travelling, so we told her a few weeks later. I've told two people who supported us through our last loss and they responded perfectly - happy, but understanding of the fact that life is always uncertain. My husband has told his bosses because he's needed time off for our appointments. I would prefer to not tell our extended families until we lose the baby or is alive and well. But that's probably not going to happen since we'll be seeing them and it's hard to hide. I'm hoping the reception of our news will be relatively somber. I have found it somewhat helpful to provide people with a template for their reaction, ""I have some news. We aren't ready for congratulations. I am pregnant again. We are happy to have another chance, but we are very afraid of another loss. Please pray for us."" I find that gets me the reaction I'm hoping for more often than just saying I'm pregnant.

I really, really can't believe I'm here.  I'm grateful but still terrified.  Still spotting a little and on pelvic rest.  Also have a yeast infection, which is just super.  I had my OB transfer appointment (from RE's office) today, which was nice but also anxiety-inducing, because clearly to them I'm just a healthy pregnant lady.  My midwife did let me book an ultrasound for Friday though, to check on the SCH, and then next week I have to have the ""OB Coordinator"" visit where they tell me all about delivering with their practice, which a) I already know about because I've had a baby with them, and b) is too soon.  How do I know I'm keeping this baby?!  Why are you wasting my time with an hour of ""how we deliver your baby""?  Come on.  

I will say that as much as I'm not ready to talk about delivering, my midwife wasn't nearly as ""YAY VBAC"" as I had expected, which makes me nervous. 

I told her about my anxiety attacks, and she prescribed something for me to have on hand, which I really appreciate.  She also mentioned if I had depression flaring up to just come in and they're happy to work on finding a med that will work for me and pregnancy.  I really needed and appreciated that.  So, for anyone who feels like their anxiety is crippling sometimes, I think it's a great idea to mention it to your provider.  I am pro-medicating this time around for anything that's safe and makes my mental state a little easier.

Gosh, I feel like this too. I have already thought through my ""birth plan"" in the case where this baby dies and started to worry about arranging for the burial, etc. I feel a little crazy writing that.

I also feel this semi-frequently. Sometimes I feel very ambivalent about being pregnant/having a baby. I wonder if maybe our previous babies died because God knows we'd be terrible parents and don't deserve to be happy. One thing that has helped me feel better is talking to my mom. My parents are so confident that my husband and I will be good parents, and I trust their judgement since I think they were pretty good parents. Also, my mom says she felt this way even though she didn't lose any babies. She told me that these types of worries start during pregnancy and last a lifetime - she still sometimes wonders if she's doing a ""good enough"" job mothering her adult children.

Speaking of moms, I think it's totally worth asking your mom for help and company! Pregnancy is hard physically and after loss it's so emotional too. There's no failure in needing a helping hand.

With our first, we told both families on my mom's birthday by wrapping up pictures of the ultrasound. What fools. We later miscarried about two weeks later, while on our dream vacation in the mediterranean. It was really bad, I required a D&C and a blood transfusion in a foreign country. My husband was scared for my life and we were grateful that we could call my parents and tell them about the miscarriage rather than my husband having to call them and tell them I didn't make it.

After that, with our second loss, we didn't tell anyone about the pregnancy, but we told our families and my best friends about the loss. I was also hemorrhaging blood there but thankfully only needed a D&E and not a blood transfusion. 

The third loss... well, it was very early and probably classified as a chemical. We told my family because my husband had to go to his brother's bachelor party so we had my mom come and stay with me in case I lost a lot of blood. Thankfully, that was the least traumatic of the three.

So here I am now... if I could have, I would have waited until I got the NIPT results back to tell anyone. But... my sister was picking wedding dates and leaning towards my due date, so I had to tell my family. But we waited until the NIPT results to tell hubby's family, and we only started telling work and other friends after 20 weeks. 

We both quit social media, so definitely no big social announcement either. :-) 

Honestly, it's really up to you and what you feel comfortable with. The only thing I really regret is those stupid framed ultrasounds. We gave one to each of our mothers. I still wonder what they did with them.

<p>I get to choose between a spinal or a GA for the c-section due to anxiety. Im thinking about it overnight then I will discuss it with my OB tomorrow. My gut says GA because of some epidural issues with my first birth and how panicky I&#39;ve been, but I don&#39;t know if those reasons are good enough and I&#39;m just being weak. </p>

<p>So I&#39;m reassured by excellent staff who genuinely seemed to care about my treatment, but just a bit nervous now that I will make a bad choice. </p>

In terms of timing the pregnancy I lost was perfect. I would still be doing my PhD, defending some time after the baby would have been born and with the new situation in mind, I would be off searching for a new job.

However, that's of course changed, I'm finishing up the PhD now and have to already find a new job. I have opportunities in different countries, but we are not sure whether my husband would come with me if I moved because he also has a career. If we would start living long distance, this is of course terrible for conceiving. And I don't really want to stop ttc now that I know how difficult it can be. And suppose I do get pregnant just before going to this new position abroad, then I'm pregnant alone in another country? Higher chance that my husband would in fact join but still, then I'll worry about him. I've also searched for jobs closer to home but they are all out of my field and hard to get in. And what I really want is a job in my field, as it is truly my passion.

And then there's of course travel! Some friends of us are getting married next year in South East Asia, and of course this is a unique opportunity to see the country with the locals etc. However, suppose I would get pregnant this cycle, then the baby would be two months old by that time. And in later cycles I would be very, very pregnant. For this, I think it would be best to come up with some sort of cut off date. I have to decide at which point I would feel comfortable traveling if I was pregnant and see which cycle that would be. If by that time I would still not be pregnant, I can book the ticket and plan the trip.


BTW, I was reading an article (in my native language) about women having kids at later ages nowadays and the whole ""baby industry"" around it (egg donors, surrogates, mostly those in poor countries). What struck me most of all was how this all came to be. Women have entered the workplace, which lead to more equality, but the workplace did not change to facilitate having children. Women are in a work environment made for (traditional) men. The physiologically best time to have children is during your twenties, but this is also the time that a career is made. Women who get children ""pay"" for this by having a large dip in income from which they may or may not recover at a much later time than men. So they postpone. Feminism wanted to also change the work place to make tasks easier both for women and men in terms of family planning, but did not succeed in this. 

I am not an older woman yet (29) but I do recognise this feeling of having to choose career or family. And now that I chose family and don't know when or how it will be possible as it took quite some time to get pregnant which ended in loss, and afterwards is again taking a lot of time, I feel like I should be going for career in case it will never work out, if only because that would make adoption more feasible.

I can only imagine the difficulty of making a decision about terminating, then expressing your desire to be open about the process, and then having your family straight up lie against your wishes to tell a more palatable story. I would be livid if I were in your shoes.

After our loss, my parents were quite supportive, being helpful with our LC and helpful in the hospital and regularly checking in on us in the days and weeks following. They weren’t perfect and sometimes I felt like their outreach was much more burdensome than it was helpful, but even in the fog of grief I could see they were doing our best to figure out our wishes and respect them. When they missed the mark and I had to angrily correct them, they took my words on board and changed course after a difficult discussion. But my husband’s parents—totally different story. They showed up for the funeral, left town, and then completely checked out of my husband’s life. No phone calls to check in, no texts except ones from his dad about mundane shit we didn’t care about that completely ignored the hellish reality we were living, etc. They just fell off the map for over a month until my FIL wanted to invite himself over while he was in town, and we had to force a difficult conversation with them about why they had completely bailed on their son, who was grieving his own son. 

So we felt very similarly about them in the early months following our loss— we didn’t want to tell them about a subsequent pregnancy, because if they couldn’t be supportive in the awful times, they didn’t get to be hopeful with us in the less awful times. We were both really comfortable with the idea of just...not telling them. We don’t see them often so we probably could have worked around any of those issues, and my one outstanding concern was that one of my husband’s grandparents would die and we’d be obligated to attend a funeral where I might be visibly pregnant and they hadn’t been informed. My husband said that he didn’t see any reason to tell them if I didn’t want to.

[TW: current pregnancy] In the end, we did decide to tell our parents at the same time, but waited until it was absolutely necessary to tell them— around 18 weeks when we were going to happen to see my FIL and I was starting to show in a way that would be hard to pass off as leftover pregnancy weight. We had already told most of our close and most supportive friends, and we held off on telling our families because we didn’t want them to project their anxiety onto us, nor did we feel we could deal with any excitement that we felt would be really premature. It’s up to you how to handle how and when and who you tell about a new pregnancy, but your first priority should be whether you feel as if sharing would relieve some of your burden or add to it. We opted to send an email to family— that way we could include all the relevant pertinent information (yes this was planned, yes this was okayed as safe by a team of doctors, no this isn’t high risk, but yes they’re treating me as high risk, and so forth) so that we wouldn’t have to rehash anyone’s questions over and over and so that we could make it clear that like, here is the relevant information and what was even more relevant was that our anxiety was so high that discussing the pregnancy was pretty much off limits, because we just can’t feel confident in it until a living baby results. I do still wish we could have waited longer, but it wound up being an effective way to convey the message without having to have a conversation where we managed anyone else’s feelings.

I just started tearing up at your last sentence. I just want my little girl, too.

The first thing I want to say is: you did nothing wrong. This is not your fault. I hope that you can get some answers from whatever medical workup you're likely going through right now. 

We had a very similar experience at our NT screening ultrasound. Thought we were in the clear--we'd made it through the first trimester with a perfect pregnancy and a perfect little baby! The first words the radiologist said were, ""Oh I don't like the look of this, aeb."" I weirdly (and somewhat pathetically, honestly) went into doctor mode (I'm a med student) and started asking her all these medical questions. It wasn't until my husband reached over and took my hand that I crumbled into tiny pieces. I've been trying to pick up those pieces ever since. I'm slowly putting them back together, but I'm nowhere near finished. And even once they're back together again, they're not going to be in the same order as before. What I went through, what you went through, what everyone here went through...it's life changing. I wish none of us had these experiences. But I truly believe that the changes we've all experienced/are experiencing aren't all negative. These losses make us all stronger, more compassionate, more empathic, and more courageous people. 

I also had similar encounters with less-than-sympathetic front desk people. My D&E kept getting rescheduled because they wanted to wait for the karyotype before proceeding with it (for medical-legal reasons, no doubt). Every time I got called to reschedule, this woman kept acting as though I was rescheduling a fucking haircut. The DAY BEFORE the procedure: *cheery voice* ""Hi this is K---- from ------, just calling because your karyotype isn't back yet so unfortunately we're going to have to reschedule your procedure!"" I don't really fault her. She's not trained to know how to handle these situations or to understand the medical significance of these procedures, tests, etc. But you'd think someone working at a maternal-fetal medicine office would adopt a slightly more appropriate tone--she's *only* talking to women with high-risk pregnancies. This just added to the general feeling that I was in this bizarro-world version of my life, walking through a hall of mirrors, where up meant down and down meant up, and no one around me was aware that anything had changed.

Looking back at how we acted during the pregnancy--I feel kind of stupid. Announcing to family and friends shortly before the loss, thinking everything was okay. Allowing myself only two sips of champagne on NYE because I wanted to be safe for the baby. Diligently avoiding any makeup or skincare products with even a *whiff* of ingredients that might be harmful to baby. I'm not saying I regret acting this way, but it feels awfully foolish/pathetic looking back and knowing the outcome. I tried, you tried, we all tried really hard. And things still turned out the way they did.

Anyway...I'm so sorry you're here, but I hope you find as much comfort and support in this sub as I have. I see from your flair that you had your D&C yesterday. I hope you're feeling okay so far.

It's hard to find support for pregnancy after loss.

I'm sure you know this, but I'll say it anyway - I think everything you're feeling is normal. I'm 7 weeks pregnant after seven first and second trimester losses and I am all over the place emotionally. It is very strange to be pregnant again. I'm excited and trying to be hopeful, but being pregnant is also bringing up grief for the other babies we've lost and so much anxiety.

Have you called your doctor about the nausea? I just talked to my doctor about this yesterday. I was reluctant to consider medication because I worry about the baby, but my doctor was able to recommend a few medications that have been extensively studied in pregnant women and have not been shown to have any effect on miscarriage, stillbirth, birth defects, or other complications. We also talked about the benefits of treating morning sickness for me and the baby. Like you said, it's really hard to stay hydrated and eat anything while overwhelmed by nausea. Not to mention that it's miserable! After just one day on the new medicine, I am SO HAPPY I asked about it. It is such a relief to feel a little bit better.

I think it's also ok to not be up to normal productivity right now. I know I am not - I'm not working and I'm spending most of the day sleeping and relaxing.

We lost our son to stillbirth just over a year ago, and right now you are really in the trenches and it sucks and is so hard.

We have been seeing a counselor this entire time, usually weekly, with a few weeks off here and there when scheduling conflicts arise, etc. Our therapist is a social worker primarily working with families and couples who have experienced perinatal loss— miscarriage or stillbirth at any stage of pregnancy and some infant loss cases as well. 

She does take insurance, but does not accept our provider. We pay out of pocket and then file a claim with our an insurance company and get reimbursed. It’s a cumbersome process, but given her specialty, we’re comfortable with it as we continue to see her.

My husband and I typically go together, but I often go alone when my husband can’t get out of work or whatever. (I am a stay at home parent to our toddler so I tend to have more flexibility.) I get a lot out of both types of sessions, and I suspect if my husband were more willing to go solo, he would feel the same way, but he is reticent to go on his own. 

I would start by looking at which providers your insurance covers, because that will just make some paperwork easier for you as you move forward. If any of these providers specialize in this type of loss, that would be ideal, but someone who deals with grief would work as well.

But I’ve been TTC #1 for a year and have instead come out with 2 losses. I also keep doing the “well at least I’ll probably have a baby/be pregnant by (insert unimportant milestone that I make important in my head)” and then that comes and passes and then I still have nothing. It just dawned on me last night that I’ve been stuck for a year and it feels like I haven’t done or changed anything due to thinking I might be pregnant or have a baby when... so, I don’t have an answer to your question, but I personally would like to try to just live my life and make the best decisions with the information I have possible right now.

This is not melodramatic at all. This is exactly how I feel about my cat (side note: I hate that it sounds so much more sad when someone feels that way about a cat than about a dog...). I felt close to tears when I got my negative pregnancy test yesterday morning, but then I opened our bedroom door and saw this cute furry face looking up at me and making little happy chirping noises. I couldn't help but smile. 

I like the idea of getting a dog because a) I want to grow our family (and clearly it's not going to happen the way we thought it would--at least, not any time soon), b) I grew up with dogs and it's a life goal of mine to have one of my own, and c) as much as I love my cat, it makes me sad that I can't take him out running, hiking, etc. I do worry that the cat and dog wouldn't get along, though--that's one of the other big things stopping me. My husband always reminds me of this whenever I start talking about getting a dog again; he says that even if the cat and dog get along, our cat would never be as happy and relaxed as he is now. This is probably true.

Do you feel like your career is incompatible because of the lifestyle/hours? I worry about that with mine, too. On the one hand, I buy in to the Sheryl Sandberg school of thought that people shouldn't make career choices in anticipation of having kids--she says this often leads to women hemming themselves into jobs they don't actually like that much, and so they're more likely to leave the workforce altogether once they do have kids. She thinks it's better to just go after the job you love and then worry about making it work later. I guess this is what I've been doing so far. But on the other hand, some careers make it *a lot* easier to ""make it work."" And part of me worries that down the line, I'll have hemmed myself into a career where I don't have this kind of flexibility. 

This conversation came up with a superior of mine the other day. He was telling me that I should seriously consider going into dermatology (his specialty) instead of heme/onc (the specialty I'd like to do) because the lifestyle is a lot better. I appreciate this advice, and it's obviously important to consider. But I always bristle when a man tells me this is something I need to consider ""as a woman."" In any case, it made me start second-guessing my desire to go into heme/onc--balancing my career with having a family and being a mom is something I've fretted about since I was a teenager. And I was *just* on the verge of recapitulating this crisis...when suddenly, I realized: *I shouldn't make any career changes based on hypothetical children.* In the past, my angst about ""work-life balance"" was always premised on the assumption that I'd be able to have kids *and* that I'd have some control over *when* I'd have kids. I planned and plotted and played out hypothetical scenarios, and finally we decided that we should have a baby some time in our last year and a half of med school. I thought I was being pretty conservative with the 1.5 year window--most people can get pregnant within 1.5 years, and my only concern was that we might get pregnant too soon and have the baby earlier than we wanted. HA. HA. HA. Anyway, joke's on me, and this was a terrible way to learn that I shouldn't make any hard and fast plans based on my reproductive organs. But then again, it's hard (and somewhat unrealistic) to abandon these considerations altogether...

Anyway, I guess this is why I'm starting to think maybe we shouldn't prioritize doing residency in New England. If there are programs/cities we prefer elsewhere, maybe we should just go for it and worry about childcare later, if it even comes to that. We need to submit our applications in September, so we'll have to make some decisions before then. But residency is this weird ""match"" process where you rank the programs you like most and they rank the applicants they like most, and then this weird algorithm ""optimizes"" the mutual rank lists. We don't need to submit our rank lists until early next year, so we have until then to *really* make decisions about where we want to be. I'm hoping by then, we'll have more information about how realistic getting pregnant again is (my OB told us to see her if we still aren't pregnant in 6 months, and that will be in September). But damn. I wish I were just in a stable career so that I wouldn't have to make so many decisions in the face of this uncertainty.

Please keep me updated on what you end up deciding with your career, too!",[],,t1_dzdypz9,False,0,[],False,"<div class=""md""><p>Sorry, turns out this reply became way longer than it needed to be...</p>

<p>This is not melodramatic at all. This is exactly how I feel about my cat (side note: I hate that it sounds so much more sad when someone feels that way about a cat than about a dog...). I felt close to tears when I got my negative pregnancy test yesterday morning, but then I opened our bedroom door and saw this cute furry face looking up at me and making little happy chirping noises. I couldn&#39;t help but smile. </p>

<p>I like the idea of getting a dog because a) I want to grow our family (and clearly it&#39;s not going to happen the way we thought it would--at least, not any time soon), b) I grew up with dogs and it&#39;s a life goal of mine to have one of my own, and c) as much as I love my cat, it makes me sad that I can&#39;t take him out running, hiking, etc. I do worry that the cat and dog wouldn&#39;t get along, though--that&#39;s one of the other big things stopping me. My husband always reminds me of this whenever I start talking about getting a dog again; he says that even if the cat and dog get along, our cat would never be as happy and relaxed as he is now. This is probably true.</p>

<p>Do you feel like your career is incompatible because of the lifestyle/hours? I worry about that with mine, too. On the one hand, I buy in to the Sheryl Sandberg school of thought that people shouldn&#39;t make career choices in anticipation of having kids--she says this often leads to women hemming themselves into jobs they don&#39;t actually like that much, and so they&#39;re more likely to leave the workforce altogether once they do have kids. She thinks it&#39;s better to just go after the job you love and then worry about making it work later. I guess this is what I&#39;ve been doing so far. But on the other hand, some careers make it <em>a lot</em> easier to &quot;make it work.&quot; And part of me worries that down the line, I&#39;ll have hemmed myself into a career where I don&#39;t have this kind of flexibility. </p>

<p>This conversation came up with a superior of mine the other day. He was telling me that I should seriously consider going into dermatology (his specialty) instead of heme/onc (the specialty I&#39;d like to do) because the lifestyle is a lot better. I appreciate this advice, and it&#39;s obviously important to consider. But I always bristle when a man tells me this is something I need to consider &quot;as a woman.&quot; In any case, it made me start second-guessing my desire to go into heme/onc--balancing my career with having a family and being a mom is something I&#39;ve fretted about since I was a teenager.

It is devastating to lose a child and 6 weeks is forever and no time at all when it comes to grief. 

From a practical perspective, it seems unlikely that you are pregnant from a single act of intercourse, especially when you are only 6 weeks postpartum and three weeks from the loss of your daughter. Of course there's always a chance and I'm sure it is impossible not to worry about it.

I don't think there's a right or wrong answer to the question of how open to pregnancy you and your husband should be. I also don't think there's any ""easy"" way to manage fertility after such a horrible loss. My husband and I lost our son in the 2nd trimester and afterwards avoiding pregnancy seemed unbearable and so painful, but I know other couples who lost their babies at the same time who really wanted to avoid pregnancy for a time. One thing we found helpful was remembering that openness to pregnancy exists on a spectrum and isn't just a binary decision to try to conceive or strictly avoid pregnancy. It's ok to have ambivalent or mixed feelings.

I think it's  also helpful to have a good team of people there for support, no matter what happens with avoiding/achieving pregnancy. For me, having a good relationship with my doctor, an online support group, and some close friends who have lost babies has been extremely helpful. My husband and I also saw a therapist who specializes in baby loss for a few sessions. Maybe it would be helpful to think about what sort of support you need right now and what sort of support you would like to have in place before trying to conceive again?

The details of my experience and others are there.  For other women, D&E is the better option, medically and mentally.  Do what feels best for you.

After my loss, reading other people's stories helped me a lot.  [Ending a Wanted Pregnancy](https://endingawantedpregnancy.com/)  had a lot of helpful material (and they have a private Facebook support group). 

Our hospital gave us  [*A Time to Decide A Time to Heal*](https://www.amazon.com/Time-Decide-Heal-Difficult-Decisions/dp/1878526391), and our library had [*The Prenatal Bombshell*](https://www.amazon.com/Prenatal-Bombshell-Continuing-Pregnancy-Diagnosis-ebook/dp/B00Y2A3JXE). Both are helpful, non-judgmental guides for navigating this type of loss. The former is a short quick read that my husband and I did together. The latter is a more detailed book that covers everything including TFMR, perinatal hospice, having a child with disabilities, and what comes after these things.  

Our hospital also connected us with a bereavement counselor who we/I have seen monthly (free). And we've also gone regularly to a parent support group for general perinatal loss. (The closest one specifically for TFMR is 2 hrs away from us, but you might live closer to one.)

I hope you and your husband take care of yourselves and each other this coming week.

<p>We have to submit our applications in September, so this decision making actually has to happen pretty soon. But the more we talk about sticking around for childcare reasons, and the more BFNs I get...the more pathetic I feel. It makes me feel like I have this make believe baby that I&#39;m trying to dress up and feed and rock to sleep. Kind of like those old women with dementia in nursing homes who are soothed when they have baby dolls to take care of.</p>

<p>I get that the statistics suggest that we&#39;ll probably be able to have kids eventually. And that means it probably <em>is</em> most practical to continue making plans as if we&#39;ll need child care. But for some reason, that doesn&#39;t make me feel any less pathetic.</p>

Well, if you’ve never been in a Karmann Ghia, they are TINY. It’s very similar to a Beetle, but the seats are even lower. I can barely get in and out of my winter car (a Honda Accord), and I knew I wouldn’t be driving the Ghia still pregnant because it would just be impossible.

But more than that, I was sad about the car show near me today because I was originally going to be induced at or before 39 weeks, so I didn’t think I’d be free and able to go. BUT I AM. I just ate breakfast and remembered it’s car show day!

I’m sad I’m not showing, but I don’t have the energy to show right now. And one of my best friends just got back from a work trip and was gonna come hang out today. She’s also big into cars, and I texted her to meet me there, lol.

Why?  I'm not sure I'd be able to go through taking the 50/50 roll of the dice.  It didn't help that our son's condition can't be diagnosed until 18-19 weeks at the earliest ('cause I'm not comfortable with CVS), so recurrence would mean another later loss.  Plus, our health insurance has some fertility benefits.  I'm also over 35, so we're at a point where we'd have some savings, if we needed to use it, and I'd also be worried about the ""starting over"" that much older, if we'd had another loss.  That was our thinking.

In our case, they didn't find evidence that we were carriers, so that lowers our recurrence risk.  It's not possible to absolutely rule out somatic or germline mosaicism, i.e. when the genetic change happens in the parent during development, such that most cells are normal, but some of cells--specifically those that make up their ovarian or testicle tissue--carry the genetic change.  So we're looking at something like a 1 in 100 to 1 in 1000 chance of recurrence--if my husband or I are a mosaic carrier.  

That risk combined with our risks for things like trisomies put us at about a 1 in 50 chance of another genetic issue occurring.  Those odds aren't wonderfully reassuring, but felt like something we could handle, so we decided to try a natural conception.  *If* lightning strikes twice, and we get a recurrence of my son's condition, we'll definitely move to PGS.  In the meantime, I'm just sitting here concerned about what those genetic results will turn out to be.

There was another TFMR mom here who I think has recurrence risk similar to yours (25%), and she was saying recently that due to their finances and the way their insurance worked, they were going to try naturally one more time before moving to PGS.

I imagine it depends on people's losses too.  Did they get a diagnosis? Is it genetic?  If so, can it be screened for?  What is the recurrence risk?

Our son's condition was diagnosed, so it's something they can screen for.  At this point, if we have another loss, the highest risk thing is miscarriage.  Since I'm over 35, the next biggest risk is aneuploidies.  And then there's the recurrence risk for my son's condition.  And then there's everything else.  

At the same time, no one considers me ""high risk"", so I'm just being treated like any other pregnancy.  There's nothing I can do other than to keep doing what I'm doing and wait.  I wasn't totally at ease the first time around--we waited until the 20-wk anatomy scan was healthy to announce to anyone.  But this time, I know even more about what can go wrong, so I'm slightly more on edge.  It's always kind of in the back of my mind.   

But I'm not looking forward to all the testing--the day I got my son's results back was the worst day of my life (that, and the day he died, are tied for worst), so not looking forward to starting over and doing it all again.  All the results won't be in until week 20 or 21, if all goes well, so it's kind of a long road for us.  But I'm glad it's something that can be screened for--some people don't have that.

Our genetic counselor told us we could keep the same care team, or if that was triggering, we could start over with new providers.  Since our team was generally sensitive and responsive, and since I didn't want to have to bring a bunch of new people up to speed on our history, we're keeping most of them.

Maybe he'll be open to it and want to help name them.  Maybe his feelings won't have changed, and you'll just name the babies for yourself.  Either way is okay.

Dieting, exercise, and weight loss does not have the same effect for every woman. There is a lot of research that show that moderate weight loss improves fertility for women who are overweight or obese. Even a very modest loss of 5, 10 or 15 pounds can improve insulin sensitivity and hormonal levels. Similarly, I remember there being a study of overweight and normal weight women and various levels of exercise which found that vigorous exercise improved the fertility of overweight women, but decreased the fertility of normal-weight women.

When dieting, exercise, or weight loss effects fertility, you can typically see the effects if a woman is charting. Things to look for would be delayed ovulation, decreased cervical mucus, or shorter luteal phases. If you noticed these things, you could reevaluate your plans. 

Edit: I second everyone else's suggestions to consider a ""slow and steady"" approach that you can continue during pregnancy.

Various forms of stress (like severe dieting) can, too.  I'm sure you know that.

And you're right: the metabolic responses after a rapid, substantial weight loss can be really complicated.  Additional serious restrictions risk triggering that same compensatory ""starvation"" metabolic response...  So, I'm hesitant to say ""X will do this"" or ""Y will do that"".

20 lbs. over 7 months, is pretty slow gain--like 1.5 oz. per day.  If I was in your place--trying for a pregnancy, concerned about ovulatory and metabolic responses to dieting, I would consider trying a ""moderate"" approach again.

The challenge is that it would take a while (1) to lose the weight, and (2) just to know if it's starting to work.   If I lost 1.5 oz. per day, I wouldn't notice for a while.  It would take a month just to lose 2.5-3 lbs., and since 1-2 lbs. of fluctuation in weight is normal for me, it would *feel* like nothing was different.  And it might be hard to stay motivated if after 2 months, it felt like I'd barely lost anything.  

Instead of ""dieting"" per se, my husband and I have started focusing more on habits.  Heart disease runs in my family, so we've started adopting the recommendations: less red meat, some meals vegetarian, fruit/veggies at all three meals, smaller portions of meat (they say ""deck of cards"" i.e. 3 oz., but I do 4 oz. 'cause it's easier for stuff sold by the lb.--still better than the 8+ oz. servings I grew up with...), no more than one meal out per week (including lunches), only a limited amount of junk food comes in the house each week--and when it's eaten, that's it until the next week...the list goes on.  

It's taken time (years!) to adopt these habits, one by one.  To find new recipes I liked, and a different way to do meal planning. And there's still room for improvement. But now I feel like we're set up for better health, and it's all on autopilot now.  

It's not a strategy for losing 20 lbs. in 3 or 4 months...But it is a strategy for moving to a new equilibrium over time--and one that is good for TTC (vitamins! folate!), and safe for continuing during pregnancy (if the TTC is successful before you're at where you'd like to be).  

Also, I get that with a goal to lose weight soon, you don't want a to get a new wardrobe, but there's no harm in buying yourself a couple cute things that make you feel sexy *now*.

It's one of several papers from of Enrique Schisterman's [EAGeR dataset](https://www.nichd.nih.gov/about/org/diphr/officebranch/eb/effects-aspirin) (on the efficacy of baby aspirin for improving live birth rates).  

Based on their protocol, there's a some wiggle when translating the numbers they report, but for couples TTC again 0-3 months post-loss, the breakdown is roughly:  

- 17% (1 in 6) were pregnant by cycle #3  
- 34% (1 in 3)  were pregnant by cycle #5
- 51% (1 in 2) were pregnant by cycle #8
- 68% (2 in 3)  were pregnant by cycle #9
- 32% (1 in 3) were NOT pregnant by cycle #9

Women weren't followed for more than 9 cycles post loss, so there's no info on how things went for those couples.  

The numbers for the group that waited longer are a little worse, but that's not necessarily something to stress about.  Because of the question the study was trying to answer, the group that waited longer mixed women that waited 4 months with women that waited 12+ months, and since MC and age go together, the longer waits might have had an influence.  Also the group that waited longer tended to be (a) slightly older (women and men), (b) more likely to smoke, (c) more likely to be diagnosed as subfertile, (d) more likely to consume alcohol, (e) slightly heavier, and (f) more likely to have had a miscarriage at a later gestational age...So even though this group had longer time to pregnancy/fewer pregnancies, it might have been due these other factors, not the WTT per se. 

Beyond that they didn't break down outcomes by type of loss.  But in the study population, stillbirths were excluded (in the US, that's losses after 20wks, which includes many cases of cervical insufficiency).  They report 99.8% of women in the study had a last loss of ≤19 weeks gestation, with 54.1% those being losses at ≤8 weeks.  Also, roughly half the women in the study were on baby aspirin (the point of the study), and that was found to improve time to pregnancy, so you can think about that too when thinking about how this applies to you.

Which a lot of ladies on this subreddit practice.

But those women weren't recovering from MC.  In general, their cycles were more likely regular and healthy from the start.  Unlike here, where bodies take time to get back to normal.  

The German study's aim was ""illustrating an ideal of human fertility potential.""  They selected only highly educated couples, and gave them ""experienced NFP teachers"" to work with for 3-6 months.  None of the, ""I thought I ovulated, but my temp isn't up and now I'm confused"" stuff that's common for folks here.

And cycles where they didn't have sex during the fertile window (according to this highly coached determination of the FW) were excluded.  Unlike here, where when there's uncertainty, we're still more likely to count it as a cycle we tried.  

The [paper I was referencing](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4780347/) was looking at time to pregnancy after miscarriage, to determine if common advice to ""wait 3 cycles"" was necessary.  So post-loss women were categorized into two groups, those that waited 0-3 months (not cycles) to start TTC, and everyone else.  

Time to pregnancy and live birth outcomes were actually better for those who started TTC <= 3 months post-loss.  I tend to use those numbers because they're easier for translating from quantiles into cumulative pregnancy rates by cycle.  And the median time to pregnancy is just 1 cycle different.

Couples in the Schliep paper probably weren't all practicing NFP.  Frequency of sex varied.  They didn't track women's fertile windows and timing of sex.  To me, this makes is a more realistic picture of real couples figuring out post-loss TTC, relative to the German study where they were all tracking cycles under ideal conditions and had instructors for 3-6 months...but YMMV.

It&#39;s like a coin flip--you may get heads 5 times in a row but over enough trials, it will be roughly 50/50. </p>

He's just like, ""Okay, we'll try again next month."" Hahaha...he just lets me spin my wheels.

I sometimes regret having my husband get an SA after 6 months. I guess it made sense at the time...and I still feel like it was reasonable in hindsight. But the way things went, my husband had 2 SAs with low sperm count followed by another SA with a more reasonable sperm count (but still slightly on the lower end of normal) + low morphology. The urologist ended up saying that he didn't have any issues--that everything was normal. He said the two low sperm counts were a blip and representative of normal variation (okay), and he said the morphology metric is stupid because the criteria are too strict (okay). While I respected his opinion, I did *not* like this guy. He had a very ""don't worry your pretty little head"" attitude, typical of most white men of a certain age. He told us not to worry and that we'd probably get pregnant in the next month or two. Of course this really grated on me at the time--it felt dismissive and invalidating.

...

And then I got pregnant the next month. Obviously, I was thrilled. But a small part of me was pissed off that that asshole was right after all...

Anyway, I guess if we'd just gotten pregnant after 7 months of trying, with no testing, I might be less nervous this time around. 7 months is a totally reasonable amount of time and not at all indicative of a problem on its own. But now we've had those few abnormal SAs, and even thought the urologist was unconcerned, I can't help but feel that it means we're going to take a *very* long time to get pregnant again. And I also can't help but link my husband's low morphology to our daughter's aneuploidy...even though I can't find any convincing data to back this up. I feel a little crazy (and a little guilty) for thinking this way, but I guess this is just what the human brain does: we try to connect the dots, especially when something unexpected/random and terrible happens. We want to make sense of things, because it's too uncomfortable to just accept the randomness.

It's hard trying to reconcile the idea of future living children with the child or children you have lost. One thing that helped me was to think about the way parents with multiple living children handle this. Having more children doesn't in any way negate or reduce your love for your previous children. It is the same with children you have lost. Regardless of whether you and your husband have another child, Audrey will always be your little girl and you will always love her and you will always remember her.

I'll share one last story with you. After our son passed, I was the one who called and told our families. When I called my grandmother, she immediately started crying and told me she was so sorry and shared with me her own story of loss, which I didn't know about. In 1952 she carried to term a little boy, Richard, who lived for only a few days due to spina bifida. In 1953 she had a second stillborn child around 6 months. My dad was born in 1954 and my uncle a few years after. And in 2015 when my son died, despite the fact that 63 years had passed and she'd had two healthy children her love for Richard and her other little one was still strong enough, still raw enough that it brought her to tears when she comforted me over the loss of my own boy.

I also felt the same way the month we got pregnant with our daughter--it was our 7th cycle, and our RE had told us to try naturally for another 3 months before diving in to IVF (my husband had had a few concerning SAs). I viewed those three months as doing our due diligence--time we had to put in in order to convince ourselves and our RE that we needed IVF.

I feel like it makes sense that we do this. Classic self-preservation. Set your expectations low so that you'll protect against being disappointed if it doesn't work out, but you'll be pleasantly surprised if it does.

She said she was glad that my midwife-- the one that delivered Sam-- is going to be the one there when this baby is born. I gather that she has a reputation in the office for being the one that has the best resonance with loss cases. What a sad thing to have distinguish your work, although for my own sake I am grateful to have her. 

I also had a NST at MFM this morning. Next week's visit will include growth measurements. This week everything looked quite normal-- the baby is still transverse but I'm having a csection anyways so whatever. 

The other day I mentioned that my husband's parents never reached out to him on Sam's first birthday. A couple days later his mom sent him a text (unprompted, as far as I know) apologizing for failing to recognize what a tough week last week was for us. It mollified him a bit that she had seemed to realize on her own that she had effed up, but I know he's still upset that she could have forgotten in the first place. (And so am I.) I also think it's kind of weak that she did that particular bit of outreach in a text-- I think it would have been appropriate to call him and apologize sincerely, and accept whatever enraged disappointment he wanted to share with her. But she never calls him-- I think its some old fashioned thing where she does not believe she should have to call her adult children, but that they should call her. So if she wants to talk to him she will text him to call her. I'm completely confused as to why she doesn't just acknowledge that the phone works both ways, and so do attempts at relationship maintenance. 

Today I pounded out a very long email that I'll never send to my inlaws, just describing some of what we have been through and how it has made us feel and the ways in which they've dropped the ball on being a supportive presence. Just spitting it all out on paper helped me kind of release some of my angst, but I did tell my husband that if he is going to have a tough conversation with his parents over his disappointment about the way they didn't acknowledge Sam's birthday, he needs to do it sooner rather than later. We're 16 days from my scheduled csection and his parents don't know yet that we have it scheduled-- we're fine with calling them after the birth to share the news-- only my parents get a heads' up, and that's because they're going to be watching our LC while we're at the hospital. I think that I want to put as much distance as we can between this unpleasant but necessary conversation, and the conversation where he calls his parents with news about the new baby-- just so there's a little bit of buffer time for relations to kind of ""normalize"" so we don't feel so resentful if we have a healthy baby and they (reasonably) want to like, come up and meet her. It won't help anyone for us to still be stewing over Sam's birthday if we have something to celebrate, if that makes any sense. 

Andddd on that note, I wish I could have a fetal monitor on my belly at all times until I go under the knife. Also, while I'm wishing for things, I wouldn't mind if they just gave me my catheter now. Peeing this constantly is getting so tiresome.

I went to Target looking for some basic maternity jeans in a state of emergency yesterday. I was down to just 1 pair of pants that fit comfortably. Preferably dark wash, boot cut jeans or black dress pants I could wear to the office. What did I find?

Distressed and cutoff jeans everywhere! Maternity activewear! Teeny tiny maternity booty shorts I wouldn't have worn even pre-pregnancy! 

Not one single workplace appropriate style of pants or jeans. It was very disappointing.

So I tried the consignment store down the street, and hit the jackpot - tops, dress pants, workplace-appropriate jeans - all for $5-7 each and in fabulous condition. Score. 

However, a lot of pieces in there still had original tags on them and my first worry was how many of these were brought here because someone bought everything super early and then lost their baby? Maybe I'm just hormonal, but I bawled my eyes out in the shop. Brand new 0-3m clothes, receiving blankets, cribs & mattresses, rockers and bouncers, car seats and strollers still in their boxes and plastic...

The doctor I saw is one of two ""A list"" doctors in the US for treating Asherman's, and he said my case was pretty much exactly what he hears from women every day. No one wants to diagnose you with Asherman's, so yes, it goes undiagnosed in many women, for at least several months while doctors tell you to just wait, maybe throw you some Provera (which does nothing). He travels the country educating OBGYNS on Asherman's in the hopes that more women will be listened to and hopefully diagnosed so they can move forward with treatment.

Bottom line, I wish I would've known about scarring risk and Asherman's before I had my d&c. Would I still have had the d&c even knowing the scarring risk? Most likely! Do I wish I had been at least warned (by anyone, doctor, friend, Reddit) before consenting? Yes! Knowledge is power. My intention is absolutely not to scare anyone, ever. I just wish I would've at least known that Asherman's exists before having to deal with having it.

There doesn't seem to be great data on this tea, but according to Google, it's been recommended by midwives for ages. And, like you, I'm a tea drinker, so I figured why the hell not. I've also been drinking nettle leaf tea (the Yogi Women's Nursing Support Tea) because I accidentally bought that instead of the raspberry leaf tea one time. Here's my experience so far:

1. **Raspberry Leaf Tea**: I was relieved to find that this doesn't actually taste fruity at all--it's more like a black tea. It's tasty. In terms of brands, I've tried Yogi and Traditional Medicinals, and I prefer the taste of the latter. In terms of how much it's helped...impossible to say. I've never had a D&E before, so I'm not sure how my body would be behaving otherwise. But so far, I've been overall happy with how quickly my cycle has regulated. It took me 7 weeks after my D&E to get my first period, which was a little lighter than usual but otherwise pretty normal. Then I had a normal cycle that seemed to have been ovulatory (i.e., positive OPK at at time that made sense), followed by a normal period. I'm at 5dpo on my second cycle, and this appears to have been ovulatory as well (i.e., positive OPK and temp bump at a time that made sense). Anyway, hard to say whether the raspberry leaf tea has influenced this or not.

2. **Nettle Leaf Tea**: Accidentally bought the Yogi Women's Nursing Support Tea, which is actually really delicious--soothing and well balanced flavor. Highly recommend just based on taste alone (and I actually normally hate the taste of fennel, one of the other ingredients in this tea, but it's great here). No idea if this is helping, but I'll continue to drink it because it's delicious.

I can't say these teas have worked wonders in terms of fertility--I got a BFN my first cycle trying, and we had pretty great timing that cycle. Then again, it took us 7 cycles to get pregnant the first time, and my husband seems to have a low sperm count (2 SA's with *very* low sperm count, followed by 1 SA with a low-normal sperm count), so all the tea in the world wouldn't be able to fix that. And even if I *had* gotten a BFP my first cycle, I wouldn't be able to say it was the tea that did it.

**tl;dr** Overall, I've enjoyed drinking these teas because a) I like herbal tea, and b) I like feeling like I'm doing something nurturing for my lady parts since we've had a rather antagonistic relationship recently (even if there's basically no evidence that these teas are at all helpful). I say go for it.

At my 8 wk ultrasound there was a very weak heartbeat and the fetus was only measuring at 5 wks. At my follow-up a week later, there had been no growth and the heartbeat was weaker. My doctor confirmed that it would only get weaker. I also wanted to avoid a D&C but I was also on a time limit because I was scheduled to travel for work 6 weeks later. I opted for miso and did pass tissue over the next 48 hrs, but there was still retained tissue when I went for my follow-up. I was warned that since the miso hadn’t worked completely the first try, it likely wouldn’t work for a second attempt but I decided to give it another try before going for the D&C. Absolutely nothing happened with that second dose. Since I had no idea when my body would decide to expel retained tissue (for some people it takes several weeks), I decided to move forward with the D&C. 

Although I don’t necessarily *regret* doing the second round of miso, I do feel like it extended the whole experience that I really just wanted to be done with. The D&C was actually a very “easy” experience, physically and logistically. The surgery center was near my apt, the staff there were absolutely wonderful and made me as calm and comfortable as possible, the procedure was quite fast and I remember nothing after being set up in the surgery room. I had very little bleeding/discomfort after the procedure. At my follow-up, my doctor said that everything looked fine and there should be very little (if any) scarring in the future.

Hopefully the 4th dose does the trick, and you’re done. But really, a D&C isn’t the end of the world. My experience was pretty shitty, but after all that, I got pregnant the very next cycle and am 38+2 today.

<p>The doctor mentioned in the post (JC Prior) has published a few peer-reviewed papers....on menopause.  Menopause!  So on the off-chance one of her papers says something about varying location of breast pain--she&#39;s talking about menopause symptoms. And menopause differs in lots of ways from a normal monthly cycle.  So unless you&#39;re 33 and think you&#39;re going through menopause, this doesn&#39;t apply to you.  </p>

<p>I.e. At best, this is a snake oil saleswoman twisting menopause research to pray on the insecurities of women having trouble getting pregnant in order to sell them god knows what to put in their bodies.  </p>

It’s such a hard road to walk when you are watching your friends get pregnant while you are mourning your baby, but I will say the bulk of my prior friendships are beginning to recover a year later, as I adjust to my new normal and am used to the fact that my friends have started their families in the interim as well. </p>

<p>Also, we live in the Southern United States, and summer has hit hard. We are having 90°F days. I&#39;m feeling big and fat and hot and miserable. And definitely resentful that I have to go through all of this again.</p>

<p>Okay, this is insanely nerdy and I don&#39;t think it even makes any sense now that I&#39;ve typed it out...sorry.</p>

<p>Be gentle on yourself, and take care of yourself.  Healing (physically and mentally) is a marathon, not a sprint.  Hugs.</p>

After our 1st loss, people from all over offered condolences, after awhile, it all started to sound the same. It's not that I was appreciative that people reached out, it's that I was tired of seeing the sad faces, which made me sad. There were days I felt really good, and I'd bump into someone that said something, that then brought up all the emotions again, and I'd have to fight them back. People who have not experienced loss like this, don't fully understand. They'll say things like ""I can't imagine"", I agree with that, you can't, it sucks. But personally, I feel stronger, because of it. However, I wouldn't wish it on anyone.  Like others have said, people avoided me, a coworker had a baby right after my first son. She brought her son in to work, but didn't bring him around me. A close friend who was a co-worker and got a new job didn't even tell me he was having a baby. With all that being said, it gets easier. You'll find your self smiling again, and sometimes feeling guilty because of it. Don't. Enjoy your life, find happiness, at times it can be hard. Support can be found in some unlikely places. The kindness of others is an amazing thing.

With regards to your questions, some of them are tricky to answer openly in light of the sub rules about not speaking about current pregnancies or living children. But there is a weekly ""ask an alumni thread"" where you could ask and receive more open answers.

I can say that I was absolutely desperate to conceive again asap after my loss. I was obsessive about tracking my cycle,, timing sex, etc. We had conceived relatively quickly the first time around (cycle 2), and I expected it to be the same. I was wrong! By the 6 month mark we started early testing and by the 10 month mark we were beginning infertility consultations after my husband's semen analyses came back unexpectedly low. It was a lot to process at a time I was already emotionally depleted. 

I don't regret trying so soon though. I had such an overwhelming sense of empty arms and I acknowledge it was my way of taking control and coping. I didn't see it as disrespectful to Daisy or her memory, because I knew we were trying for a different baby, not to replace her. It did bring up some unexpected angst about gender, because I was so ready to parent a girl and I was so afraid of conceiving a boy. Even though that wasn't something I ever worried about before I knew Daisy was a girl! That angst faded over time.

I will say that about 9 months after my loss, I found this point of contentment / peace where the desperation settled and I could feel happy and enjoy aspects of my life without them being clouded by sadness or angst about conceiving.

It sucks for them, and it sucks that things change, but you will be better off without people like that around you.

My period didn't come back for six weeks after the D&E so this month is our first opportunity to try again.

Add to that my husband travels a lot for work so I was already feeling stressed (even before we miscarried) about completely missing the fertile window due to his travel schedule.

The short of it is that I kind of had a gut feeling that things weren't right after the first ultrasound. After the second ultrasound I had betas done. I checked my online chart after the second draw and saw my levels were dropping, and I knew that instant. That's how I found out myself. Getting it actually confirmed by a doctor was something else completely.  

In the full story, my OB's office hugely miscommunicated things to me basically the whole pregnancy. First, when I called to make an my first appointment the secretary scheduled me for JUST an 8w dating ultrasound. I didn't know anything about the procedures, but I expected that at my first appt I'd get *some* pregnancy info. But nope, just a less than 15 minute appointment where the ultrasound tech/NP told me I measured less than 6 weeks, my dates must be off and to come back in two weeks and try again. I didn't even get my vitals taken! I immediately felt in my gut that the us didn't seem right, but I was hopeful that maybe things were just developing slowly. 

Two weeks later I had another similar us appointment, no vitals taken, no health history asked. This time I still measured at just around 6 weeks. I knew as soon as I saw the screen it was not right, and the tech found no heartbeat. The doctor came in then and told me, not that it was a MMC, no, he said that there was a 50/50 chance of things continuing *normally* from here but ordered betas just to see what was going on!! So, I got the first blood draw. I spent the next week going up and down over it. ""there's a chance!"" vs ""it's a miscarriage."" and finally after my second draw I obsessively checked my online portal all day and when it came in, I saw my hcg down and I knew for sure it was a MMC. 

I waited *two days* for the doctor to call and confirm to me the news, and when I got the call this is what happened: It was some random nurse who called me. She assumed that I had *already had* the miscarriage and the call was just a followup for the blood draw. She said to me something like ""Ok, your levels are going down, so we're just going to have you come in in 10-14 days and make sure they keep dropping. I see you had an ultrasound appointment scheduled here for next week, but I'll just go ahead and cancel that for you, ok?"" I managed to sputter out something like ""Uh... so... what does this mean? I realize that it's a miscarriage but, I haven't actually *had* the miscarriage yet, like, what should I do?? Shouldn't I come in and talk to the doctor?"" and she said, (I kid you not) ""Well, I'll ask him, but I don't think he needs to see you."" After that I just got off the phone with her. I was too stunned to do anything. 

After I got my wits about me, the next day I called back and DEMANDED that I have an appointment with the doctor to go over what was happening to me and what I should do. I got an appointment that afternoon. I finally got it actually *confirmed* by the doctor that it was indeed a missed miscarriage. They were nice enough about it, saying sorry it happened and all that, but all in all, it was not a great experience. I have since switched doctors. I won't go through that BS again.

The weather was beautiful, I had a few moments of relative peace. We got a lot of nice messages that we didn’t really feel an obligation to respond to— I had kind of warned people that I just wanted to hunker down. 

But my husband’s parents didn’t reach out on Saturday to acknowledge that they were thinking of us, or of Sam. His dad had mentioned earlier in the week that he and his sister and mom (as in, husband’s aunt and grandma) had donated a sizable sum of money to a charity in Sam’s name. That definitely counts as acknowledgement in my book, but I know my husband would have liked to actually hear from his dad. Also, his mom (my MIL) wasn’t included in this donation, which I find so odd since my inlaws are married. (Though— long story, they live in different states caring for their aging parents and have a very non-functional marriage, even before my FIL moved down to be with his mom for her health. They very much do not operate as a unit and functionally, my husband and I tend to treat them as a divorced couple. But it’s still not hard to put someone’s name on a gift, especially one you are bestowing verbally... my guess is that it just literally didn’t occur to him to make the gift from him and his wife. I know that sounds insane but it is pretty on brand for my FIL.)

Anyways, my MIL *did* text my husband Saturday to tell him she received the Mother’s Day gift we sent her— a picture frame with some pics of our 3yo. So like, she was alive and texting that day and just... didn’t acknowledge Sam’s birthday. And my husband is so understandably disappointed in both of them, but especially his mother because his dad at least gets partial credit for mentioning the donation earlier in the week.

He has had to have so many painful conversations with his family about how their tendency to whitewash Sam out of our lives makes it harder for him— he feels they forget him, he feels they forget Sam, that they just don’t want to deal with us when the harder aspects of this come out. I know I feel differently about my family; I almost wish they would mention it less because their attempts are so clumsy (and occasionally overly sentimental) that I never know quite how to respond. But I absolutely understand that he feels this way about his parents, and has told them as much, and he still can’t convince them to show some love to their son over the loss of his son. It’s hard for me to observe, as someone who cares for him and even more as someone who mainly feels contempt for my inlaws, even aside from Sam’s loss.

I know that we will have to confront this sooner or later— we are scheduled to have another baby in less than three weeks and I just don’t think that we can silently stew over this in that interim, but I also don’t want to push my husband into dealing with this before he’s ready/figured out how exactly he’d like to handle it to safeguard his own emotional health as much as possible.
