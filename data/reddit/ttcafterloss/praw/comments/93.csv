That almost worked, but a week later I started to bleed again and needed a d&amp;c. Honestly, the d&amp;c was not nearly as bad as I thought it would be. It was not as traumatic as I had anticipated and I felt back to ‚Äúnormal‚Äù physically within a few hours. </p>

<p>The success of cytotec is dependent on many things and one is how long the pregnancy was. This most recent loss I was just shy of 10 weeks. My doctor wasn‚Äôt shocked when I needed a d&amp;c because I was so far along. </p>

<p>My first miscarriage was at 7 weeks and I passed everything naturally in a few days. Only thing I wish I had done was get strong pain meds. I only took Tylenol, and it wasn‚Äôt quite enough.</p>

Firstly, I just want to say that if you haven't yet gotten your period back after your loss, then things are going to be a bit challenging for you in terms of using OPKs, especially re. the CBAD, so let's just focus on the cheapy strips for now.

OK, so with the cheapies, you can afford to just wazz these, so what I would say is if you aren't already, you need to be taking at least one (if you feel up to it, two) every day at around the same time (or times, in the case of two) and keeping the old strips (you can just tape or glue them to a piece of paper) or take a photo in a tracking app like Femometer.

Remember that a positive on an OPK is **only when the test line is as dark as, or darker than, the control**.  Anything else is a negative, but by having your previous tests will allow you to compare the results and give you a better idea of when *your* positive is.  This is because with some ladies, their LH surge is very short/happens at night etc, and so it's easy for it to be missed.

By having your older strips, you should be able to see when things are getting darker, and then lighter again, even if you never get a strip that is as dark as the control.  To be clear, this doesn't mean you didn't ovulate, it could just mean that you missed catching the result.

With the CBAD, you really need to have an idea of your cycle length (so that you can follow the instructions in the leaflet as to when you should start tracking) otherwise you will end up spending an inordinate amount on the sticks.  I would really advise that you wait to have a period before you start with these, but if you want to be a glutton for punishment, if you think you start to see a darkening on the cheapies, you can try supplementing with the CBAD to get a confirmation.

Also, even when using CBAD knowing the length of your cycle, it is normal to have several days of a high result before getting peak, and therefore to use close to a whole box of sticks on one cycle.  With where you are atm, I would encourage you not to waste your CBAD supplies until you've had a period, and just stick with the cheapy OPKs for now.

You mentioned that you are doing BBT tracking; that's great as that can give you some confirmation after the fact that you did ovulate.  As such, if you stick with doing one or two cheapy OPKs every day (there is some discussion about exactly when to do them, but just pick a time(s) that suit you and your schedule) then you will at least have a baseline (as in, you can see whether there was a visible darkening) to call back to if/when you get your temperature spike on your BBT.

Finally, if all else fails, the bottom line is to get sperm in the right place, so provided you can manage it, try and have sex at least every two or three days (the more frequently the better), then your bases will be at least partially covered, for if/when you do ovulate.  If you have the energy, time and inclination, then IMHO this is the best approach, as you aren't relying on waiting to be told by any tracking method, and you are making the most of the time in-between your period resuming, just in case you do ovulate 'silently'.

I would also strongly encourage you to get in and make that doctor's appointment for the hormone panel so that you/they can figure out exactly what's going on, as I would have thought your period should have returned by now (time-frames normally given are between 4-6 weeks after the actual MC event).

I just said to hell with tracking because of everything being such a mess, so I have no idea when/if I ovulated.  However, if I did, I know that we have/are doing everything we can to maximise the situation.  If that doesn&#39;t work, I&#39;ll happily welcome my period and plan to celebrate with something tasty to eat!  I&#39;m hoping it shows up before the 35 day mark.</p>

* I expend my energies on myself; pregnancy is not a zero sum game.  Someone else's success does not have any meaning on my progress, and I do not know the journey they may have taken to get there.
* My body appears to be healthy and functional; I want to focus on the forward path of trying again and hopefully having a successful outcome next time.  I reward my body with good eating and exercise.

We've had some. Everything looks good for me except I have the MTHFR gene but that's widely debated if it's causation or correlation for miscarriages. My doctor has me taking a daily baby aspirin and I have the best prenatal vitamins money can buy, chock full of folate and I'm eating food items heavy in it as well.

My husband OTOH has a pericentric inversion of his 10th chromosome. Gives us a 5% increase miscarriage risk than average and an increased risk of having special needs children. Our genetic counselor and perinatal specialist said that the risk is so marginal though they are both encouraging us to ""keep trying the old fashioned way"" before we move on to sperm donation or IVF.

We don't know what caused the first miscarriage. The second one my daughter had Turner syndrome which has a 97% miscarriage rate. Genetic Counselor said that was a fluke that just happens sometimes for no reason and we just got ""really unlucky."" Another reason they want us to just keep trying.

I had Noah the 27/3 at 36w. We decided to terminate because during a routine exam they found he had a severe brain malformation.

Unfortunately I don‚Äôt quite remember the names of all the medicines, but hopefully I can share a positive birth experience.

On the Tuesday we went to hospital to stop Noah‚Äôs heart so he wouldn‚Äôt suffer. They numbed the area for the needle and although it wasn‚Äôt pleasant, physically for me was less painful than the amnio. After the procedure they gave me the first pill to soften the cervix and sent me home until Thursday.

Thursday morning I was booked to go into hospital at 8 in the morning and there we went. I was told I would take a pill every 6 hours until birth and that the first one would be vaginal, but all others orally.

I was given paracetamol all day; only around 1am I asked for something stronger and was given an injection of pethidine that made me a bit drowsy, but it was supposed to help me sleep and relax, which in turn should help dilate (I was checked then and was barely at 2cm). I was given the pill once more at that time.

The midwife that was taking care of me at that point went for her break thinking it would still take hours (spoiler alert: it didn‚Äôt). My contractions started and I asked my hubby to time them.

This is when everything happened really quickly. I remember telling my husband to call the midwife and when she came in I said I was in pain and wanted an epidural. She checked me and said ‚ÄòI don‚Äôt think we have time for that, but I‚Äôll get the anaesthetist‚Äô. Meanwhile she gave me gas and air (more drowsiness). The anaesthetist came quickly, but agreed it was too late for an epidural and suggested oral morphine instead. I wasn‚Äôt too sure because it was supposed to make me even more drowsy but I said yes and got ready to push.

Pushing felt very natural and out of my control, it was as if my body took over. Noah was born at 2.57am and I delivered the placenta shortly after having an injection to help with it (I barely pushed). I had no tears and was given a couple of stitches on a laceration to avoid discomfort.

A bit after that the midwife brought Noah in a little cot so we could meet him.

By 5am I was walking around the ward looking for some juice because I was thirsty.

Besides the horrible emotional experience, the physical one was much better than I could have hoped for. I was discharged that same afternoon and at my 6 week postnatal appointment this week the Dr said that I healed very well.

I also have an induced L&D birth story at 22+3, and I was going to refer you to my posts, but my birth story was posted in my bumper group. (Sorry that it‚Äôs so long, I wrote it just after we said goodbye to our daughter).

We went into the hospital at 6:30AM on Feb 18, 2020 to become induced. I had to take mifepristone 24 hours prior in order to begin blocking pregnancy hormones and preparing my cervix. This was so incredibly emotionally difficult, as I felt I was the one who had to begin the process. It was a lot to mentally deal with that day, as we continued to live our life in limbo, trying to cherish our time with our girl, yet trying to prepare ourselves for what was to come. The day before inducing was hands down the worst day of my life. 

Around 7:20AM on the 18th is when I began to receive misoprostol tablets that were inserted into my cervix manually every 4 hours. Honestly - EFF OUCH!! Within 40 minutes, I began to cramp, which I was told was a good sign, but caused an immense amount of constant pain. I finally asked for pain meds around 10, and received a very small dose of a fentanyl drip that I could self-administer every 5 minutes. This genuinely helped keep the constant cramping ‚Äúat bay‚Äù for 1-2 hours, before the next dosage began to kick in. It was like terribly painful period cramps all day long. My amazing nurse upped the dosages as the day went along and the pain increased.

The exhaustion, hunger, fentanyl, and pain, caused me to be incredibly nauseous numerous times, despite a few different medicinal nausea reliefs (no idea what they were, as I was so out of it). My pain continued on, never ‚Äúwaxing‚Äù or ‚Äúwaning‚Äù as in typical labour contractions, and I was continuously told this was good it was happening so quickly. Things were progressing better than they hoped. Around 4:00 is when things began to really ramp up for me and the contractions started coming. My water broke at 5:00 and that‚Äôs when I finally felt relief for the first time all day. I was scared because I didn‚Äôt know when it would happen and what it would feel like. This was my first pregnancy and first delivery, so I absolutely no clue what to do. I hadn‚Äôt prepared for birth because I wasn‚Äôt prepared mentally to give birth after 5 months. Even in this induced situation, my body knew it was just about time when I randomly snapped at my mother to leave the room because it was time. I had a handful of major ‚Äútypical‚Äù contractions that came and went. After two pushes, our daughter arrived sleeping just after 5:30. We don‚Äôt think she took a breath earth-side, but we did see some reflex movements.

We had some time together to hold her and take photos before we became concerned that my placenta wasn‚Äôt going to come naturally. My husband cried when he held her, and I was in the largest state of shock. In the 6 days from the more complete diagnosis until her birth, I was an emotional, weeping, shell of myself. But with the rush of hormones, pain, exhaustion, joy of meeting my daughter, hunger, pain meds, and maternal instinct to carry forward and nurture above it all, I was just in complete shock. Almost numb to all of it and didn‚Äôt cry once that day. Which is the furthest from how I ever am. I am happy, though, that I was able to stay calm and completely enjoy our time together. 

My doctor tried to remove my placenta manually (oh my god... so painful), and he was able to get half of it. He left us for a bit in the hopes the rest would come. 

Our nurse was absolutely phenomenal the entire day - from my care, our daughter‚Äôs delivery, and her care afterwards. I‚Äôm so grateful for her during this impossible time. She took photos of us, weighed, and measured our little girl. She broke 1lb! 1lb 1oz. She was so tiny, but so big in our eyes. We got a cute little knit hat for her and some keepsake items (matching hearts, memory box, and she helped do the footprints and handprints). We got to spend a few hours with our little girl just cuddling and admiring her. Gushing over how perfect she is to us.

Our doctor returned and he decided he wanted to move me to another room with more instruments to remove the rest of the placenta. He basically performed a D&C ‚Äúwithout performing one‚Äù to get the rest of it, discovered a tear in my cervix, and repaired it all right there. My body had experienced so much pain already and I just felt like it would never end. 

I got to come back to our little girl and spend a little bit more time with her before my doctor came back and told me he was concerned about the tear and wanted to make sure he got all the placenta. He wanted to perform a full D&C to be safe. This meant I only had 45 minutes left with our little girl. We were only allowed 4 hours with her, as they said it would be an infection issue after that point and they could need to place her somewhere cool for any additional time. I wish we had the cuddlecots I know they have in the UK.

I said my goodbye to my sweet girl, kissed her one last time, and left her with her piece of the heart and the matching momma bunny stuffy I had been cuddling for the last several days and with her. We took the matching baby bunny stuffy home and I cuddle it all the time. The D&C happened so quickly for me as I was sedated and woke up in what seemed like seconds later. Everything seemed to go well, I slowly came out of that anesthesia, and my husband and went back to our empty room. I actually ended up having 2 cervical tears instead of 1, so I‚Äôm glad my doctor pushed for a full D&C to discover and repair it, too.

My husband and I slept as it was 11:30PM by that point and we had been awake since 5:00AM. We slept for about an hour before my final check and clearance to go home. It was all over. Leaving the hospital without our little girl was devastating. How our lives changed so drastically in 14 day‚Äôs time...

I‚Äôm now 11.5 weeks out from saying hello and goodbye to our daughter. I occasionally get thrown back to the earlier, dark days, but generally the intensity of it all has lessened. I think of our daughter all the time and it still hurts. But I‚Äôm also able to smile and be so incredibly happy for the time that we did have with her.

Edited to include a few more details.",[],,t1_fq0pda7,False,0,[],False,"<div class=""md""><p>I‚Äôm so very sorry that you‚Äôre here with us. This is the most difficult ‚Äúdecision‚Äù a parent ever has to make. Please try to be kind to yourself during this time and know that you are taking away all of your son‚Äôs pain and holding it in your heart for him. You are exactly the mother he needs you to be. ‚ù§Ô∏è</p>

<p>I also have an induced L&amp;D birth story at 22+3, and I was going to refer you to my posts, but my birth story was posted in my bumper group. (Sorry that it‚Äôs so long, I wrote it just after we said goodbye to our daughter).</p>

<p>We went into the hospital at 6:30AM on Feb 18, 2020 to become induced. I had to take mifepristone 24 hours prior in order to begin blocking pregnancy hormones and preparing my cervix. This was so incredibly emotionally difficult, as I felt I was the one who had to begin the process. It was a lot to mentally deal with that day, as we continued to live our life in limbo, trying to cherish our time with our girl, yet trying to prepare ourselves for what was to come. The day before inducing was hands down the worst day of my life. </p>

<p>Around 7:20AM on the 18th is when I began to receive misoprostol tablets that were inserted into my cervix manually every 4 hours. Honestly - EFF OUCH!! Within 40 minutes, I began to cramp, which I was told was a good sign, but caused an immense amount of constant pain. I finally asked for pain meds around 10, and received a very small dose of a fentanyl drip that I could self-administer every 5 minutes. This genuinely helped keep the constant cramping ‚Äúat bay‚Äù for 1-2 hours, before the next dosage began to kick in. It was like terribly painful period cramps all day long. My amazing nurse upped the dosages as the day went along and the pain increased.</p>

<p>The exhaustion, hunger, fentanyl, and pain, caused me to be incredibly nauseous numerous times, despite a few different medicinal nausea reliefs (no idea what they were, as I was so out of it). My pain continued on, never ‚Äúwaxing‚Äù or ‚Äúwaning‚Äù as in typical labour contractions, and I was continuously told this was good it was happening so quickly. Things were progressing better than they hoped. Around 4:00 is when things began to really ramp up for me and the contractions started coming. My water broke at 5:00 and that‚Äôs when I finally felt relief for the first time all day. I was scared because I didn‚Äôt know when it would happen and what it would feel like. This was my first pregnancy and first delivery, so I absolutely no clue what to do. I hadn‚Äôt prepared for birth because I wasn‚Äôt prepared mentally to give birth after 5 months. Even in this induced situation, my body knew it was just about time when I randomly snapped at my mother to leave the room because it was time. I had a handful of major ‚Äútypical‚Äù contractions that came and went. After two pushes, our daughter arrived sleeping just after 5:30. We don‚Äôt think she took a breath earth-side, but we did see some reflex movements.</p>

<p>We had some time together to hold her and take photos before we became concerned that my placenta wasn‚Äôt going to come naturally. My husband cried when he held her, and I was in the largest state of shock. In the 6 days from the more complete diagnosis until her birth, I was an emotional, weeping, shell of myself. But with the rush of hormones, pain, exhaustion, joy of meeting my daughter, hunger, pain meds, and maternal instinct to carry forward and nurture above it all, I was just in complete shock. Almost numb to all of it and didn‚Äôt cry once that day. Which is the furthest from how I ever am. I am happy, though, that I was able to stay calm and completely enjoy our time together. </p>

<p>My doctor tried to remove my placenta manually (oh my god... so painful), and he was able to get half of it. He left us for a bit in the hopes the rest would come. </p>

<p>Our nurse was absolutely phenomenal the entire day - from my care, our daughter‚Äôs delivery, and her care afterwards. I‚Äôm so grateful for her during this impossible time. She took photos of us, weighed, and measured our little girl. She broke 1lb! 1lb 1oz. She was so tiny, but so big in our eyes. We got a cute little knit hat for her and some keepsake items (matching hearts, memory box, and she helped do the footprints and handprints). We got to spend a few hours with our little girl just cuddling and admiring her. Gushing over how perfect she is to us.</p>

<p>Our doctor returned and he decided he wanted to move me to another room with more instruments to remove the rest of the placenta. He basically performed a D&amp;C ‚Äúwithout performing one‚Äù to get the rest of it, discovered a tear in my cervix, and repaired it all right there. My body had experienced so much pain already and I just felt like it would never end. </p>

<p>I got to come back to our little girl and spend a little bit more time with her before my doctor came back and told me he was concerned about the tear and wanted to make sure he got all the placenta. He wanted to perform a full D&amp;C to be safe. This meant I only had 45 minutes left with our little girl. We were only allowed 4 hours with her, as they said it would be an infection issue after that point and they could need to place her somewhere cool for any additional time. I wish we had the cuddlecots I know they have in the UK.</p>

<p>I said my goodbye to my sweet girl, kissed her one last time, and left her with her piece of the heart and the matching momma bunny stuffy I had been cuddling for the last several days and with her. We took the matching baby bunny stuffy home and I cuddle it all the time. The D&amp;C happened so quickly for me as I was sedated and woke up in what seemed like seconds later. Everything seemed to go well, I slowly came out of that anesthesia, and my husband and went back to our empty room. I actually ended up having 2 cervical tears instead of 1, so I‚Äôm glad my doctor pushed for a full D&amp;C to discover and repair it, too.</p>

<p>My husband and I slept as it was 11:30PM by that point and we had been awake since 5:00AM. We slept for about an hour before my final check and clearance to go home. It was all over. Leaving the hospital without our little girl was devastating. How our lives changed so drastically in 14 day‚Äôs time...</p>

<p>I‚Äôm now 11.5 weeks out from saying hello and goodbye to our daughter. I occasionally get thrown back to the earlier, dark days, but generally the intensity of it all has lessened. I think of our daughter all the time and it still hurts. But I‚Äôm also able to smile and be so incredibly happy for the time that we did have with her. I don‚Äôt regret a single second of our time with her, although I will always wish it was more. I have things I ‚Äúwished‚Äù I would‚Äôve done in hindsight, but honestly I just did what felt right in the moment. It would never have been ‚Äúenough,‚Äù because we lost a lifetime with her. </p>

She was perfect and the doctors don't know why I spontaneously went into labor. My placenta report said there was an infection (acute chorioamnionitis and a couple of other things), but I don't know if the infection caused my cervix to painlessly soften & dilate, or if my cervix weakened and allowed the bacteria to travel up and into my uterus, where it caused an infection. I'm commenting to share my L&D experience since I delivered around where you are now. I hope that's okay. 

My labor, or at least the painful part, was extremely fast. I arrived at the hospital at around 5 am and by 7, my daughter was born. When I arrived at L&D triage, my membranes were already bulging through my cervix. My water hadn't broken. I asked for pain medicine when I was in triage, but it took them a while to actually get it from the pharmacy, so I felt most of my contractions. I didn't get medication (I think some kind of opioid plus Benadryl) until it was almost time to push. I didn't want an epidural because I was scared and in shock, and anyway there wasn't time to give me one.

Actually delivering her was not that difficult. The doctor broke my water when I was in the delivery room. My daughter was breech and when the doctor in triage told me that, I was scared they would make me have surgery, but they didn't (probably because she wasn't considered viable and so if she died in labor it would make no difference... that sounds cold when I write that out, because it sure as hell mattered to me, but they were not going to provide medical intervention to save her if born alive, which she was). So, my daughter was born feet first, alive and breathing. The most painful part was pushing out her head. I didn't have to push that long because the contractions were so strong and forceful, and my baby was so small, that it was all over very quickly. I didn't tear. I know I was pretty lucky. I felt the pain even though they'd given me drugs, although the drugs took the edge off.

My experience was traumatic because it was so unexpected. My body was in shock and my mind was numb. I started shaking violently and uncontrollably before it came time to push. I thought I was going to die, and at that point I wasn't even scared because the whole thing was so horrible and I just wanted it to be over.

The knowing and waiting is a horrible, scary time and I hate that anyone has to go through that. I can share my story, it was much less terrifying than I thought it was going to be. I was 24 weeks but my son was measuring about 2 weeks behind at this point. 

I was given miso the evening before. Through the night I kept waking up with tight stomach muscles - I thought I was just anxious but they were contractions starting. I noticed I had bled a little before I got to the hospital in the morning but there was no pain. I was given an epidural (or spinal? I‚Äôm unsure of the difference, I live in a country where they don‚Äôt speak my first language so some of the terms got lost on me). I was also given a catheter and then the injection to stop the heartbeat. 

I was then taken to a separate delivery room and given more miso and had the pill inserted that softens the cervix. I could feel it was uncomfortable but there was no pain. I had been told that because it was not a live birth they would give me as much pain medication as needed to make sure I couldn‚Äôt feel anything. I was shaking uncontrollably, which my midwife later told me was because of the medication. My midwife came to check how everything was starting etc and said my contractions were already strong (I couldn‚Äôt tell). I was given a button to push for more pain medication whenever I felt ‚Äòsomething‚Äô.  Every 3 hours I was given more miso. When I was more dilated I was given something (I can‚Äôt remember what, I‚Äôm sorry) that made me throw up the whole bunch of nothing because you can‚Äôt eat. This all took about 11 hours and then I felt the urge to push which I was terrified about because I had no idea what to expect and that part was quick. He was so small it took less than 10 minutes. It was hard to really push because I had never done it and couldn‚Äôt feel anything but it didn‚Äôt matter.  

My placenta got a bit stuck and they called a doctor to come and manually remove it. They gave me antibiotics before this and more pain medication. I felt no pain but again it wasn‚Äôt very comfortable. 

They brought the baby out to us, we had been unsure about seeing the baby - we had known for months there was something very wrong and we were scared it would be even more painful to see him and to be honest I was just scared of what he would look like. All my son‚Äôs defects were internal so he looked perfect, though incredibly small. Seeing him I felt a burst of happiness/amazement but it was also devastating. My midwife gently convinced us to see him, she said that it helps with grieving. I made sure we took our own photos and I treasure them now. 

My husband was allowed to stay with me in the hospital. We were there 2 nights. The first night I asked for a pill to stop my milk coming in, I asked about this in my pre-meeting with the doctors, it wasn‚Äôt them who brought it up so if you want this ask for it (I don‚Äôt know if they just don‚Äôt think about it or what). It took a long time for the bruise from the epidural to go away and I had retained a small piece of placenta but it was ok. I was mostly in shock I think, I got anxious and sometimes would get panic attacks or shaking when people would touch my back or come too close to me. I couldn‚Äôt touch my own stomach for a few weeks without feeling sick and weird but I think that was the emotional side of things. 

This is getting long so I‚Äôll just say that it is all very controlled, they made sure I felt nothing before starting everything properly. The focus is on your comfort.

First of all I am so very sorry for your loss. It is the worst. 
Second of all, in spite of everything I am going to say, I completely understand feeling like you are never going to have a baby because I feel like that all the time.
However, some things to hopefully reassure you a bit and I hope none of this comes off as patronizing or platitudes because your feelings are totally valid.
1) It is a good sign that you have gotten pregnant before
2) You are still on the younger side so although it sucks so much to not be pregnant/have a baby yet, the odds are in your favor to have a healthy pregnancy and baby
3) Five months is still very much within a normal range for trying to get pregnant
4) It is AWESOME if your doctor is willing to start some testing because a lot of people will not until it has been a year if you are under 30.
5) A lot of issues with conceiving and having a healthy pregnancy can be easily fixed. So even if there is something going on, it might be something there is a simple solution to. 
I hope none of that came off as trying to push off your concerns because I totally get it and I also get how unfair it feels that it isn‚Äôt happening easily for you. Just wanted to give you some hope. I wish you the very best of luck!",[],,t1_fpwgcxs,False,0,[],False,"<div class=""md""><p>Hi!

I‚Äôve had several ultrasounds and she has confirmed I am making eggs, that the uterus has a good shape and thickness, etc. I personally am always up on yearly standard bloodwork - so I have a history of knowing that I‚Äôm not hypothyroid, various other things. I have regular cycles. I‚Äôm not overweight. I don‚Äôt know what tests/bloodwork the nurse was referring to - but checking to rule out things is a GOOD thing, not bad. Try not to be scared of bloodwork. If they made you panic with their tone, know that other doctors might have a different manner and if you can find a doctor you feel good with, then find him/her. I have also been trying for about as long as you, after my MMC in September. It‚Äôs frustrating. But don‚Äôt lose hope just yet!

It was the ""easy"" way out.  But mentally it was the best choice for my husband and I.  These were our first and third pregnancies.  We'd tried for a year the first time, and months the next time.  I had depression that was worsened by triggers of babies and other pregnancies.

<p>It‚Äôs possible. And I wish surrogacy wasn‚Äôt a small fortune because I would choose it in a heartbeat. My body betrayed me. Every pregnancy from now on will be high risk and I can‚Äôt go into labor because I had a classical c section...it could be very dangerous for me and baby. </p>

<p>With all that said, it has always been my dream to have children and my dreams outweigh anything else. You‚Äôll know when you‚Äôre ready. I was ready about 3 months after my daughter died. It‚Äôs appropriate when you decide it is. It‚Äôs appropriate when your doctor says it is. You would just be giving you son a baby brother or sister....just like you probably would have if he didn‚Äôt die...the timeline is just a bit different. </p>

<p>Sending you all the love in the world.</p>

I had a MMC at 11 weeks (measured 8 weeks. I found out on April fool's day). I, too, had very negative feelings surrounding my body after the miscarriage. I felt fat (because of my pregnancy eating habits) and resented that I had a ""belly"" but no pregnancy.

The two main symptoms I had at the time I learned of the miscarriage were breast tenderness and urinary frequency. I'd say those were gone less than a week after the d&c.

I agree that it's hard to comprehend the magnitude of the experience of a miscarriage until you've had one yourself. It's more devastating than I could've imagined.

It feels like something extra is wrong when our bodies can‚Äôt realize and continue to trick us...for me it made the news even worse. It‚Äôs so tough and I‚Äôm so unbelievably sorry you‚Äôre going through this as well. If you want to talk I‚Äôm here.</p>

<p>In terms of procedures: I tried to get a D&amp;C and personally had a very poor experience (due to dr treatment leaving me terrified, alone, and without the finished procedure) and I also took the medication. I know others have had decent D&amp;C experiences so I‚Äôm sure yours will be fine. It‚Äôs definitely quicker than the meds and honestly the medication hurts though I know for me personally, I still want to try the meds first because they won‚Äôt give me a D&amp;C without putting me under first after my last experience and I don‚Äôt want to do that without my husband being nearby. </p>

<p>Good luck and again so sorry ‚ù§Ô∏è</p>

Still spotting after two weeks seems to be normal, and your uterus will still be contracting back down to a smaller size. I didn‚Äôt have the d&e though so maybe someone else will have a better answer for you. 

There are mixed responses about waiting until after your first period but the general consensus is that it‚Äôs not necessary. It seems like you are waiting for the genetic results though? We did the same and it took 2 months, which is when my first period came back anyway (I had additional complications). It was really, really hard to wait to try again when it was the only thing we wanted to do and it was also terrifying It knowing what the results would tell us. My only advice would be to concentrate on things you want to do, make looking after yourself your top priority. It‚Äôs still going to be tough but it is still like working towards the ‚Äògoal‚Äô of having a baby because you‚Äôre helping yourself be ready again - if this makes sense? This idea helped me and my husband a lot at the time. Also if you‚Äôre doing something and feel sad/suddenly not into it anymore stop. Our grief counselor gave us this advice and we had times when we when out to shop for something and got out of the car, felt not okay, so went back home. It‚Äôs nice to have someone give you ‚Äòpermission‚Äô to put your wants first. 

We found out at our 12 week scan that there was a weird shadow in the stomach. My original obgyn said it was probably a fault with the machine so we didn‚Äôt think much of it. At 15 weeks we found out it was a congenital diaphragmatic hernia which has a very low survival rate because the lungs don‚Äôt grow and that it was even more rare to find it so early on. I had an amnio and nothing abnormal was found. At 21 weeks we found additional problems with the brain which led to an incompatible with life prognosis and I was induced at 24 weeks. I had bleeding the entire first trimester and was very anxious about the pregnancy, I even had a dream before my positive test that I gave birth to a tiny baby boy and was irrationally scared that if the baby was a boy the dream would come true (which it did in a way, we had a boy). Looking back it‚Äôs hard to say if it was a feeling I had or I was just anxious anyway. We had genetic testing, they ask a lot about your family history for the first meeting. We had no history of problems so we‚Äôre told it was unlikely to be a genetic issue, which ended up to be true.

Happy to share my anecdotes re. ERPC (surgical management/D&E) if it would be of any help.  This was in response to a MMC that was (luckily) found very quickly around 9-10w mark (foetal growth was equivalent so HB only stopped a few days after a positive scan).

I am 22 days post-op today and found I had most of my bleeding in the days immediately after the op, with it mainly being spotting from around the 12-14 day mark that tailed off also.  There is nothing there when I wipe/go to the toilet, and at night I don't need to wear anything, but if I exert myself (exercise) then I still have a small bit of pink/brown discharge which I need a pantyliner for.

What you describe is also a normal healing pattern IMHO - the main thing is that the bleeding is decreasing overall over time.  At the two week mark I was also still sometimes getting a random bright red spot/tiny clot so I know that frustration.  If you are feeling well in yourself and not in pain, just keep monitoring yourself and I'm sure the bleeding will stop properly soon.

Concerning the uterine tightness, I also felt that my uterus was very sensitive - I started to do some exercise around the two-week mark and it was very tender afterwards.  Again, I think this is usual as everything is contracting back down, and also remember that you've undergone a surgical procedure so everything internally is also recovering from that too.

About when you can start TTC again, I am not a medical professional, but from my own research, provided your doctor didn't tell you **explicitly** for medical reasons that you should wait (molar pregnancy etc), then there's no harm in starting as soon as you feel physically and emotionally recovered from the op.  You should wait until bleeding from your surgery has resolved though, and obviously the first cycle can be a bit wonky in terms of ovulation etc.

The possible wonkiness is behind the traditional line a lot of medical professionals give of waiting until you get your period, i.e. purely for dating purposes, not for health reasons. [Recent studies](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=1&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=2ahUKEwiKgeSVx53pAhVVtXEKHTTZDNAQFjAAegQIARAB&url=https%3A%2F%2Fbloomlife.com%2Fpreg-u%2Fhow-soon-after-miscarriage-can-i-get-pregnant%2F&usg=AOvVaw3eLKvomoYkJjsx_m_G-wed) also suggest there is benefit in TTC again sooner rather than later from a MC, but the bottom line is, it's a personal decision.  If you do want to start sooner, I'd advise you do your own research and go back to actively check with your doctor as to what they've told you.

<p>Doctor said if I had no signs of infection (fever, smell, pain, or heavy bleeding) I could wait it out and see if my body finished the process. I tracked an ovulation this past week just days after passing the tissue, so think I‚Äôm finally done.</p>

<p>We aren‚Äôt everyday people lol. Hell on honey moon for the 10 days we did it 5 times. One of those was the lucky one. I was super regular before the loss but we also were abstaining for the year before the wedding(we were just trying to prevent me from getting pregnant during wedding). Our first time doing it again was honeymoon so I keep going back to those must of been super sperm how can I get them back!!!</p>

My story is identical to yours apart from we started trying in December.  I similarly was a huge planner and prepper - started taking prenatals three months before we were even going to start TTC, all that shabang.

I'm afraid I don't have anything particularly to add re. excitement, but all I can say is that I've tried to come to peace with what has happened and just take things as they come - I similarly am not sure 100% sure what's happening with my cycle, but either way, all I can do is try to get sperm and egg together, and in a few weeks' time I'll either be pregnant again or my period will show up.  If it's the latter, then we'll just re-set and start again.

It sucks, but my takeaway from this experience is that I can't control everything.  It hit hard because one of the few things I always felt I had a great degree of control over was my body, but pregnancy taught me that was sooo wrong.  Although I will start using OPKs and tracking a bit harder if this cycle doesn't work, I will also try and be a bit more relaxed about things.  The worst thing has already happened to me, so the only way to go is up.

Although I was very frustrated and angry with my body, I've realised not to be so hard on it.  I've tried to trust that it knew what it was doing, that the pregnancy was most likely not viable (most likely for an undetectable chromosomal/genetic issue) and what's happened has saved me further heartache or upset in the longer term.

In terms of hope inspo, it helps me to remember that I was able to get pregnant once, so hopefully that bodes well for a better result in the future.  I also read up on a lot of articles about how common miscarriage is, and that most people will carry to term afterwards.  I like to think that I was just on the wrong side of the stats this time.  It's more likely than not that I will have a successful pregnancy sooner rather than later.

I personally also like to read the stories of women who've experienced MC and had a successful pregnancy shortly after.  I know everything is anecdotal, but it makes me feel more positive about where I am.

I lurk on this subreddit because I had so many questions with TTC after my miscarriage at 6 weeks before getting pregnant again. I can't speak to your specific situation or state, but I can share my experience so far.  

I had in person appointments at 7 weeks (confirmation), 9 weeks (dating ultrasound), and 13 weeks (NIPT and other bloodwork) before all this started. Then my anatomy scan was at 18 weeks in mid-March. I was very fortunate to be able to have my husband attend and that was such a special moment. We weren't able to get good views of his heart so I had a follow-up anatomy scan at 22 weeks. My OBGYN office called to say my location had been closed so I was going to have to reschedule for the main location and I was no longer allowed to have visitors. So I went to that location, which is in the main hospital, by myself. 

My next appointment was going to be telehealth at 26 weeks, but I got a call that they are reopening my usual location and they asked if I would prefer in person. So I rescheduled to that location and in person, but I am still not able to have my husband come with me. After this appointment, they will do the glucose test and a third trimester ultrasound, so I think at least 2 more appointments have to be in person. I'm hoping all appointments will be in person from here on out and that they will lift the visitor restrictions.

Not having my husband at my last appointment and at future appointments has been hard. I have a lot of anxiety around my appointments and am always preparing myself to hear the worst. I really don't understand how having him with me causes any additional risks since we are exposed to each other at home and it doesn't seem worth me getting so worked up not having him there.

I hope that helps. Let me know if I can help with any other questions. I'm so sorry for your loss and I wish you the best!",[],,t1_fp65uz1,False,0,[],False,"<div class=""md""><p>TW: current pregnancy</p>

<p>I‚Äôm working hard to try to hold it together but I don‚Äôt know if I can cope with the future looking so sad and so bleak. I never in my life had nothing positive to look forward to. </p>

<p>As a couple we‚Äôve had other challenges. One summer my husband had to get a bowel resection and that was tough, last May on his birthday he threw a pulmonary embolus, and he‚Äôs on blood thinner, we got through that. We never had grief before but still. To just look at the future and see all the sadness is killing me. I don‚Äôt really know how I am going to survive this all. Will it always be so grim?</p>

I didn‚Äôt enjoy the first 8 weeks of pregnancy. I was riddled with anxiety. But, when I got my first dating scan and I saw that little tiny heartbeat, my mind let go a little bit....enough for me to be happy! 

When I was between 9 and 10 weeks, I started bleeding (not just spotting, like bright red blood) and immediately thought, ‚ÄúMy happiness wasn‚Äôt meant to be. We lost it.‚Äù I cried myself to sleep that night and slept maybe an hour. I called the doctor‚Äôs office as soon as they opened and made an appointment. She did an ultrasound and saw my little jelly bean swimming around without a care in the world. My doctor has been super understanding (same doctor that was with me through my ectopic) and she saw me every two weeks after that to reassure me (usual schedule is every 4 during first trimester).

My advice to any mom who is trying to conceive after a loss is this. Your body went through a trauma. Give it time to heal and forgive it if it isn‚Äôt ready at the same time your mind is. When you do get that positive, just marvel in your body‚Äôs ability to do what it does. Enjoy every second of it. Don‚Äôt let the past mess up what is happening to you right now. Because on that day, in that moment, you will be pregnant! And that‚Äôs as far as we can see into the future! We can‚Äôt control what happens once that process starts. And there is nothing...NOTHING that we can do to cause an ectopic or cause a miscarriage to happen. If we could, crack babies wouldn‚Äôt exist. Just believe in your body‚Äôs abilities and know that your odds of that happening again are super low. 

And lastly, write to the baby; in a journal or in the notes app on your phone. I can‚Äôt tell you how therapeutic it is to just sit and write once a week or so to say hi and tell them how I‚Äôm feeling or what they‚Äôve been doing to mom this week. It‚Äôs nice to keep record and to look back at once in a while to reassure me that even though I‚Äôm anxious now, we‚Äôve come so so far from when this started.

When you do get that positive, just marvel in your body‚Äôs ability to do what it does. Enjoy every second of it. Don‚Äôt let the past mess up what is happening to you right now. Because on that day, in that moment, you will be pregnant! And that‚Äôs as far as we can see into the future! We can‚Äôt control what happens once that process starts. And there is nothing...NOTHING that we can do to cause an ectopic or cause a miscarriage to happen. If we could, crack babies wouldn‚Äôt exist. Just believe in your body‚Äôs abilities and know that your odds of that happening again are super low. </p>

<p>And lastly, write to the baby; in a journal or in the notes app on your phone. I can‚Äôt tell you how therapeutic it is to just sit and write once a week or so to say hi and tell them how I‚Äôm feeling or what they‚Äôve been doing to mom this week. It‚Äôs nice to keep record and to look back at once in a while to reassure me that even though I‚Äôm anxious now, we‚Äôve come so so far from when this started. And someday, she will know our journey too. If you need anything, feel free to reach out in a DM. I will be your cheering section or whatever you need.</p>

The grief changed.

I'd definitely say that the longer we TTC before we got pregnant with the one that stuck, the worse my experience was. 

Then we had a baby (after a long anxiety filled pregnancy). The other due dates still stung. Seeing my friend's kids have birthdays and play dates and thinking I was so happy to have this baby but sad I couldn't have had the life I envisioned with the other babies. 

Then our baby turned 1 and we planned our embryo transfer for baby 2. We also moved halfway across the country. I was so focused on that that I wasn't bothered by the loss dates that passed.

Before I got pregnant after my loss, I felt strongly the only thing that would help me move on was being pregnant. Surprisingly my wonderful therapist agreed with me that it probably was, which made me feel less like a crazy desperate person, and more like someone just trying to get by. 

Then when I first got pregnant again, I was disappointed that I felt I‚Äôd never have that same euphoria I had with my first pregnancy.

I got to be a pro at it, icing my belly before I started and injecting the medicine really, really slowly. It never burned or bruised (I was on 400iu Gonal F and 150iu menopur). The retrieval was nothing - it's done under twilight and I had had that for my earlier D&C and hysteroscopies. I was uncomfortably bloated for the second half of stims and had mild OHSS that cleared up a couple of days after my retrieval.

It's super rare so she was working with researchers at a university who studied the disease in the hopes they could identify the gene before she tried for kids.

Of those, some had her genetic condition, some had chromosomal abnormalities, some had both, and there were 3 or 4  clear on both fronts. They had success with their first transfer. 

All in all, the IVF wasn't the worst thing. If our transfer hadn't worked out we were going to do another round using a different protocol.

I am a carrier of an X-linked disorder, so my odds are the same as yours: 1 in 4 pregnancies will be affected.

If you haven't been referred yet to a genetic counselor, you should be; they can walk you through next steps. Here's what they told me (the disease I am a carrier for is one of the more common ones, so I think my experience is probably pretty typical):

* Single-disorder testing usually requires the genetic testing company to develop a custom test just for you. This process takes 3ish months.
* My clinic (and some others) will not start an IVF cycle until the test development is complete. This is because, sometimes (very rarely), the genetic testing company will fail to develop a test. They don't want to have you do IVF if it turns out they can't test the embryos anyways.

So for me, this building-the-test part was the rate-limiting step (at least until COVID shut everything down). However long my OB would have wanted me to wait to TTC, the procedural part of contacting the genetic testing company + waiting for them to finish making the test + getting started on the IVF cycle was already going to take longer than that waiting period.

We have been trying for sox months and still we have no announcements for any of those people. I feel deeply embarrassed. But like you, I shouldn‚Äôt. TTC is stressful enough as it is. Take time to go through your emotions and when you are ready, you can have a chat with everyone who spilled the beans.</p>

Essentially the reason you were told all those things, is that they're true. Early pregnancy is a terribly vague time as far as predicting outcomes go. In some people everything is exactly like clockwork, and in others everything is abnormal, and the rest are somewhere in between. And it had a very poor correlation with how your pregnancy turns out. 

Bleeding in early pregnancy IS extremely common and in about 90% of cases is nothing. Some people only ever get a light line of the HPT. Some people with normal pregnancies have slowly rising HCGs. It is possible to be off on your dates even if you're tracking. Some people have no symptoms. It's so, so difficult to make any predictions about early pregnancy, and it so often turns out ok that we tend to err on the side of 'just wait and see' until there's some concrete evidence it's not. 

It's not any easier when you are a doctor. My first miscarriage I went to my 7 week USS and there was no heartbeat. So they said it was probably a bit earlier than I thought, so they'd repeat in 2 weeks. That 2 weeks is BRUTAL. I was worried so I did 2x HCGs, and it decreased between the two levels. I went on my medical mums group, and asked for advice. Basically said I knew I needed to wait for a second scan, but this is a failed pregnancy, right? I got about 30 replies, a good handful of which were people with the same history, and who ended up with normal pregnancies, and a lot of OBs saying early pregnancy is so unpredictable you can't really say, and to wait. 

It's a very imprecise science. We really don't know. Ive occasionally been SURE a pt was having a bad outcome and it turned out fine. And it's a worrying enough time. So really all you can do is wait for a definite ok or not, and we try not to unnecessarily worry people in the meantime.

I need to remind myself that although things feel slow and frustrating atm, it's more important to be fully better so as not to jeopardise my future chances.  I'm lucky in that my bleeding seems to have resolved quickly and I already feel a lot better.

I TFMR due to spina bifida (myelomeningocele with chiari 2 malformation (banana sign, lemon sign), severely enlarged ventricals, club foot, abnormal lower articulation etc etc)...

I was taking more than the recommended dose of folic acid for 1 year prior to conceiving. But I was also nursing a 3 year old. 

Prior to that I've had a miscarriage in first trimester. Then my TFMR. 

Honestly, it's a folic acid linked deficiency. MFM didn't want to test me for the MTHFR gene mutation, because the treatment going forward would be the same. 5mg Folate. 

I just suffered another chemical pregnancy last cycle and I am very upset that I allowed myself to STOP the Folate prior. Your body needs it for rapid cell division. 

I have no evidence the CP was due to Folate linked deficiency but common sense tells me I should have not stopped taking it. 

If I have a true mthfr mutation then my body needs FOLATE, not folic acid. Folate is a bioavailable form of the b vitamin, one that our bodies can naturally absorb and utilize. Folic acid is synthetic and can take up the receptors in our bodies, therefore inhibiting absorption of the bioavailable Folate. If that makes sense. 

I am not a doctor and this is not medical advice!! This is just what I was told by MFM and what I understand. 

My concern was taking such high doses long term with no monitoring. I wasn't comfortable with that. I was told to start it 3 months prior to conceiving to build up my stores. 

Well it took 6 months to conceive. I've heard high doses MAY contribute to birth defects but I cannot quote any peer reviewed medical literature on that one so do your own research. 

This is just my understanding and experience. I've started it back up but I'm taking 2-3mg and will resume 5mg for 12 weeks should we conceive again.

Are you temping at all? I ask because OPKs show a spike in LH, which is usually right before you ovulate, but some people don't ovulate even after that spike. Temping could possibly help verify that you are actually ovulating.

Did you come off birth control when you started TTCing, right before conceiving? There are some studies that show some people are more likely to conceive directly after stopping, especially depending on the TYPE of birth control. 

I hope you can get some testing done - I know COVID is messing up tons of things. :( If you are able to get testing, please don't let them forget about the sperm!! Test your husband!! Many doctors will test the woman, over and over, and not even do a simple sperm analysis. Its easy and simple and can give you good info.

I always suggest, at a minimum:  


* CD3 testing followed up with surge testing to compare the results (and this should be LH, Estradiol, and FSH)
* General thyroid testing - and this should be **T3, T4, TSH, and T3RU** (all of these aren't usually done)
* **Thyroid peroxidase antibody (TPO)** test. Many doctors won't do this if the others come back normal, but TPO can still be elevated and cause issues.¬†
* Prolactin¬†
* Factor V Leiden Mutation - for clotting (2nd most common inherited thrombophilia in the US)
* Progesterone testing (cycle day 21 blood test) on multiple cycles. This test is done at 7 Days Post Ovulation (CD21 for the average cycle) to see if you ovulated. You want a level of 10 on an unmedicated cycle. If its lower than that, its harder for implantation to succeed.

<p>And I&#39;m just ignoring the predictions on the chart this cycle.</p>

You are allowed to be sad. You are allowed to have ugly cries and to not have it together. That's part of the process so you can come out a (different) whole person for your daughter and any future babies. Grief is an ugly monster that you learn to live with. It never goes away and likes to pounce when you're at your weakest. BUT, you will get stronger. You will keep living. Each day is an opportunity to make your baby proud of you, even if that means little things like taking a shower or brushing your teeth.

<p>I had a manual vacuum aspiration after two bouts of misoprostol and retained products, which is apparently super low risk in terms of scarring and I bled so heavily immediately afterwards, I was convinced something had gone wrong. It&#39;s a relatively rare procedure so there&#39;s very little information available online about personal experiences. My only symptom so to speak was one slightly light period after two normal ones. </p>

Just from my experience it seems HCG has to fall below a certain threshold before your cycle carries on. I drank a crazy amount of water in hopes it would help my system move things along. No idea if it helped but it didn't hurt.

The first time I found out I was pregnant it was such a shock. I‚Äôd just had surgery to diagnose/remove endometriosis and it was Mother‚Äôs Day (uk). I was so overwhelmed and happy, all I could picture was having a baby - miscarriage didn‚Äôt cross my mind because why would it happen to me? 
The second pregnancy I knew from the get go something wasn‚Äôt right, i could just feel it, I was waiting for it to happen. 
And the third time, I was scared but I thought this is the one! Third time lucky. I remember telling my FH that he could be excited because this baby was going to make it. I felt like I‚Äôd lied to myself let myself build my hopes up. 
I spent my first due date miscarrying my third pregnancy. My second due date is coming up the day after my birthday next month AND to top it off I‚Äôm due on. My third due date will be a week after FH birthday, I think back to when I first worked the due date out I thought imagine baby being born on FH birthday what a present.
