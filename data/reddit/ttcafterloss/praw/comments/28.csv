Back hurts, in the tub. Having a cry about the first baby. A little guilt. Both for ""forgetting"" about baby 1 while pregnant with baby boy, and for dwelling on baby 1 instead of rejoicing over baby boy. 

How can it be both? I don't know. 

Things are a bit rough. I thought I'd be built for this but I was wrong. Nerve pain everywhere has me immobile (I mean by the time I do the dishes and wipe my counters I need to sit down it hurts so badly), so I just keep packing on pounds. But I'm hungry. I have no idea what to do. I'm not enjoying this (guilt), I just want him whole and here.

Oh and I want the first baby whole and here too, but we all know that's not happening.

Edit: of course hubby caught me crying so he explained life in wonderful terms and kissed me and cuddled me and put me to bed. :) I'm still kinda sad. But, I know the guilt is misplaced. ",[],,t1_d6ybkdi,False,0,[],False,"<div class=""md""><p>23w2d</p>

It's 4:30AM and my poor son has been vomiting since 11PM. 

Australia has a wonderful free service where you can call a nurse any time to get advice. They'll send you straight to the hospital if they consider the situation an emergency or will say visit a GP in x amount of time. Based on his symptoms (vomiting, fever, fast heartbeat, but otherwise ok) she recommended seeing a doctor in the next 2 hours. The only thing open now is the hospital which would likely have a long wait. So rather than waking him up to sit in the waiting room, we're going to let him sleep until the Dr's office opens at 8AM, provided he doesn't get any worse. He is sleeping soundly while I sit next to his bed, barf bowl at the ready.

Poor little guy. He fell asleep on the bus on the way home from the museum today which is unusual. He hasn't napped during the day since the beginning of this year, but I chalked it up to him waking up an hour early this morning because, as he said, ""I wanted to see you guys and I saw the sunrise."" He is such a kind little soul. 

We have been sharing food and a water bottle all day so I'm bracing myself for the inevitable vomit fest. 

I have been feeling really well lately and naively thought it could continue. Baby has moved from up and down to sideways which is surprisingly more comfortable. Pretty soon she'll be head down and playing soccer with my ribs so I'll enjoy this sideways position while it lasts. 

Edit: He woke up at 6:30 whining ""medicine."" We don't have any medicine so I gave him some water and put him back to bed. Then at 8:00 he waltzed into our room, exclaimed, ""it's a beautiful day!"" and is now narrating kid's shows to me on the sofa, happy as ever. He seems totally fine, just slightly warm. We'll take it easy today and give him bland foods and see how we go. I'm so glad he's feeling ok!

<p>We have been sharing food and a water bottle all day so I&#39;m bracing myself for the inevitable vomit fest. </p>

<p>I have been feeling really well lately and naively thought it could continue. Baby has moved from up and down to sideways which is surprisingly more comfortable. Pretty soon she&#39;ll be head down and playing soccer with my ribs so I&#39;ll enjoy this sideways position while it lasts. </p>

<p>Edit: He woke up at 6:30 whining &quot;medicine.&quot; We don&#39;t have any medicine so I gave him some water and put him back to bed. Then at 8:00 he waltzed into our room, exclaimed, &quot;it&#39;s a beautiful day!&quot; and is now narrating kid&#39;s shows to me on the sofa, happy as ever. He seems totally fine, just slightly warm. We&#39;ll take it easy today and give him bland foods and see how we go. I&#39;m so glad he&#39;s feeling ok! He&#39;s a happy little guy again!</p>

How many DPO are you? If it is still before your period is due then there's still a high chance of getting a false negative, even after getting a positive and using the same brand of test. However, there is also a high chance of having a CP this early. So unfortunately there's not much we can say for sure. If I were you I'd invest in some first response tests, if that's not what you've been using already, as they're more likely to give you an accurate result at the moment. 

If this is a CP or a false negative, then that is a really shitty thing for you to go through so soon in your TTCAL process, and I'm sorry. I know that for me, the TTC journey just kept getting harder and harder, because I felt as if I should be pregnant already, and going through that cycle of hope, anxiety, disappointment while still grieving is not an easy thing by anyone's standards. If you think you need time off to be more emotionally prepared then I can tell you, that time will not be wasted! Being ready emotionally is just as important as being ready physically, perhaps even more important. So don't give up on yourself just yet. 

Now, finally, I think I ought to mention that your post might be triggering to other users. You're not really supposed to post about positive pregnancy tests outside of the results and alumni threads.

I had to do the same last January, for our daughter Kate who had a chromosomal abnormality (trisomy 18, Edwards Syndrome. Horrible syndrome). If you want you can read our story here http://www.reddit.com/r/ttcafterloss/comments/42fwte/new_here_recently_lost_my_daughter_due_to_a_tfmr/

I also delivered our girl and although it was such a sad moment in my life, it also was the first time I experienced labour and gave birth, and it was very beautiful and special at the same time. 

I know this was the hardest decision you ever had to make. I say decision and not choice - it didn't really feel like a choice to me. Still you have to consciously decide and that is horrifying. 

I have felt quilt a lot of times. I have felt such a deep yearning for my child that I wished I did not make the decision at all so that I would have had longer with my child. I always knew though, in the deepest of my heart, that those feelings were because of what I lost, and not about what my child lost. I think I have made the most loving decision I could have made for my little Kate, who would have to go through so much suffering. We took on the pain of letting her go, so she would never feel any pain. I think that is what parents do for their children. 

So know that whatever people say to you, or how light heartedly they say they would ""never terminate"" - you are the parents of your sweet baby boy and you did what was best for him. You made a loving decision. 

Would you like sharing your sons name? I would love to hear it. There is also a remembrance wall (see the sidebar) where you can add him if you like.

About going forward. I stayed home for six weeks before returning to work. I couldn't cope with the outside world in the beginning and really had to be gentle to myself. Please give yourself the time you need. My first period showed up after 34 days and was brutal, physically and emotionally. It also felt strangely cathartic.

I didn't feel ready to try again until May, when the thought of being pregnant still scared me shitless but I also realised I would stay scared no matter how long I waited. So I decided to jump in and NTNP for a while. Doing that it sort of turned in to actively trying - no tracking or anything just having sex a lot between cd8 and cd20. 

TW: mention of current pregnancy 
I conceived in June after two cycles, but that ended up in a CP. I was disappointed but not as upset as I expected to be. The next cycle in July I conceived again. I'm now currently 8w5d and there is a heartbeat. I am still scared shitless and this is not easy, a whole new rollercoaster. But I know I will have to get through this scary part to have a baby. At the same time I am very happy I got here so fast and being pregnant has given me hope and some lightness in my step I lost after losing Kate. 

My advice to you is to be gentle and patient with yourself, allow yourself to grieve and let your feelings out. This sub is always here for you to listen. Know that when you feel your deepest pain and despair and the loss is so raw, that it is completely logical and ok to feel that, let it be, don't fight it. Just know that you will not feel like that forever. This text has helped me a lot: http://stillstandingmag.com/2016/01/dear-newly-bereaved-parent/

<p>I did develop some anxiety over using it and having my fears confirmed. Like when I was further along and knew I&#39;d be able to find the heartbeat if it was there, I started to get scared of being right so to speak.

You guys. Pillows. I finally slept and it took six pillows but I felt so much better. I was also absolutely exhausted. I think I slept 1.5 hours the night before. Couldn't nap after work.

Called the nurse and she said I could take Robitussin DM or Mucinex. I would have liked to avoid any medicine and toughed it out, but I was so desperate. I drank hot water with lemon juice and honey during the day, but it didn't do much. So I took the tussin. And my husband built a pillow pod around me and left me to sleep alone in the bed. And i slept!!!! Only woke up to pee a few times and reconstruct my pillows.

My throat still feels raw and gross and I would have liked to sleep more, but I gotta go to work, I don't have PTO to spare.

I'm a little worried about DH's job search. I know he knows he needs a job soon, and a good one. But I think he's still, three days, later overcome with sadness and grief at the loss of his job. And I think it's distracting him from doing what needs to be done. I don't want to tell him to not be sad and process his feelings, but I want to be like ok time to get over it, be an adult, shit happens, go make something better of it. So far all his leads are for small start ups and lower paying jobs. They're at least something, but please please please let him find something that will let me stay home with baby.",[],,t1_d6vx5dm,False,0,[],False,"<div class=""md""><p>24+2</p>

I have had a cold for 5 days, but decided I was OK enough to go back to work today. I was so congested and miserable all day. My doctor said I could use Afrin, and even though I read conflicting things online, I decided to do it. It helps a lot, but I feel insanely guilty for taking the risk. At the same time, my nausea has been majorly ramping up. Congestion and nausea are such a bad combination. At least I can't smell anything, so that's one less nausea trigger I have to worry about. I increased my Diclegis dose today, which helped the nausea, but left me a total zombie. I just took a week and half of vacation, then 2 sicks days, and then today I was present but barely functioning.

Finally at the end of the day I broke down and cried in the bathroom. It just isn't fair that I have to suffer through all this. I was sick through so much of my last pregnancy and I don't even have a baby to show for it - all of that 28 weeks was for nothing. It would be easier to get through if I knew for sure I was getting a baby out of this deal.

So when my husband came to pick me up I broke down again in the car and just told him all these things. I hadn't really thought it all out, as to what he might say in return, it just all spilled out. The main thing I kept saying is ""It's not my fault, I haven't done anything to deserve this."" I guess some part of me wanted him to affirm that it's not my fault. But instead he said, ""Why don't you go stay with parents for a week or 2, that would be easier on all of us."" I am trying really hard to evaluate this suggestion rationally, but I am pretty insulted that he wants to get rid of me. I know that he has been picking up a lot of house duties due to my sickness, and I think I was probably feeling like he is resenting me / blaming me for being sick / lazy - and it turns out that is exactly what he is feeling. He feels that I am such a drain on him that he would prefer that I just go away. So of course this made me cry more, which made my congestion worse. When I pressed him more he said he just doesn't have sympathy for sickness because he is never affected by colds. He mentioned how my mom exaggerates / acts pathetic, which might be true, but I don't think I do that. Well, I am pretty pathetic, but it is 100% authentic and not an act.

Both of us are really anxious about the first doctor's appointment in 2 days, so that's a background stressor as well. Oh, and my husband decided to host a dinner party tomorrow night. I am trying to figure out if there is any way I can run away or show up late to my own house. Husband's mom is cooking the dinner, so at least all I have to do is act pleasant to the guests, but in my current condition that is really hard. Tonight my head is pounding from sinus pressure and I think there is a chance this cold is turning into a sinus infection. Plus dinner is when I get the most nauseous, so it's going to be very unpleasant for me.

From what I have researched, MRI has the highest accuracy rate of a diagnostic tool for scar tissue (as compared to ultrasound). Hysteroscopy is invasive (though if you have it done awake with local anesthesia as I did, not too big of a deal) so it seems like most docs will do a screening test with MRI or ultrasound first before going forward with hysteroscopy. 

To answer your question though, I would think it is almost impossible to have scar tissue that does not show up in a hysteroscopy.

Since I was awake for my hysteroscopy, I got to see inside too, and it is a pretty clear picture.

I'm stretching my memory here, but I think some have discussed lining damage, which wouldn't show as bands of scar tissue. But again, if you have the hysteroscopy at the right time in your cycle, so that the surgeon can see a clear picture, they should be able to spot lining damage, as it will be visually obvious as different tissue from your endometrium.

I HIGHLY recommend reading all the info in these groups and being as well informed as possible before speaking with your doc.

<p>I have been kind of crampy throughout this pregnancy, which of course everyone says is totally normal, just your uterus expanding, whatever (and they&#39;re probably right), but it still gets me worried. However, about a week ago I saw a nice healthy baby on the ultrasound, and I&#39;m 10+5 now with no signs of anything being wrong. So what I&#39;m saying is, cramps are not always a bad sign!</p>

Also, it's my last day of work today. I'm pretty stoked. Working in social services is generally pretty thankless and burn-outy but it's all been a bit too much lately.

Since this pregnancy is being monitored so closely, I am privy to more information than when I was pregnant with my son. Two things that they have noticed in this pregnancy are low blood pressure and low iron levels. 

During the pregnancy with my son, I craved salty things at the start. Nothing was salty enough! My husband once got 6 different types of salt and vinegar chips to satisfy my cravings. So I think my body was telling me to eat more salt because my blood pressure was low. This pregnancy it has been at 90/50 most of the time but has risen slightly to 100/60 (still fairly low). 

Then towards the end of my pregnancy I craved hamburgers. I ate so many burgers I was worried my kid would be born in a bun! And in retrospect I think it was my body's way of getting more iron. For the past week or so I've been taking iron pills and I think it has really helped lessen my fatigue. 

Had an appointment with my midwife last week and she's pregnant! 17 weeks. I asked her if there is anything that has surprised her about pregnancy, since she's seen so much but is experiencing it firsthand now. She said she finally understands what pregnancy fatigue is like. Before she thought that the tiredness could be fixed with a nap or a bit of extra sleep, but she says after a full night's sleep she still wakes up exhausted. 

At the appointment baby was fairly active. She didn't punch the Doppler this time, but as soon as the Doppler touched my belly we could hear her heartbeat.

Some days I feel like I'm about to burst, but this week I'm feeling mostly OK. Friday was my husband's birthday so we both took the day off and went to the beach on what was a gloriously warm and sunny day. It is Winter down here but we enjoyed a fleeting hint of summer.

It's time for everyone's favorite: Posts From 3AM!!!! I'm your host, yesbabyplz, as usual. So let's get started!!

Why am I up at 3am this time? Well the other week I moved my desk from a nice pretty private area, to a pod cube with 5 other people. My new neighbor announced yesterday at our morning meeting to please bear with him as he had a bit of laryngitis. OK THEN.

So now I've got a phlegmy throat with that cough tickle. Coughing is dry, does not move the phlegm. Instead it sits there at the back of my throat irritating it and when I relax as I fall asleep my body panics that I am choking or suffocating or something. And awake I am. I am so propped up I am sitting. What else can I do?? Can I take ANYTHING? A cough drop? I've so far guzzled 40 oz of water and then got hungry and ate peanut butter crackers. The water actually helped a lot with my upper abdominal pressure that had been making it hard to breathe, but has done nothing for the throat.

Luckily, my husband doesn't seem bothered by my coughing, moaning, or sobbing and is sleeping soundly through it all. Good thing he doesn't have to get up early tomorrow. He does have an interview already in the afternoon at a company his friend works for but idk about it. For one, it's a start up. Has like a dozen employees and been around for two years. Not a solid company to work for to support your wife and child. But then where is?? The big established company he was working for laid him off! Also it's not the type of position he was looking for. 

That stupid guy won't even be there tomorrow for me to guilt trip. Apparently going to work sick is OK but you should stay home and use PTO to hunt baby snapping turtles????? I can't use PTO myself because I need to save it all for leave because a month ago they messed up reporting my hours so I thought I had been saving some when in fact I had negative hours.

I had my D&C on June 3rd and things have been weird since then. I thought I finally got my period 7 weeks later, but it was only basically 2 days of spotting. Then it stopped.

If it was the first, was the third my 2nd period? What was going on in the middle? Who the hell knows. I used OPKs for the entire duration between the first and third spotting without a clear line.

I had my D&amp;C on June 3rd and things have been weird since then. I thought I finally got my period 7 weeks later, but it was only basically 2 days of spotting. Then it stopped. Then a week later it started again and lasted for 10 days. Then 2 weeks after <em>that</em> it started again and lasted for 2 days. Was the first spotting my period or the second? If it was the first, was the third my 2nd period? What was going on in the middle? Who the hell knows. I used OPKs for the entire duration between the first and third spotting without a clear line.</p>

My husband is getting excited, too, I can feel it and see it. My energy levels have returned quite a bit and I don't feel like lying on the couch all day everyday anymore. Win! 

We saw the baby again yesterday and I wished the ultrasound could go on for much longer than it did. I just want to watch our little one kick and squirm in there. It's so stinkin cute. My doctor is seeing me every three weeks, since I am high risk this time around, and I am feeling very happy with this arrangement. Just about the time my anxiety gets out of control we have another appointment that calms it all down.

It&#39;s very exciting and every day feels like a new experience, since with my last pregnancy at this same point every day was stress and anxiety ultimately resulting in our loss. My husband is getting excited, too, I can feel it and see it. My energy levels have returned quite a bit and I don&#39;t feel like lying on the couch all day everyday anymore. Win! </p>

<p>We saw the baby again yesterday and I wished the ultrasound could go on for much longer than it did. I just want to watch our little one kick and squirm in there. It&#39;s so stinkin cute. My doctor is seeing me every three weeks, since I am high risk this time around, and I am feeling very happy with this arrangement. Just about the time my anxiety gets out of control we have another appointment that calms it all down. </p>

Over this past year we've been TTC, I have been tracking CM diligently. I have recorded EWCM in FF, I think, a total of *one* time, and that was even a stretch (haha, stretch). I have tried almost everything to remedy my lack of fertile CM including taking evening primrose oil, FertiliTea, FertileCM supplements, and preseed, and have documented my frustration in this sub many times. Nothing worked. I talked to my RE about this and he said sometimes CM chances after procedures like colposcopies and LEEPs, which I've had (although the i've found very little data to support this online). 

Well, I'm close to three weeks since spotting stopped and positive Wondfos stopped from the ectopic and lo and behold, a shit ton of EWCM has appeared. Like a TON. More than I have seen in years and years guys. Why and how did this happen?? I was like a kid in a candy store, stretching it with wide eyes. I texted my husband about it I was so excited. I've done nothing different to cause this, other than take my new supplements (high quality prenatals, fish oil, and maca) ONE time. I've heard maca can help with CM, but I highly doubt one damn dose would do anything. So I dunno what's happening but I'm happy that my system may have reset in more ways than one. 

This was followed by really horrible pressure and pain around my right hip. I have felt O pains before, they are slight. This kept me up and woke me up multiple times last night. I've read that a lot of women experience more severe/noticeable O pain after ectopics? But mine was so early. Also took an OPK this morning just to see and it was very close to positive. 

This is where I need support from you all - even though I am not ready to TTC and want to give my body more time, all of these signs have slapped me in the face. On one hand, I'm happy my body is going back to normal and then some! I have EWCM! But, I'm also not taking advantage of this beautiful alignment of my fertility signs. I had the urge to just have sex and throw caution to the wind yesterday. But then I was glad I didn't. But then the OPK this morning and I'm like...ugh...what a waste. But if I'm not ready, I'm not ready, right? I can't force TTC because of CM and pink lines telling me so. How should I interpret these conflicting feelings?

I talked to my RE about this and he said sometimes CM chances after procedures like colposcopies and LEEPs, which I&#39;ve had (although the i&#39;ve found very little data to support this online). </p>

<p>Well, I&#39;m close to three weeks since spotting stopped and positive Wondfos stopped from the ectopic and lo and behold, a shit ton of EWCM has appeared. Like a TON. More than I have seen in years and years guys. Why and how did this happen?? I was like a kid in a candy store, stretching it with wide eyes. I texted my husband about it I was so excited. I&#39;ve done nothing different to cause this, other than take my new supplements (high quality prenatals, fish oil, and maca) ONE time. I&#39;ve heard maca can help with CM, but I highly doubt one damn dose would do anything. So I dunno what&#39;s happening but I&#39;m happy that my system may have reset in more ways than one. </p>

<p>This was followed by really horrible pressure and pain around my right hip. I have felt O pains before, they are slight. This kept me up and woke me up multiple times last night. I&#39;ve read that a lot of women experience more severe/noticeable O pain after ectopics? But mine was so early. Also took an OPK this morning just to see and it was very close to positive. </p>

<p>This is where I need support from you all - even though I am not ready to TTC and want to give my body more time, all of these signs have slapped me in the face. On one hand, I&#39;m happy my body is going back to normal and then some! I have EWCM! But, I&#39;m also not taking advantage of this beautiful alignment of my fertility signs. I had the urge to just have sex and throw caution to the wind yesterday. But then I was glad I didn&#39;t. But then the OPK this morning and I&#39;m like...ugh...what a waste. But if I&#39;m not ready, I&#39;m not ready, right? I can&#39;t force TTC because of CM and pink lines telling me so. How should I interpret these conflicting feelings? </p>

So I wanted to come on here today and be happy about viability day and complain about my trip to the lab. But my husband was laid off from his job so that's what's on my mind now.

Just the thing you want to happen during pregnancy. He was the breadwinner and took home 2-3 times what I make so we relied on his income for most of our life things. And we were relying on it to support us while I stayed home with the baby.

I know being a SAHM is a luxury for the most part so I feel a bit guilty whining so much about it. But it was my ultimate dream. Like that is my dream job. Being able to stay home and bond and raise my baby myself. The idea was so amazing it was too good to be true. It was something my husband wanted too. He wants me to be with the baby instead of strangers and he wants me to take care of things around the house so we can be together as a family on evenings and weekends instead of packing in all the chores and errands. And I feel so selfish crying about losing that when A) my husband lost his job and all the people he knew and has to find a new job and B) staying home is never even an option for so many people. I just wish leave was longer than 3 months... They're still so little.

Anyways we're not done for, just my dream. We have savings and I'm sure he'll get something else, it may just not be as much money. The company laid off a bunch of people. My husband was part of management and they offered either severance with termination, or to come back at a lower commission based position.

At first I told him to take this other position and look for a new job in the mean time. The severance only is for 5.5 weeks which is not a lot of time to find and start a new job. Taking this position, at a huge pay cut at least for the first several months before he can build up his commission, would at least give us an additional income for as long as it takes to find something else. 

But then I thought, screw them. My husband worked very hard and was good at what he did and cared about that company and they screwed him over. He was told his position was eliminated, but he found out one of the guys who does what he does got to stay. Even though my husband had been doing it longer. So why should he go back to work for them and bring in revenue for them. Also it sounds like the company is tanking so any job there doesn't sound like a great long term solution.

It's a lot of uncertainty at a time where you want things stable. And we had been responsible adults and planned for this baby, but we'd planned on having so much money and now we won't. It was a stressful job, he did so much he was constantly tired and stressed. So who knows, maybe this was a blessing in disguise and he will find something better where he will be happier. I can only hope so. In the meantime I'm starting to collect day care rates... Adding the expense of day care when faced with less money seems counter intuitive, but it looks like it will only eat up half of what I make, so at least it's something. 

I wonder if we'll end up leaving town! If he finds a job paying as much or more than what he was making then I can quit again and nothing is holding us here. I've been wanting to leave for a while... Maybe this will be it. Would be nice to finish out the pregnancy with the same doctor... Idk!!! :(",[],,t1_d6t2ofc,False,0,[],False,"<div class=""md""><p>24+0</p>

I've never ever had any bleeding during either of my pregnancies, not even the stillbirth. No implantation bleeding, after bd bleeding, nothing. So of course I overreacted. It just wasn't something I was expecting to see at 36 weeks. I watches for bleeding like a maniac during the first tri. The problem with bleeding is it can mean nothing, or be really bad. I had had a check to see if I was dialated early yesterday morning so I knew it could be from that, but I always thought if I bled after an exam it would be light or brown and spotting, not a gush and red. So I called my midwife who said that ""we made it too far to have something happen now"" so I should go to labor and delivery (but really, if I wasn't this far would it have not been as serious? It sorta bothered me the way she said it even though I know she had no intention of implying anything). During my NST scan earlier I was having contractions every two minutes, but I was only 1cm dilated so they sent me home. This time the contractions were actually further apart and I wasn't any more dilated, but that is all they checked. I had stopped bleeding by the time I got to the hospital (like I said, it was a gush) so all they did was another cervical check and monitored my contractions and sent me home blaming it on the earlier exam. Sigh. Plus it was dhs first day at his new job so I didn't want to tell him and have him panic and leave work or something until I knew what was going on. I'm glad I waited until I got off to tell him but like me he is bothered that they didn't look into it more. I started bleeding again after I got home from the hospital but if it really is just from the exam it makes sense that I would since they did another one. The thing is I didn't bleed until like 6 hours after the first exam (which wasn't bad at all..my cervix was super low and unlike past cervix checks it wasn't painful at all so of course that's the one I bleed after).

(Tmi warning) Anyhow, dh gets home from work and I happen to go to the bathroom to see if there's still bleeding, and I lose like half of my mucus plug. Or maybe it was the entire thing? I don't even know. But I continued to lose pieces of it all night and some was tinged with blood. Mucus plugs are the one thing I've never heard much about or told what to expect, so yeah. Googling mucus plug led to dry heaving. I have a weak stomach lol. 

Then our neighbors/dhs friend from work comes over with their newborn, and dh proudly freaking announces that I just lost my mucus plug. Like, really? Lol he has no shame. So then they go on to tell me that she lost her mucus plug ten hours before she went into labor. The thing is, she also had the worlds fastest labor. I mean, she literally went from having contractions, deciding they were bad enough that they should head in, to having her water break during the 35 minute drive and the baby being born literally in the car in the parking lot of the hospital. They pulled up, her husband ran in to get someone, and when he came back she had her pants off and was crowning. They're famous at the hospital right now haha. The baby is absolutely adorable though and doing really well.

So that's where I'm at. It's now 6:15am, dh is already at work, and I just want the next few weeks to be over with already. And I thought the pregnancy would get less stressful around now..haaa. ",[],,t1_d6t1ta8,False,0,[],False,"<div class=""md""><p>So after having what I thought was a fairly good visit with my midwife for once yesterday, I went over to my moms and while I was there I felt a gush and went to the bathroom and there was blood everywhere. I&#39;ve never ever had any bleeding during either of my pregnancies, not even the stillbirth. No implantation bleeding, after bd bleeding, nothing. So of course I overreacted. It just wasn&#39;t something I was expecting to see at 36 weeks. I watches for bleeding like a maniac during the first tri. The problem with bleeding is it can mean nothing, or be really bad. I had had a check to see if I was dialated early yesterday morning so I knew it could be from that, but I always thought if I bled after an exam it would be light or brown and spotting, not a gush and red. So I called my midwife who said that &quot;we made it too far to have something happen now&quot; so I should go to labor and delivery (but really, if I wasn&#39;t this far would it have not been as serious?

I&#39;m going in there today, but I think it&#39;s just talking about possible future pregnancies and what will happen then, not a physical check. But it seems my body is not yet done with the last pregnancy. Feels like it may need a kickstart, or I could use it at least. Just to feel some control and some sense of being normal, being me. </p>

<p>I guess I just feel bummed that I again am in the most unlucky group. And while it helps to know I&#39;m not alone, it does feel unfair to be playing this waiting game while I&#39;d rather play another. </p>

Since so many appointments recently have been scheduled last minute, I haven't been able to get in to see her. We listened to the heartbeat for a while (153!) and talked about everything that's going on. She said that she was so excited for the good FISH results, but that the next 5-6 weeks would still be very hard while we wait on more results and to see baby's heart. We talked about what happens if something comes back on the rest of the CVS and microarray results and what will happen if there's a heart issue.

I really thought it would never come back and that I had permanently messed something up internally. Have you been checked for retained tissue? Have your hcg levels been checked? Usually with retained tissue you won't stop bleeding for a long time, and it can prevent your hcg from dropping back down to zero. Your body won't be able to start its cycle again until your hcg is very low, if not at zero. Other than retained tissue there are some other reasons why hcg sometimes takes a long time to drop. For example, with molar pregnancies. Or sometimes people just take a while. I took a pregnancy test three weeks after my loss and it was negative, but that doesn't mean there wasn't still a small amount of hcg left that was too little for the test to pick up. 

Also, I didn't have retained tissue. My doctor really isn't sure why my body took so long to get its shit  together. When I went to my 6 week post partum visit and was still bleeding lightly on and off, my doctor had me schedule a follow up appointment to make sure the bleeding had stopped. At the follow up appointment the bleeding had stopped but still no period, so he had me schedule an ultrasound to check for retained tissue. At the ultrasound I found out that there was nothing retained, but the doctor also was able to see a 2cm follicle on my left ovary meaning I was going to ovulate soon. He was also able to see that my uterine lining was nice and thick, so he gave us the light to try that cycle even though my period hadn't returned yet. 

Some people just take longer than others. While most people do get their periods back within a few weeks after their loss there are still the unlucky ones that fall to the far end of normal on the scale, like you and me. I never had any problems with my period (it was always like clockwork and was fairly light and lasted the same amount of time every month practically to the minute) and I just wanted it to start back up so I could have some sense of normalcy. I know how horrible the waiting is and how frustrating it can be when you feel like your own body is against you and you have no control. Be gentle on yourself, you've been through a lot and your body is healing. Keep good communication with your doctor and make your concerns known. I have heard of cases where a doctor will prescribe a month or two of birth control to get things back on track but I personally given the option would rather give it some time and try to wait it out. I'm so sorry you're going through this, and for your loss. It's a difficult place to be at. I hope your body decides to cooperate soon and you find some peace of mind.

Hopefully the midwife will have the full report back from the mfms interpretation of the ultrasound and it is reassuring. I hope everyone has a good, as-peaceful-as-possible monday. 

UPDATE: appointment went good, mfm reviewed the ultrasound and said he thinks the hc is closer to the 50th percentile (he actually said between 54 and 55). So yay. Also, I'm a whole 1cm dilated! Midwife said my cervix is very 'ripe' and that she would be very surprised if I made it to my due date. She said she thinks she'll see me next week (my appointment on monday) but if she had to guess she said she thinks he will be here between one and two weeks from now based on my cervix and the contractions I've been having.

I also suffered 4 losses between October and June, I also live across the country from my brother and his wife, and I'm also 32F.  My SIL is not currently pregnant though (gave birth a few months ago), so I'm going to guess you're not her :)

With all of that said, I think other posters did a good job explaining that you can't fit your SIL's emotions into a neat little package that will make your pregnancy more enjoyable.  It's also very unlikely that your SIL will magically feel better and be suddenly overjoyed for you if she becomes pregnant again.  That's just... not how pregnancy works for most people after four losses.  

I've become an aunt three times since my first loss last year.  My husband's two siblings each had a child, and my brother and SIL had their second child.  I wasn't super involved in my husband's families pregnancies, perhaps because they were trying to shield me, but I was delighted and thrilled to welcome all the babies into our family.  My reaction is neither ""good"" nor ""bad""... it's just how I reacted, and it could have easily gone the other way.

My SIL has no siblings, so she and I talked regularly about her pregnancy.  She asked me to let her know if I ever felt uncomfortable, and she always made sure to ask how my life was going.  She even taught my parents to ask about my beloved dogs when they talked to me, because she knew I was (at times) grasping at things to be happy about.

The way she handled her pregnancy, including me as I felt comfortable and backing-off if she sensed I was overwhelmed, brought us a lot closer.  I'm so grateful that she never tried to force me into feeling a certain way.  She would have completely understood if I couldn't feel happy or involved in her pregnancy.  And she goes out of her way to learn about my life and how she can help.

I'm sure you are looking for ways to improve your life (who isn't, right?), but I feel like your approach is pretty off.  Her struggle is 0% about you, and instead of being understanding of her limitations, you threw around ""PTSD"" as an explanation. Your SIL has gone through something really traumatic, and she's doing the best she can.  Asking her to also make you feel good is not realistic.

Wishing you and your family all the best, and hoping for a happy and healthy pregnancy for you.

I recognise them, so I wanted to share my journey with this. It has been quite a journey so this is a bit long, sorry. First and foremost I went to a therapist for a few years and that has been invaluable for me - it is a big step but I always look back with gratitude that I made it. So if you sometimes think about seeing someone, give it a try.  

My story with fear:
Before my loss I struggled with these fears, because of a lot of other events that had a huge impact and I didn't had control over (losing my dad one of them). I went to therapy for years, and I was talking about those fears, especially losing my (now) husband, a lot. That resurfaced when we lost Kate. My therapist let me complete my thoughts: If I thought about my husband not coming home, I had to visualise being told he was dead, organising his funeral, how my friends would help me and be there for me, how I would have a long and hard road to recovering and healing enough to live on, but in the end, live on. For me, that helped. It wasn't taking away the fear itself, but it showed me I would get through whatever happened. Slowly but surely the fears were diminishing.

The thing is, it can happen. You can wake up one day with everything going great and going to bed that night in a totally different life. We know: we lived it, so I think it is natural to feel that sense of loss of control and be scared by it. 

The way I see it it isn't really loss of control - it is coming to the realisation control is in fact an illusion. Losing Kate really brought that home to me. I'm seeing my own mortality a lot more clearer as well, and the fact that we all will lose each other in the end. In some way it has been a spiritual realisation for me. This wisdom (from a Buddhist monk) had a profound impact on me in the last months:

""The bad news is you are falling through the air, nothing to hold on to, no parachute. The good news is there is no ground.""

The last three months or so I&#39;ve been a lot more consistent and I&#39;ve been researching a lot more and meal planning and following YouTube gurus etc. - he turned to me last night and said, &quot;Do you realize that for the first time in YEARS you have a hobby?&quot;</p>

<p>WHOA. My life has basically consisted of work and family and my toddler for so long I haven&#39;t had something I do for me for YEARS. YEARS, guys. And the gym thing was totally something my husband has been trying to convince me to do forever and I kind of fell into it without making a conscious decision, you know?</p>

<p>Anyway, feeling pretty good about it. I&#39;m progressing slowly but nicely. AF should be here Monday and it&#39;ll be the first one after the most recent MC. I&#39;ll feel a little bit of closure. Waiting on the karyotyping results. Things are looking up. Hope you all have a wonderful weekend. </p>

<p>So, hi. I&#39;m A and I&#39;m 31. I&#39;m terrified of this and full of anxiety 24/7. I had an <a href=""/u/s"">u/s</a> Wednesday that went well, but my nausea went away completely and now I&#39;m convinced it&#39;s another loss. I&#39;m hoping so hard I&#39;m wrong - will hopefully find out next Wednesday when I have an appointment with an RPL specialist RE. (Made before I got pregnant.)</p>

I had the worst anxiety attack last night. Like probably the worst I've ever had. And I was pregnant for it... Poor baby... I hope she's OK.

It started before bed, I was having trouble breathing well. We looked up the symptoms and it sounded like normal pregnancy shortness of breath. So I tried to get it out of my head. Tried to feel normal. Took a shower. Tried relaxing and breathing calmly.

It didn't help. My husband was practically asleep when it really hit. I was sobbing in a panicked sort of gaspy way. I couldn't control it, I tried. I tried calming my breathing and taking deep breaths, but I'd get overwhelmed by uncontrollable sobs.

My poor husband tried a bunch of things to help me. We ended up waking the dog up, sitting on the couch. 

Of course I couldn't sleep after, still couldn't breathe. I was able to sleep eventually, but not good sleep, and woke up early.

I applaud your self-restraint with the interaction with your MIL, I don't know if I have it in me to do the same! Our relationship with my MIL is strained at best and I am fresh out of patience with her inability to be supportive or empathetic with our losses (we've been married 8 years, together 10, and none of this is new or surprising). She has this superhuman ability to make everything about her. I didn't even want to tell her about our last MC.

Our relationship with my MIL is strained at best and I am fresh out of patience with her inability to be supportive or empathetic with our losses (we&#39;ve been married 8 years, together 10, and none of this is new or surprising). She has this superhuman ability to make everything about her. I didn&#39;t even want to tell her about our last MC. </p>

First off, I'm so sorry for your loss. You're a nice husband to come seek info here. I just went through a very similar thing in June/July/Aug. Aside from the pseudo sac, your wife's experience is a lot like mine. 

I had a shot of methotrexate after bleeding and spotting for 26 days. I continued to spot (and did have an actual period) for 17 days after the shot. My numbers did drop 18% from day 4 - day 7 after the shot so I didn't have to have another one, but my hcg was low - not even close to the 200s. My situation was this:  positive test June 18, and bleeding began about a week later. Hcg was 21 and then 8. Thought it was a CP, mourned, and went to doc for some repeat loss bloodwork. Hcg was 8.5 which alarmed him. A week later 7, and then 4.5, and then it jumped to 45, and then 37. At that point we went with the methotrexate. Nothing could be seen on ultrasound and I was diagnosed with PUL as well. It is so frustrating to not know what's going on in ones body. 

After the shot, my hcg went from 37 to 30 to 7 to &lt;1 - and this took over a month. It was not until Aug 9 that my hcg was at normal levels after the metho. I tested with Wondfos throughout this time and they became negative a few days before my last blood draw confirmed my &lt;1 hcg. The spotting stopped for good a few days after the negative Wondfo. So I had 40 some days of spotting/bleeding and 17 of that was after the methotrexate. My numbers are low and it's likely your wife's are taking a while to go down because she had a higher hcg and pseudo sac. 

Given my experience I would NOT ignore the spotting. It is the only thing that would have alerted me that something was wrong if I had not already made doc appts. My original obgyn did two blood draws (the one that ended at 8) and sent me on my way. I would have not known if went down and back up without the spotting. If I were you guys, I'd test with sensitive home pregnancy tests for maybe another week or two. Wondfos gave me a faint line with an hcg of 7. This is to ensure your wife's hcg isn't shooting back up. From what I've read, we can spot when after hcg returns to normal as the body continues to rid itself of the lining it built up. In terms of a period, mine came while my hcg was still elevated and almost on time - about a month after the bleeding from the loss/first positive pregnancy test. But I don't think my situation is typical - my loss was SO early. I had an appointment yesterday and he diagnosed me with ""probably ectopic in the tube"" but we really have no evidence of that. I'm just going to throw out an ""if I were you guys"" scenario based on all of my insane research over the past 2.5 months:  I'd 1) test with Wondfos every few days/once a week to make sure the hcg is not rising, 2) monitor the spotting and if it doesn't stop in 2 weeks I'd call the doc, 3) I'd worry less about a period coming because our bodies are ALL kinds of out of whack after loss. Maybe if no period comes DURING the spotting and/or after the spotting stops I'd also call the doc. 

I hope this helps! Because your wife had higher hcg and had the sac it might take longer for all of this to resolve, unfortunately. I found very little info about spotting after negative blood tests, so it's hard to be sure if something is wrong or its normal. Good luck to you both in the future &lt;3 ",[],,t1_d6nxocz,False,0,[],False,"<div class=""md""><p>Warning:  novel ahead </p>

Hello and welcome to another edition of Posts From 3AM. I'll be your host, yesbabyplz. I woke up because I couldn't breathe again :-/

Collected all my lab essentials yesterday. I have an orange glucose drink for Monday morning. I have a urine collection hat and jug. The jug is not as big as I imagined. I might have to lower my water consumption on collection day, which will be Sunday.

Felt kind of poopy yesterday and came home to elevated BP. Now was I anxious from not feeling well, or not feeling well from high BP?? Highest home reading ever, 150/80. I tried to chill and ate a muffin and 20 min later it was down to 135, so I guess I'm ok. Not cool though.

And now here I am waking up unable to breathe again. I even got out of bed to check my BP because the nurse always asks if I take it during episodes of shortness of breath. Not super high.

Oh!! Our baby shower invites arrived! They are super cute, my sister did a good job and obliged our request for theme and color and the design is wonderful and adorable. None of our friends have said anything receiving it yet, but they should be if we got ours. Now let's see if anything gets bought off that registry....

<p>Collected all my lab essentials yesterday. I have an orange glucose drink for Monday morning. I have a urine collection hat and jug. The jug is not as big as I imagined. I might have to lower my water consumption on collection day, which will be Sunday.</p>

<p>Felt kind of poopy yesterday and came home to elevated BP. Now was I anxious from not feeling well, or not feeling well from high BP?? Highest home reading ever, 150/80. I tried to chill and ate a muffin and 20 min later it was down to 135, so I guess I&#39;m ok. Not cool though.</p>

<p>And now here I am waking up unable to breathe again. I even got out of bed to check my BP because the nurse always asks if I take it during episodes of shortness of breath. Not super high.</p>

<p>Oh!! Our baby shower invites arrived! They are super cute, my sister did a good job and obliged our request for theme and color and the design is wonderful and adorable. None of our friends have said anything receiving it yet, but they should be if we got ours. Now let&#39;s see if anything gets bought off that registry.... Although the shower is not till the beginning of November. Amazon emails you if something gets bought, right?</p>

I am slightly different, having had 4 early losses in 14 months. It's weird to say I haven't been pregnant in a year, and June marked 2 years TTC. 
I've just had surgery to remove scar tissue and have officially got the go ahead to try again when my period returns (which it did 4 days ago) 

I have been In a state of waiting for over a year. First I waited for the biopsy/scope, then I waited for the call from the specialist, then I waited for the surgery, now I'm waiting for my period to finish, then I'll wait to see if I actually conceive, then I'll wait to see how long that pregnancy will last because I can't even say if the surgery fixed the problem.  

TTC is a big long state of purgatory and for some of us it sucks. 

Take this time to take care of yourself. It doesn't feel like it now, but there's a reason you want to wait and get fit. I didn't meet my weight loss goal but I did lose some weight and haven't gained it back. Take what progress you can and don't be too hard on yourself if you don't hit your goal.

My husband and I have talked a lot about our daughter and her possible lack of siblings.  He has two, a brother and sister, and he points out that while he is close to his brother, he isn&#39;t close to his sister. And my brother and I aren&#39;t really close.</p>

<p>But I tell him that when my mom was terminally ill and then when she died, my brother and I talked a lot.  And it was nice to have him, someone who grew up with my mom and knew her like I did, to talk to about all the horrible things that went with her illness.  </p>

<p>Like most people, the lack of control in this whole process really gets to me.  I&#39;m so used to being in charge and getting stuff done.  I might need to learn to let go a little. :)</p>

Depression is a very real and very serious thing. Hopefully hers is situational and temporary, but she may need some help. And she definitely needs understanding.

There are some studies that show that women who suffer miscarriages and fall into depression are usually able to pull themselves out after a year -- thats a year from the last loss, not the first. Think about that...a YEAR of depression, slowly improving. That's a long time. That's hard on HER.  Yes, being around a depressed person is hard. Definitely. But there's only so much you can do. Even if you just Google how to help someone with depression, you get this:

* Be there to listen. Make conversations about what they're going through easy and open. (you've tried)
* Accept their condition. (hard to do)
* Get informed. (looks like you need to read up on it!)
* Encourage them to get help. (Super iffy...possibly have her husband do it)
* Back down if they aren't ready. (this...this has to happen)

Your SIL isn't ready. She can't help that much right now. And it can't be forced. You can't expect her to grin and bear it...and saying that you have other friends who have done so means nothing. You even say how you reacted after miscarriage. Well, she is not you. She is not those friends. Nobody is the same. She is obviously struggling and trying to compare her to others and insinuate that she should snap out of it is hurtful and wrong and won't be helpful at all.

There are things you can do when you're near a depressed person, too. [Read this](http://au.reachout.com/helping-a-friend-with-depression). Find other articles to help you cope with her, if you need to. There are plenty with how to deal with your own hurt feelings about how she is treating you. But you can't change how she's feeling. =/ 

As you said, you are having a hard time digesting what she's going through. That's because you cannot understand. You had a loss, and that's horrible and sad. But she's had 4 AND she is a DIFFERENT person. She isn't you. No one person can fully understand the other's feelings, even if they've both had the same amount of miscarriages/etc. We're all different.

It's understandable to take it personally. Nobody thinks its wrong of you to be hurt by it. I just urge you to TRY not to take it so personally...its really not about you in the least. :( 

It sucks that she can't be there for you. It sucks that you and your husband have tried to be there for her and she is rejecting it. It just all around sucks. But pregnancy loss and depression both super suck and that likely isn't going to change. You sound concerned for her well being...and that's important. She likely needs that. But with depression sometimes you can't force anything. 

I'd talk to her husband if you can...see if she is seeking any help. See if he even realizes she *should be* seeking help. He is the most likely person to be able to get her the help.

Had my appointment with my OB/Surgeon guy.

* Advised me not to temp or use OPKs and to bang between CD10 and 20, every other day. Wow so revolutionary knowledge.
* Gave me a requisition for a sonohysterosalpingogram, to be done on CD10/11 of next cycle. Guess it's finally time to see if that left tube is actually functional. 
* Oh look yep, your hormones and blood results are all totally normal. 
* Gave me the same line about how my body needs time to ""heal"" after the ectopic *in January*. 
* At least my endocervical polyp seems to have vanished and everything else seems as normal as ever. Lining measured 7.8mm (which seems low?), ovaries and uterus normal. 
* Gave husband a requisition for a SA. Who knows when that will get done. We don't have the money to pay for it out of pocket right now, and the VA will probably take 7,000 years to figure their shit out enough for him to have a damn SA on their dime. 
* I could tell that he could tell that I was losing my shit and he was obviously not sure how to feel about that. 

Also, I hate his office. I made the earliest appointment possible. I asked if he was double booked (they said no). I still had to wait 40 minutes to see him. His office is literally PLASTERED with pictures of healthy, chubby babies and beaming parents. Like... hundreds of photos of them. Innumerable photos of my OB looking nonplussed and holding a brand new swaddled human up for the camera. Sitting in his waiting room feels like a game of Keep Talking and No One Explodes. Except... I feel like I'm constantly exploding. I'm sitting there, desperately chewing my nicotine gum, white-knuckle grabbing the shitty plastic arm rests, watching the door as woman after woman comes in; some with big round bellies, some with babies, others that look like me. I'm going over in my head all the things I want to scream at him. I'm going over in my head all the ways in which I'm a failure. 

Let's play a game called ""Only Want One Thing and Fail At It Consistently"". 

Yesterday was rough. I've been having mood swings. More like mood earthquakes. So much anxiety. So much depression. And then, out of nowhere, a few hours of unbridled happiness and energy. And then a crash back to the constant feelings of failure and existential angst. 

Spotting yesterday. No spotting today, but BFN at 12dpo. Temps still up. I'm feeling hopeless. 

Wondering if I'll be G2P0 forever (G1P0 if you don't count the CP I had the cycle before the ectopic). 

Like... I don't even know how to deal with myself. This is how I remember feeling as a teenager and young adult, but now I don't have my self-destructive coping strategies to help me deal with this horrible, searing, unending pain. No drugs, no cutting, no drinking, no awful boyfriends. Just me, and my husband, and my cats. And eternity.

It did suck a lot actually waking up when DHs alarm went off at 4:30 though!</p>

I know the fertility doctor told me specifically that heavy weight lifting increases testosterone, so I'm trying to keep it light (but I have to add some back due to some lingering physical therapy issues). I would guess that perhaps at 60 miles your body is in a mode of repairing so much tissue damage (which, of course, is the point of exercise) on a daily basis in order to improve function that perhaps that's taking a front seat to other bodily processes? Again, I'm no expert but I do know from my own experience that my body will choose to prioritize what it needs to...for example, when I've gotten really stressed at work my cycles are longer (and my thyroid tests showed higher levels, and since that's controlled by the adrenal gland which is affected by stress and since thyroid levels can affect fertility...you get the picture of where my mind goes).


I started yoga 6 years ago because of stress and added it to my running, and it's been a lifesaver for me. I started with just a Gaiam 15-minute beginner's DVD. When that got stale, I tried several studios in town until I found one that I liked and have been going there off-and-on ever since. Nowadays I do a few classes a week (both the strong and sweaty as well as the relaxing and stretchy) and feel so much better overall. It really improves my running and lifting, too (when I'm doing that). I also do my own routine and/or DVDs (check out the fertility yoga dvd series on Amazon--it's pretty good and only about 30 minutes long--very light and stretchy, and one dvd for each phase of your cycle).  


I had a hard time adjusting after the birth of my daughter. As I told my friend, you're not who you were before, at all.

I was crying, the ultrasound lady was pretty much on the brink of tears, my husband was absolutely fine because he wasn&#39;t expecting anything else. We got a picture printed, which was a lovely bonus that I wasn&#39;t expecting. Also, baby was measuring 9+6, when I thought I was 9+1, so that&#39;s kind of weird. It feels like we&#39;ve skipped a whole week, like yesterday I was 9+0 and tomorrow I&#39;ll be 10+0. But, there&#39;s nothing wrong with that!</p>

I'll start off by saying that I agree 100% with everyone's comments, so I don't think I need to echo that there's nothing you can do to bring your sister in law around. However, I do want to acknowledge that it's OKAY for you to be sad about this. You are excited about your pregnancy and you want your family to be as well - and you want to talk about it. Just as no one ever deserves to have a miscarriage and have their dreams of pregnancy be ruined, no one deserves to not be able to fully experience the joy of their pregnancy and shout it from the rooftops to their friends and family. Unfortunately, the sad reality of miscarriage makes it otherwise. I know you really want her to be okay and be over it. And you want to talk about with her, and, of course, for her to be involved with your child's life. Trust me that she likely wants that as well and probably feels guilty for not being able to. I used to read articles about friendships being torn apart due to miscarriage and pregnancy and I would say, ""that will never happen to me and my friends.""  I didn't understand it at ALL. I said to myself, ""if I were in that situation I'd be strong, I'd be there for my friends because they deserve to be happy when pregnant. I'd grin and bear it.""  I was wrong. I never thought a miscarriage would impact my relationship with my bff, but it has. It's sad. It's so so sad. And it's okay for you to mourn that, too. You just have to try to figure out how to do that separately from her. Part of the reason I purposely ask about my friends babies and make sure I'm involved is because I want to have that around me when it's my turn and when I'm happy. But it's HARD. Its going to be hard until I have a baby and then I'll still never forget. But I am still in a place where I am saying ""When it's my turn..."" Your SIL is likely beginning to worry that she won't have babies. I cannot imagine what going through 4 feels like. I don't ever want to have to imagine it, but, I would probably act exactly as she is. I'd be devastated that I couldn't be there for my family and friends, but I'd be detached and avoidant as well. It's just a mountain of sadness and guilt piled on top of that. 

If you guys are really close, can you write her notes about your pregnancy and never deliver them? Maybe as time passes, if she eventually gets pregnant and feels in a strong place, she'll be up for reading them. Sometimes I think that can be really helpful. Or talk to your husband and friends about how unfortunate the whole situation is. Looking at the alumni thread may also help to see how those that have gone on to have healthy pregnancies deal with friends/family having miscarriages at the same time.

Just woke up in the middle of the night feeling terrible. I haven't felt like this in over a week since I started my new medication, so I wonder what could be causing it?? Body felt heavy, hard to breath particularly while laying down. And it was much harder on one side than the other. 

Yesterday I scheduled my glucose test and BP work up. I'm picking up the glucose drink tomorrow and made the blood draw appointment for Monday. So it sounds like i drink the glucose at home an hour before the appointment so I don't have to sit around there. 

I'm also getting labs for my blood pressure, which i think includes checking iron which I'm glad about. A few people around here have suggested some of my physical problems may be from anemia. Also I have to do a 24 urine collection! Fun! /s It has to be refrigerated so nighttime peeing sounds fun. I'm getting the jug tomorrow too and plan to collect Sunday so I can do those labs on Monday too.

I'm glad they are on top of monitoring me, but at the same time it feels like a lot happening at once. And I feel like they're certain I'll get GD and pre e and they're just waiting for it to happen.

In the past few years, my reaction to any ""harm"" that could come from my running levels and intensity was basically putting my hands over my ears and saying la la la la la la la la la la la! And I appreciate a perspective from someone who understands the emotions that are wrapped up in it for me.

Your perspective about being flexible with identity and routine now to prepare for having a newborn was eye opening and I had certainly not considered it that way. My daily routine is so set, and while I don't get as rustled about a change as I did in the past, I still have room to grow in the routine flexibility area!

I'm noticing that my cycles are long, and I wonder if dialing back volume and intensity could potentially help shorten them? Total shot in the dark, but sometimes I wonder if my hormones and ovulation are being interrupted by my running regimen. One thing that has me wondering as well is my cousin, who also ran (not as much or as intense, but she was a regular). She had a loss April 2015, and when she reached out to me after my loss, we talked about running. She said her cycles had been all over the place, and the doctor recommended she not run to see if that would help. She is expecting her first in January now, and I am so happy for her. I don't mean to take her doctor's advice and apply directly to myself, but being that we are family, I wonder if there are physiological similarities between us concerning fertility.

I made up a sample week of training and included three days a week of yoga. I feel like I could have a lot to benefit from yoga and I really love your insight that it gave you a similar feeling with endorphins. 

Again, thank you for all the information and advice you provided! It will go a long way in helping me proceed in a healthy manner.

I don't know what the right thing to do is, and hearing the experiences of others only helps. I guess I just worry that I'm unknowingly pushing past the barrier of healthy exercise to intensive exercise. I've struggled to find that line several times in the past and have way over-worked myself because of it. It sucks to worry if I'm getting in the way of my dream of motherhood when I'm enjoying a long run. 

At this point, I think my first resort will be to dial back intensity and frequency of long runs. I drew up a sample week of training (because I'm that dork) of backed off training, and I'm going to think about it awhile longer, and talk to my mom and husband before I make any decisions. Once we move, I hope it will be easier to run less because I have easy access to a pool and maybe I can get into swimming?

I also want to speak to a doctor, but I don't really know where I'd go right now. I don't have a GP since moving, and we are moving again late next month. I wish I could visit my GP back in IL who has known me almost my whole life. Would it be weird if I called the practice and asked for a conversation with that doctor? 

By the way, I absolutely love how you said you bonded with baby. I did something similar while I was pregnant, when I felt any discomfort I would start walking and put my hand on my lower stomach. 

I think at this point, I am trying to find some measure of control in this journey that doesn't drive me crazy like charting did. Again, thank you so much for sharing your perspective and your story.

<p>From there, we went on to a saline ultrasound, a hysteroscopy, and a uterine biopsy (all of which came back normal, so...ugh and yay?).  Have you done any of those?</p>

<p>I&#39;ve tried to see my testing being normal as a blessing...and an encouraging fact. Before testing, I felt that getting pregnant again was like playing roulette with the baby. Now I feel a BIT more confident that I have the chance to have a normal pregnancy and a healthy baby. </p>

Second...this is gonna get long. hah Sorry?

I need to ask, and you may not like it and I don't mean to offend, but are you looking for how to make this easier on you...or her? It honestly sounds like you're more concerned with how it affects you, your relationship with her, and your child than you are about how much SHE is struggling. I hope that's not the case. And if its not, then I'd suggest you may need to be incredibly careful of your wording when you do talk to her. 

Your SIL likely IS struggling horribly. I can imagine, because with my 3 losses I fully understand not doing well with other's pregnancies. Or baby related information/items. And I do know all of my due dates and they make me sad. I am not sure of the extent that your SIL is struggling, but its likely not abnormal. That's a lot to happen, and in a relatively short time. Having the same hopefulness and then heartbreak over and over its tiring - physically and emotionally. As you have experienced loss, also, you know what that feeling is...but to have it repeated over and over is downright disheartening. To go months and sometimes years without getting your dream is HARD. From my own experiences, I'd guess she is not only mourning her losses but also feeling like she may never have a baby...and that hurts. So much. Even if its not true, many of us feel it...and that changes our entire thought process on pregnancy. Its not usually personal towards you...and it could change once you have the baby. Or it might not. But she's probably in a mental place right now where she needs to protect herself to keep her sanity. That hurts other relationships, for sure, but sometimes its necessary. Right now you have the one thing she likely wants the most. It's hard to see that or hear about it. MANY people will be there for you during your happy time...she maybe can't be. And she likely has few people who are there for her in a way she needs.

My biggest piece of advice is this -- Please do not try to ""force"" pregnancy talk on her. There really is no reason that you need to talk to her about it. You have others you can talk to about that. MANY pregnant women don't seem to realize that they bring it up entirely too often...in topics where it really isn't necessary. Just randomly in conversation. We get that pregnancy takes over your life...AND that it's an incredible time for the pregnant woman. But slight, random mentions can throw some of us off.  Just be careful what you mention and steer clear of pregnancy and baby talk. I know you said you aren't talking about it to her....but I know my friends mention their pregnancies in numerous ways without meaning to or realizing it. All the time. So its just something to be cognizant of.

Now, I do also suggest that you ask her what she wants. Maybe she DOES want you to talk about it...or give her the chance. And feels weird that you're avoiding it. Hard to say. Here's what I would do --  when she is NOT at work or some other function, and you are sure she is free, I'd suggest a conversation where you tell her that you understand she is hurting and understand that your pregnancy is likely triggering. But that you lover her, she's the aunt, and you don't want to exclude her from information *if she wants it*...and then ask if she DOES want it. Suggest that if she does want to hear things, that you can message her during her usually free hours and ASK if she wants to hear an update. Tell her you won't ever just give the update, talk about it, or send a photo. Tell her you can ask if its a good time and if she is interested. AND tell her that you'll understand if she says no, she isn't interested and/or its not a good time. And then...have that be true!! You have to not take it personally if she says its not an ok time or she doesn't want to know. Sadly, that's her own issue and you can't do a lot about that. But your reaction to it can be controlled. She is hurting. You are happy. It's extra hard to deal with your own pain while you watch others get pregnant, be happy, and pass you by. If she caa't handle the information, its best that you don't share it anyway. It will hurt her AND her reaction will likely hurt you.  (I'd also suggest asking how she'd like to know when the baby arrives/etc...those ""she's here!"" type messages can be a huge whammy).

Whatever way THAT conversation goes, I'd attempt to have a relationship with her. One that does NOT include baby or pregnancy talk (like I said). I'm not sure what your relationship was like before all this, but if you normally chat about regular ole life, then go on doing that. IF you didn't do that before, try it!

AND...ask her how SHE is doing and if she needs to talk or needs anything. Many times after losses you get a lot of support up front/right away and then it dies down...she may be feeling lost and lonely. And likely feeling like she can't bring it up to you since you're pregnant. 

Unfortunately she is likely not capable of being there for you during the pregnancy. That can't be forced. And shouldn't be, since she is struggling. Try to be supportive and loving about her needs, too....even if she doesn't seem to care about yours. She likely does care and feels incredibly guilty that she isn't involved and can't be there for you. My bff is pregnant and I've been way more distant that I really want to be -- if she was pregnant before my losses this would have been entirely different...and that makes me feel BAD. But I just can't talk to her about it much.

I have had breakthrough bleeding the last two months a few days before AF, which I did have the past three days or so on and off.  I don't think it was implantation bleeding.

I debate on whether I am 11 or 12 DPO, because I got my positive OPK on a Friday, and I decided to consider Saturday the date of ovulation since the LH surge can be before it, so I am considering Sunday to be Day 1.  I think I have a UTI so I&#39;m going in for my annual well woman exam this afternoon.  I worry that there is something wrong with me.

My cycle has been 24 days the last two months, and yesterday was CD24, so I was expecting AF today.  I did take RRL this cycle religiously, so it may have lengthened my cycle.  I have had breakthrough bleeding the last two months a few days before AF, which I did have the past three days or so on and off.  I don&#39;t think it was implantation bleeding.

I&#39;ve improved my diet, am using bath products with no pthalates, am taking ubiquinol, doing meditation, etc. </p>

<p>I understand the fear--I&#39;m right there with you. Keep sharing in this community if you feel comfortable; I&#39;ve found the support really helps.</p>

I still can't let myself hold babies in the extended family--it hurts too much. 


Regarding the running...about 15 years ago I used to run a lot, too. Six miles a day, 6-7 days a week. I miss that endorphin rush that used to kick in after mile 3. I miss the fact I could eat anything and not gain weight. And it was like my journaling time--I could let things that were bothering me work themselves out. I get it. :) 


I can tell this is a really hard decision for you--there's a lot of emotions wrapped up in running. It sounds like it is part of your identity, and I'm guessing the fear is in part the fear of not recognizing yourself because your routine would be different (total armchair psychology here, btw :0 ). I have another runner friend/working mom friend who faced similar fears--we talked through the fact that your routines and identity would change so much upon having a newborn, it can't hurt to consider how to be more flexible now. After having my daughter, I thought I'd be out with the jogging stroller at 6 weeks. Nope. It took almost 7 months for that to happen.


Some people will probably say to keep running just as much. Not to be a downer, but I do notice a difference in my cycles when I'm exercising too heavily. (I also used to lift heavy.) In meeting with the fertility doctor this summer, she did caution me against over-exercising and did say it's a really sensitive balance. She recommended to me that the yoga and walking I was already doing every day was the best for conception. 


Yet because I know the joys of a long run, I feel bad in sharing that doctor's advice...so please take it for what it's worth. Question: yoga is really good for me, it gives me that similar body-release/endorphin feeling after a 75-minute class...could you start doing that? And do one long run on the weekends?

I had long most exhausting and ugly cry that I've had in months. Looking at that picture just makes me feel like such a failure. At least he gets home from his business trip tonight. It has been a lonely week.

I'm starting to ponder the ugly truth that I may need to sincerely cut back on running if I want to get pregnant and have a healthy pregnancy and baby. I know there are plenty of women who can exercise a bunch and have a healthy baby, but I'm wondering if I'm not one of those people. The month I had my CP, I was running close to 60 miles per week. When I got pregnant the next cycle, I had cut down to 25-30 miles per week. And during the month I knew I was pregnant, I cut back to run-walk intervals.

I'm certainly not at an unhealthy weight at 5'2"", 113 lbs., but I can't help but fear that running every day is hurting my fertility. Maybe it is just an irrational fear, because everything I've read says you should be able to keep your fitness regimen when you get pregnant, just don't take on any additional exercise. I have been active my whole life, and have been a distance runner the past almost six years, so I thought I should be able to keep on running, get pregnant, and have a healthy pregnancy. Maybe I've been doing too much of a good thing.

I've read a few articles recently though that said distance running and marathon training could be hurting my fertility, and that scares the crap out of me. Cutting back on running is terrifying for me too, since it is my main source of self-confidence (and also how I can justify eating and sleeping as much as I do). I've gone back and forth several times in my head with saying that I will cut back so I can have a better chance at getting pregnant, and running as much as I want because it is frustrating to put something I love on hold for TTC, especially when doctors recommend being active and fit when trying for a baby.

In the past month or so, I've been around 35-40 miles per week, and I've really been enjoying it! It gives me time to think and clear my head. To quote Elle Woods ""exercise gives you endorphins, endorphins make you happy!"" And I feel really good about myself when I'm running and after I get done. But I'm scared that my love and passion for running doesn't fit with what I desperately want the most - a baby.

Scan yesterday went well. Baby is 1lb 4oz and in the 47th percentile for size. They were good with that. We're getting growth scans every four weeks going forward because of my high blood pressure and risk of pre eclampsia puts baby at risk for decreased growth. Which is scary to think about.

Oh the tech freaked me out because she said I should be feeling her more than I am! During the scan baby rolled over and she asked if I felt that and I didn't! Idk what to say?? Overall baby looks ok I guess so maybe that's ok too.

My miscarriage was a few months back now. I am a paediatric and neonatal nurse. Most of the babies and children I see at work are loved and wanted so I realise this doesn't compare with your work in child protective services, but I feel working with babies and children in any scenario makes our loss so much harder. People talk about avoiding babies / baby showers etc until you've healed - but there's no avoiding them if you work with them every day!! It is just the most constant, in-your-face reminder of what you've lost. 

In the days following my miscarriage, I remember looking after a newborn twin whose mother had taken the other twin home but wasn't coping so was just refusing to pick the other one up. I also cared for a mother who had been through years of IVF and finally had her baby but was completely not coping with any of its basic cares and taking it out on the nurses and I felt so angry, thinking if she wanted a baby so bad, she should know how to care for it! It was all messing with me so much and I accepted I wasn't coping. I realised I needed to ""be kind to myself"" and take some time away so I took nearly 3 weeks off. It certainly didn't fix everything but I definitely needed it and it did help. So if you're in a position to do the same, I highly recommend it. 

In terms of getting through it all, I honestly don't have any answers yet. I have never struggled to cope with anything in my life as much as this. But I can say that nearly 3 months on, I am having less random crying episodes now so I guess that's progress of sorts. I suppose I do feel ""better"" than I did in the early days too. So we will get there, but it seems to be a very slow process. 

It seems lots of women start trying to conceive again as soon as they can, which might help with healing. I personally can't yet even face the idea of trying again which certainly worries me so clearly I have more healing to do. 

I wish you much strength. Take care of yourself. ",[],,t1_d6kmwxv,False,0,[],False,"<div class=""md""><p>I&#39;m very sorry for your loss. </p>

Have you done a RPL panel? Were you supplementing progesterone and on any kind of treatment for the clotting? 

We had to do IVF because of male factor issues. The second IVF worked but I had a mc at just before 12 weeks.

 I've since done a RPL and found out I have a clotting disorder that will need to be treated with medication the whole time I'm pregnant next time.

That means they'll be able to identify which embryos are normal, hopefully saving us from any more miscarriages. 

I would strongly recommend going to a Reproductive Endocrinologist and get testing done. It might be your eggs, it might be your partners sperm, it might be some autoimmune problem, etc. You can get a lot of answers that way, and it might be something more simple than IVF.

You are spot on about my MIL. I've been with my husband for 5 years (married 2) and I still feel like she thinks of me as just her sons wife and not her daughter-in-law. I have tried to get closer to her, but I am ready to give up. I feel like she puts no effort in (unless it is harassing us to buy a freakin house). I don't get the feeling that she doesn't like me, but it is more like she just doesn't care. However she does seem to get upset when she isn't included in our life all the time. When I was wedding planning, she never showed any interest. I invited her dress shopping and she was like ""Ugh I guess"". After her shutting down several of our ideas we kind of got the feeling she didn't want to be involved, so we stopped trying. Then I find out from SIL after the wedding that she was really upset and she really wanted to help out as much as she could. 


I joke that I am ready to give up trying to have a relationship with her, but I know I could never do that. I hate not being close to family of any kind. However, I think I am also putting too much hope into thinking me giving her her first grandbaby will forge a relationship. If she continues the way she is now after we have kids, I will be heartbroken. My husband has already said he wishes I had a closer relationship with his mom before we have kids, but he isn't even that close to her.

Just chugging along and trying not to worry about anything. I think I&#39;m having sciatic nerve pain in my ass, which I had during my first pregnancy.. except this is worse. MY BUTTCHEEK HURTS!</p>

She also said everything will be better when I finally have a baby (she doesn't know I'm pregnant). Like, ok but that won't unchanged what happened or make me less angry or sad now. I'm angry that I have to worry about the anti anxiety meds I had to go on after our
 loss when other people in my family and that I know have perfect pregnancies. I'm angry everyone looks at me like they pity me and I'm glass.

DH had a sweet moment with baby yesterday :) He's felt her kick before and it seems to make him happy and excited. It's always happened when I'm relaxing and feel her kicking and call him over. Last night we were in bed about to sleep and he comes in for a cuddle and reaches for the belly. So I roll on my back to give him access. He rubs lightly and boop - little baby gives a little kick. He was so surprised! 

It threw him into a fit of giggles. Like rolling in the bed giggling like a teenaged anime girl. And every time you thought he was done, he started up again. He even teared up! He was just so tickled that he'd gone seeking baby and she'd responded. It was so cute XD

Other than that moment, yesterday sucked! Work is depressing now since I was told someone complained about my phone usage. It's made me mad at everyone... Because I don't know who it was. But I thought I was friendly with everyone and am upset someone felt the need to go tattle on me, I feel like I trust them less. And I feel like I'm back in high school, afraid to take out my phone because as soon as I do that person will probably walk by and see. I was told to take walks instead but it's over 100 F, that's not really an option.

And some day this week I have to move from my semi private desk to a crowded one. My current single cube mate keeps saying how it sucks and she's sorry (she helped facilitate my move to the good desk) and she wasn't part of the decision. I think she could tell I was mopey but I didn't even tell her about the phone thing so she thinks it's all about the desk. It does suck, I don't want her to remind me. And hearing someone else say it's not fair etc makes me more upset. I know she's just trying to commiserate, but I don't want to talk about it. I don't want to talk to anyone. I wish we didn't need insurance in this country so I could quit now.

<p>It threw him into a fit of giggles. Like rolling in the bed giggling like a teenaged anime girl. And every time you thought he was done, he started up again. He even teared up! He was just so tickled that he&#39;d gone seeking baby and she&#39;d responded. It was so cute XD</p>

<p>Other than that moment, yesterday sucked! Work is depressing now since I was told someone complained about my phone usage. It&#39;s made me mad at everyone... Because I don&#39;t know who it was. But I thought I was friendly with everyone and am upset someone felt the need to go tattle on me, I feel like I trust them less. And I feel like I&#39;m back in high school, afraid to take out my phone because as soon as I do that person will probably walk by and see. I was told to take walks instead but it&#39;s over 100 F, that&#39;s not really an option.</p>

<p>And some day this week I have to move from my semi private desk to a crowded one. My current single cube mate keeps saying how it sucks and she&#39;s sorry (she helped facilitate my move to the good desk) and she wasn&#39;t part of the decision. I think she could tell I was mopey but I didn&#39;t even tell her about the phone thing so she thinks it&#39;s all about the desk. It does suck, I don&#39;t want her to remind me. And hearing someone else say it&#39;s not fair etc makes me more upset. I know she&#39;s just trying to commiserate, but I don&#39;t want to talk about it. I don&#39;t want to talk to anyone. I wish we didn&#39;t need insurance in this country so I could quit now.</p>

<p>Anyways, scan today. Making up two missing images from the anatomy scan plus a growth scan.</p>

I always finish my work and the team managers don't have a problem with my work either. My manager wasn't really reprimanding me, just letting me know other people watch other people in these crammed pods and it could bother them. I was pretty upset though that someone cared enough about what I was doing to go tell my manager. I think I know who it was, a girl in my role on my last team. She'd take 80% of the work without giving me a chance to take it first. So how can she complain? I had nothing to do BECAUSE of her. Not she had to do more because I didn't.

It&#39;s been great, it&#39;s so quiet there! No one to annoy me. Now I have to move to a smaller desk crammed in with 5 other people. </p>

<p>And he said someone complained about me being on my phone and social media too much. I am on those a lot, but it&#39;s also because I don&#39;t usually have a lot of work to do. I always finish my work and the team managers don&#39;t have a problem with my work either. My manager wasn&#39;t really reprimanding me, just letting me know other people watch other people in these crammed pods and it could bother them. I was pretty upset though that someone cared enough about what I was doing to go tell my manager. I think I know who it was, a girl in my role on my last team. She&#39;d take 80% of the work without giving me a chance to take it first. So how can she complain? I had nothing to do BECAUSE of her. Not she had to do more because I didn&#39;t.</p>

<p>The only good part of the day was when the baby startled me lol I was slouching under my desk so my stomach by my belly button level was lightly pressed against the edge of the desk. Baby has kicked in this position before so reliably I wondered if it was actually gas. Well she found just the perfect combination of kicking at the thinnest point (least fat) with the tightest skin right next to my belly button, and right on the desk with a strong kick. I jumped and backed away from the desk lol I felt so silly, I was glad I was still at my old desk and no one saw. It was such a weird and sudden feeling, almost ticklish!</p>

<p>If a midwife doesn&#39;t work out, have you considered a doula instead?  Far more affordable, and studies have shown having a doula can shorten labor, decrease cesarean rate by 50%, decrease epidural use by 60% and decrease induction by pitocin by 40%.  Something you could consider.</p>

Definitely not an advanced scientist, but I have the background to be able to interpret some. 

So, anything with ""ploidy"" refers to chromosomes. So the egg and sperm are haploid (single set of chromosomes) and come together to form a fertilized egg with a full diploid (2 sets) of chromosomes. In some cases there can be an egg or sperm where the chromosomes failed to separate during meiosis (how they are formed), in which case they are triploid (have three sets). This was ruled out. The trickier ones are aneuploidy or structural chromosomal abnormalities. These can be inherited from an egg or sperm or can arise in the fertilized egg during the first divisions (mitosis) as the embryo forms. Aneuploidy (an = not, eu=good true, ploidy=chromosomes -- so literally, not good chromosomes) refers to the wrong number of chromosomes (e.g., not 46). These results show that they looked from trisomy 18 (an extra copy of chromosome #18), which is the most common trisomy, but that it was not there. It does not rule out extra copies of other chromosomes (except the sex determining ones, which were good too), which are possible, but more unlikely. It also did not rule out structural problems with chromosomes. It's sort of crazy, but chromosomes can actually swap segments during meiosis (egg/sperm formation) and sometimes the swap is not even, in which case there can be extra or missing information in the egg and sperm that carry on. The final set of chromosomes are sex determining. Just like the others, there should be two (there were), and the absence of the Y chromosome (which determines maleness) indicates it was female. 

Don't worry about asking these questions of your doctor, this is complicated stuff. Even with my background, I have found the amount of technical language I have encountered during this process to be overwhelming at times. Good questions reflect a thinking person, no shame there.

Definitely not an advanced scientist, but I have the background to be able to interpret some. </p>

<p>So, anything with &quot;ploidy&quot; refers to chromosomes. So the egg and sperm are haploid (single set of chromosomes) and come together to form a fertilized egg with a full diploid (2 sets) of chromosomes. In some cases there can be an egg or sperm where the chromosomes failed to separate during meiosis (how they are formed), in which case they are triploid (have three sets). This was ruled out. The trickier ones are aneuploidy or structural chromosomal abnormalities. These can be inherited from an egg or sperm or can arise in the fertilized egg during the first divisions (mitosis) as the embryo forms. Aneuploidy (an = not, eu=good true, ploidy=chromosomes -- so literally, not good chromosomes) refers to the wrong number of chromosomes (e.g., not 46). These results show that they looked from trisomy 18 (an extra copy of chromosome #18), which is the most common trisomy, but that it was not there. It does not rule out extra copies of other chromosomes (except the sex determining ones, which were good too), which are possible, but more unlikely. It also did not rule out structural problems with chromosomes.

<p>I take them twice a day so last night I took the new medicine instead of the old and had a bad night. I&#39;ve had worse, I actually slept. But every time I woke up to pee, my body felt extra heavy and difficult to move. And I laid back down and it took me a while to be able to breathe. Woke up feeling just terrible, not breathing well, heart thudding, hard to move, sore upper back. Just overall not good. I felt like I hardly had the strength to scratch my dog. I usually give him a vigorous face scratch but I just weakly pet him and then cried because he and my husband were all up on me.</p>

<p>I just don&#39;t know what to think anymore. Why I feel like this. Is it from stopping pills? Starting new pills? Anxiety? Just being pregnant? Something else is going on? I don&#39;t know what to tell my doctors, they tell me this can happen in pregnancy when I&#39;ve tried. So maybe I&#39;m just being a wuss, but I can&#39;t imagine other pregnant people being ok with this. I don&#39;t even have a big bump, I&#39;m scared of how I&#39;ll feel later on.</p>

Temps keep rising! Go, body, go!

In other news: I have (not even recently) suddenly become allergic to my wedding band and it's really bumming me out. I *love* my wedding band. My husband got it designed custom for me and it means a lot to me, but I just can't wear it anymore. I feel like a weird naked liar with no rings on. I've resorted to wearing my much too large engagement ring in its stead (which I'm also allergic to, but less so), just so I have *something* on my finger. I'm going to look into getting a duplicate of my wedding band made out of titanium. It's very simple; wide band with 2 stones set in it, one atop the other. So yeah, gotta send some emails about that.

Make sure you take the time to grieve...feel what you feel at that moment. Do not think you need to be ""over it"" in any set timeframe. In fact you'll likely never be ""over it"" - you will move forward, you will improve, you will feel better. But right now you are hurting and that's normal and understandable.

I had a D&C and then chose to wait. After my 2nd D&C we were not waiting...and I got pregnant that cycle, but it was a chemical pregnancy. My doctors think that was a progesterone issue, my own issue -- not because I had just had surgery. Unless something has gone wrong/there are any complications, the only true reason to wait is dating. When you are past your 14 days waiting (for surgery), I'd say to do as you want and let it happen, like you say. :)  The ONLY thing there is to be sure you're in an ok emotional place. We waited after my first loss and I NEEDED to...after my 2nd, I didn't feel the need to wait. But if I'd gotten pregnant quickly after my 1st loss...and then lost again...I believe I'd have been inconsolable. That's me, very personal. But a good thing to think about -- the emotional readiness to go through a pregnancy after loss. Pregnancy after loss is a special kind of hell, as you worry a lot more.  If you think you're ready, go for it!! :)

Thinking of you!

Last night I came home from PT and was a mess. I was crying at PT and then every single tiny movement of my leg made me writhe in pain.

I ran out of episodes of the random show I started last week....so Netflix suggested one and I ran with it...

In the FIRST episode there was a young couple whose baby girl had died 4 days after birth due to a heart condition...and they were divorcing due to not dealing with the grief well in their marriage. I bawled my eyes out...I was a mess. But it was a good show and...sometimes crying is cathartic...so I watched more.

In another episode we learn that this woman's 25 year old daughter was a twin...and her twin brother died at age 13 So - I bawled. And I'm worried to keep watching. Sigh. I was already so emotionally and physically drained and then BAM.

THEN (and this is a **Stranger Things SPOILER**) -- in the Stranger Things episode we were on, they talked about late term miscarriage. Rawr.

I think I should swear off TV. hah

<p>I broke down and did the calendar math to find out that today is CD24 (can&#39;t believe I made it that long without charting!). I hope that my cycle shortens this time around (39 days last cycle), and that I can either see pregnancy results or a period sooner rather than later.</p>

<p>Husband is out of town on a work trip for the next week, so this next week is going to go slow unfortunately. Yesterday I was feeling tired and had to pee  a million times, so of course I thought &quot;pregnant!&quot; but it was much more likely &quot;drinking a lot of water.&quot; </p>

<p>To distract myself, I started re-reading the Harry Potter books and have really been enjoying myself! Already onto The Chamber of Secrets :)</p>

<p>Oh, and just logged on to work and saw a pregnancy announcement in my email. Fun way to start the morning. </p>

Welcome to a club you never wanted to join, but that is fantastic. 

No matter how ""easy"" or ""short"" your journey to pregnancy has been so far, you experienced a loss...and that's tough. SO tough. Looking at the brighter side and remembering all of the good things in your life is a great thing to do -- important to keep your spirits up as much as possible. But you're entitled to some self pity and sad feelings -- you lost your pregnancy/your baby and all of the things that come with that. You are grieving and should not be expected to always ""count your blessings"". I truly hope nobody has told you that. I'd want to smack them. :) 

A common theme in here is about all the people we know who get pregnant easily and have perfect, healthy pregnancies. It's tough to watch, from our side of things. Seems like most of us have felt that at some point. I even have a BFF who never wanted kids until like a year ago, went off BC, and got pregnant on 2nd cycle -- SO hard to watch and try to care/be happy. Don't feel bad about any inability to be happy for others.....and most of the time we ARE happy, but it makes us sad for us. That's fine!! Don't feel guilty about that. Well, try not to. :)

I hate the TWW - its definitely anxiety inducing sometimes. You're not alone there, either. hah I hope this one goes smoothly for you and that soon you have what you want -- a healthy pregnancy and a baby.

Again, welcome. I hope you find this sub to be helpful - I know I sure have.

Yesterday was the first time I've called my dr about something concerning. I was having some pretty annoying dull back pain which isn't too unusual, but i also felt like i peed my pants. i went to the bathroom and had a bunch of discharge that got all over my pants (more egg white mucus than anything), but didn't appear to be steadily leaking. I called in and they asked me a series of questions and said they weren't too concerned, but to keep an eye on everything. They said the back pain sounded like RLP due to her switching positions and i took some tylenol and laid down and it was much better. She was very active yesterday, so I didn't think too much into it and I never came remotely close to filling a pad so everything seemed okay. 

Now today, i'm sitting at my desk and i've had a constant feeling like i'm slowly peeing my pants with no pain at all. There's no egg white discharge today and i have a panty liner on that doesn't appear to be soaked, but i literally just feel like i'm sitting here leaking. Baby girl wasn't moving too much this morning, so i just drank some pop and now she's jumping around in there, so she appears to be okay. 

So i guess my question is, should i be this concerned? I have no hesitation calling my doctor every day for the remainder of my pregnancy just to be safe (and they assured me that they would rather me call than not. they're so awesome), but I'm trying not to be a crazy person. They gave me some tips to help asses the situation (timing, pain levels, smell, appearance etc) and all seem to be normal for what they're telling me, but i would hate to underestimate a situation.

I was still battling those feelings of ""I shouldn't be going, I should be pregnant"" etc, but I was feeling as close to OK as I had been since the MC.

Because my last quant was over 30 days old?? Anyway by the end of the day the doctor recommended that I not go and I feel like that much weight was lifted off my chest. Even the anger I was carrying around is less. The only worry I have is dealing with my leadership when they find out. They won't be happy.

My sibling has the same allele, and I&#39;ve developed the exact same 1st metatarsal pain that they&#39;ve had for years. So I&#39;m like... Great. Now I have a stupid toe that will probably never stop hurting, and a wrist that&#39;s been hurting for months, and other persistent aches and pains that I&#39;m now very curious about. Fucking yay. </p>

<p>4dpo, I think, and feeling cautiously optimistic. But also cautiously pessimistic? I guess the word of the day is ambivalent. </p>

<p>Also have a twat wanting tomorrow morning. Get ready, bladder. </p>

Yesterday at work during a meeting, one of the managers used the phrase ""babies are dying"" to describe an urgent situation for a client. She repeated herself a few times because I guess she thought she was being funny. I didn't. Afterwards my friend commented on it, saying that could be offensive to someone and what a weird choice of words. Friend doesn't know about my loss.

I typed up an email to my manager to let him know and ask him to talk to her, but I never sent it. By the time I figured out how to word everything, it didn't seem like something I needed to run to my manager about anymore, although this was the second meeting I've heard her say it in. I just felt like the whiny employee who complains about everything being offensive and they'll think, oh she's probably just upset because she's pregnant (manager doesn't know about loss)

And I can no longer figure out if I'm feeling anxiety or something else. At any rate these BP pills seem to have made the anxiety worse. Last night i got shakey and it got harder to breathe, my bra felt tight and I had pressure at the top of my stomach, and my heart rate went up. Written out it sounds like anxiety, but it came on very suddenly and out of nowhere. It was hard to recognize as such, if that's what it was.

I've been having an issue with breathing, especially in bed. But it's always felt like hard to take a full breath. Now I'm waking up feeling like the amount of air is fine, but that it's not doing anything for me. Like I'm not getting enough oxygen from the air I'm breathing.

The issue I had before I could excuse as my uterus pushing on my organs, but this problem idk.

My wife doesn't really come on Reddit and I'm just a long-term lurker on different subs but I felt compelled to share the news we got today.  

A little backstory, my wife and I have been married 1.5 years (both recently turned 32 as well.)  After waiting roughly a year we started TTC last December and much to our surprise we found out my wife was pregnant in early February after going off BC in early November.  We were shocked yet very excited and for the next two months everything proceeded as normal.  Unfortunately we discovered she had a missed MC in early April around 12 weeks during the ultrasound scan.  Needless to say that was absolutely gutting for the both of us.  I was surprised how crushed I was, you know two months of planning for this next phase of your lives then silence in the ultrasound... but it has honestly brought us closer together than ever. I sought out information immediately afterwards and learned so much that I literally had NO idea about when it comes to TTC...thanks to this sub and others!  After her D&C we waited for her first cycle to actively try again.  

She is on her third cycle right now (13 DPO) and was going to wait until tomorrow to test (AF due) but for some reason I had a gut feeling she should just go ahead and test after work.  We started testing much earlier than that last cycle and both decided that's not for us lol.  Lo and behold after using a Wondfo we looked and I said ""Holy crap it's a squinter"" (but actually darker than that) and she said I've been reading reddit too much (like I said, she's right) but she also know these aren't like the OPKs so she immediately dug out the Clear Blue Digital.  I left the bathroom for a minute and heard ""HOLY SHIT!""  After using the second one which quickly confirmed the same ""PREGNANT"" reading it sunk in for her (I was already convinced by those Amazon Wondfos *pats back.)  We're thrilled and thinking positive right now but will be very hesitant to share news until we can see her OBGYN.  He's a great doc and told us after the D&C that he'd get us right in when we got a positive for blood work so at least we won't have to wait too long to confirm.  

Thanks to this sub for the ideas of PreSeed and SMEP!  We started using Preseed on her second cycle and just tried SMEP on the current one.  It worked well for us and I had no complaints ;).  Very thankful for this day and it's great feeling.  Hope you guys don't mind me positing this on here but I had to share this news with someone haha!  Best of luck to all of you!








TL;DR: Husband here. Both 32. MMC w/ D&C April 2016 @ 12 weeks.  3 months trying again BFP today on Wondfo and 2 Clear Digitals.  Proud future daddy.

(13+0) Unfortunately our scan today gave us bad news. Baby has a thickened nuchal translucency (4.3) as well as a cystic hygroma. These two things together mean about a 2/3 risk of chromosomal abnormality. We are going for a CVS tomorrow morning and should have initial results from that Friday or Monday to find out if it's trisomy 21 (Down's) trisomy 18, trisomy 13 or a sex chromosome issue like turners. If that comes back negative, we will wait for the more in depth results in a couple of weeks, and we will start testing for other genetic issues. The genetic counselor was wonderful and very realistic. She seemed to think that a chromosomal abnormality is the most likely outcome given everything. 

The cystic hygroma means a high chance of hydrops or of heart and skeletal defects as the baby grows even without a chromosomal abnormality. Our chances of a normal, healthy baby at this point are unfortunately very low. 

We are absolutely devastated but just holding on until we have more information. It's been a really tough day. I'm so tired of being on the losing end of all of the statistics.

I would encourage you to try to be patient with yourself, and allow healing to take the course it needs to, which is not easy to predict. I inflicted quite a lot of psychological damage on myself by not doing this. 

My first loss I had a D&C, the procedure itself went fine, but I was a very rare instance where not all of the POC were removed and had months of intense pain and bleeding (statistically you can bet on this not happening to you). I could have gone back for a second D&C, but it was quite expensive, even with insurance coverage (and I'm stubborn, at that point I felt like I needed to do it myself). Needless to say, this threw a wrench in my efforts to TTC again. The complications also meant that my body was just not ready to conceive again for quite a while. I spiraled into depression because I set up this goal of conceiving again when I was physically and mentally not ready. I think I would have been a lot better off focusing on being kind and patient with myself, instead I felt an ever increasing sense of disappointment. Eventually I started seeing a therapist, built a regular exercise (yoga) practice, and went to an RE to alleviate fears about scarring from retained tissue.

They are in a new office and while I was waiting, I could hear everything being said. There was a complication, but they said they had faith in a good outcome. It was like hearing myself last time around. Then they checked the babies heartbeat and I could hear that too - totally panic inducing. I scrambled for my headphones and listened to music until it was my turn. 

My midwife (a guy!) is great however and very supportive. If we get so far, they even have a spare doppler to lend out to nervous pregnant women after 14 weeks! So thoughtful. I can get an early ultrasound, which will be around 8 weeks because the hospital doesn't have time earlier. I will be under the care of my gynaecologist for the 10 week and 12 week u/s and NIPT. All that is great and I am truly greatful for the great care. I did mention the waiting room experience and they are going to check if they can play some music in the waiting room. 

I was still shaking from the waiting, so I am hoping that was it, but my BP was through the roof. I have to come back next week to check again. Last pregnancy it was perfect.

They are in a new office and while I was waiting, I could hear everything being said. There was a complication, but they said they had faith in a good outcome. It was like hearing myself last time around. Then they checked the babies heartbeat and I could hear that too - totally panic inducing. I scrambled for my headphones and listened to music until it was my turn. </p>

<p>My midwife (a guy!) is great however and very supportive. If we get so far, they even have a spare doppler to lend out to nervous pregnant women after 14 weeks! So thoughtful. I can get an early ultrasound, which will be around 8 weeks because the hospital doesn&#39;t have time earlier. I will be under the care of my gynaecologist for the 10 week and 12 week <a href=""/u/s"">u/s</a> and NIPT. All that is great and I am truly greatful for the great care.

My advice is advocate hard for yourself with regards to medical care.  Demand an ultrasound after the procedure to make sure the tissue is gone. If your doc won&#39;t do it, fire them and find a new doctor.  I can understand your desire to move forward.  My heart is just aching for you right now.

I've had 2 miscarriages. Both ended up happening naturally so I don't know if I can provide much insight on D&C, etc. However, I thought I would share what I could. The first was super early (really more of chemical pregnancy) and just kind of happened (same as getting a period). 

The second one didn't happen so fast on it's own. I found it was not viable but had barely had any bleeding. My OB wasn't very concerned and told me to just wait a couple weeks. I kind of freaked out because, like you, I just wanted it to be over and done with ASAP. About a week later I was about to see a different doctor for a second opinion about whether I should have a D&C, but the miscarriage happened naturally before I went in. In hindsight, as awful as that week was, I'm glad I didn't have the D&C right away as I think the recovery time would have been longer. However, I think there's also some risk of infection if you wait too long for things to happen on their own (and I have heard of it taking forever), so I would see what your doctor says. 

For natural early-ish miscarriages, there isn't really a need to wait more than a cycle or so to try again unless you have some other health concerns. My first period after my second mc was really kind of bizarre (timing, length, consistency, all just very off) so waiting a month is probably a good idea. But they used to tell women to wait 3 to 6 months and some doctors still do. It's not based on any real research, it just became the standard practice decades ago and has kind of stuck around. If someone tells you wait to that long (and it's not a molar pregnancy or there isn't another issue), you could feel okay about doing some research or getting a second opinion about whether that's right. I think the wait time for D&C might be a little longer to make sure things heal, I'm really not sure. But again if you need a D&C, I don't think recovery time is a good reason to not have one. The blood levels Wednesday may tell you something. If hcg is dropping enough, letting things happen naturally may be fine. If it's not dropping and the pregnancy isn't viable, D&C may be the way to go. 

My doctor gave me some different things to try after the second miscarriage (baby aspirin, different vitamins) and I think that helped me feel like I was doing something which was good (even though none of it has worked yet). 

Finally, take some time to take care of yourself even if you are TTC again right away. My miscarriages were so close together. After the second one I just kind of threw myself into trying again assuming I could get pregnant again right away. Then about 4 or 5 months later when I wasn't pregnant again, it kind of all crashed down on me and I got super depressed. I think it would have been better if I had tried to process, grieve, and accept it a little more even while ttc again.

17w today and had a really big scare this afternoon after lunch.. I went to the bathroom and noticed my underwear having a wet spot. It was clear, no scent but still it freaked me out big time. Thought I'd was amniotic fluid and called the midwives office and we could come in right away thank god.

It wasn't amniotic fluid thank god. The midwife couldn't say for 100% it wasn't, because they just can't. Baby's heartbeat sounded excellent. She said it probably was normal discharge, but around the term I'm in the discharge will change to be more watery, which probably caused the wet stain. 
Got home and took a shower at the midwife's request and put on clean underwear. I have to keep an eye on that and the coming night I have to sleep without so I can check the bedding in the morning. If it were to be amniotic fluid I should feel it dripping down also, which I thankfully don't.

I have my post 20w anatomy ultrasound OB appt today. I suddenly have a worry she'll say something negative about the ultrasound even though the tech at the hospital seemed to act like everything was fine and congratulated us when we left (I feel like if something was wrong, she wouldn't have done that).  Everything I saw looked fine (4 chamber heart, 3V cord, two arms, two legs, moving... Haha).

I'm also really worried about what she'll say about my weight gain. Since 16w (last appt) I have just blown up. I'm concerned and I'm hoping I get to bring it up first. The idea of being reprimanded for my weight is... Well it'll mess up my mental state for sure. :(

Edit: well I'm back. After waiting in the waiting room for 45mins (that's what happens when you go for the independent doc instead of the ""group"" ones--where you get whoever is on call for your labor), I tell the nurse as I'm stepping on the scale that I've gained a lot and I know: it's my first question for the doc. And she's like ""yeah, wow, 12lbs since we saw you last"" (5 weeks ago). And so I'm like... Trying not to cry as she goes on ""well sometimes you get one big jump then it levels off. Hopefully it's just one! You don't want to look like me!"" She also said ""You look just fine so yeah, ask doc.""

So I'm doing breathing exercises to stave off the panic. (For those who haven't seen my recent rants: I'm a recovering anorexic, though it seems so hilarious to give myself that description with my current size.) 

Doc comes in, her verdict is this: baby is BIG, as in measuring more like 24weeks than 21weeks right now. I ate like crap on holiday, probably too much salt/it's hot out. But it's not all my fault, and to just eat healthier like I have been now..... though she said the 2200-2300cals a day I have been doing this past few days (since I started tracking) isn't enough. Does that seem right to you?! She said 3000 calories! What?! I am near sedentary with my leg pain, so I think that makes a difference...

I don't know. Part of me thinks she's outdated on the calorie info, but another part of me is scared that's the ED sneaking in. I am pretty sure I read 2200-2300 online...

<p>So I&#39;m doing breathing exercises to stave off the panic. (For those who haven&#39;t seen my recent rants: I&#39;m a recovering anorexic, though it seems so hilarious to give myself that description with my current size.) </p>

<p>Doc comes in, her verdict is this: baby is BIG, as in measuring more like 24weeks than 21weeks right now. I ate like crap on holiday, probably too much salt/it&#39;s hot out. But it&#39;s not all my fault, and to just eat healthier like I have been now..... though she said the 2200-2300cals a day I have been doing this past few days (since I started tracking) isn&#39;t enough. Does that seem right to you?! She said 3000 calories! What?! I am near sedentary with my leg pain, so I think that makes a difference...</p>

<p>I don&#39;t know. Part of me thinks she&#39;s outdated on the calorie info, but another part of me is scared that&#39;s the ED sneaking in. I am pretty sure I read 2200-2300 online... What did your doc say?</p>

Didn't feel like cramps though and after a while I realized this was just the gas/irritation from my upset stomach. Still fucked with my head.

I can't lose this one because there is no trying again. I just can't mentally and emotionally deal with that.

Went out of town on a Ikea trip yesterday! I love Ikea. We found a lot of things to get for baby and other parts of our house, but didn't buy anything yet. Craziest coincidence happened, we bumped into my friend who had a surprise baby after finding out she was pregnant at like 32+ weeks!! She was out with her tiny little one week old who was born at 35 weeks. Wouldnt have been my choice of a ""I just need to get out"" outing... But it was nice to see the baby. He was soooo small. I was too scared to hold him as we were standing and the floor was concrete and he's so small and... Nope. Would have loved to if it had been at her house!

Later in the evening I settled down on the couch to try and feel baby who hadn't moved all day, which is becoming normal. 8:00 turned to 9 turned to 10 and I started getting nervous. Finally felt her around 10, the little troll.

I felt my heart was pounding and just a little fast and I assumed it was anxiety about not feeling her yet. But it didn't go away even when i did, and I was relaxed. It didn't go away when I went to bed. It just didn't go away, which then did give me anxiety again yes. I don't know if this is a reaction to my BP meds, although I didn't find it mentioned online. Or is this just being pregnant?! Or is my anxiety more out of control than I thought? I tried all I could to feel calm and couldn't fix it. Maybe it'd slow a bit, but the slightest movement would increase it again.

<p>Went out of town on a Ikea trip yesterday! I love Ikea. We found a lot of things to get for baby and other parts of our house, but didn&#39;t buy anything yet. Craziest coincidence happened, we bumped into my friend who had a surprise baby after finding out she was pregnant at like 32+ weeks!! She was out with her tiny little one week old who was born at 35 weeks. Wouldnt have been my choice of a &quot;I just need to get out&quot; outing... But it was nice to see the baby. He was soooo small. I was too scared to hold him as we were standing and the floor was concrete and he&#39;s so small and... Nope. Would have loved to if it had been at her house!</p>

<p>Later in the evening I settled down on the couch to try and feel baby who hadn&#39;t moved all day, which is becoming normal. 8:00 turned to 9 turned to 10 and I started getting nervous. Finally felt her around 10, the little troll.</p>

<p>I felt my heart was pounding and just a little fast and I assumed it was anxiety about not feeling her yet. But it didn&#39;t go away even when i did, and I was relaxed. It didn&#39;t go away when I went to bed. It just didn&#39;t go away, which then did give me anxiety again yes. I don&#39;t know if this is a reaction to my BP meds, although I didn&#39;t find it mentioned online. Or is this just being pregnant?! Or is my anxiety more out of control than I thought? I tried all I could to feel calm and couldn&#39;t fix it. Maybe it&#39;d slow a bit, but the slightest movement would increase it again.</p>

I was soooo sick the past two weeks with this awful cold/flu/cough/plague thing which left me a snotty, coughing, exhausted mess. As of yesterday I finally feel like a human being again. A few weeks ago I was feeling full and super-pregnant but this weekend felt like midway through the second trimester. I had lots of energy, felt light on my feet, and there were moments I forgot I was pregnant. My back didn't even bother me. The fatigue is bound to creep back again anytime soon and my back will undoubtedly play up again so I'll enjoy this feeling while it lasts.

This weekend we came up with a plan for how to fit the new baby in the house. It will require moving a few things around, getting rid of other things, putting some things into storage, and building a shelf. Things will be tight but we'll manage.

My sister law offered us her Ergo 360 carrier which will be really handy. We live near the city so we walk nearly everywhere. If we walk more than about a kilometre we have to put my son in the pram. I'm not keen on buying a double pram so until my son can walk longer distances we'll wear the baby. The baby Bjorn is great for newborns (so we'll use that at first) but after 2-3 months it hurt my back. I've heard the Ergo works for older kids. Our neighbours also have a Manduca (?) their youngest daughter has nearly grown out of and they have offered it to us, so we are spoiled for choice with carriers.

(TW: mention of living child) My son is so excited about his baby sister! Yesterday he said he wanted her to come out now. We keep telling him she needs to grow some more before she's ready to come out. The Ovia app has a little handprint with a smaller handprint inside which shows how big the baby's hand is compared to how big it will be when she is born. It's a ""handy"" visual aide for my son. So now he knows when the little handprint is the same as the big handprint then his sister will be ready to come out.

Also, I've mentioned before how much I love my neighbourhood and today reinforced that yet again. Our neighbours from around the corner dropped by unannounced with their 3.5 and 1 year old girls, and a few minutes later the 3.5 year old girl and 8 year old boy from down the street came over while their mum went grocery shopping. So we had 5 kids in our tiny little house running up and down the stairs, climbing in and out of our son's bed, pulling all his toys out, and generally causing havoc. It was delightful to have a chaotic, impromptu play date. This doesn't happen as often during winter, but during summer our kids just wander into each other's houses and then we send them home when they're done playing. Half the toys at our place belong to the neighbour kids and many of our toys are out on loan. We live in a city of millions of people, but our neighbourhood is a close-knit little village. We will outgrow our house soon, but we want to stay here as long as possible.

Back to work tomorrow. Hope you all have a great week!",[],,t1_d67nw06,False,0,[],False,"<div class=""md""><p>28+5 today and I&#39;m feeling great!

[TW: a very sad metaphor about miscarriage from The Little Prince]

I watched _The Little Prince_ yesterday. I had liked that book when I was little but hadn't memorized every moment or anything. Somehow I forgot about the part when the prince is explaining to the pilot why he has to leave the world, but without his body:

""And he took me by the hand. But he was still worrying.

""It was wrong of you to come. You will suffer. I shall look as if I were dead; and that will not be true . . .""

I said nothing.

""You understand . . . it is too far. I cannot carry this body with me. It is too heavy.""

I said nothing.

""But it will be like an old abandoned shell. There is nothing sad about old shells . . .""

I said nothing.""

It really hit me when the movie recreated this moment, almost word for word. I thought about my baby and how a gestational sac is like a shell. And for the first time, I _really really_ focused on the love and hope my husband and I generated and how _that_ hasn't died and that's why we've both been wandering around with so much grief and hope stirred up in us. The prince tells the pilot to look at the stars and think of him and somehow that brought me a lot of comfort yesterday. That I could fix my vision on something and allow myself to think about the love and memory and not just focus on the anger and loss and impatience to feel full with pregnancy again.

Today I&#39;m not feeling as emotionally keyed up, but I woke up with an intensely bad headache and just feeling like I had a hangover even though I&#39;m not drinking or anything. Somehow in a decent mood despite of the feeling. I&#39;ve been thinking about something I watched yesterday.</p>

<p>[TW: a very sad metaphor about miscarriage from The Little Prince]</p>

<p>I watched <em>The Little Prince</em> yesterday. I had liked that book when I was little but hadn&#39;t memorized every moment or anything. Somehow I forgot about the part when the prince is explaining to the pilot why he has to leave the world, but without his body:</p>

<p>&quot;And he took me by the hand. But he was still worrying.</p>

<p>&quot;It was wrong of you to come. You will suffer. I shall look as if I were dead; and that will not be true . . .&quot;</p>

<p>I said nothing.</p>

<p>&quot;You understand . . . it is too far. I cannot carry this body with me. It is too heavy.&quot;</p>

<p>I said nothing.</p>

<p>&quot;But it will be like an old abandoned shell. There is nothing sad about old shells . . .&quot;</p>

<p>I said nothing.&quot;</p>

<p>It really hit me when the movie recreated this moment, almost word for word. I thought about my baby and how a gestational sac is like a shell. And for the first time, I <em>really really</em> focused on the love and hope my husband and I generated and how <em>that</em> hasn&#39;t died and that&#39;s why we&#39;ve both been wandering around with so much grief and hope stirred up in us. The prince tells the pilot to look at the stars and think of him and somehow that brought me a lot of comfort yesterday. That I could fix my vision on something and allow myself to think about the love and memory and not just focus on the anger and loss and impatience to feel full with pregnancy again. </p>

<p>Hang in there everyone! &lt;3</p>

Husband is not giving in to my pee stick demands until tomorrow.   I even offered back scratches and seduction and he didn't give in.  Good for him.

&nbsp;

My thought/rambling for the day and I know it's a common complaint around here, so sorry for the repetitiveness.  My MIL is very sweet, I honestly love her to pieces.  A card arrived in the mail yesterday from her and it was a very sweet ""just thinking of you card"".  But in the card she wrote something about how I just need to be patient and how God's timing is perfect and He has a plan for me, etc.

&nbsp;

Sigh.  It's very nice and I know she means well and she is pretty religious.  I am also religious, though the husband and I have kind of fallen out of going to church.  Mostly because my work schedule and the fact that we can't find one close to us that we both like enough.  Anyway, it just kinda bothered me and it makes me feel ... Looked down upon?  First of all, I don't believe that God ""plans"" for me to have a miscarriage.  And if He does, well that's not the kind of God I want to be involved with anyway.  If anything, me getting pregnant had re-energized my husband and I's search for a new church.  The miscarriage stopped that search in its tracks.  So, not really a smart plan on God's part if that's the case.   I only believe that God can make good out of bad, not that he makes bad happen so people can learn lessons or whatever.  I say horseshit.  

&nbsp;

And ugh just the telling me to be patient.  Unless she found my Reddit account, she should have no idea how patient I am or not.  And I don't want to be patient.  I'm tired of being patient.  I've wanted a baby for years and it took me a long time to get my husband on board.   Then I finally get pregnant and the baby dies when I'm almost 11 weeks?  Screw being patient.  I have no choice in the matter.  Whether it happens has nothing to do with me being patient.  

&nbsp;

Sorry for this long rant.  Maybe it's my progesterone talking.

",[],,t1_d66p6fd,False,0,[],False,"<div class=""md""><p>9 dpo.   Husband is not giving in to my pee stick demands until tomorrow.   I even offered back scratches and seduction and he didn&#39;t give in.  Good for him.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>My thought/rambling for the day and I know it&#39;s a common complaint around here, so sorry for the repetitiveness.  My MIL is very sweet, I honestly love her to pieces.  A card arrived in the mail yesterday from her and it was a very sweet &quot;just thinking of you card&quot;.  But in the card she wrote something about how I just need to be patient and how God&#39;s timing is perfect and He has a plan for me, etc.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Sigh.  It&#39;s very nice and I know she means well and she is pretty religious.  I am also religious, though the husband and I have kind of fallen out of going to church.  Mostly because my work schedule and the fact that we can&#39;t find one close to us that we both like enough.  Anyway, it just kinda bothered me and it makes me feel ... Looked down upon?  First of all, I don&#39;t believe that God &quot;plans&quot; for me to have a miscarriage.  And if He does, well that&#39;s not the kind of God I want to be involved with anyway.  If anything, me getting pregnant had re-energized my husband and I&#39;s search for a new church.  The miscarriage stopped that search in its tracks.  So, not really a smart plan on God&#39;s part if that&#39;s the case.   I only believe that God can make good out of bad, not that he makes bad happen so people can learn lessons or whatever.  I say horseshit.  </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>And ugh just the telling me to be patient.  Unless she found my Reddit account, she should have no idea how patient I am or not.  And I don&#39;t want to be patient.  I&#39;m tired of being patient.  I&#39;ve wanted a baby for years and it took me a long time to get my husband on board.   Then I finally get pregnant and the baby dies when I&#39;m almost 11 weeks?  Screw being patient.  I have no choice in the matter.  Whether it happens has nothing to do with me being patient.  </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Sorry for this long rant.  Maybe it&#39;s my progesterone talking.  Maybe it&#39;s because my job I was going to turn down came back with more money and less hours so now I have the stress of maybe changing jobs coming soon.     And I could really use some wine but have to wait until AF shows.   That&#39;s all.  Thanks for those who actually somehow made it through all this haha.  </p>

Any insight or is this one of those things I'll never know without testing for it?
