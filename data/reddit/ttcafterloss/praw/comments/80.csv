As for the procedure itself, you sit in stirrups & start with a speculum as the tiny catheter is fed into your cervix after it's swabbed with betadine.

It is so heartbreaking, unfair, and just sad. Sometimes this process am be totally shit. 

I had a d+c a little over 4 weeks ago. The dr did a scan beforehand, and showed me what should be happening, and what wasn’t happening. She was very kind. They gave me 2 drugs - 1 for pain and 1 for relaxation - though every dr is different. It was about a ten minute procedure, and there were moments of pain, but it was manageable with some deep breaths and squeezing the life out of Mr. Sparkles’ hand. I had minimal cramps for the rest of the day, and very light bleeding for about 4 days. 

I felt well enough to do a light yoga class the next day, and every day that week felt better - I didn’t even need the pain meds they sent me home with. 

Emotionally, I felt so much better after the procedure. I knew my baby was not viable, and it gave me a real sense of closure. I didn’t know how I would feel after the procedure, but after having one, I know that it I ever am in this position again, I would pick the d+c again, hands down. 

The last few weeks have been hard - my pregnancy symptoms went away in about 48 hours, but I was so worried about my cycle not going back to normal bc it took me so long to regulate after coming off birth control. So far, my cycle is right on track. I usually ovulate cd 25-31 and I got positive ovulation tests on cd 29/30. Now I’m just waiting for my temp to rise to confirm, and had a nice rise this morning. 

My biggest fear was that my cycle would go haywire and I’d never be able to pin it down, but so far, it seems to be going back to normal, although I did have intense ovulation pain, which I’ve never had before. 

Sorry for the essay, I just remember before my procedure getting a detailed analysis of what happened/how the person felt, and it gave me a lot of peace.

Sometimes this process am be totally shit. </p>

<p>I had a d+c a little over 4 weeks ago. The dr did a scan beforehand, and showed me what should be happening, and what wasn’t happening. She was very kind. They gave me 2 drugs - 1 for pain and 1 for relaxation - though every dr is different. It was about a ten minute procedure, and there were moments of pain, but it was manageable with some deep breaths and squeezing the life out of Mr. Sparkles’ hand. I had minimal cramps for the rest of the day, and very light bleeding for about 4 days. </p>

<p>I felt well enough to do a light yoga class the next day, and every day that week felt better - I didn’t even need the pain meds they sent me home with. </p>

<p>Emotionally, I felt so much better after the procedure. I knew my baby was not viable, and it gave me a real sense of closure. I didn’t know how I would feel after the procedure, but after having one, I know that it I ever am in this position again, I would pick the d+c again, hands down. </p>

<p>The last few weeks have been hard - my pregnancy symptoms went away in about 48 hours, but I was so worried about my cycle not going back to normal bc it took me so long to regulate after coming off birth control. So far, my cycle is right on track. I usually ovulate cd 25-31 and I got positive ovulation tests on cd 29/30. Now I’m just waiting for my temp to rise to confirm, and had a nice rise this morning. </p>

I had 5 losses...and my best advice is not to try to PLAN around anything. As you unfortunately know, plans about pregnancy can go to shit, even if you've already conceived. I tried to plan around scuba vacations and weddings and all that jazz...but all I really wanted was a baby.  PLUS, if you put off trying and then it doesn't work out, those periods you were planning around become really hard. 

Personally, I wouldn't wait to try. If you conceive, you'll figure it out. He may miss the birth, but he'd be happy for the LIFE. You may have to move with a tiny newborn - tons of people (especially military families!) have done this. You might be separated for a bit right before or after. This will all be hard, but WORTH it. I don't normally advocate for being alone/with less support with labor and a newborn, but sometimes it just happens -- it sounds like if your baby had lived, your husband wouldn't have been there for that birth, either. With your parents nearish, that helps, too. 

Basically, we all only have an ILLUSION of control...so waiting to try only pushes your time and chances further out.

I was worried about Asherman's after my periods got significantly lighter too. 

I had to TFMR with my first pregnancy in April 2015 (at the end of the first trimester). The procedure wound up being more complicated than anticipated because it was a twin pregnancy. My periods did not change all that much after that. >!We started TTC again in June 2015 and got a positive in December 2015.!<

>!After delivering my LC in September 2016, the placenta didn't deliver and then shredded apart during the manual removal attempt.!< I was rushed for essentially another D&C to remove retained tissue. I always wondered and worried that perhaps I had scarring from the first D&C and the placenta had gotten stuck there, but I don't know if that's true. Having that procedure another time further compounded my concerns.

After that my periods went from 3-4 days of bleeding and 2-3 days of spotting down to 1-2 days of bleeding and 4 days of spotting (I think of it as 1-2 tampon days, 4 pad days). I also experienced ovulation pain for the first time with this change as well.

When we started TTC again, my doc said if it took awhile we could do an x-ray to assess if there was scarring from those two procedures and if it will be a roadblock in future attempts to conceive. She took my concerns seriously and to heart, as your doc should too.

The second RE looked at images from procedure and ordered a 3-d ultrasound and said she thought it was just an arcuate, ""a textbook arcuate"" in her words, which like you said isn't associated with early loss. It's a very long story but my original RE wasn't great at providing us details, but she did communicate she resected some tissue in that area and my uterus isn't as heart-shaped as before. I have no idea, however, if it will actually help as I haven't been able to get pregnant since (asherman's from the resection). \*Shrugs\* I really hope you get answers. It's nice to have something, even though it's heartbreaking to know you've lost because of it, but at least you can treat and have that hope that you'll bring home a baby.

I'm also interested in the DNA frag. I know they did karyotype for both my husband and me, but I'm not actually sure which test confirms that and there's been no mention from my RE.

I think it's definitely a good plan to wait just because you could have a septum and that could be an ""easy"" fix. And if you don't, I know every book I've read on the subject states that women with unexplained RPL still have 60-80% change of having a live birth, so I'm holding onto that. My plan was to just keep trying naturally until I finally did, as harsh as that sounds, but the asherman's diagnosis complicates things. I'm also going to be 35 this year so I feel like the clock is ticking. IDK. It's such a weird situation.

And please feel free to reach out if you ever want to chat. Xx.

Seriously like called the day after the loss and got booked 6 days after the d&c. 
Luckily we don’t need a referral. Also don’t know what insurance will and won’t pay for, but that’s another story. :)

We also told the OB to order chromosomal testing on the products of conception. It hasn’t come back yet.

The RE was very thorough and seemed to know what he was going, and the clinic is a big one with many offices.
Here is what they ordered:

Time-sensitive testing: 
Diagnostic bloodwork and vaginal ultrasound to assess ovarian function on day 2,3, or 4 of my next menstrual cycle (first actual period after the d&c) 
HSG between menstruation and ovulation
Sonohysterogram between menstruation and ovulation 

Completed anytime, including now while I still have pregnancy hormones:
Genetic disease screening for both partners - screens for being carriers of almost 300 diseases
Infectious disease bloodwork for both partners (hiv, hep c, hep b, RPR)
Semen Analysis
Karyotype for both partners - checks for translocations
Routine Bloodwork for female:
Blood group and RH, varicella antibody, AMH, rubella antibody, Complete Blood Count, Vitamin D, and then on the paper it says RPL/ TFT’s

RPL is repeat pregnancy loss and I don’t know what the TFT is. 

The bloodwork slip I gave the lab had 19 different lines for different tests on it and they drew about 15 vials of blood. I know they were checking thyroid and all sorts of things. And they definitely knew that I was only a week post d&c, I double checked that all these tests were ok to do now, and they said yes. They are also ordering bloodwork to follow my hcg down to zero. 

So all in all, almost everything can be tested for before you have your first period, but there are a few tests that need to wait, like hormones at certain days of your cycle, and the “pictures of your parts” tests.

First one saw heartbeat at 6w2d, then it stopped growing 6w3d, gestational sac measured 7ish weeks. Second one I felt the most sick, morning sickness, the whole 9 yards but nothing inside the sac grew past a yolk sac, but the gestational sac was measuring closer to 7 weeks. Now I’m going thru a third loss and we saw the embryo at 5w5d, but the sac was a little smaller, which I was told was due to an SCH. Although it was noted during each loss that I had an SCH. Next ultrasound, nothing grew. All 3 times I start bleeding at the 5 week mark. 

After the second loss, I had RPL blood panel, karyotyping, and SIS. Was given green light to try again and given some super positive stats. This third time I was on progesterone and aspirin but it didn’t help. Now I am seeing a new RE who has some other ideas for more testing such as an MRI and HSG. I’m nervous and scared, but I need to rule these out for peace of mind. Ultimately, the most common cause of early loss is a chromosomal issue within the embryo that your body recognizes.

First one saw heartbeat at 6w2d, then it stopped growing 6w3d, gestational sac measured 7ish weeks. Second one I felt the most sick, morning sickness, the whole 9 yards but nothing inside the sac grew past a yolk sac, but the gestational sac was measuring closer to 7 weeks. Now I’m going thru a third loss and we saw the embryo at 5w5d, but the sac was a little smaller, which I was told was due to an SCH. Although it was noted during each loss that I had an SCH. Next ultrasound, nothing grew. All 3 times I start bleeding at the 5 week mark. </p>

<p>After the second loss, I had RPL blood panel, karyotyping, and SIS. Was given green light to try again and given some super positive stats. This third time I was on progesterone and aspirin but it didn’t help. Now I am seeing a new RE who has some other ideas for more testing such as an MRI and HSG. I’m nervous and scared, but I need to rule these out for peace of mind. Ultimately, the most common cause of early loss is a chromosomal issue within the embryo that your body recognizes. I thought maybe there was a link with SCH but my RE seems to think that is just the body recognizing the unhealthy embryo and so it starts the MC process. It’s devastating either way and we just want answers. We are going to be benched for a bit while we figure this out and plan next steps.</p>

This is anecdotal and I can't promise you'll have the same experience, but I conceived my LC the cycle after I had my CP. My bleeding was maybe a little heavier than a typical cycle was for me back then but the only real effect it had was maybe delaying my ovulation by a couple of days.

This is anecdotal and I can&#39;t promise you&#39;ll have the same experience, but I conceived my LC the cycle after I had my CP. My bleeding was maybe a little heavier than a typical cycle was for me back then but the only real effect it had was maybe delaying my ovulation by a couple of days.

When your BMI was normal, were you on the pill? If not, did your cycles become regular? I know that often happens in typical PCOS cases. 

I have “lean” PCOS with less severe physical symptoms - my biggest issue is that I just don’t ovulate almost ever. My skin and hair tend to be oily and have gotten worse since I went off the pill, but I don’t have a problem with my weight. 

One thing you might want to ask for if your blood work comes up looking like PCOS is for an oral glucose tolerance test. Even though I have lean PCOS and never had evidence of insulin resistance (normal a1c and fasting glucose and insulin), I just learned from this test that I do and will be starting metformin this week. Obviously I can’t tell you if it’s helpful yet but I do wish I had pushed for this testing earlier. If your BMI is normal and you present as lean PCOS, I think doctors are more resistant to metformin so you might have to push on this one. Though the fact that you had weight loss surgery should certainly push them to a more typical PCOS diagnosis. Also, good for you for going through that! 

But of course you don’t have to worry about that until/if you have a diagnosis. If you do and you have questions about what fertility treatment might entail, I’ve gone through a bunch of medications and IUIs, so feel free to ask.

It’s been a little over ten weeks since my D&E. Some days are much harder than others, often with no warning.

-His and hers co-ed baby showers are okay because there are usually more people there and they aren't ALL talking about babies.  Also, you can go with your significant other (major plus).

-Female-only showers are tough.  I don't want to sound misogynistic, but the truth is that women at baby showers talk almost exclusively about babies or their own kids, complain about how miserable the 3rd trimester is (*eye roll*), maybe even have the audacity to ask you when your turn will be.

I found out it was ectopic and they did the Methotrexate right away. I was probably only about 6-8 weeks along or so, but nothing had actually developed, no embryo. Just a growth of cells on my tube. 

They put one injection in each side of my butt. I've never had a butt/thigh injection, so that hurt and felt so weird. I started bleeding and cramping soon after, not right away. My hcg went up at first, which is normal, and then in plummeted. They followed my hcg down to 0 over the next weeks. I had to get blood drawn constantly, but it was reassuring to know the MTX was working. This all took place in October 2018. It made my periods VERY irregular after, like 60 and 45 day cycles. I went to a Reproductive Endocrinologist around April this year and he saw I was just ovulating later and my progesterone wasn't rising high enough to sustain a pregnancy. He put me on Progesterone orally every night after ovulation and BAM I got pregnant that cycle. I am now 12w3d and everything looks healthy and great so far. 

Here's the thing I remember the most: the MTX made my fucking insides HURT. like I could not get out of bed for a few days. I barely ate, I was just SORE on the inside, especially near my stomach. It wasn't unbearable, but it really sucked. I also hated not being able to drink alcohol until my hcg was really low, because all I wanted after going through all of that emotional pain was a big glass of wine. 

You have so many women who understand this situation and who are here for you. It sucks. It really does. I cried a lot and it still hurts to think about. But there was nothing you could do, and you're going to heal and learn from this.

<p>I found out it was ectopic and they did the Methotrexate right away. I was probably only about 6-8 weeks along or so, but nothing had actually developed, no embryo. Just a growth of cells on my tube. </p>

<p>They put one injection in each side of my butt. I&#39;ve never had a butt/thigh injection, so that hurt and felt so weird. I started bleeding and cramping soon after, not right away. My hcg went up at first, which is normal, and then in plummeted. They followed my hcg down to 0 over the next weeks. I had to get blood drawn constantly, but it was reassuring to know the MTX was working. This all took place in October 2018. It made my periods VERY irregular after, like 60 and 45 day cycles. I went to a Reproductive Endocrinologist around April this year and he saw I was just ovulating later and my progesterone wasn&#39;t rising high enough to sustain a pregnancy. He put me on Progesterone orally every night after ovulation and BAM I got pregnant that cycle. I am now 12w3d and everything looks healthy and great so far. </p>

<p>Here&#39;s the thing I remember the most: the MTX made my fucking insides HURT. like I could not get out of bed for a few days. I barely ate, I was just SORE on the inside, especially near my stomach. It wasn&#39;t unbearable, but it really sucked. I also hated not being able to drink alcohol until my hcg was really low, because all I wanted after going through all of that emotional pain was a big glass of wine. </p>

<p>You have so many women who understand this situation and who are here for you. It sucks. It really does. I cried a lot and it still hurts to think about. But there was nothing you could do, and you&#39;re going to heal and learn from this. </p>

<p>If it hadn&#39;t been for my ectopic, I never would have started tracking BBT and learning about hormones and everything. It made me want to learn and grow and work with my body and take care of myself. </p>

Hi Pirate,

Firstly, I’m so sorry for your loss and am thinking of you. This March i got a positive pregnancy test and then the day before 5w i had terrible cramping. I laid in bed and wavered between something terrible is happening and maybe i just have to poop. I woke up the next morning and wiped blood when i peed. I put on a pad and continued to bleed similar to a period just with more clotting. I called my OB and they ordered betas every 48hrs. My results were 72, 104, 164, 165, 192. When my numbers continued to rise even slightly (but obviously not at a viable rate) my OB brought me in for an ultrasound to see if we could see anything. We couldn’t find anything and since my numbers weren’t dropping we ordered the methotrexate shot. I did it right in my OBs and thankfully didn’t have any side effects. My numbers went down quickly. 

I started a period after my betas hit zero, and then had one 30 days later (my normal timing) and got pregnant the following cycle.

<p>Edit: I may be downgrading this to spotting? Thought enough to put a tampon in but there’s barely anything on it. So. 13 day LP? I took a test with a nice obvious indent line. Think it’s negative but I keep being like “is that a hint of pink?” No. I’ll test again tmr if my flow stays the same but my temp went down a bit so. I dunno. It’s so frustrating that I had 4 days of spotting with my first pregnancy - I don’t feel fully OUT until it’s that nice waterfall gushes of blood...</p>

<p>Edit - and the GUSH arrives. </p>

<p>Well. Better LP.</p>

1. I think that telling her what the RE said about the thyroid protocol and asking her opinion on that is a perfect way to phrase it! It allows me to mention it to her without accusing her of doing the wrong thing.  So thank you for that. 

2. Yes, I think I should ask her how or when MFMs get involved since clearly I was confused.

3. At my last appointment, (before we knew there was no heartbeat) I actually asked about this. She said that some patients like to see all the doctors, and some like to have continuity of care with just one doc. She prefers that continuity of care, but is happy to do whatever patients want. I prefer having just the one doc, too. And she said that yes, if you go into natural labor, anyone on duty could deliver. But if I had a scheduled induction or c-section, it would be with her. And she also said that with my hypertension she would likely induce by 39 weeks if I didn’t spontaneously deliver prior to that.

4. Wow, that’s incredible you knew to ask for progesterone for spotting. I spotted early on in both pregnancies also. The doctor on call both times tried to tell me it was implantation bleeding even when it was bright red at six weeks  and I’m pretty sure there is no evidence that implantation causes spotting. So that annoyed me. My ob agreed with my hypothesis the second time that it was most likely friable cervix after seeing no evidence of bleeding on ultrasound.

Anyway, I always try to do as much responsible, evidence-based medical googling as I can as a layperson, so I know what to ask my doctors. But of course, I’m not a doctor and I don’t always know what to ask about. I didn’t know my thyroid levels were supposed to be checked before the 10th week, so I didn’t know to ask for that. I expect my doctors to know more than me. That’s what’s frustrating.

First of all, I am so sorry for your losses. It's hard to come to terms with recurrent pregnancy loss and searching for answers can be frustrating and fruitless. 

You have a few questions so I'll try to address them all. 

1. For your follow up: Your doctor likely knows what she's doing. You can mention that you've met with an RE and they have a recommended protocol for thyroid testing, and ask for her views/opinions on that protocol. But don't assume she doesn't know. 
2. You should definitely ask when / how the MFMs get involved. You can even ask for a consultation with one since you've already had two losses and have quite a few things going on. FWIW, I met with one before trying to get pregnant because of my health issues, and then for my successful pregnancy, I met with him around 10-12 weeks and came up with a game plan for the duration of the pregnancy. 
3. Also ask someone (admin, nurse) if its possible to see ALL of the OBs in the practice vs just one. I'm actually surprised that you stick with only one... because as you said, you could get anyone when you actually deliver. My practice (and many others in my area) let you see a specific doctor of your choice for gynecology but you see anyone and everyone for obstetrics. 
4. A different approach might be to advocate for what you want in the future. I did that with my fourth, successful, pregnancy. My progesterone levels were within the normal range but dropping during my hcg betas early on. I was spotting. I had to travel for work and couldn't come in for additional betas. I advocated for progesterone suppositories because I just knew my levels would drop below normal (it was on the border). They fought me on it, but I was persistent. Who knows if that made the difference, but my 11 month old daughter is now peacefully sleeping in her crib.",[],,t1_ewe1tx0,False,0,[],False,"<div class=""md""><p>TW: mention of living child. </p>

Fucking Mother’s Day on top of all of it. 

In many ways I think we were lucky to be faced with TFMR. I know it’s not a competition, but still. We were provided information that to us was clear and we made a decision. It didn’t feel like much of a choice to us, but ultimately it was. And we knew what we were doing and why - no wondering about what I did or didn’t do to make it happen (though I do sometimes wonder if I did something to make my egg have an abnormality like that, even though we don’t even know whether it was an egg or sperm problem. But why start being rational now?). We were told it was a “fluke” and were tested to make sure it wasn’t inherited and it was not. So I’m sort of grateful for all that in a way if that makes sense. I guess I feel like out of all the terrible ways someone could have a late loss, we had the least terrible. 

I’m sorry your experience was so not like any of that. I can’t imagine. 

It’s frustrating that your mom said that. I know my mom also tries not to cry or make me cry. At first when I was on the phone with her and I would start to cry, she’d change the subject. But I stopped her and told her it’s okay that I’m crying, that what happened is sad. Now she mostly just listens when I’m sad or crying, though I try not to do it too much to her. I never cried in front of my siblings or in-laws or anyone else about it; I’ve always made sure to hold it together in front of those people.

Anyway, I’m done rambling now. So appreciate having someone to talk to about this ❤️",[],,t1_ewchuw2,False,0,[],False,"<div class=""md""><p>What a devastating experience that must’ve been. Fucking Mother’s Day on top of all of it. </p>

<p>In many ways I think we were lucky to be faced with TFMR. I know it’s not a competition, but still. We were provided information that to us was clear and we made a decision. It didn’t feel like much of a choice to us, but ultimately it was. And we knew what we were doing and why - no wondering about what I did or didn’t do to make it happen (though I do sometimes wonder if I did something to make my egg have an abnormality like that, even though we don’t even know whether it was an egg or sperm problem. But why start being rational now?). We were told it was a “fluke” and were tested to make sure it wasn’t inherited and it was not. So I’m sort of grateful for all that in a way if that makes sense. I guess I feel like out of all the terrible ways someone could have a late loss, we had the least terrible. </p>

<p>I’m sorry your experience was so not like any of that. I can’t imagine. </p>

<p>It’s frustrating that your mom said that. I know my mom also tries not to cry or make me cry. At first when I was on the phone with her and I would start to cry, she’d change the subject. But I stopped her and told her it’s okay that I’m crying, that what happened is sad. Now she mostly just listens when I’m sad or crying, though I try not to do it too much to her. I never cried in front of my siblings or in-laws or anyone else about it; I’ve always made sure to hold it together in front of those people. But sometimes I regret that because shouldn’t they see how devastated we are? Should it really be a secret? Like you said, we don’t get a break from it. There is no forgetting. </p>

<p>Anyway, I’m done rambling now. So appreciate having someone to talk to about this ❤️</p>

I was admitted to the hospital on a Sunday evening (May 12, fucking Mother’s Day), they told us about me being in preterm labor and them not being able to stop it and the likelihood that I would have the boys very soon and they would not live if they didn’t make it past 24 weeks and we needed to decide our plan if that happened.

We had a D&E. No one asked if we would prefer that I was induced.

So I think on balance it was the choice we would’ve made had we been given it. Then again maybe that’s what I have to tell myself to deal. Who even knows anymore.

I feel the same way about telling people. Like it’s urgently important to do so, but I find myself holding back because I don’t want to upset people and I also tend to tear up when I start talking about her. But it’s hard to stop. Sometimes my husband is somewhat crass about it and says the words “dead baby” and that is definitely off-putting to people. My sister-in-law said it made her uncomfortable and my husband responded with “not as uncomfortable it makes us to *have* a dead baby.” 

So. That’s probably not great. But I’m with you on wanting people to hear about her. Maybe it’s about having people understand how very real she was. And maybe that requires making them uncomfortable.

<p>Her urn sounds so beautiful. I’m sure you will get to the point of wanting to display it but if you don’t, that’s okay too. This is such a personal journey and so much of it feels private. I find myself so anxious to share the details of my babies with everyone just so that the burden of their short lives isn’t resting completely on my husband and I. But I know that people don’t want to hear about dead babies and I can’t decide whether I just want people to feel the discomfort I feel or what. It’s so confusing. </p>

<p>Sending you a giant hug ❤️. PM me if you ever just want someone to listen.</p>

Regarding counselling, the waiting list is 4 weeks which isn't bad but I know that by the time I get that call I will be out of this low point which is what happened last time.

I would really really like to join a group so will look into that this evening. This Reddit group has been so helpful.

<p>Well, we&#39;ve had tests on the last two pregnancies and it seems to be egg quality which isn&#39;t really treatable. We&#39;ve been referred to a specialist research clinic in the UK and the appointment is next week. Kind of pinning hopes on that. IVF with PGS is definitely what we will look into if it happens a fifth time.</p>

<p>I&#39;m sorry about your situation too - and you&#39;re going through the miscarriage now. It&#39;s just a rollercoaster isn&#39;t it.</p>

Very quick summary- conceived on Clomid after TTC for a year. Then had two MC and an ectopic on my last dose of Clomid. So 3 failed pregancies. Currently trying to lose weight for IVF.

I have been back to work for 4 months now since the surgery of my ectopic and although been tough I've been able to cope okay. Over the past 2 weeks I've gone rapidly downhill. Looking at it I think it's down to my best friend getting pregnant and reaching her 12 week scan and my husband's good friend announcing their news. Both these couples weren't even thinking about having children when we started trying nearly 3 years ago. I feel like we're being left behind and now all our friends either have children, on their second or currently pregnant. I've had counselling from a local loss organisation and I don't think I need to go back.

The dilemma - Since Sunday, so now on my third day, I haven't been able to go a few hours without crying. I'm really struggling. I'm considering having some time off work to sort myself out but also thinking about toughing it out a bit longer to see if I get past it.

The cramps and bleeding is unpleasant but it feels oddly relieving to pass the big clots. Super weird and hard to describe. Like a good poop? It’s so gross. But like, good to get them out. 

I’m also frustrated that I have my first RE appointment Wednesday and my OB’s office said it could take them up to a month to get my records to them. I had to sign a form and send it back, and they could make no promises. WTF!?
My GP’s office just asked for the RE’s fax number and said they would send stuff over right away!

Also frustrated that my OB doesn’t know anything about what kind of testing specifically the genetics department does on the fetal tissue. I know nothing about this stuff, I’m not a doctor or even a scientist, but I have been reading up on it and it seems there is a recommended protocol to follow.  And I need to know if their lab is doing this, or if they stop at the first tier. 
First my doc gave me some info that was wrong (karyotyping is only done on parents, not fetal tissue). Then she admitted she didn’t know and gave me the phone number for the genetics department. Which I’m sure will just be a receptionist who won’t know what I’m talking about. Ugh. Maybe my RE can call and ask them.

My OB is wonderful for pregnancy, but fertility is not his interest!</p>

If you're on cycle 11 and havent checked out r/ stilltrying or r/ infertility, you might want to. I'm not saying you're going to have problems, I'm just saying those are the two subs that discuss ttc in the most scientific way possible. I was on there after like... 3 months of trying because I was tired of reading about people swearing wearing socks after bding got them pregnant or that a special tea gave them twins... I swear every times I'd google a question about a symptom or ttc I'd get those kinds of answers. The subs I mentioned are filled with women and men working with the experts already so all the bs is already way out the window bc no one has time for it. 

What I can tell you based off what you've said is that you cant confirm O just off opks and symptoms like cramps. Youd have to be temping to actually confirm it. The window for O after a positive opk is pretty big. You might've just O'd a day or two later than you think. On the plus side that means maybe you actually arent 16dpo and a positive test isnt quite possible yet bc it's too early. That being said, the standard phrase is ""if you're pregnant enough to feel symptoms, youre pregnant enough to get a positive."" I'm sure there are plenty of people who anecdotally got a bfp after a slew of negatives but realistically they probably misjudged their O day and were testing too early to begin with. Progesterone is a super B*tch who likes to get our hopes up every month just to make an already crappy process worse. 

I hope this is your month. Loss and having to try for 11 months is so demoralizing. That one year mark looming makes it ten times worse. Ugh I sympathize so much.

It turned out to be a good group.  We weren't the only TFMR couple there.  And among the rotating volunteer facilitators, there was one (very Catholic) woman who'd had a TFMR.

I can't guarantee every group will be supportive--depends on geography, the facilitators, etc.  But a ""general"" support group can sometimes work.

Reading people’s stories really helped me when I was going through this so here’s mine. I took misoprostol at the end of June for my MC. I was 5.5 weeks along.

Still, I only had minimal spotting but pretty bad diarrhea and nausea for the rest of the day. By 6/23, the nausea and diarrhea were gone. I still was not actively bleeding and the spotting was only happening when I was sitting on the toilet. I was so frustrated and thought the medication wasn’t working so I called my OB the morning of 6/24. The nurse said the spotting may have been enough to pass the tissue since I was so early in the pregnancy and to wait for my follow up u/s to see what the next steps were. That afternoon, I began bleeding bright red blood and cramping. I finally passed the tissue around 1030 that night. I continued bleeding for the next 5 days then had spotting for another week or so. My follow up ultrasound showed everything passed so luckily I didn’t have to have a D&C.

<p>While we are TTC our RE said that once we get close to ovulation we should BD every other day in case my wife ovulates on her own before we can trigger to avoid missing our window of conception. </p>

<p>If there is no male factor you can BD every other day leading up to the peak and then do it that day and at least the day after. I would say as long as you did it the first day you have a good chance as the 2nd day would only raise the chance by a little bit.</p>

I had my 1st appointment today with the fertility clinic. There are only 3 more tests that she said she can do for me. I am waiting on blood work right now for beta2glycoprotein, she scheduled me for a sonohysterogram next week, and she said if that doesn't show any issues she is also willing to do an endometrial biopsy since I used to have an IUD and a lining infection is possible. Otherwise all our testing is done and there is nothing abnormal. The dr expressed that this is good news and we still have a chance for a successful pregnancy despite our losses. She wants us to try 3 more months and if we dont have a pregnancy (since we have gone 7 cycles without a pregnancy) she will do iui. So I feel drained, and it's hard to still be told there is nothing that seems to be wrong when there so obviously is. But we have a plan. 

Also, in terms of supplements she said extra folic acid may actually be bad as too much seems to cause some problems. She ok'd me to take what's in my prenatal plus 1 mg of methyl folate since I was worried that I guess they won't test for mthfr in Canada. She said I can keep taking that if it makes me feel better but she didn't think it was necessary. She said there is no harm in continuing coq10 but there are no human trials  that prove it helps only rodent ones. She also said that with my results there is no evidence that taking baby aspirin will help and that progesterone supplementation is also unnecessary as it has a cyclical hormone pattern and I ovulate and have no luteal phase defect. 

I also asked her about whether my weightloss of 60 lbs could be somehow preventing pregnancy. She said my weightloss to a healthy weight is good as long as I have continued to ovulate but may shock the body. So my SO wants me to move from keto to low carb and stop losing weight. I am struggling with this one but agreed with him that I will try it.

I had my 1st appointment today with the fertility clinic. There are only 3 more tests that she said she can do for me. I am waiting on blood work right now for beta2glycoprotein, she scheduled me for a sonohysterogram next week, and she said if that doesn&#39;t show any issues she is also willing to do an endometrial biopsy since I used to have an IUD and a lining infection is possible. Otherwise all our testing is done and there is nothing abnormal. The dr expressed that this is good news and we still have a chance for a successful pregnancy despite our losses. She wants us to try 3 more months and if we dont have a pregnancy (since we have gone 7 cycles without a pregnancy) she will do iui. So I feel drained, and it&#39;s hard to still be told there is nothing that seems to be wrong when there so obviously is. But we have a plan. </p>

I&#39;m goign to test tomorrow morning since it&#39;ll be CD19 and I had my first peak OPK on CD16. I will report back with rewsults. Ideally you&#39;re meant to have a baseline one on CD8 or something, but obviously I just got them and I&#39;m not waiting until  next cycle when I could be obsessing about THIS CYCLE.</p>

I had new insurance, so I took advantage, found a new MFM specialist at a different hospital (it's a great teaching hospital near my house that makes a lot of medical advancements), who immediately sent me to see a fertility specialist for my own piece of mind. In February/March, we did more testing, including another sonohystogram and semen analysis, and was told, again, that there was no reason we shouldn't be getting pregnant, but if it would help with my mental health, then we could pursue IUI.

That being said, I'm only doing my first round of IUI this month, because I needed that time to determine if that's what I wanted.

My experience with an RE has been that they are super helpful, especially in cases where a loss has occurred. They will also just talk to you about your options. I can't say how happy I am that I switched doctors, hospitals, and specialists. It's given me so much piece of mind.

Fast forward to January 2019 - haven&#39;t gotten pregnant, been trying since the previous March, and I was getting frustrated. I had new insurance, so I took advantage, found a new MFM specialist at a different hospital (it&#39;s a great teaching hospital near my house that makes a lot of medical advancements), who immediately sent me to see a fertility specialist for my own piece of mind. In February/March, we did more testing, including another sonohystogram and semen analysis, and was told, again, that there was no reason we shouldn&#39;t be getting pregnant, but if it would help with my mental health, then we could pursue IUI. My RE doesn&#39;t believe in giving fertility drugs without IUI, because in his experience, the rate of success with just medication isn&#39;t much higher than non-medicated, but medicated IUI is much greater. That being said, I&#39;m only doing my first round of IUI this month, because I needed that time to determine if that&#39;s what I wanted.</p>

<p>My experience with an RE has been that they are super helpful, especially in cases where a loss has occurred. They will also just talk to you about your options. I can&#39;t say how happy I am that I switched doctors, hospitals, and specialists. It&#39;s given me so much piece of mind. </p>

<p>Best of luck.</p>

I've had 3MCs since 2017, no living children, and will be 35 at the end of the year so I understand the pressure to get things moving. How can you not when it's drilled into your head that 35+ is the danger zone?! My husband and I were arguing a lot because we've since struggled to conceive after a uterine surgery in February. Every month and another negative just added this huge weight and I felt like I was suffocating. TTC during the FW was hell. It kind of all blew up last month so we finally sat down and had a long talk. We both just put it all out there and it's helped to be on same page. We have many obstacles that I hope you'll never encounter and we'll do everything we can on our end but we have to let everything else go as there's only so much we can control. We've also looked into alternatives, the mosie or IUI, so that TTC isn't ruining our marriage if it gets to that place again.

I also know I had real trouble focusing on anything other than my TTC goal these last couple of months but am easing my way back into things I enjoyed before and I think it helps to take some of the pressure off. Hopefully just being in this space and venting with others who understand can also provide some relief.

Again, I'm so sorry you have to be here. I've really struggled with the secondary losses, which kills optimism, because I just didn't anticipate the magnitude it of all.

For example: FF looks at my past 8 cycles and tells me that I’m probably ovulating on CD14, because it’s averaging what has happened to me the last 8 cycles - it has nothing to do with other women. If I input conflicting data that suggests I’ve ovulated earlier or later (like a positive OPK, or fertile CM, or a temp jump), FF adjusts immediately to reflect what is actually happening with my body.

Other apps (like Glow, Clue, Premom, Ovia, etc.) have an algorithm that says that women with cycles my same length tend to ovulate on a certain day, and that’s where their prediction comes from. While I can use the app to record info on temp, CM, OPKs, etc. for my records, the app doesn’t use my info to change their algorithm, so it’s more of a record book that also tells you when most people with your same cycle length ovulate. Better than nothing, but not as good as FF.

Some apps also make OPKs the deciding factor, and automatically put ovulation the day after a positive OPK, with no regard for other signs of fertility. Both Premom and Clue do this. I think they are designed to make it simpler for the user, but I just find it more confusing in the end.

The only app I can think of besides FF that I would recommend is OvaGraph, which is the one from TCOYF.

It&#39;s not as much about my pregnant friend, who I am so happy for, but all of her friends have had like 3 babies and are SAHMs who complain about how busy they are/how hart it is/etc.  It&#39;s just so much baby stuff.</p>
