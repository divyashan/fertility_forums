The methotrexate didn‚Äôt work so I had to get surgery and lost my right tube. One of the hardest things has been other people‚Äôs reactions‚Äîthey‚Äôre not bad but it‚Äôs such a scary situation. Most people know someone who‚Äôs had a miscarriage but ectopic is much more rare. And most of my friends didn‚Äôt realize that the surgery meant losing a tube until I explained it and they were shocked. Then I felt like I was scaring them so needless to say it‚Äôs hard to talk about. I know exactly how you feel about trying again, I‚Äôm terrified of a repeat incident. But I also feel stronger from having had to go through the experience and realizing I‚Äôm more resilient than I give myself credit for. I‚Äôm hoping that will help when I try again. Know that you‚Äôre not alone in this and I‚Äôm always happy to talk.</p>

I believe in divine calculation and that things come to you at a time when you're in the perfect position to receive them.

I TFMR for a different (very rare) chromosomal abnormality. My story is probably not going to be particularly helpful but here it goes:

I have PCOS and rarely ovulate on my own. It took five IUIs over the course of eight months (several cancelled cycles in there) to conceive our first. 

After TFMR, we were torn - more than anything we want a living child but we were also grieving a lot and didn‚Äôt want to rush into anything before we were ready. We saw my RE eight weeks after my D&E and talked through options. My RE was going on vacation and the timing made it so we‚Äôd be waiting another month to try, which would put the end of my cycle right at our first‚Äôs due date, and I just couldn‚Äôt do it. Overall we decided we were grieving and physically it would probably be better to give my body more time to recover, so we decided we‚Äôd go back to treatment after her due date (September 23). 

However, we didn‚Äôt use protection. Since I never ovulate and even when I did it repeatedly didn‚Äôt take, it seemed like a nonissue. I had resumed taking prenatals and extra folate to rebuild stores, but drank socially. We knew the risk and decided it was unlikely but we‚Äôd be happy if it happened. 

Well, it happened. Turns out I ovulated just over nine weeks after my D&E and we had sex around then and somehow, despite everything, it took. I found out a couple weeks later as I was periodically taking tests to make sure I could keep drinking (though I had skipped a couple weeks of tests since it seemed so outlandish). 

Here I am, 17 weeks and 3 days pregnant. I‚Äôll be honest - it‚Äôs been hard. I miss my daughter. As the holidays approach, all I can think about is how this should be our daughter‚Äôs first holiday season. She should be here. I try to get excited about this baby, but it often doesn‚Äôt really work. 

We did a CVS early even though the abnormality wasn‚Äôt inherited - we just couldn‚Äôt sit around and not know and have also just become scared of any possible defect. It came back totally normal, which was a relief. However, our anatomy scan is on Wednesday and I am fully freaking out. 

So, this pregnancy is hard. It‚Äôs stressful to think that something could be wrong - I don‚Äôt know that I could survive another TFMR. I miss my daughter a lot. My husband and I have been very open with each other through with our grieving process and attended an in-person support group, which definitely helped us. Time has also helped. But the grief is still there. 

I will say that even though this pregnancy has had all those challenges, I imagine the holidays/life in general would be even harder if we were currently trying and failing to get pregnant. But I think if someone had asked me if being pregnant now would make me feel better I‚Äôd have thought yes and it really hasn‚Äôt. 

So my advice is to work through your grief and not rush into pregnancy because you think it‚Äôll fix everything. I wish I could say the opposite of all of this - that getting pregnant fairly quickly has been very healing and led to lots of happiness. Maybe for some people it does, and maybe it‚Äôs at least partly because we weren‚Äôt expecting this, but I think generally it‚Äôs not really a fix.

My doctor told me that sometimes the first cycle after miscarriage is anovulatory, and everyone‚Äôs cycle is affected differently. It is incredibly frustrating to not know what‚Äôs going on. I finally got a negative HPT on Nov 13, 27 days after my first day of bleeding. I‚Äôm anxious to get pregnant again so have been BD-ing at least every other day since the bleeding has stopped, but I tested again yesterday and still got a negative.

It‚Äôs the worst feeling ever and I don‚Äôt even know how to begin to move forward at all. I feel so empty inside with them gone. I don‚Äôt even feel like the same person. My mom did admit that she‚Äôs been worried about my health and was worried that I could die. I kind of laughed at her and said I‚Äôm dying just on the inside. So it did help me see that she‚Äôs just as much worried about her child just like I would have been with mine. I‚Äôm so sorry have gone thorough so many miscarriages, but it also shows you have a lot of strength to not give up.</p>

So a low TSH is indicative of potential hyperthyroid problems, but that being said, it's not certain. You have to get your Free T4 and Free T3 levels tested, because those are the actual thyroid hormone levels. TSH alone doesn't really tell us anything.

TSH is pretty much the signals your brain sends to your thyroid telling it to produce more or less hormone. 

Your TSH could have been affected by your pregnancy. Mine was 0.02 at one point during pregnancy, and 0.2 another time. My T4 and T3 were normal both these times. Once all the pregnancy hormone cleared out and I wasn't pregnant for almost 2 months, my TSH was back in normal ranges.

Your TPO antibodies are elevated, but not by much. Mine were 268, for example. Others on here have had them in the thousands. So don't freak out! Elevated thyroid antibodies basically indicate that you may have a problem in the future with your thyroid (because your thyroid is being attacked by these antibodies), but it doesn't mean you have thyroid issues right now. For example, my RE was totally not concerned with my antibodies and said that SO many women have elevated antibodies. It just means that we'll need to watch my thyroid and test is more often to see if it ever gets to a point where it gets damaged. It may or may not. I did have another doctor say it increases odds of miscarriage, but studies on that seem inconclusive. There's also no treatment for elevated antibodies. The only thing I've found is that dietary changes could help, such as cutting out gluten, dairy and soy. This is what I'm trying now.

All of this is to say - don't freak out! They probably want to get you in to repeat your TSH test and probably also test your Free T4 and Free T3 to get a better idea of what's going on in your thyroid. Mine was retested like 4-5 times before anyone was able to actually comment on what was going on. Even if you DO have a thyroid issue, it's easily manageable with medication and monitoring and it will definitely not stop you from having a baby.

Elevated thyroid antibodies basically indicate that you may have a problem in the future with your thyroid (because your thyroid is being attacked by these antibodies), but it doesn&#39;t mean you have thyroid issues right now. For example, my RE was totally not concerned with my antibodies and said that SO many women have elevated antibodies. It just means that we&#39;ll need to watch my thyroid and test is more often to see if it ever gets to a point where it gets damaged. It may or may not. I did have another doctor say it increases odds of miscarriage, but studies on that seem inconclusive. There&#39;s also no treatment for elevated antibodies. The only thing I&#39;ve found is that dietary changes could help, such as cutting out gluten, dairy and soy. This is what I&#39;m trying now.</p>

<p>All of this is to say - don&#39;t freak out! They probably want to get you in to repeat your TSH test and probably also test your Free T4 and Free T3 to get a better idea of what&#39;s going on in your thyroid. Mine was retested like 4-5 times before anyone was able to actually comment on what was going on. Even if you DO have a thyroid issue, it&#39;s easily manageable with medication and monitoring and it will definitely not stop you from having a baby.</p>

<p>Good luck! ‚ô•</p>

I know there are several ladies who have mentioned going on it in the past and I am seriously considering asking for some meds after how hard I took CD1 this time. I think my feelings of depression and anxiety around this are purely situational. I have never needed to be on anti depressants before and the only time I have had anxiety that needed to be medicated was when my mom died. I currently feel like every failed cycle spirals me deeper into depression though am I really not pulling out of it very well as the cycle progresses like I have in the past.

When they first suspected an ectopic, my consultant, who was a specialist with early pregnancy, told me that if no ectopic was found they would continue to monitor me.

It certainly was very scary...I went in expecting everything to be normal on the scan, then was told it was potentially life threatening and I needed emergency surgery, only to come round and be told it was nothing.

1. Always test at the same time each morning, before you drink, speak, or sit up. Therefore you should keep your thermometer on your nightstand of within easy reach when you‚Äôre lying down.
2. Make sure you‚Äôre using a thermometer with two decimal points, not one. For example, a reading should be 96.34 F, not 96.3 F. 
3. Try to keep the house at the same temperature at night. Changing the thermostat a few degrees could affect your resting temps. 
4. Get at least 4 hours of continuous sleep. Your basal body temp is your body at rest, so you can‚Äôt sleep for an hour and then take your temp. 
5. Relax. It can take a few cycles to see what your normal is. Personally, I ovulate on CD 17-19. Sometimes I have dips mid cycle that resemble implantation dips and sometimes not. Sometimes my temp has stayed high (which indicates progesterone has not dropped yet) and still gotten my period, and other months I‚Äôve had a perfect biphasic chart (or triphasic, which is supposed to indicate a pregnancy but can show up in any chart) and gotten my period the day that my temp dropped below the cover line. 
6. Since you‚Äôre going to use an app/website, you won‚Äôt be drawing your own cover line, but the basics are- 
     A. First half of cycle- temps should be relatively low but can spike during your period/fertility drug days. 
    B. Ovulation- you may see a drop in your temperature, followed by a temperature spike the next day that is higher than the last few readings on your chart. 
   C. To confirm ovulation, your temperature should remain higher (your chart should have a clear before/after look) for the rest of your cycle. When you near your expected period start day, your temp should start to fall, indicating falling progesterone and your body readying itself for another cycle.

I‚Äôve found that ‚Äúfaking it till I make it‚Äù actually works. Having a routine and going about normal activities helps. At the same time, allowing myself to feel my feelings also helps. To that end, being open about what happened and how it makes me feel is also freeing.

HSG
Saline sono
All the blood tests for repeat pregnancy loss
Complete karyotype on us both
Cd3 Hormone blood tests
Semen analysis
Antral follicle count
And we sent away for a sperm dna frag year feom SCSA our of pocket for $450. Insirwnce wouldn‚Äôt cover anyway and our RE only tests that if you‚Äôve failed IVF a few times. I was NOT going to wait and I am so glad we did it for peace of mind (my husbands frag level was low)</p>

<p>Our REntold is that 50% of the time, testing for repeat loss comes up with nothing. That doesn‚Äôt mean there IS nothing wrong, just nothing wrong that current medical science can find. He also said that after two or three unexplained miscarriages, your chance at a live birth is still good and only slightly less than for anyone else.</p>

<p>That said. I know next time I‚Äôm pregnant I‚Äôll be a fucking wreck. I‚Äôll be more of a wreck if we have more losses. The first one was fine. Yay! At least we know we can get pregnant. The second one was devastating. I can‚Äôt even allow myself to really imagine three or four or more. My heart goes out to you.</p>

My understanding is that the risks are generally pretty low, but obviously you want to check with your OB to make sure there isn‚Äôt some problem with your blood that would make it dangerous for you to use.

Also, to reassure you, it took maybe a week for my hematologist and OB to confer and look at the blood work and come to a decision.

<p>As far as the the the napro ob I get why some women would be apprehensive. Me being one of them. I‚Äôm so happy it worked well for you. I grew up with a very religious upbringing and due to that I have steered very far from GOD or anything Jesus related. Especially after my hospital denying my d and e and having to stay pregnant for two weeks with my dead baby to wait for a hospital to take me. </p>

<p>But I do hope that my OB remembers my case and is understanding enough to run a full thyroid and blood clotting panel. Just had to vent and be pessimistic for a bit before getting myself ready for the next part.</p>

I am so freaking grateful to have found your post. I am very similar (and I am 20!) and I wanted to share my experience with you so you know you aren't crazy.

In February, after having an IUD in place for almost a year, I got pregnant. I was scared and made a choice to get an ab0rtion because I thought that was expected of me, even though in my heart I knew I wanted to keep it. I went through a lot of trauma with this, and felt really guilty. Still do.

It was determined that my IUD was placed incorrectly, and since I am sensitive to hormones, I got another IUD (copper both times). In June, I got pregnant once again on the new IUD. My partner remained the same (still with him) both times. This time around, we were so happy. Both of us felt a lot of sadness and regret from the ab0rtion, and had been wishing we could have had more time to make a decision. We budgeted everything, got excited, and then I began bleeding. We were out of the country and I ended up spending three weeks in a foreign hospital that did not understand english with an ectopic pregnancy. I felt like my world had collapsed.

Now, I am on a new birth control with really low estrogen. We check the condoms before and after sex for any tears or breaks. We have sex once every 1-2 months.

I am very similar (and I am 20!) and I wanted to share my experience with you so you know you aren&#39;t crazy.</p>

<p>In February, after having an IUD in place for almost a year, I got pregnant. I was scared and made a choice to get an ab0rtion because I thought that was expected of me, even though in my heart I knew I wanted to keep it. I went through a lot of trauma with this, and felt really guilty. Still do.</p>

<p>It was determined that my IUD was placed incorrectly, and since I am sensitive to hormones, I got another IUD (copper both times). In June, I got pregnant once again on the new IUD. My partner remained the same (still with him) both times. This time around, we were so happy. Both of us felt a lot of sadness and regret from the ab0rtion, and had been wishing we could have had more time to make a decision. We budgeted everything, got excited, and then I began bleeding. We were out of the country and I ended up spending three weeks in a foreign hospital that did not understand english with an ectopic pregnancy. I felt like my world had collapsed. It seemed like the universe was punishing me. I am still recovering from this one.</p>
