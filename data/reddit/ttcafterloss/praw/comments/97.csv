We went in for a 12 Week NT scan and were told about a myriad of deformalities that were basically fatal.

There just wasn't a way to move forward on the decision until we could have someone else confirm if. 

The next day, we got another ultrasound which not only confirmed the diagnosis but actually gave us a even worse mortality rate. It actually did give us a bit more closure because we were in a calmer headspace and not still in shock. We were able to ask questions calmly and while we still cried, whe were in a better headspace to figure out next steps. 

So yes, it does extend the process but for us, we would have been tossing and turning for months on the what ifs. You hear about people misreading things all the time, what if I'm that person? Nowadays we know that these doctors triple check what they're doing (our ultrasound tech had to send it to a radiologist in another room who sent it to a maternal fetal medicine doc and they all confirmed it).

I live in Savannah Ga. Not as big a city as others and a bit more slow paced. My ob is currently open for physical visits, so getting in to see her won't be a problem I'll just have to let my daughter stay with my dad for an hour or so because we aren't allowed to bring anyone else. 

When finding out the sex of our baby she can write it down and place it in an envelope so that my husband and I can find out together. During delivery he will be allowed, BUT he cannot leave the hospital until I've had the baby and is discharged. Like last year when I lost my son I'm certain my mother n law will take my daughter until we get home. 

I'm 30 and will be 31 in December. Last year after giving birth my doctor told me to wait a year and not be in a rush. I told her I'm getting older and don't have that much time. She informed me that with my health, and ease of getting pregnant that I have until about 36 to safely and naturally have babies.

So yes, I suppose I can wait until next year and try but after losing a baby things change. We initially wanted two kids. We have a daughter, 7, and was pregnant with our little man. We should have been done but I suppose God had/has different plans for us. Anywho, I now want 3 kids! The last two no more than 2 years apart. This is why I don't want to wait but also don't need my emotions making decisions for me.

My husband is of little help, bless his heart..lol. He wanted to try again immediately and when I ask him about now he says the ""husband thing"" - I'll support whatever your decision is. 

I'll continue to pray about it. Like I've stated, I ovulate August 11 so if I get pregnant then hopefully it was meant to be and if not then....we'll see.

The biggest factors for me are- do you live someplace with good resources, not in a hotspot, and where people are taking things seriously? Where I live the governor is taking things very seriously and has been since the beginning. If I lived in a hotspot or somewhere where people were not taking things seriously I might wait awhile, or if I lived somewhere with very limited access to care that might also influence my decision.
My second factor would be age. Of course there is nothing wrong with ttc right now if you are younger but for me personally if I felt like I had a lot of time left I might wait a little bit. But I will be 35 soon, have had two CPs, etc. Let‚Äôs say a vaccine gets approved and available super quickly, so let‚Äôs be really optimistic and say February for ex. So I get the vaccine and even if I get pregnant right away (won‚Äôt happen) I wouldn‚Äôt have a baby until the following November. If I can help it, no way am I waiting that long.
In terms of resources, again I suppose that depends on where you live and honestly that would only be an issue if God forbid something went wrong. Regular OBs are not caring for Covid patients unless those patients are already pregnant. And in terms of appointments, yes it might suck not having your partner there, but even if you got pregnant this month you probably wouldn‚Äôt have an appointment until Sept/Oct anyway and perhaps your practice will have changed rules by then, and a lot of places will allow you to do Facetime etc. In terms of delivery I think that unless you are in a really bad hotspot pretty much everywhere will allow the father or a support person with you. Even in NYC when it was really bad Gov Cuomo ruled that hospitals had to allow one person with the mother at least during the actual delivery. And even if you got pregnant this second you won‚Äôt have the baby for nine months; so much can happen in that time.

I already had 4 other friends (different friend groups, not one group together), I was the last one to join the club. Everytime someone passed the 12 weeks, we got so excited and happy for eachother, and we were sharing everything about our early pregnancies. We mentioned how scary the miscarriage statistics were, but we did not want to think about it. Unfortunately, at my second ultra sound at 10 weeks, excited to hear the heartbeat, we found out there was no heartbeat, and our little soul passed away couple days before. It was a crazy blur, I do not remember that much anymore, and I had a d&c the day after.. 

My friends were all in shock. One friend (only 2 weeks apart, her second baby) went through the same thing couple years before. I was still able to call her. But I had not seen her up until 3 weeks ago.... (covid here in Belgium was also a reason but I could not see her in person during her pregnancy). But we called often to vent.. because she knew what it was like to go through a loss and d&c. She was very much okay with me not wanting to see her in person,  but she sent me a picture every now and then when she knew I had ""a good day"", because she thought it was important to keep me updated. I would have been (and I am right now) a big part of her children's life, and she refused to back off completely. I still love her for that.. 

One other friend is also my colleague at school. Starting back up in September after that really rough Summer was the worst. I did not want to see her, I did not want to hug her or even get close to her baby bump because I was missing my pregnancy soooo hard. She wrote me a letter.. and the first day of school after a meeting, i saw her and ran to her and we hugged for 15 minutes. And cried.. ugly cried. And I felt her little baby bump but I did not mind.. she still needed me also as a friend (pregnancy gave her tonnes of anxiety) and it was okay the months after. We were very open about everything and she gave me all the space I needed without backing off completely.

My other 2 friends were the cautious ones. Those were the difficult ones. It is still weird and kinda distant right now. A year later! They kept feeling sorry for me. They kept feeling bad for me and hopped on the pity train.. (""poor her"", ""I won't share anything baby related"", ""so sad what happened'...). They kept doing this even tho I started to ask about them and their babies after a couple of months. They made a new Whatsapp group where they could vent together without me (to protect me!) But it took forever for them to realise that at one point, i just want to be part of their lives again. Up until this day, they STILL put themselves second and are scared to share something in a group with me in it... to be honest, even tho I really needed a break from my pregnant friends after my loss (which is TOTALLY NORMAL!), I needed my friends to tell me: hey, sorry about what happened, but I need you too.. and I will  give you space,  but know that I need you too. 

So 2 friends out of 4 are still very close. The 2 others.. it's difficult. I'm sure, the day we have kids (if!), that will change again. But i noticed it is very hard for them to be around me. They feel so bad and guilty, and are too afraid to let me back in. 

So my advice. Take time.. as much as you need. Be aware that your close friends (pregnant or not) also need you.. so when you're ready, let them know you are also there for them. Real close friendships only come out stronger out of these situations. 

Oh and PS: i love all of the babies. It is always (and will always be) weird to hold one of them because it reminds me of how ours would have been. But I love them. And my friends let me cry on a bad day.. and cry with me. Which is pretty beautiful. And the day we finally ttc (in fertility right now) the joy will be indescribable. Pretty sure about that.

It may not be the right time for everyone, but we‚Äôre going to try again. I (personally, and there‚Äôs no judgement to anyone who prefers to wait) don‚Äôt want to wait for ‚Äúthe right time‚Äù. Everything with this pregnancy had all been complete flukes. I don‚Äôt know how long it‚Äôll take us to naturally conceive, and I don‚Äôt want to put it off too long. With that being said, I really enjoyed being off work for my whole first trimester and I‚Äôm hoping to somehow swing that same situation again next time if I feel the same way! 

Everywhere is different in response to doctors and hospitals. With mine, my husband was only allowed at the final appointment. But, we were also able to book elective ultrasounds that he could go to. He would‚Äôve been able to go into delivery with me. As of right now, my hospital of choice is allowing one support person. 

As far as resources go, in my situation, everything was separate from any Covid units. So, that may not be an issue at all.

All of this is to say, no one can tell YOU when the right time is for YOU to have a baby. Things suck now, but is that enough for you to want to push things back? (Once again, personal choice, only you know what‚Äôs right for you.) I understand the concerns, I do.

I think part of the reason why miscarriages are so painful is that they are not treated the same as other losses. The hardest part is feeling that you have to carry your grief by yourself. If we treated a miscarriage the same as a loss of any other family member and could talk about it and be open about it, I think it would be easier.

I didn&#39;t feel like I really owed her an explanation and she would figure it out when in 6 months there&#39;s no baby or the fact that I&#39;m not getting any larger. I have also been drinking this summer and I&#39;m sure she&#39;s seen me with wine or a beer or whatever out in the yard and figured she&#39;d get the hint. Well today our kids were playing and we were chatting and she asked &quot;are you telling people you&#39;re pregnant?&quot; and she even like rubbed her belly indicating like obviously I&#39;m pregnant because of my belly. You guys it&#39;s been 2 months. And I know I have and extra 10 pounds hanging around because I guess it&#39;s harder to lose weight when you miscarry vs when you have a baby and breastfeed all your chub away. But I mean come on lady! I definitely don&#39;t think I look pregnant any more not like I did at the end of May, just maybe a little chubby around my middle.  She was really sorry and sweet about it and told me about her losses in the past. But Ugh I just feel <em>feelings</em> again about the whole thing. Like going thru all that alone in a pandemic and having to tell everyone bad news after just having told them good news and not to mention now I just feel FAT. Anyway I just needed to tell someone who understands. Thanks for listening.</p>

I'm from the February bumper sub as well and experienced my first loss on July 13th with my first ever pregnancy (found out at 2nd early ultrasound). I personally found that it gets much easier with time.

The first few days were the hardest. Being pregnant still, with all of the symptoms and hormones, was so hard. I cried a lot. I cried at the ultrasound, I cried in the car on the way home, and I cried randomly all day. I cried first thing in the morning, and at random times for the many days after. I found that crying was cathartic - letting myself feel the pain and crying it out was better for me than trying to hold it in.

Then I wanted it to be over and to have the non-viable pregnancy out of me as soon as possible, but for me it took a few weeks to finally have my d&c. As I became more 'adjusted' to the reality of my situation, it got a little easier but those weeks before my d&c were still hard. The d&c was difficult emotionally but the doctors and nurses were kind and it was over very quickly. The few days after that were super emotional again due to the hormones changing so quickly and the reality of not being pregnant anymore. Things got much better after day 3 or so. (Sorry if you aren't in a place to think about what comes next yet, I just remember feeling really scared about next steps and what they would be like and when I would feel 'normal' physically again, so I thought this info might help).

I am two and a half weeks out from my d&c and I feel so, so much better. I still feel sad, and get reminded of my loss by a lot of random things, but I feel like me again. My symptoms are gone, which for me has been really nice. I am not nauseous all the time, I have energy again, and I feel healthy. I am also ready to try again right away, so it has been nice to see signs of my cycle returning.

You are in the hardest part, my dear. It will get better. But also, it is okay to be a mess right now.

I also lost my first pregnancy back in April at around the 9/10w mark, and we have been trying ever since it was safe to post-surgery.  As a fellow Type A and super-impatient individual, I totally understand how it feels to zoom into each and every data point and obsess about it until you have a new one to look at.  Last cycle (number 3) was an absolute shit-show, and the lowest I have felt since the loss - maybe even lower.

However, I want to give you hope that things will get better.  I don't know if I had to hit the absolute bottom to make myself feel that the only way was up, and realise that making myself stress out about things that are essentially beyond my control wasn't going to help, but this cycle has been a million times better, and I feel I've had some sort of a breakthrough.  It's honestly like night and day.

I've also found myself (I honestly don't know how this happened...!) adopting a 'it will happen when it does' mentality because we all know that we can only max our chances up to a certain point each cycle, and the rest is just a dice roll.  My period is due this Thursday coming and right now I feel at peace with if it shows up.

I also use OPKs and this will be my second cycle temping post loss (gave myself a break for the first two), although I also find it a little stressful (mainly because I find it disrupts my sleep a bit).  With this current cycle I have found myself being a lot more zen about things - I just take my temp when I happen to wake up, and don't stress if it isn't when I 'should have'.

What helps me is to remind myself that all of these things just provide **information** \- they are **not guarantees or sureties that anything will or won't happen**.  The prettiest most perfect chart doesn't equal pregnancy, and I'm sure there are plenty of bizarre looking charts, or people who weren't able to 100% confirm their ovulation for whom it did!  Most importantly, millions of women all around the world are getting pregnant *without* using any of these methods!

If you find the information gathering is causing you undue stress, then consider whether it would help you to stop or cut down on what you're collecting.  If you are a healthy individual, with no suggestion that there is anything wrong with your fertility (sorry to trot out this old chestnut, but it's very unlikely seeing as you were able to get pregnant before) then knowing or not knowing things will not, and does not, have an impact on your potential success (provided you are having sex at the right times which you clearly are - see last para).  I also would really encourage you to not focus on the heart-rate information that you mentioned - I don't think there are any studies that correlate any sort of tracking methods to indication of MC, and I definitely know that it is strongly recommended that you stop temping once you get a positive because there is no point to collecting the info any more.

What I would say is this - if you roughly know your cycle, and you are confident that you are ovulating (very *very* likely because of your previous circumstances), then there really isn't any need to confirm to do anything more.  It's very obvious, but all getting pregnant really needs (barring any health conditions) is regular sex.  If you are having sex at least two or three times a week (or focused around your FW if you prefer), then you have given yourself the best shot you can for that cycle.  If you and your partner are healthy, then everything else is just set-dressing and personal reassurance.

These are the two courses I did, however I really encourage you to do your own search for 'free self-help', 'free CBT'.

I&#39;m very sure that your sensitivity to triggers will get less over time; I&#39;ve definitely noticed mine have.  At the beginning I don&#39;t think I could have coped <em>at all</em> with seeing a pregnant woman, but just last week I happened to see a very far on one, and had no reaction.  That really made me feel like things had improved.</p>

<p>These are the two courses I did, however I really encourage you to do your own search for &#39;free self-help&#39;, &#39;free CBT&#39;.  I think the eCouch one might be good for you initially as it takes you through a questionnaire to figure out where your low mood is coming from (i.e. is it anxiety related, depression?).</p>

So, in a way I guess I'm lucky. I'm an engineer and I've been working from home since mid-March with no end in sight. I can do my job 100% from home. So from that end, I don't have to put on a smiling face for strangers or coworkers. If I'm close enough with a coworker and they ask me how I am, I am 100% honest with them. Shitty.

The good thing about being at home is that most of our interactions are done via text chat so I think that helps me be a little more honest too, and I can cry all I want behind my computer screen because my spreadsheets won't judge me. 

You can ask my husband - I definitely don't put on a happy face at home with him (thank goodness for him) and even with his family. His sister had 2 MMC's as well and 2 LC's and when she visited this weekend we talked about the MC's and I cried a bunch.

Honestly I've never been one to pretend to be ok when I'm not so I may not be the best person to give advice on this, haha. I just never had the time or energy to pretend to be fine when I felt like I was falling apart inside.

I bit the bullet and called my old RE to see whether he would want to see me.

I think what you describe is very normal after a traumatic event.

Personally after my loss in April I found I was somehow able to get through the first couple of cycles by focusing on the positive (i.e. waiting for my period to come back...it came!, first 'proper' cycle after MC...will this be the one?) but then going into cycle 3, everything just hit the fan.  It was honestly awful - I was tearful, distracted and angry nearly every day for about three weeks.

I'm still not sure if it's because there was nothing more 'positive' I could focus on to block out the anxiety, I hadn't properly processed my grief/upset at the loss (we conceived on cycle 3 first time) or it was an explosion of my fear and worry that we would not be able to get pregnant again.

I'm afraid I don't have a magic bullet to fix how you're feeling, but I did talk to anyone who would listen during that time and found that each time I shared my story, it would lighten my load a little.  I didn't do anything special, but I did start feeling a lot better after I moved into cycle 4 - it was like the pressure dissapated once my period arrived.

If it works for you, I would really recommend self-help like CBT (there are lots of free programs online, lmk if you need linking) or if you can get therapy/counselling through work, that might help.  Personally I just needed someone to talk at, even ended up ringing the Samaritans some days.

I also just tried to keep myself busy - even though I would still be crying, it helped to have stuff to 'make the day go by'.  Scheduling in exercise, when I would eat lunch, a work task.  These things also helped a little.

I'd recommend as well 'rewarding' yourself or setting up something nice on the day you expect your period - that way you have something to set your sights on/focus on that is good during the time you're finding stressful.

I'm in an identical position to you atm, 5DPO and period due next Thursday.  The worst part of the cycle for me is the TWW, and right now, I can feel my anxiety ramping up somewhat, but I'm no *way* as bad as I was last month if that's helpful to you.

I don't know where I heard about the lining after a D&C being an issue, the drs might have also said that or I might have right it somewhere else, but I know I have heard that, it also just makes sense to me.

Anecdotally... I had a D&C in early March. Since then my cycles have been longer and my periods lighter, shorter and there still seems to be very small amounts of tissue. Everything I read said that was normal. We conceived again in June (3rd cycle since the d&c) and believe it was a chemical pregnancy, the embryo didn't implant. I saw some comments on here that if your body isn't ready to be pregnant it just won't get pregnant, but I don't know if that's exactly the case. I think you can conceive and not have implantation, I think that's what happened to me. Honestly, even seeing the positive pregnancy test to a few days later heavy bleeding and confirming with drs that it was technically a second miscarriage, was AWFUL.

I'm not sure what I'm going to do now. In my gut, I feel like my lining never healed and that's why this pregnancy didn't stick.

I don&#39;t know where I heard about the lining after a D&amp;C being an issue, the drs might have also said that or I might have right it somewhere else, but I know I have heard that, it also just makes sense to me.</p>

<p>Anecdotally... I had a D&amp;C in early March. Since then my cycles have been longer and my periods lighter, shorter and there still seems to be very small amounts of tissue. Everything I read said that was normal. We conceived again in June (3rd cycle since the d&amp;c) and believe it was a chemical pregnancy, the embryo didn&#39;t implant. I saw some comments on here that if your body isn&#39;t ready to be pregnant it just won&#39;t get pregnant, but I don&#39;t know if that&#39;s exactly the case. I think you can conceive and not have implantation, I think that&#39;s what happened to me. Honestly, even seeing the positive pregnancy test to a few days later heavy bleeding and confirming with drs that it was technically a second miscarriage, was AWFUL.</p>

You did not cause it from your sleeping position.

Something terrible happened *to you* not *because of you*.

For evidence, please check out this link about sleeping position not being correlated to pregnancy outcome. It talks about the issue with earlier studies, which basically that people over-report ""bad"" behaviors if they had a bad outcome, and people who have good outcomes under-report their ""bad"" behaviors, because they just don't stick out in their memory. If everything had gone perfectly, I am willing to guess that you would not remember that one time you slept funny.

And in Emily Oster's book, she goes into sleeping on your back and that you would wake up due to lack of oxygen before there was ever any harm to the baby. Please stop haraunging yourself for something that is not your fault.

<p>The doctors office told me for dating and timing purposes to wait until I get my next period to start again, but followed it up with there‚Äôs no medical reason to not try immediately after, it would be fine if I got pregnant this cycle. They advised me to continue with the prenatals, and that‚Äôs pretty much it. I imagine they might say that to the general population who isn‚Äôt so aware of their schedule/cycle like we are. That‚Äôs just what they told me.

Bleeding stopped completely around CD7-8

Firstly, I am so sorry for your losses. It is completely understandable you feel how you do after all you have been through and you are absolutely NOT a failure.

I would highly recommend looking into cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT). After 2 years of TTC, 2 MCs and then the full-term stillbirth of my son, I still tried to remain positive through the grief about having a living child. But the next 2.5 years only brought a diagnosis of unexplained infertility and 4 more MCs. I spiralled further into depression and my anxiety took over every waking moment. I left my job, cut myself off from friends and family and barely left the house. I couldn't see a way forwards and my marriage was suffering. I started CBT sessions last year in the hopes of returning to work at least. It wasn't a magical fix-all of course, but I do feel that it really helped me to manage my anxiety and start to get my life back - I reconnected with people, started a new job and learnt techniques that eventually helped me navigate my worries and feelings through my 8th pregnancy (success).

I couldn't possibly summarise everything, but here are some of the things I personally found the most helpful: 1. Having a set of questions ready to challenge my line of thinking with. So, for example, I might ask myself if I can stop myself from having a MC? Most likely no. I CAN make sure I attend my appointments, not drink alcohol, take the folic acid, aspirin, progesterone and vit D I've been advised to etc. I CAN'T control if I miscarry or not, therefore worrying about it is unhelpful to me and a waste of my time and energy. Now, I'm not saying all the worries disappeared but talking it through in my head would usually stop me from spiralling by realising it was the anxiety talking, not me. What worries you most about leaving the house? I might see someone I know and have to have an awkward conversation with them about how I'm doing since my baby died. Is it likely? No, most people will be at work at this time. Can you control if you see someone you know? No. What can I do about it? I can have some planned things to say ready in my head so I don't panic. I will say I'm having good days and bad days, thanks for asking, ask how they are and then say I need to dash and make an excuse to leave. And so on. 

2. When feeling especially anxious it helped to have distraction techniques to diffuse the situation. One was to pick a song and try to remember all the lyrics. Another was to go through the alphabet thinking of something for each letter e.g. animals, countries, bands.

3. I also practise a lot of mindfulness techniques now - I would recommend this even if you don't think CBT is for you. It could be anything from taking a walk in nature and taking in all the sights, sounds, smells and feelings, to doing an activity that is relaxing and requires a level of focus.

<p>Firstly, I am so sorry for your losses. It is completely understandable you feel how you do after all you have been through and you are absolutely NOT a failure.</p>

<p>I would highly recommend looking into cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT). After 2 years of TTC, 2 MCs and then the full-term stillbirth of my son, I still tried to remain positive through the grief about having a living child. But the next 2.5 years only brought a diagnosis of unexplained infertility and 4 more MCs. I spiralled further into depression and my anxiety took over every waking moment. I left my job, cut myself off from friends and family and barely left the house. I couldn&#39;t see a way forwards and my marriage was suffering. I started CBT sessions last year in the hopes of returning to work at least. It wasn&#39;t a magical fix-all of course, but I do feel that it really helped me to manage my anxiety and start to get my life back - I reconnected with people, started a new job and learnt techniques that eventually helped me navigate my worries and feelings through my 8th pregnancy (success).</p>

<p>I couldn&#39;t possibly summarise everything, but here are some of the things I personally found the most helpful: 1. Having a set of questions ready to challenge my line of thinking with. So, for example, I might ask myself if I can stop myself from having a MC? Most likely no. I CAN make sure I attend my appointments, not drink alcohol, take the folic acid, aspirin, progesterone and vit D I&#39;ve been advised to etc. I CAN&#39;T control if I miscarry or not, therefore worrying about it is unhelpful to me and a waste of my time and energy. Now, I&#39;m not saying all the worries disappeared but talking it through in my head would usually stop me from spiralling by realising it was the anxiety talking, not me. What worries you most about leaving the house? I might see someone I know and have to have an awkward conversation with them about how I&#39;m doing since my baby died. Is it likely? No, most people will be at work at this time. Can you control if you see someone you know? No. What can I do about it? I can have some planned things to say ready in my head so I don&#39;t panic. I will say I&#39;m having good days and bad days, thanks for asking, ask how they are and then say I need to dash and make an excuse to leave. And so on. </p>

Just to be clear, the above advice is for first and early second trimester MCs - which is what I believe the majority of ladies in this sub will have experienced.  

As such, if you are in this category, and want to start TTC immediately after a D&C, and you have not been given explicit medical reasoning as to why you shouldn't (you suffered trauma from the surgery, they discovered something which requires further exploration etc) then there is nothing stopping you from *trying* as soon as you want to.

If there *are* any issues with uterine lining, then it most likely will mean that the cycle will just not result in a pregnancy, vs. there being an inherent risk to it!  If your body is not capable of getting pregnant, then it will not happen, but there's no reason to tell people not to try!

I know people mean well, but I was also told by a midwife that I'd be ""more fertile in the first few months"" after the MC, which also is a well-known myth.

It is best to wait until any bleeding from the MC has completely stopped, and to give yourself around a fortnight from the MC event to ensure your cervix has fully closed/recovered to prevent infection, but it's very possible to 'catch' the first ovulation after a MC and be successful without having another period.

If you do want to jump in straightaway, I noted that you said you are still getting a clear positive on a HPT and your beta is at 1000.  Ovulation (and any subsequent period) will not arrive until your HCG has dropped to a certain level (exact figures vary from person to person, but in general, a HPT should be negative or very faint, i.e. in the low double digits).  The time it takes for HCG to drop also varies from person to person.

If you are tracking down with HPTs, then you can switch over to OPKs once the line starts to get fainter if you want to see when you are likely to ovulate.  Be aware that using OPKs whilst you still have HCG in your system can lead to false positives.  

It's also very possible and normal for a first cycle after a loss to be anovulatory, so do not let that concern you if you don't see any clear trends this time.

<p>Each method (OPKs, cervical position, cervical mucus, temping...) can only let you know whether your body appears to be doing <em>some</em> of the things that are required to lead to pregnancy (hormonal shift which leads to ovulation etc).  Having this knowledge can allow you to have a somewhat better chance each cycle by being more aware of your FW and when/whether you are ovulating, but that&#39;s it.  There are no tracking methods that can be used after ovulation has been confirmed (it&#39;s just the wait for a positive or your period), and whether a fertilised egg implants or not is hugely up to chance.</p>

<p>As other posters have said, there are many many people all over the world, every day, that get pregnant without any sort of awareness of their cycles, and just happened to have sex at the right time.  If you are having regular sex, whether tracking or not, then you are giving yourself a good shot each cycle.</p>

And also the fact that there is no one else to carry on my family, as I‚Äôm an only child... and I want a child so bad that I honestly don‚Äôt even have the words to describe my emotions on it...
One thing I have found that truly has helped is getting on an antidepressant. That has done wonders for me. Same with the hubby.

I‚Äôve told other people I‚Äôm sorry, but have been able to empathize. I have two friends in a group chat we always use, and neither of them are TTC. Once it was final, they literally both said I‚Äôm sorry. With one little variant being one said my name. I had the sort of reaction in my head, because I was emotional, where I was like ‚Äúthat‚Äôs it, that‚Äôs all they‚Äôre gonna say?‚Äù But at the same time, I don‚Äôt think they literally have any idea what to say. They have never went through it. They don‚Äôt understand. They understand it‚Äôs a sad thing, but no one truly understands until they go through it. I now appreciate that they truly just say ‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry‚Äù and not try and offer a silver lining or advice unwarranted. That‚Äôs been my job to offer silver linings to myself, somehow when it comes from someone who hasn‚Äôt experienced a miscarriage, it can sting. </p>

<p>I hate that I went through it, absolutely gutted me. And my husband. But, at the same time, it has given me greater understanding and being able to empathize with others going through the grief. I have a career where I help people as a physical therapist. But it never usually is isolated to physical. I‚Äôve always sort of been that way in wanting to relate and help people.

I'm going to tell you my story because I had a weird complication. I had an MMC in 2016 at 6 weeks (two rounds of Misoprostol), LC via cesarean in 2017, and an MMC in 2019 at 10 weeks. My last MMC was complicated. I found out I was bleeding in a Monday and confirmed MMC. I opted for a D&C but wasn't able to get it until Wednesday. On Tuesday, I started cramping/labor. It was over three hours of terrible contractions. I ended up in the ER and finally started passing tissue. Unfortunately, it was incomplete and I required a D&C two weeks later. After the D&C, I ended up with weird bleeding after my periods that would last for weeks and was eventually diagnosed with cesarean scar defect (weakness in the scar) that required surgery to repair. If you are experiencing repeat pregnancy loss after a cesarean, you may want to get this checked by someone who knows what they're looking at. Mine wasn't diagnosed until I got a full fertility workup with an RE. It might be a long shot, but I had never heard if this complication and want women to know about it just in case.

To actually answer your question, for me, it really would depend on how far along I am. A six-week miscarriage is far different from a ten-week. Passing tissue at ten weeks was horrifying to me. Considering my complications, I would consult my surgeon before deciding, but that's generally my take.

I had a difficult pregnancy with HG (lost over 15 pounds) and severe anxiety/panic attacks as I was told to off my medications.

I had a D&E but ended up with heavy bleeding and clots.  My uterus was so big from the multiples that it wasn't contracting or expelling the blood clots.  I needed an emergency D&C and blood transfusion.  Recovery was painful as I had to take 2 rounds of meds to force my uterus ro contact back down.

Did you notice your tolerance for alcohol changed after your loss? 

I got my period a few days ago (yay for normal cycles!) and my partner and I decided to put off trying for a month to relax and enjoying a vacation that will involved a lot of wine drinking and hot tubing. 

Because of this, I‚Äôm back to relaxing with a drink after work with my partner (beer drinker). When we decided to put off trying he went out and got me a few bottles of my favorite bubbles, ros√® and red wine.  Yesterday I tried to have a glass of bubbles, and half way through the glass I didn‚Äôt really want anymore. My body was just like, no more. 

This is weird since I used to love enjoying a glass of wine, and trying new kinds. Wine is one of my hobbies. Now, I‚Äôm just not really that interested. My partner also offered to shake me up a martini (my favorite cocktail) and the thought of drinking that was almost repulsive.

My understanding with the chemical especially since it was such a quick chemical for me and you. Is that there shouldn&#39;t be any reason not to try again. But it&#39;s all a personal decision. Like the 24h I was pregnant this time. I was soooo anxious about seeing blood. Everytime I went to the bathroom I was looking for blood. And unfortunately it happened. So I&#39;m not sure how I&#39;m going I&#39;m feel the next time I&#39;m pregnant. </p>

For me, the thing that's helped to distract me from being so fixated is health and wellness. I'm slightly overweight and used quarantine as an excuse to be lazy but not anymore. My pregnancy loss has kickstarted my desire to be as healthy as I can be for my future baby. I know this doesn't work for everyone but this has been a godsend during these trying times. And I'm especially motivated because once I get pregnant I shouldn't be actively seeking weight loss so in a way I am both rushing to get pregnant but am rushing to lose as many pounds in a healthy way as I can. A failed cycle is another month to keep losing.

Another thing I've been working on is working on house projects. There are a number of things that need to be accomplished around the house, small things that take 1-3 days, and it's been so rewarding tackling those projects finally since I have all this anxious energy that needs to be burned through.

If you can't find an activity or goal to work towards, I'd say try mindfulness meditation. Mindfulness helps anxiety and focus a lot because it keeps you present and teaches you coping mechanisms for how to handle not being in control of the future.

I do agree with you that DNA fragmentation knowledge has only recently gotten a bit more mainstream and from what I hear, many clinics here in the US and in Europe still won't look into it unless specifically asked. 
So a huge part of my medical studies consists of genetics, which is also the area I am most passionate about, besides Public health and public policies in healthcare. I came across DNA fragmentation in sperm a couple of years ago just as I was browsing some new research articles and it sort of stuck in the back of my head.
When I had the ectopic, I KNEW it wasn't due to my tubes and that there MUST be another reason and science just hasn't found it yet. 
Well it turns out science has found some evidence that DNA fragmentation causes ectopics (and recurrent loss) and I can only assume that because a.) This is a women's health and fertility problem and it's not super sexy and b.) It's an issue on the male side and God forbid we stop blaming women for everything, and c) many currently practicing physicians studied well over 20, 30 years ago using text books that were written 25-35 years ago using data that is essentially from the 1960ies, so their fertility knowledge may not be up to date.
Fertility is not a survival aspect of medicine and hence it is not paid much attention to. This is why it's more patient driven rather than doctor driven and practices will progress faster if the patients start speaking up and asking for things and information.
ANYWAY to answer your question: 
Your standard semen analysis will most likely look normal. Your embryos (if doing IVF or post loss testing) will most likely be normal. These tests do not pick up DNA fragmentation. That is a separate test you need to ask for IN ADDITION TO SEMEN ANALYSIS. Especially if you have a recurrent loss.
With DNA fragmentation, conception will be normal, you'll get pregnant no problem but you'll keep having miscarriages with seemingly normal embryos. 
There is lot of evidence supporting that, look at r/dnafragmentation for more info on that.
It's also something you can actually improve, so it's good to know if that is an issue for your husband. It could be the solution to your recurrent loss! 

I would go to your RE and say: in light of the recurrent losses and my clear ability to get pregnant, I want my husband's sperm tested for DNA fragmentation. Is this something you can do here or do I need to go somewhere else? 
Or you can just say, I want my husband's sperm tested for DNA fragmentation, where is the best place to go and do that 
If your husband has a reproductive urologist (many regular urologists may not know how to do that test), that doctor is likely to know about this test also. 

Lastly, if your RE gives you attitude and acts condescending and demeaning, f*em and move on to someone else.

On the day I took the Misoprostol, we got a bunch of food that was easy to make, comfort snacks - tons of ice cream, made a list of movies to watch and just attempted to make it a really cozy day trying to mitigate some of the dread hanging overhead of what was coming. You're definitely going to want some pads. I remember texting a friend of mine, ""What do you wear when you know you're about to have a miscarriage?"" I opted for chilling in my (heavily padded) underwear for the day. I would highly recommend if at all possible having someone sort of on call to help you if it starts before Sunday - if only to be an emotional support. It's an intense experience.

TW: what we did the remains

So, my husband built a wooden box which was actually really cathartic for him for us to catch the remains. I didn't feel right about flushing everything and also (logistically) was concerned some of the clots might be too big to flush, and I really didn't want to deal with a toilet disaster in the midst of everything. We have a Christmas tree burning party every year for my birthday in early January, and we burned the box along with all the trees our friends brought. Some close friends knew about the box but most guests didn't. We do this annually and invite our friends to bring anything they would like to burn that they don't want to bring into the new year, so it's a symbolic event for us anyway. For me, it felt really healing to have a ceremony of sorts surrounded by loving friends to say goodbye with my husband to the hope for that pregnancy, but also to feel prepared to move forward and look forward to a hopeful future. Just my personality or taste or whatever, having some sort of ritual or ceremony feels important, but I totally understand that it's not for everyone.

This is already super long, but I'm so sorry you're going through this. The waiting is awful.

These are physical exercises that help your nervous system process the physiological effects of trauma on your body. It involves no talk therapy, it is purely physical. I found it helpful then, and have booked myself in for a session. The science does back up that having more physical control over your nervous system benefits blood pressure, heart rate etc. etc.

I have all the mental tools, I am doing the right things, I am participating in support groups etc. but I still feel completely disconnected from my own body and find myself often feeling very much in a state of fight or flight mode.</p>

<p>However, I&#39;m not sure why I didn&#39;t think about it, but reading through her stuff reminded me of something I used to help process some trauma unrelated to infertility/pregnancy etc. which is trauma release exercises. These are physical exercises that help your nervous system process the physiological effects of trauma on your body. It involves no talk therapy, it is purely physical. I found it helpful then, and have booked myself in for a session. The science does back up that having more physical control over your nervous system benefits blood pressure, heart rate etc. etc. </p>

<p>From what I understand of Deshpande&#39;s work, her focus is on similar things, the physiological, not the mental. </p>

<p>So I am going to be pursuing that path more with practitioners near me.</p>

<p>I thankfully did get disability coverage when I started two years ago. I never had it before because I was never in a full time job or one that paid enough. </p>

<p>I have worked myself up over the last few weeks, even seriously considering quitting my job. But a few people talked me off the ledge, but this helps to have even more knowledge. I was even reading today that some states can take away your certification if you breach your contract. We don&#39;t have a teacher&#39;s union where I am in south carolina. I kinda wish I did now, I had one when I was a teacher in Connecticut. Ugh we have to fight harder to have the children we want and now to keep them and us safe in this crazy stinking time!

And honestly, I wouldn't be surprised if the research ultimately says that there isn't a big interaction between COVID and pregnancy at any stage.

<p>Sorry for writing a novel, but I am sharing in hopes this is in any way helpful for you. I&#39;m very sorry for your loss. Even without insurance, you can get levothyroxine for $4 a month from Walmart pharmacies.</p>

I think there are a couple of approaches you can take to this:

1. **Just ensure you are having sex at least two to three times a week** \- this method requires no tracking whatsoever, and you are more than likely to get at least one day within your FW as sperm can live for up to five days internally (they ideally need to be in there *before* ovulation). It doesn't need to be EOD as you could do it on Monday, Thursday and Sunday for example.  People get pregnant all the time without tracking.

2a. **Start tracking your ovulation and let your husband know you are doing this** \- this allows you to really narrow in on your FW and then you can choose how often you want to have sex during that time.  I highly recommend using Clearblue Advanced Digital (CBAD) kits as they give you several days' alert in advance to when your ovulation is likely to happen.  That way you can really focus your efforts on just a few days, and completely relax for the rest of the month (this is what my husband and I do).

2b. **Start tracking your ovulation and do it by yourself** \- if you think your husband is going to get stressed knowing that he *needs* to perform because you are a few days out from ovulation, then you might just not want to tell him, but just rather incorporate this method into a sort of heads up approach like ""We're going to have sex a few times this week"".  You will of course know the days it is best for this to happen, but it might take some of the pressure off him.

A general tip - pregnancy sex does not need to be the best sex of your life - you just need the sperm to get in you.  Is there a possibility that he can get himself up to 'the edge' via another way and then just finish in you?

I know how exhausting and heart-rending it can be as the cycle my husband I got pregnant with our loss was awful; we were just sick and tired of it all!  I have to say we are so much better post-loss and it is very easy for us now, although obviously I do wish we weren't still trying.

About how alone we are in this. </p>

<p>And then he felt like shit, went ghost white and silent.  He felt so bad. And now I feel bad for making him feel bad by crying :-/</p>

<p>They&#39;re great people. I am not upset. I&#39;m just still too sensitive for that kind of joke.</p>

I would ask your doctor or OB for blood work and more information as to what you can do to prepare for another pregnancy and have the best outcome. See if they can recommend brands to buy for vitamins/supplements and if there is any testing you can have done.

With that being said, with our TFMR I have to take into account the fact that her gene mutation was probably a fluke and nothing I could've done would've changed the outcome.
