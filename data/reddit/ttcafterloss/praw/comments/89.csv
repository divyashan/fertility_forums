I actually had my uterus perforated during a D&C. It was the second one, and I had had a partial molar pregnancy.

If your uterus or cervix were injured, your surgeon would have told you. They would have given you specific instructions not to get pregnant or even have sex for a specific amount of time.

Not my proudest moment, but I want to let you know pain and grief can be consuming and we never know what it&#39;s truly doing to us and if we don&#39;t have someone to talk to (professionally) or good coping mechanisms that it can be unfortunately directed at the ones who are undeserving of our frustration. Forgive yourself as much as you can as often as you can , these are circumstances beyond our control and we can only do so much to navigate through them with doctor visits, medication, research and bookkeeping. I cringe with every cramp, every period, every negative pregnancy test it&#39;s a reminder of what was lost and what I may not ever achieve but I allow myself a little hope, a little forgiveness with every passing negative thought. Wishing you and your husband all the best.</p>

I lost one pregnancy, and I felt like I’d never be happy to be pregnant again, but when I fell pregnant 6 months later, it was still exciting and magical, I was just much much more anxious and waiting for it to go wrong again, which sadly it did

After that I felt like I’d never be excited again and for months while I waited for my period to arrive I just thought “I’m going to be heartbroken whether my period comes or not”, and I couldn’t see a light at the end of the tunnel and just felt like any subsequent pregnancy would end up the same, that I was doomed to repeat the same cycle.

I wish the end of this story was as hopeful as “and now I have a healthy baby”.

I think you’re bound to be much more anxious in any future pregnancy, and yes, you have so cruelly been robbed of that excitement that comes the first time round, but once you’ve had time to grieve, you can still have an exciting and happy pregnancy. Your loss is still so recent and raw, you have to give yourself time to process this loss, and allow yourself to grieve.

It’s not quite as optimistic as that I’m afraid, but now (10 months on), I’m finally starting to feel excited by the prospect again, I’m in the 2 week wait following our first IUI, and I’m actually feeling hopeful that it could work out, and I never thought I’d feel that way again.</p>

<p>I think you’re bound to be much more anxious in any future pregnancy, and yes, you have so cruelly been robbed of that excitement that comes the first time round, but once you’ve had time to grieve, you can still have an exciting and happy pregnancy. Your loss is still so recent and raw, you have to give yourself time to process this loss, and allow yourself to grieve. Don’t let anyone try to minimise what you’ve been through or make you feel like you’re wrong to feel anything that you feel. What’s happened to you is cruel and unfair and painful, but just try to remember, there is a light at the end of the tunnel.</p>

I started trying at least 8 months before them, had one miscarriage and ....nothing. And it hurts. We are the same age (my sister in law and I) and I bought she might struggle to but —— first month or so of trying. Just trying to process so I can only show them my joy when I see them in person</p>

My ray of sunshine in this situation is that even in the absence of a positive this cycle, I would love at least a full LP as an indicator of progress towards that goal.</p>

I went down the rabbithole of tracking, temping, and obsessing about my cycle too at first. I downloaded a million apps, considered buying testing kits for ovulation... I soon realized I was not helping myself with tjis obsession and overstressing. Your doctor might advise you to wait one cycle, three, six or even none. I got four different opinions but stuck with the doctor who only proposed one cycle wait. Research shows we're very fertile three months post MC, so I wasn't gonna kick the chances. Plus from my research, no hard data (from extensive and large sample research) exist indicating waiting for more than one cycle results in better chances for a successful pregnancy. My current doc confirmed this. 

All in all my advise is, don't stress it. Or at least try not to. Try to keep the reins on yourself when you start going down the rabbithole. 

I ended up deleting everything but the Flo app (for regular period tracking) and simply had sex daily two days after my last day of period till five days before my next one. If you have sex daily or every other day you have good chances. It's certain you'll have alive sperm inside you when that egg gets released. What happens next is out of out hands. This outlook had greatly helped me. I do have my down and stressed out days but I keep repeating to myself these facts and it helps. 

I wish you all the best in TTC and on your future pregnancy! 

Feel free to message me whenever. The support i received in this group is what kept me going throughout this hellish process of loss, grieving, coping, and trying again.

I expressed my concerns to the doctor who performed the D&amp;C and she was wholly unconcerned, even after my RE suggested she do a 3D ultrasound. </p>

<p>Finally in DECEMBER my HCG went low enough that we could move forward. Went for a saline sonogram to confirm nothing was left hanging around. Of COURSE something was found. I was then referred to another doctor for a hysteroscopy where a decent size mass of tissue was found. I was so upset. I still am. </p>

<p>Hang in there. I am sorry you&#39;re going through this. None of this BS is fair. And yes, WHY IS ULTRASOUND GUIDED D&amp;C NOT THE STANDARD?!</p>

I’m past the point of confusion, I'm just frustrated now. I've got various different responses from each doctor I've spoken to throughout this journey (MMC 8 weeks):

**OB #1:** Pre-conception visit - he said my TSH levels should be within the standard range (<2.5) or else the fetus has development issues, low IQ. He didn't bring up the possibility of miscarriages, only that it could be a risk. I started levothyroxine 25mg after the visit. My TSH was at 3.3 at the time. 

**OB #2:** Early pregnancy - she asked me why I was taking levothyroxine in the first place, since my T3 and T4 levels are normal (meaning my body is getting the right amounts of TSH, but I'm just producing more of it). I told her because I felt like utter crap with high TSH and because my previous OB told me I should get it within range. She wasn't concerned about doing bloodwork immediately. I only did standard bloodwork for first trimester. My TSH was 4.4 at the time.

**Emergency room doctor:** During miscarriage - I asked him if my thyroid levels contributed to the MMC. He said no, because my T3 and T4 levels were fine. He also said it was very controversial that I should be treated for this. In my state of complete misery, I can only think WTF?!

**OB #3 (Fertility specialist):** She ordered labs and my TSH was at 10.8. I asked if this would affect my chances of conceiving this cycle. She told me I need to put a complete hold off TTC until my levels are within range and until I start treatment, and that levels this high can lead to a miscarriage. So fuck. Me.

I’ve ovulated regularly throughout my life even with TSH levels as high as 18. I was able to get pregnant on my 2nd cycle of trying. My TSH levels tend to fluctuate because of my TBO Abs (thyroid anti-bodies). 

So what I can tell you is this - new research is just being published on the thyroid's connection to miscarriages, and doctors seem to be indifferent at the moment. I want to trust OB #3 (the fertility specialist) so bad, but it makes me very anxious to constantly think about my TSH levels causing my past miscarriage and potential future ones too.

<p>I’ve also been feeling super out of wack and besides my late period, I haven’t been able to pinpoint when I was about to ovulate (mind you I don’t temps I just use OPKs) but the OPKs always seemed to be ‘’stuck’’ at a certain color without darkening if that makes any sense. I also just overall felt ‘’meh’’ for some reason.</p>

as far as the healing process, that’s really something that will be personal to you. i can tell you for me, i had PTSD and went to therapy for a year, i took a month off work and another month at part time. i went through the stages of grief and around 10 months out i started to notice the sharp pain that i felt everyday was a little less sharp, i was a little less sad. which of course made me even more sad because i realized i was moving on. but it’s normal. it’s okay. it took a few more months before i was okay with the fact that i was getting better. i got pregnant 13 months after we lost our first son. it helped me heal and took my mind off our loss. my 4 year old by no means replaced my first son, i think about him often and what he would be like, i honor him every year and i always will.

I wanted to also talk about one of your con points. Don't feel guilty about trying again. Trying again doesn't in any way invalidates the love you had for your lost baby, nor does it disrespect its memory.

Those two reasons were enough for us. </p>

<p>I wanted to also talk about one of your con points. Don&#39;t feel guilty about trying again. Trying again doesn&#39;t in any way invalidates the love you had for your lost baby, nor does it disrespect its memory.

We learnt that I had a MMC on Jan 13. I grieved quite a bit at first and felt relatively normal after returning to work. I felt downright happy this past weekend when I realized my bleeding had finally stopped, but yesterday and today have been rough.

I have been dealing with infertility since my MMC in June.  After numerous doctors visits and a full workup at a fertility clinic, I believe we found the source of my infertility and odd bleeding.  I have a ""Cesarean scar defect,"" which means that the scar in my uterus opened up.  It actually isn't safe for me to get pregnant in this state.

I feel unsettled after finding this out.  On the one hand, this is good news.  We have an answer!  It's fixable!  On the other hand, my surgery is over a month out and it will require 2-4 months of recovery before trying again, so I can't try until May-July of this year.  I've been TTC since December 2018.  It feels like it has been so long (I know that others have been TTC for longer, but this does feel like a long time).

Lately, I feel myself missing my baby.  I was due in early January.  It was excruciating to pass my due date.  I never want to do that again.  My SIL is going in for a Cesarean tomorrow to have her #3.  One of my best friends who has been TTC since around the same time is going in for an egg transfer tomorrow.  One of my good friends who took so long to find the right guy, got married and pregnant all since I lost my baby.    I'm not one of those women who handles things gracefully.  I'm jealous.  I don't know what to do with myself until I can try again.

I don't know what I'm asking for here.  I think I just needed to tell someone who might understand.  My friends and husband have been really understanding and great, but I feel like a shell right now.

I've been very open about my pregnancies and my miscarriages. Probably a dozen of my close friends know about it (in pretty raw detail) as do my parents, brother and parents in law. My husband has also started telling more and more people.

For me the last barrier really was people at work. Obviously as a woman you don't necessarily want to confirm to your boss that you're trying to have a baby. So I kept my first two losses hidden.

This time I decided to tell my bosses what was going on from the beginning. I figured that I'm nearly 34 and got married last year, they're not stupid, they know I'm almost certainly trying for a baby, and I decided I had more to gain from their support than I did to lose by confirming I was trying. Obviously whether this approach works for you will depend on your boss and what relationship you have with them, so YMMV. Since then I've told quite a few people at work, people I trust to be discreet about it.

I don’t know what will help you since we all deal with and experience the grief differently but try to just focus on getting through the now. Make sure your body is getting the nutrition it needs (iron rich foods, lentils etc) and the rest it needs (I couldn’t believe how much I needed, ended up staying home from work the whole week). Hopefully your OB gave you some advice on what to look out for and what things can help. 

I had anxiety during the MC process about what to expect and what was normal so I read a ton of blogs/articles about various women’s experiences miscarrying at home. Might be wrong for you, but reading other people’s experiences helped me to not feel as alone during a really lonely process and feel like I knew what to potentially expect.

Try to breath deep and just focus on taking care of yourself and getting through this. I remember how awful it felt to be bleeding and seeing and knowing it was me losing the pregnancy. I don’t know what will help you since we all deal with and experience the grief differently but try to just focus on getting through the now. Make sure your body is getting the nutrition it needs (iron rich foods, lentils etc) and the rest it needs (I couldn’t believe how much I needed, ended up staying home from work the whole week). Hopefully your OB gave you some advice on what to look out for and what things can help. </p>

<p>I had anxiety during the MC process about what to expect and what was normal so I read a ton of blogs/articles about various women’s experiences miscarrying at home. Might be wrong for you, but reading other people’s experiences helped me to not feel as alone during a really lonely process and feel like I knew what to potentially expect.

I have started tracking my bbt and it dropped slightly today, I know it varies but I&#39;m trying to remain hopeful that my body is finally starting to regulate itself into a shorter cycle and ovulating sooner.</p>

The fact that you're at the point of trying to conceive again is great. Try to draw some positivity put of this. 

Truth is we can't be sure when we're gonna conceive. No matter how much you test or not, or if you have sex at the perfect moment pr daily during your fertile window, it still doesn't guarantee that you'll get pregnant. 

That being said, having sex daily or day after day during most of your cycle and during the fertile week is the best way for positive results. In my experience and personal opinion, testing and overstressing about ovulation and perfect timing doesn't help AT ALL. I'd suggest to focus on gaining pleasure in the process and intimacy of 
having sex and try to have it daily or every second day after your period till your next period. That way it's completely sure you're gonna have live sperm in you no matter when you ovulate. Late, on time, early... Since you have swimmers in, they're gonna try to penetrate the egg and hopefully conception will happen. 

For us, this method has taken off the stress and worrying of the process. We're having a good time and the nights we're tired or not that much in a mood we either go for foreplay and see if we can get in the mood, or simply take a day off and do it the next day. This method worked perfectly and we conceived immediately with our first (the one we lost). We're now in our first cycle of trying and we hope it'll work again. 

I know saying it doesn't make it any easier, but you really need to put stress out of the equation. The more relaxed you are the quicker it'll happen. The more relaxed you are, the more mood you'll have for sex. Not everyone's the same, but this is my two cents and what I've found working. Keep positive and your next pregnancy will come.

However, I took the medical option to manage my miscarriage (not a D&C). I ended up with retained products of conception in my uterus which caused a massive infection (and needed surgery similar to a D&C). But my understanding is that this is much more common with the medication than a D&C. Just based on my experience, I would attend the 6 week follow up to make sure everything is out. They may do an ultrasound, which is how my retained products were discovered. 

I would watch for any fever you get — have it checked out for sure. Again, this is super unlikely, but you just want to play it safe. 

You may not have much in the way of pain or symptoms post D&C. Like i mentioned I had a surgery similar to D&C and had no pain, just loads of bleeding!

I would probably skip temping until you have your first period. I tried to temp after my miscarriage and the graph is ridiculous/ all over the place and told me nothing. Maybe that is because I ended up with a complication, but I’m not sure how useful this data will be for you. 

It was kinda hard to tell when my period started as I literally bled for close to 2 months because of my bizarre complications and infection, but it did end up being quite similar to a normal period. I bled lightly after my surgery, which one day turned into heavy period like bleeding. After that, it ended and I bounced right back into having “normal” cycles for me!

I was also giving a mini pill to take starting in 4 days for 28 days. He seemed to think it was mostly to kick start my cycle and help with dating for a future pregnancy.

I don’t plan to take the mini pill as I don’t handle birth control well (emotional and my blood pressure doesn’t do well). I know these symptoms are lessened with the Mini pill.

Maybe your parents won&#39;t be that person for you, but I hope you can find someone else who understands and supports you how you need it. Regardless, we get it here.</p>
