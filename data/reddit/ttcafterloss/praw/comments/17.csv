My best friend does not know I am pregnant yet. I don't intend to tell her until after their memorial service.

I don't want to lie to her. I'm not hiding it because of my own fears. She's my best friend. I just don't think she should have to process one more emotional thing a week before she buries her son. And I don't want her to have to pretend to be happy when she can't escape. She may be thrilled. She may be way more emotionally mature than I am (likely), but I don't want her to have to work that out before the memorial.

The NP I saw today said she wants us to take a three-month break.

My betas have been as follows:

12/29/15 - 18

1/4/16 - 438

1/6/16 - 1198

When I called yesterday for Wednesday's results, the notes from the doctor said he was really happy with how they're increasing so far, that he wants me in for another draw today (my arms look like I'm a junkie already but that's OK, I'll keep getting poked for this little one!), and that he wants me in for an ultrasound late next week.  We already have an appointment scheduled to see the doctor next Thursday, 1/14/16, at 11:00 so I asked if we could schedule the ultrasound around that time so we didn't have to come in twice.  The nurse had to transfer me to someone in scheduling.  When I requested that with her I got an ""ehhhhh....."" which I understood because it can be *so* damn hard to get timely appointments there sometimes.  She then said, ""Oh my god... there's a 10:20 that someone literally just cancelled.  It's your lucky day!  You need to play the lottery!""  I told her that we don't normally play the lottery but were planning to this time around just because it was so high.  She said, ""Just keep Kimberly in mind and 10% would be fine.""  I thought that was cute.  I've decided since all of my betas have ended in an 8 that that will need to be the last number that I play.  

So, we get to go in next Thursday at 7+1 (I'm still pretty sure I'm earlier than that due to typical O day) to see our little bean and talk to the doctor.  I am beyond excited.

<p>Anyway, definitely get it checked and the supplements do no harm (I&#39;ll still take them next time, just because why not), but in talking to my doctors and doing a lot of research on my own, it really more often is a symptom, rather than the true issue. I don&#39;t know if that&#39;s reassuring or makes it worse, but that&#39;s been what I&#39;ve discovered, as someone who was flipping out about low progesterone from 5 weeks on.  </p>

I am just assuming that was me...here is what I posted, with a few additions for what you are saying, yesbabyplz

Trigger: current pregnancy

With our first, we were waiting til 12 weeks, minimum. But then I lost the baby at 10+6. This time, we plan to announce publicly after my 8+6 scan...and I'd announce right now if my husband would. 

I was a mess after our loss...and was having a hard time hiding my grief. So, I chose not to hide it anymore, and let people know. I am now very open and everyone who knows me knows I had a miscarriage; I have a blog, its on there - I have Facebook, its on there. Going straight to the bad news is not something I enjoyed. But I personally needed to share, as it was/is a huge part of my life. So we have decided to share earlier this time, because we want others to be praying...and I'll need the support if we lose the baby again. I already know I'll be open about another loss, if we have one, and if I'm going to share that, I might as well share the happy news first. Also, I have a cousin who had an 18 week miscarriage and a close friend who lost her baby at 24 weeks. I figure there are no guarantees anyway, so I feel like I might as well enjoy it while I can and have my friends celebrate with me.

As for Facebook, that's actually been great for me. Multiple women I know, some I am close to and others I haven't seen since high school (a long time ago), reached out to met to tell me THEIR stories. Talking to these women was amazing for my emotional healing. And many of them thanked me for being so open about it. Some telling me that they wish they had been at the time. One woman who hasn't had a loss asked me to talk to her sister, who just miscarried - she needed support and was having a hard time talking to people she didn't think understood.  And just recently a 60+ year old man I know through coaching reached out to me...his 33 yo daughter just miscarried and he said his reaction hurt her and he wanted to understand why. He and I talked about my feelings, how I've learned that men and women often feel differently about it, and what she might be needing from him. I feel I really helped him and hopefully helped his relationship with his daughter during such a hard time. Facebook can be used so poorly and so uselessly. And sure, not everyone on there is your close friend. But people care. And people can be there for you when you least expect it and most need it. And Facebook (and other social media) can also be used for GOOD. And I believe one of those good things is the support you can receive, but also the rhetoric of making miscarriage less of a taboo topic. 

Just another perspective, for you to see. I think its a very personal decision and people should do what they feel is right. Including not ""announcing"" at all. And those who announce early DO need to realize that they'll be ""forced"" into telling people about the loss, if it happens. For people who aren't open about that, or don't want to be, its definitely wiser not to announce until later. Its not like running around ""retracting the news"" will be fun for me, but personally I'll be happier to have people know why I'm so upset/sad/pissy all the time.",[],,t1_cypsmgb,False,0,[],False,"<div class=""md""><blockquote>

Even if it may be a short stay, I am super stoked to be here for now.

Anyways. And now: a vent.

Yesterday I posted on my Facebook wall something about super cheap airfare that seems to be caused by a glitch in some airline website. I called my dad to ask him if he would be interested in buying those tickets and he said something along the lines of: Maybe I should post on there that you aren't able to take advantage of that deal because you won't be able to fly. I bet you everyone will get the hint. 

I am 4 weeks and 6 days and already he has started with the emotional blackmail from last time about me not wanting to announce. I don't feel comfortable doing it. I will never feel comfortable doing it. I stand by my decision not to announce last time. It was the right decision for me and my husband. Why can't he understand that?

He told me that by not telling people I am saying with my actions that I don't care about them. This is not true. Last time I was pregnant he tried to guilt me by saying that my grandparents may die and I would forever regret them dying without knowing about my pregnancy (if they die, God forbid, them not knowing wouldn't matter to me. I would just be devastated about their death).

He uses any trick he can think of to make me feel guilty. I decided not to speak to him. I'm not calling him anymore. I called him to share the good news of the hcg doubling and instead of getting support, I just feel isolated.

I only wanted to tell my mother anyways since she has been an amazing source of support but I didn't want to put her in the position of keeping the secret from my dad just like I don't keep secrets from my husband.",[],,t1_cypoy6g,False,0,[],False,"<div class=""md""><p>Dipping my feet into this pool of awesome!</p>

Last time you went through the PPD and all the physical issues, and you need to think about whether you have the energy for another child."" She's told me in the past she thinks I'm better off with one child. 

Needless to say, this hurts every time I hear it, either from her or my crazy mom. Yep, I had PPD pretty bad. Yep, I have endometriosis and joint hypermobility and pregnancy fucked me up pretty bad. But does this mean I don't deserve a second kid, or that I'd be a shitty mom, or that I'd lose myself entirely or wouldn't know what to do? 

LOL on the list of things not to say with women who've had a miscarriage, gotta say, ""You'd better think about this"" is probably up there. It's so condescending, and that's always how I'm treated--like I'm thirteen and I don't know what I'm doing. It's my age, sure, but it's also the fact that I've struggled with depression and anxiety and what they consider to be made-up health issues. My mom has even told me I go to the doctor too much. Sorry if not being able to walk due to endo and scar tissue was something I should have just powered through...

Anyway, that stuck in my craw. I deal with my business, and I'm a pretty good mom. 

Blargh! 
",[],,t1_cypi1du,False,0,[],False,"<div class=""md""><p>I talked to my aunt last night and she point blank asked if we&#39;re going to try to conceive again. I said that we were, and she told me, &quot;You really need to think about this, Hoko. Last time you went through the PPD and all the physical issues, and you need to think about whether you have the energy for another child.&quot; She&#39;s told me in the past she thinks I&#39;m better off with one child. </p>

<p>Needless to say, this hurts every time I hear it, either from her or my crazy mom. Yep, I had PPD pretty bad. Yep, I have endometriosis and joint hypermobility and pregnancy fucked me up pretty bad. But does this mean I don&#39;t deserve a second kid, or that I&#39;d be a shitty mom, or that I&#39;d lose myself entirely or wouldn&#39;t know what to do? </p>

<p>LOL on the list of things not to say with women who&#39;ve had a miscarriage, gotta say, &quot;You&#39;d better think about this&quot; is probably up there. It&#39;s so condescending, and that&#39;s always how I&#39;m treated--like I&#39;m thirteen and I don&#39;t know what I&#39;m doing. It&#39;s my age, sure, but it&#39;s also the fact that I&#39;ve struggled with depression and anxiety and what they consider to be made-up health issues. My mom has even told me I go to the doctor too much. Sorry if not being able to walk due to endo and scar tissue was something I should have just powered through...</p>

<p>Anyway, that stuck in my craw. I deal with my business, and I&#39;m a pretty good mom. </p>

I'm thinking of asking for quants today. The lab is in my building so I could do it. But I'm only 3w2d. Should I wait until my missed period? Will the doctor take me seriously this early? I mean... That's not a squinter. On a Wondfo, that's like 30mL/u easy. Is that safely enough out of CP range? 

Oh god... I did not miss this ""questioning every move I make"" stage. Had a glass of wine and a bunch of brie last night. I hope this goes better than last time.

EDIT: I ended up calling my doctor for a draw. I got the results back toward the end of the day in an email from the nurse. It was 40 (with the range for 3w being 5-50). The nurse said ""this is very low, indicating a very early pregnancy."" The tone was a little on the cautious side, but it occurred to me she didn't know my LMP. This would be very low for a day or two after a missed period, but my period is still 6 days away. My first beta for my first pregnancy was drawn at 4w2d (two days after my missed period) and it was 24! I'm very nearly double that and I haven't even come close to missing a period!! I'm on cloud 9!

<p>I&#39;m thinking of asking for quants today. The lab is in my building so I could do it. But I&#39;m only 3w2d. Should I wait until my missed period? Will the doctor take me seriously this early? I mean... That&#39;s not a squinter. On a Wondfo, that&#39;s like 30mL/u easy. Is that safely enough out of CP range? </p>

<p>Oh god... I did not miss this &quot;questioning every move I make&quot; stage. Had a glass of wine and a bunch of brie last night. I hope this goes better than last time. </p>

<p>EDIT: I ended up calling my doctor for a draw. I got the results back toward the end of the day in an email from the nurse. It was 40 (with the range for 3w being 5-50). The nurse said &quot;this is very low, indicating a very early pregnancy.&quot; The tone was a little on the cautious side, but it occurred to me she didn&#39;t know my LMP. This would be very low for a day or two after a missed period, but my period is still 6 days away. My first beta for my first pregnancy was drawn at 4w2d (two days after my missed period) and it was 24! I&#39;m very nearly double that and I haven&#39;t even come close to missing a period!! I&#39;m on cloud 9! I sent an email back with my LMP; hopefully they&#39;ll get it and understand what I do. I go back Monday for my second draw and they said they&#39;re hoping it&#39;s above 150. I&#39;m very anxious, but we&#39;re starting things off on a better note already so I&#39;m very hopeful. </p>

a. because why would you say that to a pregnant woman?

b. I am obviously pregnant, but I don't think I'm very big.

I did say to him when he worked out I was pregnant 2 weeks ago how far along I was.  I mean I'm nearly 31 weeks.  I was too surprised to really say anything, but mumble, yeah well 9 weeks to go...

Getting pretty exhausted, especially after working 12-14hr shifts over the festive season (they weren't meant to be that long).  Really want a nap everyday.  A little anxious and the stillbirth nightmares have begun.  Feel uncomfortable if sitting for a lengthy period.  Standing and lying down are ok. Other then that, plodding along. 

Congrats to all the new arrivals (babies and alumni) and I love hearing about all the ultrasound and HCG results.  Afraid fatigue and work has stopped me from commenting much, but I am with you guys always and check the thread everyday.  Love to all xoxo

Last week we were on vacation in New Zealand and I felt like I was in such a good place emotionally. We hiked and did awesome activities and drank a lot of wine. However, I did have a sneaky suspicion that this was the month. I had a really strong positive opk followed by a slight ovulation bleed. Then I had an unbelievable amount of acne on my chin and different discharge than what I have on a regular month. 

So I decided that since I wanted to drink and enjoy my vacation, I will test after the year change since that would have been our last day on vacation. 

So the night of the 31st we came back to our hotel room, had a nice local bottle of wine and some tim tams, had great sex and then I tested and it was positive!

I'm not very optimistic about it but I don't think how I feel about it matters.

Initially I wasn't going to announce but I would feel like a fraud posting here and pretending that I'm not pregnant. I didn't feel it would be nice to the amazing community here if I posted on the daily thread while some people are deep in the trenches. 

Anyways, I called my gynecologist's office and asked for an hcg test and they said a hpt should be enough to confirm pregnancy and that I should just make my first prenatal appointment. I said that I have had a previous miscarriage and I would like to confirm a doubling in hcg levels and I also want to know whether I need a levythroxine prescription since I took it during my previous pregnancy and an unbalanced tsh level can cause miscarriage. The secretary asked me how many miscarriages I had (as if 1 isn't enough) and said a nurse will call me. I left a voicemail for the nurse but didn't hear back. I showed up to the office at 4pm and insisted on my hcg and tsh tests and got them :)

I will get results tomorrow and am really hoping for a doubling.


This one may not last just like the first but there's nothing I can do :(

<p>If I may ask, did you have a name picked out for your son? I frequently light a candle in memory of Walker and include many of the other babies from this sub when I do so by name - I would be honored to include your son if it&#39;s something that you would like.</p>

<p>As for your husband, he is more than welcome to reach out to me if he would like to hear my son&#39;s story (or I can send it to you to share with him, or he can search my post history). I wish you both peace and comfort and I truly wish none of us knew this pain. </p>

My husband and I have made 2016 and two more pregnancies (including this one) our tentative limit. We don't have trouble getting pregnant, luckily, but like you, they just don't stick. I'm not 100% sure we will stick with this plan forever, but for me it's about how all-consuming this process is. I can't live my whole life around getting pregnant, and I don't know how to do it any other way. 

I'm lucky in that I'm only 30. But trust me, hearing that I ""have time"" is not the reassurance I would have thought before I started this journey.

I guess what I want to say is that you're not crazy for thinking you might be done, but look at how the process of getting the family you WANT is affecting the family you have. Maybe the cost isn't that high and the possibility of an addition is totally worth it. But for me, I feel desperately like the idea of a never-ending chase is harming my family. With a set close-date, I have an easier time processing it. It makes it more like other life goals:  I am watching a friend's midwifery school applications get denied and it feels more like that, which for me is appropriate. 

Good luck, whatever you choose. This is a hard road to travel and I wish you the best. ",[],,t1_cylrnw0,False,0,[],False,"<div class=""md""><p>I SO feel this question.

There are just somethings that a back rub and a night of sobbing can&#39;t fix, and I think experiencing a loss is pretty much top of the list. I had my first miscarriage 8 years ago, and I was still experiencing trauma from that all the way til now that I never actually realized was still there. Got good at burying things but when you try to conceive again, all those old fears and worries will come back.</p>

<p>This is a good place to help with those fears when you and your partner try again. It&#39;s sad that we&#39;ll never be one of those naive ladies who&#39;ve never experienced the loss before, I&#39;ve worried since the day that strip showed a line. Basically, I am trying to let you know that those fears will come and they are completely natural. You&#39;ll always worry because you went through it once.

As some of you know, my sister is pregnant with twins by some guy that she got knocked up by on her first date. So I really haven't had much to do with her since losing Amaryllis because it's been to hard on me. When I do try to repair our relationship she has turned it around and it's about her and how I've hurt her.
I don't follow her on Facebook but we're friends so I can go onto her page and see if I want. I do go ever so often to check on updates about the babies because I do care about them and I care about her.

Well, I went on her Facebook and saw her ""New Years resolutions""
1) have babies
2)keep babies alive.
Wtf. WHO SAYS THAT SHIT? let alone someone who sat by my side while I gave birth to my stillborn daughter. How can someone be so fucking heartless.
NOT ONLY THAT but someone asked if they found out what happened to Amaryllis and she told them, right there on the status, another person asked when she was due and she nonchalantly talked about how she'll be induced at 38 weeks because of what happened with my daughter. EXCUSE ME? are you talking about your niece or some random baby?!  

I texted her and let her know I saw it and that it was hurtful and insensitive, and for someone to have sat by my side while I gave birth to my stillborn daughter that she would have been a little bit more sensitive to the subject and what is she trying to say about me? I did everything right in my pregnancy and couldn't keep her alive. Silly me for not making it a New Years resolution. That must have been where things went wrong! And to also keep what happened to Amaryllis off Facebook, it's personal and I don't need to be people's gossip. I didn't share it on my Facebook and the people that need to know, know and to keep it at that. I said it Nicely and let her know that I loved her and hoped she could see where I was coming from. 

And she didn't say anything back. NOTHING.

I want to be a part of these babies lives, their my nephews and I love them but I have no idea how the relationship between my sister and I can ever be repaired. I don't know how to be a part of these babies lives but not hers. It's bullshit that I'm mourning my daughter and my sister too.

I had a MMC in June 2015 (was 15 weeks, baby measured 13 weeks). It was very public and devastating.

I ended up going on Zoloft which I'm still taking and it's made a huge difference. We planned to wait a year to TTC again due to the financial and emotional drain of the loss.

Well, surprise, I got pregnant again in October due to a minor slip-up and am now 13 weeks along. I couldn't believe it happened that way after seemingly having so much trouble conceiving the first time. The first tri was absolutely awful symptom-wise but I'm feeling much better now, and husband and I are both over the moon about the possibility of this new little one. But still terrified of course. I'm not planning to publicly announce until about 20 weeks or until I am really obviously showing.

Anyway, glad to meet you all and I know a few of you already (hi!). I am posting because I keep waking up at 3-6am, totally restless, until I figure out I'm just hungry.

I don't know what your history is, but a tragedy like losing a baby can even make a person who had never battled depression think those thoughts. If you are already prone to depression, it can be so much harder to lift yourself out of that place. Here is a list of phone resources to help you *right now.* Don't wait, just call and see if they can help you work through your next steps. http://www.compassionatefriends.org/Find_Support/Online-Community/crisis_hotline_information.aspx

I really hope you feel a little lighter soon. If it helps at all, I will tell you that there were moments after losing our son that I just wanted to die. But I kept dismissing those thoughts and kept thinking, ""that cannot be Henry's legacy - that he ruined his mother and took her life."" That motivation - to make sure he was celebrated and remembered - was what drove me through those dark days when I could find no joy or happiness. The only other piece of advice (and I am no expert) is to allow as much laughter into your life as possible. Anything that has made you laugh since your loss - movies, friends, websites, etc. Soak it in. Overcompensate. Let yourself laugh until you cry and let yourself cry some more. 

I really hope you AND your husband pull through this. I do think sharing with him is important.

I don&#39;t know what your history is, but a tragedy like losing a baby can even make a person who had never battled depression think those thoughts. If you are already prone to depression, it can be so much harder to lift yourself out of that place. Here is a list of phone resources to help you <em>right now.</em> Don&#39;t wait, just call and see if they can help you work through your next steps. <a href=""http://www.compassionatefriends.org/Find_Support/Online-Community/crisis_hotline_information.aspx"">http://www.compassionatefriends.org/Find_Support/Online-Community/crisis_hotline_information.aspx</a></p>

<p>I really hope you feel a little lighter soon. If it helps at all, I will tell you that there were moments after losing our son that I just wanted to die. But I kept dismissing those thoughts and kept thinking, &quot;that cannot be Henry&#39;s legacy - that he ruined his mother and took her life.&quot; That motivation - to make sure he was celebrated and remembered - was what drove me through those dark days when I could find no joy or happiness. The only other piece of advice (and I am no expert) is to allow as much laughter into your life as possible. Anything that has made you laugh since your loss - movies, friends, websites, etc. Soak it in. Overcompensate. Let yourself laugh until you cry and let yourself cry some more. </p>

Then I said &quot;hey, look at us being adults and planning sex to make a baby&quot; because last time we just had sex and wham. He said &quot;yeah, before we were... What&#39;s the acronym? Not trying to do it but also not not trying?&quot; I answered, &quot;NTNP. Not  trying, not preventing. And now we&#39;re doing SMEP! Any idea what that stands for?&quot; Because I&#39;ve totally told him before. He thought a second and then, &quot;Sex man enters pussy!&quot; Lol I was cracking up but writing it out doesn&#39;t sound as funny, so sorry!</p>

<p>I&#39;m also awake and sitting up in bed at 6:30 am because I was waking up a lot and felt... Heavy. My limbs and breathing felt heavy and not sure if that was anxiety but it certainly turned into it. It&#39;s dark and DH is asleep. Feeling a little better, hope I can fall back asleep. When I get like this I have to sit up to breath better. Yesterday was such a good non-anxious day, why now?? </p>

Trying again really scares me. Two weeks ago I had convinced myself that the next pregnancy will inevitably be unsuccessful. I can't miscarry if we don't try, but I also can't have another baby if we don't try. So we are trying and hoping for the best. Miscarriages are so last year.

Holy hell, 2015 was not good to you. Surely this year will be better. It has to be, right? I hope your husband is recovering well.

Good luck starting back to work. You don't have to tell anybody unless you want to. It really helps to talk to people but your work colleagues may or may not be the right people to talk to. Only three people I work with know (my boss, a co-worker whose wife is struggling with infertility, and my good friend). My good friend from work recently told me she was pregnant and I actually had to leave work to go home and cry. 

Crying seems to help. The first few days and nights are the worst, but it does get more bearable. You're going through a whole grieving process which takes time. The hardest part for me was grieving the hopes and dreams we had attached to the first non-progressive pregnancy. We had thought about how life would change as a result of the pregnancy and then it didn't happen. That took until after the due date to get over. Cry, talk, post here, do whatever you need to work through the the grief.

While we were at the hospital during my most recent miscarraige, my husband who works with a lot of paramedics ran into at least four people he knew. He felt like he had to explain why he was hanging out in the emergency room. That sucked. He has been a lot more open with his work colleagues than I have been with mine and I'm not sure why. Maybe I just can't handle the pity.

You'll probably be able to separate your work from the experiences you had in that hospital, but it will be difficult being confronted so many reminders of last year on a daily basis. The wifi project will be interesting and so important to hospital infrastructure. I hope you enjoy it, despite the setting.

How on earth they can claim she is not contagious is beyond me. Pretty sure if you were vomiting less than 24 hours ago, you would definitely still be contagious. Oh, and these people both used to work in healthcare... Really brilliant.

I hope my SIL finds strength and a balance of medications, therapy, and routines that help her feel healthier and happier. I hope my sister takes care of herself and makes better financial decisions.

<p>Trying to stay calm and positive. I can only take it day by day and right now I&#39;m pregnant.</p>

<p>UPDATE! My Ob called and left a message about my blood work before they left for the day. My HCG as of 11 AM today is 8102. They didn&#39;t leave anything about the progesterone but right now I&#39;m happy! </p>

I've been taking progesterone supplements for coming up on two years.  When I first went off of birth control, I noticed that my luteal phase was around 8-10 days before I started spotting (and a few days later, I'd get my period).  I was concerned that my progesterone levels were not high enough to sustain a pregnancy.  After a chemical pregnancy a few months later, I began seeing an RE.  My RE shared that luteal phase defect/low progesterone is somewhat controversial - that some believe it is an issue, can lead to miscarriage, etc. and others don’t.  But, she said that going on progesterone supplements would not hurt, if it would make me feel more comfortable.  

Since then, I start progesterone three days post ovulation - I use the Crinone vaginal gel once every morning.  Two weeks post ovulation, I go in for a pregnancy test.  If the result is negative, I stop the Crinone and a few days later I get my period.  If the result is positive, I continue with the progesterone (through to 10-12 weeks).  

I haven’t had any problems with the Crinone, but it can get a little messy.  After a few days there will be a build-up of discharge – I was advised by my nurse to “swipe and clean” in the shower each morning.  I would also advise wearing a panty liner.  It can also irritate the cervix so it’s not unusual to see colored discharge – pink, brown, etc. which freaked me out a little the first time I saw it.  I know some people use suppositories but I haven’t tried those.
  
Since starting the progesterone supplements, I've had three pregnancies.  Unfortunately they have all ended in miscarriages.  The first happened at home so we weren’t able to do any testing.  The second and third I got D&Cs, and testing confirmed chromosomal abnormalities (not related, just bad luck both times).  For the second and third pregnancies, I switched to progesterone in oil injections once I had confirmed my pregnancy.  It’s hard to explain, but with the first pregnancy, on the Crinone, I began to feel “backed up” and I just had this (irrational) fear that the progesterone was not getting where it needed to go.  So with my later pregnancies I switched to the PIO.  

The injections are more challenging and I’d be happy to share more info about what has worked well, etc.  But, I think they’d be more likely to start you on the gel or the suppositories.  

One additional thing I wanted to mention – my RE mentioned that progesterone levels fluctuate throughout the day. She was always hesitant to test levels as one moment they could be low, the next high.  

From what I’ve been told, there is not a downside to going on progesterone.  My recommendation is to go for it.  I know that some people start once a pregnancy is confirmed, others start post ovulation like I do.  It provided me with a lot of reassurance (even though my pregnancies in the end were not successful).

I just need to get this off my chest. It's only our second full day in Ireland and my husband has managed to put a dark cloud over our whole trip. Lately he's just seemed a bit off, which I just put down to work, but last night he just lost it. 

At about 8pm or so last night he left for a lads night out since he hasn't seen his mates in nearly 6 months. I stayed in with his mum and sister and we just chatted over a few glasses of wine. When I went to bed he wasn't back yet. At about 4am I heard his mum calling my name. I thought what is going on. His best mate brought him home and he was swinging at him and telling him he couldn't go home. It took his mate, his mum and I to get him in the door. He kept on like he had to get out and was hallucinating that a giant tidal wave was coming. He was seeing things as well. It took his mum and I ages to get him to the bed and he was so angry and out of it he was swinging at the air and punching the headboard. Trying to keep him from hurting himself I've got brusies all over myself. He didn't even know who I was. He was even hitting my back like I was killing him trying to keep him in bed and from hurting himself or waking up and upsetting his sister's children. He even tried to take a shit in the bed. It took until 8:30am to get him in bed to sleep. 

This afternoon when he finally got up he wouldn't talk to us at all. Apparently he thinks it's my fault for bringing him to Ireland, but he doesn't actually know what he's done, just that he was an outrageous asshole. He rang one of his mates to get out of the house. Before they left I told his friend what happened last nigt and he promised not to let him drink at all and that he'd talk to him. Hopefully he'll talk some sense into him and he'll come back and apologize. He'd never ever do anything like that sober. 

Right now I'm just so upset about it all I don't want to start IUI in January. I don't even know what to say to him about it. If he wants to drink more he's not allowed to stay at his mums/sisters. We had plans to have a nice dinner New Year's Eve and go to the local for a few. But now that's ruined.  

I'm a bit determined to not let this ruin our holiday, but it's really hard. I know once his mate tells him what he's done he's not going to want to face any of us because he'll be so ashamed. But he really needs to come back here and apologize to everyone. I just hope he'll smarten up and realize that it's his own fault for drinking so much and not try to blame it on something else. 

I hope that everyone else is having a better day and that you'll all have a great New Year's Eve tomorrow.  

Edit: since first posting DH has rang to say he knows how badly he's fucked up and that he's going to stay away from the drink. He's had stuff on his mind that's bothering him, but he has to find a better way to deal with it because he knows he can't do what he did again. He knows he has to do a lot to make it up to me, his mother, and his sister. He knows he's not getting off the hook easy and he's going to have to work to make it up to us for what an outrageous bollox he's been. I still think he needs to work on stuff before I feel ok starting IUI.

I am so ready and eager for Charlie to be here, safe and sound - I continue to hope and want nothing but the best for you because you deserve it. &lt;3</p>

Two things: it's no ones fault so don't place blame either way. Second, the more pressure you put on it the less it will happen. Go on a cruise, take a class together (wine, cooking, beer tasting whatever). Try to relax, it's not going to be easy, but you have to try. If you have a lapse and need to cry don't hide it, share a good cry together. Hubby will be there for you. When you're relaxed and a little time has passed it will happen. As for intimacy, do the research, most dr recommend a few months of your body healing so maybe use protection. Be intimate, and have fun. Kind of like when you're single, when you stop looking you meet someone, same thing here. When you least expect it, it will happen.

Monday i went to see a gyno at the hospital because i had weird spotting. I worried to death the whole weekend that i might have PiD or god knows what that will leave me infertile. Well luck was on my side this time... Just some retained tissue. I wonder why this was not spotter two weeks after the medical termination, at the follow up check up. So i was scheduled to have a vacum d&c the next day. It went well, i was told... No complications (gosh i hope it is true). By now i have been through both the medicated termination right after the mc and a d&c more than five weeks later. I feel drained and empty. I have had on and off bleeding for the past five weeks. Every time i thought i had menstruation, i was wrong. I have only been able to be intimate with my so four times since the mc. It makes me sad.

But above all i am drained and lost and dissappointed. I was hoping to start trying at the start of next year. But my body wont cooperate, it just wont. I am not allowed any sex for four weeks. I was hoping to at least have ovulation in january. I have no idea when my body will start to function. And my dream of becoming a mother in 2016 seems to be getting fainter and fainter. I have now realized that it would take great luck for this to happen. I no longer feel lucky.

And also...on monday, when i was waiting to see the doc and had been waiting for over an hour... A young woman came in. All cryed out. With a man. I knew when i lookes at her why she was there. She had seen bleeding and she had rushed to see a doc but she knew that the pregnancy was over. The next day she was in the bed beside mine. She was getting a medicated termination... I heard them tell her how it is safer for women who have not given birth yet, lesser chance of complications. She was me a few weeks ago. and it broke my heart. Why? Another me... Why does this happen, it is unfair. Why is there so many of us? I peeked through the curtain and i told her that i had been through the same and that the counxelor they have at the hoapital is great and that i am sorry. I dont know if i did the right thing or the wrong thing, if she was the kind of person to welcome such intrusion in to her private life but i wanted to help her. I just find it all so unfair and wrong and i wish none of us would ever have to go though this. It is horrid.

And i got through the holidays without anyone asking about our baby plans. And i decided that when i do manage to get pregnant the next time.. I will share the news early. I know the risk of losing my baby, know it feom experience... And the thought of saftey is just an illusion. There is no such thing. And i want to be able to be happy about being pregnant, not hide my happiness, i want to be able to celebrate and be pregnant, Regardless of the risk.

Remembered to take my temp this morning, it feels good to be doing something toward TTC again. I've already looked ahead at what dates we'll need to BD on haha.

For the longest time we'd had a boy name picked out. We tried my whole pregnancy (~1 month) to agree on a girl name and couldn't. But now we finally have one :) I've been drawn to the name June for a while but my EDD was in the month of June, so I didn't want to use it. But I brought it up now and DH said he likes it. I know I'd want to call her Juni. 

So our names are Henry and June. DH immediately said that sounds familiar so we googled it, and apparently it is a movie/book, but not one I know. Then we saw where we know it from: Kablam!! A Nickelodeon show from the 90s. They are the two host characters. Pretty funny, but I think if we ever end up with a boy and girl I'd still give them those names.

We have been at my mom's for 4 days now, and our moods are suffering. We don't sleep well and we don't get time alone, and we're both still bothered by how Xmas went with MIL. 

My mom is from another country and we typically go visit there in the summer every year. Last year DH went for the first time. This year my mom went alone. Last night my mom was discussing next year and who would be able to go, and DH said he'd like his mom to go too and that she'd like it a lot. OH MY GOD, that sounds like a *nightmare* to me. It's a long trip there, and we'd have to stay in the same studio apartment. And I'd be basically alone that whole time because she clings to DH and just talks to him and would especially do so in a country where she can't speak the language.

I'm sorry about all of your losses.  It's hard.  It really is. How far apart have your losses been?  I lost a ton of blood on my third loss and returned to work after a hospital-wide computer migration so I was sad, terribly anemic and felt like the stupidest person in my department.  That's crazy that you lost that much blood during a D&C. 
After my 2nd loss, I tried to see an old therapist and she was not helpful at all. She kept nudging me to consider adoption or just be happy with only having one child.  I had reached out to my current therapist at that point but she was pretty booked at the time so I just tried to power through.  When I got pregnant with #4 (loss #3), I contacted her again and she squeeze me in.  Honestly, I think she just really speaks my language.  I am a scientist who has always been deeply interested in end of life issues, Buddhist philosophy and medicine.  When we talk about how to deal with stress/anxiety/uncertainty she speaks to me using language and examples from neurological research to quotes of Buddhist nuns.  She just gets me and I get her.  We laugh a lot and have a ton of respect for each other.  We have worked a lot on trying to stop bracing against possible negative outcomes; to just accept things as they happen in real time. We talk about allowing joy and sorrow to simultaneously exist. We talk about not allowing grief to close my mental aperture on all the good in my life.  Really I think that the more you experience loss, you either become very jaded/brittle or you learn to speed through the 5 stages of grief and end up at acceptance a lot sooner. Case in point, I used to chomp at the bit for my HCG to zero out so I could get my period so I could try again.  Me obsessing over it was not helping speed things along.  It was just consuming a bunch of energy that could have been better spent elsewhere. 
I also gave up Crossfit/weightlifting for yoga after that loss that left me anemic.  We meditate at the beginning and end of class. That has been good at quieting my mind.  In general, I became more gentle with myself.  I declined social invitations unless they were with people who made me laugh hysterically or let me cry if need be.  I let myself watch a ton of TV and fed my family very simple meals instead of elaborate ones.  I don't vacuum as much as I probably should.  
I have found this forum to be very helpful.  It can be hard at times because every person is just at their own place in the grieving or TTC process.

<p>Update 2: She&#39;s here! After just over 6 hours of labor and 13 minutes of pushing, my sweet baby girl is here. 8 lbs 5 oz, 20&quot; long.  She&#39;s nursing away, and I am so happy. Thank you all for everything; I couldn&#39;t have made it without this community.</p>

Anyways, last night at dinner out of nowhere she just blurts out across the whole table, &quot;Did y&#39;all think that  _________ was going to happen in Star Wars??!&quot; When my husband and I had CLEARLY SAID MULTIPLE TIMES that we hadn&#39;t seen the movie yet. Everyone else at the table just stared at her (because they&#39;d listened to us saying all night to please not spoil it for us). Then her reaction was just to laugh about it for the next ten minutes saying, &quot;Hahaha oops, I&#39;m sorry!&quot; Ugh. I&#39;m still pissed and don&#39;t want to go downstairs this morning. Hopefully venting makes it easier to face today since I haven&#39;t even told my husband how pissed I am...he, along with his family, is used to her and sees no wrong in any of her actions ever. </p>

<p>I&#39;ll end with a bright note. I&#39;m so thankful to have a happy, healthy baby growing inside me. I keep flipping back through my pictures and picturing LO squirming around on the screen yesterday! He/she will be my focus. :) Have a great day everyone! </p>

I though it would be easier than the first two, but it's not. Physically it was because it was a natural miscarriage instead of the MMCs which required surgery, but mentally it has really fucked with my head.

Becoming part of the miscarriage club really sucks, but it's actually really comforting to know there are so many of us out there who have been through this. Most people will have one, maybe two miscarriages. I never thought I'd be part of the very small percentage of women to have three (or more). I always figure when the odds are so low, it won't happen to me. Like, chances are I won't be the one to die in a terrorist attack or be eaten by a shark or spontaneously combust. That happens to other people, right? Well, this time I'm the exception to the rule so surely that bodes well for the rest of you. Statistics say you'll be just fine and your next pregnancy will be successful. And I take a weird sort of comfort in knowing that this won't happen to most people, as if being the statistic is taking one for the team. Somebody has to be the one eaten by a shark.

After three miscarriages I have now been referred to the recurrent miscarriage clinic to try to find out what's wrong. They may find something, they may not, but at least we can start looking for answers.

While I'm confident I'll get pregnant again (hell, I've done it 4 times so by now I'm pretty good at it) I have very little faith it will be successful. At this point I'm afraid to even try again. Another miscarriage seems like an inevitability. I said to my husband, ""I have no reason to believe the next pregnancy will be any different than the last three."" He said, ""Our child. Our child is the reason to believe it will be different."" And he's right. I've done this before. I can do this again. But my success rate isn't great (one for four). Even Shaq's abysmal free throw percentage back in the day was better than that.

Today my friend told me she is pregnant. This is great news!  While I'm really really happy for her, it has sent me into a spin. Had I not miscarried this last pregnancy, we would have been due less than a week apart. Our kids are best friends and I couldn't help but think how wonderful it would have been for our second ones to be born so close together. 

I was able to be happy for her for about 5 minutes until that thought crossed my mind and couldn't help myself and broke into tears. I hate that I let my pain overshadow her happiness. It's not fair to her. I wish I could have hidden the tears. She knew about my first two miscarriages but not about the most recent one. We've stopped telling people because it's just too sad. Then wasn't the time to tell her but it would be weird to cry and not explain why.

We work together and she told me this at lunch. Since it is Christmas Eve I had planned on leaving early anyway, but I ended up taking a taxi home after lunch so I could come home, cry, and write this sad yet cathartic post. 

Maybe it's my period that has me crying at the drop of a hat (the other morning I spent an hour crying for no particular reason) or maybe I'm depressed. Either way, it's probably best to talk to a professional rather than just lovely, well-meaning strangers on the Internet.

Since things are likely going to be fairly hectic for me up until we head away I thought I'd just give a quick update since I likely won't be able to post again until after January 9th. 

Today is CD 23, I didn't bother tracking ovulation this cycle since we're taking a mini break until IUI starts in January. I started spotting this evening, TMI a mix of pink and brown. I doubt it is anything as positive as implantation as I think we missed my window. But if it's early AF it's a negative and a positive mixed in one. Since AF is coming early I suspect this was an anovulary cycle, which makes me feel less bad for missing my usual fertile window even though we're trying not to think so much about TTC. But it also makes me a little more worried about my low ovarian reserve. However, on the positive side, if AF is early it will mean the worst of my usual endo cramps will be over before we fly to Ireland, which will make the flight so much less stressful for me.

I've also been really down lately. I keep realizing that if I don't get a positive next cycle it will be a year since the cycle I got pregnant (that cycle started Jan 1st). Also if our first IUI cycle doesn't work it will be a year since the MC. Being sad and doing holiday visits feels weird because I put on a smile and do my best to be cheerful, but inside I just want to curl up alone and cry a bit and maybe kill somethings in an RPG. Hopefully though I'll manage to have a good cry and get it out of my system before heading off.

I'll start with the TTC update - last cycle wasn't it. CD5 this morning. Not sure how trying will pan out this cycle as we are still waiting on first appointment with RE. Have no idea how long her cycle will be without the Clomid to shorten it. She doesn't want to take OPKs anymore so we will just try every other day, I think, and temping will confirm O after it happens (if it happens).

I spent a long weekend in NYC visiting with my grandma who's 91 and been in and out of the hospital recently. She was home while we were there and it was so great to see her. She's really sharp and all there mentally, which is a blessing, but has gotten pretty frail physically. On Sunday her church (which she used to be active in, singing in the choir and such, but lately she hasn't gotten out much) surprised her by coming over and singing Christmas carols. The pure, unadulterated joy on her face was just overwhelming. Seeing her singing along, smiling, with her family and friends there made the whole trip. Afterwards she was so happy she was crying, which of course had me blinking back tears. I also went to see the tree at 30 Rock, drank lots of coffee, and generally froze my ass off. Wonderful trip. 

Last big update - we bought a house! Or rather are building a house. It's exactly what we wanted, at the perfect price, and will cut my commute from half an hour to under ten minutes. Pictures will be forthcoming at some point, perhaps, if I ever get around to it. Now we just need to sell our house in the next six months. Eeek!

In the end he apologized for what he said and realized it was a bit insensitive because he sees that we are dealing with everything differently.

<p>Maybe it&#39;s all my hormones but if the roles were reversed I wouldn&#39;t be this negative to some one, especially when our dr&#39;s are totally different on their pregnancy care. Ugh, I wanted this to be a fun time - our kids should be 6-7 weeks apart...Why does she have to be so nasty? I mean we&#39;re freaking neighbors and it&#39;s hubby&#39;s sister...</p>

<p>/End rant - sorry that felt good to get it out. Nobody in real life really gets it, I am thankful that you do!</p>

1st - in no way should you postpone TTC for a wedding, even your sisters. You can't put your life on hold for others. I have multiple friends who have weddings later in 2016 or early 2017 (a couple that I am in) and they all know I might have to back out last minute if necessary, depending on how TTC goes for us. 

I don't think its selfish of her, though. She can't plan her wedding around other people's lives, especially to include every possible scenario.  The same as I told you, she can't put her life on hold for others.

I would just accept the honor and see how things go with TTC. You can even explain that to her before/while accepting so she knows your thoughts and concerns. Once you are pregnant again, you'll have a better idea of dates/ages and can go from there.  If you end up having a very young baby for April 2017, then she will either have to make an exception or lose her MOH. That's not unreasonable in the least. And if you end up where you'll be too pregnant to travel and be her MOH, that will just have to change -- that's life. It WILL be selfish of her to not deal with THAT situation well, but you can't foresee that.

There is a range of time it takes, even if you know when you ovulated, that may differ from pregnacy to pregnancy.  

+ Once you ovulate, it can take 5-12 days for implantation to complete.  
+ Time for sperm to meet egg, to travel through the Fallopian tube, and to actually implant are different every time.
+ You can get a positive pregnancy before implantation because hcg will start increasing as soon as sperm meets egg, even though the embryo won't start growing at normal speeds until implantation is completed, so it is within reason for you to have completed conception on 11/22 and have gotten a positive so soon after.  

I know it is hard to be hopeful right now, especially with your past, but the reason your doc is a bit vague is because of these differences that they really can't measure.  Things could be perfectly normal, or they may not be. It could be that you just implanted late, so the baby is starting out behind the curve, but will grow steadily from here on out.  

It sounds like your doc checked your progesterone levels?  Were they all good?  A common cause of early loss is low progesterone, so if that isn't where you want it, don't be afraid to ask for supplementation.

Sorry you are going through this. 

Hugs!

I came off the nuva ring at the end of May and six weeks later had a positive pregnancy test. First scan at 6 weeks found a tiny heartbeat and a 10cm cyst. My 12 week scan found a missed miscarriage, probably at 7 weeks but my body was still 100% convinced it was pregnant (i.e. hormone levels consistent with 12 week pregnancy). D&C followed and my six week follow up found the cyst unchanged.

I got pregnant my first real cycle trying so I don't think it had an impact on my fertility but then again I had a miscarriage so maybe it interfered with a viable pregnancy? It could potentially have caused problems in later pregnancy due to it's size, I was told they'd remove it in the second trimester if it hadn't shrunk. Since I do want to have a baby and it was taking up a lot of space in my abdomen it seemed best to remove it before going again.

There are so many different types of cysts though that this probably isn't relevant to your situation. Some types do interfere, most won't cause a problem. My reading suggests anything below 5cm is considered fairly typical and likely to resolve itself. Most people have a cyst about that size at the start of the pregnancy from where the egg left the ovary.

Removing mine has had an impact on my fertility, but it's negative - he had to take some of the fallopian tube to remove it completely.

My husband still has to work in between so I&#39;ll be home to spend some time with his mom.  I don&#39;t mind, we get along well.  I&#39;m really welcoming the long break as well.  </p>

<p>If this cycle followed my previous cycles, I should have O&#39;ed on the 15th as well putting me at 6DPO.  I don&#39;t know if that&#39;s true or not, I&#39;m not tracking this month.  Your temps are nice and high!  I&#39;m keeping my fingers crossed for you whether you&#39;re 6DPO or 10DPO (or somewhere in the middle).  </p>

So I saw my ""sister"" this weekend.  I was prepared for the worst and it was worse than I anticipated but in a different way.  There wasn't any baby talk really, nor did she ask me to feel him kick.  But the second she walked through the door with her very noticeable baby bump, my eyes welled up with tears.  Just from the *sight* of her.  I smiled and quickly looked at my phone to keep anyone from noticing.  She instinctively rubbed her belly the majority of the time she was there, but I can't blame her for that (I'm not even pregnant and I find myself subconsciously rubbing my belly as if I were from time to time).  My husband pointed out to me yesterday that she doesn't seem to be liking the not drinking thing as she kept taking drinks from her husband's beer and spoke about how she had drank a few glasses of wine at their party the day before.  

We stayed at ""mom and dad's"" house so ""sister"" and her husband left at about midnight on Saturday night.  When I woke up yesterday morning it was just ""mom"" and I up.  She confided in me that she's not loving my ""sister's"" husband.  He's very childish and apparently somewhat verbally abusive to her (she didn't use those words but that's what I'm classifying it as).  They fight all the time and it results in him screaming at her about how everything is her fault- all of their fights, issues, etc..  This has continued through the pregnancy.  She told him that it's not healthy for her or the baby to get worked up like that all the time and he told her ""that's a myth"".  ""Mom"" told me that she doesn't think their marriage will last (something my husband and I suspected from the beginning; they've only been married a little over a year).  Then she told me that when my ""sister"" told her they were pregnant she had a pit in her stomach.  Of course, she's thrilled to be a grandma but she knows what that baby is being born into.  I asked her if my ""sister's"" husband knows what having a baby will be like.  She said no, he has no idea.  He will do zero work and it will be completely on my ""sister"" (he's never gotten out of bed just to let the dogs out).  

I asked her why they started trying 2 years earlier than they had planned on as it was something that's been bothering me (I'm still convinced she wanted to one-up me and be the first one pregnant because that's just how she is- just petty).  She said she has no idea.  I said something about how they managed to conceive on their first attempt and she agreed that it was a surprise.  I made a comment about how I wished it were that easy for us and she gave the typical don't-know-what-to-say response of ""it'll happen"".  Without really thinking I said ""oh, it already has... twice... I just can't seem to keep it"".  She said ""oh, Alison... I know exactly what you're going through"".  We hugged and both cried.  She told me that she lost her first at 18 weeks- something I had never known.  It's amazing how many people have suffered loss and most would never know it.  I really wasn't planning on telling her but I'm really happy I did- I don't like holding that in.  

I've said it before and I'll say it again- this just isn't fair.

I'm wondering if I should call my doctor today or not. Briefly: had a D&C at 11 weeks on 11/18. On 12/10, doctor gave me the OK to try again, and we did right away. I've had positive pregnancy tests yesterday and today. I can't quite bring myself to say ""I'm pregnant,"" but it seems like the most likely situation. 

So... I'm leaving for a week long vacation in the Caribbean on Wednesday. Does it make sense to try to get blood work done before I go? There's only two days, I don't know what sort of interval is ideal. Or should I wait until I get back?  

I am so numb, I am just trying to keep myself at an emotional remove right now. I know if I get my period because it's a false positive, or a CP, I will be in a bad place.
