My first loss was quick and natural I should have been 7w but there was literally nothing to see by the time I was in the ER (not sure if there was any development). I had a week of period like bleeding and was told we could try again after my next period. 


Sperm accidentally met egg before my period returned (4 weeks post loss, meaning my cycle would have been about a week longer than my normal) and so my blighted ovum implanted. My body was not keen on natural miscarriage (I gave it a week) so I opted for a D&C. A woman I know in a similar situation waited a full month to see if her body would naturally miscarry (it didn‚Äôt). Recovery from d&c was about 2 weeks of bleeding for me.


We were told 1 cycle after d&c, we did try a little but after a consultation with another doctor switched back to using protection with a goal of starting fresh in the new year. Protection failed (still unsure how) and I became pregnant with my ectopic. After that whole saga (surgery was required) we were told 2 cycles. We ended up waiting longer due to life circumstances but managed to conceive on our first try. 


My cousin also had a loss (8 weeks) and her period returned exactly 4 weeks after her hcg reached 0 and it took 5 months for her to conceive her LO. That‚Äôs about on par with average TTC times.

I've found the distraction of work is helpful for me, as long as I'm continuing to process my grief in a healthy way. My old coworkers knew of both of my losses as they were happening. Now I have a new job and virtually no one at work knows about my most recent loss (I did tell my supervisor since I was still bleeding when I went back to work). There are pros and cons to both approaches in terms of helping me deal with everything. I did have times when the sadness would just come on so strong and all I wanted to do was cry- if I was at work, I'd try to hold it in and wait until I got home to let it loose. I think you just have to let the grief move through you, and try not to fight it, as much as is practical. In time, it does pass. Well, not pass really, but change and become more manageable. 

I've had times when I don't want to do anything and don't care about anything. I'm a teacher, so I feel I have to go to work for my students. Sometimes they are the only thing that gets me out of bed and into work. And then I have to fake being okay, which forces me to be okay for chunks of time. 

People say not to make big changes when you are going through grief, and I think there is some logic to that.

I had been unhappy at work for a while before my miscarriages, and even though my original plan for getting out of there wasn't going to work, I knew I had to leave anyway. Once you know it's time for a change, you can't unknow it.

You have every right to be angry and upset and resentful, it‚Äôs a shitty set of cards you were dealt‚Äî but do be wary of your brother‚Äôs intention. He very well may have forgotten that you had that date so special in your head. (It‚Äôs a pretty jerk move if he did it on purpose, but unlikely.) 

My brother‚Äôs girlfriend got pregnant a few weeks after my loss, and I just recently found out (at 5 months) because he had been trying to shield me from it. (He had a loss at 7 months about 10 years due to a car accident.) I was still upset. I still hung up on my mom after she told me and bawled my face off. I still cut the conversation short after I texted him congratulations. I‚Äôm lucky that he knew the pain, and didn‚Äôt try to push the conversation, but I hate everything about the whole situation even if I still love him. 

I wasn‚Äôt as lucky with my cousin‚Äôs baby, who was due two weeks before mine. (For reference, I had an unexplained loss at 20 weeks. No heartbeat.) My grandmother trying to be inclusive kept bugging me to come down (12 hour drive) for her baby shower, and called me the day her baby was born. I know she just wanted to keep me in the loop, but fuck if that baby wasn‚Äôt just a beacon of everything I didn‚Äôt have. Same age, same sex, and to top it off, my cousin‚Äôs an 18 year old fuck up with a drug dealer boyfriend. I still haven‚Äôt been down, and I don‚Äôt know when or if I‚Äôm ever going to be able to handle being around this kid. It wasn‚Äôt that my grandma was trying to be mean, nobody on that side of the family has had a loss. She just didn‚Äôt get it. Eventually, I just bluntly had to tell her that I would ask about the baby if I wanted to hear about it, and if I didn‚Äôt, the baby didn‚Äôt exist as far as I‚Äôm concerned. 

Long story short, let yourself be upset, angry, mad‚Äî song loud to some sad or angry music, cry it out, give yourself some time and space and keep in mind these people just don‚Äôt get it, and they probably aren‚Äôt trying to be mean. And no, I don‚Äôt think you ever really get over it. If you had seen and held that baby even for a minute, you wouldn‚Äôt even ask that question, and other people wouldn‚Äôt assume you would get over it‚Äî but just because you didn‚Äôt get to, doesn‚Äôt mean that baby was any less real to you. ",[],,t1_ecoeo3w,False,0,[],False,"<div class=""md""><p>You‚Äôre not a horrible person. You have every right to be angry and upset and resentful, it‚Äôs a shitty set of cards you were dealt‚Äî but do be wary of your brother‚Äôs intention. He very well may have forgotten that you had that date so special in your head. (It‚Äôs a pretty jerk move if he did it on purpose, but unlikely.) </p>

<p>My brother‚Äôs girlfriend got pregnant a few weeks after my loss, and I just recently found out (at 5 months) because he had been trying to shield me from it. (He had a loss at 7 months about 10 years due to a car accident.) I was still upset. I still hung up on my mom after she told me and bawled my face off. I still cut the conversation short after I texted him congratulations. I‚Äôm lucky that he knew the pain, and didn‚Äôt try to push the conversation, but I hate everything about the whole situation even if I still love him. </p>

<p>I wasn‚Äôt as lucky with my cousin‚Äôs baby, who was due two weeks before mine. (For reference, I had an unexplained loss at 20 weeks. No heartbeat.) My grandmother trying to be inclusive kept bugging me to come down (12 hour drive) for her baby shower, and called me the day her baby was born. I know she just wanted to keep me in the loop, but fuck if that baby wasn‚Äôt just a beacon of everything I didn‚Äôt have. Same age, same sex, and to top it off, my cousin‚Äôs an 18 year old fuck up with a drug dealer boyfriend. I still haven‚Äôt been down, and I don‚Äôt know when or if I‚Äôm ever going to be able to handle being around this kid. It wasn‚Äôt that my grandma was trying to be mean, nobody on that side of the family has had a loss. She just didn‚Äôt get it. Eventually, I just bluntly had to tell her that I would ask about the baby if I wanted to hear about it, and if I didn‚Äôt, the baby didn‚Äôt exist as far as I‚Äôm concerned. </p>

<p>Long story short, let yourself be upset, angry, mad‚Äî song loud to some sad or angry music, cry it out, give yourself some time and space and keep in mind these people just don‚Äôt get it, and they probably aren‚Äôt trying to be mean. And no, I don‚Äôt think you ever really get over it.

I'm 25 as well and my son was diagnosed with a pretty rare trisomy and *all* of the doctors made comments about how infrequently they see women my age recieve this diagnosis and I was so angry. I went into labor during the termination and then had a month of significant pain after the fact. 

A friend of mine announced that she was due just a few days after my initial due date and I hated her. But...not really. I hated the absence of *that* joy in my life. I resented the fact that I wasn't happy and expecting a bundle of my own. You aren't horrible for grieving. What you lost is something that will never go away, because you didn't lose a baby as much as you lost a future. And every single day you live is a day that's different than it would have been had you not lost the pregnancy, which is (I think) why pregnancy loss at any stage often feels painful for so long. From the moment of your loss onward, you've been living in the loss reality instead of the happy family reality and you're watching other people pop into that happy reality while lookers on ask you why you're not trying to get there too. It sucks. 

For me, it's been about accepting that I'm allowed to feel these things, but not letting them change me. That hate, it isn't me. I don't act on it. But if I tell myself that I have no right to feel it, I'll only make things worse. I give myself a few minutes to write out all of my angry feelings, then I tell myself that I need to focus on actionable, helpful thoughts. If the worry or thought isn't productive, I save it for my venting time. There is a difference between acknowledging a thought and indulging in it. Just like when you're on a diet, you can indulge every so often, but too much indulgence isn't healthy.

I&#39;m 25 as well and my son was diagnosed with a pretty rare trisomy and <em>all</em> of the doctors made comments about how infrequently they see women my age recieve this diagnosis and I was so angry. I went into labor during the termination and then had a month of significant pain after the fact. </p>

<p>A friend of mine announced that she was due just a few days after my initial due date and I hated her. But...not really. I hated the absence of <em>that</em> joy in my life. I resented the fact that I wasn&#39;t happy and expecting a bundle of my own. You aren&#39;t horrible for grieving. What you lost is something that will never go away, because you didn&#39;t lose a baby as much as you lost a future. And every single day you live is a day that&#39;s different than it would have been had you not lost the pregnancy, which is (I think) why pregnancy loss at any stage often feels painful for so long. From the moment of your loss onward, you&#39;ve been living in the loss reality instead of the happy family reality and you&#39;re watching other people pop into that happy reality while lookers on ask you why you&#39;re not trying to get there too. It sucks. </p>

<p>For me, it&#39;s been about accepting that I&#39;m allowed to feel these things, but not letting them change me. That hate, it isn&#39;t me. I don&#39;t act on it. But if I tell myself that I have no right to feel it, I&#39;ll only make things worse. I give myself a few minutes to write out all of my angry feelings, then I tell myself that I need to focus on actionable, helpful thoughts. If the worry or thought isn&#39;t productive, I save it for my venting time. There is a difference between acknowledging a thought and indulging in it. Just like when you&#39;re on a diet, you can indulge every so often, but too much indulgence isn&#39;t healthy. </p>

<p>There is no normal. This experience is different for everyone because no one copes in the same way. But, I&#39;d suggest that we can all relate to these experiences. You aren&#39;t alone. This is an extremely supportive community, and I hope you find some warmth among us.</p>

You can track your HCG levels as they fall either with blood tests with your doctor or by using early response pregnancy tests at home. Once your HCG gets below 5, there appears to be a roughly 50% chance (this is based purely on my talking to women who have gone through it over the last two years - not scientific or serious research-based evidence!) that you will ovulate within a few days. However, a lot of women (again, about 50% of those I've personally talked to, myself included) immediately get their periods the day or the day after their HCG hits zero without ovulating beforehand. At that point, usually your cycle begins, though post MMC cycles are frequently somewhat irregular. Often women find that their cycles are about a week or so longer for a couple of months, usually due to delayed ovulation. Your old period dates are no longer relevant at all, so you should reset your app. If you want to start TTC right away, then you should disregard your app for a few months and use opks or temping or both to monitor your ovulation. A lot of women have permanently altered cycles after pregnancy (like it might be 30 days now rather than 28, with your O on day 16 rater than day 14), and if they rely on their old ovulation dates, they can easily miss them.

My husband agreed to really try next month (if I&#39;m not already pregnant) because January is our &quot;ideal&quot; month to get pregnant (if that&#39;s even a thing) because we feel October is a good &quot;birthday month&quot; and you don&#39;t have to worry about it being too close to Thanksgiving or Christmas. This month we&#39;ll be fine with but September does already have several birthdays in the family so another month wouldn&#39;t be the worst thing. Not a birthday is everything. As long as we end up with a healthy baby at the end we&#39;ll be happy! It&#39;s hard knowing how little control I have over this process.

Tonight I'll be at my aunt's surrounded by a lot of kids, babies, and pregnant women.

It's always so tough, especially this time of year. My best advice is just to take things one day at a time and never be afraid to take time for yourself when you need it. Some days you just have to cry, and that's OK. I don't go to baby showers and my loved ones understand and don't get upset with me, but I stopped being quiet about our experiences.

People always seem so shocked when I mention we don't put up a Christmas tree and any gifts we give each other we don't wrap or anything, or wait for Christmas to give. I give my partner his gifts when they are delivered. It's not standard but it's OK. I had a tree about 3 years ago and all it did was make me sad, so we don't do that anymore. That's OK, too. We are different, that's all. But these experiences have a way of changing you and that can be difficult for others to understand sometimes.

I would have been 6 months along around now with my last pregnancy. If all had went well with the others I would have an 8 year old, a 3 year old, and an almost 2 year old this Christmas. It&#39;s just me, my partner, and our dogs, and he has to work for the holidays. Tonight I&#39;ll be at my aunt&#39;s surrounded by a lot of kids, babies, and pregnant women.</p>

<p>It&#39;s always so tough, especially this time of year. My best advice is just to take things one day at a time and never be afraid to take time for yourself when you need it. Some days you just have to cry, and that&#39;s OK. I don&#39;t go to baby showers and my loved ones understand and don&#39;t get upset with me, but I stopped being quiet about our experiences.</p>

<p>People always seem so shocked when I mention we don&#39;t put up a Christmas tree and any gifts we give each other we don&#39;t wrap or anything, or wait for Christmas to give. I give my partner his gifts when they are delivered. It&#39;s not standard but it&#39;s OK. I had a tree about 3 years ago and all it did was make me sad, so we don&#39;t do that anymore. That&#39;s OK, too. We are different, that&#39;s all. But these experiences have a way of changing you and that can be difficult for others to understand sometimes.</p>

<p>I&#39;m sorry you are hurting. I would hug you if I could. I hope you are able to heal and I&#39;m sorry you are here in our little club. You are welcome, it&#39;s just a sad club to be part of. </p>

I had a few specimen jars nearby, I would squat in the empty bathtub every time I needed the toilet or felt something trying to come out. (Yes, I just peed there when necessary, I didn't care.) I would poke around in the mess, pick up any solid bits and place them into a jar, then spray the blood or clots down the drain with the hose attachment.

I've heard of other women using a fine colander over the toilet as their collection method, but if I had to do it again, I'd probably do it the same way I chose. I don't know why, I kind of liked having it all laid out in front of me with no risk of accidental flushing.

It was a vast relief for me to get more information about why I miscarried (trisomy 9), and tbh an odd feeling to incidentally discover the gender (male). Made me feel even more disconnected from the pregnancy, I had been *certain* it was a girl. 

If you manage to collect some chorionic villi or foetal material, you will at least afford yourself some more information. I admit it would have been painful to find out the child was chromosomally normal, but for me that is better than being left completely in the dark.

I had an earlier one a few weeks ago at 9 weeks but the baby was measuring 7w5d. It freaked me out to think that while I was holding my belly at night speaking in my head to my baby it was no longer alive. I thought about what I was doing at 7w5d and wondered at what point in the day did my baby‚Äôs heart stop beating. I thought about the week and a half I had spent not knowing which included thanksgiving and my excitement I had over my little secret felt foolish. We opted for a d&amp;c and I was lucky to have an easy recovery. I think you should share your story, it may be helpful for someone someday and I think it will be cathartic for you. I‚Äôm so grateful for this little corner of the internet. Sending you love and healing vibes ‚ù§Ô∏è</p>

I didn‚Äôt take misoprostol, did the D&C due to partial molar pregnancy, but I have experience with OTC pain management, resulting nausea, and dehydration. I had three tennis ball sized ovarian cysts in a year, one cause ovarian torsion, and fairly constant smaller ones anytime I don‚Äôt take HBC.

Pain causes vomiting, everyone has a different tolerance level. It‚Äôs a vicious cycle, if I vomit I can‚Äôt take pain meds and if I can‚Äôt take pain meds the pain makes me vomit. I‚Äôm totally fine until I reach my level, but there is no coming back OTC after I cross it. Have to wait out the pain without meds, can‚Äôt keep them down.

Here is my prepping for the worst experience plan, based on what I do to attempt to avoid going to the ER for cyst pain unless it‚Äôs really necessary (like when I needed surgery for torsion.)

You can take 800mg of ibuprofen. It‚Äôs a prescription dose and shouldn‚Äôt be taken over a long period of time (days/weeks) because it can cause stomach ulcers. Also, you can take acetaminophen (Tylenol) at the same time as ibuprofen. Do NOT up the dosage of Tylenol, take what the bottle says. Do not take aspirin - it is a blood thinner.

I‚Äôm not certain how long it takes for the miso to start working. I‚Äôd suggest drinking a lot of water in the 24 hours before taking it and having your last meal far enough in advance so that it has time to digest. In the time between, eat things that won‚Äôt be too unpleasant if they come back up.

FIRST, stand on the scale and note your weight. I use this for tracking dehydration. Mild dehydration is the loss of no more than 5 to 6 percent loss of body weight. Loss of 7 to 10 percent is considered moderate dehydration. Severe dehydration (loss of over 10 percent of body weight) is a life-threatening condition that requires immediate medical care. But also consider the speed of weight loss and if you‚Äôre able to drink anything to combat it. Dehydration causes confusion, so it becomes difficult to make a clear decision on ‚Äúshould I go to the ER‚Äù - using weight loss to gauge dehydration helps me.

Take a dose of pain meds before the miso, keeping in mind that it takes up to 20min for them to take effect. The goal with taking both ibuprofen and acetaminophen is to stagger them so that you don‚Äôt have your pain meds wear off. For an easy schedule I take something every 3 hours. So 12pm ibuprofen, 3pm acetaminophen, 6pm ibuprofen, 9pm acetaminophen. But check the med bottle and work out a schedule you feel comfortable with. Set alarms or a timer between doses (husband could keep track.)

In case you need to go to the ER, know which hospitals near you are in network for insurance and check to see if they have the ER wait time listed online. (Checking wait times before going would be a good job for husband. Sometimes it is smarter to drive farther to avoid a packed waiting room.) I put on a pair of stretchy pants then pack chapstick (no fluids before surgery), long phone charger, jacket (even in the summer), and barf bags for the car. Husband should take a jacket too, it‚Äôs most often freezing in there. Call your doctor before you go and let them know you are headed there, especially if you‚Äôre going to their hospital, even if it their office is closed they should have a messaging service.

ALSO - You could start miscarrying before you‚Äôve scheduled taking the meds. Carry your pain meds and pads everywhere. (I did this for cysts.)

I sincerely hope you have an unremarkable experience and simply take a few pain meds. So sorry you have to go through this.",[],,t1_ecdaal6,False,0,[],False,"<div class=""md""><p>I‚Äôm so sorry for your loss. I didn‚Äôt take misoprostol, did the D&amp;C due to partial molar pregnancy, but I have experience with OTC pain management, resulting nausea, and dehydration. I had three tennis ball sized ovarian cysts in a year, one cause ovarian torsion, and fairly constant smaller ones anytime I don‚Äôt take HBC.</p>

<p>Pain causes vomiting, everyone has a different tolerance level. It‚Äôs a vicious cycle, if I vomit I can‚Äôt take pain meds and if I can‚Äôt take pain meds the pain makes me vomit. I‚Äôm totally fine until I reach my level, but there is no coming back OTC after I cross it. Have to wait out the pain without meds, can‚Äôt keep them down.</p>

Depending on how close you are to the person, you could tell them how their words were hurtful. I don't have many friends or family who I could be that honest with, but if you can I think it's ok to let them know.

Planned parenthood doesn&#39;t do abortions beyond I think 19 weeks, don&#39;t remember the exact cut off but we were past it.  We ended up at Family Planning Advocates.

They involve a different set of celebrations than are typically associated with Christmas and, perhaps more importantly, they are centered on rebirth, honoring the cycle of life, death and rebirth that exists across the universe.

If it‚Äôs of any interest I‚Äôd encourage you to look it up - depending  what you search for you may find some Wiccan stuff too but in almost every case the celebrations are based on tradition and old practices and not in conflict with any religious belief (or lack thereof).

&#x200B;

Sorry in advance for what turned out to be an absurdly long post.

&#x200B;

My husband and I are both 31. We started trying to get pregnant in April 2017, and I got my first positive pregnancy test in November 2017. We had been told my husband might have MFI, and we got pregnant the month after our infertility workup. It felt like a miracle. But four months later, the NT scan revealed severe abnormalities, and chorionic villus sampling confirmed a diagnosis of trisomy 18 (we had gotten NIPT, but it hadn't come back yet). My husband and I are both in medicine, so we knew what it meant to be diagnosed with trisomy 18, and we knew we would never want our daughter to suffer like that. We made the heart wrenching decision to end the pregnancy. The procedure ended up getting rescheduled, and she died on her own in the interim. I still feel a little selfish for thinking this, but I'm thankful it ended up happening that way. I like to think that she just fell asleep and didn't wake up. 

&#x200B;

I ended up having my D&E a few days after she died, which ended up being about two weeks after our abnormal ultrasound. Those two weeks were the worst time in our lives. That's when I found this sub. I made an [intro post](https://www.reddit.com/r/ttcafterloss/comments/7tle88/intro_post_advice_on_beginningpreparing_to_cope/) asking for advice, and the outpouring of support was just incredible. I've relied heavily on this sub ever since.

&#x200B;

For several weeks after that, I just threw myself into work and tried to avoid my life as much as possible. I didn't even attempt to start processing things until about 2 months after our loss--before that, it was all just too raw. When I started revisiting those feelings, this sub was a big part of helping me sort through things. I connected with a wonderful community of other moms who had ended wanted pregnancies for medical reasons, and I even met a number of other trisomy 18 moms who have since become close friends (like u/beany_babies). Offline, I started trying to talk to my family more about how I was feeling, and I started seeing a perinatal psychiatrist (who I still see once every couple weeks). I also developed an addiction to the video game Stardew Valley, which was a wonderful distraction (recommended to me by several users on this sub who were similarly helped by it in the aftermaths of their losses).

&#x200B;

It's okay if you don't feel ready to tackle all of these feelings right now. Grief unfolds on different timelines for everyone, and you should give yourself all the time you need. We will all be here for you if and when you'd like to talk. In the meantime, take care of yourself, and be kind to yourself. It's hard not to experience feelings of shame and guilt, even when you know that you lost your baby to something completely random and out of your control. For a long time, I had issues trusting my body even though I know that trisomy 18 is something that happens to completely healthy, fertile people. Honestly, I still have trust issues with my body, although things have improved considerably over the past 11 months.

&#x200B;

I realize I wrote an obscene amount here, but if you'd like to talk more or just have a listening ear in someone who gets it, please feel free to PM me.

tw: current pregnancy

I won't discuss this here, but I wanted you to know that I did get pregnant again and that all is looking good so far (22 weeks today). I got my first period 7 weeks after my D&E, and we started trying right away after that. I got pregnant on our 5th cycle of trying, which surprised me because it took 8 months to get pregnant with our daughter. If it would be helpful to you at any point--now or in the future--I would be happy to talk more about how this pregnancy has gone and how we've approached genetic testing, ultrasounds, etc.

&#x200B;

\*It might seem a little odd that the loss happened so late when trisomy 18 screening is done fairly early in pregnancy. The reasons for this are: 1) our NIPT testing failed the first time, and the repeat draw took almost 3 weeks to result, 2) our NT scan happened at basically the very latest it could possibly happen, at the very end of week 13, and 3) in hindsight, I always add 6 days to the dating that our OB had been using (she had pushed back our due date by 6 days at our first ultrasound, but now I go by LMP because the dating adjustment was almost certainly due to growth restriction).",[],,t1_ec95pwe,False,0,[],False,"<div class=""md""><p>I am so sorry for your profound loss.

I think I'm only going to do OPKs this cycle. Fact of the matter is OPKs have always been a good indicator of when I'm about to ovulate, I've confirmed ovulation with temping almost every single time I've tracked with OPKs, so I'm just going to go with that for this cycle. Also I can't get my serial number for Ovusense to work and I don't like sticking it up my vag every night and fishing it out every morning. 

Current projections have me ovulating January 1st or 2nd, which I feel good about. I'm determined to make 2019 the year of abundance for me especially after 2018 has been such shit. Plus, if we actually (finally) successfully make a baby this cycle, I don't have to move on to fertility drugs. 

My dad's bypass surgery is tomorrow, so I don't think I'm going to be sleeping very well tonight. I'm really hoping everything goes so well it's almost boring for the surgeon.

I told my acupuncturist that temping had been stressing me out (I stopped as soon as I became pregnant in October and didn't start again after my loss until I'd had a period) and she said to let her worry about the temps, which I managed for about half this cycle.

I don't even think I'm pregnant (both of my previous pregnancies have come with increased fatigue before a bfp and I don't have that) so I'm not sure why I'm so annoyed about bad temps except that I'm not confident I ovulated and I feel like these wonky temps won't tell me anything.

This sub's main purpose is for discussion of TTC and pregnancy loss so self posts about subsequent (""rainbow"") pregnancies can be upsetting to members who are still trying. If you are currently pregnant but worried, or going through a questionable loss, the Results thread is still the place for you.

Sorry for the long link I'm on my mobile.

I also thought of this one with your story of someone who had problems so far after there surgery. This is the only study I've found which actually notes that the risks might not plateau after a certain period of time. ""Observational research also suggests an adverse effect of long interpregnancy interval on maternal outcome"", is what I'm specifically referring to in the study. 

So based off that, the huge differences in recommendations, and the way many of the risks associated with women with short intervals between c sections are those who enter labor, I'm almost ready to say risk it. January will mark 6 months, and conceiving (it least for me) takes time. I don't want a vbac. I just want a healthy baby.

Re: thermometers

Mine is specifically for BBT, and it took me about a week to figure out that I just didn't stick it in my mouth and take a quick temperature.  

I had to leave it in at least until it beeped once (20 seconds), and even better, a second beep (5 minutes).  I think it took regular readings during the time interval, and then returned an average. 

Not sure what your thermometers are like, but it's something to check.  

It would also be a good data point to know how much the new thermometer varies during consecutive readings.  Maybe your old thermometer is just really unreliable/variable.  But if different readings 30s apart happens with both, then that points to a different explanation....  ",[],,t1_ec4tmp2,False,0,[],False,"<div class=""md""><blockquote>

Everyone else seems to have no problem even if they are completely undeserving, so why us?</p>

<p>Have you talked to your doctor about your concerns - both fertility and depression related?</p>

<p>Commiseration and many hugs ‚ù§Ô∏èüíú</p>

I forgot how much waiting is involved in WTT and TTC, so I&#39;m trying to emotionally prepare for a lot more waiting. I&#39;m still spotting, but just a little bit randomly each day. How long does it normally take for your body to begin the rebound process enough for sex to be safe/fun again? </p>

I was prescribed misoprostol each time. It doesn't work for me. It worked during my second miscarriage. I took two rounds this weekend and I actually stopped bleeding.

My son was born alive, natural birth at 38+5 and died less than an hour later due to what we now know were preventable birth injuries, which had nothing to do with me physically. I switched care providers immediately after his death. My OB told me that for ‚Äúnormal‚Äù natural live births, the textbook recommendation is 6 months, ensuring all your hormones, bone density, calcium levels, prolactin, etc. go back to non-pregnant ranges. Basically, she made the point that it‚Äôs ideal for your body to reset with supported science. She also told me it wouldn‚Äôt hurt me to get pregnant sooner than 6 months. I know other women personally who didn‚Äôt wait, after both stillbirth, live birth, and D&Cs. I waited the text book amount to resume TTC just to be safe. Good luck in your journey and hope peace finds you along the way!

My son was born alive, natural birth at 38+5 and died less than an hour later due to what we now know were preventable birth injuries, which had nothing to do with me physically. I switched care providers immediately after his death. My OB told me that for ‚Äúnormal‚Äù natural live births, the textbook recommendation is 6 months, ensuring all your hormones, bone density, calcium levels, prolactin, etc. go back to non-pregnant ranges. Basically, she made the point that it‚Äôs ideal for your body to reset with supported science. She also told me it wouldn‚Äôt hurt me to get pregnant sooner than 6 months. I know other women personally who didn‚Äôt wait, after both stillbirth, live birth, and D&amp;Cs. I waited the text book amount to resume TTC just to be safe. Good luck in your journey and hope peace finds you along the way!</p>

There might be a slight drop off but it doesn&#39;t get really hard until later.  And 30 is young.  Personally, I am so glad a got to both live my 20s and get established in my career before having my daughter at 33.  She was hard, worth it, but hard. She changed everything.

In my case, I have a 17% chance of the same thing happening again with the placenta - they don‚Äôt really know why it happens but the research suggests it has a high reoccurrence rate - all we can do is try again and submit to extra monitoring (every 4 weeks after 20 weeks however they have said they will scan as often as I want so I may opt to do a couple more).

<p>For instance, I typically have a 12 day luteal phase. So in my case, I should technically subtract 17 not 18. If you have a 14 day luteal phase, you should be subtracting 19 not 18. Based on that alone, I&#39;m not sure I trust the results of that study.</p>

<p>I also wish I had been more clear with what I needed. Not in a pushy way, just when people asked, I wish I had told them what I needed instead of focusing on not being an inconvenience. </p>

<p>I‚Äôm still in a pretty rough headspace, so I feel like I‚Äôm blathering on like an idiot. Mostly just know that however you feel is okay, and whatever you need is okay. If you ever need to talk or have questions at all feel free to PM me! Good luck tomorrow!</p>

I was diagnosed MTHFR. 

So, essentially... Not all MTHFR variants are equal. There are a few different variants you can have. 

**Heterozygous A1298C** (one copy of A129C) hasn't been shown to cause any issues. **Homozygous A1298C** is two copies of A1298C, also hasn't been shown to cause many, if any issues. 

**Heterozygous C677T** (one copy of C677T) and **Homozygous C677T** (two copies of C677T) *have* been proven to affect homocysteine levels in the body. 

There is also **Compound Heterozyous MTHFR** where you have one copy each of C677T and A1298C. Compound heterozygous MTHFR can also affect homocysteine. This is considered the most ""severe"" of the MTHFR variants. 

Homocysteine levels can affect blood clotting and *this* is why there may be a link between MTHFR and miscarriage. 

This is why it's important to know which variation of MTHFR you have. Because if you have one or two copies of A1298C, it is of little consequence and unlikely to be the cause of any issues. If you have one or two copies of C677T, it may be worthwhile to have your blood homocysteine levels checked. If they are high, there are things that your doctor will suggest to lower them. Similarly, I'd highly recommend having these levels checked if you have compound MTHFR. I have compound MTHFR and even then, my homocysteine levels came back completely normal.

Please let me know if you have any questions and I‚Äôll be happy to help in any way ‚ù§Ô∏è

<p>Question: Were you TTC this month? I had light brown-pinkish spotting 5 days before my period was due and later discovered another pregnancy (implantation bleeding). This was the cycle after I had an assisted miscarriage with misoprostel. On the other hand after my D&amp;C I had some mild spotting a week after I ovulated and it continued until I had actual bleeding from my period starting about 6 days later. And that period was very, very heavy and lasted a long time.

Luckily I haven't had anyone diminish our loss, and I hope the same for you. If anything it is only me who has given me a hard time. I feel dumbfounded that I can feel so much over something I only knew about for 2 weeks. I never expected to grieve like this if something happened so early. I didn't understand. 

Almost everyone has been very supportive. There have been some people whose remarks or comments weren't that great, but I know they were coming from a place of love and it made me feel better anyway. There was also my MIL who tried to ask me about some Christmas ornaments less than 48 hours later. I lost my shit on her and haven't talked to her since. It's very sad but unfortunately my MIL & FIL have never been very supportive thru anything difficult or uncomfortable. I usually ignore this and just move on, keeping my distance but I couldn't hold it in this time. This was really the only negative, literally everyone else who knew or who I've told has been great, including my boss and coworkers. 

For me every day is different. I will have a great day where I feel good and feel like I'm moving on, and then the next I'll be a wreck. I've been on a roller coaster of emotions I didn't know existed. 

The only advice I can give you, that's helped me, is to try and be honest with your feelings and let them come. Lots of crying, lots of sharing stories online and comforting others. Lots of hugs and reaching out to people despite feeling like an emotional burden.

I&#39;m going to have to believe it&#39;s still not totally ready to cary a baby yet. </p>

Those who we know have gone through a struggle (whether identical to ours or polar opposite) to get their babe are seemingly like us. We appreciate their pain and recognise that they are maybe &#39;deserving&#39;, whereas those it comes easy for (both TTC and pregnancy) are to me, somewhat ungrateful and unaware of the blessing they&#39;ve been given (multiple times!). Sure, I&#39;m glad they don&#39;t know the pain - but that&#39;s just it... they don&#39;t know the pain and sometimes I wish they knew just so they could appreciate what they&#39;ve been given.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t know how to explain it but want you to know that you are NOT alone. </p>

I‚Äôm also a club advisor for the language I teach, so the kids expect a holiday party, so I know what you mean about not wanting to be involved in celebrations. My husband and I are also hosting a Christmas party and I‚Äôd really like to just not be here for it.</p>

<p>Big hugs to you. üíï </p>

This is not the time to worry about others. Yes, it must be terrible for a mother to see her child suffer and to have lost her grandchild. But you have enough to deal with and she needs to find somebody else to support her, it can‚Äôt be you. 
I‚Äôm sure your loss brings back memories of her own as well but that is not your problem to deal with.
My advice would be to clearly communicate your needs. She may and most likely does have nothing but good intentions. She may just want to be there for you and help you. Tell her that‚Äôs not what you need. Tell her what you need is time to grieve. Tell her you feel most comfortable doing that by yourself/ with your husband.
There may be things that she can do that may be helpful to you and her. They don‚Äôt have to involve a visit. It can be small but meaningful things like mentioning your son‚Äôs name, lighting a candle for him...
You can also tell her if there are things you don‚Äôt like. Such as her canceling Christmas. She doesn‚Äôt need to change anything but it doesn‚Äôt mean you can‚Äôt tell her what would make you feel better.
Communicate with her as much as you want to- or as little. Texting/ whatsapp may be easier than phone calls since you can write/ answer when it feels right for you.

He can't seriously expect me to go through tiny baby clothes until I'm pregnant and know the sex of the baby. I'll have to go through them again if I do it now (if we have a boy, I'd be donating a lot of stuff). And it would just make me so sad.

I was so frustrated that I said &quot;Yeah, I&#39;d been planning on going through them when I found out the gender of our baby, but finding out he&#39;d be dead instead of wearing them put a damper on that.&quot; And of course his dad was right around the corner with our daughter, which was super awkward. He can&#39;t seriously expect me to go through tiny baby clothes until I&#39;m pregnant and know the sex of the baby. I&#39;ll have to go through them again if I do it now (if we have a boy, I&#39;d be donating a lot of stuff). And it would just make me so sad.</p>

<p>Sorry, this was crazy long. I&#39;m just feeling emotionally worn out and I&#39;m tired of my body not working.</p>

My wife had seven miscarriages. First at 23, last at 25. Perfect blood results. She ended up needing blood thinners to carry to term. This may be something you can ask your doctor about.

<p>I think this cycle, while it&#39;s very long, is the first good cycle I&#39;ve had! I&#39;m back on track. You will be too, but the wait is just frustrating. </p>

<p>Give yourself all of the time you need and grieve however you need to grieve. This is a different experience for all of us, but we have all lost something significant. This is an amazing community.</p>

I 100% understand that primal NEED to be pregnant right away. I feel like I already have that feeling and I still am pregnant. I hope you get your wish soon. 

I appreciate the heads up about the emotional crash as well as the f*d up periods. What fun! I hope your body feels normal again soon, and you feel recovered, and that none of us have this experience ever again. <3

I wish I had known that I'd spend a decent amount of time alone. That I would have to verbalize why I was there. That some nurses, initially, might not know the situation. I wish someone had mentioned that the laminaria insertion would be fairly uncomfortable, and I would cry because that was it. The whole process was upsetting, honestly. You very well may not have this experience, but I was in an incredible amount of pain before going in for the procedure because the opening of my cervix sent me into labor. The contracting of my uterus caused painful GI issues that lasted about a month after. 

The biggest thing I wish I would have known is that the pain isn't over once the baby is gone. There's a hormone crash about two weeks later. Then you'll get a period and that is so offensive because it just shoves your pain right back into your face on a daily basis. I am sad whenever I drink or eat deli meat. All of the things that remind me I'm not pregnant give me this painful twinge in my chest. 

It's been a slow healing process with plenty of steps back along the way. Right now I'm hung up on needing to be pregnant before my due date comes, but I know it's such an arbitrary deadline and I'm working hard to settle my expectations. Just be prepared for a lot of confusing feelings. 

This is month three for me. My last two cycles were totally screwed up, so be ready to be patient with your body. 

It will be hard, but you will make it through this.
