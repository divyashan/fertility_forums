Yep. And I will never be the ""before"" again. This experiences changes you irrevocably forever.  There is who you once were, and who you are now. It's like having a veil of innocence removed from your face.

Yep. I have unfollowed so many people from my social media. Seeing them pregnant/happy with their babies, children is like a knif ethat slowly twists my heart.

My friendships have changed in ways I didn't think was possible. My best friend got pregnant within a month of my loss with her second, also with a boy. Knives. We've not had the same relationship since she told me she was expecting. She decided to tell me in public at a friend's birthday party where I lost my shit and started bawling. I thought the way she told me was so very insensitive and she didn't even give me the decency of privacy when I'd been baring my soul to her about my loss. My other friend had her baby a month after mine died - we were always so close up until this happened. We rarely speak now. I can't do it. Emotionally, it's too hard for me.

No one understands this pain. It is so very isolating. And people stop talking about it or forget you had a child which is so very insensitive. Fuck them. 

It is not fair and it's painful and it sucks so hard. 

Sending you a great big hug.

Have you considered joining a local support group for stillbirth/loss? Are you seeing a bereavement counselor? 

Grief sometimes is ""lighter"" some days for me but when it's bad, I crumble. One thing I've learned is the pain - the hole you feel that is missing/that void - it never goes away.

<p>I have a very distinct feeling I&#39;ll get a negative test. I&#39;m trying my best to set myself up for that, but I can&#39;t help but hope it&#39;ll be positive. And of course the negative test will depress me. </p>

<p>In other news I had some terrible nightmares about having to hang around a bunch of the friends I know who had babies recently and how happy they were. Plus making me hold their babies. I woke up gasping for air. I think I actually managed to have a panic attack in my sleep. I love how only in our world can holding cute babies be considered a nightmare...</p>

I am SO grateful he is so involved, I am so grateful my (hopefully) child will have a father (how fucked up is that) but he is making me incredibly anxious right now.  Then I feel like a bitch because I should be relishing this with him and I can&#39;t.  </p>

<p>I have a doctors appt on Friday, husband wants to go to one of those ultrasound places to find out gender after the appt--then do our reveal the following Friday.  The only reason I agreed because I have a doctors appt and if something is wrong, I&#39;ll find out at the doctors--not some random ass ultrasound place. </p>

Combine that with my husband having no libido, and here we are. But we've gotten pregnant every time we've actively tried! We'll see.

I only feel myself ovulate about 75-80% of the time on my right side, and I didn't this month. And my mucus was hard to read because of all the saline flushing me out, so who knows. I've never not ovulated on day 12 since I've been off the pill and paying attention, but with our luck, this would be the month I wouldn't.

Neither of us is super concerned about not getting pregnant this month. I had such a good time rock climbing outside for the first time and want to push myself to do better in the gym. I'm not huge into it, but two of my good friends are, and having to take breaks to be pregnant and miscarry has been frustrating when they're both so fun and supportive when I go with them.

The sonohysterogram went well. It was my second one (I had one after my miscarriage/termination in January as well).

The good news is that the position of the huge one (~10.5cm) won't interfere with a pregnancy at all.

So I did. And then in the middle of the night, I woke up feeling hungover... but also, something else. My boob hurt. I turned to my husband and said, ""I'm pregnant. I shouldn't have had that wine."" And he told me I was crazy and there was no way I was pregnant, my test had been negative, etc etc etc. I uneasily went back to sleep, but woke up the next morning, peed on the remaining pregnancy test, and sure enough there was a total squinter of a line there. My husband didn't see it but I did. I felt such a broad mix of emotions-- anxiety and guilt-- both over all the wine I had had the night before and a whole bunch of irrational feelings about betraying my firstborn. It took months for those to dissipate but as I saw her growing excitement over my belly and the prospect of a new baby, my confidence in my ability to parent two small children grew and so did my excitement. I could not have been less prepared to go to the hospital in labor only to be told that my baby had died inside me, without my even knowing.

The other day my daughter and I were playing with play doh and she asked me to make a baby. So I did. She held it and asked if it was Sam. I said sure. She was so sweet with this little handful of play doh. She ""fed"" it a play doh pancake that she had made. Her tenderness with this little play doh baby stiffened my resolve to keep trying for a baby every cycle until it happens. She's a wonderful big sister and she'll be amazing with a new baby, whenever we are fortunate enough to bring one home.

So much of what you said and what you're going through resonated with me in my own life-- the yearning for a new pregnancy, the exhaustion and heartbreak of seeing other happy families, the sadness of feeling like you and your baby are being forgotten as time moves forward.

As far as tackling some of the issues you brought up in your post-- that list of things to share with loved ones about what to say and what not to say is a really great start.

When dealing with triggers-- I wonder if you have brought this up with your therapist and whether they have helped you formulate some tools and plans to deal with many of the triggers in ways that work for you? If not, that might be the ideal place to start since they know you and your specific triggers and can help identify some workarounds. Otherwise my best advice is to do what you can to avoid the triggers you can while they affect you so much-- feel no guilt about turning down baby shower invitations, passing on family picnics, pretending you don't even see that baby in the grocery store... whatever tricks work for you are okay to utilize. 

For me, TTC is the most beneficial thing for my mood and emotions-- it skyrockets my anxiety around ovulation and when my period is due, but I also have a positive thing to focus on and work toward achieving, and that has been incredibly healing for me. I hope that once you actively start trying, you can also find a modicum of comfort in the fact that you are actively working towards the goal of growing your family. Of course all the feelings are complicated, but ultimately having a positive goal has been helpful and uplifting-- it has altered my grief and transformed it into this overpowering desire to do everything I can to increase my odds of having another baby. 

Again, I'm so sorry. I wish I had better advice and more insight-- but this group has been a very wonderful place to muddle through all this shit every day.

I know they don't mean to, but I feel the intense need to protect myself emotionally. 

As for the triggers, I try and remove myself from any I can control. I blocked people on social media who are pregnant and those with babies or small children. If I'm walking around and see a pregnant woman or small baby I physically look away. I keep my eyes forward if I pass a shop with baby clothes in the window. It's not much, and probably not the best advice but it's all I can do. I haven't had to have a discussion with anyone about their pregnancies or babies yet luckily as I'm still not back at work and not seeing more than a handful of people socially. I'm sure the time will come. I think I'm going to try and be fairly honest and tell those who know about my loss that while I'm happy for them, I find it difficult to talk about ""healthy"" (they're only healthy until they're not!) pregnancies and babies. It might not work, but I try and come up with a plan for any situation that will be triggering.

Every time I think we are turning a corner, we hit another wall.  Here's the breakdown of what has happened.  D&C done June 8, got a visual exam two weeks after where they said everything looked good, I should get my period 2-4 weeks from then.  4 weeks goes by, I'm getting positive HCG tests, no signs of a period.  I call and express concern over my lack of cycle.  They say ""oh actually, it might be 8-10 weeks, just wait it out.""  

I was another 2 weeks, thought maybe I O'ed during then but not sure because pee tests for HCG and LH are still positive.  I called and tell them I am NOT getting a period still, wtf is happening.  They schedule me to see the OB Aug 10.  Aug 9 I start light brown spotting, mention it during the appointment the next day, OB sees the spotting, decided to order some betas.

First beta on Aug 14 is 27, they think I am newly pregnant (trololol), next beta on Aug 16 is 21, wait maybe I'm not newly pregnant (duh).  Third beta on Aug 24 is 27, what is happening?  Get an ultrasound on Aug 25, they find a ""mass with bloodflow"" not in my tubes, but deep in the uterine muscle tissue.  It's an emergency situation, they say, go to the ER stat and get methotrexate, I have an ectopic pregnancy.  Day of dose beta is 29.

Day 4 beta is drawn Mon Aug 28, it's 27.  Go back for day 7 beta on Aug 31.  They call me Sept 1 and tell me the beta is 22.9 and while it is in the 15%+ range of a drop, they can't say MTX actually worked and now they think it's not ectopic, it's retained tissue from the D&C and want to do a second D&C after my next beta which is scheduled for this upcoming Tuesday.

I am fucking livid.  These idiots NEVER bothered to make sure the first D&C really got everything out until I had TWICE called expressing concern 2 months later.  They then declared an emergency ectopic pregnancy situation and dosed me with MTX only to now backpedal and say maybe that was unnecessary and I need a second D&C????  Seriously fuck these people.  I'm going to get the beta Tuesday, then see them that afternoon at an appointment where they want me to sign the consent forms for the D&C.  I am not. signing. shit.  except to transfer my records to a new provider.  I don't think they really know what it is that is producing HCG and not leaving my body.  I don't trust that if they go in there, I won't be another two months before hearing ""oh whoops, we didn't get it all out AGAIN!""  I will get a procedure if it is 100% the last option, but I will NOT have these morons do it.  It's been FIVE MONTHS since the last period I had and I just want to punch people.

It's also our first wedding anniversary on Monday and instead of being happy and excited this weekend I am angry, confused, and sexually frustrated because they were adamant about us not doing it til my HCG is 0.  I literally hate them.  My only hope is that my beta on Tues is low enough I can tell them to fuck off before changing hospitals/practices.  >:[",[],,t1_dmh4ha6,False,0,[],False,"<div class=""md""><p>Warning:  Wall of text ahead.</p>

<p>Of course... if I get pregnant this cycle all of that will be moot anyways, because I&#39;ll be pregnant and this won&#39;t be such a huge concern. </p>

I've had to cut off a few friends and acquaintances who are pregnant/have had babies. As others have said, this horrible thing that's happened to us has had such a deep impact on our lives that relationships are bound to be affected. I don't think it's wrong to cut ties to protect your feelings. If you did feel like explaining your feelings to your friend, you could, depending on how you feel she'll take it. It might not be worth it. If you don't think that kind of conversation would go down well, I don't think that there's anything wrong with distancing yourself from her. 

A work colleague had her baby on my boy's due date. That stung so much. I think she totally gets why I can't really speak to her. She told my partner (we work at the same company, she's in his team) that she blocked us from seeing her posts for a while because she totally understood that seeing pregnancy/baby things would be horrific for us. I wish more people had that kind of understanding. I'd totally blocked her from Facebook in advance of her doing this, but I actually appreciated the gesture. I think a lot of people might think we're bitter and irrational and should just be happy for other pregnancies and babies. 

I saw a Facebook post about a Pampers advert aired in the UK about NICU babies with a song called ""we're going home"" (or something like that) playing, and how one family contacted the company to say how upset they were because they didn't get to bring their baby home. I don't necessarily agree with contacting the company about it because I understand that life goes on and they have to market their products, but anyway...SO many comments said that those with loss should be happy for others. Sure, I am happy for others. I would never wish loss on any other women as it's the single most horrific thing that has happened to me. At the same time I'm extremely envious of those women. Seeing babies and pregnant women for me is triggering and seriously affects my mental health at the moment. I don't think people really understand that part of our losses. If we have to lose friendships over it, even temporarily, I'd say it's worth the emotional wellbeing it gives us (because we sure as fuck have been through enough, right?)

I don't really have any words of wisdom regarding the spiritual part of your post as I was raised agnostic/atheist.

I think it's good that you're taking the pills. I waited almost two weeks to miscarry naturally and ended up having to use the medication anyway. My advice for you today is to give yourself something to distract you from the pain (emotional and physical) as you go through the physical miscarriage tonight. Has your doctor prescribed pain killers that you can take?

I took the cytotec last year on Oct 31st and my husband held me while we watched a stupid Halloween movie. He walked with me, holding my shoulders, every time I went to the bathroom to change the pad. We knew for sure when the baby had passed and after that the cramps started diminishing. It was definitely one of the worst nights of my life. But I felt my husband's love SO strongly that night as he tried to support me even though there was nothing he could really do.

It took longer than I expected to heal, but I can say now that I am OK. Wishing you the best tonight. <3",[],,t1_dmfglsf,False,0,[],False,"<div class=""md""><p>I&#39;m so sorry for your loss.

Same. Ironically, I have a friend who had a baby 2 weeks after my son died and I get on with her fine. I think it's because she was there for me and never said an asshole thing. The friends I've pushed away have been ones who I felt were insensitive (like this one with how she announced it to me - not even giving me the decency of privacy) - and another one who said she'd hang out and never did (in the midst/early part of my grief - the invited me to her baby shower! Which I declined) - and another friend who was pregnant same time as me - entire pregnancies together who seemed to just disappear and was not very ""there for me"" when it happened. These 3 people - did something that has caused me to not want to engage with them. And o course, they are all either with a new child or pregnant and expecting. It is like a further stab on top of the one I already have.

> She's been nothing but supportive and sweet. But I can't stand to get texts from her, if she comments on unrelated Instagram I get sick to my stomach.

I know this feeling. I blow my pregnant friend off all the time or send a one word text or bitmoji but I don't feel ""joy"" when I message her. It's just PAIN. 

> She did nothing to deserve it, but sadly I think our relationship is irreparably changed anyhow. 

Ugh. So sad.

Maybe that's what I need to accept.

I felt betrayed at how she chose to do this w hen I was sharing everything with her. it was going to hurt no matter what, but how she told me and me feeling I was one of the last to know gutted me during an already fucked up time. I haven't seen her since and cancelled when we were going to hang out. I can't see pregnant people without wanting to die. She is of course, pregnant with a boy, by an ex who is not someone anyone should be happy to procreate with and was essentially stalking her. Will our relationship survive this? I don't know. I haven't been able to like any of her sonogram pics on social media, baby things - it all seems like as stab directly to my heart. She was so supportive my entire pregnant and when baby died, but the way she told me still feels like knives slowly cutting me all over my body. Anyone else dealing w/ this? 

Also, I drove by the Catholic church this morning and flipped it off. It was like a ""F-you"" to God. Bedcause I thought, you didn't protect my baby. Why does everyone else get to have their child around me and was worth saving/protecting/being brought into this world and mine died right at the finish line with no cause ever found?

I've had such a change in my faith since this happened. Where I once had a very strong faith (I'm not religious, but spiritual), it is gone. Prayer no longer comforts me. That same friend posted that her son was in an accident but luckily was ok and everyone told her ""Thank GOD."" and ""GOD protected him.""

I had read that people in this situation re: faith either grow closer to theirs or farther apart. I feel the latter.

Then I felt worse, eventually had to run to the bathroom and ended up with diarrhea - at the same time I really had to throw up. Eventually made it to the sink to vomit all the soup I had earlier.

Felt like she just dropped all the way down and was about to fall out and at the same time it felt like I got a braxton hicks contraction, everything sort of hardened there. I managed to finish vomiting and went to lie down and I kid you not the baby totally had dropped - the shape of my belly was very different than in the weeks/days/hours preceding. I even took a photo and it looked so weird... like I looked super skinny until belly bottom and then a tiny bundled ball there. Thankfully, thanks to the doppler I was able to hear her heartbeat.

The night was the same - even drinking 2 sips of water made me super nauseous.  So this morning I peed the darkest almost-brown colored urine ever. It was gross and scary.

So far today I'm not feeling much better but didn't throw up yet. I armed myself with anti-vomiting med, b6, rehydrating powder and powerade and hope that it will help at least a bit.

I have multiple uterine fibroids, including some pretty large ones (5+ cm). As PlouPloup83 said, whether they will interfere with conception and/or pregnancy depends much more heavily on where they are located than on how large they are. Mine are mostly on the outside of my uterus, and my doctors have all told me they won't interfere with conception or growing a baby (but will likely interfere with delivery, although that's really just an unfortunate coincidence in my case). At the advice of my RE, I met with the surgeon who will eventually remove mine, and he said that since they wouldn't interfere, it was better to wait on removal. Otherwise I'd be benched for at least 6 months waiting for my uterus to heal before I could TTC again. My suggestion would be to consult with an OB to see what they think - they might send you for more imaging (I had a saline sonogram and an MRI to look at mine) and possibly to a surgeon for a consult, but they should be able to give you a good idea of whether they'll interfere. (Trigger warning: we went ahead with TTC without removal and are now at 13 weeks, so the docs were right so far).

""Taking Charge of Your Fertility"" is a great place to start for learning about charting, OPKs, etc., and the sub r/tryingforababy can be a great source of practical information about everything from learning to temp, to how to get started with an RE if you decide to go that route. r/stilltrying is also really helpful - not the right place to ask basic temping questions, but if you decide to take the step to see an RE, you'll find lots of support there and plenty of helpful advice about what kinds of questions to ask, what to expect, etc.

I think it would have been better for them to have told you before their son was born so you had time to emotionally prepare for it. But what's done is done. :(

I have those doom feelings alllll the time! Like you said it helps to ""listen"" to them but don't let them take control...we have to acknowledge them to let them pass. I'm pretty sure everyone in this sub has these feelings, like they will never have a living child, why did this happen to them, etc. I have these thoughts a few times a day, but most days they're quiet, unless I see a trigger like a living baby or a pregnant relative/friend.

I used to try to grieve like other people.....I tried to find a balance but I feel like I listened too much to others' stories and tried to emulate how they grieve. A lot of people are more outwardly emotional than I am, and I thought just because I focus on positive things by default and don't cry as much, that I'm doing something wrong. Don't put so much pressure on yourself to get the ""proper"" way to grieve. You will grieve Julia in your own way and that's enough. Like you said, doing whatever you can handle is enough. Sometimes you won't be able to feel all the feelings, and sometimes they will just overpower you in a gigantic wave of grief. And that's okay. Just be kind to yourself üíï

My son dies ten days before his due date and almost one year later I am stuck with a possible problem getting pregnant. WTF. 

Thanks, universe. Screw you too.

I&#39;ve started taking a folate prenatal as well because I just found out my mom has the homozygous mthfr mutation and now I have to get tested. Not to mention October is coming and I still am not pregnant, so that&#39;s going to hit hard.</p>

<p>It just feels like the last couple months have been conspiring to tell me that maybe I&#39;m just not supposed to be having a baby.</p>

<p>I think we&#39;re just going to focus on my real fertile week for a couple months and if it still doesn&#39;t happen I&#39;ll probably go in to my GYN for testing since January puts us at a year anyways.</p>

Be incredibly gentle with yourself and each other, and know that grief is a highly personal thing you can not share sometimes. When that happens, know that that is OK and you'll find each other again.

Grief comes in all different shapes and forms, and changes constantly. Keep making room for it, and you'll eventually be able to find a new normal. But that will take a while and in the meantime - take every minute as it comes.

It's been about 5 months since my D&C for my missed miscarriage and I still get stuck in memories sometimes. They're getting a little less painful and I'm getting a little better at processing the feelings but I still have occasional really bad days. I'm pretty sure my next ultrasound will be traumatic as far as flashbacks go, even though it won't even be a pregnancy ultrasound (I've only had the one really bad one and I'm pretty sensitive to seeing ultrasound images still). I have a therapist who specializes in infertility and loss, and she has been pretty helpful. I'd recommend therapy to anyone struggling with a loss.

For me it's easier to tell that I'm doing better when I look at other things in my life. Right after the loss I had a very short fuse for minor irritations (like I flipped the fuck out when I accidentally dropped a bowl of cat food). I don't have that problem anymore. I'm also getting better at focusing at work and sleeping and exercising.

I'm still sad when I think about the loss but it isn't affecting the rest of my life as much as it did initially. If that makes sense?

I would absolutely do the MVA (if god forbid this happens again). I got to the office like a regular visit and they took me right back to a normal room. They had all the instruments covered though, thank goodness. They let my husband be in there with me and hold my hand, they talked me through everything they were doing, but I wore headphones and told hubs to let me know what I needed to. I really didn't want to hear it. They put the regular speculum in, then a couple pricks for the numbing of the cervix which I thought was going to hurt but it was over before I could react. They waited about five minutes for that to hit and after that five minutes that's when I set my timer (they said the procedure itself would take 5 minutes) and put my headphones in. They were done in less than five minutes, I didn't even realize they had started. There was maybe 30 total seconds of pain which was a sharp cramp right above my pelvis, it only came when she inserted and did the aspiration. 

The only thing I took beforehand were 3 ibuprofen. They have me an antibiotic before and one to take 6 hours later at home. But I was fine. Recovery afterwards I didn't feel anything, just light bleeding. The difference with this and the D&C is they don't put you under/knock you out, and there is no scraping which are two things I was happy to avoid. 

The only thing that sucks is they can't see inside so they go by feel. I ended up having a little tissue left over which I passed about a week after the procedure and the cramps from that naturally passing were 10x the pain of the procedure. But, one week and 2 days after the procedure, I just got a negative pregnancy test!! 

The doctor just said nothing in the vagina and no swimming for 2 weeks, which I'm happy to do because I am still bleeding. They said 2-3 weeks of bleeding and minor cramping from the procedure are expected.

I hope this helps and I didn't ramble too much!!

I wanted to let you know that after three losses there is still hope. I lost 2 babies between 5-7 weeks in April and July of last year due to low progesterone. My doctor put me on progesterone supplements to fix the problem and I thought I was pregnant with my miracle baby in December. At 7 weeks I was rushed to the hospital for abdominal pain and what turned out to be an ectopic pregnancy. I lost my baby and my left Fallopian tube. At this point I'd lost three babies and my chances of getting pregnant again were nearly chopped in half. I tried for three long cycles and nothing happened. I was so destroyed and ready to give up since I had long wacky cycles that made no sense and I was so sad. My doctor suggested clomid, so I called his office for a prescription and got it. I took it not expecting anything. I actually was such a sadistic I person at this point that I took it so I could whine more about nothing working right and continue my depressed state bc I didn't want to get attached to (and lose) another baby. After the clomid I ovulated 10 days sooner than I usually do. During my TWW I went to New York City with my husband and some friends on vacation. I came back and took a test at home the next day, gave it to my mom to read and throw away bc I couldn't stand to look at another negative. She said it was positive and I thought she was messing with me in some sort of sick way but there it was. I had been taking my progesterone so my uterine lining was good and my period never came. I went to the doctor and saw a gestation sac AND a heartbeat for the first time ever at 7 weeks. I think until 12 weeks I was convinced I was going to lose this one, and to be honest the anxiety of previous losses still haunts me some times even though it's gotten better. I'm currently 23 weeks with my rainbow baby boy and my husband and parents have all felt him kick from the outside. I'm not going to say that I wouldn't change the losses. They were awful. But I also think that if they hadn't happened then I wouldn't have this baby. He's due on Christmas this year and feeling him kick and hearing his heartbeat is the best feeling in the world. I think my losses will always be a part of me, but I am glad, in retrospect, that I didn't give up. I know how disheartening multiple losses can be because you always think the first one is a fluke and then the second one happens and you get that sinking feeling in your stomach. Take a few cycles off if you need to. Make sure you have people and things in your life that you enjoy through it all. I'm not going to say ""don't give up,"" because that's a personal choice, but if you do give up, don't make that decision when you're irrationally angry. I wish you good luck and lots of strength!

Which probably caused his depression getting so bad. 

Now I'm crying on the couch because every month I get my hopes up. Every month it gets crushed. Every time it stings a bit more.

<p>On the slightly positive side, I survived a week back at work and I had a cider last night for the first time since June. Not exactly great positives but the only ones I can come up with and some are better than none.</p>

I also realized that I might have a bit of post-traumatic stress from my MC.  

Important background: Based on the ultrasound results for my MMC, my LO likely stopped growing during a business trip. I travel a lot for work, but I had a horrible flight on my way to that trip. Despite not being anxious and having a lovely conversation with the woman sitting next to me, my heart starting racing and would not settle down until after we landed. I only was 5 weeks at the time and had not had an OB appointment, so I called my PCP the next day. I missed her call by a few seconds, and she left me a voicemail in which she attributed my heart racing to anxiety from the recent drama with United but told me I could go to urgent care if I wanted. I called her back maybe 15 seconds later, and she already was ""unavailable"" and made her nurse take a message. I felt embarrassed and uncomfortable and didn't want to inconvenience my coworkers by taking our rental care to urgent care, so I just continued on my trip. 

As far as I know, this is a complete coincidence and not remotely causal to why I lost that pregnancy. Still, it was scary and did happen a few days before the LO stopped growing. 

I have had a break from work travel for the last few months but am heading out on Sunday for a week long trip. I currently am in my TWW, so I *could* have an embryo getting ready to implant. I won't know until a day or two after I return from this trip.

I thought that I was doing well emotionally from my MC, but I am finding myself nervous to fly. If I do have a fertilized egg, I want to give it every chance to survive. There's no evidence that flying would be detrimental, so I assume my feelings as more PTSD. The situation just feels too familiar. 

I have a great relationship with the colleague who is leading the travel component of this project, and I know that she struggled with infertility and possibly also MCs. I may have blabbed my fear to her. I may also have blabbed that I am TTC. This is so incredibly TMI for my office. She took it like a champ, but I am a little mortified about how much I shared. Yes, I have a good relationship with her. Yes, she knows about my MC. Did I have to tell her I was TTC? 

Now I am managing my anxiety about the flight and mortification about my big mouth. Awesome.",[],,t1_dm4cj2p,False,0,[],False,"<div class=""md""><p>Well, I think I said something stupid today. I also realized that I might have a bit of post-traumatic stress from my MC.  </p>

<p>Important background: Based on the ultrasound results for my MMC, my LO likely stopped growing during a business trip. I travel a lot for work, but I had a horrible flight on my way to that trip. Despite not being anxious and having a lovely conversation with the woman sitting next to me, my heart starting racing and would not settle down until after we landed. I only was 5 weeks at the time and had not had an OB appointment, so I called my PCP the next day. I missed her call by a few seconds, and she left me a voicemail in which she attributed my heart racing to anxiety from the recent drama with United but told me I could go to urgent care if I wanted. I called her back maybe 15 seconds later, and she already was &quot;unavailable&quot; and made her nurse take a message. I felt embarrassed and uncomfortable and didn&#39;t want to inconvenience my coworkers by taking our rental care to urgent care, so I just continued on my trip. </p>

<p>As far as I know, this is a complete coincidence and not remotely causal to why I lost that pregnancy. Still, it was scary and did happen a few days before the LO stopped growing. </p>

<p>I have had a break from work travel for the last few months but am heading out on Sunday for a week long trip. I currently am in my TWW, so I <em>could</em> have an embryo getting ready to implant. I won&#39;t know until a day or two after I return from this trip.</p>

<p>I thought that I was doing well emotionally from my MC, but I am finding myself nervous to fly. If I do have a fertilized egg, I want to give it every chance to survive. There&#39;s no evidence that flying would be detrimental, so I assume my feelings as more PTSD. The situation just feels too familiar. </p>

I went 9 weeks without a period and scheduled a trip to the OB to see what is going on.  The day before my visit I started some light brown spotting, but no cramps or anything.  She checked me out and ordered a beta.  I went Mon 8/14 for the bloodwork and it came back at 27.  They thought I might be pregnant (trololol) but I didn&#39;t think the timing made sense with anything (though we&#39;ve had sex here and there since we got the clear post-op) and figured it was residual from the MMC.  I went back two days later and it dropped to 21, that was good.  They told me to go back again in a week to see if it gets to 0, so I went yesterday.  They called this morning and it&#39;s 28....

Earlier this year, I miscarried at 7 weeks. It would have been our second child (we have a 19 month old son), and the pregnancy was a surprise (somewhat; we had been using the oh-so-reliable pullout method so there was of course a chance we could get pregnant, although we had been doing that for 7 years and never had any accidents, plus it took us the better part of a year to conceive our first). I felt incredibly guilty after losing the pregnancy because my initial reaction to getting a positive test was, ""oh sh!t."" We knew we wanted a second child but the timing wasn't great. And top of being kind of stressed about that, I whined about not being able to drink all summer. When I started bleeding and knew it was over and I was so, so heartbroken.  This is stupid but part of me felt like I deserved the miscarriage because I wasn't grateful enough. I couldn't stop crying. I also felt guilty being so upset because I have a healthy child already and many do not, and I was only 7 weeks along.

I wanted to jump right back into trying but we ended up waiting due to some issues with timing and my husband's grad school program, and will be trying starting in October. I'm 35 so I'm anxious to get going!

I'm a fairly high-strung person already and after our loss I'm really worried about how I would handle being pregnant again if we are lucky enough to have that happen. I feel like I was sort of blissfully ignorant during my first pregnancy and that definitely will not be the case now. 

Anyway, just wanted to introduce myself. I've been reading many of your stories and while they make my heart hurt so badly I feel less alone.",[],,t1_dm2vt94,False,0,[],False,"<div class=""md""><p>Hi everyone. This is my first post here but I didn&#39;t feel like making a separate intro post. </p>

I felt incredibly guilty after losing the pregnancy because my initial reaction to getting a positive test was, &quot;oh sh!t.&quot; We knew we wanted a second child but the timing wasn&#39;t great. And top of being kind of stressed about that, I whined about not being able to drink all summer. When I started bleeding and knew it was over and I was so, so heartbroken.  This is stupid but part of me felt like I deserved the miscarriage because I wasn&#39;t grateful enough. I couldn&#39;t stop crying. I also felt guilty being so upset because I have a healthy child already and many do not, and I was only 7 weeks along.</p>

<p>I wanted to jump right back into trying but we ended up waiting due to some issues with timing and my husband&#39;s grad school program, and will be trying starting in October. I&#39;m 35 so I&#39;m anxious to get going!</p>

<p>I&#39;m a fairly high-strung person already and after our loss I&#39;m really worried about how I would handle being pregnant again if we are lucky enough to have that happen. I feel like I was sort of blissfully ignorant during my first pregnancy and that definitely will not be the case now. </p>

<p>Anyway, just wanted to introduce myself. I&#39;ve been reading many of your stories and while they make my heart hurt so badly I feel less alone.</p>

Everyone is entitled to TTC in accordance with their own preferences-- temping, OPKs, tracking CM, any/all/none of the above. It's not okay to piss all over someone else's choices.

Same with my husband. We've really struggled in the eight months since we lost our son. I hardly recognize myself at times. I feel like I'm crawling with my head dragging on the ground. And I'm so angry and resentful. 

As far as seeing these parts of yourself that you don't want anymore. We are working on that in my house. Trying to take better care of our health, our eating, making progress on chores a little bit every day even if it's only ten minutes. We have no clear goal of where we want to be simply because the world has a grey tint now. Sure we'd like to be happy, but we don't know what that feels like anymore. We know what it's like to feel not-as-shitty. That's about it. Our peaceful days feel more like sorely needed rest and even then, our grief is with us, sitting on our chests. 

But I have faith from everything I've read that this will pass in time. We will always grieve but it won't be so present, so palpable. I'll be honest that I am pessimistic, mostly out of resentment. Why should I, how can I hope for another beautiful little face. One that breathes, with hands that reach and grasp. Even the thought of it makes me sick to my stomach. Any kind of happiness makes me grimace, knowing it means nothing to anyone but me. Life took my greatest happiness away- it might and will do it again. 

So it's down to faith. Not in any god or mystical force, just in the fundamental belief that what I feel right now is not reality. That I must keep one foot moving in front of the other in order to ever leave this dark place I'm in. I don't know how, but I know it will happen. 

It'll happen for you too sister. Hang in there. <3 

",[],,t1_dm0yq6u,False,0,[],False,"<div class=""md""><p>Major depression and anxiety disorder here. Same with my husband. We&#39;ve really struggled in the eight months since we lost our son. I hardly recognize myself at times. I feel like I&#39;m crawling with my head dragging on the ground. And I&#39;m so angry and resentful. </p>

<p>As far as seeing these parts of yourself that you don&#39;t want anymore. We are working on that in my house. Trying to take better care of our health, our eating, making progress on chores a little bit every day even if it&#39;s only ten minutes. We have no clear goal of where we want to be simply because the world has a grey tint now. Sure we&#39;d like to be happy, but we don&#39;t know what that feels like anymore. We know what it&#39;s like to feel not-as-shitty. That&#39;s about it. Our peaceful days feel more like sorely needed rest and even then, our grief is with us, sitting on our chests. </p>

My midwife put me on Zoloft last Thursday, at my request because I felt my anxiety was getting a little bit unmanageable and wanted another tool in my tool belt to address it. But ever since I started it, I haven't been sleeping. Like, maybe a couple hours at a time intermittently throughout the night, but certainly nothing resembling a good night's sleep. This is just giving me a new set of things to be anxious about, even if it is otherwise beneficial. 

I called the midwife today and spoke to a different one than my usual one-- she suggested to cut the dose in half for a few days. If that helps, then great. If not, I can keep weaning from there until I can stop completely in another week or so. That seems like a pragmatic approach so I'm happy to give it a go, but I'm just frustrated that this has to be this challenging at all.

I'm so tired now. My toddler is a very bad sleeper, which for the most part I am adapted to, but this week it has been brutal because it seems like she wakes me just a few minutes after I finally manage to fall asleep and so the cycle repeats, and with this limited amount of sleep under my belt I'm just not caring for her adequately during the day-- I have anxiety about driving, for example, because I'm so sleep deprived, so I just want to be off this med ASAP because I need sleep. Having a toddler who sleeps poorly also means that I'm not comfortable adding sleep aids to the cocktail of meds I'm already taking-- I just can't be unconscious for 8 hours straight, I need to be able to both wake up to address her needs and fall asleep again after I've settled her back in.

After the midwife and I discussed dosing options, she asked me if I am seeing a counselor, because she was just reading through my patient notes and knows I am going through a lot. I was feeling emotionally stable today until we touched on this-- I know what a shitshow my chart is. I was unprepared to discuss anything but my medication, so this caught me off guard and I started crying and have just been throwing myself a pity party ever since. Also, this is a thing that is brought up by every midwife I've happened to see at this practice ever since my stillbirth. I understand that they're just covering their ass and making sure someone is on the case for all this crazy that I'm hauling around, but my therapist almost feels like my get out of jail free card with the midwife-- like I can get whatever medical treatment I'm asking for as soon as I ensure them I am seeing someone. Why can't they just write that on top of my chart, so we don't have to wade into that every single time?

Also, I was put in touch with a woman who had a full term stillbirth literally one day before me. She started trying this month and found out she is pregnant again yesterday. I am really and truly happy for her-- I know how hard the past three months have been for her and I know how important the idea of a new pregnancy is right now. But that doesn't overshadow my feelings of envy. I've been trying for three months and my cycles are just so effed up! Why can't my body get it together? I know it's not a race, but it just made me feel anxious about my own timeline. I want to be pregnant right now and don't even know if my body can do that.

The bigger one looks fabulous - measuring right on track, put on a whole dance show for us. I&#39;ve finally got my official dating of 9w5d, which gives a due date of March 23. I also got my doctor to agree to no later than 36 weeks, with daily non-stress tests or even admittance for twice daily non-stress tests before that point. She doesn&#39;t seem to think I&#39;ll get to 36 weeks, though. </p>

<p>The twin that didn&#39;t make it measured at about 7w5d, and had no heart beat. It will hopefully just be reabsorbed and shouldn&#39;t affect the surviving baby. Unfortunately, I can&#39;t have the NIPT because the deceased baby could have passed away due to chromosome issues that could still show up in my blood. I also have to wait as long as possible to do the combination test because of the same concern about the dead twin affecting the blood results. </p>

I have to admit...I giggled a little bit reading your post title. After our miscarriage, we were on month five of trying and smack dab in the fertile window when my husband got the flu too. The timeline looked like this -

O-4: first fertile day, no problems at first...but husband feels slowly worse throughout the day and has a fever by the evening

O-3: second fertile day, husband still doesn't feel great but manages

O-2: husband collapses in his morning shower and cannot stand up on his own, is slurring his speech, etc. We spend the day in the ER. No fever anymore (to the best of either of our memories) but he's seriously dehydrated and officially diagnosed with the flu. No sex, obviously.

O-1: husband stays home from work to recuperate. If I remember correctly, I whined to him multiple times about how we were losing the best days of our fertile window and he managed a quickie because ""if it works out, it'll be worth it"". 

O: I honestly don't remember, but I think we skipped this day to let him rest again.

Well, that ended up being the month and I'm currently 28 weeks pregnant with a healthy baby boy. Now every time I complain about a symptom, he loves to say, ""you can't blame me - I had the flu!""

None! They found fibroids, which I am already aware of. The ultrasound was transvaginal, but ultrasounds are very triggering for me in general, especially the fact that the fertility clinic is at the same hospital that my son died. In fact, the MFM office is also at the same hospital...so walking in, pregnant or not, is always going to be a gigantic trigger for me. I almost cried during the ultrasound but I tried my best to distract myself.

I asked the RE if they got my blood results back from yesterday. They said they are going to discuss everything with me in a follow up appointment after my HSG: blood results, ultrasound, semen analysis, HSG, etc. I am obviously not pregnant because they didn't notify me. But the nurse seemed....nervous? Maybe I'm just making that up. I probably am, and everything will most likely be fine, but I am anxious to just know everything and spot anything that could possibly be wrong--and fix it.

Hubby is doing sperm analysis sometime this week, I am really pleased with how on board he is with everything! I think going to a Fertility Clinic is really helping me mentally. It makes me feel like I have a little bit of control back in my life, since I'm being proactive and doing all of these things. I'm even checking my BBT every morning now, because my RE wants it, so I'm covering literally everything I can. For me it helps to have as many answers as possible. I can't just sit back and wait for myself to get pregnant again....I need answers, I need to fully understand everything in my body. My husband sees that this is helping my mood, so I think that's why he's so on board (when he wasn't very into the idea of a semen analysis before).

So fingers crossed that my HSG will be comfortable and tolerable next week, and that my follow-up appointment will have good news. And if it doesn't have the greatest news, it's news that comes with a plan to fix things. :)

<p>Many WILL move on to a new protocol after 6 cycles -- usually a mixture of Clomid and FSH. And often do IUIs. But it doesn&#39;t truly mean there is a lifetime max on Clomid.</p>

<p>Also, unfortunately there are definitely doctors who rush to suggest IVF - just because someone is a doctor doesn&#39;t mean they do always have your best interest at heart. Some doctors are not nearly as good as others and I&#39;ve heard way too many stories of people being told to do IVF before they were tested thoroughly. </p>

I would have to say that SOME doctors DO rush to IVF...and if your doctor has done NO other testing, then I would agree that is rushing it. It makes little sense not to test you further to see what issues might be causing you not to conceive. Just throwing Clomid at you is unhelpful and shouldn't have been done without reason. 

Did they track your cycles while on Clomid? As in, did you get ultrasounds and bloodwork during those cycles?

I am sorry to have to ask, but do you have a known cause for your daughter's death? Depending on that, it could bring up more questions or remove some.

Also, not having a period for 6 months after giving birth is not uncommon, so forcing it could have caused some issues, too. It's reallllly hard to say.

I am not sure what blood tests your doctor did to figure out why you got Pre-e, but here is a list of what I've had done during my repeat loss testing. It's decently comprehensive and might help you:

Blood tests: 

* Factor II
* Beta-2 Glycoprotein 1 IGG AB
* Beta-2 Glycoprotein 1 IGM AB
* TSH, T4, and T3)
* Antinuclear antibody (ANA)
* Factor V Mutation,
* prothrombin gene mutation
* Anticardiolipin AGG+IGM
* Lupus Anticoagulant Comp,
* Hgb A1c and Estim. Ave Glu (eAG)
* Antimullerian Hormone (AMH)
* Baseline LH (CD3 test)
* FSH (CD3 test)
* Estradiol (CD3 test)
* LH during surge time
* Estradiol during surge time
* Homocysteine
* DHEA Sulfate
* Insulin
* Prolactin
* Day 21 Progesterone testing (numerous cycles)
* Blood karyotyping
* Ferritin
* Folates
* Total Iron Binding Capacity with Iron
* Reticulocyte Count
* Vitamin B12
* Folic Acid
* Protein S
* Protein C

Others:

* Saline Ultrasound
* Hysteroscopy with endometrial biopsy
* 23andme (which I used for my MTHFR results)

<p>I&#39;ve heard about Zoloft quite a bit. It seems to be fairly commonly prescribed. I remember being on it when I was 16 or 17, but that whole timeline of trying to find a good combination of drugs runs together in my head. Definitely one to consider, though. </p>

<p>Yeah, about that woman...the hospital called to give me a survey on how my stay was. I was honest and told them about her. They apologized profusely and said they didn&#39;t know how she managed to get in to see patients. Too little, too late for me.</p>

<p>I still have to figure out how to quit my shitty job. I&#39;ve got a possible job opportunity to do stained glass that I need to send in my resume for... don&#39;t know why I couldn&#39;t get hired for this. Definitely qualified with my glass/art background. Cross your fingers for me!</p>

1) Very very sad about Sam
2) Neutral and nihilistic about everything
3) Intensely focused on a new pregnancy

Most often I think I fall into category 3, and then the remainder of my time is divided between categories 1 and 2. I can hop among any of these within a day or even an hour, but more likely I'll spend an entire day or two in one of them. Today I think I feel like somewhere around a 2.5-- I both very much want to get pregnant and also don't care about anything at all.

I can't tell if this is hormonal, grief-driven, or if I'm just trying to guard my heart against the pain of getting my period again at the end of this cycle by tempering my ""I need to be pregnant right this minute"" thoughts with the more desolate ""it's fine if I never have another baby again because what is life anyways?"" thoughts. 

To add to that, I keep thinking ""THIS is my month,"" merely because my research (and my therapist) have said that most commonly, full fertility will return to women around the third cycle postpartum, so I'm hopeful that this is the one where my luteal phase would at least be adequate. But then my midwife and endocrinologist and also the whole internet have also warned me it could take up to 6 months for full fertility to return, so then I temper my hope with reminding myself of that. 

It's such a mental yo-yo, to continue vacillating back and forth and trying to find a line to walk each month where I am hopeful enough to actually bother to keep trying, and not so sure that it will happen that I fall into a new depression with the start of each period. 

Also I have a really bad headache and feel kind of nauseous today. If I were in the TWW I'd be symptom spotting these so hardcore, but it's CD9 for me and I think they're just a byproduct of having been very underslept for the past few days.

Spent this week trying to get my doctors to refer me for an early scan, not as easy as it should have been considering my history. Long story short I will be referred to have one next Thursday, this week has dragged and I know next week will until I have the scan. Part of me wants to be excited but then part is realistic and want to wait to confirm it's not ectopic before getting excited. 
Doctor requested a TSH blood test as my last test was over 6, nurse had four attempts, my veins weren't playing games, she got a tiny amount out on the last go, both of us hoping that it will be enough. 
I've been worrying more today, shit day at work and I did another clearblue test it still said 1-2 weeks, which was what I got last week. Have constant pain/cramps which aren't very different to what I had with ectopic, so wasn't really concerned but mentioned it to my go and she made a link to the endo they found when removing my ectopic.
It's really nice to have a place to share my feelings, helps just being able to talk.

I had 3 early losses (~5 weeks) before this pregnancy (during ~1.5 years of trying), and I have been absolutely terrified from Day 1. Still am. The best advice I got from this sub was to take it one step at a time, and don't beat yourself up for not being ""excited enough"" or for being scared.

Something that's helped me a lot is to think of little things I can do that allow my husband to get excited while not putting too much pressure on me to feel the same or to commit to anything. For example, we'll talk casually about nursery decoration ideas, but not buy anything. Or make plans to take a trip at the end of next summer, and talk about both possibilities - with a baby, and without a baby.

From what I've seen of others on this sub, the fear never really goes away (as nutella47 mentions in her comment as well). But even at 11 weeks, it's not all-consuming anymore. I still get anxious a few times a day, but I can think about other things. And maybe I'll eventually get to a point where I can feel excited about the pregnancy itself, but I've made peace with the possibility that I might never get there, and that's OK. Everyone's journey is different, and prior loss(es) definitely affect the experience.

I hope you have an uneventful 9 months, and that you are eventually able to find some peace! This thread is a great place for cautious optimism - I've found so much support for both the exciting moments and the terrifying moments, so I hope we can do that for you as well. <3",[],,t1_dlssyiw,False,0,[],False,"<div class=""md""><p>I&#39;m not too far in yet (11+4), but I can relate to everything you&#39;ve said here. I had 3 early losses (~5 weeks) before this pregnancy (during ~1.5 years of trying), and I have been absolutely terrified from Day 1. Still am. The best advice I got from this sub was to take it one step at a time, and don&#39;t beat yourself up for not being &quot;excited enough&quot; or for being scared.</p>

<p>Something that&#39;s helped me a lot is to think of little things I can do that allow my husband to get excited while not putting too much pressure on me to feel the same or to commit to anything. For example, we&#39;ll talk casually about nursery decoration ideas, but not buy anything. Or make plans to take a trip at the end of next summer, and talk about both possibilities - with a baby, and without a baby.</p>

<p>From what I&#39;ve seen of others on this sub, the fear never really goes away (as nutella47 mentions in her comment as well). But even at 11 weeks, it&#39;s not all-consuming anymore. I still get anxious a few times a day, but I can think about other things. And maybe I&#39;ll eventually get to a point where I can feel excited about the pregnancy itself, but I&#39;ve made peace with the possibility that I might never get there, and that&#39;s OK. Everyone&#39;s journey is different, and prior loss(es) definitely affect the experience.</p>

I couldn't even respond straight away. I just looked at him and his baby. Then eventually managed to say ""oh I'm not sure. I don't have any kids."" I wanted the ground to swallow me up.

How can I be such a godawful failure and deprive my family and the world of my son?

I am terrified. 

Back in June I miscarried during my 5th week, naturally at home after 10 cycles of trying. We were crushed. I cannot believe we got pregnant again so quickly, we both just assumed it would take a while again, but apparently not! And I'm terrified. 

I knew it probably 4 days before we took a test but I wanted to try to live in a dream where I didn't know until it was safe... but came to my senses and knew if I miscarried again I wanted it recorded with my doctor. My husband was so excited when he saw the ""Pregnant 2-3"" on the display. I didn't even smile. I immediately realized how scared I was. I want this child SO badly. 

Everything feels different. I had very mild, almost non existent breast pain before. No sensitivities to smells. No inkling of sickness. My lines on pregnancy tests were always there but fainter than the control line.

This time? My bra feels like it's shaving off my nipples everyday and my breasts are so tender and swollen. Every time I even slightly touch my tongue with a toothbrush I gag.  I can smell everything, and my tummy turns quite frequently at things. And I'm pretty sure I pee at least twice an hour.  

But I can't calm down. I wake up every night and I'm almost in a full blown panic attack. This morning I woke up at 4am to go to the washroom and realized my boobs felt completely normal. I felt normal.  

I. Flipped. 

I got in my car and drove to the 24hr drug store and bought 3 pregnancy tests. I NEEDED to see a line. We had only done digital this time. The test line was so dark it stole ink from the control line, lol. Then about an hour of being awake, my breast tenderness came back. 

Is this how it's going to be? Am I constantly going to panic about everything? When feelings ebb and flow, will I go to a dark place? How do you come back from a miscarriage and go into a pregnancy happy again?

I look for blood every time I use the washroom, and sometimes just do random ""spot checks"".  I see so many strong people in this subreddit and in these alumni threads and all I can think is ""how did you do it? How did you make it so far?""

I shared my loss on my facebook because I feel it&#39;s NOT talked about enough and to my surprise, I had SO MANY friends tell me they suffered the same loss and provide their support.  It needs to NOT be so hidden from the world, it happens in 1 in 4 pregnancies, it needs to be shared.</p>

I asked the nurse if that was good or bad and she said it's at the lower end of normal, and to see what today's blood results were.

I'm nervous.  I know that seeing only a sac and no embryo at 6+3 is not unusual and that once you get to the point of having ultrasounds, ultrasounds are way more reliable than hCG numbers, but I'm still nervous.

I visited my midwife this morning for a Zoloft RX. She was supportive and helpful and didn't push on any triggers, so I definitely didn't need to worry about this appointment as much as I was worrying about it. She called in a prescription for me, and told me to come see her again in three weeks so we can evaluate the effects and the dosage. We talked about my hormone imbalance and she told me that I should see a few day jump in my luteal phase in the next cycle or two-- it shouldn't just increase one day at a time for months and months and months, but that it takes a lot of women at least six months to return to full fertility after a full term delivery. So. That's like the last thing I want to hear, of course. She suggested I speak with an an RE after a few more cycles if it hasn't corrected, because they can't do much to test/correct hormone issues at their office, that's really an endo's job.

I happened to have my bi-monthly standing appointment with my endocrinologist (not a reproductive specialist but obviously can address hormone imbalances) to check my thyroid levels immediately afterwards. I really like my endocrinologist but her nurse is some special kind of moron. Both my endo and midwife work within the same hospital system so they both have access to the same chart, so I guess that the ""postpartum anxiety"" diagnosis from a half hour earlier was right there on top of the chart. The nurse saw that, assumed I was pregnant, and passed that onto my endo. She came in all, ""so when are you due?"" and I was like ""wtf are you talking about?"" And then she looked at my chart, remembered that I had a stillbirth three months ago, apologized, and then ascertained that I'm TTC and what we needed to do to check my levels today. I told her about my luteal phase insufficiency, and she repeated the midwife's line of, ""it can take as long as six months."" But she did determine that there were a few other things she could look at to ensure that there isn't anything else at play that could be interfering with my hormones, like any weird blood sugar issues. I don't anticipate any of that, but it was nice of her to take it that seriously. She's also going to, pending my TSH levels, call in an RX for Synthroid for me instead of the generic, because she and my acupuncturist both agree that that would be a better option to ensure hormone stability as I'm recovering. And I have an appointment with her in a couple more months where I'll really push the need for more testing of reproductive hormones if I feel the need, because why delay any of this? 

But at the end of it all, I'm just sad and tired and incensed at the injustice of it all. And I'm completely baffled about how everyone is just so willing to accept that time is what I need to heal and get pregnant again. I'm so tired of hearing, ""You need to give it time, you JUST had a baby."" I didn't just have a baby, I had a dead baby, and if I had just had a baby I wouldn't be in the situation I'm currently in. I'd be too excited about my baby to be thinking about another baby. Time is the last thing I want to give to this situation.

Everything had been ready for a while but it took time, even after he was born, for me to be ready to tell my story and help others. It was surreal and I have immense gratitude. After all those losses I learned many lessons, but a big one is that I rarely get stressed out by my baby because I'm so grateful he's here. 

After the 4th loss I was drained and decided to wait a few months. (I'm a healthcare provider and overall very healthy person so I was even more upset and baffled) I had recently switched my supplements and stopped eating eggs and we conceived my son 2 weeks after that 4th miscarriage (no period between). I started bleeding at 7 weeks and almost lost my shit. But he was just fine. I couldn't believe it. 

The anxiety at the beginning of pregnancy is no joke, especially when you've miscarried before. That's where mindfulness was invaluable for me. Actually, I needed it the whole pregnancy!

I'm convinced some of the changes I made were the difference maker in my 5th pregnancy. My WBC count went way up (it had been on the low end of normal). There's an eGuide on the website with more info, if that's interesting to anyone. It's geared toward those with no obvious explanation for miscarriage, but is good info for everyone. 

Anyway! YES there is hope, and he's sleeping right next to meüíô

Sorry for the wall of rambling text - was just super sad/frustrating & needed to vent. Hopefully all of our conversations aren't like this for her entire pregnancy.
