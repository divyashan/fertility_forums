The whole process was a bit much for me. I'm deeply afraid of needles and panicked when they tried placing the IV and ripped it out accidentally when I jerked my hand away from the nurse. The anesthesiologist decided to wait until I was in the OR to place it again. If you are needle phobic, ask if they can provide some sort of anxiety medication or laughing gas prior to poking you. They gave me laughing gas in the OR to ease my nerves and were able to get the IV placed. Going under was a bit scary for me as everything seemed to fade slowly and I honestly felt like I was dying. This is apparently normal according to the people I've talked with who have been put under for other procedures. The anesthesia will smell bad right before you're out. That was the last thing I heard from the anesthesiologist. He said ""it's gonna get stinky. It's gonna smell bad"" and then I was out. Woke up in the recovery room. My husband said the procedure itself was fast. He left to get coffee when they took me back to the OR and when he returned, they said it was done. It took about an hour to wake up from the anesthesia though. They packed my vagina with gauze that had to be removed before I could be discharged. It was uncomfortable when the nurse removed it, but not terrible. I felt like she was a magician doing the scarf up the sleeve trick. You will occasionally smell the anesthesia when you get home. It is weird. Like you will be just chilling and then randomly smell that stinky smell again. This is normal according to the anesthesiologist. Bleeding was pretty minor compared to what I thought it would be. I used just regular pads. The bleeding subsided to barely noticable by Monday where it was only visible when I wiped after peeing. The pain afterwards was manageable with the ibuprofen and oxycodone they gave me. I made the mistake on Saturday of going longer than I should have between doses and it felt like a thousand knives were stabbing my crotch. Definitely keep up on the meds. By Sunday, I was taking mostly just ibuprofen. I have had a few moments where the ibuprofen hasn't been enough and I have taken the oxys for it, but that was maybe 3 occasions since Sunday. I'm now just taking 1 ibuprofen (it is the hospital strength big tablet) every 8-10 hours or so. I could probably stop, but haven't yet. The doctor that did the procedure told me 8 weeks no sex or anything in the vagina and to wait 6 months before conceiving again. My midwife hasn't specified her no sex suggestion, but said to have 3 periods before conceiving again. I meet with her next Friday for a post-op exam to make sure everything is healing as it should and I'm sure she will tell me what she suggests for waiting on sex.

While having vocal cord palsy & asthma does increase your risk, you have to keep that risk in context. The chances of having a complication under anaesthesia are incredibly rare - and even more so for a straightforward elective procedure.  Driving a car is more dangerous.

Most d&c‚Äôs are performed using a laryngeal mask - which is the preferred airway device in asthmatics and patients with vocal cord injuries (outside of other circumstances that would make intubation preferable, like if you weren‚Äôt fasted).

The procedure itself is quick - sometimes <10 minutes.

I‚Äôve given anaesthetics for thousands of d&c‚Äôs, and now I‚Äôve had two d&c‚Äôs myself. I think the best advice is that it‚Äôs very safe, and to be kind to yourself.

I‚Äôm so so very sorry for your loss. There‚Äôs no way to sugar coat how hard this will be emotionally and I‚Äôm here to talk if you need.

I had a d&c last October after a 14 week loss. I wasn‚Äôt too scared because I‚Äôd had a laparoscopic surgery in July - but was mostly just upset about the loss, I can‚Äôt say it was painful afterwards, had lots of pain killers etc after , however beforehand I was told to insert misoprostol to help dilate my cervix. This caused intense pain, contractions pretty much. (Have a friend who has had a live birth and a miscarriage with misoprostol and said the pain was very similar) so for me this was the worst part. This also eventually caused a lot of very heavy bleeding too, and because my surgery got delayed, I started to really worry I‚Äôd miscarry in the bathroom of my hospital room and I got pretty upset by this. I had very large blood clots (bigger than my fist) 

Tbh I don‚Äôt really remember how I felt afterwards physically because I was so overwhelmed emotionally - it‚Äôs how I felt emotionally that I remember and that has stuck with me, do you have a good doctor? Do you feel comfortable asking for pain meds etc? 

I think under anaesthetic is best - what I saw in the toilet of the room while I was waiting after the misoprostol was horrifying enough, I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôd want to be awake for the procedure. 

Hope this helps and feel free to message me on Instagram if you have more questions or want to talk (I don‚Äôt use reddit as much)

My doctor said we shouldn&#39;t try again until after my first true period, so when I went back to tracking my ovulation again and we hit all the right days, I was like &quot;well we&#39;ve got this.&quot; It&#39;s so hard knowing that it may take months. And I think even harder than that is the fear I have underlying everything, which says to me &quot;how the heck do you even know your body can carry a baby to term, when the evidence points100% the other way?&quot; So much of me just wants to fast forward, to a point in time when I have a healthy happy baby in my arms. </p>

I took a test before the 4 week mark and there was a faint line on the test and my first reaction was to burst into tears and hyperventilate. The second was after having a follow up with the doctor on Tuesday. I don&#39;t think I&#39;m moving forward very well, I&#39;ve been compartmentalizing the grief which leads to me being upset randomly so I want to get a hold on my grief and find a healthy way to move forward.</p>

We‚Äôre not really TRYING per say right now so I‚Äôm not using opks or temping but we are not preventing. Just kinda letting natural do its thing, while still tracking my cycle. But tracking has been a mess with all of these crazy all over the place symptoms.</p>

&#x200B;

I had my miscarriage in March at 12 weeks. We were over the moon excited when we found out we were pregnant. We made the novice mistake of telling EVERYONE who would listen that we were pregnant. My boss announced she was pregnant the same time I did. I was excited to have her on this journey with me. The first scan went well, baby had a heartbeat. Next scan we found out the heartbeat had stopped and I had a missed miscarriage. Heartbreaking. Absolutely heartbreaking. 

&#x200B;

I took about 6 weeks off from work in short term disability. I really needed that time as I was a wreck. I was diagnosed with postpartum depression. I started counseling, and reading self-help books. I eventually came back to work and..it was a little weird because everyone knew but everyone was nice and no one really mentioned it. (aside from one or two people sharing their condolences). The condolences are hard...because you sometimes want to pretend nothing happened but you can't and they mean well. 

&#x200B;

My boss's pregnancy has been going great. I am happy for her. It is hard to hear her talk about it and see her showing though. No one really understands how I am feeling. My husband will see her and make small talk about the nursery and how she is feeling. It truly breaks my heart everytime I hear them talking about her pregnancy. But I stay quiet and stoic. I don't show anyone anything. I will dismiss myself from uncomfortable conversations if I can but..sometimes I can't. 

&#x200B;

I think about my miscarriage [every.single.day](https://every.single.day). Everyday it comes to mind. Everyday I think about what could have been and why me. My cycles have been all messed up since the miscarriage and that makes it difficult too. We want to try again and I no longer understand my body. I'm also terrified this will happen again. My sister has reoccurring miscarriages so its hard not to think its familial. I got the ava bracelet to try to understand what is happening and started drinking fertility teas. IDK. I try to control what I can which helps but...it hurts. and it may always hurt. 

&#x200B;

I posted here last week for the first time after my CP. I went to my OBGYN on Friday to confirm that I was miscarrying (at 5 weeks) and basically to make sure that everything else is fine.

Yesterday, the nurse calls with the results of my blood test. Unsurprising, the test came back negative. She said there was like 1.4 HCG in my blood, but anything less than 5 is considered ""not pregnant."" Great news!! Then she reiterated that I need to wait 2 months before trying again. This time I asked why. She told me it's so that my hormones can have time to get back to normal. She also threw in the caveat that things happen and pregnancy may come sooner. But she said this after telling me that my hormone levels were back to normal... so I'm just confused.

Others have already pointed out that PlanB can't cause a miscarriage, and that it's totally normal to blame yourself in this situation.

Many, many women have early miscarriages and don't even know it because it happens so close to their period. Many, many women have BC failure (I got pregnant even when I was taking BC on a timer daily) or condom failure.

You are totally not alone--every time you walk into a mall or grocery store, there are women around you who have dealt with accidental pregnancy and/or loss and guilt. What you are going through is something that so many have gone through.

This is the shittiest club to be in but its also one of the most supportive and filled with the kindest people. 

I completely empathize with you on feeling like pregnancy was another lifetime ago and also on how you feel about the procedure. I've found that my brain has shut down a good portion of the memories I have of being in the hospital for a week simply because I cannot handle them yet. 

Let yourself feel your feelings, as silly as that sounds. Trying to wall off the anger and sadness will only make the process worse. Everything you're feeling is normal. You are allowed to be angry and sad. Life is really really unfair, and you just got dealt one of the shittiest hands. If you can, try and find one friend that will listen and not pass any judgement and just let you talk. I'm sure your husband is doing a wonderful job taking care of you and is listening to how you feel but I feel like a friend aside from your relationship can also be so helpful.

<p>This is the shittiest club to be in but its also one of the most supportive and filled with the kindest people. </p>

<p>I completely empathize with you on feeling like pregnancy was another lifetime ago and also on how you feel about the procedure. I&#39;ve found that my brain has shut down a good portion of the memories I have of being in the hospital for a week simply because I cannot handle them yet. </p>

<p>Let yourself feel your feelings, as silly as that sounds. Trying to wall off the anger and sadness will only make the process worse. Everything you&#39;re feeling is normal. You are allowed to be angry and sad. Life is really really unfair, and you just got dealt one of the shittiest hands. If you can, try and find one friend that will listen and not pass any judgement and just let you talk. I&#39;m sure your husband is doing a wonderful job taking care of you and is listening to how you feel but I feel like a friend aside from your relationship can also be so helpful. </p>

It's the worst thing that could happen to a person.

I know you're upset about things you did during the 6 weeks, but please remember for at least the first 3 weeks there wouldn't have been any hcg in your system to give you any signs (since weeks 1-2 are pre-ovulation, and week 3 is pre-implantation), so you didn't miss or ignore the signs, they would have only been apparent for a few weeks, and many women don't notice anything until much later even. 

My loss was at 9 weeks, and I also didn't have any symptoms of being pregnant, I only knew because we'd been trying forever, and it was an ivf cycle. The things you did or didn't do during the time you were pregnant are very, very unlikely to have caused this, and if you can, please release the guilt you're expressing, it doesn't belong to you. This happened to you, it's not something you caused.

As far as advice, in my case I'm desperate to be pregnant again. It sounds like your boyfriend was initially supportive, and my partner was too, though your boyfriend's support feels like it tapered off, and I'm really familiar with that. For some men since it's not happening to them it feels like it wasn't real. My husband doesn't want to know the gender (we tested the baby) because, inches words, that would make it more real, and he just wants to move on. It's possible your boyfriend thinks by moving on quickly that it'll help you out. Do you feel like you want to talk about getting pregnant again? Or specific support you need from him? Nothing anyone said or did could help me, which I know isn't great advice, but I trusted my husband wasn't being more supportive just because that's how he had to handle it.

Counseling is a great idea, and I was impatient for it to ‚Äúfix‚Äù me right away, but honestly it took medication and a year of therapy and the successful birth of my second set of twins to really make me feel close to normal.  And triggers are unfortunately unpredictable and debilitating at times.  My therapist used to say, your protective veneer is so thin and cracked after loss, it‚Äôs ok to do whatever you have to do keep it safe and let things heal.  Don‚Äôt feel guilty about missing other baby showers or avoiding kids sections in stories or what have you - you do you while you are trying to survive.  

As referenced above, I do have two healthy living twins now.  And I didn‚Äôt have cerclage but I did have closer monitoring with the second pregnancy.  And I totally understand your fear, I was a complete mess throughout the second pregnancy - I would hit milestones (like 22 weeks) and just be terrified to lose more babies again.  That‚Äôs why I think counseling can be so helpful - no one really understands this fear until you‚Äôve experienced this loss before.  

I post this a lot on this sub, but honestly it‚Äôs still the best passage to summarize grief and loss.  I hope reading it helps you as it helps me even today.   Be kind to each other, it‚Äôs ok to feel how you feel and don‚Äôt let anyone rush you from recovering from losing Blake.  

Grief

as for grief, you'll find it comes in waves. When the ship is first wrecked, you're drowning, with wreckage all around you. Everything floating around you reminds you of the beauty and the magnificence of the ship that was, and is no more. And all you can do is float. You find some piece of the wreckage and you hang on for a while. Maybe it's some physical thing. Maybe it's a happy memory or a photograph. Maybe it's a person who is also floating. For a while, all you can do is float. Stay alive.

In the beginning, the waves are 100 feet tall and crash over you without mercy. They come 10 seconds apart and don't even give you time to catch your breath. All you can do is hang on and float. After a while, maybe weeks, maybe months, you'll find the waves are still 100 feet tall, but they come further apart. When they come, they still crash all over you and wipe you out. But in between, you can breathe, you can function. You never know what's going to trigger the grief. It might be a song, a picture, a street intersection, the smell of a cup of coffee. It can be just about anything...and the wave comes crashing. But in between waves, there is life.

Somewhere down the line, and it's different for everybody, you find that the waves are only 80 feet tall. Or 50 feet tall. And while they still come, they come further apart. You can see them coming. An anniversary, a birthday, or Christmas, or landing at O'Hare. You can see it coming, for the most part, and prepare yourself. And when it washes over you, you know that somehow you will, again, come out the other side. Soaking wet, sputtering, still hanging on to some tiny piece of the wreckage, but you'll come out. Take it from an old guy. The waves never stop coming, and somehow you don't really want them to. But you learn that you'll survive them. And other waves will come. And you'll survive them too. If you're lucky, you'll have lots of scars from lots of loves. And lots of shipwrecks.",[],,t1_eqjk1lb,False,0,[],False,"<div class=""md""><p>I am so sorry for your loss.

<p>If you want to share your story more in depth feel free to shoot me a message. I&#39;ve found telling people what I went through has been helpful to me. I didn&#39;t go into labor (had to be induced) and can&#39;t personally comment on the cerclage, but I&#39;ve met a high risk OB before who said she does them routinely and has success with them.</p>

<p>I&#39;m so sorry for what you&#39;ve gone through.</p>

Hi all. Joining you as I lay in my hospital bed, after my laparoscopic and d&c yesterday. Hoping I can go home today after three days of being here, unprepared for this. It was my first pregnancy  and I was 6 weeks along. 

I'm posting in the hopes to see if anyone here has had a similar issue with their pregnancy. You can read my post history if you would like to read my experience as it happened the first two days but basically, on Wednesday, I started spotting and then had a quick gush of blood so off to the ER I went.

My u/s were like nothing the doctors here at this hospital have seen before. There was a mass at the prosterior wall of my uterus but they don't believe it was the baby. They had to post a bulletin for all the ob's in my province to review my file because they were stumped. One specialist thought maybe it was due to the miscarriage as it was happening. I have to come back in two weeks to have another check to ensure that mass is gone.

We have an app in our province that lets me see my bloodwork results which is how I found out my exact levels. On Wednesday, my hcg was at ~18700. Thursday, they dropped to ~18400 but yesterday before my surgery, they were back up to ~21000, even though I was told the day before the miscarriage had happened. I had the laparoscopic first to ensure it wasn't ectopic - it wasn't and they found the embryo right where she was supposed to be in my uterus but I guess it just wasn't viable.

I'm not sure if there is any other relevant info I can provide but that's the basic long and short of it.

Has anyone gone through something similar before? I'm just trying to wrap my brain around what happened here.",[],,t1_eqe5b18,False,0,[],False,"<div class=""md""><p>Edit: I just realized this is yesterdays thread.

Well, this is my 3rd pregnancy in 7 months.  We started trying June 2016.  Oct 2018 I finally got pregnant but that ended in a ruptured tube at 8 weeks.  I started IUI treatment, and got pregnant again in March, but that turned out to be a miscarriage at 6 weeks.  Well, we got pregnant again at the end of May, and today was my 6wk US.  Well, we only saw a sac which I thought the tech said was in the uterus.  My doctor came in and said this pregnancy is absolutely done bc there was no fetal pole, and if my HCG was high then it was probably another ectopic pregnancy.  Labs came back, and it was 5700 and progesterone was 29.  Eight days ago HCG was 443 and progesterone was 32.  So it's looking like my other tube is in jeopardy.

I have a follow up US and blood test scheduled for Monday.  Apparently, he just wants to verify that no fetus shows up and then Ill get scheduled for a D and C.

Im not sure why Im posting.  I cried a little bit earlier, and now I mostly feel just numb.

I got my diagnosis of ectopic on 5/23 in the ER for severe abdominal pain at about 6.5 weeks.  I got my first MTX shot on 5/24 and my second, and last, on 5/27.  My HCG was very high (got up to 17,000), so my Dr was pretty aggressive with the medication.  It sounds like for you that they may have just split up one dose into 2 different needles.  

Now, MTX effects everyone differntly, so my experience may not be your experience, but I started to feel like total garbage about 36 hrs after the first shot and almost immediately worse following the 2nd shot.  My worst side effects have been all gastrointestinal.  I'm talking the worst gas pains I have ever felt in my life.  The kind that take up your whole abdomen.  This is super TMI, but I wish someone warned me.... I had rectal/anal cramping that had me making audible sounds.  They would last for like 20 mins at a time and then go away.  BMs were painful.  It was not a pleasant experience for me and I honestly was paranoid the whole time that something was severely wrong with me.

But, the beginning of this week, I seemed to have turned a corner.  I havent had any of that weird, painful butt cramping in like 3 days. Today I woke up and was surprised to feel relatively normal. 

So, for me, it was a week of hell.  But my HCG was a lot higher and I had two full dose shots really close to one another. I hope I didnt scare you! I wish I was prepared for how bad it could be because it was a super scary experience. If you have any more questions, let me know.

If you already had a normal, healthy pregnancy, the chances are very high that it is a random chromosomal error. 

If you do the testing and it confirms a chromosomal abnormality, that doesn‚Äôt really change anything for you moving forward. You might then want to do a karyotype in yourself and your husband to see if it was truly random, or whether it could have been caused by which would be another $600 or so, if your insurance doesn‚Äôt cover it. Or... you could just do that now, and end up $200 ahead. 

If you do the testing, and it comes back that your embryo was chromosomally normal, this also doesn‚Äôt tell you much. It just sends you down a path of more and more expensive tests to pinpoint the problem. Like the karyotype (which, again, you could just do now), or a carrier screening (unless you already had this done when you were pregnant with your first - my OB does this as part of a pregnancy work up) or a RPL blood work panel. The RPL panel looks for autoimmune issues, blood clotting disorders, etc. But again, you could just do that now, probably for less than $800. And if you had a previous healthy pregnancy, you probably don‚Äôt have those issues. I could be wrong, but I don‚Äôt think they manifest randomly - I think you have them, or you don‚Äôt. 

Finally, I‚Äôm not familiar with this type of testing, but if it‚Äôs similar to PGS testing, which I have done, there‚Äôs a chance it could tell you the embryo was chromosomally normal, when it actually wasn‚Äôt. PGS doesn‚Äôt test for every random genetic issue - it only looks at whether the embryo has the right number of chromosomes. 

So... for all those reasons, it wouldn‚Äôt be worth it for me. Coming from someone who has lost two babies. The first was a 9 week loss and I‚Äôm certain was a random chromosomal abnormality (the vast majority of miscarriages), and the second was an 11 week loss of a PGS-tested allegedly chromosomally normal embryo (But that I believe had a rather genetic issue that PGS just doesn‚Äôt screen for).

In either of those instances, if I had a definitive answer as to whether genetic testing would have considered them chromosomally normal or abnormal, nothing else would have changed in my journey (treatment, testing... it all would have been the same as it was without definitively knowing).

<p>I stayed at the next job for less than a year,  again,  I had no motivation or drive to progress in the company, but also the company wasn&#39;t tbe right fit and my boss treated me like his PA (I&#39;m not a PA)</p>

<p>I&#39;ve been in my current job for 6 months, I still struggle with motivation,  especially when I&#39;ve had bad news regarding my fertility, I&#39;m only staying there as they have a good maternity leave policy and I&#39;m just about to have ivf. I&#39;m not sure what I&#39;ll do if our round of NHS funded ivf isn&#39;t a success, as we can&#39;t afford any other rounds.

Thank you all for being so supportive in my some of my darkest hours. Good luck on your journeys.</p>

Not being able to get to your normal weight is difficult. Having those problems because recurrent miscarriages must be devastating as it may feel like your losses, your pain, have disfigured your real you. Can you look into going to therapy? 


For me, good diet and exercising are the only things in this fertility journey that are up to me. I can't control when/if I ovulate, I can't control conception, I can't control implantation, I can't control not having a fucking miscarriage, I can't control my hormones. The lack of control is something that drives me crazy.


I already ate healthy before, but since we decided we will TTC last March I joined Crossfit and have been going to the gym 3/5days a week. Physically speaking, I feel amazing: I sleep better, my back hurts less, I can carry groceries easily.   On the scale, I haven't lost any weight at all. Technically, I am 6-7lbs heavier... But I look thinner (muscle weights more than fat!). However, the main advantage of exercise has been mental and emotional health. I don't only have fun with new friends every day at the gym, I feel I am in control of SOMETHING. It's the only thing helping me to deal with the uncertainty of fertility.


So my advice would be not to join a regular gym. Starting exercising is hard so you need to join a gym with some sort of lessons to start going with regulars. Until you develop a habit and your body starts craving for the hormones released by exercise, you need to look forward meeting the people at your gym. If you start seeing the gym as ""socialising"" time, you will have an easier time developing a routine.

<p>I‚Äôm really sorry you‚Äôve gone through so much, you‚Äôre not alone and not even unusual at all, many of us feel just like you and it sucks that it takes a lot of the fun out of trying. I still feel so envious of people who got pregnant after just a few months, who probably still think ttc sex is really fun and amazing, when for us it‚Äôll never be that way. We tried for a year with no success before moving to ivf, got a positive our first try and then lost that baby. I, like you, thought I had finally gotten some good luck and had it all taken away. I still feel desperate to be back there. Sorry this was so long but I really do feel all of what you‚Äôre saying, and can relate to it so much.</p>

It sounds like your husband already had low testosterone due to the pituitary issue (adenoma? prolactinoma? hypopituitarism?), so just stopping the testosterone may not solve this?

My husband has low testosterone / hypogonadotropic hypogonadism due to hypothyroid (and possibly something else, they're not sure). For that, the solution is to treat the hypothyroid *and also* a short course of Clomid to (if you're lucky) restart natural testosterone production. Perhaps the treatment for the pituitary + exogenous testosterone issue is similar (bromocriptine/cabergoline?).

If Clomid won't work due to the nature of the pituitary issue, there are other drugs that replace FSH and/or LH directly--for example Pregnyl or Ovidrel.

My husband's hypothyroid had gone undiagnosed for years, and he needed 4 months of Clomid treatment for natural testosterone production to return.

It might help if your husband sees a specialist in male fertility, rather than a generalist urologist or endocrinologist. Easier said than done, I know, but generalists are used to just handing out testosterone scripts...

I think you got shitty doctors. I don‚Äôt think thats because they are doctors, but because they are misinformed and have bad bedside manner. 
I am not a medical professional, but it‚Äôs my understanding that folate/folic acid is really important in early pregnancy. It prevents neural tube defects, and it‚Äôs recommended to start taking it before you conceive.
If you don‚Äôt process folic acid (homozygous for certain MTHFR mutations) you need methylfolate, not folic acid. Methylfolate is found in some veggies. Folic acid is attes to processed foods like cereal. It won‚Äôt harm you, it just won‚Äôt count for much since you don‚Äôt process it. Some prenatals have methylfolate, but most have folic acid. Because many people don‚Äôt know if they have this mutation or not, many OBs recommend 1000mcg of folic acid just to be on the safe side. 


I‚Äôm also pretty sure there is evidence that short luteal phase can be a problem. I don‚Äôt know if it is associated with miscarriage, but I‚Äôm pretty sure that less than 10 days is associated with less chance of conception.

That is also shitty that the one doc told you to ‚Äúwait and see‚Äù regarding the threatened miscarriage.

I am sorry for your loss.

Midwives can be awesome. They do a lot of training and they can help you in different ways and often at least in my area work with OBs. A lot I‚Äôve met are RNs in addition to being midwives.

However, I have had better experiences with an OB then midwife which might not be what you want to hear. Her view was miscarriage was natural and with my stillborns it was still natural as it happened in nature. I had 5 miscarriages before 8 weeks after my late 2nd trimester stillborns. The midwife had an OB over her as there were both in the practice and he honestly just seemed to take orders from her. They also never did any D&Cs as they weren‚Äôt natural.

I went to another OB and she detected the problem right away that it was a physical deformity with scar tissue due to not getting proper care after my stillborn boys. She did a D&C and I was pregnant 3 months later and carried to full term.  I‚Äôm going to be sexist and state until her I always preferred male doctors but looking back, men don‚Äôt know what it‚Äôs like to be pregnant or have sex from a woman‚Äôs perspective. I will always have a woman OB GYN from now on.

You have to be your own medical advocate. It‚Äôs unfortunately a lot of trying to find the right doctor or midwife. It sucks.

Tea might give you some peace of mind and more of a feeling of control, which is good, and you might think ""hey, can't hurt, might help."" But this is not the case. Many are not FDA-approved, which can be dangerous if you are trying to get, or are already, pregnant, because you just don't necessarily know what's in it. This goes for other supplements like Melatonin, so be careful with ANY supplements you take that aren't FDA-approved. My fertility doctor told me this, as did a geneticist I met with.

If you MUST get something that isn't FDA-approved, and even if you take vitamins, get it from a big company. They are more likely to do more R&D than a small company. Again, my fertility specialist told me this.

&#x200B;

You may have done/be doing all these things already, but--

&#x200B;

\--Take a prenatal vitamin, prescribed through your doctor (again, not an all-natural one). If you are on certain meds, like Lamictal, the folic acid in your prenatal might not be enough, so check the amounts on the label (I am on Lamictal, and I actually need about 5x the amount of folic acid than is present in my prenatal, even though it's touted as having one of the highest levels of folic acid).

&#x200B;

\--Track your cycles (duh. I'm sure you are doing this). I've found apps to be really helpful (I particularly like Glow) and also Clearblue tests, but also take your basal temperature etc.

&#x200B;

\--Get your blood levels checked, even if you're on a prenatal. You could be low on some vitamins that are essential to pregnancy.

&#x200B;

\--If you are VERY anxious or depressed, consider seeing a psychologist and possibly a psychiatrist. The hormones that your body puts out when you are emotionally unstable can affect pregnancy.

&#x200B;

\--Depending on your age, you should see a fertility doctor if you have been trying for a certain amount of time. My friend started TTC at 29 and her OBGYN said to see a fertility specialist if it had taken more than a year. I started trying at 31 and my doctor said to see a fertility specialist if it was taking more than 6 months. If you have had recurrent losses (like 2 or 3+) you should also see a fertility doctor. Many fertility doctors ARE covered by insurance (my copay is $40).

I had a TFMR at 23 weeks. I was told by my doctor that waiting to TTC is unnecessary, so as soon as the two weeks of no sex we were prescribed was over with my husband and I got right back at it. But it took 10 weeks to get my first period. We had sex every day, my body was doing all kinds of crazy things and I was constantly thinking I was pregnant, or that my period would come any second. It was extremely difficult. Around 5 weeks out I got a BFP, and was elated, and then crushed when I found out that the pregnancy hormone the test detected was left over from the pregnancy we had ended. I understand why many doctors recommend waiting at least one cycle.

Definitely do talk to your doctor about it again, but I think that ultimately, you have to do what's right for you. Ask yourself if you would be able to handle the stress of TTC (it's stressful!) while recovering physically and emotionally from your loss. And ask yourself if you would blame yourself if you get pregnant right away and then lose that baby too. Use the answers to those questions as your guide.  Sorry again for your loss.  


\*\*Edited to say that something that helps me deal with the feelings of guilt over moving on with my life, or of the feeling that my baby is less important to me as time goes on, is a little shrine that I built of things that remind me of her. No one who I haven't told about it knows what those little mementos mean to me, and they're discreet and pretty, so I can keep it in my living room in plain sight. This way I think about her every day - but the most important thing, I think, is that when I think of her I think of the good times we shared. If I catch myself thinking about the trauma and horror of losing her, I take a deep breath, and remind myself that even though the loss hurts me, she is at peace. I am lucky to have had the time that I did with her. I will appreciate and love her always. Your child may not have known this world, but he knew you, and he felt your love in the comfort and safety of your womb.

I was told by my doctor that waiting to TTC is unnecessary, so as soon as the two weeks of no sex we were prescribed was over with my husband and I got right back at it. But it took 10 weeks to get my first period. We had sex every day, my body was doing all kinds of crazy things and I was constantly thinking I was pregnant, or that my period would come any second. It was extremely difficult. Around 5 weeks out I got a BFP, and was elated, and then crushed when I found out that the pregnancy hormone the test detected was left over from the pregnancy we had ended. I understand why many doctors recommend waiting at least one cycle.</p>

<p>Definitely do talk to your doctor about it again, but I think that ultimately, you have to do what&#39;s right for you. Ask yourself if you would be able to handle the stress of TTC (it&#39;s stressful!) while recovering physically and emotionally from your loss. And ask yourself if you would blame yourself if you get pregnant right away and then lose that baby too. Use the answers to those questions as your guide.  Sorry again for your loss.  </p>

<p>**Edited to say that something that helps me deal with the feelings of guilt over moving on with my life, or of the feeling that my baby is less important to me as time goes on, is a little shrine that I built of things that remind me of her. No one who I haven&#39;t told about it knows what those little mementos mean to me, and they&#39;re discreet and pretty, so I can keep it in my living room in plain sight. This way I think about her every day - but the most important thing, I think, is that when I think of her I think of the good times we shared. If I catch myself thinking about the trauma and horror of losing her, I take a deep breath, and remind myself that even though the loss hurts me, she is at peace. I am lucky to have had the time that I did with her. I will appreciate and love her always. Your child may not have known this world, but he knew you, and he felt your love in the comfort and safety of your womb. Hold on to what is precious, and try to let go of the rest.</p>

I am 36 (going to be 37 in 2 months) so I feel the same as you.  Every month I wait feels agonizing.</p>

My understanding is that it‚Äôs age related (I‚Äôm 37) and due to egg quality. It‚Äôs been suggested to me to take Ubiquinol which I have started taking now (you could google it and have a read).

Like someone has mentioned, PGS is one way of testing before implanting the embryo, but it‚Äôs expensive and we can‚Äôt afford it.
