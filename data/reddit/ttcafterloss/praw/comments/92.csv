I'm not gonna lie, injecting myself does sound intimidating but you have made it sound more straight forward, so thank you for that. I do have aspirin at home that I bought after my second loss but never started taking. I wonder if I had whether I wouldn't have had the third loss.

Good for you balancing out TTC with some dedication on your own health. This past year took such a toll on me; I gained nearly 2 stone even without changing my diet THAT much and continuing to exercise. It is so tough on our bodies to go through what we have been through.

I tried to have a proper heart to heart with my husband last night and his reasoning for waiting a little longer is that a baby conceived now would be due in January, haha, nothing to do with Covid.

Did they give you a painkiller along with it? If so, was it like percocet or morphine? (ive gotten both) and if that, **did they give you an antinausea along with the painkiller?**

Lord almighty though, at one point I was yelling at my SO ‘I should’ve got a D&C!!’ But that was a bit dramatic looking back. I got a prescription for Naproxen so that’s helped along with Tylenol , but if you don’t have that you could basically use Advil and Tylenol. I bled very heavily and passed a lot of big clots/tissues on Friday. To the point I could feel them coming when I’d stand up. I had a bit of nausea and felt cold (not a fever tho), which the doctor I spoke to today said could be normal. Saturday I was still bleeding and passing smaller clots, but neither the cramps nor bleeding were as bad the second day. Yesterday was a lot better. Today I’ve bled a bit again but had pretty much no cramps. 

I would recommend a magic bag or a hot water bottle.

<p>When you are ready to make a decision: </p>

<p>If you don’t decide to try again, that’s OK. You know what you need for your mental, emotional, and physical health. If another possible loss doesn’t fit into that, then it simply doesn’t fit. </p>

<p>If you do decide to try again, that’s OK, too! You are so far from a “pathetic 35yo”. To all of you poor souls who have experienced more than one loss, I applaud your amazing strength in continuing on, no matter where your path takes you. </p>

<p>Please know that you are strong, and you are cared for. My sincerest of condolences for you, and the best of my hopes to you, as well.</p>

I have an almost 3 year old daughter. In August I had an ectopic immediately followed by what we thought was a normal pregnancy only to find out at 24 weeks he had a birth defect and we terminated. This just happened in February. We were gutted. 

My husband would 100% stop with just our one. The two experiences wrecked him.

That said, I’m so anxious to start trying again, but we agreed to wait until end of summer. I go down these rabbit holes terrified of everything that could go wrong from conception until like...their first birthday. I try and remind myself that in life, you are never safe. I think I just was very lucky for a very long time that nothing truly devastating ever happened to me and I sort of had this mentality that I was immune to it somehow.

My husband and I do a lot of therapy together, it started at every week post our son being stillborn and it’s backed off to every 3-4 weeks.

I know it can be real crappy seeing pregnant women or people with kids when going through this. It feels like everyone is announcing their due dates and having baby showers and it's annoying and upsetting. I think Shelly is different because she's very genuine and frank about her experience and she still tries to lift up all the ladies who are hoping for their rainbow babies to come. If you are looking for some optimism that there are women out there with quite a few disasters under their belt who were able to build a family I recommend checking out some chicks like Shelly.

My little girl was only 18 weeks when my water broke. There was nothing to be done. We waited in hospital for a couple of days to see if the amniotic sac would somehow replenish, but it didn't happen (the chances were really small anyway). I never went to labor on my own, so I had to be induced. 

My daughter was perfect in every way (we had had NIPT done earlier), but 18 weeks is obviously too small to survive. The final diagnosis was that the bleeding I had in 1st trimester somehow made the amniotic sac so fragile that something eventually caused a small tear.

My most recent miscarriage was early and probably due chromosomal abnormality, like most early miscarriages are. I had no bleeding this time. I had way more pregnancy symptoms and I felt the pregnancy was more ""normal"" in every way.

<p>I miscarried my first in October as well.
Got 3 normal periods after that and then didnt ovulate with induced meds to get a very mild flow even after 52days.
I am delayed with my periods again by a week.
Nothing feels normal.
Everyone around me is getting pregnant and u cant believe in just 1 try and having their second baby as well.</p>

Maybe there is a small issue that tests can't detect.

Fertility clinics are closed anyway.  

So be a very keen ovulation tracker, have lots of sex, and hope for the best.

<p>But, I keep telling myself “a healthy baby is more important than an age gap” and it does make me feel better when I start to concern myself with the inevitable age difference. </p>

<p>Beat if luck to you on this journey ❤️</p>

**Insurance:** See what your insurance policy says about seeing an RE/infertility treatment. It may say that you need a referral from your OB and/or there may be a designated waiting period (usually, 12 months of active intercourse without a pregnancy if you're under 35, or 6 months if you're 35+).

If your insurance has a designated waiting period AND you don't live in one of those states (or a country with different policies), you'll have to wait or pay out-of-pocket. If your insurance doesn't have that waiting period, but you need a referral from your OB, consider getting a second opinion from another OB.

<p>The only ultrasounds I had were the 2 during my early pregnancy before the miscarriage. After looking at PCOS symptoms, I definitely see a few that sound familiar- gaining weight easily (although that could be explained by the hypothyroidism), jawline acne, thinning hair (again, could be explained by thyroid).

<p>And I do look at my friends and sister who got pregnant quickly and had easy pregnancies with so much jealousy because of the bliss and ignorance they had and still have about it, with pregnancies that were all sunshine and roses. No matter how much therapy and meditation I do, I’ll be paranoid every day until I’m holding a healthy baby in my arms. </p>

<p>It also makes me wonder if I’ll be a different kind of parent; more cautious, doting and borderline obsessed than I would have been had i not had so much trouble conceiving and getting one earthside.</p>

First, I would call and ask to see an RE due to repeat loss. Explain your history, they make take you on as a patient after two losses. Some will require three losses before doing testing. That goes for OB's as well. An RE might be more helpful. Some OB's are extremely flippant about treating losses. Sometimes you get lucky and have one with experience. 

You can do the Repeat Loss Panel (RPL, you can search this sub for more detailed info). At a high level it is about 20 vials of blood that test for various vitamin levels, thyroid function, and clotting disorders. I had the RPL done after my second early loss and was found to have hypothyroidism and two blood clotting factors - both dangerous when untreated. And I had no outward symptoms of either.

I have decent insurance in the US and all of that testing cost about $2,200. Not sure how your experience would compare but at a minimum I would recommend thyroid testing.  I had this testing done through my PCP who happened to be trained in fertility, so I lucked out. Currently waiting for my first RE appointment where they'll do a little more testing and physical exam of uterus/tubes etc.

Even if you have this testing and find some potential factors, there's no way of knowing if those things specifically caused your losses. I'm kind of in that limbo now where I'm being treated but still apprehensive if it will help the next time I fall pregnant. 

The baby aspirin is low risk so you could really start that any time. It is prescribed for those who test positive for a clotting factor, but sometimes will also be prescribed in a ""might help, won't hurt"" kind of fashion. Progesterone supplements I'm kind of struggling with - I was on them for my last pregnancy and they really just drew out the inevitable. Lots of doctors say they can't save a pregnancy that's due to end in loss. But again, might help/won't hurt. 

Maybe do some research on enhancing egg quality, there are a few supplements you could take to potentially reduce the chance of a chromosomal abnormality.

I used FRER and Wondfo’s (I really like them, you can get a pack on Amazon with ovulation tests for relatively cheap) and had very clear, very easy to read bfps with those. I highly recommend them and they’re also pink dye.

I stopped birth control last august and my first 2 cycles I had maybe 1-2 small amounts of spotting during my luteal phase, now they are every single day, and I'm not sure whether it was the methotrexate I received when I had my ectopic or what but it certainly doesn't feel normal to me.

So last cycle I went to my gp to explain about the bleeding/cramps during my luteal phase so she had me do a progesterone test 7dpo which came back low, the gynae which she referred to for advice took this to mean I didn't ovulate that cycle, but I don't believe that because I had an lh surge, and this cycle the same thing has happen, plus I started tracking bbt and it has risen well. So I'm SURE I ovulate and the issue is low progesterone.

The general rule I understand is usually for women testing progesterone on cd21 or 7dpo depending on when you end up ovulating. I would definitely recommend getting bloods done because it cant hurt to have more information about what your hormones are up to. I'm currently 4dpo and going back for more bloods next week.

Yes definitely! Would love to keep in touch, it's so reassuring to know we aren't alone in this concern and hopefully find some solutions to fix it.

Also I have zero clue if this has any scientific evidence to it but this cycle after ovulation I've started eating 3 Brazil nuts per day, I've heard of others doing it and apparently it makes a difference to the luteal phase.

Your feelings are totally valid and not unreasonable. Taking a break isn't a crazy thing to do, this process can be all consuming and sometimes you just need to walk away and regroup. The other thing you've got to do- stop awfulizing.

I say this to you not as a unicorn. Not even close. We got pregnant after 23 months and 4 IUIs. I know the feeling you describe because its a part of who I am now- what if that was my only shot? what if it never happens again? why is this happening to me? What did I do to cause this? Its a runaway train of negative emotions that then dig up other negative emotions. Its all consuming, life altering, it fills you with this ugly feeling of grief, anger, and envy, its not fun. That process has a name- awfulizing.

The best way to beat it is to start rooting every thought in facts, and then train your brain to push away or reframe the thoughts that don't have facts. Here are some of mine:

That was my only chance- not fact. Lots of women miscarry and go on to have healthy pregnancies. Even women with infertility.

I did something to cause this- not fact. It was probably a genetic abnormality, 10-20% of pregnancies end this way.

There's something wrong with me- fact. My AMH is low, I have PCOS, and my body doesn't like to mature follicles.

...That means I'll never get pregnant- not fact. I already got pregnant once.

When it start to look like a train of thought-

I miscarried- fact. I'm not pregnant- fact. I'll never get pregnant- not fact. There's no way of knowing what will happen, it happened once, so that has to be a good sign. Stop.

Don't let yourself go past the not fact thought, because every other thought it breeds also isn't fact. The shitty reality is that you can't change what is, you can only change how you react to it and how you allow it to make you feel.

I had failed medical management at the end of January and a D&C in early February and have been trying again since. I'm currently 11 DPO and getting stark negatives so I think I'm out this month.

It is relentless. I swing between blind optimism and depression. I really wanted to be pregnant this cycle so I could have a baby in 2020, having lost babies that would have been due in January, March and August this year. I also wanted to get out of the first trimester by the beginning of July when my brother in law will be getting married. The hopes I was placing on this cycle seem completely insane given I have never made it out of the first trimester before, and that if I did get pregnant this cycle it would probably just mean I'd have chalked up four losses by early July, and the wedding will probably have to be postponed due to Coronavirus anyway.

My other brother in law got married last June. We conceived the second time just before his wedding. He and his wife must have conceived within days of us, first time trying, because they've just had their healthy baby boy on what would have been my due date second time round. We haven't met him yet due to the lockdown but I was hoping to have a little seed of my own growing by the time we have to see them.

But everyone that we are close to has got pregnant first or second cycle and had a healthy baby. I expect some of those will be going for round two soon and will have their second before we manage to have our first. And my Facebook feed is full of people announcing pregnancies where, like a masochist, I scroll back through their timelines to check when they got married and yep, nine or ten months before the due date. Of course. It just makes me feel so alone, like we are the only ones who have to go through this. 

I think the cycles of hope and dread won't end until we have our healthy babies in our arms.

I even find myself getting annoyed with people who talk about how sad they are about their multiple miscarriages because they're desperate to give their son or daughter a sibling and the age gap is getting bigger and bigger and they're worried it might not happen at all, and I want to scream ""I don't even have one child and I'm scared it won't happen!""

The good news is that yes, there are many women who have conceived and gone on to have healthy pregnancies quickly after a loss. Depending on your loss (if you had a D&C, for example), you may be on pelvic rest for a full two weeks; this is meant to let your body heal and avoid introducing any infections. So that means NOTHING up in there. No tampons, penises, dildos, vibrators, whatever else you might want to insert in your vagina. That said, the wait for your first cycle is for estimated due date purposes when you conceive. Because your loss was at 22w4d, you may have had to deliver, which may have other health implications. That said, I'm not your doctor, just an internet stranger, so... **Talk to your OB about any physical safety concerns.** 

There are some unsubstantiated claims (old wives' tales) about being more fertile in the first three months after a loss. Best advice I've received is to track your ovulation after your loss. It's easiest to do after your first period since you'll have an idea, but can be done at any time, using LH surge test strips. It's nice because it makes you feel like you have some control and helps that planner instinct.

One last piece of encouragement, by many, many doctors, 36 is no longer considered old for conceiving your first.

I am wondering if mine is low and that’s what is causing all of the losses, but with all of the craziness going on in the world right now I don’t want to be at a hospital if I don’t need to be. I have my fingers crossed for you. For the both of us; that our rainbow babies will come soon and stick with us this time. ❤️❤️</p>
