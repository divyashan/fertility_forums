Just for more context about the angel teaching, but it‚Äôs kinda long so feel more than welcome to skip it!

Its a teaching that has been passed down in my tribe for thousands of years. It‚Äôs not as hollow as people passively saying Heaven needed an angel. We have an entire detailed world of spirituality and how the womb operates in that way. We don‚Äôt have a human centric world view. We have a different concept of what life is, where it comes from, and how it‚Äôs to be honoured. In my people‚Äôs spirituality we value releasing control and submitting to the kichi-manito and the great mystery force of life. For us, something like blessing a baby to keep it from being called back even isn‚Äôt something we are allowed to do because unborn come from the spirit world and we can‚Äôt control them. 


I feel English doesn‚Äôt represent the concepts of my people the best and I‚Äôm sorry for that. When we say angels, it can conjure up the idea of people with wings who interfere with the living. It‚Äôs not that. It‚Äôs more metaphorical or based in energy and action. 

For us, the spiritual part of the world and the human part are different. The spiritual forces are indifferent to us mostly. Except maybe our ancestors. 

As an elder told me when during one of my losses, science helps us understand the biology of how these things can happen. And that‚Äôs really good. Spirituality can help us understand philosophy of how to heal from it. He told me that, like the doctor said, the body recognizes that something isn‚Äôt viable and that things need to start over. The cells talk to each other and do their thing. But all the love, anticipation, all the things related to having that baby are still within me with nowhere to go. That‚Äôs when I have to decide where that energy goes. How will my baby‚Äôs time in the world affect my time in the world? 

The way our people see it, that ‚Äúangel spirit‚Äù might already be going to help with a miracle across the globe or the galaxy for all we know. It might not even be to help a person. It could be an animal or a river. That‚Äôs the spiritual/non-human centered side. Once something is part of the spiritual world it‚Äôs beyond our understanding. The human side of it, is that as a nikawi (mama) your biology and heart is changed. And we are left with the responsibility of deciding what that means. Death isn‚Äôt the end in our belief system. The relationship with someone doesn‚Äôt end it just changes. For my last loss, I decided to name my son Kimiwan after the rain and whenever I have a panic attack I picture him the way he was in my dreams when I was pregnant. So when it rains or when I need him, he still brings me peace even if my yearning for him never goes away. I can‚Äôt control that he‚Äôs not here.  I can‚Äôt control that there are going to be times of weeping or anger. I can control (mostly) how I relate to him and remember him.",[],,t1_g7shqna,False,0,[],False,"<div class=""md""><p>I just wanted to offer that I mentioned this because a crisis of faith was part of this post.

I gave birth to our son, our first baby, exactly at 40 weeks about a month ago. The pregnancy was uncomplicated and actually really lovely; not at all what I was expecting. We felt really blessed, and it was easy since everything seemed perfect. All tests and scans looked great. We prayed for him, talked to, sang to, and read stories to him.

Then we lost him because he couldn't breathe on his own despite everything the doctors tried to do. I regained lucidity on the operating table (it was an emergency c section after a few complications arose during delivery with epidural), and my husband told me the baby didn't make it.

I had relied on my faith even as the delivery progressed from okay to bad to worse. Granted, at the time I assumed we'd bring him home no matter what, but reminding myself that none of this is a surprise to our timeless God helped to calm my fears. After finding out the baby was gone, I felt numb. I didn't know what to make of it. It took a while before it fully hit too since I had a long recovery (was in the hospital for 7 days after delivery).

Once I got home, it felt so strange to not have a baby around even though it was exactly as we left it. I felt so separated from God. We know a little more about what happened but it comes out to an anti-miracle, a one in a million chance, a true act of God.

We are Christians and we believe that for some reason, God's plan called for calling our baby home much, much sooner than expected.

<p>I never thought about needing an abo rtion because I was trying to get pregnant. But suddenly it wasn&#39;t about me, it was about what was right for my baby. And it was right to let him go. </p>

<p>What was interesting to me was that all the &quot;pro-life&quot; people in my family supported me and felt I did the right thing. I&#39;m glad about that but I wish they would vote with that same compassion.</p>

You could repost at /r/tfmr_support and get answers there. But I've actually been through a lot of what you're asking about so I'll respond here too.

When you say SFO do you mean San Francisco? I had my TFMR done there. I can definitely provide more specific info regarding doctors and locations if you want to PM me. We had an injection to stop the baby's heart, and then I was induced. Technically speaking, based on the medical literature, a D&E is safer than induction. But I was already 27 weeks and there are VERY few providers who will do a D&E that late, and my insurance wouldn't pay for it. So I chose to do the injection/induction instead. If I had chosen the D&E the only provider I could find who would do it was in Los Angeles and it was like $10,000. IDK if that has changed, it's been 6 years.

Our son's diagnosis was technically a ""grey area"" diagnosis - the doctors told me they estimated he had a 95-99% chance of dying right after birth, but there was always the chance he could survive. But even survival meant that he would be hooked up to machines until he was old enough to get a kidney transplant. To me, the decision came down to this: he was almost certainly going to die, no matter what I did. I just had to decide if he was going to die in utero, or after birth. If I chose to TFMR, the injection to stop his heart was akin to being anesthetized and never waking up - it would not be painful. But if he was born, he'd likely suffocate because his lungs were underdeveloped, or he'd die over the course of a few hours because his kidneys didn't work. That would certainly be painful. So I chose to TFMR, because it spared him from feeling pain and suffering.

I know this is such, such a hard decision. Likely the hardest one you'll ever make. Take the time you need to really think about it. I would definitely do the amnio to confirm a diagnosis before you make a decision. Amnio does carry a small risk of miscarriage, but it's very very small, and IMO it's worth the risk to get a firm diagnosis. NIPT does carry the risk of false positives so I would not choose to TFMR based solely on those results.

Please PM me if you want to talk further or have any questions about my experience in San Fran. I can give you the information of the doctors I saw.

I had a 8wk (by LMP) scan with heartbeat but they redated the pregnancy back by two weeks.  I grilled my doctor about the discrepancy and got the brush off. No offer for HCGs or a repeat scan or even a TVG scan (first was abdominal). Just, come back in a month.

At the 12 week scan there was no heartbeat. The baby had stopped growing literal days - like 3 - after my first scan. D&C 8/24. No serial HCGs offered at any point to date. 

F/u was 9/10. I took an OPK that morning and *thought* I was ovulating. I told my doctor and he said I could try if I wanted to that cycle (no AF yet) because the wait a cycle rule was just for dating purposes, but since I knew I was ovulating, we could track from there. He also said that many women ovulate within two weeks and that waiting actually increases the chances of infertility. 

In hindsight, And after doing my own research, I now know the positive OPK could have been residual HCG from the first pregnancy. He did not mention this possibility. 

So where I am now - I *think* I had negative OPKs and I *think* I had negative HPTs prior to TTC this month. But I didn‚Äôt save them, and now I‚Äôm second guessing myself as I am now trying to scrutinize these faint lines to confirm a pregnancy v residual HCG from the MMC. 

I looked at my office note today before calling in and that MF wrote ‚Äúok  to start trying after next menses.‚Äù Dude that is not what you said. Anyway, rant over. After confirming I had not yet had a period, he wrote me an order for a blood HCG today (yeah inexplicably just one) and I went and got that. I‚Äôm so over this practice. It‚Äôs just so bare minimum.

Anyway, I‚Äôm really sorry you‚Äôre having to go through this. I feel like everyone under the sun has been getting quantitative HCGs except for me.

I had a 8wk (by LMP) scan with heartbeat but they redated the pregnancy back by two weeks.  I grilled my doctor about the discrepancy and got the brush off. No offer for HCGs or a repeat scan or even a TVG scan (first was abdominal). Just, come back in a month.</p>

<p>At the 12 week scan there was no heartbeat. The baby had stopped growing literal days - like 3 - after my first scan. D&amp;C 8/24. No serial HCGs offered at any point to date. </p>

<p>F/u was 9/10. I took an OPK that morning and <em>thought</em> I was ovulating. I told my doctor and he said I could try if I wanted to that cycle (no AF yet) because the wait a cycle rule was just for dating purposes, but since I knew I was ovulating, we could track from there. He also said that many women ovulate within two weeks and that waiting actually increases the chances of infertility. </p>

After any ectopic, no matter what route you plan to take going forward, it is a great idea to get a HSG.

*I would want a more clear idea of why your doctor thinks you need to move to IVF right now. What they think your fertility issue IS. Do you have confirmed PCOS or just suspected? Do you ovulate on your own? Have you had progesterone checked on CD21 numerous cycles? Were your Clomid cycles monitored (blood tests and ultrasounds)? Has your husband had a semen analysis?*

If you were not previously conceiving without help, it is not incredibly likely that has changed. But it doesn't necessarily mean you need to move to IVF. Your first IUI did technically help you conceive...ectopics just happen and suck. =/

Low progesterone it not usually a reason for not conceiving (in and of itself).

Blood draws are a good route. 

The serial levels will let you know if it's going up (pregnancy at best case) or down (it's just your natural course that's just a little slower than average best case, or QGTD) 

Basically if it goes UP: if it's not a new pregnancy it's either retained tissue, in which case it needs to come out... Or it's a problem with the HCG cells multiplying in which case you gotta find from what. That's worst case, but it's all pretty treatable.

I just had a TFMR at 20 weeks about two weeks ago- so I‚Äôm still waiting for my body to normalize. I asked if they would do follow-up HCG and they were like ‚ÄúNo.‚Äù It seems to be practice specific, but based on other people‚Äôs comments on here it seems like they don‚Äôt do it routinely unless you‚Äôve had multiple losses or if there‚Äôs a concern for retained products. Some might if you ask, but for others it seems like if you just ‚Äúwait it out‚Äù for your next period things should normalize. 

I‚Äôm thinking of doing random HCG strips to see if I can see it trending down or get a ‚Äúnegative‚Äù before trying. I figure if my HCG is high I probably won‚Äôt ovulate anyway. 

Also- there‚Äôs no right/wrong about when you start trying again, they do it for dating reasons but you shouldn‚Äôt feel like you need to explain yourself for having sex with your husband before your numbers normalize.

I just had a TFMR at 20 weeks about two weeks ago- so I‚Äôm still waiting for my body to normalize. I asked if they would do follow-up HCG and they were like ‚ÄúNo.‚Äù It seems to be practice specific, but based on other people‚Äôs comments on here it seems like they don‚Äôt do it routinely unless you‚Äôve had multiple losses or if there‚Äôs a concern for retained products. Some might if you ask, but for others it seems like if you just ‚Äúwait it out‚Äù for your next period things should normalize. </p>

<p>I‚Äôm thinking of doing random HCG strips to see if I can see it trending down or get a ‚Äúnegative‚Äù before trying. I figure if my HCG is high I probably won‚Äôt ovulate anyway. </p>

<p>Also- there‚Äôs no right/wrong about when you start trying again, they do it for dating reasons but you shouldn‚Äôt feel like you need to explain yourself for having sex with your husband before your numbers normalize. I know I want to start trying again as soon as I can. If that makes dating less predictable, that‚Äôs a problem that I can deal with.</p>

<p>I called my doctor after another day of heavy bleeding and they almost kind of yelled at my that I should have called sooner. I had to get bloodwork done twice that week so see if the pregnancy was going to progress or not. Unfortunately, mine was a chemical pregnancy.</p>

We TFMR our very wanted pregnancy at 22 weeks due to HLHS. The fact that there are American politicians who weaponize a fetal heartbeat makes me see red. I'm so, so sorry for your loss.

You are not evil. You're not a murderer. You literally did the kindest thing you could for you and your baby. It's already a shitty decision, but it was the best of the shitty positions presented to you. But you know what I THINK is evil and cruel? Forcing women or couples to bring a dead or dying pregnancy to term when they don't want to, especially with the threat of actually harming the mother in the process. THAT, to me, is murder.

And even ending unwanted pregnancies are still a hard freaking decision. I had a friend who got pregnant WITH the IUD and a M2F trans partner on HRT. She clearly did her due diligence to close her uterus from baby making. The fact she got pregnant at all was borderline insane. She still discussed how emotionally and physically exhausting the procedure was. Terminating a pregnancy is NEVER a light decision, and I can't get over the idea anyone would think it is.

But if it's okay, I'd like to share my story on here as well. I live in Korea where the abort!on ban was recently deemed unconstitutional in 2019, but due to COVID, changing the law books is set to be toward the end of 2020 and hopefully be a ""lawful"" procedure by 2021. But despite its ""illegality"", many doctors are willing to perform the procedure, you just have to know a friend of a friend who will suggest one. I had to have a doctor I trust reach out to another doctor they knew who would perform it, reassuring both parties (us and this doc) that we wouldn't somehow screw over the other. I am a foreigner. I could be deported for a lot less. The doctor could be fined or receive jail time. It's shit.

Anyway, we had to pay in cash. There is no record of the procedure being done, and I was terrified the bank would ask why we were removing so much money at once. My hubs joked that he felt like a drug dealer, he'd never had so much hard money in hand. It was the only thing funny about that day. We arrived at the doctor's office, and the doctor and their nurses jumped into action the moment they saw us. They knew who we were... and we were treated with utmost kindness. The doctor asked if I wanted to see my baby one more time on the ultrasound, but I declined. They asked, didn't force. I'd already said my goodbyes.

I was induced for labor, given an epidural, dealt with labor pains for SIX HOURS, sedated for the D&E, and let me tell you... anyone who says terminating is easy can rightly go fuck themselves. I woke up from the procedure struggling to breathe, vomited twice, and was watched overnight. This care is significantly better than most would get, so I acknowledge my privilege that my experience, while awful, was tended with respect and care.

Here's the thing: when I told my dad, a conservative, religious type... he openly cried with me and supported my decision, and said NOTHING but loving kindness and sympathy to my husband and me. I'd always thought he was 100% anti-abort!on for any reason, but I think there's a difference to having a ""simple"" view on the world... and when it happens to your kid... kind of like McCain supporting his daughter's basic human rights as a lesbian. That's what changes people: when it happens close to home. When it's relevant.

Granted, in my journey to death acceptance and positivity, I think we should have choices, safe and legal ones, when it comes to pregnancy or ending one. Similar to how deathphobic we are as a society, we're also a bit... sexphobic and, well, sexist when it comes to biological female sexuality. We need information about fertility and pregnancy options EARLY and OFTEN. We need global acceptance of female autonomy and reproduction education.

I know how hard it is to extend compassion to these people, the ones who spit vitriol and malice in the face of your grief. But what I'd love to say to these people is, ""I hope, from the bottom of my heart, that you never have to make this decision. That this never happens to you. That you are never tested. Because this is awful, and your judgement only increases the stigma of this all too common phenomenon.""",[],,t1_g6stxuu,False,0,[],False,"<div class=""md""><p>I feel this so hard. We TFMR our very wanted pregnancy at 22 weeks due to HLHS. The fact that there are American politicians who weaponize a fetal heartbeat makes me see red. I&#39;m so, so sorry for your loss.</p>

<p>You are not evil. You&#39;re not a murderer. You literally did the kindest thing you could for you and your baby. It&#39;s already a shitty decision, but it was the best of the shitty positions presented to you. But you know what I THINK is evil and cruel? Forcing women or couples to bring a dead or dying pregnancy to term when they don&#39;t want to, especially with the threat of actually harming the mother in the process. THAT, to me, is murder.</p>

<p>And even ending unwanted pregnancies are still a hard freaking decision. I had a friend who got pregnant WITH the IUD and a M2F trans partner on HRT. She clearly did her due diligence to close her uterus from baby making. The fact she got pregnant at all was borderline insane. She still discussed how emotionally and physically exhausting the procedure was. Terminating a pregnancy is NEVER a light decision, and I can&#39;t get over the idea anyone would think it is.</p>

I don‚Äôt really get the logic behind this; and for me personally the whole reason I suspected I might be pregnant was some spotting before my period ( which I normally get) which then stopped rather than turning into a full period, so I knew something was up anyway. And I think most people who are tracking their cycles/trying know their bodies well and are going to pick up on things/want the info sooner rather than later.

There is no real advice to give on how to handle this situation and this is a terrible, heartbreaking decision to make. You need to think about what is best for your mental heath as well. I advise you to seek therapy if u have not already. It helped me tremendously with my grief. 

I am currently going Through my second MC and I will pass on advice that was giving to me from a nurse who has also suffered from multiple mc‚Äôs and has two living children. She said ( in terms of her pregnancies) that you can do everything right and things go wrong. you can do everything wrong and things go right. You never know with life. For some reason this stuck with me and made me feel a little better about my Mc especially knowing I did everything right in my pregnancies.

<p>There is no real advice to give on how to handle this situation and this is a terrible, heartbreaking decision to make. You need to think about what is best for your mental heath as well. I advise you to seek therapy if u have not already. It helped me tremendously with my grief. </p>

<p>I am currently going Through my second MC and I will pass on advice that was giving to me from a nurse who has also suffered from multiple mc‚Äôs and has two living children. She said ( in terms of her pregnancies) that you can do everything right and things go wrong. you can do everything wrong and things go right. You never know with life. For some reason this stuck with me and made me feel a little better about my Mc especially knowing I did everything right in my pregnancies. Just know you are doing everything you can for your little one.üíúüíúüíú</p>

In June of 2019 we terminated (I gave birth) to my son at 21 weeks and 5 days. 

He had myelomeningocele, his lesion was VERY large. He had all the associated diagnoses, chiari 2 malformation, lemon/banana sign... his brain ventricles were already above the normal limit for enlargement. Abnormal articulation of lower extremities. His skull was actually deformed because his spinal cord was tethered. 

He was a planned pregnancy. I was so scared of miscarriage because I had a terrible one before he was born. The farther along I got I was afraid of pre eclampsia, or gestational diabetes, etc. I had a low risk NIPT done that ruled out chromosomal issues which gave me and my OB false hope. 

At my anatomy scan the tech didn't say more than 5 words to me the whole appointment. She took probably 100 photos of his skull, stated she couldn't view his spine - I found it very odd she didn't have me go pee or reposition to try and get those images, but it makes sense now. She knew I'd be referred out. 

Honestly I knew his skull didn't look right in the photo she printed for me. I actually googled it. I spoke with SO and said maybe he has a cleft palate and that's why so many images of his head were being taken. 

I missed a call from my OB on a Friday night. He left me a voicemail. I know from being a nurse and having previous experience in OB that the doctor himself calling is a really bad sign. 

At this point I knew I was having a boy. SOs mom was so excited for her first grandson she cried when she found out. My mom had already begun buying him stuff. My daughter at the time was constantly talking about her baby brother because my stomach was getting big and she came to my appointments with me. We bought a fucking house for him. We had his room picked out. I set all the baby stuff aside in his room. He was planned and I remembered the night he was conceived. 

I was never offered the quad screen with AFP so this could have been caught earlier. 

I was so excited. I finally got to what I felt was the ""safe"" zone in pregnancy and started making baby registries and stuff. 

When my OB called me and told me it ""looks like"" the baby had spina bifida I politely declined having questions and just said OK. I was in shock. I didn't really k ow what that meant. I know what spina bifida is physically but really had no clue. 

Like you, I googled the hell out of it. Joined every Facebook group or discussion board I could find. 

It was so many hopeful stories. So many glimmers of hope. But the bad stuff I read I just couldn't shake. 

BTW for multiple reasons I was not a candidate for prenatal surgery. I was a stay at home mom to a 3 year old who was still nursing - she had never been without me literally ever. We JUST bought our house, SO is a business owner who cannot just leave. We do not have any children's clinics in our area or hospitals that perform the surgeries. I literally cannot up and leave my daughter and SO to go stay in a hospital until birth. And we do not have a level 4 NICU nor any specialities in my area for a child with significant medical needs, which Lincoln would have needed - lifelong no doubt. 

Everyone seems to just picture a baby as the light at the end of the tunnel. I couldn't help but to picture an adult living in that body. We're talking repeated surgeries, lifelong chronic pain, definitely OT/PT and likely wheelchair bound. The house we just bought isn't wheelchair accessible and probably could never be. No pediatric neurosurgeons here, no pediatric urologists, etc. I'm in Healthcare - I've taken care of adults with significant medical needs. I wouldn't wish that life on anybody. 

And what about me? What about my daughter? What about SO and my relationship? Those things would most definitely have to be sacrificed. Without a doubt. My daughters normal childhood would be gone. 

I don't care if I'm called selfish - the people here on earth and my mental health were more important. 

My OB was horrible. He made me wait almost 3 weeks (luckily I scheduled my anatomy scan super early) to see mfm and was visibly upset that I brought up termination if the prognosis was bad at MFM. I will never forget how he made me feel. He told me not to come back if I didn't proceed with the pregnancy. 
 
We wanted to bring Lincoln home so badly I cannot articulate it. I loved my unborn son deeply. I would have done anything to make him well. 

I was selfless and decided to let him pass in my arms to avoid the life he was destined for. 

The hospital I delivered at was wonderful. I sobbed uncontrollably for what I was going through - really for both of my children. My daughter that I knew was at home crying for me and for my son that I was essentially killing. 

He was delivered. He was alive and kicking. He looked just like his daddy. I've never seen SO cry in the 10 years we've been together but he sobbed as well. Lincoln lived for about 40 minutes. 

I was given his clothes, casts of his feet and footprints. We had him cremated. We have a birth and death certificate. His health insurance cards came in the mail a week later. I have his photos in my room. 

When he was gone I drove back home empty. 

The trauma that caused isn't possible to spell out. And my family never mentioned anything to me. I never got a hug, or a ""how are you?""... I didn't get shit. 

It changed me so deeply and significantly. I had to explain to my daughter that her baby brother was taken out of my stomach and died. 

She's the only one who says his name anymore. His bedroom is now her play room. 

It's such a unique pain. I am so thankful my son isn't here suffering. I'm thankful my life is normal. I don't feel bad saying that. Yes, I wanted a baby and I wanted Lincoln but I have the ability to look into the future and listen to the honest and truthful experiences of other parents and individuals with this defect. 

The worst part is - my family isn't complete. I was 35 when he was born and so happy to never have to be pregnant again. I knew termination may rip away our chances of ever completing our family. 

I'm 37 now. I've had 2 losses since. But we're still trying. 

I hope this helps you not feel so alone. I am here for you if you ever need someone.

<p>The hospital I delivered at was wonderful. I sobbed uncontrollably for what I was going through - really for both of my children. My daughter that I knew was at home crying for me and for my son that I was essentially killing. </p>

<p>He was delivered. He was alive and kicking. He looked just like his daddy. I&#39;ve never seen SO cry in the 10 years we&#39;ve been together but he sobbed as well. Lincoln lived for about 40 minutes. </p>

<p>I was given his clothes, casts of his feet and footprints. We had him cremated. We have a birth and death certificate. His health insurance cards came in the mail a week later. I have his photos in my room. </p>

<p>When he was gone I drove back home empty. </p>

<p>The trauma that caused isn&#39;t possible to spell out. And my family never mentioned anything to me. I never got a hug, or a &quot;how are you?&quot;... I didn&#39;t get shit. </p>

<p>It changed me so deeply and significantly. I had to explain to my daughter that her baby brother was taken out of my stomach and died. </p>

<p>She&#39;s the only one who says his name anymore. His bedroom is now her play room. </p>

<p>It&#39;s such a unique pain. I am so thankful my son isn&#39;t here suffering. I&#39;m thankful my life is normal. I don&#39;t feel bad saying that. Yes, I wanted a baby and I wanted Lincoln but I have the ability to look into the future and listen to the honest and truthful experiences of other parents and individuals with this defect. </p>

<p>The worst part is - my family isn&#39;t complete. I was 35 when he was born and so happy to never have to be pregnant again. I knew termination may rip away our chances of ever completing our family. </p>

<p>I&#39;m 37 now. I&#39;ve had 2 losses since. But we&#39;re still trying. </p>

<p>I hope this helps you not feel so alone. I am here for you if you ever need someone. </p>

<p>Please please look into the MTHFR mutation and taking methylated folate. </p>

<p>Lots of love to you.</p>

I have really been selective around who I lean on right now ( I‚Äôve been taking space from pregnant friends and new mothers, and people who don‚Äôt know how to talk to me and be normal with me).

I signed up for support with the PAIL network ( I live in Canada) and had a peer support person to speak to who also went through a similar loss. I found a therapist who specializes in pregnancy loss. I‚Äôm taking day by day. I have found that walks are really helpful. When I feel really sad and cry, I try to get up and go for a walk with my husband and it helps calm me. Some days I‚Äôm so low, and other days I start to feel glimmers of hope and optimism- and I get excited and nervous to try again.

The feeling of ""I was pregnant the last time I _____"" fades, and the more you do, the more time passes, the less it seems it triggers those feelings. When I was dealing with loss I would first just focus on each breath. Just get through one breath at a time. Then you can go to hours, days, and weeks... Before you know it a year will pass and you'll feel a lot better.

I've had two losses. My first was unplanned at 7 weeks, and I was making minimum wage, part time wages with massive student loan debt and I was about to lose my apartment. I had just a temporary job at the corporate Office of the company I was working part time for and trying to transition into a full time career where I could survive on my wages, and keep my apartment, but was still probably 5 years from considering having a family. I asked the father if he could get me on his insurance, and if he would be involved so I could work as much as I needed to to keep from drowning financially because there was no way I could afford food and diapers let alone childcare. He said no. My family lived out of state and they were all in debt because my brother was in late stage cancer treatment. I had no option, no help, and I hated that I had to do it. I couldn't even afford the time off work to deliver for adoption or I'd lose my job. I hate that it ever came to it, but I did what was best for them. I couldn't afford any prenatal testing, prenatal vitamins... or anything. I couldn't bring them into a world with a long fast fall face first into poverty with a mom who had no parachute and no dad in the picture. I lost my job anyway due to problems at work (my performance went down the drain due to blood loss) after returning the day after the D&C and spent a few months homeless as it was. It was absolute hell, despite being the best option with the information I had. I did it out of love, and anyone who doesn't understand that needs to check their privilege before they pass any judgement. 

The second, was a miscarriage at 9 weeks, very wanted, very planned. A baby I had spent 5 years preparing for - working 60 hour weeks to get on top of my finances, busting my ass, starting a business so I could have a more flexible schedule, and making sure my husband was able to help raise them. All that, just to lose them two weeks before my wedding. Even the wedding photos are tainted with the swollen belly that hurt to hold in. Then I spent 10 months with a rare disease from the miscariage that made everything so much harder to move on from. I even at one point thought it was karma for making the hardest decision if ever made 5 years before. I hope your healing journey is easier.

I finally started putting together a book of the pics and it was really healing. 

Any loss is incredibly hard. Please don't feel like the decision to terminate makes you a bad person. No one gets pregnant to have to go through that, it's always a decision the person carrying the child makes in the best interest of the child. I still feel a lot of guilt, despite knowing that I've done the best I could as a mom, but it does get easier. You made a decision out of love, and either way you went, you would probably struggle with the decision. 

I would recommend therapy. A loss is a hard enough trauma, but there's another layer to unpack with losses like yours and my first. Also, practice self care and allow yourself to be happy. You deserve to feel joy and happiness and love. You did the right thing with what you knew, take comfort in that.",[],,t1_g6kcn2v,False,0,[],False,"<div class=""md""><p>I am so sorry for you having to go through that. </p>

<p>The feeling of &quot;I was pregnant the last time I _____&quot; fades, and the more you do, the more time passes, the less it seems it triggers those feelings. When I was dealing with loss I would first just focus on each breath. Just get through one breath at a time. Then you can go to hours, days, and weeks... Before you know it a year will pass and you&#39;ll feel a lot better.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve had two losses. My first was unplanned at 7 weeks, and I was making minimum wage, part time wages with massive student loan debt and I was about to lose my apartment. I had just a temporary job at the corporate Office of the company I was working part time for and trying to transition into a full time career where I could survive on my wages, and keep my apartment, but was still probably 5 years from considering having a family. I asked the father if he could get me on his insurance, and if he would be involved so I could work as much as I needed to to keep from drowning financially because there was no way I could afford food and diapers let alone childcare. He said no. My family lived out of state and they were all in debt because my brother was in late stage cancer treatment. I had no option, no help, and I hated that I had to do it. I couldn&#39;t even afford the time off work to deliver for adoption or I&#39;d lose my job. I hate that it ever came to it, but I did what was best for them. I couldn&#39;t afford any prenatal testing, prenatal vitamins... or anything. I couldn&#39;t bring them into a world with a long fast fall face first into poverty with a mom who had no parachute and no dad in the picture. I lost my job anyway due to problems at work (my performance went down the drain due to blood loss) after returning the day after the D&amp;C and spent a few months homeless as it was. It was absolute hell, despite being the best option with the information I had. I did it out of love, and anyone who doesn&#39;t understand that needs to check their privilege before they pass any judgement. </p>

<p>The second, was a miscarriage at 9 weeks, very wanted, very planned. A baby I had spent 5 years preparing for - working 60 hour weeks to get on top of my finances, busting my ass, starting a business so I could have a more flexible schedule, and making sure my husband was able to help raise them. All that, just to lose them two weeks before my wedding. Even the wedding photos are tainted with the swollen belly that hurt to hold in.

I also decided to TFMR with an uncertain indication -- not SB, but a couple of different fetal abnormalities that could have led to a huge range of outcomes, from stillbirth to severe disability all the way up to potentially very manageable disability. I struggled so hard trying to decide what to do, and it is still super difficult for me to accept that I will never know what my baby's outcome would have been. In the end, though, I decided I couldn't take the risk. I was scared to sign up my baby (and myself!) for what might have been a lifetime of really severe complications.

I am just over 10 months out from my D&E. My physical recovery has been easier than I expected, and my emotional recovery has been harder and slower than I expected. I hope that you have an easier time, but if you don't, it might help to know that it's normal for this type of grief to take over for a while.

These are the choices that nobody wants. We all have to do our best with the information we have. Sometimes, that information isn't enough.

I just want to say that I see you, and I have been where you are, and I understand the love and the grit that it takes to make this kind of horrible decision in order to try to spare yourself and your baby and the people you love from an unknown future that could include an impossible amount of pain. And I also know that decision comes at a cost. It's very, very hard to live without these babies we give up, especially at first.

I also felt desperate to have another baby after I lost mine, but bad genetic news means I have to go the IVF route... and now I'm in a long pandemic-related holding pattern. It's hard to feel like I am losing the time, and I don't really have any coping suggestions other than 1) therapy and 2) getting through the days (or hours, or minutes) however you can.

I also decided to TFMR with an uncertain indication -- not SB, but a couple of different fetal abnormalities that could have led to a huge range of outcomes, from stillbirth to severe disability all the way up to potentially very manageable disability. I struggled so hard trying to decide what to do, and it is still super difficult for me to accept that I will never know what my baby&#39;s outcome would have been. In the end, though, I decided I couldn&#39;t take the risk. I was scared to sign up my baby (and myself!) for what might have been a lifetime of really severe complications.</p>

<p>I am just over 10 months out from my D&amp;E. My physical recovery has been easier than I expected, and my emotional recovery has been harder and slower than I expected. I hope that you have an easier time, but if you don&#39;t, it might help to know that it&#39;s normal for this type of grief to take over for a while. I didn&#39;t really notice any significant mood lightening until after I had passed my due date. And even now, I struggle A LOT with all of it, and with feeling really alone -- which is why I&#39;m so glad that you have reached out here and that people are directing you to some other resources.</p>

<p>These are the choices that nobody wants. We all have to do our best with the information we have. Sometimes, that information isn&#39;t enough. That shouldn&#39;t happen to anyone, but it happened to me, and it happened to you. I just want to say that I see you, and I have been where you are, and I understand the love and the grit that it takes to make this kind of horrible decision in order to try to spare yourself and your baby and the people you love from an unknown future that could include an impossible amount of pain. And I also know that decision comes at a cost. It&#39;s very, very hard to live without these babies we give up, especially at first.</p>

<p>I also felt desperate to have another baby after I lost mine, but bad genetic news means I have to go the IVF route... and now I&#39;m in a long pandemic-related holding pattern. It&#39;s hard to feel like I am losing the time, and I don&#39;t really have any coping suggestions other than 1) therapy and 2) getting through the days (or hours, or minutes) however you can. Be gentle with yourself, and give yourself more time than you think you&#39;ll need. This is a hard road. PM me any time you need to talk.</p>

However, I had to leave Facebook bc I still can‚Äôt tolerate unexpectedly seeing other pregnancy announcements and pictures of others babies.

Sometimes getting dressed up etc really helps - but sometimes you just need to go for it randomly. 

Also, it's obviously not for everyone and don't do this if you don't actively fancy it. But when I was still bleeding pretty heavily I gave my SO an impromptu blow job. I looked like shit and hadn't been having a particularly good day, but the idea struck and I just went with it. It felt really good to give him pleasure and to feel close to him physically without having to deal with my body etc. 

Thankfully my partner is very reciprocal and we've found ways to give me pleasure too since then. It can be such an amazing comfort in such a fucking bleak time of sadness - and such a great reminder of what you are as a couple despite what has happened.

If you have an infection or anything that needs to heal- that would probably be a good reason. But in the case of an ectopic that was just bad luck- as long as you don‚Äôt have a major pelvic infection/inflammatory condition that needs to be healed, there should be no reason why your other tube would be at any more risk this month versus two months from now. 

I know that there‚Äôs a lot of international literature that encourages longer times between pregnancies, but this is also a function of maternal-child health around the world. And to be honest, even in the US we have huge disparities. I do a lot of international medicine and when I‚Äôve worked in developing countries- both urban and rural- there has been the issue of women having back-to-back pregnancies, having poor access to nutrition/clean water/pre-natal care, and also simultaneously breast feeding more than one child where there are HUGE impacts on maternal and fetal health when there‚Äôs not enough time between pregnancies. However, I think for women who have access to medical care, do not have multiple (like 5-10) back-to-back pregnancies, poor nutrition, there is going to be little difference between one month and 3 or 4 months (assuming you‚Äôre not recovering from acute/chronic illness or have extenuating circumstances).  

At the end of the day- you know your body and your emotional state better than anyone. I would check in and just ask- point blank- if there is a specific reason they recommend 3 cycles or if that is just their general- (non-evidence based) recommendation.  

There is no doctor in the world who can promise you won‚Äôt have another ectopic or miscarriage because the fact is, no one can know.

From what I‚Äôve read it‚Äôs just to give you time to emotionally recover and so your cycle is more set in stone, so if you do get pregnant again you can easily see when your last period began etc. Everyone I know who has had a ruptured ectopic has been told slightly different things about when to start trying again- I recommend reading around (it‚Äôs really given me hope) and figure out how you feel physically and how you and your partner feel emotionally. I know the horrible wait for your periods to come back- but I promise you, you‚Äôll never be so glad to get your period as it will be a definite step towards trying again!! It‚Äôs a horrible wait but you can absolutely do it. Use this time to be selfish- relax and treat yourself. You‚Äôve gone through something hugely traumatic and your feelings are so valid. I wish you a speedy recovery- and I hope by this time next year we will BOTH be holding our rainbow babies üíú</p>

Our mind does weird things to us- and even when we *know* they are ludicrous thoughts, you can‚Äôt always stop the strange thoughts you have. I‚Äôm seeing a therapist, who I‚Äôve been seeing for unrelated trauma for about a year and that helps a lot.

It‚Äôs also important to know when your thoughts become really intrusive, start affecting your daily life, or you‚Äôre developing compulsions or behaviors that are new for you and are negatively impacting relationships/work/life. If you are suffering from PPA or depression- a therapist is great help, but you also might benefit from trying a medication short-term. I would definitely bring this up with your Ob/Gyn, I know mine has been super vocal about letting me know if I head into this territory so that they can treat it sooner rather than later. 

It‚Äôs OK to not be OK. I have to remind myself sometimes. This isn‚Äôt happening because you did anything wrong and it‚Äôs not happening because you‚Äôre doomed to a future of tragedy. Sometimes life is just a bit shitty- and it is completely unfair. But that doesn‚Äôt mean you have to suffer.

I am terrified that if Roe is overturned, it will be impossible to get an ab0rtion in many states, and even more impossible than it already is to have a late-term TFMR. 

And there are consequences for people experiencing other types of pregnancy loss to outlawing ab0rtion as well. For instance... making it more difficult to get misoprostol, like you mentioned. Or making it illegal to terminate an ectopic pregnancy. Or making a woman with PPROM wait until the baby's heart stops, putting her life in danger.

This is all absolutely terrifying and heartbreaking to me. My TFMR was 6 years ago and I have been scared about the future of reproductive rights in the US ever since, but now it's an EMERGENCY.

I don't know what to do besides keep donating to pro-choice organizations, call/write/text my representatives, and fight to elect pro-choice candidates. But it seems like there's nothing we can do about this SCOTUS pick and I am spiraling.

Edit: I just want to add that the most effective way I've found to teach people about why reproductive rights are so important, is to share my TFMR story with my family, friends and even the general public. If you've been through this, and you feel strong enough to do so, SHARE. I really think we change hearts and minds one at a time by sharing our pain. It's hard, and scary, and sometimes people have negative responses to it. But it's important.",[],,t1_g6ac4ws,False,0,[],False,"<div class=""md""><p>ALL. OF.  THIS.</p>

<p>I am terrified that if Roe is overturned, it will be impossible to get an ab0rtion in many states, and even more impossible than it already is to have a late-term TFMR. </p>

<p>And there are consequences for people experiencing other types of pregnancy loss to outlawing ab0rtion as well. For instance... making it more difficult to get misoprostol, like you mentioned. Or making it illegal to terminate an ectopic pregnancy. Or making a woman with PPROM wait until the baby&#39;s heart stops, putting her life in danger.</p>

I became aggressively prochoice after my experience with misoprostal and a D&C. When I had my EP I was horrified that in the US people have tried to mandate the transfer of an ectopic into the uterus, it's not possible (though anyone who has had an EP may wish otherwise). 

I have had two miscarriages that could have potentially killed me (one through sepsis, one by rupturing). Those medications and procedures are vital and need to be protected. I wish they were readily available for those who *want* them, to ensure they're there for those who *need* them.

And the medications and procedures are used for other things too. Misoprostal is used to manage post-partum haemorrhages and stomach ulcers. Methotrexate is a chemo drug and used to treat dermatitis (depending on the dosage). D&Cs are necessary for retained placentas, can be used to manage endo and as a diagnostic tool. Salpingectomies (the removal of fallopian tubes) are a form of permanent birth control.

The prolife movement isn't as loud here, and our government (at least in my state) listens to scientists and doctors regarding medical issues. What is purely a medical issue doesn't have room to be a political one here. And I am thankful every day for that.

There is a call out among my friends that if anyone needs support accessing those services, I have information, I will volunteer transport and hand-holding services.

I became aggressively prochoice after my experience with misoprostal and a D&amp;C. When I had my EP I was horrified that in the US people have tried to mandate the transfer of an ectopic into the uterus, it&#39;s not possible (though anyone who has had an EP may wish otherwise). </p>

<p>I have had two miscarriages that could have potentially killed me (one through sepsis, one by rupturing). Those medications and procedures are vital and need to be protected. I wish they were readily available for those who <em>want</em> them, to ensure they&#39;re there for those who <em>need</em> them.</p>

<p>And the medications and procedures are used for other things too. Misoprostal is used to manage post-partum haemorrhages and stomach ulcers. Methotrexate is a chemo drug and used to treat dermatitis (depending on the dosage). D&amp;Cs are necessary for retained placentas, can be used to manage endo and as a diagnostic tool. Salpingectomies (the removal of fallopian tubes) are a form of permanent birth control.</p>

<p>The prolife movement isn&#39;t as loud here, and our government (at least in my state) listens to scientists and doctors regarding medical issues. What is purely a medical issue doesn&#39;t have room to be a political one here. And I am thankful every day for that.</p>

<p>There is a call out among my friends that if anyone needs support accessing those services, I have information, I will volunteer transport and hand-holding services. I doubt I will ever find myself in a position where I feel I need to access those services, but damn it I will aggressively support those who do. Because my losses have shown me how important they are.</p>

I think this is totally up to you and to your emotional state of mind. If you were to get pregnant again and go through another loss- is that something you think you‚Äôre ready for? 4 miscarriages in back-to-back cycles would definitely make me wonder if there‚Äôs something going on that needs to be addressed before you can have a healthy pregnancy. At the same time, you‚Äôve had a healthy baby before so clearly your body is capable of it. Begs the question- some seriously terrible luck vs. something physiologically that needs to be addressed. 

I know that I have fears that being over 35, and just having gone through a TFMR at 20 weeks after an infertility journey, makes me terrified that all of my ‚Äúgood eggs‚Äù are gone. At the same time, I am ready to roll the dice again because I‚Äôm desperate to try and have a healthy baby (and sadly IVF isn‚Äôt financially in the cards for us at the moment). I think it‚Äôs super promising that you‚Äôre able to get pregnant and get through a few weeks- it definitely makes me think that there‚Äôs a higher probability that it‚Äôs not just your egg quality- but maybe something with supporting the pregnancy (uterine conditions, thyroid, progesterone, or blood factors). Or it could just be really really horrible luck. 

My heart aches for what you‚Äôve been through- but I also know that there‚Äôs no one that can make that decision right now except you. You have to balance the risk/reward for yourself- while you wait for more answers about what‚Äôs going on (RPL and other testing). The downside to going for it is that you could lose it- but not trying means you won‚Äôt have your desired outcome either. In my case, I‚Äôm 37 and feel like I don‚Äôt have time to lose- so I am playing TTC roulette and hoping there are some ‚Äúgood eggs‚Äù still left in there. 

If you feel ready and will only have peace of mind if you try- then go for it. If you think you‚Äôd feel more secure waiting for some results and giving yourself a short break from the high drama of TTC and early pregnancy, then maybe that‚Äôs your better option. It‚Äôs SO SO hard trying to make decisions when you don‚Äôt hold all of the facts yet- so trust your gut. Your body has been through a lot these past few months, so physically it might help your body and your uterus get prepped a little bit better if you give it a cycle or two. That said, if waiting or passing up your fertile window is going to cause you anxiety/stress, then you have to take that into consideration as well. 

I‚Äôm keeping my fingers crossed for you that you‚Äôve just had a terrible string of bad luck and your healthy rainbow baby is waiting for you!

<p>My heart aches for what you‚Äôve been through- but I also know that there‚Äôs no one that can make that decision right now except you. You have to balance the risk/reward for yourself- while you wait for more answers about what‚Äôs going on (RPL and other testing). The downside to going for it is that you could lose it- but not trying means you won‚Äôt have your desired outcome either. In my case, I‚Äôm 37 and feel like I don‚Äôt have time to lose- so I am playing TTC roulette and hoping there are some ‚Äúgood eggs‚Äù still left in there. </p>

<p>If you feel ready and will only have peace of mind if you try- then go for it. If you think you‚Äôd feel more secure waiting for some results and giving yourself a short break from the high drama of TTC and early pregnancy, then maybe that‚Äôs your better option. It‚Äôs SO SO hard trying to make decisions when you don‚Äôt hold all of the facts yet- so trust your gut. Your body has been through a lot these past few months, so physically it might help your body and your uterus get prepped a little bit better if you give it a cycle or two. That said, if waiting or passing up your fertile window is going to cause you anxiety/stress, then you have to take that into consideration as well. </p>

<p>I‚Äôm keeping my fingers crossed for you that you‚Äôve just had a terrible string of bad luck and your healthy rainbow baby is waiting for you! Sorry I don‚Äôt have any concrete advice for you except to do what YOU feel is best. Good luck- I‚Äôm crossing my fingers for you and sending lots of hugs!!</p>

I ended up starting to bleed on the day that I would have gotten my period. </p>

We were supposed to go to Japan in May and also a big sporting event this month, both were canceled due to covid. The sporting event was moved to next year so now we have the same problem.

I don't think there's anything wrong with taking a couple months off so you can go on this big trip. You planned when to start trying based on being able to go this year, and it is out of your control that it got moved. I really, really don't want to sell my ticket for this event next year. It is in a different country every year so the likelihood I can go in the future is low. 

Sorry this is getting long, lol. But my plan for the months we take a break is to focus on other things vaguely TTC related, like maybe trying to lose 5-10 lbs, eat a more fertility-friendly diet, start some new supplements, get in a better routine with exercise and just taking care and enjoying my body in general.

I feel very similar to you if it is any consolation.

Started trying earlier this year after coming off bc with a 'lets see what happens attitude' and got pregnant second cycle. At the time all I had looked up before starting is what day of the cycle ovulation is (thats how little I knew, even though I work in health science). I didn't know my cycle length because of bc so looking back probably also tested 3 days late too. Ended up having a MMC at 9.5 weeks, I too was alone when it was confirmed.

I also thought miscarriage was pretty much a 1 day thing- it took 5 weeks for my cycle to restart after D&C. I was sick of the sight of pregnancy tests after those weeks of keeping track of HCG. I felt nobody prepared me for having to wait so long and how crap it all is.

I was hopeful when my cycle started back as we could get going again and a number of people had said to me ( including a nurse in the hospital) that women are more fertile of MC and conceive very quickly. Well evidently that does not include me as fast forward to now and yesterday I just started cycle 4 post D&C.

I know way too much now- charting, symptom watching- I am totally obsessed. I wish I could go back to being so naive about it all. Knowing so much has made me super stressed which has stressed me out more as I am like will this stress effect ovulation! Talk about a vicious cycle!

I had actually stopped everything last month as I was so worked up. I felt better but then got AF 3 days early so I am now thinking I ovulated earlier so I don't think id recommend giving everything up as now I am bit clueless as to my cycles. I am going to try train my brain to switch off and try forget everything I know. If I figure it out I will let you know ha!

For myself I find it good to let myself feel how I am feeling so if I am angry/jealous/bitter I allow it. Whereas before I would have pushed it all away and tried to be a positive 'nice' person. I think we are taught by society that negative feelings are bad.

I have 4 friends who conceived 1st try and are having/had healthy pregnancies. I recently met up with some of them and found it very hard as they were talking about how quickly it happened for them and how surprised they were, MC had never even occurred to them (they didn't know about my MMC). I felt quite bitter in the moment but allowed myself to feel that way and then realised it was more that I was sad for myself than anything to do with them.

I think these feelings are only natural and for me it helps to allow myself feel them and be a hateful/bitter person for awhile- once I am not hurting anyone else. I keep thinking most people would feel the same, trying ttc is a big deal and is harder after a loss. Why wouldn't it effect us so much?!

<p>I think these feelings are only natural and for me it helps to allow myself feel them and be a hateful/bitter person for awhile- once I am not hurting anyone else. I keep thinking most people would feel the same, trying ttc is a big deal and is harder after a loss. Why wouldn&#39;t it effect us so much?!</p>

<p>Hope this helps and you&#39;re not alone.</p>

<p>I am sorry again and hope that you will be able to find comfort and support in this group‚ù§Ô∏è</p>

Got a BFP on 11DPO yesterday after two losses this year. First one was a chemical early in the year and second an MMC at 12/13weeks in May.

Took a few months for my body to work itself out but we were trying the whole time anyway. A whole whack of my good friends either had babies or very quickly and easily got pregnant with easy breezy pregnancies over this last year which has compounded my angst.

I had sworn to not test until a late period this cycle because the stark white negatives were so freaking awful, but I was literally losing sleep thinking about it. Tested with FMU on 11DPO and got a light but definitely there line. Test later same day was darker. Waited until later today 12DPO to test again and line is definitely still there, at least at dark as yesterday, so I am crossing my fingers hard. Those were all internet cheapies, saving the FRER until later.

Literally no symptoms, which is maybe somewhat odd because I had super sore nipples for the first two pregnancies before I had even missed a period... but hoping that maybe since I was technically pregnant for three months earlier this year, my boobs are like ok whatever we got this lol.

Slightly bitter that I am not my stupid dumbass self that I was skipping around like an idiot on my first ever positive before any of this went down, ignorant to everything and thinking losses were something that happened to other people, but secretly and conservatively happy that we have another chance.

For me, we had a list from my husband's workplace that was either local (in South Korea), online, or partnered with our insurance. I broke down the needs I was looking for (English speaking, specialties in bereavement, ptsd, self-esteem and body issues, online, and easy to send off to insurance for payment).

Since I've had therapists before, I already kind of had an understanding with how I'd like my sessions to go, and I think it's important to know what it is you're looking to get out of a therapy session and what to look for in a therapist. 

For example, I started with a large idea (grief counseling over pregnancy loss), and then broke it down to smaller ideas (wanting a therapist to navigate anxieties for future pregnancies, dealing with body image issues, being more open to grieving and expressing my feelings to myself and others, obsessive tendencies and the desire to be in control, etc.). Basically, the more you have an idea of how you want to navigate your grief and loss, the better your therapist can help you heal and manage the grief if/when it comes up.

I think a good way to start the search is to look up therapists online who specialize in grief counseling, maybe even with a focus on MC or child loss. You're in no way obligated to stay with a therapist if it doesn't feel like a good fit, but doing research ahead of time will lessen that possibility.

Long answer: There's a lot of things that are and are not PCOS that can cause menstrual cycles to go wonky. Without getting professionally evaluated, there's no way to know for certain - but even a standard GYN doc would most likely screen you for PCOS and other things with a 48 day cycle in your history.

I also assume an RE would have this conversation with you, but I know those can be way harder to book.  


I would assume they'd think about the following:

1. Bloodwork for PCOS (testing testosterone and other androgens, and also LH, FSH, and progesterone), for thyroid issues (TSH/T4), and also a measure of prolactin, possibly others.
2. Ultrasound imaging of your ovaries
3. Pelvic exam, also looking for other clinical signs (PCOS might have excess body hair, for example).

 Have you had your HCG checked after d&e and/or had a negative pregnancy test yet? The OPK will not be reliable until the HCG is out of your system. I still got a faint positive around 30+ days after D&C.
