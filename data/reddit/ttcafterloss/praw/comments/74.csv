Edit as promised: [here's](https://www.reddit.com/r/ttcafterloss/comments/8oxhwc/milk_came_in_after_tfmr_just_now_freaking_out_a/) the post about physically coping with milk coming in.  Different people did different things.  You can see what works for you.  The sooner you start, the better your boobs will feel.

To your main question, pregnancy after loss isn't the same.  Some women with early losses feel better once they've reached the 2nd tri.  With later losses like mine or yours, it's more common to feel like there's never a ""safe"" point.  But I think everyone at least has moments to enjoy (like the kicks!), and weeks that are tough (especially the weeks around when a previous loss occurred).  When you're ready, there's a book called ""Pregnancy After Loss"" that you might find helpful.  But right after my loss, I found bereavement counseling, and a parent support group for perinatal loss most helpful.

I then waited an excruciating week to find out if I ovulated late or if my baby was not going to make it. So, accurate dating became super important to me after that. I waited til first period and then also bought one of those Ava bracelets so I could track ovulation (I had no success with OPKs for some reason). My cycles were very jacked following the MMC, and I did ovulate a week late with my current pregnancy, so while I measured 9 days behind LMP at my first scan, he was only 2 days behind ovulation. He‚Äôs since caught up and is in the 58th percentile as of the last growth scan.</p>

Got a positive test on February 4. Lmp was 1/11. Saw baby‚Äôs hb at 8 weeks and things looked perfect.

Us that afternoon showed baby had no hb and was measuring at about 9w. I had a d&c last Thursday 4/4 because I wanted to be able to speed things up and I was afraid of the pain of passing the baby at home. 

I am so, so sorry for your loss. It really sucks. I am looking forward to trying again too but also trying to keep my expectations in check which I know will be hard. I have a follow up with the obgyn surgeon next week and I plan to really talk her ear off. When I was lying in the hospital bed after the d&c she said I could get pregnant even before my next period and while this is awesome news, my now anxious mind is afraid my uterine lining won‚Äôt be healthy and this could result in a chemical pregnancy. 

I scheduled my first fertility acupuncture appointment for next week. I am weirdly excited..I‚Äôve never really delved into eastern medicine but I‚Äôve heard good things and at this point I‚Äôll do anything to up our chances of quickly conceiving again and preventing miscarriage. 

Wishing you lots of luck and good vibes as you continue your journey. I like to think about one day looking back and telling my future child about this struggle and how BADLY we wanted him or her and how it made us into the parents we are (will be).

I have found a lot of comfort on this community too. I just had my second MMC, and after expectant management for my first MMC, I opted for a D&C yesterday. 

My first MMC was 2 years ago and baby hadn't grown beyond 6w4d with a very slow heartbeat. The imaging centre didn't give me any options for dealing with the loss other than to just wait it out. Not knowing any better, I did. I found the expectant management really, really difficult to deal with: I didn't have much information about what was happening or why I had miscarried or how long this process would take. I ended up having to wait for 4 weeks for my body to pass the pregnancy and the bleeding and passing of the embryonic sac scarred me for months afterwards.  

This time I was more well informed. I found out I was pregnant beginning of March and after my 8 week dating scan a week ago only showed an embryo that had grown to 5w6d with no heartbeat, I knew it was happening again. My doctor referred me to the early pregnancy assessment clinic at my local hospital - they confirmed the MMC yesterday with another scan, gave me all of my options and at my request, scheduled me in for a D&C that very afternoon. It all went well; I am bleeding, but nothing like when I let it come naturally. Despite how devastated I feel and the depression that is clawing at me, I found myself overwhelmed yesterday with the kindness of all the nurses and doctors and full of gratitude for our public health system in Australia.

I hope it's ok to introduce myself and my story on this thread.

I'll tell my story - hopefully I can make it a short version! I came off the pill in July to conceive my first child with my husband, and we took a 'not preventing' stance as I didn't want to get too hung up on it. On January 5 I took a pregnancy test, it was positive, and I was 5 weeks. I was amazed to get pregnant that cycle as my husband's mother was dying of cancer throughout November and passed away at the end of that month, and we weren't in a very frisky place. So the one time we had sex in December we conceived.

I was nervous all throughout these early weeks and I wonder did I know something was wrong deep down. I had very sore boobs and was tired, but no other major symptoms. I did everything I could ensure I was healthy though - taking all the vitamins, changing my diet, cutting down on strenuous exercise, getting more sleep. I was so excited, along with my husband, but also cautious until I heard a heartbeat.

Sadly that day never came. On February 9, at a ten week scan, I heard that dreaded silence while the sonographer desperately searched. Was I sure about my dates!? My should have been ten week old embryo was measuring only 6+1 and no heartbeat. At a follow up scan 12 agonising days later, they confirmed the diagnosis of a missed miscarriage, and booked me in for a D&C the following day, Friday February 22.

The procedure could not have gone smoother for me. I checked in at 6.45, went under before 9, and was home by lunch. I bled for 6 days and it was only heavy for the first day. 38 days after the D&C my period returned on April 1. The first period was mostly light and was finishing up by April 5 (our fifth wedding anniversary).

So, we TTC! I had short cycles (approx 23-25 days) after coming off the pill, so don't know where my body is at now ovulation wise. So I started OPKs on Saturday, Day 6 to get a better picture of things. I'm so hopeful to conceive again soon and have this one stick. My due date would have been September 7, and I know its unhealthy but I really feel I won't be okay if I'm not pregnant again by the due date. My husbands brothers wife had her fourth child two weeks ago, and a week after that, his other brothers wife announced she was expecting her second (and will be 6 weeks behind where I would have been).

I want to rewind everything and make it not happen. TW? And a long post, I‚Äôm musing on feeling shitty and not really censoring, please pass this by if that won‚Äôt help you. 

D&C is tomorrow and woke up feeling not even sad exactly just heavy and listless. Crying helped before but I just feel dull, like I‚Äôve run out of things to cry about. I‚Äôve been fighting it all week but I think I internally agree with my asshole friend who told me it wasn‚Äôt a real baby. It should be.

I couldn‚Äôt stop myself from saying something about I‚Äôm so relieved and happy I was afraid they wouldn‚Äôt find anything ...then that terrible shitty silence. That was it.  They showed us the baby but not the heartbeat. 

Just fuck everything about this, I hate it. I hate that so many people have to go through this. It‚Äôs nobody‚Äôs fault but it just feels so cruel. I hate that there are so many people who have had to learn exactly how it feels. Trying to get pregnant and all the ups and downs of waiting for the cycles, and hopes being dashed, that was bad enough.  There actually was a baby.

There‚Äôs still this irrational bit in the back of my head that says if I don‚Äôt go in tomorrow there would still be a chance. There would not. 

Not that I trust my body to do a damn thing on its own with the right timing. My cycles have been totally off ever since I stopped birth control Iike 4 years ago. Waiting for it to do its thing naturally with this just makes my skin crawl. 

The pill doesn‚Äôt sound like it would work for me either. It would do what it was supposed to do, but with the kind of anxiety and panic I get from just stupid everyday physical injuries, I would probably feel like I was actually dying and end up making my husband take me to the hospital anyway. (I would not make a good home birth candidate when the time comes)

The procedure is the best awful choice I suppose. I hope it comes with some closure. In exchange for my entire deductible for the year, just to add insult to injury. At least it‚Äôs technically still covered?

My husband has been completely wonderful, I‚Äôve never been so thankful for him as I am now. We just talked some, I asked him to explain how it was real. Something that hit home for me is that all these physical changes that start even early on center around defending the baby and fighting for it, being a mama bear. And that I am being a good mama bear, even now, that‚Äôs why I‚Äôm feeling all of this so strongly, there‚Äôs just nothing I can do now.

Men's sperm sensitizes the woman's immune response. This is consistent across studies conducted by men and women. The effect is both dramatic and consistent. Now, while I don't think the study you are mentioning is ethical (my own personal, moral beliefs -- I don't want anyone to say tathougies is endorsing this study's findings), it is a clearly documented fact that semen exposure improves pregnancy outcomes. While, to my knowledge, only a few studies have directly measured its effect on miscarriage in particular, given the dramatic effect of semen exposure in pre-eclampsia and other conditions hypothesized to be immune mediated, as well as the seeming success of certain immune treatments intended to cure some hypothesized incompatibility with the male partner, it seems a bit premature to be so dismissive.

This is also why sperm donation pregnancies (as well as pregnancies started by sperm surgically extracted through TESE, to a lesser extent) have higher risks than a pregnancy occurring from fertile semen, which, again, has something in it that we do not understand that reduces pregnancy complications.

Honestly, I'm not sure what this post was meant to do. Men's bodies are empirically shown to work with a woman's -- in sex -- to make pregnancy work better than a simple egg-meets-sperm scenario (which we've now been able to separate from sex). Dismissing these out of hand because of some kind of gender battle is silly and does not serve any foreseeable purpose on a forum for those who want to avoid miscarriage.

But, since the gender of the researcher seems to be a major issue for you. I did research the [original article](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0165037818302183) that I imagine your daily mail article refers to (BTW, daily mail is not a reputable scientific journal). The main author is listed as T Meuleman from Leiden University in the netherlands. Dr Meuleman seems to write prolifically on immunity and pregnancy and Leiden university is a well respected institution. A bit of research seems to indicate that Dr Meuleman is, in fact, female: her full name is Tess Meuleman, a woman. In fact, you can see on her profile, that she is, indeed, female: [https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Tess\_Meuleman](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Tess_Meuleman).

This one was by a woman - [Dr Dimitra Kyrou](https://www.embryoland.gr/en/pages/monada/doctors/dimitra_kyrou_MD.asp))",[],,t1_ekau31d,,0,,False,"<div class=""md""><p>Vaginal exposure to semen has, in multiple studies, been linked to lower rates of pregnancy complications, like pre-eclampsia. Men&#39;s sperm sensitizes the woman&#39;s immune response. This is consistent across studies conducted by men and women. The effect is both dramatic and consistent. Now, while I don&#39;t think the study you are mentioning is ethical (my own personal, moral beliefs -- I don&#39;t want anyone to say tathougies is endorsing this study&#39;s findings), it is a clearly documented fact that semen exposure improves pregnancy outcomes. While, to my knowledge, only a few studies have directly measured its effect on miscarriage in particular, given the dramatic effect of semen exposure in pre-eclampsia and other conditions hypothesized to be immune mediated, as well as the seeming success of certain immune treatments intended to cure some hypothesized incompatibility with the male partner, it seems a bit premature to be so dismissive.</p>

<p>This is also why sperm donation pregnancies (as well as pregnancies started by sperm surgically extracted through TESE, to a lesser extent) have higher risks than a pregnancy occurring from fertile semen, which, again, has something in it that we do not understand that reduces pregnancy complications.</p>

<p>Honestly, I&#39;m not sure what this post was meant to do. Men&#39;s bodies are empirically shown to work with a woman&#39;s -- in sex -- to make pregnancy work better than a simple egg-meets-sperm scenario (which we&#39;ve now been able to separate from sex). Dismissing these out of hand because of some kind of gender battle is silly and does not serve any foreseeable purpose on a forum for those who want to avoid miscarriage.</p>

<p>But, since the gender of the researcher seems to be a major issue for you. I did research the <a href=""https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0165037818302183"">original article</a> that I imagine your daily mail article refers to (BTW, daily mail is not a reputable scientific journal). The main author is listed as T Meuleman from Leiden University in the netherlands. Dr Meuleman seems to write prolifically on immunity and pregnancy and Leiden university is a well respected institution. A bit of research seems to indicate that Dr Meuleman is, in fact, female: her full name is Tess Meuleman, a woman. In fact, you can see on her profile, that she is, indeed, female: <a href=""https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Tess_Meuleman"">https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Tess_Meuleman</a>.</p>

My insides started to feel toxic and sick so I scheduled a D&C. I opted for general anasthesia because I have bad PTSD and anxiety and I was too emotional for just a wiff of Ativan in office procedure. 

The anasthesologist, nurses, and surgeon were incredible. I felt so cared for, respected, and at ease from the minute I did my pre-op appointment. The anasthesologist gave me some pain medicine and anxiety medicine in my IV and I don't remember anything else. I hardly remember leaving the pre-op area. I didn't have much pain, I spotted for about a week after. I only needed ibuprofen for mild cramping. 

I'm only three weeks out and I'm waiting for my first period which I think will be next week. I have been tracking the lines of pregnancy tests every few days just to make sure my HCG is decreasing. At about three weeks post D&C I can barley see a line at all. 

I had a really good experience with the D&C under anasthesia. I know some people want to take the pills and deal with it at home. I have heard that the pills are painful and it can be really bloody/graphic passing the tissue and fetus.

Having a natural MC, and seeing the blood and clots and thinking ""those are parts of my baby"" made it that more distressing, I think. With the D&C, it was over and done with. I had essentially no pain afterwards (just a little crampy so I took 3 Tylenol which helped) and very little bleeding. I was totally fine that evening.

It was done under ""twilight sleep."" I've heard of people doing it with just a local anesthetic or actually nothing which in my opinion is totally insane, so talk to your doctor beforehand about what kind of anesthesia they're using and don't be afraid to ask for what you want. You can also ask your OBGYN for them to test the...results of your D&C to see if there were any chromosomal abnormalities.

It did take a little longer than usual for my period to come back. I got my D&C on February 7 and got my period on March 23.

&#x200B;

I'm not currently trying to conceive, because I am getting really in-depth genetic testing with a fertility specialist (beyond what my OBGYN did) and a couple other tests (checking out my fallopian tubes, etc.) and you have to wait until after you get your first period after your MC/D&C to do that. But--when I went back for my 2-week follow-up with my OBGYN, she said I could start trying if I wanted to (although my HCG wasn't at 0...it's actually STILL at 5...in order to be considered totally not pregnant it needs to be BELOW 5. Sigh).

&#x200B;

FWIW, it's BS that you need to wait because it makes another MC more likely, although some doctors recommend waiting 1-2 weeks to avoid infection. The only real reason to wait is if you can't handle it emotionally.

Best of luck. So sorry you're going through this.",[],,t1_ek78j2t,False,0,[],False,"<div class=""md""><p>I had one natural miscarriage (around 4/5 weeks) and one D&amp;C (around 8 weeks). I was leery of the D&amp;C--it is surgery, after all--but I&#39;m so glad I did it. Frankly, it kind of made the grieving process easier. Having a natural MC, and seeing the blood and clots and thinking &quot;those are parts of my baby&quot; made it that more distressing, I think. With the D&amp;C, it was over and done with. I had essentially no pain afterwards (just a little crampy so I took 3 Tylenol which helped) and very little bleeding. I was totally fine that evening.</p>

<p>&#x200B;</p>

<p>It was done under &quot;twilight sleep.&quot; I&#39;ve heard of people doing it with just a local anesthetic or actually nothing which in my opinion is totally insane, so talk to your doctor beforehand about what kind of anesthesia they&#39;re using and don&#39;t be afraid to ask for what you want.

I felt so alone after the first miscarriage and it wasn‚Äôt until a few months after when I attended the support group that I realized so many of us experienced this and we are all here for each other. Someone in my group mentioned that this is like a club that no one talks about and no one wants to belong to. But unfortunately we do and the best thing we can do is be there for each other. Sending you lots of hugs and comfort in knowing you are not alone. Feel free to message me if you want to chat. </p>

After 2 rounds of IVF we finally had success and have an age gap of just over 4 years between our boys. I can‚Äôt tell you how perfect it has been. Our boys absolutely love each other and play together all the time. The oldest is able to keep himself entertained when I need to take care of the youngest and has had zero jealousy issues. He also loves helping take care of his brother whenever he can and our little guy idolizes our oldest. Closeness between them has never been an issue and things are so much less chaotic than if I had had two that were closer in age. I never realized, but my sanity is so much better off this way.

On top of this, my older brother and sister are 4 years apart and have always been best friends. My sister and I, (3 years apart), not so much. My little brother is 8 years younger than me and we played a ton as kids and hang out all the time now. So much can come down to personality. Some siblings don‚Äôt get along regardless of age gap, some are just made to be awesome together - whether they‚Äôre 1 year or 10 years apart.

<p>After 2 rounds of IVF we finally had success and have an age gap of just over 4 years between our boys. I can‚Äôt tell you how perfect it has been. Our boys absolutely love each other and play together all the time. The oldest is able to keep himself entertained when I need to take care of the youngest and has had zero jealousy issues. He also loves helping take care of his brother whenever he can and our little guy idolizes our oldest. Closeness between them has never been an issue and things are so much less chaotic than if I had had two that were closer in age. I never realized, but my sanity is so much better off this way.</p>

<p>On top of this, my older brother and sister are 4 years apart and have always been best friends. My sister and I, (3 years apart), not so much. My little brother is 8 years younger than me and we played a ton as kids and hang out all the time now. So much can come down to personality. Some siblings don‚Äôt get along regardless of age gap, some are just made to be awesome together - whether they‚Äôre 1 year or 10 years apart. Don‚Äôt let the gap get you down, it will not keep your family from being any more amazing than it‚Äôs already going to be!</p>

<p>(CW: mention of LC and everyone else‚Äôs pregnancies and LC‚Äôs) I went to pick up my LC from daycare after a night away. I was taking to the provider (it‚Äôs a small home daycare) and she told me the mother of the baby (she just turned one) she was holding is pregnant and already knows the gender. She can only have two under two in her care at any time and another mom there just gave birth. That literally means I won‚Äôt have her as a childcare option until January of 2021. She then asked me ‚Äúwell when are you planning to get pregnant again anyway?‚Äù üôÑüôÑ. I basically told her good question and I obviously don‚Äôt know. Then I grabbed my LC and cried the whole way home and have basically been a mess ever since. </p>

I experienced a natural miscarriage at 10w on March 17th and it happened very fast. 

I had spotting off and on, very light, sometimes only for a day for about a week in total. Then I noticed that spotting changed colour; originally just a little pink then turn to brown usually but it started to turn dark red.

I felt discomfort, not pain, just like I couldn't get comfortable. 

Then I felt, what I can only describe as the very beginning of period cramps, right across my lower abdomen. I went to lie down and could find no comfortable position at all. After about 30 minutes, the pain became so unbearable I felt like I was going to vomit from it. Still all across my abdomen. 

I finally called up my husband and took some fast acting Tylenol and fell asleep, exhausted from the pain. All in all, that pain only lasted about an hour. Then I would pass bits of tissue over there next day or two and that was that.

If you don't make it to your appointment, if you feel cramps coming on, take some extra strength Tylenol, and stay home. 

I want to tell you to try your best to prepare for your hormone levels to drop. To go from all this pregnancy hormone to lower and lower levels can make you feel very empty, very sad, very much like a shadow.

Although we are happy for them, they were also dealing with infertility like us, but all the milestones they hit happily, hit us with a ton of bricks to the chest.  I&#39;ve deleted Facebook and muted all people with children on instagram. It all just sucks. </p>

I had a full-term stillbirth (39 weeks, 4 days) in August 2018. I had an uncomplicated pregnancy, went into labor with gradually increasing contractions one morning, everything seemed fine - and when I got to the hospital they couldn‚Äôt find a heartbeat. We declined an autopsy because in the moment I couldn‚Äôt bear the thought of it and my daughter‚Äôs umbilical cord was wrapped so tightly twice around her neck it seemed likely that restricted blood flow during labor was the cause (though I suppose I‚Äôll never know for sure).

I think it was three days later that I told my husband I wanted another baby right away. I can‚Äôt explain it, but the desire for another baby was immediate and strong. My OB recommended waiting 4-6 months, but one of my best friends is also an OB and told me that after a vaginal delivery with no complications (I had none, other than a few stitches, and all of my testing came back normal), you‚Äôre considered out of the postpartum period at 6 weeks and there‚Äôs not really any increased risk with another pregnancy at that point.

I ended up getting pregnant again in October around 10 weeks postpartum. I saw a heartbeat at 6 weeks but then started lightly spotting at 8 weeks and discovered the baby had stopped growing at 7 weeks. Had a d&c in December. We waited until after my first period and started trying again right away in January. I‚Äôm in ttc cycle 4 now, and I‚Äôve had spotting issues since the miscarriage so I‚Äôve recently started progesterone to see if it will help. 

This very long history is just to say that I felt both times like I wanted to try again right away. Despite the emotional mess after my stillbirth, I felt strong physically and like my body could handle it. I have to acknowledge that I have two living children and had no previous losses, so I have a lot of confidence in my body‚Äôs ability to deliver a baby successfully. I‚Äôm not sure how I would feel if my stillbirth was my first pregnancy. It could also be a factor that I‚Äôll be 35 this year, and I‚Äôm currently a SAHM and worried about putting off a return to my career for an extended amount of time. I am also comforted by my OB‚Äôs plan for dramatically increased monitoring and early induced delivery for my next pregnancy whenever that happens.

There are so many factors that go into deciding what‚Äôs right for you. Sometimes I wonder if getting pregnant so soon after my stillbirth was a factor in my subsequent miscarriage, but my OB doesn‚Äôt think so and there‚Äôs no way to know for sure. What it comes down to for me is that I feel physically strong, I know in my bones that I want another baby, and I have a support system in place to help me through the anxiety and fear that I know another pregnancy will probably bring, especially at the later stages.

Just a truly awful feeling.

I'm getting the sense that D&C procedures seem to vary a lot depending on your doctor and what kind of anesthetic/pain medication you're given. Do you know how your doctor performs yours?

We tried to do mine under oral sedation (so I took a Percocet and a Xanax an hour before my procedure and they used a local anesthetic to numb around my cervix, but I was totally awake and pretty lucid during). It didn't work because I have a funny uterus, and they couldn't quite reach where the pregnancy was without totally torturing me. I ended up needing to go to the hospital and be put under general anesthesia, which went very smoothly. They put in my IV, I hung out in a bed for a bit, then they took me into the OR, knocked me out, and I woke up shortly afterwards feeling a little disoriented but not bad.

I've been lightly spotting today and had a little headache (maybe from all the different drugs/anesthesia or maybe from not eating or drinking much yesterday), but overall I feel fine. I'm a little tired and have been taking it easy.

I agree with Sea\_Tart about moving it up, if you want to and are able. I was relieved to be able to have mine done as soon as possible because waiting just felt weird to me. I feel relieved that it's over, and, while I'm obviously still sad, I feel like I can start to look forward a bit now with the procedure behind me.

I didn't do a D&C, I took misoprostol for my MMC, but my follow-up was scheduled more than 2 weeks out from the time I took the pills, doc said that was standard timing and not much of use could be done before then.

I'm supposed to go get an ultrasound to confirm completion of my mc, and a bunch of blood tests for my follow-up.

I was diagnosed with HELLP syndrome at 23+4 and ultimately delivered at 23+5. My son also was too small to survive. I had an emergency c section too, was yours classical or transverse if you don‚Äôt mind me asking?

I was initially recommended a period of a year (10-11 months at earliest) before TTC again. I have since seen my doctor and gotten the approval, or rather, lack of disapproval, if I start TTC at the end of May this year. However there is a lot of healing to be done, mentally and physically. 

Physically: do your exercises. They will make you ache initially but you need to get strong again. I refrained from anything evenly remotely strenuous for 7 weeks; I‚Äôm pretty sure that I didn‚Äôt even unload the dishwasher. Further down the line, I‚Äôm talking 3 months, look at long term health goals such as losing weight or eating more healthily. But for now, triage the acute grief first. 

Mentally: see a therapist, keep a journal, find a support group. Talk about what happened. Talk about your son. My OB told me if I tried to hide from it, it would come back to get me sooner or later. Give yourself permission to feel your feelings and do not let others try to tell you how to grieve. 

But please, give yourself time. I know it is hard to hear - I know I hated hearing those words. I wanted to be pregnant again immediately. But I‚Äôm glad I waited. I‚Äôm six months out and just starting to feel like my life is sewn back together again. The pain of waiting doesn‚Äôt go away, but the sting goes out of it the longer time flows on. 

Those c section scars are nothing to mess with and you really don‚Äôt want to put yourself or another baby at risk. Current studies say a higher risk of a negative outcome is associated with conception occurring six months or sooner after a c section. And you will need that time for yourself and your husband to be well. I know it might seem unbearable now, but in a few months you will look back and wonder where the time went. Keep in contact with your doctor, depending on your own healing rate they might give the go ahead before a year if they are satisfied.

I didn't know I had endo, my dr said it could be a possibility because the radiologist reported the two cysts appeared to be endometrial cysts.

My doc also said the cysts were probably there for a while, before my miscarriage. They probably just grew and became irritated maybe after my miscarriage. 
I'm feeling much better than I thought I would, after this surgery. I stopped the pain pills today and I'm sticking with taking Motrin. I want to see how it goes. The small incisions are sensitive and a little itchy but nothing bad. She glued them together, so I don't need any stitches removed. I am spotting a little but she said that's normal. No cramps, just tenderness. I do have discomfort from the air they put in me during surgery, its still finding its way out. It's sitting under my diaphragm and ribs and shoulder areas. The nurse said the more I move around the faster it will get released, burping helps a lot. lol
She said we can start TTC whenever I feel ready. I wish I could this week, since I am ovulating. lol But it's too soon. 
My doc said its a 6 week recovery, so I gradually have to get back into my regular activity and lifting things. But today I am up and walking around slowly, feeling pretty good. going to a seated position and getting up from a seated position, I have to take my time. I just can't lift anything.

There are a million reasons why miscarriages happen, and falls account for very few.</p>

<p>&#x200B;</p>

<p>Regardless of the cause, I know it&#39;s so devastating to lose a baby under any circumstances, and having to go through it alone is brutal. I strongly recommend that you find a therapist to talk this out with; I needed therapy for about four months after my loss and it made a huge difference. I&#39;m so sorry.</p>

It's been rough TTC since I have only had 2 cycles since then (ovulating? Not? Who knows?) and 2 of my close friends are pregnant. 

My one BFF is due in June. She announced her pregnancy about a month after my MC. I knew she had been TTC #2 for 5 to 6 months so it wasn't really a surprise and she was very comforting about it. A lot of ""I understand if you don't want to talk about it or if it makes you sad but I'm still there if you need me"". She never brings up anything pregnancy related unless I initiate. I distanced myself for a couple months when she started showing because it did make me emotional but she has been such a great support through all of this trauma that it felt natural to reach out to her when I was having panic attacks about other pregnancy announcements, OPKs all over the place, and just overall stress. It gives me a little twinge when I see her belly but it makes me really happy that I will basically have another niece/nephew in a few months, and her 2yo makes me remember why we are TTC in the first place.

My other friend who I used to be super close with is less considerate. We used to live together in college and the group of us girls like to meet up every once in a while and keep a group text going. She had tons of questions while I was pregnant and she had said they would TTC this summer but I guess after news of a close friend's MC why wouldn't you get a headstart right? She announced a couple months ago she is due at the end of August and flaunts it. I wish I could be happier for her but it almost makes me sick when she complains about how big she's getting or how she can't come out to things because she is ""too pregnant"". We used to do some exercising together and the group of girls from college all run so we were going to sign up for a fun 5k together but she kept saying ""I'll be too big by then so I'll pass"". Mind you, I was running and lifting throughout my pregnancy and planning on running (or at least jogging/walking) up until labor. I had all these grand plans of Instagram pregnancy fitness posts but now it's my friend posting them, but also complaining about how she doesn't like when people call her belly ""big"" because she worked so hard to get back into shape pre-pregnancy. I had to unfollow her fitness account and muted her regular account. I didn't tell her outright but I mentioned that I was still going through a lot and it was tough to talk about her pregnancy so she has cooled it a little since then, at least to me, which I do respect.

That being said, I know how painful it is to hear about other's ""easy"" pregnancy stories or feeling like they are taking TTC for granted. You are not wrong for feeling that way and have every right to not want to talk about your friend's issues with her. If you feel like it, you can just let her know that you understand how stressful TTC can be but you're not quite ready to discuss yet, or even if you have been talking about it with her just tell her something like ""I know you're stressed about it and I would love to talk about it some other time but I'm feeling a little rough today so can we change the topic?"" Hopefully she will respect your request.

It's my first time on this thread, recommended by a friend who found a lot of support here and basically came to vent about a similar situation so thank you for ensuring this long post. I'm also a nurse in a burn center and have had so many peds patients with the same birthday or name as my angel baby would have so it has been super rough lately. Sending my love and best wishes ‚ù§‚ù§‚ù§

The referral process was only an issue due to logistics. My OB told me she was referring me for an HSG and something else and to call to schedule my appointment the following day. When I called they said they had not received my referral, that happened 2 more times before they got the referral except said it wasn't for the HSG.

Additionally, you're supposed to have the HSG between CD5 and CD12 (I think) and the day I was calling in was ~CD8 (+ no referral yet) so I had to wait a full month before getting in. 

Obviously, this was bad luck and maybe a little bit of bad service. But I remember at one point thinking I have good insurance, why are you making it so hard for me to be seen? I know it's a horrible/privledged thing to think, but this process does not always bring out my best self. 

Another thing that someone on here said to me was, we have to advocate for ourselves in this process. IMO, there is such a lack of shits given in regards to diagnostic care.

This makes me so sad because I do it too, although I've gotten better about it lately.

For me, it helps to know that the baby doesn't have a blood connection to you until the placenta forms (around 6 weeks), so go ahead and enjoy that sushi! What I usually do is if I pass on sushi during the TWW, I treat myself with it when my period starts. I also drink til the line turns pink too haha - I figure I got pregnant once before while drinking and eating crap, so why wouldn't it happen again, as long as I'm overall healthy.

I canceled my gym membership and my hubby added ""spouse"" to his, so now we pay only one cheap price and I can go with him whenever I feel like it.

Trips / vacations - this one stresses me out because I always think ""what if I'm pregnant - can I fly, can I do this and that"" and I've come to the realization that if I'm pregnant it's gonna trump everything anyway. So if I have a vaca planned and I get pregnant and I'm not comfy with going / doing things, then fuck it, I'd rather lose out on the $$ (a friend of mine did this when his wife got pregnant - they had Europe trip planned and had to cancel non-refundable tickets. He says they have zero regrets, and just went to France a few months ago).

I drink herbal tea instead of coffee, and allow myself coffee on my period (I prefer tea in general though so this wasn't only for pregnancy).

Ditto on the job thing - I keep thinking if I get preggo, they'd pay my maternity leave and I wouldn't have to worry about job security.

I also sometimes daydream about how and when I'd announce to family and friends.

I think this entire process is a normal part of the frustration of ttc, especially after a loss, because you already thought of these things and then suddenly stopped having to. Just try not to plan your life around the ""what if I am"" and just embrace the ""what I am right now."" I had sushi yesterday, and my fertile window just ended (but I still limit my fish intake and I usually keep it to baked salmon and what not, since that's good for you and ttc). A lot of women don't even know they're pregnant for a while, so chances are they smoke, drink, eat sushi, etc., everything they shouldn't until they find out. Not to say that you should do these things or that they're safe and healthy, but we can't put our lives on hold hoping for that positive and then another month goes by and you get your period and you think ""damn, should've gone to Hawaii.""

<p>I have PCOS with no history of ruptured cysts outside of pregnancy.  All RPL tests come back normal.  RE isn&#39;t sure how the cysts are related to the losses, if at all, but I&#39;ll have an appointment this week to discuss.  Next steps I guess are an HSG and maybe genetic testing on my husband. </p>

<p>I can&#39;t find anything online about other people having this problem, and I&#39;m just at a loss.  I keep finding stories of &quot;my aunt has 11 CPs, then her 12th was successful!&quot;, and I just don&#39;t know if I can do that.  It&#39;s so hard each time to spend two weeks happy and hopeful, just to lose it.</p>

After the first MC, my husband said he wasn‚Äôt ready to try again. I was devastated. I wanted to TTC ASAP, which was a combination of hormones and my inner urge to correct what went wrong (even though I obv had no control over the MC). I started crying and said I have this urge in me that I cannot deny. He tried to understand and acknowledge that I have this intense drive to have a baby. He said ok and that he was onboard again. We accepted the fact that we were just the 1 in 4.

The first 3-4 months afterwards, my cycles were so screwed up and nothing happened of course. We started trying in earnest once cycles normalized for another 4 straight months. By this point, my husband was like why aren‚Äôt we getting pregnant again? I could tell he was starting to get more into it...asking when we could test, when the FW was, etc. Then he started ‚Äúknocking on wood‚Äù hoping I was pregnant. It was cute, but I was getting anxious. 

We ended up getting pregnant that 4th cycle of very seriously trying, only to find out that it was another MC. This was a breaking point for the both of us. I couldn‚Äôt stop crying, and he would get so frustrated seeing me so upset all the time and not working, letting the house become a mess, etc. He finally said ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt want to see you go thru this again. Maybe it‚Äôs not meant to be that we have kids? Maybe we should look into adoption?‚Äù It really triggered me, because we haven‚Äôt done testing or anything and until someone tells me I cannot have kids physically, then I will keep trying no matter what. It was super emotional at the time, but I didn‚Äôt get into it with him and just let him sleep on it. I tried to get back into my normal routine and move on, even though I‚Äôm still actively bleeding and in the perpetual waiting part. He ended up turning around and started bringing it up on his own- talks of future kids and hoping I‚Äôm pregnant again soon. I‚Äôm not really sure what happened, besides me not crying in front of him and trying to be normal - but I‚Äôll take it. He has told me he just wants to look forward.

I found a few things that led me to <a href=""https://haveababy.com/fertility-information/ivf-authority/failed-ivf-chemical-pregnancy-and-miscarriage"">this article.</a>  Despite the terrible website name of ‚Äúhaveababy.com‚Äù, it is actually a fertility clinic‚Äôs website. It basically says that while early loss is pretty common, recurrent early loss is not, and that it suggests implantation dysfunction. 
I was all set to show my doctor at my WTF appointment, but then suggested the hysteroscopy, so luckily we were on the same page. </p>

We are going to meet with an RE to be monitored more closely because my progesterone and hcg weren‚Äôt tested or tracked in my last two pregnancies. I‚Äôm honestly not sure what I am supposed to be doing now. We didn‚Äôt plan on having another child, but after the surprise pregnancy and loss, we decided we did want one. I am so afraid of being told that it‚Äôs just my age, but that they can‚Äôt tell me what about my age is the problem. Not really a question, just frustration.</p>
