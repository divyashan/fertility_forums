<p>Sunday was All Saints Sunday, and our church does a small remembrance ceremony for people who have died in the congregation in the past year. They finished reading the list of names and dates, and my friend reached over and gave me a squeeze on the knee, and just acknowledged our baby privately. It was such a small gesture, but it meant so much to me for someone to still recognize our baby as a life lost this year.

Really all I need with FF is the place to put my data, chart, and crosshairs. I am only interested in putting more money to my fertility if it will actually HELP. When we failed another cycle recently I sat between using more advanced OPKs and Pre-seed. I went with pre-seed because I figured it is more likely to help than an advanced OPK. Yeah it may tell me more accurately my fertile days, but I‚Äôm already having sex EOD when my period stops and as I reach my window we got everyday if we can, on O, after O...we are having sex...the advanced OPK isn‚Äôt going to change that. </p>

Yet there they were, only this time, there was a heartbeat, and we were asked whether we wanted to wait for them to die inside me or have them removed. Then I woke up.</p>

<p>Nothing&#39;s really relaxing anymore, if even sleep offers only bad dreams and tension in my neck upon waking. I&#39;m really struggling.</p>

*The Wonder Weeks* goes a bit deeper into the development - I was skeptical at first, but I have a 12 week old here right now that's so far proving it right. It can easily be read when the baby's there, one chapter at a time.

It really helped make the day a little less unbearable. I feel relieved that I passed the one year milestone of my son‚Äôs death, but I know it could have left me feeling much worse.

The past two days I have pretty much just hung around the house. Crying, letting myself eat whatever the hell I want, being lazy, sleeping extra. No going to work, not even remotely thinking about it. No gym. Nothing but my husband and my son. That‚Äôs it!

Pretty much being vegetative helped me a lot. I feel like I can take on a little bit more today. I went to the cemetery with my husband yesterday.

Honestly, it‚Äôs like I‚Äôve been a living shell of myself, and I‚Äôm starting to finally emerge from that dark place. I was surprised that he felt the same way, because he never vocalized it before, but he does. We held each other and cried. He still promised we would ‚Äúhave another baby,‚Äù he‚Äôs so eager to ‚Äúfix things,‚Äù but I know he just badly wants to have a living family with me, because I feel the same, and he still loves and misses Riyad. I told him that I am honestly not worried about our fertility, I just really miss our son. That‚Äôs what I was focusing on. We talked about the day I gave birth to him last year. He still has the photo he took of me the day before Riyad died‚Äîwe had assembled his stroller, and I stood next to it, super pregnant, with a huge smile on my face. He looks at it all the time. 

We spent the rest of the day watching Netflix and cuddling. My sisters went to the cemetery to visit Riyad. I was going to go with them, but I felt drained from my visit with my husband, so I thought it was better that I continue to think about him at home. They sent me photos. My friend Farah sent me tons of baby loss poems personalized with Riyads name and date of birth/death. 

Farah has an idea for her son‚Äôs second anniversary (in December). She is going to lasercut her son‚Äôs face on a dog tag necklace, and keep it with her wherever  she goes. I think it‚Äôs a really nice idea and I am going to do something similar. We talked for awhile yesterday about how she addresses her kids to people (sometimes she says she has three, sometimes only two, sometimes she feels guilty but other times she doesn‚Äôt want strangers to know her family‚Äôs story)...and how scary a new pregnancy is going to be for me. 

My SIL (the pregnant one) texted me to tell me she‚Äôs thinking of me and baby Riyad and will never forget him. This surprised the hell out of me because I thought she was very annoying with her constant pregnancy talk. But we were good friends before my son died, and it was very sweet of her to remember without me having to remind her. More people let me know they are thinking of us and sent their love...people who have been super nice and caring this whole year. 

This sub has really helped me a lot. I feel less alone, I feel like there‚Äôs SO many people on here who understand and are super empathetic. So thank you all again. The first anniversary was not as bad as I expected at all.

<p>Our therapist has been excellent and has worked with plenty of military families before so navigating some of the logistics Post-loss (like how to deal with the VA, or whatever) has been helpful with her because when have run into obstacles she has been able to say, ‚Äúlet me know if this is still a problem in a week, and I can put you in touch with someone who has been through it before.‚Äù So knowing that there are other military families in the area who have navigated this before us has helped us to feel less alone too, on top of all the emotional crap. If your region is a densely populated military region, you might also benefit from resources like that one. </p>

<p>I‚Äôm so sorry you‚Äôre going through this, and going through it without your husband by your side is an extra layer of cruelty and challenge that no one should have to deal with. I wish I could sit with you IRL and hug you and give you wine and chocolate. </p>

However, I did break up with a friend who was insensitive about our infertility journey. Around 10 mos of TTC and beginning to start fertility testing I was going through a really tough time mentally. I was extremely depressed and cried all the time. This friend, who I was the maid of honor for, was privy to all my sadness. She was my confidante throughout the depression. We met up shortly before Christmas to go bowling and talked about what I was feeling. I told her the weekend before, I stayed in bed until 4pm and felt so broken. Come New Years Eve, we're at a mutual friend's party. Midnight strikes and her and her husband come over to us and say ""we've got an announcement... We're going to be parents!!!"" I about slapped her. I was shocked at her rudeness. I said ""uhm....... cool. How far along are you?"" She says 11 weeks. I was like ""wow. Congrats I guess.""

However, I did break up with a friend who was insensitive about our infertility journey. Around 10 mos of TTC and beginning to start fertility testing I was going through a really tough time mentally. I was extremely depressed and cried all the time. This friend, who I was the maid of honor for, was privy to all my sadness. She was my confidante throughout the depression. We met up shortly before Christmas to go bowling and talked about what I was feeling. I told her the weekend before, I stayed in bed until 4pm and felt so broken. Come New Years Eve, we&#39;re at a mutual friend&#39;s party. Midnight strikes and her and her husband come over to us and say &quot;we&#39;ve got an announcement... We&#39;re going to be parents!!!&quot; I about slapped her. I was shocked at her rudeness. I said &quot;uhm....... cool. How far along are you?&quot; She says 11 weeks. I was like &quot;wow.

Trying after 1 is hard. Trying after multiple losses is even harder (in my personal opinion). But right now you need to take time to heal and grieve and like you said, you can make a decision later.

Everyone has been really compassionate and no one has said anything insensitive to me. However....

(TW living child) Today I overheard an older female coworker, who loved to get all up in my pregnancy business when I was pregnant with my first, talking to two male co-workers whose wives are both pregnant. One of them is due at the exact same time my son was due, with their first child, and the other is due next month with their second. The older female coworker was yapping about how "" if you think you're busy when you have one child, just wait till the second one comes!""

I've been pretty good most of this week at work, and have even had nice chats with the guy whose wife is as far along as I should be right now. But something about joking/griping about how crazy it is to have two kids just makes me upset and sad.

<p>(TW living child) Today I overheard an older female coworker, who loved to get all up in my pregnancy business when I was pregnant with my first, talking to two male co-workers whose wives are both pregnant. One of them is due at the exact same time my son was due, with their first child, and the other is due next month with their second.

<p>I&#39;ve been pretty good most of this week at work, and have even had nice chats with the guy whose wife is as far along as I should be right now. But something about joking/griping about how crazy it is to have two kids just makes me upset and sad. </p>

This is my first posting and I'm not sure if it's in the right place.

To cut a long story abysmally short, I have had five miscarriages and a stillbirth over the past three and a half years owing to a case of antiphospholipid syndrome that was discovered well into the fourth pregnancy and has not responded to conventional or unconventional treatment.  Lovenox, plaquenil, aspirin - they only seem to prolong the inevitable deaths.  

I'm twenty-one weeks into my sixth pregnancy and working with a rheumatologist, a batch of MFMs, a cardiologist, a fetal cardiologist, etc, etc.  Everything was gravy, lol, during this pregnancy until the sixteenth week when my scan revealed IUGR already, an echogenic bowel, a heart defect, and a compromised connection between the fetus and the umbilical artery. This happened during my last stillbirth. 

And now I'm just waiting for it to end, I guess, but at the same time, doing all the things pregnant women are supposed to do. Taking my vitamins. Sleeping a million hours a night. Avoiding alcohol. Suffering heartburn. Throwing up all the time. And just waiting for the baby to die so that I can go into the hospital and pull together the copay and spend three days there laboring and all and I am dreading it super hard.  

The hardest parts of this particular moment:

- Hiding my pregnancy from coworkers and friends because I can't bear to talk about it.

- Avoiding cigarettes. I am stressed and hopeless feeling all the time, and cigarettes are very tempting for me and it is damn near impossible to decline them when even the doctors are sure that the baby's going to die shortly.  To be perfectly honest, this is one of my biggest sources of conflict. Please no lectures. Please. 

- My husband desperately wanted to tell his family and I held him off for twenty weeks, but he finally insisted that we break the proverbial silence and now they all know this about me.  They know that I'm pregnant, that I have APS, that I've had a series of losses, and that my case has been unresponsive to medicine.  His family is super fertile and he has a bunch of sisters and cousins that are all sooooo nice and they all have a bunch of babies and I spend holidays with them and it is very hard for me. And now they all know that I'm different from them. I feel very conspicuous about it.

- My own biological family live far away, and they only ""care"" about my Ongoing Problem insofar as they are drama-curious voyeurs who want the latest update. I resent this and keep them at a firm distance. They barely know anything because they are vampires.

- I feel profoundly alone. Particularly because I'm sure there's no lol ""rainbow baby"" in the cards for me. My APS is too severe and my MFM told me that any pregnancy I have will be compromised by IUGR and necessarily premature.

- I don't think I can go through all this shit again.

- I feel bad for my husband because he would be an amazing and loving father. I feel like I'm robbing him of a meaningful experience. He made me promise not to leave him for his sake because he knows I think he should find someone who can give him the family he wants. This makes me want to kill myself.

I got pregnant with my second while I was still nursing my first and it was definitely impacting my luteal phases‚Äî the longest I had before conceiving him was 9 days. The month we pulled the goalie, BOOM, BFP 10dpo. So yeah, people can get pregnant with short luteal phases but my hunch was that in that case, the embryo just happened to implant very early (I had some spotting around 6-7 dpo and always assumed that was just an implantation bleed) so the embryo stimulated the corpus luteum early enough that it didn‚Äôt have time to stop functioning before receiving signals to support a pregnancy, rather than shed a lining. I think this was just a fortuitous circumstance‚Äî an unlikely early implantation that happened to work out. 

After that baby was stillborn, my luteal phases were ABSURDLY short‚Äî like less than a week long. Ovulation was normal, I knew something was likely wrong with my progesterone levels. This is super normal after a full term delivery, apparently, but for them to be THAT short seemed odd even to my RE. If they had been ten days, I wouldn‚Äôt have even worried about it because historically, that‚Äôs when I get my BFPs. (Disclaimer: I know that every pregnancy is different‚Äî that‚Äôs just been my experience across four of my five pregnancies.) 

So my RE and I agreed to trigger with Ovidrel and then supplement with progesterone. I declined Clomid because I was freaked out about the prospect of multiples. Our egg and sperm don‚Äôt have trouble joining, I just have trouble hanging onto the babies/bringing them home alive, so I didn‚Äôt want to just produce MORE eggs to fertilize and then have an even more anxious multiple pregnancy, but as I understand it, that would have been a pretty traditional course of action‚Äî stimulate ovaries, trigger ovulation, supplement with progesterone. 

It was, in our case, successful. I was monitored for follicular growth, triggered ovulation with Ovidrel once my follicle got to a certain size, and started supplementing with progesterone the day after they estimated I would ovulate. (Ovidrel produces an ovulation within 48 hours.) We timed intercourse the night I triggered and the two days following, and then I got a BFP 10dpo confirmed by bloodwork at 15dpo. (Ovidrel contains HCG so I used wondfos to trace the HCG out of my system to be sure my positive was a true positive.)

Only you know what is the best choice for you. If you want to dive right into IVF and not spend more months doing things you aren‚Äôt confident will work, then I don‚Äôt think that‚Äôs a bad choice. However, if it were me, for cost considerations, I‚Äôd consider trying this plan for at least one cycle before choosing IVF. It still offered a lot of control and visibility over the cycle, having the progesterone supplements made me feel a little less anxious about wondering when my luteal phase would end, and while it just isn‚Äôt the same level of control and visibility as IVF would be, it felt like a really good approach for us based solely on what we knew was wrong.

It&#39;s still there, but it&#39;s definitely changed and it&#39;s easier without a doubt. Hang in there, iaco. <em>hugs</em></p>

Has anyone else had bladder issues after a vaginal delivery? I feel like this is the kind of thing I would be asking other moms of nine month olds, but since I don't actually have a nine month old...

I've had a bad cough (finally diagnosed as pneumonia - so it's being treated and I feel much better) for weeks now. Sometimes when I cough I have a teeny tiny accident. Sometimes I remember to wear panty liners, sometimes I don't. Last night I didn't, and I had a legitimate accident, like, big spot on my pants accident. A crying in the restaurant bathroom accident. 

At my six week appointment my midwife said my muscles were in great shape, and I did so many kegels during pregnancy I feel like I should be in the clear. 

I guess my question is, should I go see a doctor about this (I don't live in the same town where I delivered my daughter) or is this just my life now?

I used to be active here, so I'm not sure you'll ""recognize"" me - but, I am in a position to help with your questions with a history of recurrent loss (2MMCs, 1CP) and now being on my second day of stimming during my second IVF attempt. This might will long, too, since I want to respond to a number of points and questions that you raise.

First, how my situation may be different is that my losses were a whole lot more spread apart than yours, so we were already having trouble with conceiving as it was. Also, I don't know your age, but I just turned 36 - and we started to TTC when I was 32, so this has been a long and shitty ride for us. I will say, I do not think you should start IVF until you are really sure it is the right step, because it takes a profound physical, emotional, and financial toll on you and your partner. We were able to move to IVF when we felt it was right, and it has still been very hard. My first cycle yielded zero PGS normal embryos, and that took an emotional toll as large or larger than any of my losses.

Next - up to date references. A book from 1997 is absolutely outdated. I suggest reading [Not Broken: An Approachable Guide to Miscarriage and Recurrent Pregnancy Loss](https://www.amazon.com/Not-Broken-Approachable-Miscarriage-Recurrent/dp/0998714607) by Dr. Lora Shahine. It is grounded in more current research and I happen to agree with her skepticism of quasi-scientific approaches to ""treating"" recurrent loss that she has. Those of use who have had multiple losses are a vulnerable population - we become increasingly desperate to try anything that may prevent loss, even when there is little or no strong scientific evidence to support these treatments. Just be a savvy consumer.

About your doctor pushing IVF - two things to keep in mind. One, it may well be too soon for you to go this route which is why you feel like it's a push and it makes you uncomfortable. Two, IVF with PGS is literally the only thing any RE can offer you that has any chance of reducing your odds of another loss - but importantly, does not eliminate the chance another loss will happen. Why is that? Because right now we don't actually know why your losses are happening. The odds are great that they are due to genetic abnormality of the embryos, but we don't know that, so we can't rule out that it's because of implantation or lining issues. The benefit of an IVF with PGS cycle is that if it does fail, you can start to figure out why that might be with things like biopsying the endometrial lining. 

About the insurance - that's great, I have a plan that also covers 4 rounds of ART (which, for the record, is amazing coverage for being in the US). However, it is still expensive, and unless you are in one specific health plan in Boston, PGS is not covered, and it is expensive. Also, many, if not most plans require 6 rounds of ""lesser before greater."" You can call your plan to find out the details, but it means they require you to do 6 rounds of oral meds or IUI before they will authorize you for IVF. Our plan the oral meds counted, but some plans require 6 rounds of IUI before you can do IVF. Also, insurance will only cover one round at a time (assuming that's how your coverage works, and it's not a set lifetime dollar cap, which is a whole different story) - so you cannot take advantage of shared risk plans or do banking cycles (to have embryos in the freezer). If you think IVF might be in your future, find out more about what is required for your insurance. You might want to start trying to do some ""lesser"" interventions to speed your time to conception and move in that direction. Infertility treatment should be a very stepwise process, unless you were dealing with a reason to skip straight to IVF.

About the effects on your body - Is the egg retrieval painful? That's not quite the right question. You will be under general anesthesia for your retrieval. It's the before and after where there is discomfort and pain. It depends on your response, but the bloating can be really tough. By the end, anything with a waistband is out of the question, and at least in my case, it's tough to find an injection spot that is not bruised and sore - but you just learn to deal with it. What surprised me with the first retrieval was how much pain I had after, and I did not have OHSS. The pain was really tough after the retrieval, and I had a lot of nausea (only thing I remember from the ride home was puking in a bag in a parking lot). And I really could not function until about 5 days after. Also, the embryo ""hunger games"" are brutal. All you can do is wait for these update calls and wait for the news from the PGS lab. It's one of those things that is hard to explain until you are in it, but know that it is hard.

All that said, I get the feeling that now is not the right time for you to jump to IVF. But it is a good time to learn more about what it might mean to move in that direction, in case the time comes that you want to. Feel free to message me if you have other questions.

",[],,t1_dpaddw1,False,0,[],False,"<div class=""md""><p>Hey there. I used to be active here, so I&#39;m not sure you&#39;ll &quot;recognize&quot; me - but, I am in a position to help with your questions with a history of recurrent loss (2MMCs, 1CP) and now being on my second day of stimming during my second IVF attempt. This might will long, too, since I want to respond to a number of points and questions that you raise.</p>

<p>First, how my situation may be different is that my losses were a whole lot more spread apart than yours, so we were already having trouble with conceiving as it was. Also, I don&#39;t know your age, but I just turned 36 - and we started to TTC when I was 32, so this has been a long and shitty ride for us. I will say, I do not think you should start IVF until you are really sure it is the right step, because it takes a profound physical, emotional, and financial toll on you and your partner. We were able to move to IVF when we felt it was right, and it has still been very hard. My first cycle yielded zero PGS normal embryos, and that took an emotional toll as large or larger than any of my losses.</p>

Your story sounds almost identical to mine, you can read in my history the post I made in July with more details. Basically I bled on and off since week 11, every time we had an ultrasound the baby was healthy and kicking. Unfortunately around week 15/16 my water broke, and I received the same prognosis as you.... basically there's no way the baby could develop lungs without fluid. We made the choice to give birth to our daughter Stella Rose. 

We did the full microarray genetic testing on my placenta as they thought maybe there was a genetic reason.... microarray came back 100% normal - the baby was perfect. That was a confusing result to receive, we were happy there wasn't any abnormalities, but sad/confused as to what happened.

They also did a sonohysterography (detailed scan of uterus) to see if there were any fibroids or polyps that maybe caused the bleeding,... nope. Uterus looked perfect. We were given the green light to start trying after that. Ultimately they can't say for sure what happened, but there's a good chance that the bleeding probably allowed an infection in (blood is full of bacteria they told me) - and an infection can cause the membranes to rupture. This isn't definitive, but their best guess. 

TW: current pregnancy 

I am currently about 5w pregnant - 3 cycles after losing Stella. I'm terrified every day - but the MFM specialists are going to see me my entire pregnancy and give extra monitoring beginning at 16w to measure the length of my cervix (in case that was the problem), if it's looking incompetent, I will get a cerclage.

The MFM Dr says he doesn't see why this or future pregnancies would have the same problem - basically I was extremely unlucky and it was a fluke. I sure hope he is right.

Anyways - take care of yourself, I spent the next months eating better and exercising trying to make sure I was doing everything in my power to create a healthy safe space for my next baby. Those weeks were the worst of my life - always will be. I wouldn't wish it on my worst enemy (having to choose to end the pregnancy even though the baby was still alive)... 

I wish I had more to offer you, I truly feel your pain. It's true they say time does heal some wounds, or at least makes them more manageable. I would just say to do whatever tests they are offering, but be prepared for the result to be inconclusive. You'll know when you are ready to try again, and your body will know when it's ready to make another one as well. Lots of love your way, sending an Internet hug.

In 2015 my wife and I lost our baby boy, Walker, at 19 weeks. She went into sudden preterm labor and her water ruptured prematurely while we were out eating lunch at a restaurant. The doctors believed that the cause was simply that the cervix had opened too early, unable to support the weight of the growing pregnancy, which precipitated the preterm labor and the water rupturing.

Our son still had a strong heartbeat and was kicking away and the doctors gave us the same prognosis, namely that without amniotic fluid our son would slowly fail to develop and would likely pass away or would fall victim to infection. She was already in labor, but my wife and I opted to speed things along. Our son was born alive and kicking but passed in his mom's arms immediately after birth.

We never definitively determined a cause, our son was genetically normal and healthy, but like I said the doctors believed it to be incompetent cervix. 

**TW: Subsequent Pregnancy** Since you asked about future pregnancy after a PPROM: My wife conceived again a year after the delivery of our son and she was able to safely carry to term and deliver a healthy boy. Because of the likelihood that incompetent cervix caused the death of our first son, a cerclage was performed at 14 weeks and removed at 37 weeks and she was on progesterone suppositories from 15 weeks until 37 weeks.

For mine, I was told not to have anything to eat/ drink starting at midnight the night before. Got the the hospital the next morning and checked in at the surgery admission desk in the women‚Äôs health department where they updated my information and emergency contact information. Took the papers they gave me up to the day surgery ward‚Äôs front desk. They started a chart for me and got me into a bed and I changed into just a gown. Filled out a bunch of paperwork about my medical history, any allergies, and any medication/ supplement/ vitamin that I had taken in the last X amount of time.  They collected blood work as well. 

Hubby and I waited around there for an hour or two (I didn‚Äôt have a pre-determined OR time- I was just on call for whenever they could fit me in) and when it was time to go they wheeled me in the bed into the pre-OR area. There I met the OB-GYN doing the surgery, the anesthesiologist (who reviewed my medical sheet with me and put an IV in) and one of the nurses that would be in there (she told me she had pregnancy losses and needed a D&C herself. She also has three kids afterwards) everyone was super nice and supportive while I sobbed my way through the saga that is my uterus. After they had all the info they needed they wheeled me into the OR theatre. It‚Äôs a big-ish room with a bed in the middle and stainless steel cabinets/ storage supplies. Massive light thing hanging from the roof. They lined up my bed with the OR table and I scotched myself over and into place per their instructions. They started pushing some fluid through my IV and held an oxygen mask to my face and told me to take deep breaths and then I blacked out pretty quick.  

I woke up in the recovery room of the OR groggy, less than 2h later (surgery was suppose to take about 20 min but then anaesthetic knocks you out a lot longer). My brain felt foggy and I felt sore all over- kind of stuff like when you have to sleep on a crappy bed. They asked me if I had any pain/ cramping and I did have a little bit, so they gave me some painkillers for that. (The cramps weren‚Äôt sore enough to warrant good pain killers, but I was still groggy and didn‚Äôt want the pain to get worse once the good drugs were no longer an option). Once I was fully conscious they took me back to my day surgery ‚Äòroom‚Äô and had notified hubby to meet me back there so he was there when I got in. They checked me for how much I was bleeding and took my vitals every hour post op (I was only there for 2h after I woke up in the recovery room). They made me go to the bathroom before I was allowed to be discharged. Gave me a jumbo pad and disposable underwear to change into and then we went home. 

Anesthetic turns my stomach (and most people‚Äôs) so I had planned to mostly eat chicken noodle soup (for the love of god no dairy until you feel better), but I was hungry enough after soup to eat more substantially. We just sat around and watched Netflix for the rest of the day. My nether-regions felt... odd but never in pain, I didn‚Äôt even take Tylenol. Mild cramping and light spotting was the worst of it. The next day I still felt gross from the anaesthetic so that was another Netflix day. After that, I was physically completely fine. Took a full week off work for the mental recovery though which was a really good decision for me (I work in a hospital lab so everyone who goes to the ER for pregnancy issues ends up getting blood work done, so all day every day I‚Äôm exposed to this stuff to some degree) 

...jeeze that turned into a novel! But I really wanted to know what to expect before mine, so hopefully this info makes it at least slightly less scary for you.  My only negative thoughts about it are that I wish I had gotten it sooner. 

Edit to add on: my hCG was negative by early September but my ultrasound in late September to figure out why I was still bleeding showed that the tissue hadn‚Äôt changed at all from my scans in July when the MC first started.

Yes. I intentionally broke up with 2 friends after my losses. I just let it fade. Both are just not sensitive at all about my stillbirths - and have disappointed me on numerous occasions with their callousness. They have other undesirable qualities as well, and I just generally get little value from the relationships. I used to put up with relationships like that, but now I have a higher bar. Fewer friends, but better people. I didn't TELL them it was over, just stopped returning calls and texts (or was super slow at doing so). Maybe that's ghosting instead of fading? lol  

In your case, though, it doesn't sound like she's done a whole lot of terribleness, just didn't email you? The absence hurts, but could she have just gotten busy? Lost the email? Is dealing with her own stuff? Not an excuse, but I would personally also not cut someone out for failing to email. I'd maybe trust them less or be a little distant, but not totally cut them out.

After my second miscarriage my regular OB ran the thrombophilia panel and it was found that I have lupus anticoagulant and hetero for MTHFR gene mutation, BUT aside from the testing my OB put it in the hands of a specialist. He referred me to a highly respected fertility doctor that is over an hour drive from us, but it has given me a lot of hope, even after having this third loss under his care. 

My first appointment with the fertility specialist they reviewed by chart sent over from my OB as well as all the test results. I also had a vaginal ultrasound done by the PA with the Dr. reviewing in his office. We then met with the Dr. who basically drafted out a plan. He reviewed the scan and showed us my uterus size (joked that there was plenty of room for multiples) and his plan of my next pregnancy. The one thing that turned me off initially was the amount of tests he did want to run like checking my tubes for blockages xrays and such and it irritated me because we never had issues with conceiving (3 for 3 the first month) but its sustaining the pregnancy is my problem. 

There are perks to seeing a fertility specialist as you will be much more closely monitored during subsequent pregnancies, but it can be pricey depending on your coverage. AND its best if you're willing to play by their rules. They are a fertility center and theyre in the business of making babies. I was hardheaded in the beginning and insisted on getting pregnant on our own, which we did, but proved to be somewhat difficult with dating and monitoring. But I think moving forward we will go ahead to do things ""their way"". That way they know exactly when I ovulate, conceive and implant...kinda creepy but makes their job easier especially my treatment plan is dependent on a positive test.

She is incredibly optimistic and seems to think positive pregnancy test = baby in 9 months.  I had tried testing the waters with her a few months ago, casually bringing up that advanced maternal age is a concern, but she just waved it away as, ""No no, medicine nowadays is great.  They can do anything.""  It was simultaneously frustrating and quaint, like, ""Oh you sweet summer child."" kinda thing.  Many opportunities have come up for me to mention that I've had multiple consecutive losses in an attempt to... I don't know, just try to explain that things aren't always great.  But then I ask what's the point in even telling her.  She'll try to be supportive, but based on past experience I am not sure she will be supportive the way I would like for her to be, even if she genuinely means well.

I don't get raging mad when someone makes an announcement, but I do kind of cringe internally when I see posts about buying special books, onesies, or whatever.

They can do anything.&quot;  It was simultaneously frustrating and quaint, like, &quot;Oh you sweet summer child.&quot; kinda thing.  Many opportunities have come up for me to mention that I&#39;ve had multiple consecutive losses in an attempt to... I don&#39;t know, just try to explain that things aren&#39;t always great.

That‚Äôs one big thing to consider, though. I don‚Äôt know the exact stat, but something like 75% if recurrent loss goes unexplained. Testing may find nothing and you need to understand that going in. I sat around hoping for a thyroid issue - how ridiculous right? But I wanted a REASON. We didn‚Äôt get one. And that was hard. 

Now also, I don‚Äôt know that you need to hold off TTC for this. Yes, you could get pregnant and have another loss. But..the odds of this being bad luck and the next one working are actually good. So if you can get testing without a ttc break, that‚Äôs ok too. 

If you want to talk RLP, Im your gal. I have a list of tests I‚Äôve had done/etc 

Good luck!

What if it‚Äôs just bad luck, it‚Äôs not likely to happen again a third time, I don‚Äôt want to waste time waiting for results when I could be trying. And the. We got pregnant the third time and lost it for the third time. So I ended up having to wait longer for the miscarriage to end and then start seeing the fertility specialist than if I would have just done it after the second loss.</p>

<p>So I don‚Äôt think there is a wrong answer, but I definitely wish I had done it sooner. Good luck! ‚ù§Ô∏è</p>

I use one called P.C. (For period calendar) and one called Glow. Glow will figure out patterns over time (such as your miscarriage throwing things off from normal cycles and giving you a more accurate view of how your body might ovulate in subsequent cycles. 

If you do Ovulation strips, you can indicate when you get a positive and Glow will adjust. 

Keep in mind, your body may be different than what is ""average"" and predicted on Glow. For example, it will assume with a 28 day cycle that you will ovulate on day 14. However, it may be day 15, 16, or even later. 

I found I ovulated on day 14 or 15 when I had a natural cycle. When I was on Clomid, I ovulated on day 16 or 17 (medicated cycle). 

So, ovulation strips are helpful. You can get a bulk pack on Amazon for cheap. 

You don't need to chart your cycle like a scientist. Just indicate in one of the apps when your cycle starts, and it should provide you with a snapshot of what trends or patterns are in your cycle.

There is probably also value in my parents‚Äô optimistic ‚Äúbuck up‚Äù attitude, though most of the time that‚Äôs been the last thing I want.</p>

<p>So I guess what I‚Äôm saying is that people bring different things to the table and it might help to take stock of what you need right now and who can and can‚Äôt provide it. It‚Äôs ok to recognize that someone is not capable of giving you what you need - it doesn‚Äôt mean that you have a bad relationship, just that you should maybe focus on the people who make you feel better right now.</p>

<p>That being said, if it gives you closure to clear up the misunderstanding between you and your MIL, or if she now starts crossing boundaries by bringing up babies, you could try talking to her. Maybe next time she asks ‚Äúhow are you?‚Äù, take her at her word and be honest about how you‚Äôre struggling. Then pay close attention to her reaction and gauge if she can really provide the emotional support you need right now.</p>

<p>Sorry for the rambling. I&#39;m just nervous. And nervous to wean off my psych meds. I have severe PTSD, depression and anxiety. It&#39;s going to be a rough winter but so worth it if this pregnancy goes well. </p>

I had a similar experience after a miscarriage, I had never heard of the Rh- issue before, and it wasn't until a few days after that a friend of mine who was a midwife in training marched me down to the hospital associated with my OB and insisted that I get a blood test (I didn't know my Rh status prior).

I always find things like that reassuring, as if they‚Äôre a sign from Sam. After our happy ultrasound yesterday, my husband and I went immediately to his grave. So I‚Äôm imagining today‚Äôs little rainbow was like a wink and a hug from him. I miss him and am so sad that we couldn‚Äôt bring him home, and then all those feelings are muddled by happiness about this pregnancy. Of course I want this baby to come home safe and healthy in about 7 months, but I never wanted to be in this position. </p>

I experienced a loss 9 years ago this month. I met my husband somewhere around 5 or 6 years ago, I think. My situation is slightly different because I lost a tube when I lost the pregnancy.

My husband never made me feel broken or defective for having had a loss and missing part of my reproductive system necessary for a new pregnancy. He's been super supportive and during my chemical earlier this year didn't push me to be more excited/less scared than I was. He understood that my feelings were valid and never tried to pretend otherwise.

I do wish he would have asked more about my loss and given me a chance to talk about it instead of treating it like an uncomfortable semi-secret. I understand that he didn't know what to ask or say or what my boundaries were, but I wish he would've gently asked me to stop him if he was overstepping and asked anything he was curious about. It's all come out over time, but he didn't completely understand where I was coming from at first because he didn't ask.

Still, when we first began TTC I felt very close to my ex even though we hadn't talked much in a few years. I mean, here I was trying to recreate part of an experience that I'd only had with him. I did end up reaching out to him for a few months to talk things over and kind of remember the loss try to find a way to put it into the context of my new life. I would've been upset if my husband had interfered with this process. It was kind of an emotional time, but not at all romantic or sexual. I'm really glad I'm on good enough terms with my ex and that my husband is not jealous. Not saying your husband is in this situation with his ex at all, just giving my experience.

This sub also helped me a lot with coping with the residual grief since I never actually had counseling. I would talk to my husband about the support I was getting from other who had experienced it and he was good at listening to that.

Being told to wait can be really frustrating.  If possible, maybe devote the next six months to mourning and trying to heal (physically‚Äã and emotionally) as much as possible.  

How's the recovery going so far?

In some ways the fact that it was twins made it harder - I completely agree that it felt extra unfair to lose two. When we initially learned the first one had died I felt certain the other one would make it. I mean, surely fate wouldn't be so cruel as to take both of them.  But I comfort myself thinking that wherever they are, they're together. And that helps a bit.

And they were special. It took me months to accept them because I was planning/expecting one and was really worried about carrying/birthing/breast feeding two.  Even though I know it's incredibly unlikely, I sort of wistfully think it might happen again. But I know I'd rather it doesn't because of all the added risks. The emotions are so complicated. 

Yes, they were born in January. It was a very dark time. Sometimes I'll read something here (like your post) and it shows me how much better I'm doing now. Maybe that's encouraging? Not to say there aren't still bad days. But I no longer feel as though I'm dragging myself through every hour. I no longer feel as though I'm gritting my teeth through every interaction. I no longer get to the end of day and realize how much tension I've been holding. I used to feel like I had to put on emotional armour every day and it became habit because I never knew where or when the next unexpected pain would come from.  I don't do that anymore. I mean, there are still unexpectedly painful things, but they've become more bittersweet. It's sometimes nice to be reminded of them when I see other twins out and about. It doesn't feel like a punch in the gut that I have to look away from anymore. 

I had an especially hard time around their due date. I was pregnant again and couldn't really focus on it because I just kept thinking, ""they should be here"". When that pregnancy ended at 6 weeks I felt really angry at the unfairness. But I didn't feel heartbroken like I did (do) with the twins. That pregnancy was technically conceived before we were meant to. I don't really think that's why we lost it, but i think even if my body was ready, my heart really wasn't. 

Even though in general I think I'm doing pretty well, I'm very apprehensive as we move more towards the one year mark.  I did some journaling and lots of meditating earlier in the year. I think I might need to start that again. And I finally found a therapist I like. I see her once a month which seems like enough. It's nice to have someone to talk to about such a depressing subject that I don't have to feel guilty about burdening. 

32 is still relatively young, but I do look into the future and wonder. I always wanted a big family, 3 or 4 kids. **Trigger warning**: we have one. It took 8 months to conceive him, with a chemical pregnancy in the middle of that. At this point I think I'd be content if we manage to have two. But I hate the helpless feeling of not being able to plan our family or our timeline.

For some background, the only reason I was doing a D&C this time around was to be able to have genetic testing done on the placental tissue.

Monday night, I received a letter in the mail from my insurance company saying that they were NOT going to cover the testing - only to realize that instead of the Natera Anora Miscarriage test, they'd billing coded for Genetic Testing for Colorectal Cancer Susceptibility - to which my insurance company was like ""Ummmm. No.""

My RE's office likes to treat non-IVF patients like myself as second class citizens - no matter what your issue is, they do NOT have a phone line that allows you to speak to an actual human being. Whether it's a clinical question or a billing question, to tell them you're running late for an appointment, whatever the case may be - if you're not an IVF patient, you have to leave a message on the relevant voicemail and they will call you back at their convenience. So I left a message at 9am (as soon as it let me leave a message, even though they open at 8:30am) saying I needed to speak with someone urgently because the procedure check-in was that day at 1pm. No call back until I was already in there.

However, it turns out I don't even need to worry about the wrong test being done (worst case) or the wrong billing code being used (super fixable and common).

My RE had prescribed me a vaginal suppository of misoprostol to ""soften the cervix and reduce the pain and physical recovery time"". I was told to insert it when I woke up, and it would soften my cervix enough by the time I went in that he would have an easier time dilating the cervix to complete the D&C. It turns out, I seem to be super responsive to misoprostol because it was *too* effective.

By the time I got to the hospital at 12:30pm, I was already bleeding. I told the hospital staff this once I realized (I noticed the slight bleeding when they asked me to undress and gown up), and they did the best they could to help me feel comfortable. About 30 minutes later, the cramping and nausea were unbearable and I told the staff ""this is what it felt like when I had a natural miscarriage, this is the level of pain I had back then"" - they gave me an anti-nausea medication, some opiates for the pain, and a muscle relaxant all in my IV and told me to let them know if it felt like I was gushing blood. About an hour before my surgery was scheduled, I called the nurse back and said ""I can feel that I am gushing blood and the pain is returning"".

They kept me so out of it on opiates, I couldn't even think straight after that. All I remember is pain, cramping, and my husband holding my hand while I tried to keep my cussing to a minimum by substituting in silly replacement words (it's a Christian hospital, and despite my own athiest beliefs I was trying to be respectful and not be totally blasphemous in expressing my pain). It wasn't until almost an hour after my surgery was scheduled that I got into the operating room. The staff were all super nice and friendly and helped as much as they could. They gave me the gas and 3 2 1 out I went.

I woke up about 40 minutes later - the first thing the nurse told me is that my husband was in consulting and the doctor was telling him that there were no products of conception left to do the genetic testing on. In fact, there wasn't much for him to do except make sure my uterus was actually empty. It turned out I'd passed the pregnancy tissue in that hospital bed thanks to the miso. I still had massive cramping pains immediately after waking up and so I was given more IV pain killers and muscle relaxants until the cramping stopped.

But now I'm left with no genetic testing, no possibility for some answers unless we go through the whole thing again, and a nice hefty hospital bill to pay. However, it's the easiest and fastest physical recovery after a D&C that I've ever had. After the pain killers wore off, I was perfectly fine - no physical pain at all, no tenderness, and very minimal bleeding. Apparently there was really nothing for the doc to do other than a quick check of my uterus to be sure everything was gone. He barely had to do any manual dilation (just enough to get his tools in there) and my cervix was so stretchy from the miso that it was like stretching a rubber band.

Mostly I'm angry that we won't have any chance for answers unless we go through another failed pregnancy. I would have preferred a painful recovery and getting some answers (or ruling out some potential issues!) to an easy recovery and having to just ""try try again"".

This is my last chance at having another baby and I just want it work out SO damn badly. I keep imagining my May baby strapped to my chest in a baby carrier and getting excited. I'm so scared of being hurt again. Ugh. This process is so hard.

Yeah, it is. My wife's rearrangement is literally 1 in a billion, so it's especially weird for us when we found out. It's literally mind tricks. As far as we know, there's only *one* person in the world with a rearrangement like my wife's.

Yeah, it's weird. It was extra weird for us (and perhaps you as well), because our first miscarriage was when we were 23. I think we were likely the youngest pregnant couple in the urgent care when we went in the first time. I'm pretty sure we were also the youngest some of the doctors that handled it had ever seen -- at least planned, I guess. I dunno, it's really annoying explaining that you're 24 years old, get pregnant easily, and want to have a baby, but you keep miscarrying. I feel there's a 'sympathy gap', where people don't understand that you want your children to live, despite many people our age wanting *not* to have children.

We eventually found a doctor through our church, and we found her much easier to deal with, tbh. She's older, so she likely grew up in different times, thankfully!

> We‚Äôre considering giving it another shot and seeing what happens. Since this loss was so early and it‚Äôs our first attempt together maybe it was just bad luck? Maybe it‚Äôs wishful thinking. I want to have the keryotype now and if the next attempt fails then I believe we will look seriously into more testing. I really appreciate all your information and sharing your experience.

It can never hurt to try again :)

I found the book 'Coming to term' by Cohen to be very helpful in examining the question of 'what to do next'. It's not a scientific or medical book, it's more of the author's and his wife's own experiences. It did help us in deciding what treatments to pursue. I think RPL puts you in a very vulnerable position, ready to be taken advantage of by unscrupulous providers, with sometimes dangerous treatments. The book made my wife and I take a more cautious approach. For example, we decided to only be tested through her regular OB/GYN (she handles difficult cases, so she was able to write tests) until we knew what was going on, or had any hints of where the problem could lie. We didn't want to be offered 'miracle drugs' or anything like that, which could be dangerous.

Correct. Some couples choose to do IVF with some kind of procedure to only implant embryos with the right chromosomes. However, this only works for certain rearrangements. Also, IVF is expensive, and unnecessary, and we have moral concerns with it personally. Nevertheless, we were 'lucky' enough to get pregnant quickly. Our genetics counselor is also a family friend. Thus, she was able to give my wife and I very personal advice. She told us that since we were young and got pregnant quickly, we had chance and time on our side (her advice would have been different if we had infertility or were in our later thirties). She recommended we enjoy the time we had together now as best we could and wait until a successful pregnancy, because -- in her experience -- IVF can sometimes cause a lot of heartache as well for couples that choose to pursue it (sometimes implanted 'healthy' embryos will miscarry, it can take a few cycles before a healthy embryo is achieved, and there's a financial component as well). Obviously, you have to choose what works for you, and what you can handle, but that was our experience, and we liked the advice she gave us.

Actually, at the time we got pregnant with this one, we were trying to avoid pregnancy, in order to allow my wife to recuperate from her previous loss as well as recover emotionally from this (rather sucky) news. Obviously, we're happy about the current pregnancy, but I anticipate that we will have many more miscarriages to follow, and I'm really not sure how we're going to handle that. Well, ultimately, I guess we can't control any of this, which is both awful and reassuring.

Again, I'm sorry you're going through this. I know what it feels like, and I wouldn't wish it on anyone. But, absolutely, if the miscarriages were all chromosomal in nature, get the karyotype. It could save you a lot of heartache. I know my wife found it 'freeing' to know it was beyond her control, because before, we were both on supplement programs, diets, exercise programs, etc, that took an emotional toll after a while. It was nice to just give that all up, be reassured that nothing was 'wrong', and just live instead.

At this age you likely do not have poor quality eggs. You should ask for a karyotype, which is an examination of your chromosomal structure. Sometimes, at the time of *your* conception (a man could carry it as well, but it sounds like these pregnancies were fathered by different men), parts of a chromosome break off and trade places or flip in place. These rearrangements will increase your risk of pregnancy loss, but they will not decrease your chance of a healthy pregnancy (eventually).

This is what it was for my wife and I. We've been pregnant six times in the past year and a half. Her doctor said she was the most fertile patient she's ever seen (fat load of good that did us), given how quickly she fell pregnant each time. We started trying at 23 and our last loss was at 25. After the sixth loss, we found she had an inversion on one of her chromosomes that likely resulted in our miscarriages. There is *nothing* she could do to prevent this. Her eggs are not low quality. In fact, the very process that makes a 'high' quality egg (crossing over during meiosis) is what causes some of my wife's eggs to be bad. The fact is that if her body did not attempt to maximize the reproductive fitness of her offspring by swapping sections of chromosomes, our children would be better off. Such is the nature of reproduction of course -- seemingly blind probabilistic chance, optimized only in the long term. If anyone is to be assigned 'blame', its her parents, as the rearrangement almost certainly happened spontaneously in either her father's sperm or her mother's egg. Although, of course, this really could happen to anyone.

I tell my wife that she's more evolved than everyone else, as inversions in our chromosomes are one of the main ways in which human chromosomes differ from those of our closest relatives, the chimpanzees and bonobos.

Well regardless, after six losses, we immediately fell pregnant (again..), and this pregnancy seems alright.

I guess my point is, you could have the healthiest eggs in the world, but if you have a chromosomal rearrangement, this is likely not in your best interest. 

So, I would definitely ask for this test, and if the karyotype is abnormal, I would not spend any time trying to improve egg quality.

<p>I&#39;m really thankful for everyone&#39;s opinion on this. I was already leaning towards having it done. I feel like if I had had it done before, it wouldn&#39;t have necessarily made the loss easier, but maybe it would have given me answers that would make it easier to accept. I don&#39;t know many women personally who would have done this, as I think most of them likely would have skipped the testing and said &quot;it won&#39;t change anything so why do it.&quot; Admittedly, I felt the same way before, but I think I&#39;d rather have answers after having miscarried. </p>

I started seeing the RE after my second loss. We did all sorts of testing, including genetic carrier screening, autoimmune tests, blood clotting tests, hysteroscopy, etc. Nothing abnormal. My period had been getting lighter and shorter until it was almost absent, so my doctor wanted to check my hormones. It was a test called the ovarian assessment report (OAR), but the same info can be obtained with standard CD3 tests. My FSH is elevated and my AMH (an indicator of ovarian reserve) is very low. Based on the subsequent OAR score, my doctor explained that i am running low on eggs and if I wanted more than one kid I should strongly consider freezing embryos for later and then resume trying for #1 the old fashioned way. We decided to go for it, and did a round of IVF for fertility preservation last August. Although 17 eggs were retrieved, only 10 fertilized normally, and only 4 of those made it to day 6. Of those, 2 had chromosomes incompatible with life. The two normal embryos are in the freezer for later since when we try again I'll be 36 and it's not like my eggs are getting fresher.

After the IVF we went back to trying on our own, but I was being monitored because my lining was super shitty. I was given a few options for things to help it and ended up taking an assortment of supplements, doing acupuncture, and since my LP was shortening, I started taking progesterone after ovulation. If my lining continued to diminish I was going to start on estrogen, but thankfully didn't need to. Given my age and my old eggs, we gave it until February to get pregnant. If I wasn't knocked up by then, or if I had another loss, we were going to do IVF a second time and start doing transfers. Luck was on our side and I got pregnant in January, and have a darling little 2 week old sitting on my chest right now. I can't say it was anything that I did, but I think luck was just on our side the 4th time. I am glad I had all the tests done though, especially because we know we have 2 chromosomally normal embryos to transfer when we are ready to try for a second. I suspect that we will need to use them, and knowing they somewhat are less likely to result in a miscarriage is awesome.

I would strongly encourage temping, because that will help you troubleshoot, and even better if you do it while DH is deployed, because that will help you have a baseline of what‚Äôs going on in your cycles when a potential pregnancy isn‚Äôt even a variable. We first started to TTC after a deployment and my one regret from that time is that I spent his deployment on the pill for my own convenience and would have been better off getting a baseline of what was normal for my cycles when I wasn‚Äôt also constantly trying to get pregnant. 

As far as how long you‚Äôve been trying to conceive; even with barriers such as deployment in the way, I don‚Äôt think it would be insane if you wanted to seek out an RE‚Äôs opinion at this point.

I‚Äôm assuming you are a Tricare beneficiary. If you are Standard, you can self refer to an RE. You can just call and make an appointment if you like. Tricare covers reproductive services at the normal rate (like, whatever your normal copay percentage is, I don‚Äôt even remember) with the exception of IUI and IVF. So bloodwork, medications, ultrasounds, etc‚Äî that will all be covered. I just got a $4000 bill from my RE and was responsible for $42, if that gives you some peace of mind. 

Depending on your region, your local MTF probably has an RE on staff too, so if you are a Prime recipient, you can look into getting an appointment there but I assume you‚Äôd need your PCM to refer you. They actually will perform IVF and IUI services at the MTF for a much lower cost than a civilian provider would, but all other services, as I understand it, are covered 100%.

My personal recommendation is to see a civilian provider, if possible. You are likely to get an appointment sooner, and it‚Äôs pretty affordable as long as you can defer to low tech options. If you aren‚Äôt a Standard recipient now, you might consider switching to give yourself more options. 

And lastly, I don‚Äôt know where you are located but if you happen to be in the DC area, check out Shady Grove‚Äî they have locations everywhere and have been really helpful for me. If you have any other questions about navigating this, especially as a military dependent, PLEASE PM me. I am by no means an expert but have been through this process in two different states now, and neither time did I try for anything close to a year before seeking help, and that wasn‚Äôt an issue either time because of the precipitating losses that led me there. I expect you would encounter more or less the same environment as I did.

<p>I know I‚Äôm obsessing. The spotting has been driving me nuts and that started when I had two ovarian cysts burst (this started after my MC). They bursted in two separate cycles. </p>

<p>This all something I was to bring up to my doctor. We are going on a year and half with only one MC to show for it. I know there some technical things in those 18 months so it may only be more like 6-8 months but we are active duty and it‚Äôs hard to have that time to try so if there is an issue that‚Äôs easily fixable with supplements, I want to know. I especially don‚Äôt want to find out after another MC. </p>

As for progesterone...honesty it sounds like you're reaching a bit. And I understand that -- always looking for an answer.

First, 12 days is not considered a short LP...and it doesn't sound like you're tracking your ovulation in a way that can truly confirm your LP length anyway. Is that correct? You'd need to be temping. Or at a minimum using OPKs.  But even then, OPKs can only tell you there is a LH surge, not confirm ovulation. 

Being ""late"" isn't truly a thing if you haven't tracked ovulation -- some cycles are just different lengths. 

As for the spotting, and being due to low progesterone, that is a possibility...but usually goes along with a luteal phase defect. But that would be a 9 day or less LP. Some people truly do just spot in their LP for no apparent reason. Some other reasons are polyps, cysts, endometriosis, and having a sensitive cervix.

What do you mean by pre-pregnancy HCG level? Pre-pregnancy, it should be 0-4. Always. Nothing about progesterone should change that. 

The best/only way to check on your progesterone is to have CD21 testing (which is actually 7DPO testing) on multiple cycles...your 7dpo progesterone level should be 10+. And I say multiple cycles because it can change each cycle and testing once is not indicative of what is truly going on.

One early loss is also not indicative of an inability to stay pregnant. It sucks and I'm incredibly sorry. But it doesn't show a pattern or anything.

I do see that it took ~8 months to conceive your first time. That feels like a LONG time when you're trying, but is not abnormal either. And especially not abnormal for coming off birth control where your body may need a few months to regulate to begin with. Same thing with not conceiving in the 2-3 cycles after loss - bodies often need to heal and regulate so cycles may be off.

With all that said, I am also an advocate of more testing. All the tests. Any test you can get.  I don't see any reason not to bring this up to a doctor and discuss it with them. But I would definitely suggest tracking your cycles more closely if you plan to do that. Data helps! 

I'm all for CD3 testing, CD21 testing, etc. That information can really help some people. 

Good luck!

Good part: She was incredibly kind and sweet. I am high risk and will see her regularly. I will be getting an anatomy scan early in just 5 weeks. She is smart and knew of tons of tests to test placental function and I will be followed closely should I continue to stay pregnant. 

Bad part: It was incredibly discouraging. She doesn't think Lovenox will do anything and, like 2 other MFMs I saw, thinks it's a genetic disorder in the babies. A genetic disorder that is unidentified and doesn't show up on microarray. So it's more a matter of luck and waiting to see if the problem presents itself again or not. Which is so fucking disheartening. Why can't it be a genetic problem that causes a miscarriage at 8 weeks instead of 20 fucking weeks!?

Anyway. I feel very mopey and sad today. I was getting hopeful and optimistic. I told my husband maybe it's good to get me back down to earth. He said probably not. I think he's right. It was nice erring on the side of hope since that's never how I lean. Sigh. I can't believe I just have to wait and see. Again.

I also bought my first this-baby item over the weekend. Our church has a garage sale every October and a lot of the time it's whole estates that get donated. There is always a bunch of vintage stuff that people like me love and since I always ""work"" the sale so I get first dibs. I found an old kids school desk probably from the 30's or 40's for $5! It can totally work for a side table for now since we don't have a room for baby (MIL is occupying it). I also bought a child's tiny size rocking chair for $3.

Some of your feelings resonate with me. I also thought things would get better as time passed. I'm about 3.5 weeks out. I still cry all the time. I wail. I beg for my baby to come back.

I feel guilty (totally irrational). I started having some scary thoughts in the past few days  (for now I can just tell them to go away). I feel like it's actually getting worse and I am wondering if it's from the hormones. My doctor said my progesterone was super low and that because of that I should have a period soon. I've never thought I'd be so hopeful to get a period! I'm thinking I will feel more sane as my hormones balance out. I've been seeing a grief counselor about once a week since it happened, it does help. I do manage to force myself to workout often (what a bunch of shit to have to lose 20lbs and no baby to show for it). I feel like being so down on my body is just making me feel worse though, hence the workouts. I got off my bike after spin today and started crying because my baby was still gone (did I think spinning would bring him back?!) I've never been one prone to mood swings or emotional instability even around that time of the month and now I feel like a crazy person because I'm so emotional. I wish I could tell you it gets better, but I don't have any proof other than that's what everyone tells me, even those who have experienced similar.

I use humor to cope, and you don't give up. Some end up with babies after their first time having sex. Some women endure double-digit losses before they have a baby. Others still go for adoption and start a family that way. 

You can stop, but that isn't giving up. No one knows the right answer to that except for you. It's not always fun. It's not always congrats and baby showers. It's not ever easy, even when it happens just like you dreamed it would. 

I highly recommend therapy. Find a therapist you click with and see if talking about it with a mental health professional gives you an extra helping of strength and resilience.

It also made me realize that I'm likely not the best judge on whether I'm on a path toward dysfunction and ruining my relationships with people.

Your post about seeing a registered psychologist was really helpful, and actually put me a lot more at ease about reaching out to a professional for help.  My work hasn't had a stress management seminar in a while, but I think they have an archive of pre-recorded seminars and training videos.  Hopefully one of them is along the lines of stress management/PTSD.

In your initial comment, you said:

> I will say that likely you'll find benefit from both regular Cognitive behavioural therapy and from something a little more tailored to IF/RPL.

Do you mean to go to two different people for both CBT and IF/RPL, or that you think either would be helpful?  From how you describe CBT (i.e.: examining why I feel X), it sounds like something I try to do already, but I agree that it would be helpful to get some guidance from a professional.

Everything in your most recent comment regarding the changes you made are really insightful.

I felt the same as you in that nothing bad has happened and I didn&#39;t feel like I was spiraling toward any of it, but seeing getting the pictures of SisterB trying on dresses and seeing my friend&#39;s happy family photo album just made me realize how I was not really coping well with everything.  It also made me realize that I&#39;m likely not the best judge on whether I&#39;m on a path toward dysfunction and ruining my relationships with people.</p>

<p>Your post about seeing a registered psychologist was really helpful, and actually put me a lot more at ease about reaching out to a professional for help.  My work hasn&#39;t had a stress management seminar in a while, but I think they have an archive of pre-recorded seminars and training videos.  Hopefully one of them is along the lines of stress management/PTSD.</p>

<p>In your initial comment, you said:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I will say that likely you&#39;ll find benefit from both regular Cognitive behavioural therapy and from something a little more tailored to IF/RPL.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Do you mean to go to two different people for both CBT and IF/RPL, or that you think either would be helpful?  From how you describe CBT (i.e.: examining why I feel X), it sounds like something I try to do already, but I agree that it would be helpful to get some guidance from a professional.</p>

<p>Everything in your most recent comment regarding the changes you made are really insightful.  The next appointment with my OB won&#39;t be until mid December, but I&#39;ll see if his office can offer a referral to a mental health professional without me seeing him first.  If not, I&#39;ll try to find a therapist/registered psychologist myself.</p>

Mostly this looked like taking a moment to examine why I was feeling 'x'. And then to work through whether it was helping or hindering me to react the way I was reacting to my feelings. 

Slightly less confusing to explain, I started doing a gratitude journal, i started really focusing on what goals and achievements and projects I want in my future. Now my spare thoughts were/are more about how full and interesting my life is. Whereas before it was full of what should have been.

<p>And like most people, I don&#39;t want to be a shitty partner or friend. So changing, getting better meant stopping being a shitty partner. I&#39;m not sure there&#39;s anything I would prioritize higher! </p>

<p>So from that realization, I started doing a lot more introspection, self examination. I&#39;ve been to therapy and I&#39;m somewhat familiar with cognitive behavioural techniques. But I&#39;m not sure I&#39;d ever quite &quot;got&quot; how to really enact it properly or fully. Somewhere in this realization that I was being a shit partner and friend and that I needed to shape up came the &quot;oh I get it&quot; moment about how to use CBT for this. </p>

<p>Mostly this looked like taking a moment to examine why I was feeling &#39;x&#39;. And then to work through whether it was helping or hindering me to react the way I was reacting to my feelings. </p>

<p>Slightly less confusing to explain, I started doing a gratitude journal, i started really focusing on what goals and achievements and projects I want in my future. Now my spare thoughts were/are more about how full and interesting my life is. Whereas before it was full of what should have been. </p>

<p>Not sure this all makes sense, but here you go. </p>

I had an appointment yesterday and it was a rough one. I had a growth ultrasound, and I was able to see the screen and I could tell that the baby was measuring small. Turns out he is measuring super small, 6th percentile. They had me on fetal monitoring for a half hour after the ultrasound. It was terrifying. I guess at my 28 week ultrasound, he was measuring in the 15th percentile, but 6th is scary. I feel like a jerk now because I was thinking about how good I felt compared to many of the people in my monthly bumpers group, and turns out I probably feel fine because my kid is still only like 3 pounds or so.

They said that everything else, placenta, cervix, umbilical cord looks fine. However, I am going to get a steroid shot today and tomorrow just in case I do need to deliver early. I will also be monitored twice a week for a half hour on the fetal heart rate monitors.

I wish there was more I can do. I definitely have gained plenty of weight this pregnancy (I'm almost at 30 pounds already), and while I'm not a large woman, I'm not super small either (5'4"" and 140 pounds pre-pregnancy). My husband and I were both small-ish babies, but our moms smoked cigarettes the entire time they were pregnant (it was the '80's). 

Please keep your fingers crossed for me that he keeps growing and hopefully he catches up a bit. 

My baby shower is also this weekend, and I'm suddenly having a hard time with the concept of it. Like, I basically have to go and pretend to 50 people that everything is all fine and dandy and I'm just another glowing pregnant woman, but I still don't know for sure if I'll even be lucky enough to bring home a baby.

Rant two: I remember when I was pregnant with my rainbow (who died as an infant) I worked out how many months I would be pregnant for before I finally got my baby, it was nearing a year and a quarter over about two years time. I posted in baby bumps and it really resonated with a lot of people (it's how I first found out about this sub, but by that point I was pretty confident in the pregnancy so I didn't want to start reading about all the things that *could* go wrong).

Assuming I don't have another miscarriage, I'm still looking down the barrel of an entire pregnancy (hopefully) less than a year after my last. We were pretty sure we were going to have an only child, and even if we'd changed our minds I can guarantee we wouldn't be actively trying on our daughter's nine month birthday (today). I can't believe what I'm putting my arguably old body through. 

And to be perfectly fair, that pregnancy *did* result in a ""healthy"" baby. It was a successful pregnancy, so I almost feel bad for ""counting"" it towards my total time pregnant to get a baby. We *did* technically get the baby...

When I was about 5 weeks along, he confessed that he&#39;d been having excruciating pain in one testicle for more than a month. That brought on more doctors and meds - it appeared to be a hydrocele caused by an unknown virus that has since cleared up - but more importantly his doctor started pressuring him again about getting back on the testosterone injections for his health and recommended starting in the second trimester. I pushed back, because I really feel like this will close the door on any future children (he turns 39 right after our son is due). We ended the conversation about 2 months ago with me asking that he at least look into anti-depressants, if not alternative ways to manage his low testosterone. Now I&#39;m 16 weeks and just found out that he started the testosterone injections at his hydrocele checkup today. I feel like he made the decision to not have more children without me. I tried to talk to him about it, and he just got mad and started angrily talking about his health and mental well-being. I know I should be happy that I have this baby, but I&#39;m terrified that something will happen to him, and now we&#39;ll never be able to try again. I can&#39;t talk to my husband about my fears of another loss because he just says that I&#39;m being negative and worrying for nothing. Also, we got pregnant again so quickly after our loss that I&#39;d really started hoping that maybe 2 biological (living) children could actually happen for me, and now that&#39;s just gone. Sorry for the wall of text...I&#39;m just hurting now.</p>

We have some similarities in that we both have repeat loss and it sounds like all the grief and frustration that goes with that.

Personally I got referred to [a registered psychologist](https://www.reddit.com/r/infertility/comments/6wv8m7/meeting_with_a_registered_psychologist/) by my fertility clinic and at the time I felt like it was overkill. However the first appointment was pretty reasonable and helpful. I have since had a second appointment with her which was also very good. So I can firmly state I am in favour of registered psychologists who have an understanding of infertility, loss and all the ttc bullshit!

The second thing I had happen that was immensely helpful for me, was I went to a seminar at work that was all about stress management. It was meant to be about dealing with the stress and ptsd that can come from work, but almost immediately I realized the whole presentation had a lot more bearing on the excruciating journey that is TTC/RPL/IF. The biggest thing that course did for me was it opened my eyes to just how much I was not coping. Yes I was getting through daily life. Yes nothing bad had happened yet (no divorce, no loss of friends, no job loss, no addiction). But reading all the resources in the presentation, it was clear that I was heading down a path of dysfunction. (or well down it, depending how you look at it.) (I could also wax on about this for ages, it really was an eye opener for me!)

That was the wake up call I needed. 

I don't know if you have access to something like that through your work, or if there is something like that available at large in your community. 

I will say that likely you'll find benefit from both regular Cognitive behavioural therapy and from something a little more tailored to IF/RPL. 

I highly encourage you to take that first step and reach out. It will improve your life so much. :)

Yesterday my daughter turned three and I was a little worried about how I'd handle her birthday. It wound up being so much fun and activity that I didn't have much time to reflect on the day she joined our family, so I didn't consequently compare it to my son's stillbirth. She seemed to have a great day and she totally deserved it-- her third year was so hard on all of us because I spent so much of my pregnancy just kind of phoning in parenting because I tend to be so miserable when I'm pregnant. I just always told myself, ""I'll be better when this baby is out of me,"" but then of course that fundamentally changed our lives and my daughter did not get the same parents back from the hospital that she sent there when I went into labor. I am slowly starting to feel myself return to the parent I feel like I was a year ago-- more engaged and involved with her, but I also know that is potentially short-lived as this pregnancy progresses and my discomfort increases.

I've definitely been experiencing some more nausea-- I can basically only drink LaCroix now, so it's convenient that I got addicted to it over the summer and we've just made a habit of having it on hand. I've never really thrown up during the first trimester unless I was otherwise ill-- I tend to just feel varying levels of what I can only describe as akin to carsickness, all day, for weeks on end. So that's what I've been noticing more often; it's like I'm very aware of my esophagus and every time I need to burp I feel like it's a gamble on whether it will bring something else up with it, but it never does. 

I had some insomnia last night and then I got out of bed at 3am for a bowl of cereal, which is something I tend to do in phases throughout pregnancy. I may go a week or two here or there needing to eat in the middle of the night and then sleep better for a few weeks. And I'm still having crazy dreams-- last night I dreamed that I went to the grand opening of some fancy smoothie shop and they were serving two smoothies. One was a pink and blue cotton candy smoothie and the other one was a rainbow smoothie that had like, chicken and turkey juice in it (????). I ordered the rainbow one because that's what everyone else seemed to be doing and I was thoroughly disgusted by that so I dumped it and got a cotton candy one instead. So... I have to assume between the bonkers dreaming and the nausea that hormones are doing their job. Still over a week until my first ultrasound though and time is CRAWLING.

If you're stumped on where to start, you might consider asking your OB (or RE, if you're seeing one) for a recommendation.

When I arrived at the hospital laboring and expecting to bring home a baby, I was shocked to learn that baby didn't have a heartbeat. My first question was, ""what happened?"" No one knew. My second question was, ""when can I try again?"" Ever since my son was stillborn, two primary trains of thought have governed my mind, my actions, and my life. One is my grief for my son-- the baby I carried to full term and who we were absolutely ready to bring home. The other is the overwhelming, desperate urge for another pregnancy. My midwife said we could begin trying after my first period, which showed up 6 weeks later. My therapist said we could both grieve and endure pregnancy at the same time. We felt we had a lot of support and we started trying right away after my first period came.

For me, what I have needed is that element of activity and hope-- trying for a baby is something I can DO, whereas the grief is just something that happens to me. It hits me like a wave in ways I can't prepare for. But they have wound up being two sides of the same baby loss coin. One makes me feel desolate, one makes me feel empowered.

After our first loss, we decided to wait awhile...I was a mess emotionally. ""Awhile"" was supposed to be ~7 months to get us through some other life events. But as a couple months went by I knew I didn't want to wait that long and my husband and I compromised -- we planned a big vacation and decided to start trying after it. So that put us at the 5 month mark. We conceived again quickly, but had another loss. For me personally, if we'd conceived quickly after our 1st and had the 2 losses closer together, I would not have been ok. I was barely ok anyway! That one landed me in therapy. 

The time off after loss definitely helped me. Now, after that one, we didn't wait...but by that point I was disillusioned to the max and undergoing testing. Grief IS unpredictable and it also isn't linear. You may feel better/less emotional and think you want to try again...then BAM, nope. So hard to say -- you must listen to yourself and your husband.

When to try again is so personal...and yes, to each person not just couple. My husband was adamant that we wait and if I'd pushed for sooner I don't think he'd have been ok with it. Each person processes loss and grief so differently. That's why we made that compromise about our vacation.

I would say to just reevaluate regularly, with both yourself and your husband. Pregnancy after a loss is hard as shit. It seems like the answer, and yes it hopefully gets us to the eventual goal. But its anxiety ridden and just HARD. So sometimes a bit of distance from the last bout of loss is necessary.

As for your period, I hope it comes back quickly and regularly for you. But I don't want you to get your hopes up about that, either. Being like a clock before loss gives no guarantees that your body will regulate back to the same cycle. Many people experience delays in ovulation or longer/shorter/weirder cycles.

Grief IS unpredictable and it also isn&#39;t linear. You may feel better/less emotional and think you want to try again...then BAM, nope. So hard to say -- you must listen to yourself and your husband.</p>

<p>When to try again is so personal...and yes, to each person not just couple. My husband was adamant that we wait and if I&#39;d pushed for sooner I don&#39;t think he&#39;d have been ok with it. Each person processes loss and grief so differently. That&#39;s why we made that compromise about our vacation.</p>

<p>I would say to just reevaluate regularly, with both yourself and your husband. Pregnancy after a loss is hard as shit. It seems like the answer, and yes it hopefully gets us to the eventual goal. But its anxiety ridden and just HARD. So sometimes a bit of distance from the last bout of loss is necessary.</p>

<p>As for your period, I hope it comes back quickly and regularly for you. But I don&#39;t want you to get your hopes up about that, either. Being like a clock before loss gives no guarantees that your body will regulate back to the same cycle. Many people experience delays in ovulation or longer/shorter/weirder cycles.</p>

<p>Best of luck! </p>

For context, I'm not that much further out than she is, 8 months after my 3 week old died, so hopefully some of the following will be relevant. 

If I had a direct line to one of my friends this it what I would ask for: 

I would ask them to understand that I will never be the same person. I would ask them to stop looking for a sign that I'm ""getting better"". I'm not getting better. If it looks like I'm getting better it's because I'm getting really good at faking it, and I find them to be one of the people I need to fake it in front of to make them feel comfortable. 

There is nothing you can say to make her feel better, so your best bet is not to try. There is no ""at least"". 

Follow her cues on religion, do not say anything about god, or plans, or angels in heaven unless she says it first and explicitly declares that is what she believes. 

Talk about her daughter every time you see her. Use her name. If your friend cries remember that you didn't make her cry by bringing up her child, you *let* her cry by talking about her. She is always thinking of her, you can't ""remind"" her. (Obviously if your friend says ""today is not the day"" follow her lead).

Dig through your phone for any photo of her daughter. Even if you took one that's fuzzy and her face is turned the wrong way. Your friend wants to see it.

Remember her daughter's birthday. Not just next year, but fifteen years from now. Remember the anniversary of the day she died. My aunt emails my husband and I every month with a photo of her lit candle on the date anniversary of my daughter's death. it means so, so much to us that she lights a candle for her every month. In our case it's not a religious thing, but I believe it comes from a catholic tradition. 

If your friend has a partner that you're close with, remember that he or she has lost their child as well. My husband doesn't have the same social network that I do, and it has meant the world to him when ""my"" (as opposed to ""our"") friends have reached out to check in on him, just him. 

Most of all listen, it sounds like you're the kind of friend who's got that covered already. You are really a gem of a friend for asking how to help.

I don't think that's necessarily true. I know little about IVF (we don't want to do it), but -- from what I've read on that group -- several couples have translocations that are observable under a karyotype and who were told that PGD and PGS cannot be used to detect them. From what I understand, PGD and PGS can only detect certain translocations and rearrangements. If you do not know which rearrangement you have, PGD and PGS may say an embryo looks good, but it could still have the parents rearrangement. Many couples in that group decide to try naturally, despite wanting to do IVF, because they were told IVF w/ PGD or PGS couldn't do anything for their particular chromosomes, and they didn't want to spend the money.

Again, I'd recommend the group, even if you don't know if you have a translocation.

So I had a D&C on June 27th at what should have been 12.5 weeks. The fetus had stopped developing at 7 weeks, and just like the pregnancy before that one, my body was showing no signs of miscarrying. I had had a difficult experience with misoprostol (2 doses and a 5-day wait before anything happened), so I opted for a D&C. We also wanted genetic testing, so that seemed like the best option.

Well... at my 2-week followup I was still bleeding too much for my comfort, or my OBGYN's. She told me to call for an ultrasound if the bleeding didn't stop within the next week. A few days later, I started passing big clots and gushing blood, just like you described. I called my doctor's emergency line and they scheduled me for an ultrasound the next morning and told me to go to the ER if it got worse (thankfully it didn't).

On the ultrasound, there was still retained tissue, so they scheduled my second D&C for the next day. They did an ultrasound-guided one and were sure they got everything and that anything left would be so small as to not cause issues.

Since I have a 26-day cycle and my body is fucking relentless, I got my period 4 days after the 2nd D&C because of course. But then the bleeding transitioned from ""definitely my period"" to ""this is still from the pregnancy, isn't it?"" Luckily, it was light enough to handle.

I bled lightly or spotted until my next period started on August 20th (3 days late), and had a pretty normal period. Except that I FINALLY passed the last bit of retained tissue. It was about the size of my pinky nail. When that period ended, it was finally over and I stopped bleeding completely.

And the doctors started tracking my HCG levels sometime after the 2nd D&C, though I don't remember when exactly. I had the last blood draw on August 20th when that period started, and my levels were FINALLY 5 that day.

The fetus had stopped developing at 7 weeks, and just like the pregnancy before that one, my body was showing no signs of miscarrying. I had had a difficult experience with misoprostol (2 doses and a 5-day wait before anything happened), so I opted for a D&amp;C. We also wanted genetic testing, so that seemed like the best option.</p>

<p>Well... at my 2-week followup I was still bleeding too much for my comfort, or my OBGYN&#39;s. She told me to call for an ultrasound if the bleeding didn&#39;t stop within the next week. A few days later, I started passing big clots and gushing blood, just like you described. I called my doctor&#39;s emergency line and they scheduled me for an ultrasound the next morning and told me to go to the ER if it got worse (thankfully it didn&#39;t).</p>

<p>On the ultrasound, there was still retained tissue, so they scheduled my second D&amp;C for the next day. They did an ultrasound-guided one and were sure they got everything and that anything left would be so small as to not cause issues.</p>

<p>Since I have a 26-day cycle and my body is fucking relentless, I got my period 4 days after the 2nd D&amp;C because of course. But then the bleeding transitioned from &quot;definitely my period&quot; to &quot;this is still from the pregnancy, isn&#39;t it?&quot; Luckily, it was light enough to handle.</p>

<p>I bled lightly or spotted until my next period started on August 20th (3 days late), and had a pretty normal period. Except that I FINALLY passed the last bit of retained tissue. It was about the size of my pinky nail. When that period ended, it was finally over and I stopped bleeding completely.</p>

<p>And the doctors started tracking my HCG levels sometime after the 2nd D&amp;C, though I don&#39;t remember when exactly. I had the last blood draw on August 20th when that period started, and my levels were FINALLY 5 that day.</p>

<p>I hope that helps and that your experience ends up being a more pleasant one!</p>

My husband has a new work colleague. He is a vet and she is a new grad, started a few months ago. After two weeks, she finds out she's pregnant. Not planned. Thats fine, I only begrudge her because I'm a bitter woman. She's been sort of partnered with my husband for on call weekends and things, so he's been picking up a lot of her slack. Not because she's sick or incapable, but because she's scared she will be randomly kicked by an animal and lose the baby. Valid point I guess, but it should probably be taken up with her boss in my view. Instead she goes into the work calendar and changes the appointments to be under my husbands name. They are large animal vets and it's spring, so he's already so busy. 
Then she starts complaining that she doesn't want to touch sheep because they can carry toxoplasmosis and she might lose the baby. This is what our baby died of, and it's driving my husband insane, but he refuses to tell her we lost a baby. I'm so surprised that none of his workmates have pulled her aside and said he's the wrong person to be complaining to about it. It drives me crazy. Sure, have concerns, but if you're so worried that you can't do your job you should probably leave. 
It all came to a head and my husband ended up yelling at her in front of all their colleagues about her being lazy. Luckily management were understanding and she is being ""dealt"" with. 
I don't know what it must be like to be partnered with someone who just talks about being pregnant all day after your own baby died without losing it. I feel so bad for him.
