We are both in separate talk therapy, which was free through my work. I talk to a therapist weekly and he moved his to monthly. I asked him why last night and he said he felt like he was moving in the right direction but sometime on Sunday, he just crashed. I think he crashed because I have not been doing so well. I had a really nice stretch of not crying all the time, i think like 8 days, then all of a sudden, I started losing my shit during my last period. I started thinking horribly dark thoughts and I was contemplating medication but then that kind of lifted as the hormones resolved some. Now, its our fertile week, which gives me hope and I feel closer to him during these times. We had such a fun fertile week last month and this month just seems encompassed in sadness. So as the covid restrictions are lifting, i found a different therapist who will do in person visits and CBT because honestly I would love to avoid medication. I know this grief is new and raw and I have no experience with it and neither does he. 

I love the idea of asking my therapist about how to manage my grief and help him as well. I am naturally a helper as I am in healthcare and I hate to see him struggling because I know I can't save us both.

Now I feel super stupid. I was surprised just how badly I wanted to be a mom and now I just sob at the fear that I will never be one. I just want to climb back to my life as we knew it and I can't.

I have found that this type of grief hits people differently, and that the way we experience our grief is not something we can completely control. My own experience has been more like your husband's -- almost unrelenting shame, guilt, profound sadness -- while my spouse's grief has been more like yours. We are both (separately) in therapy. Because of our different grief experiences, one of the things he uses his therapy sessions for is to get help and advice on living with my grief and supporting me through it. Regardless of what your husband does, if *you* have access to talk therapy, you might find someone who can help you work through your own grief and also strategize about how to take care of yourself and your spouse when you're married to someone who is going through what your husband is. I think that could be a valuable resource for both of you.

It's interesting, in kind of a horrible way... I have been profoundly surprised by the way I have experienced this loss. Before my pregnancy, I thought that if I ever needed to TFMR, I would be able to do it with sadness, maybe, but with no doubts and no agonizing indecision and no soul-crushing guilt. I never suspected that those things would be part of my experience. I guess you just can't predict until you're actually in the situation.

One final note: 10 weeks is not a long time. This situation is going to keep evolving, for both of you. It took me almost twice that time before I was able to stop thinking about my TFMR situation as something that I could have ""solved"" if I had just found the right answer, and started thinking of it more like a natural disaster -- something huge and unavoidable that just happened, that there was no good answer for, and no real escape from.

Physically, I feel great and could get back into exercising at any time. But at almost 7 weeks pp, I'm still bleeding. After a tearful phone call to the OB's office last week where I was told that bleeding is normal up to 12 weeks pp, I did some reddit sleuthing and read a ton of anecdotal accounts from other women. The bleeding stories ranged from 3-12 weeks like the OB said, but several said their bleeding was exacerbated or prolonged when they increased their activity, even if it was simple stuff like housework. 

My self care for this week is to do nothing. 

I'm day 2 into a week where I don't do anything beyond standing up to go to the bathroom and shower and get meals that my husband thankfully will cook. No getting my 250 steps for the hour (thanks FitBit). No walks around the neighborhood. No baking, which requires a lot of standing. Nothing. The OB's office said I could exercise if I want, but I'm not convinced. My bleeding got a lot heavier a couple weeks ago when I started getting more active. I notice a decrease in the flow when I'm less active. I also bought a box of raspberry leaf tea and am drinking multiple cups per day because I read it can help reduce postpartum bleeding. 

This lack of activity sucks. I'm 8 lbs heavier than I was when I got pregnant and I'd love to get back to working out so I can build some of the muscle I lost and shed some of this weight. But I'm at my wit's end with the bleeding. I just want it to end. I think I've shot myself in the foot by not taking it easy as I should have, because I'm not letting the wound inside me heal.

However, what can be useful from app info is the average length of your luteal phase - that tends to be something that remains constant, so essentially once you know you've ovulated, you can estimate when your period is likely to arrive (your ovulation CD + your LP).

As such, you may well still be yet to ovulate this cycle, so if you were not tracking ovulation, it would seem like your period was 'late'.  It would not be; it would just be that you ovulated a little later than usual.  There is also the consideration of an anovulatory cycle, the odd one here and there is completely normal.

I use and highly recommend the ClearBlue Advanced Digital (CBAD) Ovulation kits - it lets you know well in advance as to when you could be entering your FW, and with their smiley-face statuses, it's 100% clear when it detects your LH surge.  Their marketing blurb claims it does this by [establishing your own personal LH baseline](https://images-eu.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/C1THFLjIJZS.pdf) (see p4) vs. using a stick which has a pre-set baseline (i.e. the mIU level).

I find this very reassuring as I was never someone that got a super-duper obvious positive using cheapies alone - I can really only see what strip was my darkest one in retrospect which isn't very helpful.  I do still use cheapies, but only as an extra confirmatory measure alongside CBAD.  CBAD is my primary tool to let me know it's 'go time'.

<p>I am currently going through an early miscarriage again, and am terrified the same thing will happen.</p>

I had a MMC at 8+3 (heartbeat had likely stopped just days before) and had my D&C a week later. I had a very positive experience. I was put under for the procedure (twilight sleep, so I was breathing on my own). I asked them for Zofran in my IV which prevented nausea from the anesthesia. (I still had all my pregnancy symptoms and nausea was in full force.)

I had to be alone before the procedure but my husband was able to come see me once I was awake and sitting up. Last thing I remember is laying down on the table. The next thing I knew I was sitting in a chair, groggy but in no pain. 

My recovery was easy, physically. Minimal bleeding the day of and day after. Around day 5 I had some pretty bad cramps and some more bleeding for a few hours, but none after that. My nausea was greatly decreased the say after and totally gone by 4 days after. Honestly the worst part was the hormone crash which has made me extremely emotional. I still cry at the drop of a hat (I’m 2.5 weeks post now), but the first week was the worst. I’ve also picked up some weight inexplicably, so I’m wondering if the hormone change has something to do with that.

I was seen 8 days after for a scan and everything looked fine. She says there was a blood clot in my uterus but she was not concerned. She gave me the OK for sex. (Doctor who did the surgery said 2 weeks but my RE said that is conservative and that one week is fine. Obviously, consult with your doctor.) I had an HCG blood draw 2 days ago and it was 209, so I’m still impatiently waiting to get to zero.

I am very glad I chose this route. Personally, I would not have been able to handle misoprostol and expectant management could have taken weeks in my case. I was still very sick all day long, and I really wanted the pregnancy “out of me” once I knew the baby wasn’t alive. Also, I was able to get genetic testing on the embryo (standard at my hospital) and found out she had trisomy 22. I’m more at risk for that due to my age but it was a relief that nothing I did caused the miscarriage. A warning- you do find out the sex if you have this done, because the results look like this: 47, XX, + 22.

My one frustration was that I specifically asked the operating doc if he would do an ultrasound when he was done to check did retained products. He was quite dismissive and said “I’ve been doing this procedure for 40 years- there’s no need.” Fortunately, he did seem to do a good job (I hope- getting a saline ultrasound after my next cycle starts to check for scarring), but that annoyed me. I would recommend asking that they do that for you.

I was put under twilight anesthesia and the procedure took about 30 minutes. They placed an IV and that's how they administered drugs, and they placed a simple oxygen mask on during surgery. My recovery was very quick, I was able to dress myself, however they wheeled me out in a chair to my husband's vehicle. My husband took me to get some lunch through a drive-thru afterwards, made a quick stop at JoAnns for some fabric, then back home where we spent the day together. I was prescribed some pain medication that I have not taken, instead I opted for OTC NSAIDs. My husband went to work the next day. I will be taking Monday off more for mental health than physical health. We arrived to the hospital at 8:30am, procedure began at 11:20 and discharged by 1:00.

I began spotting and severely cramping Wednesday (the day before) and I actually went to my OBGYNs office to see if we really needed to go through with surgery still since my miscarriage was actually beginning. After a quick US my doctor advised to proceed as planned. After experiencing just that short amount of natural miscarriage I <b>never</b> wish to do so again. It was the worst cramping of my life in addition to the most bleeding and tissue discharge I've ever experienced. On top of this, I had to endure a very uncomfortable COVID test, which may have been worse than anything else related to surgery.

Since my surgery there has been very minimal bleeding and cramping that a heating pad and ibuprofen have been enough to combat.

Two and a half years ago I had a D&C with hysteroscopy (unrelated to any MC issues) where I was intubated and placed under general anesthesia. That was an altogether different (and horrible) experience. Because of that I was reluctant to proceed, but after this stand alone D&C I would happily elect to have another after any future loss. 

Although it's only been two days, I feel like there has finally been closure and I am honestly feeling so much better. While I'm still very sad that my first pregnancy ended, I no longer have the overwhelming grief and dread that I had before while my womb was acting as a tomb. (The fetus measured behind at my first US, told to come back in 2 weeks which was the Friday before Memorial Day and development had stalled - then due to holiday and wanting to have the procedure with my own doctor, the D&C didn't happen until nearly a week after that... It was essentially 3 weeks of hell, with at least a week and a half of that where I was convinced then knew I was having a MMC and just grief stricken and miserable.)

My doctor arrived and they wheeled me into the operating room. They put my legs up in stirrups and the put me under.

I felt cramping immediately (like heavy period cramps) and they gave me some juice so they could remove my IV. They let me go to the bathroom to put my clothes on and put on a very large pad.

My next couple cycles evened out more but that was something I wasn’t expecting.</p>

<p>Wishing you a speedy recovery 💕</p>

Just FYI, when I was doing some research around this post, I learnt there is something called an 'ovulation bleed' which can happen at the cycle mid-point.

But it would be probably be a good idea to call your OB.  It’s possible that scar tissue could have built up post surgery.  If you have a tendency to get keloid scars then that is a likely possibility that it’s caused a blockage.  

If you’ve had cramps or pain on the side of the surgery that’s a good indicator there’s scar tissue build up also. That’s what happened to me after I had surgery to remove tissue in my Fallopian tubes.

Coincidentally, I had an u/s the day my period started (last Friday) as I'd rang my EPU up with a concern that since the main bleed from my surgery stopped, I was still experiencing pink discharge when exercising/exerting myself, and that I also continued to have an extremely faint shadow on a 10mIU HPT.  They had me in to make sure there was no RPOC, and everything was clear.  They also did a HPT there and it was negative (although I think mine was more sensitive).  I think my brain/body just needed to feel like 'I was being heard', as sure enough, my period started later that same day.

I remember asking the nurse how I would know it was here because I had read about some people's first one post-MC being very light, and she reassured me I would be able to tell the difference between it and spotting - sure enough come the pad-filling on Saturday I was 100%!

Being that it's only been eight days since nothing being seen in my uterus, I had a very heavy bleed over several days between then and now, and I haven't any signs of ovulation yet for this cycle, I'm certain this has nothing to do with a new pregnancy or a mid-cycle ovulation bleed.

I've never had *red* spotting after my period properly finished, but definitely everything can just be crazy in the cycle after MC.  I think it sounds like what you propose at the end - the body trying to regulate itself again.  It's all very weird!

Glad to hear that you were able to track your ovulation for that cycle and the spotting didn't throw any of that off - my cycles pre-MC were around the 25-27 day mark, so I have a 10 day margin for error adding in my 37 day post-MC one.

I know this wasn’t one of your questions, but just want to mention it anyway that you should wait 2 weeks post d&c to heal properly and avoid infection as infection can impact your future fertility and can cause scarring. 

You should be able to have sex after the two weeks even if you’re still bleeding. Just do what makes you comfortable. After my D&C I bled for two weeks and continued to spot until I ovulated.

Since HCG can interfere with OPKs, when I’ve lost a pregnancy I’ll start doing OPKs a couple weeks after the loss and if the OPK is positive I’ll take a pregnancy test with the same urine. If The HPT has a faint line, then I can’t trust the OPK (false positive). I’ll do this until I get a true OPK negative and then i know I can trust that the next OPK positive will actually be because of an LH surge. 

The HPTs I use (Pregmate) can detect down to 25 HCG. The instructions in the HPT box you’re using should say what level of HCG the test is validated for. If you’re seeing a faint line on your  HPT, you’ve probably hit the validated threshold. You probably won’t ovulate until you have a completely negative HPT. 

I don’t know anything about uterus shrinking, but I had my D&C at 14 weeks. My OB gave us her blessing to try right away. No one mentioned anything about uterus needing to shrink to be ready for a new pregnancy. (Someone else chime in here if you know something I don’t)

You can get pregnant the cycle immediately following a D&C (or MC). There isn’t good evidence to suggest an increased risk to the pregnancy and there may be a slight advantage to getting pregnant the first 3 months after a MC. 

I hope I didn’t miss anything. Let me know if any of this needs clarification. Best of luck to you this cycle and take care ❤️",[],,t1_fs6anew,False,0,[],False,"<div class=""md""><p>Trying to answer all of your questions here. Sorry if this comes across choppy.</p>

This is a timely question because I am actually seeing a Maternal Fetal Medicine specialist (high risk OB) at the hospital tomorrow morning for a pre-pregnancy consultation. 

I delivered at 22+2. It was unexpected and the pathology report on my placenta showed infections, which probably is what triggered labor. I saw the OB who discharged me from the hospital at one and five weeks postpartum. At my one week appointment, he told me that he would refer me to the MFM after my next appointment and order an ultrasound and bloodwork to rule out other issues. At my five week appointment, I had my blood drawn and got a referral for a pelvic ultrasound to rule out structural issues with my uterus. I had that done last week and all seemed normal with the ultrasound. 

He explained to me that in my next pregnancy, because I am now high risk, I will be seeing the regular OBs in addition to the MFM. I do not know how often my appointments would be, but I'd be monitored more closely, which probably means cervical checks, ultrasounds, maybe more bloodwork? My OB said I could come in every week for reassurance if I needed during my next pregnancy.

I am under the impression that working with an MFM in addition to the regular OB is (or should be) standard in high risk cases like ours. I am happy with how my OB is handling this. The practice I go to has over 10 OBs and midwives and you're supposed to rotate through as many as possible during your pregnancy, which is what I did. The one I'm working with now never saw me prior to the hospital. I would try to see this doctor & the one who delivered my daughter as much as I could, since they're the ones most familiar with my case. Of course I am not opposed to seeing other doctors as needed.

I will try to remember to update tomorrow after my appointment, once I get a clearer idea of what the MFM thinks. Hopefully you get some good info from other people who have experienced this.

I&#39;ve been testing at 12:30 pm every day, but when I caught my LH surge for my pregnancy, I was testing at around 4-4:30 pm every day (and on the day I caught my surge I was super dehydrated and hadn&#39;t drank nearly as much water as I normally do). I do not test multiple times per day. Today, my temperature spiked, so if it&#39;s not a fluke and it remains up for 3 consecutive days, then that confirms ovulation. I can&#39;t help wondering if it&#39;s a fluke because the weather has taken a turn so the room is warmer now than it was a few days ago. Time will tell.</p>

<p>The OPKs aren&#39;t foolproof. Some women have a weaker surge, sometimes the dilution of your urine throws things off, sometimes you have a few days of buildup and your peak is incredibly quick and then it&#39;s over (seems to be my case), etc. </p>

<p>Sending virtual hugs. All this is stressful.</p>

This time I am going to start the progesterone after ovulation but my OB only prescribed me 100 mg a day. Does that seem low?

<p>I have had two chemicals this year. Waiting to hear back about my RPL results. In the meantime, still proceeding with letrozole so that if my results come back normal we can try this month.
Here’s my question. I was prescribed progesterone supplements last time but didn’t start taking them till I already knew I was pregnant. I think I have a short luteal phase (I don’t always track ovulation, just do EOD basically until right after my period ends up until like day 23) and always have spotting beforehand. This time I am going to start the progesterone after ovulation but my OB only prescribed me 100 mg a day. Does that seem low? Everything I’m reading on this sub says most people do 100 mg multiple times a day. Should I push for more? It can’t hurt can it?</p>

As if I hadn&#39;t done a crash course to become familiar with like, all knowledge that has ever been published about this! As if I didn&#39;t look for every available resource! As if I didn&#39;t take this <em>seriously</em>! For what it&#39;s worth: I know that I did, literally, everything I could to get all the relevant information, and that I made the best guess I could with the knowledge that was available. And for what it&#39;s worth #2: I am completely sure in my heart that you did the same.</p>

<p>I feel like I keep finding new dimensions to this kind of loss -- just when I think I&#39;ve fully explored the landscape, someone will say something or send me an email or whatever and I find some new twisty little fractal corners of sadness and pain. I am so sorry that you are going through this, too.</p>

Your loss is so fresh that on top of the grief there's the physical part. Your body is still full of pregnancy hormones and feels that there should be a baby when there isn't. It's a very physical, very primal kind of pain. That part, I promise, will get easier with time. There will always be the certain kind of sadness, it comes in waves, but the kind of pain you're feeling right now isn't forever. 

I'm not going to lie, trying to get pregnant and possible new pregnancy will never kind of be the same again. It's different, bittersweet and terrifying. Kind that people who haven't experience a loss will never fully understand.

I&#39;m sad and I&#39;m desperate and I&#39;m obsessed and it&#39;s all I can think about. I&#39;m pitying myself and I&#39;m weirdly praying to a god I don&#39;t even believe in out of total and compete desperation.</p>

She said that it is not uncommon for pregnancy to result in ppt among women with and without a history of thyroid autoimmune conditions — but again, it was
My antibodies that tipped her off.  The problem was that we couldn’t figure out if it was underlying Graves or hashi bc my tsh was all I’ve the place.

She did a full evaluation of my historical symptoms and said that also provided data that made her feel confident that it was ppt with underlying hashimotos.

It also helps in a really mean, selfish way that i’m not proud of that, after gaining a lot of independence (her now second youngest is 13), she now has to do the whole mom thing again and i don’t think she really thought about that beforehand- she’ll have one starting kindergarten the same year that kid graduates high school.</p>

OPK’s are ovulation predictor kits, they’re just sticks you pee on that help you predict when you’re ovulating, which gives you more info about your fertile window. 

Some advantages to tracking ovulation (which can include OPKs, temp tracking, tracking cervical mucus, etc), are:

- Having a better idea of when your fertile window is. For example, while my app was telling my I was ovulating on cycle day 15, it turns out I ovulate a bit late in my cycle and was ovulating around CD 21, so I was getting my fertile days all wrong and by the time I actually actually ovulated I’d thought I was way past my fertile window. 

- Potentially picking up on issues, like if you have a very short luteal phase or if you’re not ovulating at all, these tracking methods can help you bring up questions to your doctor in a more accurate and informed way. 

- Gaining data and information about your body. You can learn a lot about your cycle and your body’s patterns by tracking that can help you pick up on inconsistencies later that can point to problems or pregnancy

- Can help quell worries when you do become pregnant. Like I said, I ovulate about a week later than the “normal” CD14 number, so when I did go to my doctor with a positive test, and she did an early ultrasound, at first she was worried because the embryo was measuring a week behind, but when I told her about my tracking, she relaxed and told me that all made sense and the information was helpful to determine my pregnancy was progressing normally, which of course after a miscarriage was a huge relief to hear, I was so grateful I’d decided to track so I could feel less concerned.

It's unlikely that I'll ever feel the unspoilt joy of pregnancy again. It'll probably always be tainted by worry but I don't think there's much else to but take it one day at a time.

I'm a medical professional; after reading your post I've done some reading in my resources about ureaplasma (admittedly I was unfamiliar with it before now). What I'm reading is not very clear. Apparently upwards of 90% of healthy pregnant women are colonized with ureaplasma.  It seems there is some overlap between adverse pregnancy outcomes and the presence of ureaplasma sp., But what I'm reading states it's not certain whether it's a causal relationship. Were your doctors concerned about infection (you don't have to answer if you don't want to)? Do they think ureaplasma could be related to your previous miscarriages? I know there are antibiotics that are safe in pregnancy that treat ureaplasma... Perhaps they can just prescribe them? 

Anyway, without actually knowing your situation, I want to hope that the ureaplasma colonization is coincidental and that you'll carry this pregnancy to term. Best wishes ❤️

<p>Anyway, without actually knowing your situation, I want to hope that the ureaplasma colonization is coincidental and that you&#39;ll carry this pregnancy to term. Best wishes ❤️</p>

Retained products from miscarrying naturally or medicated is also a risk (which would then require a D&amp;C anyways), and like you experienced, it can be a prolonged process, which can take a big emotional toll.

For my first miscarriage, it was discovered at 9+3 and I was only measuring 7+4. I had a D&C. This was from a spontaneous pregnancy while I was on a waitlist for IVF, and the doc said that D&C would likely have the quickest recovery time because with natural or misoprostol there is a risk  (albeit small) of retained products of conception prolonging things. 

For my second miscarriage, it was found at 8+4. I was measuring at 8+3 and there was no heartbeat. No heartbeat confirmed a week later. This was in the first couple of weeks of COVID lockdown stuff, so a D&C was considered elective and not an option. My doc recommended misoprostol but I refused, because I have taken it before (for polyp removal prep) and it was horrible. I had extreme versions of the entire list of side effects. I finally miscarried naturally starting at 11+2. I bled/spotted for more than 3 weeks.

If you don’t get your period in a few days I would test again. Best wishes for you!!</p>

My first thought is I'm glad your RE is honest with you but I'd call them back and ask them to look into this and give you an answer. It costs money to go to an RE and they should be giving you answers- it really says something if you still have to come onto a TTC forum cause your RE said I dunno. Next time you get pregnant stop taking it right away or stop taking it during your luteal phase? It's probably fine to take during follicular phase and pause on it during your luteal phases if you want to be safe. I do that with things I'm not 100% confident I want to continue if I get pregnant. 

When I had my MMC I was convinced it was my fault. I was drinking hibiscus tea at the time and because it was herbal/non-caffeine I thought it was safe cause no caffeine. So for a while I thought I had done it to myself. Or maybe it was the milk (low fat, not organic) I was drinking. When I was looking for reasons to blame myself I found lots of them. I had started working out more and I had been doing sit-ups and ab exercises. Oh you name it- it was my fault. Every little thing I did I saw it as something I did that jeopardized everything. Now, I realize it was a blighted ovum and nothing was going to turn that blighted ovum into a living child. I may as well have been drink all the coffee and drinking all the wine. Didn't make a damn difference. Was never up to me anyway. 

My obgyn sat me down and had a serious chat with me at the time because I was seriously struggling. I brought the tea and the milk and so on into the clinic. Every vitamin pill. Did this do it? Did this? She basically said look, there are crackheads out there popping out babies. Babies are so resilient. No tea I drank or sit up or sandwich ruined it all. She couldn't tell me why it happened but her best guess was that it was a chromosomal issue and not something that hibiscus tea or an abdominal muscle contraction could have prevented, caused, or been fixed. 

Bottom line: not your fault. Your body can get pregnant. I doubt stopping the myo-inositol did it. Seriously. You were doing everything you could back then to be successful and you are doing all you can now. Give yourself some credit- you *are* seeing doctors, taking supplements, trying to get answers.

He said 7 days of bleeding for my first period is normal (hoping today isn't day 8...).

A quick pelvic exam to check my uterus showed all is fine in terms of size.

I had at least 8 vials of blood drawn for an extensive blood panel: antinuclear antibodies,  anticardiolipin antibodies, thyroid panel (this will probably be normal since I'm under the care of an endocrinologist and taking levothyroxine), prothrombin (factor II) G20210 mutation, factor V mutation, and lupus anticoagulant.

I have a pelvic ultrasound scheduled for tomorrow to check for uterine structural issues or abnormalities like a septum.

He referred me to the MFM for a pre-pregnancy consultation and said if they don't call me by the end of the week to schedule an appointment, to let him know.

I'm so, so glad he's taking me seriously and being super thorough. Even if the tests show nothing is wrong, it's good to rule everything out. He said I can start TTC next month and is convinced I'll be pregnant and back again by September. I know no one can be certain, so I wouldn't go that far in my optimism, but I have to hold on to some shred of hope.

Know that you did all that you could, and none of this is your fault. I struggle with guilt and thinking about all the things I could have done differently. 

I lost my Isabel at 22+2 on April 14th due to surprise labor (the OB thinks it was an infection). She was born alive but passed within an hour. I, too, had an anterior placenta. I felt her movements, but I never felt true kicking, so I understand what you mean. I was eagerly anticipating getting to 24 weeks and feeling consistent movement, as the ultrasound tech at my 20 week anatomy scan said I would. I had just started building a registry for her, but hadn't purchased anything yet. I deleted the registry the day after she died. 

Like others said, be kind to yourself and grieve however you need. Grief is love with nowhere to go. You will never stop grieving your baby because you will never stop loving her. In speaking with other mothers who have experienced the loss of their baby, I know that the grief gets less intense over time. I suggest therapy and trying to find an online support group until you can go to one in person. You are not alone, so don't try to shoulder this burden alone.

A coworker of mine lost her baby at 24 weeks due to complications from pre-eclampsia and had a classical c-section. I think the standard advice is to wait a year to conceive again, although their doctor said they'd only recommend 6 months because she was older than 35 when it happened. Perhaps your doctor will give you the green light before a year is up. We, too, are thinking about TTC for Isabel's sibling, and it feels hard and exhausting because all we want is our Isabel back.

I was supposed to be 9 weeks and 4 days days today...

I felt something slip out right before the doctor lifted my gown for the pelvic exam. I looked for whatever it was when I was dressing up in the room by myself. It was the sac. I broke down. The doctor hadn’t even confirmed the miscarriage at that point but I didn’t need him to say it. I knew what I was looking at. It was like being in one of the vivid nightmares I’ve been having the past weeks. Except I couldn’t wake up. 

The doctor came back and told me what he suspects. From the way he was talking, it was clear he didn’t see the sac fall out earlier. It must’ve gotten tucked away somehow for him not to notice it... I had to point it out to him. He took one look and confirmed it. 

I’m sad. It was supposed to be our first baby. I don’t know how to make my husband feel better... 

I don’t know what to say to my sis-in-law (who is also expecting - our due dates were 4–5 days apart)...

I don’t know what to say to my parents and brother....

I don’t know.. I feel so empty. 

Also, I see posts here where people can date when they had a MC (ex. 11 weeks along but baby passed at 6 weeks etc.) May I ask how can you guys tell? The reason I ask if that when I saw the sac, there wasn’t a baby as formed as what I thought 9 weeks should be...?",[],,t1_fr7hbjx,False,0,[],False,"<div class=""md""><p>Just came back from the Emergency where the doctor confirmed that I miscarried... I was supposed to be 9 weeks and 4 days days today...</p>

<p>I felt something slip out right before the doctor lifted my gown for the pelvic exam. I looked for whatever it was when I was dressing up in the room by myself. It was the sac. I broke down. The doctor hadn’t even confirmed the miscarriage at that point but I didn’t need him to say it. I knew what I was looking at. It was like being in one of the vivid nightmares I’ve been having the past weeks. Except I couldn’t wake up. </p>

<p>The doctor came back and told me what he suspects. From the way he was talking, it was clear he didn’t see the sac fall out earlier. It must’ve gotten tucked away somehow for him not to notice it... I had to point it out to him. He took one look and confirmed it. </p>

<p>I’m sad. It was supposed to be our first baby. I don’t know how to make my husband feel better... </p>

<p>I don’t know what to say to my sis-in-law (who is also expecting - our due dates were 4–5 days apart)...</p>

I feel frustrated with a lot of the things you said cause it's real for me, it's similar to me. I'm a recently disabled veteran and I was active duty up until the end of last year. I apologize for this being long- I think you post deserves a full response.

I had similar experiences getting gynecological care while serving. I felt very alone while I was going through it. I felt completely unsupported by my unit plus my husband and I were stationed apart for 18 months. And during that time I would get my superiors pulling me aside to give me fertility advice or tell me I should be getting pregnant. 1) none of their fucking business and 2) how dare they and 3) what a sexist environment. The whole thing was totally soul crushing and felt intentionally cruel. I know what it's like to be stuck going to the doctors on post and I know what it's like to be turned away when you feel like you desperately need a doctor to look into things and HELP you. My only advice is if you have any funds set aside go ahead and take this into your own hands.

If you can go ahead and order your own tests online. Modern Fertility ($150 I think), LetsGetChecked, Alpha, and a ton of other companies offer at-home tests with similarish price points. You can look at AMH, FSH, estrogen/progesterone, thyroid hormones etc. My current obgyn does all these tests for me and my insurance covers it but if she wouldn't do the tests for me? Girlfriend, I would have gotten them myself. I can't be waiting on other people to make the calls in my life anymore. I am so sick of waiting for permission to have healthcare or to make babies. I know some people will tell you to keep pushing but my guess is that they are going to stand firm with their stance on not testing until 3 losses. Talk about a lack of compassion. Which is insane. And stressful. And so demoralizing. Personally, I would move on and get care off-post.

If you go off-post for care then don't be talking about it with your comrades. I doubt the military wants you seeing docs off post and obviously it's not going to be covered. So find out in advance what it's going to cost. This might be another good reason to take testing into your own hands. If you have test results then when you do make appointments you can be very clear about what concern needs to be addressed. Find an RE or another obgyn who is willing to work with you, who can prescribe whatever you may need. If all else fails call up a nearby Planned Parenthood and discuss your situation and find out what services are available to you. Mainly the testing and prescriptions. This is why they exist.

I wouldn't wait on the military to give you answers. You are going to be waiting for so long. If I could go back I wouldn't have waited, I wouldn't have held out for the care, I wouldn't have worried so much about my career or being the strongest female in my unit or besting all the guys (and I did- and I ate that respect up). I would have just gotten help somewhere else and healthcare somewhere else.

Find an RE or another obgyn who is willing to work with you, who can prescribe whatever you may need. If all else fails call up a nearby Planned Parenthood and discuss your situation and find out what services are available to you. Mainly the testing and prescriptions. This is why they exist.</p>

<p>I wouldn&#39;t wait on the military to give you answers. You are going to be waiting for so long. If I could go back I wouldn&#39;t have waited, I wouldn&#39;t have held out for the care, I wouldn&#39;t have worried so much about my career or being the strongest female in my unit or besting all the guys (and I did- and I ate that respect up). I would have just gotten help somewhere else and healthcare somewhere else.</p>

<p>Anyway, always here if you need to talk. Again, I&#39;m sorry for you situation. I wish this wasn&#39;t happening to you. I&#39;ll be keeping you in my thoughts and prayers.</p>

After my first loss (18 weeks) I was told I can try as soon as hpt is negative and bleeding has stopped. We waited one cycle anyway, because I wanted to be sure I had healed physically and there was nothing left in my uterus. 

I think there's no medical reason to wait, if you feel ready mentally and physically. Even the ""wait one cycle"" recommendation is for dating purposes mostly. After my 2nd loss (6 weeks) I had to wait one cycle, because there was a piece of placenta in my uterus that was risk of infection if I were to get pregnant (it passed naturally before my period even came). 

From my experiences, I'd recommend at least get a checkup in 2-3 weeks and ultrasound to clear that you've healed, before you try. One cycle is not going to make a difference. But I do recognise the wanting to be pregnant as soon as possible.

With my living firstborn (who will turn 3 soon, so this was a while ago), I was in a situation where a close friend of ours, K, who was having fertility issues basically ghosted us (and never repaired the relationship -- she has since adopted a little one from foster care and is pregnant from IVF, which I found out from mutual friends), and I was resentful of the ghosting.

If you want to repair the relationship, include something about how you're very happy for her (even if you currently are not, you will be later) and you just need a little time to heal. Keep the tone of your email as neutral as possible -- where possible, give them the benefit of the doubt even though it hurts.

Well, on Wednesday, we’re going to have a family meeting for SIL and BIL to discuss how upset they are that I wasn’t there for them more during SIL’s pregnancy. I had success and a loss during her pregnancy, and apparently she’s been mad at me since my loss since I haven’t had a lot to do with them. Mind you, we’ve been social distancing since March, and I’ve asked many times how she was feeling, if she needed something from the store, etc. I made her blankets and went to her shower, which my MIL insisted I do. I have made clothes for her. 

The day she was induced, I was a mess. I didn’t think I would be and it sort of blindsided me. I spent a lot of the day distracting myself and checking our group message (with SIL, my husband, and MIL in this group) because SIL was updating everyone in it. Apparently I was supposed to either call/message her personally and congratulate her and wish her luck, because she cut me off from all updates, didn’t tell us when our nephew was born, and hasn’t spoken to me since. She believes I’ve been completely out of order the whole time and I’ve ‘abandoned’ her, even though I’ve explained several times that this isn’t a slight against her; I’m in pain, and I feel that i haven’t been given time to actually grieve. I also found out after my loss that the next time I have success, I’ll have to take blood thinner shots and probably progesterone supplements, and my chances of success are affected, so I’ve been mourning the fact I may not he able to have biological children. 

I don’t know of any other way to explain to them how awful the whole experience was for me; SIL had a loss a decade or so ago, as a young woman, but she had a D&C the day after she found out the baby had passed while I had to take cytotec, go through THAT hell at home, then take another dose and have a D&C to remove all POC. It took over a month, from the day I found out. All she cares about is that I wasn’t supportive for her.",[],,t1_fr1s3x8,False,0,[],False,"<div class=""md""><p>TW: mention of LC/success</p>

I'll keep you in my thoughts today. 

When I had my MMC (4/4/20) I bled for almost a week and spotted for another and I took pregnancy tests hoping the HCG would go down. Apparently the LH tests can pick up on HCG. Once my HPT came up negative I switched to LH strips. My LH was reading high but it may have been picking up on trace amounts of HCG? Who knows. It was weird. I had high LH for a week. 

My experience was I ovulated around CD18 from the day of my medical MC. That's not a normal day for me but hey it wasn't a normal cycle. Anyway, the cycle I am on now (cycle after the MC) I ovulated on a normal day (CD 12/13) and my LH peaked around 3.18 (using the premom app to compare/analyze). 

Honestly just keep monitoring the LH. It sounds like you may still have some spotting. For me the spotting drove me crazy. C R A Z Y. Just hang in there. It does go away. 5 weeks after my MC I had a follow up with my doctor and I happened to be on my period then. Came the day before my appointment on a Sunday. So I will say that your cycle may be unpredictable. I wouldn't have scheduled an appointment when I was expecting AF. 🤷🏻‍♀️ 

Anyway, I would say if you get to 5 weeks out and still in limbo just check in with your doc and let them know where you are at.

We inexplicably lost our daughter at 22 weeks due to preterm labor. We were sexually intimate (no penetration) about 3.5 weeks out.

I notice it's sometimes easier for him not to see my pain, because that is what hurts him the most. So sometimes I need to remind him that I'm not ok, that I need a hug, a conversation, or just some attention. 

I find it helps to just put it bluntly but gentle: ""[SO], I'm sad, (it's mothersday), I need you.""

A scan at 22 weeks confirmed other major abnormalities (NT size, not swallowing and small amount of fluid) but the amnio came back with no issues, so it was all based on scans. We decided to terminate but it was a very difficult decision as we had no syndrome to point to.</p>

<p>We have been speaking with a genetic counsellor - we got exome sequence done, which was difficult to interpret as no known syndromes identified, but it is also good to know for future pregnancies, as there weren’t any issues identified.

She was concerned with whether I'd had a negative pregnancy test since the miscarriage, to ensure it was complete. I had but it would be useful to be able to report dates of tests etc when you speak to yours.

She said basically there is nothing I should do differently next time except let her know asap. If I do have a 3rd and need a referral to the recurrent miscarriage service she said there are a lot of blood tests etc she can do to get the ball rolling while I wait.

I have done the exact same thing. I think it’s ok to dream a little :-) I try to remind to remind myself that it’s only a possibility so I don’t get too attached to the idea that everything works out perfectly.

Why do you take progesterone supplements? Were your levels checked or is it „just in case“?

<p>I&#39;ve thought about having my partner pick up a test every day this week, and keep deciding against it figuring I&#39;m just getting my hopes up and imagining things. But this is the latest I&#39;ve ever been since I began tracking my periods. Will probably break down and get a test today and do that first thing tomorrow...</p>

Second. You may benefit from talking to your doctor about something like Zoloft as well as possibly talking to a counselor. Panic attacks suck. They’re debilitating. You deserve better than constant panic attacks! You are worth finding a way to reduce those. I take Zoloft myself for depression and anxiety and panic attacks. I also take hydroxyzine for sleep and acute panic attacks. You also have every right to be anxious and panicked.

<p>Second. You may benefit from talking to your doctor about something like Zoloft as well as possibly talking to a counselor. Panic attacks suck. They’re debilitating. You deserve better than constant panic attacks! You are worth finding a way to reduce those. I take Zoloft myself for depression and anxiety and panic attacks. I also take hydroxyzine for sleep and acute panic attacks. You also have every right to be anxious and panicked. Don’t let anybody tell you to just “calm down”, and if they do, pretty sure it’s okay to punch them. </p>

I was kind of in your shoes a few months ago (though I had already tried Letrozole when faced with this decision). I have lean PCOS. I had success conceiving #1 with Letrozole + TI July 2017. MMC at 7ish weeks February 2019 (unplanned, conceived naturally). This year I started seeing a RE to conceive #2 and the HSG showed I have a 1cm uterine septum. RE said 1cm is the cutoff for surgery/no surgery and it’s really up to me to decide if I want it removed. I decided to move forward with Letrozole + TI. Unfortunately, I had a CP in March. I decided once again to move forward with Letrozole + TI. 

I chose the no surgery route partly because I’m scared of surgery but mostly because I so desperately want to be pregnant and the surgery would delay the process by at least 2 cycles (there’s a long surgery backlog right now due to COVID). 

Two things I’d consider if you haven’t already - the size of the septum and emotional toll if you do have another loss.

You are well within your right to not want to talk about it however. If I were you, depending on the relationship, you could text before hand and explain that your still grieving and would like to enjoy the day, so despite being grateful for her concern, could she please avoid the topic. OR on the day, if it comes up, just politely say “I’m still very much hurting, is rather not talk about it at the moment, but thanks for your concern”.
For me I’d text ahead, so that’s I didn’t have the anxiety of “will it come up? What will I say exactly”, but that depends on your relationship and how you’d rather deal with it.

Her response was “sometimes when we end a wanted pregnancy the area can feel more painful even though nothing is wrong”</p>

<p>Hmmmm this is a woman saying that! I expect it from a man but not a woman. Anyway, she said risk of retained products and ashermans is basically zero because they use ultrasound to check to make sure nothing is left behind and no sharp objects are used. </p>

<p>She did offer for me to come in for an exam. I will likely take it. I just don’t know what she will do or say. </p>

<p>Sorry for the rant, I just can’t believe that she blamed my emotions for uterine pain and cramping.</p>

My loss was 4 weeks and 2 days ago. I gave birth vaginally at 22+2.

I think my period might have returned...? It's so hard to know for sure. Google says it can take 6-8 weeks (or more) for your period to return after childbirth, but that really only addresses people who give birth full-term. There's no info out there for people like me.

My bleeding was tapering off to spotting/mucousy discharge with a couple days of nothing at all. Then on Tuesday, I noticed a few spots of red when I wiped. Yesterday there was consistent red blood when I wiped and transferring to the pantyliner, but I didn't need a full pad. So the bleeding is there, but not heavy. When I pee, I see bits of tissue in the toilet: also my normal for a period.  I don't know if the increased bleeding is because I started adding in yoga on Tuesday and have picked up my walking, though. I noticed early on, that my bleeding would increase if I stood or walked a lot, but that hasn't really been the case in at least a week.

Before pregnancy, I had a 29-30 day cycle with spotting 3-5 days before getting AF. Then, I'd have heavy bleeding for 1-2 days, medium bleeding for 2ish days, and then light the rest of the time for a total of 4-5 days of bleeding. Now, who knows.  🤷🏼‍♀️

It looks like a period and feels like a period (mild cramps and bloating, which was normal for me), but I can't be sure about anything right now. We're going to wait to start trying again until I get at least two periods, so if this is the first, then we hopefully can start TTC at the end of next month.

I won’t go into detail but in hindsight I don’t think my body would’ve been ready that month and I wish we would’ve waited to try again until after that first cycle. To each their own though! Best of luck to you 💜</p>

<p>Medically, I&#39;m WTT until fertility clinics reopen (who knows when this will be). Mentally, I&#39;m WTT until I feel like I can handle it -- and with the grief I am still (ugh) carrying, and the pandemic, and the many feelings that I am feeling and/or trying not to feel about switching over to IVF, I have no idea how long I need. A week? A year? Never??? </p>

When we first agreed to start trying for a baby, I was nothing but excited.

It was the worst experience of my life but somehow, we got through that.

They don&#39;t do follow-up scans in the UK unless there seems to be a problem, so I just went privately - mainly for something to do really!  Hoping you&#39;re back to full health soon xx</p>
