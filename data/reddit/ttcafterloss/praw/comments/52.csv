First off I am so sorry. 

I lost twins at twenty weeks, and so my OB did tests as soon as possible and found I have Factor Five. So as soon as I became pregnant, we went on a double dose of lovenox .

I have no idea what her name was but I’m sure it’s on my medical records, and if I could have her perform the section, that would be my preference. We’ll figure it out. I’d also love if my L&D nurse could be there with me too— she was the head of the perinatal loss team and she was an amazing comfort to us that day.

Figured I should introduce myself! I am a mom who is wanting a second biological child. We have my stepson, who I like to call my ""bonus son"", and my bio son. I love my boys; they are great. Before my bio son we had 4 losses. I was active on this sub under a different username for ttc and my pregnancy with him. The ladies I was in the alumni thread at that time and I all got pretty close and some of us have even met in person. 

Anyways, 9 months after my son was born my cycles came back and we started loosely ttc. Because I was breastfeeding my cycles were a little wonky but we still conceived quickly. Unfortunately, that ended as an early loss. I went 6 cycles without conceiving and focused on getting in shape and learning to run. Once I went back to a maintenance diet I conceived again. At 7 weeks we had our first appointment and saw an empty sac. Bloodwork showed decreasing hcg. I opted for waiting it out as I have had so many losses that I try to limit interventions now. Passed everything at 9 weeks. I went very smoothly as I start taking pain killers on a schedule alternating a half dose of the narcotic pain killer and etxra stregnth ibuprofen the second my cramps start ramping up.  

We were devestated and finally ran RPL testing. Everything came back clear so I started on progesterone in my luteal phase and conceived again. This pregnancy had average hcg levels that were doubling appropriately. Empty sac discovered at 6 week scan. Hcg barely rising, follow up confirms blighted ovum. Got a D&C to test tissue. Female trisomy 16. We make appointments with 2 Reproductive Endocrinologists for a first and second opinion.

The first doctor recommends  continue trying naturally or IVF. Gives futyre pregnancies bleak odds (1 in 10 chance of success which is just totally false after further research) and says we should anticipate multicle egg retrivals to get enough embryos to test. I'm devestated. We cannot afford multiple cycles. Open Enrollment reveals new fertility coverage through my husband's employer which includes all medications, 3 cycles, cryo preservation fees, pgs, just everything. We anticipate meeting with the second doctor to start a conversation about IVF and move forward with that. 

Two weeks before my second opinion I read a book called ""Unbroken"". It is by a Reproductive Endocrinologist and it breaks down the facts we know about recurrent pregnancy loss and what is still unknown. The book gives me a renewed sense of hope. My husband and I decide to try on our own for awhile. I still meet with the second doctor. She had tons of different tests she thought we could still run. She gave me a transvaginal ultrasound and discovered a small septum and thin lining. I had recently ovulated. I left the appointment with instructions to call on cycle day 1 to schedule a hysteroscopy.  Well, cycle day 1 never came. 

I am 8 weeks today with nothing but reassuring tests and ultrasounds. We have seen the heartbeat twice and I have been the sickest I have been out of any pregnancy. My mantra this pregnancy is: Meditate and let go. I'm trying to stay positive, avoid ruminating, and remain in the present. I've just been so miserable the past 6 months with those back to back Blighted Ovums that I need to feel something else for once. So far it is mostly working. I still have moments of panic, like after a recent spotting scare, but overall I am feeling pretty positive.

<p>Be careful though, Nala, I don’t think this will be the last time she mentions it. Find a supportive friend or family member you can talk to about this if you can, it really does help.  I’m so sorry for the loss of your daughter, and sending you lots of baby-making luck!</p>

- iZombie. I've only watched the first episode, but it was fun and I've heard the quality continues.

- The Marvelous Mrs Maisel. Haven't seen this at all, but it's on my list and is apparently hilarious.

- Glee. Caveat that there are, I think, at least two major pregnancy plot lines, both pretty early in the show. I was nowhere near TTC when I watched the first several seasons so I'm not sure what I would think of them now. Mostly, it's just a goofy show about teenagers and pop music.

- Supernatural. I got sucked into this show real hard. It starts off a little spooky, but the two main characters just really grew on me over time.

- The Good Place. I've only seen about four episodes so far, but it's fun and pretty light.

<li><p>Glee. Caveat that there are, I think, at least two major pregnancy plot lines, both pretty early in the show. I was nowhere near TTC when I watched the first several seasons so I&#39;m not sure what I would think of them now. Mostly, it&#39;s just a goofy show about teenagers and pop music.</p></li>
<li><p>Supernatural. I got sucked into this show real hard. It starts off a little spooky, but the two main characters just really grew on me over time.</p></li>
<li><p>The Good Place. I&#39;ve only seen about four episodes so far, but it&#39;s fun and pretty light.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>I dunno if you&#39;re into sci-fi shows, but Travelers, Person of Interest, and Dark Matter are three that I&#39;ve marathoned recently and really enjoyed. </p>

<p>Food shows: Top Chef, The Great British Baking Show, The Big Family Cooking Showdown, Zumbo&#39;s Just Desserts.</p>

Other life goals had to be set on the back burner for my husband and I after our loss--nothing else seemed to matter much in light of the sorrow we felt.

Our first month we were mostly in shock, the first week or so I was still dealing with the physical effects of pregnancy as I was further along when we miscarried, so my husband was focused mostly on taking care of me, rather than on his feelings. He did a lot of holding me while I sobbed and validating my feelings, assuring me that he felt the same way about missing our lost little ones.

My main piece of advice would be to ensure you're not seeking all or even most of your support from one another. Support for men is difficult to find, though my husband has found it in coworkers and friends/family.

I've been feeling pretty good but last night was one year since the first twin died. The second one passed sometime between January 7 and January 10 and then they were born January 12. I just feel weird about it all.

I've had this month built up in my head for so long. But up until yesterday I wasn't really thinking about it much.  Life has been busy and good and I don't know. I thought I'd want to go through the box of their little things from the hospital and reread my journal and sort of relive it all. But I just don't feel like it. Do you think this is avoidance? Should I make myself spend some time thinking about it?

I had a therapy appointment I had to cancel due to snow. I rescheduled for next week so I'll get to talk about it then. I don't know. I just would rather focus on all the good things in my life right now. They're not forgotten. But I don't know.

<p>I&#39;ve been feeling pretty good but last night was one year since the first twin died. The second one passed sometime between January 7 and January 10 and then they were born January 12. I just feel weird about it all.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve had this month built up in my head for so long. But up until yesterday I wasn&#39;t really thinking about it much.  Life has been busy and good and I don&#39;t know. I thought I&#39;d want to go through the box of their little things from the hospital and reread my journal and sort of relive it all. But I just don&#39;t feel like it. Do you think this is avoidance? Should I make myself spend some time thinking about it?</p>

<p>I had a therapy appointment I had to cancel due to snow. I rescheduled for next week so I&#39;ll get to talk about it then. I don&#39;t know. I just would rather focus on all the good things in my life right now. They&#39;re not forgotten. But I don&#39;t know. </p>

I’m in a similar boat right now (they caught my ectopic on the 3rd). I hope you don’t mind me adding my symptoms here as well.

I had brown spotting starting on Dec 15th, it looked almost identical to implantation bleeding I’d expirenced before. I tested positive 5 days later. I kept spotting.

 A little over a week later I felt burning pain on my left side but also along my bikini line. I went to the ER in the wee hours of Christmas Day and they found nothing. It was too early. I was diagnosed with “bleeding in pregnancy”.

The pain stopped. I only had regular pregnancy symptoms and bleeding up until my second early ultrasound Jan 3rd. My HCG levels more than doubled in 48hrs. From the outside things would have looked normal. I have a history of miscarriage, that combined with the bleeding got me an early scan.

A few weeks back I had talked about how I was having a hard time getting a maternal mental health referral. My (now ex) midwife hadn't done it all three times that I had asked her, so I had gone to my GP to get the referral. I was happy with how that appointment had gone, and was confident she would sent it through. 

Welp. She never did. I logged into my health portal and she also got 60% of her notes TOTALLY WRONG, even though she was typing them while I was sitting right there. 

I'm not sure if this is a global standard, but in NZ you can take a test for pre or post natal depression called the Edinburgh Post Natal Depression scale. I was asked to do it and I scored 22, which is very high. I told her all the anxiety I was having, disconnection with the pregnancy, lack of sleep, out of character panic attacks etc.  Still, no referral. 

I would pay for this service, but no one in this region specialised in Maternal Mental Health like the publicly funded guys at the hospital. 

I had a good chat with the Maternal Mental Health coordinator, even though she officially can't help me yet, she helped rush a referral from my new OB who did it the very second I asked. 

I am that annoying person who lodges a complaint with the health board for anything I think is dangerous or wrong, and ever since I moved to this region in 2014, I have had to complain about every single interaction I have had with the public health system. I feel like I'm crazy. But imagine all the people out there getting this treatment and just accepting it because they feel like they have  no choice. It's like a fight to get the basics here, and the only person who is treating me like I'm not a faceless bag of flesh with my OB who I am paying STUPID amounts of money for.

It's a natural feeling and it's mixed up with all the grief of losing a baby and all the anxiety of wondering what the future will bring.

I think the most important thing is to handle these feelings in a way that makes your marriage stronger. It is so hard to sacrifice for our spouses when we are hurting ourselves, but they are hurting too. Can you think of anything that would help your husband feel a little better? Maybe a favorite meal or a massage or his favorite flavor of ice cream? Sometimes a small gesture conveys a lot of care.

For my husband and I, we've noticed that those little caring gestures make us feel more in love. Feeling more in love makes sex more appealing too. Obviously it's not instant and you can't go into it thinking that you'll have sex in exchange for his favorite icecream, but I do think it's easier to transition into ""making love"" when you're both in a loving mood to begin with. 

We've also found it helpful to focus on sex as a comfort, way to relieve stress, laugh together, etc, rather than as a way to conceive. We need all the feel-good hormones we can get after seven miscarriages. Even 5 minutes of distraction and relief from grief is welcome. It also really helps us feel closer (thank you hormones!), which makes it easier to overlook irritation.

I hope I'm not making this sound easy! Just wanted to share a couple tactics we've learned the hard way :)

It's so tough and I'm sorry your work hasn't been the best at supporting you through it.

I just returned to work yesterday after my stillbirth in June last year. I'm in the UK, so I was entitled to maternity pay/time off for a year. 

I ended up taking 4 months of maternity pay at full salary, then I switched to sick pay at full salary for the remaining time. I'm doing a phased return to work, so I'm starting out doing 4-5 hours a day and building the time up for the next 6 weeks. I'm on full salary at this point too and my wage is being made up from sick pay (my company offers a full year at full salary).

From the start I've been given a lot of support. My manager checked in on me via email every so often and updated me on changes in the business (I told her I wanted to be kept in the loop). I ended up telling my manager all the details (right down to my son missing patches of skin and me needing stitches when he was born...) because it felt right to really explain how horrible and traumatised I felt.

Work also pays for an income protection scheme and I've been having monthly chats with a lovely woman from that about what work could do to support me in my absence/how to handle my return to work. 

I was always invited to all social events at work (Christmas party/meal and any other times the team was going out together), which made it easier because I could talk about what happened with my team in a social environment before coming back. That's meant I've been completely comfortable with my team because they see they can talk to me normally and most of the time I'm not a crying mess.

I mentioned that I'd been to see a counsellor and work have paid for all those sessions so I didn't have any extra financial worries.

We had a plan in place for when I returned and I was told that it's completely flexible and I can lead the way/change the plan as I see fit. So far I've been catching up on emails (all 1400 of them which I just ended up deleting...) and any training I've missed. 

I had one encounter with someone who really pissed me off (she was pretty much interrogating me and being really insensitive) and I had a meltdown. My manager offered to send an email to the department advising that I'm happy to talk to people and be approached, but using some sensitivity/tact with regards to the details would be good because I may or may not be happy to talk about everything. I took her up on that because I'm fairly sure a lot of people won't have a clue how to behave around me. 

I consider myself so lucky they've been able to put this support in place for me. I work in private health insurance (it's nothing like insurance in the US) and as a whole there's a lot of compassion in my workplace. Plus a whole lot of focus on staff health and well-being. 

Overall I think communication is key. I know not everyone will be lucky enough to have the financial support and the options to work reduced hours etc, but discussing how work can best support what you might need will hopefully help.

I'm new here. I followed/read the posts in the TTCafterloss community off and on during the course of my three MCs and never posted. Now, I just got a positive result on Monday and I'm feeling the need to connect because I am petrified. I hope you have it in your heart to welcome a former lurker... 

Here's a little about my journey. In 2010, I was diagnosed with a complete vaginal and uterine septum, way before TTC was even a thought in my mind. I waiting until April 2015 to have my resection surgery and went to one of the best doctors for the procedure. I became pregnant in July 2016 and had my first loss the next month, in August, at 9 weeks 1 day -- while on vacation on a mediterranean cruise. It's a crazy long story that includes a trip on a medical airplane, an emergency D&C, blood transfusion and more. 

I then got my second positive in November 2016 and my second miscarriage the next month at 9 weeks 4 days, requiring a D&E. Testing for the second loss came back normal, so I had a complete RPL panel done and they found nothing wrong. So I went in for a hysteroscopy with my original surgeon, who removed some residual septum, retained placental tissue, and some polyps. After that, I went for a second opinion and after further extensive testing, was given the all clear. 

I then got pregnant for the third time in August 2017 and pretty much immediately started bleeding. I miscarried at home over the course of a week. My doctors and I agree that the third loss was most likely a chromosomal abnormality, but I underwent further imaging of my uterus which reveals there was STILL significant septum at the top of my uterus. So I went to a world renowned specialist in Boston who has this crazy surgical technique and got that removed. I say crazy because it took 5 minutes and I was fully awake for it - no anesthesia or pain meds. My husband and I watched on a screen while he snipped away it my uterus. 

Now, here I am. Pregnancy again (barely - 4 weeks and a few days) and extremely anxious. If this one doesn't stick, we are moving on to IVF - though I'm not sure how much that would help me. I have lots of questions I'd like to ask but I don't want to be too greedy since I'm a first time poster...  ",[],,t1_ds6cucz,False,0,[],False,"<div class=""md""><p>Hi! I&#39;m new here.

1) Explain to them what you went through. Strange as it is, a lot of women don’t understand the particular brand of horror us 16-25 week losses experience. People dismiss what we went through all the time because they have no concept of what happened. They tend to think we simply “passed some tissue” without realizing we gave birth only to turn around and bury our children. Make it a point they know you went through childbirth then immediately had to plan a funeral, then had to go to the funeral and of course theres the getting birth certificates with deceased stamped all over on them. 

2) There needs to be a means of communication between you and your manager when you are really struggling. I suggest a codeword if you want to keep it from coworkers being aware that you say when you need alone time. 

3) Write down your triggers for them. Mine tend to be any babies or twins, while my husbands was talking about our girls specifically. That way if it comes up in conversation, they can help steer the conversation on a new topic or will be aware why you excuse yourself. 

4) Office events like baby showers or announcements are very harrowing. I think management could be proactive and tell you ahead of time if they are aware to the point of letting you opting out. If you know in advance, you can always send a nice card with a gift card that shows you care. It will go a long way relationship wise with co workers as well. 

5) I don’t know how big or how feasible this is for your office, but perhaps a small meeting after your loss with your closest coworkers (if you were comfortable with it) telling them what happened, and going over the big things NOT to say to you when you came back.

In the last chart, the shift is on day 26, and the highest in the pre-shift six is on day 20 at 97.9. We would expect the temperature to rise above 98.3, but it never quite gets there.

But I just didn&#39;t feel like talking about any of this, and if I tell them, they&#39;ll be respectful but I know my mom will ask how I&#39;m feeling, how things are going, etc. etc. It comes from a good place but I just don&#39;t want to do it. And they&#39;re heading out of town next week, so I probably won&#39;t tell them until they&#39;re back, unless everything falls apart before they leave. So it all just feels a little bit off, but it&#39;s how MH wants to do it and like I said, I don&#39;t want to deal with the alternative. So mostly I&#39;m just trying not to focus on the fact that right now, I&#39;m pregnant.</p>

They got pregnant again and I was genuinely happy for them. My husband and I would talk about how they were so deserving and kind. We stopped texting with the couple months ago but would still “like” stuff on FB.

Until today. When she announced the birth. And named their daughter Vienna.

Idk. I cried. I was mad. I was sad. I felt betrayed. I don’t own the name but it felt so personal. It’s not like they spoke to us about it or even gave us a heads up. Idk guys.

Acknowledge that you know that her feelings will be complicated, and that it&#39;s okay that she may want to do things (like meet the baby or go to a baby shower) at her own pace and in her own terms - or even not at all. I think you also can acknowledge that you share some empathy, since you had a MC yourself, but understand that you realize that her experience was particularly traumatic. I also might ask her if there is anything else that would make this easier for her, like perhaps giving her advance notice if you do post a pregnancy announcement on Facebook. </p>

It’s much more expensive, so it’s probably dumb to use it when not TTC, but a little bit goes a long way and I found the difference in feel to justify the cost, so I say go for it! </p>

(Don’t bring lasagna. Everyone brings lasagna, and no one likes lasagna that much. We still have three of them in our freezer from May.)

If she has any living children at home already, caring for them will be an especially big struggle. Offering to babysit, taking them out for lunch at a restaurant with a play area so they get worn out, etc, are all good. One of the most helpful things people did for us was send a few new toys and books so my toddler could entertain herself with something new while we sat catatonically on the couch. If she has no living children, disregard this advice.

Having people come do our laundry and even doing simple things like sweeping our floor or vacuuming so we didn’t have to was a big help. 

One thing I really liked was, after the freezer meals stopped coming, we signed up for Blue Apron. By that point, I felt functional enough to do SOMETHING but not functional enough to do things like menu plan or grocery shop. Having ingredients delivered directly to my door with stepwise instructions was such a godsend. For an hour a few times a week, I could just mindlessly follow the instructions and at the end of that hour, I had actually produced something. It was such a small thing, but it actually was the first step I took to feeling just a bit more human. I’d ask her in a few weeks if that’s something she’d be interested in and then spread the word that gift cards to a meal kit service would be welcomed.

As far as talking, unless you guys are especially close, I wouldn’t expect her to be very forthcoming. But do let her know that you are there for her, and let her know that anything she tells you will be kept absolutely confidential and listened to without judgement. This was huge for me, because the people I opened up to basically only heard about my desperation to be pregnant. I couldn’t have shared that with them if I thought they would be judgmental about that or if I felt they’d go tell someone else, who probably WOULD be judgmental.  (Also want to take a second to emphasize just how normal it is for a person to immediately desire a new pregnancy after a stillbirth— I don’t know anyone who has had one who didn’t feel this, even if they decided not to act on it. But it doesn’t FEEL normal, it feels crazy... so keep all that in mind.)

Finally, I have one cousin who did just the best thing. She never knew what to say, and truthfully there were no words that could have helped so usually when people tried, it annoyed me. But anytime she was thinking of me, she’d just send me a string of heart emojis. I knew what it meant, no words had to be exchanged, and it bouyed me to know she was thinking of me. Usually, when I received it, I would take it as a prompt to tell her how that day was going for me, if I felt up to it. So you could consider that kind of outreach when words fail to communicate.

BPN!!!!

Still no period so far. Normally I got my period 2 weeks after ovulation so maybe maybe there is tiny tiny hope i might still get a BFP since I ovulated in the 20th - 22nd but I know it’s not likely.

I had my appendix out in December and one of the medicines said it makes it hard to get pregnant on (voltaren). But my boobs are aching a lot but could just be crazy hormones. 

Guess I have to wear a pad all week just Incase AF arrives without notice 

Edit: AF so graciously showed up just now ;(. Fuck another month gone. When I told my husband I got my period he was just quiet and went to work. It’s seriously starting to affect us now. 

I have an appointment with the gyno to book IVF but it will take at least over 1.5 years to get it public. In all of this I wish we never had a wedding, that money could have been for private IVF. 

I feel super down now. It’s my second period since misscarriage but the first happened at the exact time of my appendix so I could say maybe that caused it.

None of that changed when I lost my baby, it only intensified because every cell in my body was prepared to care for a baby and wasn’t doing that.

Definitions are always kind of tricky to me - I had one blighted ovum, so that's probably classified more like a chemical pregnancy because only the sac continued to develop long enough to visualize. The other two losses were around 6 weeks, so in theory they *might* have been visible on US before I miscarried, but they might also have ended prior to that and I just didn't pass them until later. I didn't get a chance to make it to an appointment before I started bleeding with either of those, so US was inconclusive I guess. It did show thickened uterine lining. So do I consider those chemical or clinical? Plus, we had a live birth in between the 2nd and 3rd loss, so by that definition I don't have RPL. But I think that any definition that relies on chance order is flawed. Maybe repeat losses with zero live births vs. repeat losses with 1+ live birth should be different types. Maybe type Ia and Ib and type II or something.

I also think that diagnosis of an underlying pathology has an aspect that wasn't really addressed. Beyond just issues that are ""currently not yet identified by routine clinical investigations,"" you have the issue of pathologies that aren't (yet) understood, or are too rare to be part of routine investigations. But if there are 100 different pathologies that each effect .25% of RPL patients, that's a solid 25% of patients that have a true issue but will likely never detect it because .25% is probably not high enough to test everyone. Or, if it's just a rare issue, there might not be enough evidence for how it affects pregnancies. I have two possible pathologies, but neither one is understood enough to know whether or how they might affect us. So how many people might appear to be type I but really could be investigated further as type II?

So do I assume that I probably fall into the type I group, although I'd like to think there's really a cause beyond bad luck, or do I assume that despite evidence that I might fall into the type I group, maybe I'm really type II? I don't know. I know that three losses isn't ""normal.""

After my full term stillbirth, I was told to wait one cycle before trying again. (Also, obviously was told not to have sex for six weeks, which was easy in my case since I was still recovering from an 8lb baby and had a lot of stitches.) I was told that for dating purposes it was best to not try until I got another period— so if you choose to try before you get your period back, I don’t think it’s a medical issue, just a dating issue. (Being aware of when you are ovulating can help mitigate this— you would know when conception happened and can date the pregnancy from there.)

Just my own personal experience— my period returned 6 weeks to the day after delivery, so we started trying again after bleeding stopped. But I am 100% sure I did not ovulate prior to that period, so don’t be surprised if your cycles are strange for a bit as your hormones settle down. My period came when my HCG must have dropped to 0, and then I ovulated normally (CD21, give or take a day) for the three following cycles. But my luteal phases were a week long, or even less. This, I was told, was normal following pregnancy, as the body takes up to six months to begin producing hormones in equilibrium again. 

(FWIW, I visited an RE with my midwife’s blessing after 3 short luteal phases. I was going crazy, there was no way I was going to wait six cycles to have a shot to reasonably conceive again. So I completely understand where you are coming from in your desire to try again right away. Progesterone supplementation sorted my cycles out immediately, after the RE ruled out any other factors that could be contributing to hormone imbalance.)

Also, I saw above that your timing issues may be down to work trips. I wanted to mention that your cycle may be very different than you expect following such a late loss, so don’t be shocked if you ovulate at a different time than you are expecting— it may be that you get lucky and happen to ovulate when traveling isn’t a factor— I’ll keep my fingers crossed for you that this is the case, but overall, I completely understand your desire to try again ASAP and also to at least have a shot at a pregnancy prior to your first due date.

From what I understand, temperatures just fluctuate— so that in and of itself is nothing to worry hugely about, but what you are looking for is temps that stay above the coverline during the luteal phase. Some of yours do, some don’t. (An occasional weird temp dip below the coverline then shoots back up is probably within the realm of normal, but you have quite a few that go to or below the coverline.)

Without being any kind of expert, I feel like it’s a safe guess that low progesterone is the culprit for both your short luteal phases (I know 10 days is “fine” but most people would want to see at least 12 to give more time for a fertilized egg to implant) and your erratic temps.

My own personal experience (TW:LC) includes some very short luteal phases. When I conceived my second child, I was still nursing my first and that was interfering with my progesterone production. My luteal phases were around 9 days when we stopped preventing pregnancy, thinking it would take a few months still for them to lengthen out. I somehow weirdly got pregnant that month— my guess is that the implantation happened early enough (I had some spotting around 7dpo that I later chalked up to implantation bleeding) that the HGC began emitting signals to the corpus luteum to keep producing progesterone. I feel like it was a lucky fluke, except for that baby was stillborn. (Unrelated to his conception, of course.) So it is possible to conceive with short luteal phases, but my charts at the time didn’t include the large temperature dips.

After my stillbirth, my period arrived 6 weeks postpartum and I ovulated normally— around CD21 (I’ve always had longer-than-average cycles, but they’ve been reliably in the 35 day range). My luteal phases were SUPER short though. Like, 5 days. At first I was told that was normal after a full term delivery. But my cycles kept repeating this without much improvement. I visited an RE and after ruling out other issues, he also concluded that I had low progesterone but everything else was normal.  

My treatment plan basically was to begin using progesterone suppositories vaginally after ovulation. I don’t think you need an RE involved in your care for this treatment— you should be able to talk to your OB (bring your charts) and see if they think they’d be right for you. You are obviously good at identifying when you ovulate, and most people start using them about 3dpo— when their temps have been up long enough to confirm ovulation. I used mine twice a day, 12 hours apart. The only real downside to these is that they are messy— you need a panty liner. I wound up conceiving the first cycle I used them, so I kept taking them throughout the first trimester. But I believe that if I hadn’t fallen pregnant, I would have taken them for about two weeks and then stopped and my period should have arrived within a couple of days. 

I hope this was helpful, and I hope your doctor is willing to consider it (a doctor friend recently told me that they have no real idea why luteal phase defect happens so they have no real idea how to treat it— my impression is that progesterone supplementation is the best guess doctors have but by no means a silver bullet, so some won’t consider it) and I hope that it solves some of your problems!

And since my question deals with a positive pregnancy test, I didn't want to post it somewhere that could upset someone, which is why I am posting in here. Also I should note I have a living 1 year old son. Please let me know if I'm violating any rules or if there is somewhere better I could post this. 

I had a miscarriage beginning November 3rd, I was 7 weeks pregnant. My hcg levels were down to 5 as of November 17th, so my OB said I didn't need to come back for any additional blood tests as that was essentially the same as not being pregnant (I'm not super familiar with hcg level numbers and what they mean). 

My husband and I were NTNP when I conceived that baby, but the miscarriage was so taxing emotionally and physcially I wanted to put off even the possibility of conceiving again, so we used condoms until I got another period.

My period started on December 3rd. I tracked my cycles when trying to conceive my son (which took 15 cycles) and I tended to ovulate around day 15-16, so on December 13th which was CD 11, I took an ovulation test and it was very negative, the second line was VERY faint. So, I somewhat foolishly I guess rolled the dice and told my husband we didn't need to use protection. We had unprotected sex again the next day as well, on CD 12. Since then we've used condoms. Of course I knew pregnancy was a possibility, and I guess I was feeling like if it happened under these circumstances it'd be a miracle or a sign or something. 

So, of course you know where this is going... for some reason I just had a feeling and I took a pregnancy test this morning and it was very positive. Not a squinter, for SURE positive. My period is not even late, though, it's not due for another 2-3 days, I am on CD 26 now. So, I'm just incredulous that this is happening and that the test was SO positive. 

So, my question is: is it at all possible that this is still left over HCG from my previous pregnancy that I lost? Or since it has been nearly 2 months and I've had a period in between, is that not possible? I am in complete denial that this is real, we want a second child so if it is it will be a welcomed surprise, it just seems so unlikely to me given the timing and the negative OPK test. Any advice is welcomed.

<p>I don’t know what your partner’s perspective on this is, but speaking as a fellow woman, I didn’t really understand this kind of pain until I went through it myself. I wrote it off as the kind of thing that just happens because nature does things like this. Of course, in your case your partner has also lost the hope and expectation of the children that would have been added to your family with each of these losses, so naturally there is an impact for her but perhaps it really is different when you don’t experience it bodily? </p>

TW:LC - When I gave birth to my living son, I had a rough go of it. Five days of induction and I was pleading for a c-section. The on call OB was incredibly rude to me and very aggressively anti the idea of me having one. As it turns out I had a 24 hour break and went into labour by myself but I have always remembered that doctor pretty unpleasantly. 

So I walk into the OB I agreed to meet with today to see if he could be my lead maternity carer, and it was him. I decided to broach the issue from the outset and said that I didn't like his bedside manner at the time, and the outcome of my labour has left me PETRIFIED about this time around. He was so great, he gave me a genuine apology and by the end of the appointment I was really pleased with his answers to my questions so we signed up. In an hour he had already done more for us than the midwife did over six weeks, so I'm really happy. 

We discussed the c-section issue and he is happy for me to have a c-section over an induction, and I'm happy to proceed with a vaginal birth as long as it happens spontaneously. I know it's early to be discussing it but I needed that reassurance to lessen a bit of worry. In NZ c-sections are not a choice, a doctor needs to have a reason for one, and he said trauma is a good enough reason. 

We also got another quick scan which was nice and everything looked good. 

So I feel like a bit of a weight has been lifted. 

Nausea has lifted a bit which is SO unusual for me. Both of my pregnancies before this have been hyperemesis until the minute I gave birth, but this hasn't been too bad. Quite bad sciatica thought but I'm dealing with it. 

Anyway, long update. Feeling pleased that a bit of mental pressure has been lifted. I'm also really proud of myself for being assertive with the doctor as I usually avoid confrontation. My husband said I was confident without being aggressive so I'm feeling really good about that. ",[],,t1_drt979e,False,0,[],False,"<div class=""md""><p>13+2 today.

We wound up having a really great, relaxing trip and were able to do a traditional Jewish Christmas yesterday— saw a movie and went out for Chinese food. (My husband is half Jewish and though he grew up celebrating Christmas, ever since we got married we’ve kind of made it a point to eat Chinese food on or around Christmas Day, especially in the first few years when we weren’t living near family and weren’t always home on Christmas.) 

We returned home today, and for our three year old’s sake, it is “Christmas Eve.” Somehow, doing things on the wrong day takes a bit of the sting out of the baby missing from our holiday— it’s not the same thing everyone else in the world is doing so even though to my daughter it feels like Christmas, to us it just feels kind of like a silly game to make her believe it really is. So it’s been a busy day of baking and wrapping gifts and tonight we need to construct a play kitchen, and I also have some pretty grand ambitions (that will probably be dashed) of using all our empty boxes to build my beloved cat an amazing little kitty hideaway. (The nice thing is, he’s a cat. So if it doesn’t work out I can give him an empty box and he’ll be just as thrilled.)

On our drive home I started mentally trying to draft the email we intend to send to family letting them know I’m pregnant again. We have our 16 week anatomy scan next week and if that goes smoothly we’ll probably feel comfortable sharing sometime after that— though in my head for some reason I am envisioning 18 or so weeks— basically as long as I can make it before it becomes inevitable that we see one of our parents and cannot reasonably conceal it any longer. (Any minute now it’ll become pretty obvious, and we have plans to see at least my father in law in about three weeks.) So far, all I’ve really gotten is, “Dear Family,” and a vague sense that I should acknowledge that an email is an unorthodox way of conveying big news, but we recognize this news will bring about complicated emotions and we are so full of our own complicated emotions that absorbing anyone else’s right now isn’t something we’re up for.

My midwife has okayed Afrin nasal spray for nasal congestion and I finally caved with this cold and am using it to maintain my sanity and enable myself to breathe a bit.

I keep reminding myself that I barely needed it in the third trimester and he was completely fine until 39 weeks, but it’s the only thing I can truly remember doing differently between my pregnancy with my LC and my pregnancy with Sam. 

We are headed out of town today for a few days just to escape home during what should have been Baby’s First Christmas.

I had an HSG back in January, and it was definitely uncomfortable, but also very manageable (I've never had a D&C or an IUD put in, so that was my first ""something going in the cervix"" moment, and it wasn't nearly as bad as I thought it would be). The only time it was actually a bit painful for me was the moment when they were shooting the actual dye in, but it only lasted for less than a minute. (ETA: My tubes were clear, so there wasn't much pain - I have heard it can be considerably more painful if there's a blockage, which hopefully you won't have!) Then it was back to just the weird discomfort of having a catheter/tube and a speculum hanging out up there for a few minutes while they took the pictures. I wasn't in a tube or anything, they just had a machine they positioned over my mid-section (I was lying on a table covered with a gown and some paper blankets, so not cold or super-over-exposed, which was nice). The screen was next to my head, and it was actually kinda cool to see the dye work its way through my tubes, and to see the shape of my uterus (which turned out to be super-tilted... which wasn't the problem, but was still kinda interesting). If I remember correctly, the whole actual procedure itself took less than 15 minutes.

I took several ibuprofin as recommended by my RE about an hour before the test, and didn't have any pain afterwards and very little cramping - I actually drove myself to and from the test, which was about an hour away from home. My husband and I went to dinner and did some shopping that evening, and I was fine (but definitely wear a maxi pad, as some of the dye might continue to leak a bit).

I hope that helps! It really wasn't nearly as bad as I thought it would be. If you want to see some more stories, do a quick search over in r/stilltrying - lots of folks there have been through it, and many have done write-ups with varying levels of detail about how it went that might give you more info about what to expect.

I can't imagine going through multiple losses. My heart breaks for you. 

I'm going through this right now. I also had failed cytotec, and had to go through a D&C. Last week, 2 weeks after the D&C, pathology came back with a diagnosis of a partial molar pregnancy. If you end up needing a D&C, they'll want to confirm the partial molar pregnancy through pathology. 

Here's the rundown from my research/my doc: partial molar pregnancy usually occurs when two sperm fertilize one egg. This results in triploidy (three sets of chromosomes). The DNA of the sperm is what drives placental development, so with two sets of paternal DNA, placental development gets a little out of control and can get cystic/pre-malignant. An embryo/fetus may be seen with a partial molar pregnancy (we even saw a heartbeat at 7 weeks). A complete molar pregnancy occurs when a sperm fertilizes an egg with no maternal DNA and duplicates, so there's two sets of paternal DNA and no maternal DNA. No embryo/fetus develops, but an abnormal placenta will. 

With a partial molar pregnancy, there is an approximately 1-5% chance that, after evacuation through either natural or surgical means, there may be some pre-malignant placental cells that remain, invade into the uterine muscle, and either stay there, producing hCG, or form a tumor. This occurs in 10-20% of women with complete molar pregnancies. A partial molar pregnancy is also NOT associated with choriocarcinoma, although complete molar pregnancy is. 

To make sure you don't have pre-malignant placental cells hanging around, the doctor will follow your blood draw after the D&C to make sure they're dropping. During this time, you're not allowed to get pregnant. A new pregnancy will increase your levels of hCG and mask any potential growths. You can generally start trying again 3-6 months after your levels reach zero again. 

If your beta levels increase or plateau, they will diagnose you with an invasive mole and you may be put on a series of methotrexate shots, a kind of chemo (also used to end ectopic pregnancies) to help kill those cells. There is a near 100% cure rate, as it will be caught early and before any kind of metastasis transformation can occur.  If you have to have methotrexate shots, you won't be able to TTC until a year after you've completed the shots and your levels have returned to zero. 

What's helped me is knowing that worst case scenario is still totally manageable medically (i.e. it's not going to kill me), the worst case scenario isn't very likely (1-5%), and it won't have any effect on my fertility. However, being forced to wait to try again is heartbreaking. ",[],,t1_drmoamm,False,0,[],False,"<div class=""md""><p>Hey there...I&#39;m so sorry for your losses.

Unfollowed my friend on Insta and blocked her from Snapchat. The baby boy/newborn pics were an assault on my eyes and heart. I can't do it. Unfollowed her sis too who kept posting pics of baby. Just acn't. She probably won't notice as quickly that I'm not her Insta friend anymore as she will that I blocked her on Snap.I just can't deal with the 500 updates/pics/every single fart the baby has (she's the type to post EVERYTHING). Her second baby. 

She will usually send me a Hi on snap or common on one of my pics and will notice I am not even on her list anymore.

Had you told me a year ago I'd ever unfollow/have a strained relationship with my best friend, I'd never have believed you. My son dying was a gamechanger. She is my 8th friend to bring a baby home this year since March when my son died; 9 if you count my cousin. My little dude is the only who out of all of those who is buried in a grave. So unreal and unfair and I hate it.

I think the stats say it's 1 in 4 for loss. I'm 1 in 9 out of my friend/social circle. So hard.

This friend used to be my safe space/a place of comfort for me. She is now (since she told me she was preg) only a source of pain for me. It's such a major loss in my life cause we have always been so very close. I don't feel it anymore. I feel strained and like I don't even know her anymore (the former me is not the new me). I don't even think I will tell her I am pregnant this time. She doesn't feel safe to me or like someone I can be vulnerable with after how I felt she hurt me with her news so publicly, so coldly.

<p>Unfollowed my friend on Insta and blocked her from Snapchat. The baby boy/newborn pics were an assault on my eyes and heart. I can&#39;t do it. Unfollowed her sis too who kept posting pics of baby. Just acn&#39;t. She probably won&#39;t notice as quickly that I&#39;m not her Insta friend anymore as she will that I blocked her on Snap.I just can&#39;t deal with the 500 updates/pics/every single fart the baby has (she&#39;s the type to post EVERYTHING). Her second baby. </p>

<p>She will usually send me a Hi on snap or common on one of my pics and will notice I am not even on her list anymore.</p>

<p>Had you told me a year ago I&#39;d ever unfollow/have a strained relationship with my best friend, I&#39;d never have believed you. My son dying was a gamechanger. She is my 8th friend to bring a baby home this year since March when my son died; 9 if you count my cousin. My little dude is the only who out of all of those who is buried in a grave. So unreal and unfair and I hate it.</p>

<p>I think the stats say it&#39;s 1 in 4 for loss. I&#39;m 1 in 9 out of my friend/social circle. So hard.</p>

<p>This friend used to be my safe space/a place of comfort for me. She is now (since she told me she was preg) only a source of pain for me. It&#39;s such a major loss in my life cause we have always been so very close. I don&#39;t feel it anymore. I feel strained and like I don&#39;t even know her anymore (the former me is not the new me). I don&#39;t even think I will tell her I am pregnant this time. She doesn&#39;t feel safe to me or like someone I can be vulnerable with after how I felt she hurt me with her news so publicly, so coldly. Then to remind me/tell me she is in labor... right before Christmas... daggers in my heart.</p>

<p>I just want to know that this little baby comes home with me. </p>

I'm not temping, might look into that..

I'm trying to get back in shape, but it annoys me because it constantly reminds me why my body is out of shape in the first place. And it takes so long. I used to run long distances and do yoga but ever since I got pregnant I was strongly discouraged to because I had spottings in the first trimester.

I think it was you who suggested Insight Timer to me a couple of days/weeks ago :) I love it, I use it every day!

I haven't listened to the grief ones though, I didn't have the right time and space to do that.

Thank you for the book recommendation! I'll try to get it when I can. 

I've seen your tattoo before, it's really beautiful :) I totally get the links between physical and emotional state. I had zero pain when I was miscarrying and afterwards and I was very disappointed about it. That I was falling apart emotionally and I felt so good physically. It made no sense. 

Maybe you're right that control is all it's about. I generally have a hard time not having it, but this felt like my body was acting against me. And that it's been acting unpredictable for over a month now. Is this why I don't have any patience anymore? ",[],,t1_drmnvun,False,0,[],False,"<div class=""md""><p>(i love long posts) </p>

Hey guys! I’m just now posting my update bc things have been insane. My husband and I welcomed our son Vincent into the world on December 13 at 38 weeks 1 day. He weighed 6 lbs 13 oz and we are so in love with him. The afternoon of the 13th, my BP went up to 160/106 and we went to L&D for what we thought would just be monitoring. As soon as we got there, I started having strong and regular contractions (I had never had a single true contraction before that I could feel). My baby had also shifted position and was starting to become transverse. With all of those factors, we decided an urgent c section would be best. I was nervous at first but the c section and recovery were much easier than I thought. I’ll never forget the moment I heard him cry for the first time.

<p>I don&#39;t wanna do a big thing for Xmas this year and honestly - I think if anything I deserve to be selfish and stay at home and be lazy. My boyfriend is ok with it (he has said he will have to make an appearance at his family gathering but I don&#39;t have to), which is great...but I know I&#39;m gonna get a lot of crap from certain people on his side. And I&#39;m a person who likes to please everyone and hates to disappoint so I don&#39;t want to let anyone down but I&#39;m feeling a little selfish right now and literally do not care. I do not want to make an appearance for Christmas. </p>

<p>Also, I know my SIL will ask if I got a period yet (which I had) and then she will want to talk to me about how we should have sex like crazy and that she believes I&#39;ll get pregnant super soon (which could be the case but it&#39;s not up to me....it&#39;s up to my body. As someone who has 4 kids she should know that) do not want to deal with that. </p>

I feel as though my nausea is beginning to abate, yay! But my exhaustion is just as present as ever. My parents are passing through town today on their way to my sister’s house for Christmas and so I’m trying to straighten up the house a bit but I’m just so tired! 

I am just starting to show in a way that might make you wonder if it’s just Christmas cookies or if something is going on in there. I can still dress strategically in very loose tops but it is a little trickier than in weeks past— maternity clothes are still too giant but my regular clothes are definitely too snug. (And I was never really out of maternity clothes between pregnancies, but I did buy a few things in larger sizes and those are being hydrostatically challenged at the waistline now.)

My husband spoke with his mother last night and learned that his grandfather (her father) is not doing well. His conclusion, after the conversation, was that this particular health issue is likely the thing that will kill him, but she’s so ill equipped to accept this herself and also terrible at conveying bad news that the message wasn’t all that clear. Perhaps she thinks this will strike my husband much harder than it has, but he is not especially close to this grandparent, and neither of us now views it as particularly tragic when an 88 year old with a full life behind him is dying. Of course I understand my mother in law’s distress and denial, but in comparison to our year, this just feels more like the natural flow of life and death rather than a jolting experience that truly counts as tragic. So we discussed last night the probability that we should expect to attend a funeral within the year. Obviously this is fine, of course dependent on timing— if it’s too close to the end of this pregnancy I won’t travel for it. Just another strange complication of adulthood. My grandparents all had died by the time I was out of high school but my husband still has three living grandparents, and when his other grandfather died it was almost a total shock to him that people actually do die... it’s a very strange phenomenon to witness when you are connected to this kind of sadness but don’t feel particularly affected by it.

Are you temping? It could be a good way to at least take the anxiety out of knowing whether you're ovulating or not next cycle. I've also gained a lot of weight since before I was pregnant, and half of that has been AFTER the miscarriage in the past month. Combination of comfort eating and drinking too much wine, I suspect. I've recognized that not feeling good about myself physically isn't helping with my mental health, so I'm trying to do more things that I know are good for me physically and mentally, with my mental health as the reward instead of the instant gratification. 

Being out of normal routine is definitely hard. But doing the guided meditations are good! I've been doing them every day with the Insight Timer app - sometimes for grief, sometimes for anxiety, sometimes for energy. The grief ones are great because they give you the permission to feel your emotions fully and then let them go without giving them more power.  I highly recommend a book called Full Catastrophe Living by Jon Kabat-Zinn. I used it a long time ago, but I imagine it would be totally useful for dealing with loss. I have my copy on my bookshelf, maybe I should pull it out too... 

For closure, I would have loved to plant a tree or done a garden memorial, but we live in a small urban apartment. I decided to get a [memorial tattoo](https://imgur.com/wYOannS), and it really did help me feel some small sense of closure. I also am drawing links between the physical healing of the tattoo and my emotional healing. Right now it's kind of tender, and the scabs are peeling off, and I'm really looking forward to seeing it in its final form. 

It also helps that yesterday I got news that my levels went down. The fact that I can't try again for a while really put me a couple steps back in my emotional healing because I really just want to be pregnant again. But now I have to figure out how to not have my life revolve around TTC and pregnancy, because I don't want to be miserable for the next 3-6 months. I am feeling a little better now that I know my levels are coming down, but I think I get super anxious over not having control of things - not having control of my hormone levels, not being able to try until doc says so, etc., so I'm trying to focus on things I can control, like the active self care stuff I was referring to before.

You did the right thing for you at the time. Do not beat yourself up.

So - I’m multiple hours into the epidural. Best decision of my life. 

At 815 the broke my water. At 9pm the waters breaking pain was BAD so we tried IV meds (same as earlier in the day) I almost instantly fell asleep. But at 1015 I woke up with intense back pain like whoa. 

We walked, I bounced, he massaged...I asked for the epidural. I seriously was crying. 

Worried it wouldn’t help cause if back pain/pressure. Sooooo much - felt like I needed a BM/to push. 

Got it at 1130ish...apparently I have a hard back. He struggled a bit and everyone says he’s the best anesthesiologist here soo I was worried . But it worked like a charm.

They checked me while inserting the catheter and said I was at 7 and he was looooow (the push feeling!). 

I’m sleeping on and off ...switching sides with a huge peanut ball between my legs. To try to get baby to flip. Since they think he’s facing the wrong direction and causing the back pain.

I was at a 9 last time they checked. Laboring down, napping, being monitored.

You can easily find research confirming that you have a higher chance of successful pregnancy within 3 months after a miscarriage, rather than later. I suppose WHO will change their guidelines soon.
Doctors usually advice waiting a cycle so that it's easier to date the age of your next pregnancy, but there's no data saying whether or not getting pregnant within the first cycle has a higher chance of miscarriage. No data either on uterus lining needing to shed at least once. However, it's not a given that you will ovulate in the first cycle after D&C. HCG levels are a good sign for how your body is coping hormonally. If they get below 5 and home pregnancy test shows a negative, then you can trust a future pregnancy test. 
What you need to take into account is how you're feeling mentally and physically. It's a good idea to stack up on those prenatal vitamins and folates, and to be at peace with your loss before you ttc again. 
Many women go through a phase of really desperately wanting to get pregnant again after a miscarriage (I am one of them too). 
For me this urge calmed down a little (at least wait till you're no longer spotting!) and if you give yoursel some time (and I'm talking 2 weeks, not 6 months) you will get a clearer view on what you want.

I'm not sure I will share pregnancy with them and with this particular friend, someone who I considered so close to me, I'm not sure I will be sharing at all. is that mean? She has been the biggest source of pain for me since my son died. And what's so sad about it is she used to be the person I always could rely on for comfort. Now, she only is sadness for me.

Had she taken a little bit more discretion or been more sensitive about it, I'd feel so different now.

I don't know that some of our friendships recover from or survive this.

It's another loss on top of our losses. :(

14+5 here and having a pretty mild day as far as nausea is concerned.  

I’ve gotten really into The Great British Baking Show as a perfect distraction for my anxiety.

I’ve started thinking about how we will tell family when we’re ready, which will likely be after the anatomy scan in a couple of weeks.

But that way we can also answer in one place the inevitable questions about whether this is advisable from an emotional/medical standpoint, etc, etc. 

Trickier though, is how to explain it to my three year old. We have told her nothing yet, because she’s quite verbal and we don’t want her to inadvertently spill the beans to her grandparents. She still asks about her baby brother quite regularly, and is still clearly trying to wrap her mind around his stillbirth— sometimes she asks me questions like if he’s still in my tummy. (I’m not really showing much yet, just kind of look lumpier than normal, so I don’t think it’s a question about my size... I hope.)

Well I guess I’m here for now. I should be 4w1d today based on the first day of my last period. I don’t know when I ovulated as this was one of the 2 months a year where I didn’t feel stabbing pains in my side.

I think I first knew on Friday. Friday night we went out to celebrate our anniversary and after 2 big glasses of wine I went to the bathroom and noticed spotting very similar to implantation bleeding. I assumed shark week was coming early but I tested the next morning on a cheapie and.... nothing. I had many more negatives but got my positive on a FRER yesterday with cheapie confirmation today.

Best I can guess, timeline wise, we got pregnant while using protection. We were going to wait till after Christmas to try again, but apparently that wasn’t in the plan. I am very concerned about having a hyper/super receptive uterus because this will be my 3rd pregnancy in less than 8 months. Hopefully I get to take this one home. 

I’m holding off calling the doctors until after Christmas. All they’re going to do this early is have me do betas at best I’m not in a rush to do that, and I’m doing everything else right (vitamins, pregnancy safe blood pressure meds, low dose aspirin) so I think it’s fine to wait.

My hubby and I went to his urologist appointment today. They found a varicocele in his scrotum. It is most likely interfering with his sperm production. Everything else appeared healthy for him, so the urologist was positive that once we get the vein removed, it will significantly boost his sperm count within 2-3 months. It could be possible that after we first got pregnant, the varicocele appeared. He explained it's like having varicose veins pop up anywhere else. It's an easy outpatient procedure. I am scheduling it now for him.

He also suggested we can try Clomid for Men, but he stated it wouldn't be that significant of an increase since his testosterone is good and his main problem is physical, or the varicocele. I think we are going to try it as well just to boost his rates. Like the urologist said, ""there's nothing to lose.""

So yay, progress! And fixable progress. I'm happy it wasn't just some vague diagnosis of infertility. I'm also happy it appears to be temporary. Fingers crossed that we can get this out of the way soon and our TTC efforts will start working.
