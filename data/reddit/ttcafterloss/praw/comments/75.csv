To my surprise the HCG was 460s, and my primary sent me to the ER for suspicion of ectopic. Ultrasounds didn’t show anything, and as it continued to trend up (by 20s and 30s, not the hundreds that a pregnancy would) I was given misoprostol to make sure there was nothing “left over”. 

Back to the ER another few weeks later for intense abdominal pain: They now thought that maybe I had miscarried because the pregnancy was ectopic and now my ovary was twisting on itself because of the strain I had had on my fallopian tube?(FYI, having your Fallopian tube/ovary twisting is an awful feeling. I don’t recommend it.)

 I started bleeding on 2/23, and had my first negative HCG on 4/29. I have not had a day since the start of my miscarriage that I have not had some sort of spotting or bleeding.

If it doesn’t seem like I’m ovulating I’ll have to go back on the make sure no knew cysts have formed. I might lose my mind in a very real way if they come back. If things look clear then he would give me something to help me ovulate. He doesn’t sound convinced I’ll ovulate on my own but here’s to hoping. I know if I ovulate I can get pregnant so I just really hope this does the trick.</p>

Definitely not molar, got ultrasound confirmation of a missed miscarriage on the 21st of March at just over 11+2 - after I'd gotten a ""everything looks great"" dating ultrasound at 6+5, there was a nice heartbeat and everything. Baby died about a week after that, but I kept on feeling pregnant for weeks and didn't miscarry naturally - took misoprostol on the 23rd of March. Have been bleeding since.

I'm guessing retained products of conception (i.e., incomplete miscarriage). But like... getting really tired of my doc's blase attitude toward this whole thing. Why didn't he send me for an ultrasound at my first follow-up? Why didn't he send me for one after my betas came back too high 2 weeks after the miscarriage started? Why didn't he send me for one when I came back three weeks afterward and told him I had been bleeding non-stop since the miscarriage? Why didn't he send me for one after my second round of betas ALSO came back too high and I had been bleeding for five and a half weeks??? I had to take a walk-in appointment and have a breakdown in his office last Friday to get a referral for an ultrasound. 

And what do you know, turns out I'm not a hypochondriac - something is wrong enough that he's booked me at the hospital on Friday. With somebody, for something. He won't tell me who or what, though.

<p>Definitely not molar, got ultrasound confirmation of a missed miscarriage on the 21st of March at just over 11+2 - after I&#39;d gotten a &quot;everything looks great&quot; dating ultrasound at 6+5, there was a nice heartbeat and everything. Baby died about a week after that, but I kept on feeling pregnant for weeks and didn&#39;t miscarry naturally - took misoprostol on the 23rd of March. Have been bleeding since.</p>

<p>I&#39;m guessing retained products of conception (i.e., incomplete miscarriage). But like... getting really tired of my doc&#39;s blase attitude toward this whole thing. Why didn&#39;t he send me for an ultrasound at my first follow-up? Why didn&#39;t he send me for one after my betas came back too high 2 weeks after the miscarriage started? Why didn&#39;t he send me for one when I came back three weeks afterward and told him I had been bleeding non-stop since the miscarriage? Why didn&#39;t he send me for one after my second round of betas ALSO came back too high and I had been bleeding for five and a half weeks??? I had to take a walk-in appointment and have a breakdown in his office last Friday to get a referral for an ultrasound. </p>

<p>And what do you know, turns out I&#39;m not a hypochondriac - something is wrong enough that he&#39;s booked me at the hospital on Friday. With somebody, for something. He won&#39;t tell me who or what, though.</p>

<p>Ugh ugh ugh. I need a new doc but it takes time to switch here and I&#39;ve been living with &quot;bad care is better than no care&quot; as my mantra but I am so so so done with this doc.</p>

So. I'm now on day 40 of miscarriage bleeding. I have had two beta-HCG tests that have come back too high. I finally FINALLY convinced my doc to send me for an ultrasound last Friday. Then I went and got it right away because I am so so so so SO done with all of this.

Today, as I was on my way to work, I got a call back from the doc about my ultrasound. I was told I was being referred to ""a specialist"" (no name given, no occupational designation, nothing... thanks, doc, that's very informative!), and that I have to present myself at X address at Y time this Friday.

Wouldn't tell me what the fuck it's FOR. This wasn't my only active referral, so for a while I thought this was for the sports injury specialist I also need to see. Nope, it's about my ultrasound. But also no, the doc won't tell me WHY. I asked if this was an intake appointment or more tests or what. Wouldn't tell me, apparently I needed to ""discuss that with the specialist"".

When I finally got home (thanks for ruining my workday with ridiculous ambiguity, doc!), I looked up the address and directions I got referred to.

Well APPARENTLY I'm seeing somebody who works in the local hospital's serious pregnancy complications unit. Thanks for telling me that, doc - mind telling me what fucking complications???

My current educated guess is that I have retained products of conception or something. But fucking fuckity fuck, how about letting me know what's going on??? I mean, it must be pretty bad if the doc won't even tell me what kind of appointment this even is, let alone what the test showed???

After that procedure, I had a balloon stent in my uterus for two weeks and was on hormone therapy to build my lining back up. After stopping the hormones I had a period (induced by the medication) and it was almost completely normal. Before that my periods were almost non existent. I could only tell that it was that time of the month based on my basal body temperature and some VERY light spotting. 

So after that period my RE said to expect another natural cycle in 2-4 weeks. I just had that period last week and it was completely normal! First time I've ever been excited to have a period. Our next step is another hysterosalpingogram (HSG) to determine if the surgery was a success. And I actually had that done today, so just waiting to hear back.

Hopefully you don't have to go through all of that, but when you mentioned not having a period despite having symptoms it made me remember what I went through. Any uterine surgery can cause inflammation and eventually lead to scar tissue.

During and immediately after: I took time off work. I ate whatever I felt like without guilt. I binge watched entire TV shows. I basically treated it like the sick day (well, week) I wished I had as a kid. I asked my SO for whatever I needed or wanted. I cried. I cuddled. Whatever it was that helped me survive the day is what I did.

On the physical side: I miscarried at 6w1d and my OB gave me the go ahead to try as soon as I wanted without needing to wait for a period. She had me follow HPTs to negative, after which she treated my betas and said to start testing LH. It was confusing to see high LH strips when I was still spotting, but then I was able to watch them get lighter and have comfort that my body was returning to normal. My LH patterns were also different this time, so testing obsessively helped me catch a surge that went from almost no line to positive in about 12 hours. 

Emotional healing: I think this part is slow and never complete. I will never get that baby back. Sometimes sadness slams into me because I'm not pregnant right now. Sometimes I need to just give myself another sick day. Talking to people on Reddit has helped a lot, made me feel less alone. Monitoring my body more both helps and makes it worse sometimes. I definitely feel like TTC consumes me more than it did before. The hyper awareness I had of my body when I first suspected I was pregnant hasn't left. I'm negative for HCG so I'm not sure why, or if that's just one of the ways this experience has changed me.

On TTC: I feel more pressure to succeed now, which I already felt tremendously because I'm 35. Sometimes it feels like that cycle was ""wasted"" because it wasn't failed but didn't result in a baby. I already felt like I HAD to succeed in six months. I already felt tremendous pressure from others to already have had a baby. Now I feel like I'm down to 4 cycles ""left"" to succeed. I know that's not a reasonable or healthy feeling, but that's one of the things that the MC has left me with. Before, my attitude was that if I didn't succeed in 6 months I could get help. Now, it feels like a countdown to the end of my ability to have a family. Logically I know that's not the case, and that in August if I'm not pregnant I can get testing and help.

I tried to find an all in one that worked for the total I needed and just couldn’t find a brand I trusted or a dosage that worked. I know Thorne makes folate pills in different dosages (I think 5000mcg?) but I started getting concerned about possibly taking too much. I was also hesitant to switch my prenatal brand because it wasn’t making me feel sick and had DHA added as well. I kind of take a crazy amount of pills a day, but it’s been working for me (prenatal, folate, baby aspirin, and fish oil). It’s not exactly cheap and I definitely go through more folate than anything else, but I see it as very minor in the total cost of having a baby. 

When I added in the extra folate, I gradually worked up to the higher dose. So I added 1000 extra micrograms a week until I got to 4000. I’m not sure I actually needed to do that, but I read some people felt weird after rapidly increasing the dosage. I felt good doing it the way I did. 

I did have the standard RPL testing done after my second loss and everything was fine. All my bloodwork was normal except for the MTHFR mutation, nothing wrong with my uterus, always had very predictable cycles, etc. We never got so far as karyotyping or sperm analysis but were considering it if we had another loss. We never saw a RE either, but probably would have after a third loss. My doctors always wanted me to wait three cycles after each loss except the MFM I saw who said it was fine to try again as soon as my cycle was back to normal. I waited three cycles after my first loss and got pregnant right away. I waited two cycles after my second loss and got pregnant on my second cycle. I didn’t have problems getting pregnant, just staying pregnant. 

I totally understand finding a small amount of comfort in the statistics after one loss. Those numbers really helped me cope with my first miscarriage.

It hurts my heart knowing that another set of parents had to make such a painful decision.

Please continue to be there for each other during recovery, and i will encourage you to communicate with your wife as much as you can, and to even cry together. I remember being so dang mad at my husband when he seemed to get over the loss quickly (only realising recently that all this while he was just trying to put on a brave face in order to be that rock for me). His illusion of strength & swift recovery then made me feel so alone in my grief at that point in time.

Lurking around this reddit thread was chicken soup for my soul during the darkest days and I hope you too will find comfort in the stories shared.

My husband and I went though a horribly similar experience start of the year as we made the decision to say goodbye to our healthy little girl at 19 weeks due to leaking fluids and threats of infection after repeated incidents of gushes of blood coming out of me in a 2 week span. I felt even more horrible and angry at the universe when blood tests came back after I was discharged and the doctor could not identify the cause of infection. The guilt of this decision is not something that many people around us understood, and the grief of losing a wanted baby in this manner will feel like the most cruel trick the universe has played. 

I wish to share some practical things that I found helpful for my continued journey to recovery:

(1) Do request for medication to cut off breastmilk. It might be helpful to have it on hand as some doctors may not prescribe them to second trimester loss. My milk supply unexpectedly built up resulting in a really painful chest & having milk leak out without a baby to feed was just wow, awful.

(2) We immediately arranged for a confinement food delivery service for a period of 2 weeks  (it's likely to also be available in Shanghai) and that really helped to pressure my husband and I into eating at least 2 proper and nutritious meal a day at a time when getting off the bed felt impossible and meaningless.

(4) Also on my side of the world, Mother's day is coming up in 2 weeks while Father's day is celebrated in June. I find it helpful to know what potentially triggering days are coming up.

(5) I'm not quite sure if Apple podcast are available in China but 'Terrible, Thanks For Asking' was something that I came across on one of the ttcafterloss posts and it helped me immensely listening to these on the drive home from work.

I'm a children's librarian so I can relate to a lot of what you're saying here. A few days ago I just did my first storytime after my most recent loss.

There were definitely moments that were hard, where I started to slide into my grief. But I also really love kids, and their happiness can be so infectious, and it felt great to let that take over my attention. 

Kids come with a parent or caregiver to Storytime, and being in a room full of moms and dads with their precious little ones and of course pregnant bellies was tough. Briefly I started feeling bitter about how they all managed to do so easily what has so far been impossible for me. But then I caught myself. I don't know, I don't know any of their stories. What I do know is how common infertility and miscarriage are. So then I started thinking about how statistically speaking, a bunch of the people in the room with me had likely struggled to pregnant and/or had miscarriages themselves. We don't know each other's stories but it was comforting for me to imagine that they'd all struggled as I had but had eventually been successful. 

So that's what I'm trying to focus on, that and the joy of actually being with the kids and connecting with them. I know you will struggle too but I hope you can find some things to hang on to that help get through it. I hope you are right about the anticipation anxiety and it's not as bad as you're worried about.

It was devastating seeing him moving on ultrasound even as she was in labor and we knew that he was going to die. 

All this is to say only that you are not alone. My heart goes out to you, your wife, and your son. I am here for you if you need to talk to someone who has walked this road, any time.

One of my best friends also just told me this week that she is pregnant, and she is due a week after when I would have been due.

You have basically three options that I'm aware of: (1) ""expectant management"", where you wait for your body to miscarry naturally - generally they give you about 4 weeks before proposing additional interventions if the miscarriage doesn't happen in that time, (2) medicinally-induced miscarriage, generally with misoprostol. This is the route I took and basically you take the pills (or insert them vaginally, as I was recommended to do by my doc), and within about 6 hours the miscarriage starts, and (3) D&C, a surgical procedure that's not incredibly invasive, and generally is a procedure that you walk out the same day for, but it's still surgery - they dilate your cervix, then use a device called a curette (which will either be a sharp spoony thing or a suction device, depending on the practice) to remove the contents of your uterus.

There are pros and cons to each of your options. The expectant management strategy allows you to avoid potential side effects from interventions, but means you're sort of in a state of limbo while you wait for it to happen. Puts you in a bit of an awkward position in some ways. The medicinal route and expectant management routes both allow you to deal with it at home, but can be pretty scary and will involve passing fetal tissue, amnion, and placenta, as well as endometrial lining. They are, however, less invasive than a D&C. The advantage of the D&C is that you don't have to deal with passing fetal tissue, amnion, and placenta. That's basically what they're trying to remove during the procedure.

All of these options will involve some amount of bleeding afterward. The D&C probably the least, but that depends a lot on the skill of the person who performs your D&C.

I was told that there's not much difference in either rates of complications, or overall satisfaction with the chosen procedure, across the three different options. A lot of it comes down to what you're comfortable with.

I took misoprostol 5 weeks ago for a missed miscarriage (baby died in utero at about 8 weeks, but I did not miscarry right away and continued to produce pregnancy hormones and all of that - I only discovered that things had gone wrong at a routine scan at 11wk3d). I had two days of pretty intense cramping and sort of bursty bleeding (not steady and regular like a period, but rather really big bursts of blood that were very sudden, and then moments when I passed flesh, including a few rather memorable minutes when I passed the placenta pretty much whole - weird-looking organ, a placenta). I know many women experience a lot of pain going this route, but I found it manageable. I took the maximum allowable dose of ibuprofen and kept a hot pad on my lower back the whole time and I was able to eat and drink and go to sleep. However, this is not everybody's experience. If you choose to go this route, I recommend: (1) stockpile the pads, (2) make sure to have lots of painkillers on hand, (3) get yourself some calorie-rich, easy-to-eat foods like juice, chocolate milk, frozen pizzas, veggie plates, etc. Stuff that you don't have to hang out at a stove preparing. (4) consider some adult diapers to make your life easier if you want to go to sleep, and (5) hot pads. Oh my god hot pads. They are really really really good for the cramping.

Many of the women here have been through similar experiences and gone with other options for management - I will leave it to them to tell you about what those are like.

This is the route I took and basically you take the pills (or insert them vaginally, as I was recommended to do by my doc), and within about 6 hours the miscarriage starts, and (3) D&amp;C, a surgical procedure that&#39;s not incredibly invasive, and generally is a procedure that you walk out the same day for, but it&#39;s still surgery - they dilate your cervix, then use a device called a curette (which will either be a sharp spoony thing or a suction device, depending on the practice) to remove the contents of your uterus.</p>

<p>There are pros and cons to each of your options. The expectant management strategy allows you to avoid potential side effects from interventions, but means you&#39;re sort of in a state of limbo while you wait for it to happen. Puts you in a bit of an awkward position in some ways. The medicinal route and expectant management routes both allow you to deal with it at home, but can be pretty scary and will involve passing fetal tissue, amnion, and placenta, as well as endometrial lining. They are, however, less invasive than a D&amp;C. The advantage of the D&amp;C is that you don&#39;t have to deal with passing fetal tissue, amnion, and placenta. That&#39;s basically what they&#39;re trying to remove during the procedure.</p>

<p>All of these options will involve some amount of bleeding afterward. The D&amp;C probably the least, but that depends a lot on the skill of the person who performs your D&amp;C.</p>

<p>I was told that there&#39;s not much difference in either rates of complications, or overall satisfaction with the chosen procedure, across the three different options. A lot of it comes down to what you&#39;re comfortable with.</p>

<p>I took misoprostol 5 weeks ago for a missed miscarriage (baby died in utero at about 8 weeks, but I did not miscarry right away and continued to produce pregnancy hormones and all of that - I only discovered that things had gone wrong at a routine scan at 11wk3d). I had two days of pretty intense cramping and sort of bursty bleeding (not steady and regular like a period, but rather really big bursts of blood that were very sudden, and then moments when I passed flesh, including a few rather memorable minutes when I passed the placenta pretty much whole - weird-looking organ, a placenta). I know many women experience a lot of pain going this route, but I found it manageable. I took the maximum allowable dose of ibuprofen and kept a hot pad on my lower back the whole time and I was able to eat and drink and go to sleep. However, this is not everybody&#39;s experience. If you choose to go this route, I recommend: (1) stockpile the pads, (2) make sure to have lots of painkillers on hand, (3) get yourself some calorie-rich, easy-to-eat foods like juice, chocolate milk, frozen pizzas, veggie plates, etc. Stuff that you don&#39;t have to hang out at a stove preparing. (4) consider some adult diapers to make your life easier if you want to go to sleep, and (5) hot pads. Oh my god hot pads. They are really really really good for the cramping.</p>

<p>Many of the women here have been through similar experiences and gone with other options for management - I will leave it to them to tell you about what those are like.</p>

<p>I am so, so sorry you&#39;re dealing with this. Please don&#39;t hesitate to ask if you have any other questions.</p>

My due date was two weeks ago. She died at 16w5d, a TFMR that I know was the right decision, but it still kills me. When the grief, rage, despair and madness overtakes, I breathe deeply four times.

(inhale) **My body** (exhale) **is strong**. I’m taking care of myself, fiercely. I am exercising, getting proper sleep, taking my vitamins and mostly eating right but dammit I’m having a beer now and then, and a coffee, too.

I am strong.

(inhale) **My mind** (exhale) **is calm**. This is a lie, but I’m visualizing, right? and already on breath two, I can feel myself grow lighter, leveling out the intensity of emotion.

(inhale) **My womb** (exhale) **is warm**. I wanted like hell to be pregnant before the due date. It took a year to conceive the first time, now coming up on two years total of ttc. I know a bean won’t stick in a stress womb, and even calling it that – a slur that feels so true – feels like a curse, a jinx. Screw that. My womb is warm. It’s open and inviting and lush flush full of heat to capture and cradle, to carry a healthy baby fully to term.

(inhale) **My heart** (exhale) **is home**.  This is the hardest to describe, because it’s the hardest to embrace, even though I know it’s true. It’s partly “my husband is my heart.” I call my dogs my heart every day, and they are my family, what’s always here for me, not hanging on a maybe or in the shadow of the pain of what should have been. I am here. I am already everything I am supposed to be. Of course I still want a baby.

Also, you've had 4 losses, so no doctor would expect you to wait a year to run testing. And you shouldn't. I'm glad you're advocating for yourself by setting up appointments. Well done.  


There is a possibility that your hormones are messed up from breastfeeding, but people are able to conceive and carry while still BF'ing, so its really hard to say. DEFINITELY write those questions down and make sure you ask about it.  


As for progesterone, the role of progesterone issues in pregnancy and loss is still highly debated. It is mostly believed that low progesterone during pregnancy is a symptom of the loss not a cause. So going on progesterone after you have already conceived is still ""controversial"" in that we aren't sure it helps. But doctors seem to think it doesn't hurt, either. 

Going on progesterone after you ovulate is another story...although with some similarly controversial thoughts/no clear findings. BUT this is usually the route that many REs will take. THIS route is often prescribed if you have low CD21 results multiple cycles. Low CD21 results could mean that your ovulation is ""weak"" (again, many doctors disagree about this)...going on progesterone at 3dpo COULD help with that. Or taking some form of fertility medicine could also. Or a combination of fertility meds and progesterone. Again - this is studied but does not have incredibly clear findings (which is true about so many things related to fertility and it really sucks). So, if you do test your progesterone, you should ask for it to be tested a few times, not just once.   


Plus, while you have a ""short"" cycle, your luteal phase of 10-11 days is DEFINITELY long enough to conceive. Most doctors aren't concerned unless its 9 days or less.   


4 losses definitely means something is up and I truly hope you can find an answer. Just know that many people don't, which sucks. But trying to find it is a wonderful route to take and its great you are doing it.

<p>In the meantime, this guy&#39;s a complete newbie, too - opened his practice in January. That&#39;s a major part of why I was able to get a new GP here, but boy do I ever miss my old GP, who I lost because I moved to a different city 5hrs away.</p>

<p>I need him to take me seriously, and I am almost certainly the first miscarriage he&#39;s ever dealt with =/</p>

<p>I haven&#39;t found him lacking in knowledge, but certainly he&#39;s got a proven track record of ignoring what I&#39;m saying if it&#39;s even slightly different from what a test says (even if the margin of error of the test result is within what I KNOW to be true).

None of them know I've had 4 losses. I dread the day they find out. I work in a post partum/ baby unit and plan to deliver at my hospital, which means everyone will know my reproductive history (assuming I'm lucky enough to carry another pregnancy).

 I finally made 2 appointments with my OB office, 1 in early May with the nurse practitioner and 1 in early July with my doctor. I kept doubting myself whether I should make one. Like are they going to dismissive of me because some of the losses were early, and it's been less than a year of trying? Then I swing the other way and worry that I'll get a lecture like, ""why did you wait so long to come in?"" I feel guilty that I didn't go sooner. I feel like I'm partially to blame for my losses because something is wrong and I didn't get help sooner. I just kept rationalizing that since most were early that it must be something uncontrollable, and I didn't want to go in and have them shrug it off.

Anyways I plan to ask them to check my progesterone. I feel like I have at least some of the symptoms mildly to moderately. My cycles are short, like 22-23 days. My period always starts 10-11 days after ovulation which from what I've read is short. My theory is that my progesterone isn't rising like it should in early pregnancy, making me miscarry.

Another thing I'm worried about is that I can still express breast milk, but it's been 8 to 9 months since I weaned. Maybe that's what has my hormones out of whack?

Our daughter was stillborn at 25 weeks almost 3 years ago. Like you, we had an almost 3 year old son at home, were building a house made for a big family, I was weeks away from quitting my job...and then she just stopped kicking one day. This was following a nearly 2-year battle with secondary infertility.

Take care of yourself first, work on putting the other details of your life back together once you’ve had some time to grieve. Take advantage of grief counselors and support groups - they help so much! It takes time, but things absolutely do get...I won’t necessarily say “better” because nothing can make what you lost okay...but definitely easier. See this as a chance to spend extra time at home with your son if you’d like that. Or a chance to find a new awesome job to keep your talents busy. I found I had to stop planning my life around “what if we have another baby soon,” and just live like we wouldn’t but hope for the best and keep a contingency plan ready. I would’ve gone crazy otherwise.

If the thought of trying again brings you hope, work with your doctor on a plan for when it’s safe for you to try again. Move into your house and enjoy it’s potential. The story of your family isn’t over - you may still very likely fill up every bedroom you hope to. Pregnancy after a loss is terrifying and will never be as carefree and easy as your first, but the payoff is so worth it. Even if it’s a boy. We had to move to IVF after we lost our daughter (we were dying for another chance at a girl so we did testing on every embryo) - and guess what? ALL BOYS!! I was furious, but the desire for a sibling for our son was the main focus. We had our second son when our oldest was 4. There was definitely gender disappointment, but I wouldn’t give up our new little guy for anything. Brothers are adorable, we’re lucky to have gotten a second kid at all, and just having a second kiddo in the house has been so healing. There will always be elements of your loss that linger, but there’s still so much happiness left ahead. It’s hard to believe now, but you really won’t feel this way forever!",[],,t1_ele7av1,False,0,[],False,"<div class=""md""><p>I’m so sorry for your loss. Our daughter was stillborn at 25 weeks almost 3 years ago. Like you, we had an almost 3 year old son at home, were building a house made for a big family, I was weeks away from quitting my job...and then she just stopped kicking one day. This was following a nearly 2-year battle with secondary infertility.</p>

<p>Take care of yourself first, work on putting the other details of your life back together once you’ve had some time to grieve. Take advantage of grief counselors and support groups - they help so much! It takes time, but things absolutely do get...I won’t necessarily say “better” because nothing can make what you lost okay...but definitely easier. See this as a chance to spend extra time at home with your son if you’d like that. Or a chance to find a new awesome job to keep your talents busy. I found I had to stop planning my life around “what if we have another baby soon,” and just live like we wouldn’t but hope for the best and keep a contingency plan ready. I would’ve gone crazy otherwise.</p>

<p>If the thought of trying again brings you hope, work with your doctor on a plan for when it’s safe for you to try again. Move into your house and enjoy it’s potential. The story of your family isn’t over - you may still very likely fill up every bedroom you hope to. Pregnancy after a loss is terrifying and will never be as carefree and easy as your first, but the payoff is so worth it. Even if it’s a boy. We had to move to IVF after we lost our daughter (we were dying for another chance at a girl so we did testing on every embryo) - and guess what? ALL BOYS!! I was furious, but the desire for a sibling for our son was the main focus. We had our second son when our oldest was 4. There was definitely gender disappointment, but I wouldn’t give up our new little guy for anything. Brothers are adorable, we’re lucky to have gotten a second kid at all, and just having a second kiddo in the house has been so healing. There will always be elements of your loss that linger, but there’s still so much happiness left ahead. It’s hard to believe now, but you really won’t feel this way forever!</p>

I was induced with my son. They gave me miso (cytotec?) and I started having contractions within a couple of hours. It felt like bad period cramps. 

I was offered all the options for pain.  Tylenol-> fentanyl -> epidural. I appreciated being able to walk around and go to the bathroom, but it’s also true to ask for the epidural a little before you really need it—it takes time to get the anesthesiologist, perform the insertion, and have it take effect.

The hormonal changes made me cold. I appreciated having a cardigan. But the nurses can also pile on the blankets.

The contractions dilate you. Once you’re far enough, I felt an urge to push, and only needed a couple of pushes. (OB said <12 hrs for me to dilate enough, maybe less for you since you’re not quite as far along, so baby is smaller.) 

We also weren’t sure we wanted to see/hold the baby. But we did, and we took pictures, and the hospital also made foot and hand prints. 

The main concern is, depending on when baby passed away, their condition may be good or it may not. Your OB might be able to let you know if their condition might make viewing tough. If it’s only been a few days since baby passed, they are likely to look tiny, but amazing and perfect in their own way.

You don’t have to know you want pictures either. You can always have them taken and put them away, so if/when you want them, you have them, 

Having those memories of my son really helped—especially in the first few weeks, and milestones like his due date. 

Also, your milk may come in. If nothing else, a tight fitting bra (sports bra) 24/7 and drinking lots of mint or sage tea will help. Cool cabbage leaves against the breasts are also supposed to help. Or maybe your OB will prescribe you something.

Mine was no more or less traumatic than yours- we both lost what would have been and that is heartbreaking no matter what. I definitely feel you on the jealousy- I’m not typically a jealous person, but I often think that “that was supposed to be me”. It’s totally up to you if you want to tell people. I always felt a little awkward doing it, but I still did it, and I was always glad I did. There were a few times I said something about it and the other person was legitimately curious about it and I am more than happy to explain things- the more people are aware, the better, IMO.</p>

It’s so important for you to know that whatever you are feeling is ok- angry, sad, guilty, jealous, anything- allow yourself to feel and don’t feel bad about your feelings.

You mentioned not knowing anyone who miscarried- unfortunately, I bet you do know at least one person. My OB said 1 in 3 pregnancies end in a miscarriage.. I’ve learned that it’s not that they’re not happening, it’s more that so many aren’t talking about it.

I didn’t even know most of them had gotten pregnant to begin with. You are not alone.

As far as the physical aspects, everyone is different. Did you have a missed miscarriage? A D&C? Or did it happen “naturally”? I had a missed miscarriage and had a D&C a week later. My OB told me we could have sex and try again before my period, that I don’t need to wait. I was actually a bit surprised by that. I would think waiting until after your next period would ensure that everything is cleared out? I’m not sure. 

I’m so sorry you are going through this. The thing that helped me most was talking with other women who went through it as well. No one else was able to relate like they can and other people often said things that, although they didn’t mean to, were hurtful. This is a fantastic group of women who have helped me so much. It’s just nice to know you’re being understood.

I’m so sorry to read this. I just went through this about two weeks ago when I was almost 12w but baby measured 9 with no hb. I’m not saying there’s no room for human error, but I Think the ultrasound technicians and drs are overly cautious before diagnosing a mc for exactly this reason.

But when I was laying there in the hospital about to get my d&c, my mom did ask this. The surgeon said that while they were sure, they only do a last minute us at the request of the patient because otherwise it can be traumatizing all over again. 

My point is-if it’s something that’s really going to bother you or you’re hung up on it, ask them to check again. Feel free to read my comment history about my d&c as well, it went super smoothly and I know everyone has the absolute right to make the decision that’s best for them and their body, but I bled for 2 days before my d&c and I was so incredibly relieved to have it definitely over and not have to wait around in pain and bleeding for it to happen on its own.

Which one(s) are you using? I used clearblue connected (or something like that, it connects the results via bluetooth to your phone...) and then ordered Wondfos from Amazon.

Basically, test every day around the same time. With clearblue, test every morning with FMU and it detects a rise in estrogen and the LH peak. With Wondfos, you’re supposed to test in the afternoon (between 2 and 4) and read the results between 3 and 5 minutes. BUT I tested with FMU, afternoon, and evening, using the Wondfos. Just limit liquids the 2 hours before you take the test.

When I tested with clearblue and it indicated high fertility, but I wasn’t sure when the LH peak was happening, so I got the Wondfos and those were able to pinpoint when the actual LH rise happened. It was actually pretty cool. The clearblue only tells you the day that you’re probably having the surge. If you do Wondfos right, they can give you a more precise idea of when it happens. 

The LH surge happens BEFORE you ovulate. So when you see the surge, you should get busy. And for like 2 days after. It’s possible that LH stays elevated for a day or two, so you can keep testing after you get a positive to see if that happens. Clearblue won’t let you do that.

Generally people go for two weeks or even less. The initial consultation and labs can be done remotely at a local clinic, and so can the early IVF cycle monitoring labs and ultrasounds, though this might add some expense (maybe another $200 per appointment). The only windows where you'd have to travel are towards the end of IVF stimulation meds when you'd be closer to retrieval, and then for the embryo transfer itself. If you did PGS genetic testing, it would be two trips since the embryos would be tested after one retrieval and available for transfer during your next cycle. So that would be one trip for retrieval (probably a 4-5 day window if you went abroad, just one day if you drove to a place like CNY) and one for embryo transfer (two days if abroad, one day if driving). 

People travel for IVF very commonly because it really can be much cheaper than many local clinics, even with travel costs.

This explanation gives me some comfort to think that it’s around 18-22th day of my cycle so I’m hoping the blood supply is sufficient to build a nice cushy womb for my baby.</p>

Our results came back totally normal, so we&#39;ll never know exactly why my daughter died. She was my first baby too, and I&#39;m 28 (27 at the time). </p>

<p>Our OB is recommending waiting another 6 months after a recent septic MC, so I&#39;m looking at the end of Sept/Oct. as the first month we can try again. It&#39;s super disheartening and depressing. So I understand how hard the waiting is in that respect too. </p>

I’d really recommend trying out fertility friend for cycle tracking. Even with just OPKs, their algorithm is far above any other app as they use the data you input and don’t run off of an average. Taking Charge of Your Fertility is also a great read. 

With a 28 day cycle you can reasonably expect ovulation approx 10-16 days prior to your period, CD 12-18. And after getting a positive OPK, ovulation generally occurs between 12-48 hours but its possible to ovulate either prior to a positive or up to 3 days after. Unfortunately without temping there’s no way to know what your body’s pattern is. If you ovulate on the later side with a shorter LP, you could potentially be missing your window if you’re only having sex on the days directly around a positive OPK. Also, sex every other day is recommended so sperm has time to rebuild. 

Other than that I feel you 100% on the frustration. We had a loss in October too and have been trying without success, and I feel insane doing the same things month after month without results.

After all the pills, ultrasounds check for scarring and blood work, it ended up being that my body just needed longer to heal. Just know that you aren’t alone in this.</p>

<p>Edit: also adding that I didn’t get over my loss by myself. I actually had to go to a grief counselor for a few months who helped me process my feelings and get me out of the deep depression I had fallen into. If you are feeling hopeless or like you can’t do this anymore, please know that there are options and help if you need it.</p>

For me it helped that we were not trying again ASAP, so we were able to regain sex as just a fun part of our relationship and not just as a means to make another baby.</p>

<p>But my wife is incredible and noticed this and always made a point to tell me that there was no right or wrong way to grieve. She reminds me it is our loss.  Together.  Having her validation in my grief in whatever form it took (and still takes) made everything bareable.  She gave me &quot;permission&quot; to not be stoic when I didn&#39;t feel I could.  She showed me that she needed me to feel whatever I needed to feel. Not to hide it.  To talk or not talk to just lay there holding eachother.<br/>
Be open with eachother don&#39;t stop checking in. Make sure you both know it&#39;s ok to be honest. It&#39;s ok to not be ok. And it&#39;s ok for one of you to have a good day and the other to not have a good day.  Remind him it&#39;s ok to hurt so badly and that you even if no one else does see his pain and it is valid. 
Sorry for the long ramble....hope it helped at least a little.</p>

I think we change hearts and minds one at a time and oftentimes it takes knowing someone personally for people to understand the issue. 

Voting is super important too. I will never ever vote for an anti-choice candidate. I also volunteered for Planned Parenthood for awhile and I donate to NARAL Pro-Choice America a lot. If you live near a clinic, you could ask if they need any volunteers. There are also some programs where you can become an ab0rtion doula - I know there’s one in Los Angeles.

Even if they don't have a regular spot for you, they might have something else that works. A lot of people love horses like a tourist loves a particular city. It's nice from afar, and you love to visit once a year, but you're not really there for the day-in and day-out. So if you explain that you've found yourself with too much time on your hands and too much grief in your life, they might be able to find something for you. 

Horses are often very social and miss their people, especially after the horse or the people get too old to ride. Even if you just walk through the stables, visiting horse after horse, it might be good for you and for the horses. Plus, if you find one that you really bond with, you might be able to get lessons on that horse. 

I'm not a horse person, but my aunt is. She had a horse that she never had enough time to visit. She let the equestrian center use her horse (Lady Bug) for riding lessons for wheelchair bound kids because the horse was so gentle.

I know that walking around a stable isn't as fun as riding horses, but not being much of a horse person myself, I found walking around talking to horses and petting them pretty fun. It was wild to feed them at first, and some horses were definitely a lot more grabby than others-- just like with dogs-- some would take a treat so gentle and others would just about rip your hand off trying to get the treats.",[],,t1_ekrj2mx,False,0,[],False,"<div class=""md""><p>I&#39;d like to encourage you to reach out to them and explain a bit more about your situation. Even if they don&#39;t have a regular spot for you, they might have something else that works. A lot of people love horses like a tourist loves a particular city. It&#39;s nice from afar, and you love to visit once a year, but you&#39;re not really there for the day-in and day-out. So if you explain that you&#39;ve found yourself with too much time on your hands and too much grief in your life, they might be able to find something for you. </p>

<p>Horses are often very social and miss their people, especially after the horse or the people get too old to ride. Even if you just walk through the stables, visiting horse after horse, it might be good for you and for the horses. Plus, if you find one that you really bond with, you might be able to get lessons on that horse. </p>
