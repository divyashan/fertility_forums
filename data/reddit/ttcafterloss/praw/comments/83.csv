Last week I was still happily pregnant with my first baby girl. I got a call from my GP's office to come in for a chat about the NIPT result and I knew then something was not right. I was told that there's an 85% chance of Trisomy 13. I was bleeding the entire weekend but still had some hope after reading about all the positive outcomes. Deep down I could feel that it probably was not the case for me. Yesterday we went to the hospital for genetic counselling and a CVS but we didn't even get to it because the scan showed a tiny baby with no heartbeats..Supposed to be at 11w3d, she measured at only 8w2d. At least we got to see her one last time. I started getting intense cramping and sharp pain right after the scan and was taken to ER. I got a D&C done this morning. I woke up drowsy and felt so weirdly at peace. Maybe it was the deep sleep I desperately needed for the past week.

It is one of those things that I never thought would happen to me. We're both relatively young and in perfect health. I have two little boys with uneventful pregnancies. (Though I ended up with a psychological birth trauma with the second one but it was nothing compared to this loss. I was fine after this birth and it took over 7 months until the trauma surfaced and I started showing PTSD-like symptoms.

I'm trying to process it the best I could and hold onto my family and friends. I feel a strong need to acknowledge that she existed but I don't know how.. All I've got is an ultrasound print out. 

We named her Hilda.",[],,t1_f40kwi7,False,0,[],False,"<div class=""md""><p>Everything happened so quickly. Last week I was still happily pregnant with my first baby girl. I got a call from my GP&#39;s office to come in for a chat about the NIPT result and I knew then something was not right. I was told that there&#39;s an 85% chance of Trisomy 13. I was bleeding the entire weekend but still had some hope after reading about all the positive outcomes. Deep down I could feel that it probably was not the case for me. Yesterday we went to the hospital for genetic counselling and a CVS but we didn&#39;t even get to it because the scan showed a tiny baby with no heartbeats..Supposed to be at 11w3d, she measured at only 8w2d. At least we got to see her one last time. I started getting intense cramping and sharp pain right after the scan and was taken to ER. I got a D&amp;C done this morning. I woke up drowsy and felt so weirdly at peace. Maybe it was the deep sleep I desperately needed for the past week.</p>

<p>It is one of those things that I never thought would happen to me. We&#39;re both relatively young and in perfect health. I have two little boys with uneventful pregnancies. (Though I ended up with a psychological birth trauma with the second one but it was nothing compared to this loss. I was fine after this birth and it took over 7 months until the trauma surfaced and I started showing PTSD-like symptoms. So I know that even though I&#39;m feeling ok now, I&#39;m not out of the woods yet and I don&#39;t know if I ever will..)  This has been a humbling experience for us and I miss her so much already. I&#39;m trying to process it the best I could and hold onto my family and friends. I feel a strong need to acknowledge that she existed but I don&#39;t know how.. All I&#39;ve got is an ultrasound print out. </p>

It's possible that up to 50% of pregnancies are lost. For the longest time, the estimates were lower because it was often impossible to detect pregnancy outside of a doctor's blood test before a missed period. Chemical pregnancies are probably the most common type of loss, and they can occur to literally anyone for no reason. 

Often the ""reason"" is chromosomal abnormalities in either the sperm or the egg, or both. Neither of these need to automatically be causes for concern, as everybody drops a ""bad egg"" and/or succeeds with a ""bad sperm"" now and then. Or the bastocyte just fails to divide and develop properly, Or, or, or.

But it wasn't that one thing you ate, that extra strenuous spin class, the one after-work drink, etc. etc.

This doesn't make any of it easier, but it helped me to know that it was incredibly common. 

IF -- and it's a big if for the vast majority of people -- there is genuinely something to be concerned about, you'll likely know within 6 months of trying, provided you're tracking your ovulation properly and timing sex well. And then you can speak to a doctor about narrowing down any issues.

The 12 month estimate often pertains more to people who aren't using aids like temping or OPKs to narrow down their fertile window.

What I've been doing is basically acting like I am pregnant again so I'm in the best condition to have a healthy pregnancy next time. This is a very personal choice on my part and is in no way the only choice.

<p>We haven’t told many people so I’m still struggling to pretend that everything is okay when we are out in public. Last night I broke down after spending time with friends because I felt guilty for having a fun time when really all I wanted to do was curl up and cry.</p>

<p>Hubby has been so good to me and understanding and I know life will go on, but it doesn’t make the pain feel any better. If anything it hurts more to know I have to keep moving on.</p>

<p>I cannot imagine the pain that some of you feel for babies that have been lost later in pregnancy or life. The pain must be unspeakable.</p>

<p>Thinking of all of you today, as we honor what we have all lost.</p>

There is no joy in this pregnancy and the stress is all consuming. I completely understand. We are TFMR. If the CVS comes back positive as well, I look forward to a welcome break from TTC/pregnancy stress.

I thought we were in for a super long ride to get pregnant again. I was floored when 8 weeks later, I am staring at a positive test under my kitchen lights. That was the exact opposite of my first pregnancy journey. Then came the betas - I was scared they'd be low, just like they were for my MMC.

Then came all the ultrasounds that actually showed cardiac activity. The whole time I just kept waiting for the shoe to drop...

What I am saying is the experience could not have been more different. all that stuff about different sperm/egg was completely true in my case. This pregnancy has been nothing like the first at all. Our baby tested clear for all genetic & structural abnormalities, and despite a really, really awful pregnancy so far (unrelated to any miscarriage reasons), we are still hanging on and it is a world of difference from the last one.

Keep reminding yourself that if you get pregnant, everything is new. It is not history repeating itself, it is a whole new collection of cells and DNA that is completely unaware of the last one.

Our miscarriage was very likely due to chromosomal abnormalities (the odds of it being so are high anyways, but the OB had good reason to suspect based on what she saw on ultrasound).

My first cycle was anovulatory, my second resulted in a very light period, and I&#39;m now on the third but naturally got horribly sick and am assuming I&#39;m probably out as a result.</p>

<p>I got obsessed about changing diet, exercising more or less, cutting out coffee, etc. The reality is that I wasn&#39;t doing any of that when I got pregnant the first time, and everyone has assured me that it wasn&#39;t behavior that lead to the miscarriage but just &quot;bad luck&quot; (most likely -- since it was my first).</p>

<p>I mean, a good rule of thumb when TTC is to eat, drink and exercise like you already are pregnant just so that when it happens you&#39;re not making a huge lifestyle change. But more than likely, a huge diet overhaul is going to cause stress to your system which might just inhibit conception anyway.</p>

Welcome, fellow Type A-er. I'm sorry to say...miscarriage and TTC are \*rough\* for people who want to plan everything. When I tell people about my 5 losses, the one thing I almost always say is that it truly taught me to be more flexible. Not that I wanted that at all, I like being a planner. But ugggh learning that you truly can't control stuff is hard. 

In that same vein... you can't control it. Being healthy is GREAT.  For you in general and also for a future pregnancy. So working towards that goal while also TTC'ing makes sense. But waiting while you cut out sugar/etc is just not necessary. And unless you have some specific complication, most likely there is no reason to wait to TTC due to your early loss.

There are LOTS of rabbit holes you can go down...even scientific ones like testing. But the thing is, early loss is VERY common. I wouldn't necessarily put yourself through the testing ringer right now, either. 

Eat healthy, take care of yourself both physically and emotionally, and move forward as best you can.

Usually it can take anywhere from 2 weeks to 2 months for HCG to leave your body and resume normal ovulation. Take HCG tests daily and when they show up negative you know that you’re period should start 2-4 weeks after that. You can’t get pregnant until HCG is at a bare minimum bc it prevents ovulation while it’s in your body. 

Drs will also say avoid sex / tampons for 2 weeks post MC to avoid bacteria infections. 

Every woman is very different. So Drs will say “start again with your next normal period.” So that would be Cycle Day 1. In the meantime be sure to keep taking prenatals daily, (some take up to 3 months to get into your system) and you can read and research.

You can also both take a genetic test to ensure neither one of you are carriers to the same diseases (rare but it happens). Your OB can check you for endo, fibroids, cysts, polyps, and anything else that might hinder a successful pregnancy and your SO can do semen analysis if that might be an issue.

I liked that it got into what comes after TFMR. Maybe because that’s where I was when I found it. But the grief, thinking about TTC again, pregnancy after loss, etc., it gave me a roadmap.

Our bereavement counselor also gave us *A Time to Decide, A Time to Heal*, which was particularly helpful in that it taught us that each parent would grieve in their own way and at their own pace. 

We got a lot of materials from the hospital post-partum which talked about the importance of memory making with your baby for grief and healing. Ironic because by that point, we’d already said good bye to our son and held him for the last time, ie it was given too late. But my other reading had prepared me, and in the weeks after, all the memory stuff we had—footprints, photos, memories of things we’d done together in his last days, were all a big comfort.

<p>I liked that it got into what comes after TFMR. Maybe because that’s where I was when I found it. But the grief, thinking about TTC again, pregnancy after loss, etc., it gave me a roadmap.</p>

<p>Our bereavement counselor also gave us <em>A Time to Decide, A Time to Heal</em>, which was particularly helpful in that it taught us that each parent would grieve in their own way and at their own pace. </p>

<p>We got a lot of materials from the hospital post-partum which talked about the importance of memory making with your baby for grief and healing. Ironic because by that point, we’d already said good bye to our son and held him for the last time, ie it was given too late. But my other reading had prepared me, and in the weeks after, all the memory stuff we had—footprints, photos, memories of things we’d done together in his last days, were all a big comfort. So I’d suggest reading up on that a little, and thinking about what you might want in that respect. </p>

<p>I’m so very sorry you’ve gotten this terrible news. I’ll be thinking about you and your family.</p>

Just a little over two weeks ago, we got the terrible news at our anatomy scan at 18 weeks that our son had Amniotic Band Syndrome, and his intestines/liver had formed outside of his body in addition to other lethal defects.  We elected to do a D&E, and since my state doesn't allow terminations after 20 weeks, we had to make the decision quickly.  A week ago I had the procedure done, and have been mourning the loss since.  I can tell you that even though it took a huge emotional toll, everything physically went more easily than I thought it would.  The doctor who performed the procedure told me to mourn the son that I had wanted and loved, but to also think of that horrible day as the beginning of my journey to the future beautiful little one that I could have.  That might not be comforting to everyone, but it helped me so much.  

There's also a support group called [Ending a Wanted Pregnancy](https://endingawantedpregnancy.com/).  Their website has tons of information, articles, and personal accounts.

Plus now knowing that probably half of my cycles are a waste due to the one tube, ugh. How do I have hope after this? Maybe my second opinion appointment next week will help. They said I could potentially be seen as an IF patient so they can stimulate ovulation on the correct side, while increasing chance of multiples so one might stick. Feeling hopeless.</p>

I go to therapy regularly and it helps. When it comes to sleeping I’ve found that on the days I exercise I sleep a lot better, I now go to the gym 4-5 times a week. I also got new bedding to make my bed as comfortable and relaxing as possible and I turn on a diffuser with lavender oil in it a few house before I go to bed. 

During the day when I’m out running errands, or whatever, I wear noise canceling headphones and listen to my favorite music. I’m triggered by pregnant people and people with babies so if I can’t hear the crying babies or whatever I do better. 

Lastly when I start to feel the anxiety build and a panic attack approaching I try to refocus my brain. I have a few “games” I play. 1) I’ll take in my surrounding and go through the alphabet and assign a letter to something I see, A: asphalt B: bush C: car etc. 2) I go through the colors and list off what I see. If I’m with my husband he’ll list off a color for me and I’ll find the object so that way we’re getting through it together and I’m not doing it alone. 3) I focus on a textile like the weave of a blanket or my dogs fur I just sit where I am, breathing slowly and controlled and put all of my energy in being aware of how this one thing feels.

Hey guys, not sure if this is the best place to post, but joining here after what will likely be a MC or early pregnancy loss at 5 weeks. We've been trying for 4 years - 6 failed IUIs, one failed FET, and what we thought was a successful FET after an ERA. We transferred 2 AAs on 9/11, and beta was 1166 on 9/23. Ecstatic, as we had never seen a positive, or had any hope since our IF saga began.
Started bleeding at 5 weeks, and got the response where it could be something or nothing...went in for a beta and it was 3503, so they thought we were okay. I bled for 3 days, but with no cramps or pain, went in for an ultrasound at my monitoring clinic, and they couldn't see a sac or an SCH.
My RE calls after receiving the ultrasounds (I moved in the middle of this process, so travel for transfers) and she said the ultrasound was crappy and she wants to do this on her machines. So flying back and now that's tomorrow. Took a HPT today and the line is getting fainter, so I am guessing my hunch was right, and I'm out.

I'm not sure what questions to ask tomorrow, besides how soon can we try again? I was told to make sure it's not ectopic since the betas were relatively high, but would appreciate any other input! We have 5 more AB embryos frozen, and the last two transfers we tried 2 each. I wonder if that hurt our cause? I'm just at such a loss right now.

So flying back and now that&#39;s tomorrow. Took a HPT today and the line is getting fainter, so I am guessing my hunch was right, and I&#39;m out.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not sure what questions to ask tomorrow, besides how soon can we try again? I was told to make sure it&#39;s not ectopic since the betas were relatively high, but would appreciate any other input! We have 5 more AB embryos frozen, and the last two transfers we tried 2 each. I wonder if that hurt our cause? I&#39;m just at such a loss right now. Thanks friends!</p>

This is my first post here, but it doesn’t really feel appropriate to post this in the May 2020 bumpers thread anymore. Last week I went in for my first U/S and they didn’t really see anything but the sac so I have to go back in two weeks for a second one. My doctor told me not to lose all hope and my Husband is trying to be positive but I’m almost certain I know the outcome, especially because things always felt off to me. But I haven’t had any spotting or bleeding which is also annoying because I wish my body would give me a clearer sign one way or the other. Being in limbo sucks. I’m trying to prepare myself for the likely outcome and then get back on the horse to try again.  

Anyone been in a similar position and have to pick between a pill or d&c? Which did you pick and why? What was your experience? How long did it take for you cycle to regulate?

My husband and I were tested on that chromosome and the result was “no result” so we won’t know. They have offered to do additional testing on both of us but we have declined. With the knowledge we may have a 25% reoccurrence chance if we are carriers. 

We lost our daughter in April and started trying again in July. I got pregnant and MC at 7w which was fine since it didn’t feel like losing a baby, like it did with my daughter. (Not discounting MC for others). 

I have been through a lot in my life and maybe that’s what is making the idea of trying again Vs a 25% loss doable. 

With my daughters condition we should have been able to spot it by 12w but I had the worst Dr in the world. (Switched practices at 24w and they found her abnormalities instantly). I would find out early and I would be able to end the pregnancy before my child felt pain. Losing a pregnancy late or god forbid after they are born is so excruciating.

We lost our daughter at 26w. Her Lung development stopped at 17w, pleural effusion, clubbed hands and feet, echogenic bowel, and the list goes on). We had her genes tested and the she had a duplication of her telemeres at the end of chromosome 21. No known cases like her. </p>

<p>My husband and I were tested on that chromosome and the result was “no result” so we won’t know. They have offered to do additional testing on both of us but we have declined. With the knowledge we may have a 25% reoccurrence chance if we are carriers. </p>

<p>We lost our daughter in April and started trying again in July. I got pregnant and MC at 7w which was fine since it didn’t feel like losing a baby, like it did with my daughter. (Not discounting MC for others). </p>

<p>I have been through a lot in my life and maybe that’s what is making the idea of trying again Vs a 25% loss doable. </p>

<p>With my daughters condition we should have been able to spot it by 12w but I had the worst Dr in the world. (Switched practices at 24w and they found her abnormalities instantly). I would find out early and I would be able to end the pregnancy before my child felt pain. Losing a pregnancy late or god forbid after they are born is so excruciating.

So sorry for the loss of your son. It’s the worst thing to have to through. The grief can be overwhelming at times but it gets a little more manageable. Just know that we take on all the pain so our babies don’t have to. 

My wife and I have been through a very similar situation. Our son was diagnosed with an extremely rare life limiting genetic disorder shortly after he was born. Unfortunately this went undetected during the pregnancy but he was measuring small. Docs said not to worry. As soon as he was born he was unable to eat and had no muscle tone. We found out when he was 3 weeks old that he inherited the disease and that we are carriers for it.

His health continued to deteriorate in the nicu and we eventually had meetings with palliative care team. They talked about how poor his quality of life would be and how unlikely he was to survive past infancy. We moved to a children’s hospice to focus on comfort care and he passed away when he was 10 weeks old in April of last year.

This is also a recessive disorder and therefore 1/4 chance each time. We too jumped into IVF for preimplantation genetic testing. Got the probe made and we got 3 embryos suitable for transferring. Unfortunately all 3 failed to implant.

IVF was a very financially emotionally and physically hard journey. We couldn’t understand how it didn’t work since we had no fertility issues. 

When trying to decide if we should do another cycle we actually got pregnant naturally. It was hard to be happy since we knew we might not be able to keep the pregnancy and have to terminate potentially. We did a CVS at 12 weeks and luckily the odds were in our favour this time. The baby did not inherit the disease and we are expecting this little rainbow girl in January.

Ivf with pgd is definitely the safest route. It has worked for others many times and I think we just got unlucky. We were fortunate to get pregnant naturally but It was so scary waiting to do the cvs. Being a genetic carrier sucks. Losing a child is unbearable. But Some how we carry on. 

There are some good support groups for both ivf with pgd and genetic carriers on Facebook. Very active with lots of people going through similar things.

People are going to say to you “it’s not meant to be” or “you’ll get pregnant again.” I find those comments the hardest at times.

It hurt, and it’s supposed to. I also found myself feeling guilty when I was “ok” with having a miscarriage. Stay mindful of your thoughts and anxieties. stop and notice your thoughts, feel the anxieties and then breathe them away.
I hope this helps, because you’re a rock star and you can overcome anything.

To be honest I’m not doing much better at all.

I think if it is possible, the medical option is always preferred. For my hysteroscopy (not the same thing as a D&C, but it was to handle retained products of conception bc misoprostol failed and I got sepsis...) I had to take general anesthetic (recommended to me by the anesthesiologist for a number of reasons, despite the fact I wanted to take twilight sedation instead), which always carries with it the risk of issues. Just having horribly low blood pressure after the anesthetic sucked.

Despite the fact I was in the 1% of people for whom misoprostol fails, and despite all the complications, if I had any subsequent miscarriages I wouldn't even think twice about taking it again.

<p>I think if it is possible, the medical option is always preferred. For my hysteroscopy (not the same thing as a D&amp;C, but it was to handle retained products of conception bc misoprostol failed and I got sepsis...) I had to take general anesthetic (recommended to me by the anesthesiologist for a number of reasons, despite the fact I wanted to take twilight sedation instead), which always carries with it the risk of issues. Just having horribly low blood pressure after the anesthetic sucked.</p>

<p>Despite the fact I was in the 1% of people for whom misoprostol fails, and despite all the complications, if I had any subsequent miscarriages I wouldn&#39;t even think twice about taking it again.

The procedure was pretty painful. I know many people say it didn't really feel too bad but it was pretty bad for me.

<p>The procedure was pretty painful. I know many people say it didn&#39;t really feel too bad but it was pretty bad for me. I saw a specialist in Boston and he confirmed that I did not have scarring but he did see some tissue that he snipped away as my uterus showed slight t-shape. My RE had seen what she thought was scarring during saline ultrasound and he agreed he could see how that could have been diagnosed but in the end it was not. The entire thing lasted about 7 minutes.

Also that your health care professionals haven’t taken more care in discussing this with you. 

I had a partial molar pregnancy last year. It was awful and frightening I’m sorry you are experiencing that too. 

The statistics are good though. It is something like a 1/100 chance that a partial mole will become persistent or spread, so the most likely outcome is that you have a lot of blood tests to tell you that you are ok. 

If you are unfortunate and the 1/100, because you are being monitored and it is caught so early, there is a 100% survival rate with chemotherapy treatment and no lasting fertility issues. 

Charring Cross hospital in the UK are the world leaders in terms of research and best practice following a molar pregnancy. They recommend weekly tests until negative after a partial molar pregnancy and then a follow up test to ensure it is still negative before trying to conceive again. In my case, I had a D&C in the first week of November and was given the all clear go try to conceive again in the first week of January, everyone’s hormone levels start at a different point and fall at a different rate though. 

It’s a shit thing. No matter how positive the outlook, that doesn’t change that you lost a baby and while you are trying to process that, someone starts talking about tumours and chemotherapy and who expects that to happen when they think they are going to have a baby?

I had a D&E. Respected my wait. I healed and all was well for months (physically). Then I had an unrelated laparoscopic cystectomy. Infection risks are so low I didn’t even get antibiotics after.  I’m not feeling super great at my two week post op check up but whatever, surgery, right? I ignore the discomfort and tough it out.

 A few days later I’m in crippling pain. Like legit puking because it hurts so bad. Head to the ER. I have a pelvic abscess the size of a grapefruit that has displaced my uterus. I am in a state of sepsis. Once that’s under control we discover I have peritonitis (another type of infection). Hospitalized for a month. All kinds of crappy shit. Antibiotics (cipro, flagyl, zyvox and more)October through January. My life/health is still impacted a year (next week) later. 

Infectious disease docs are unsure of the infection’s origin. Some think it was a latent result of the D&E, others think it was the lap. Doesn’t matter to me at this point.

We lost our baby in the last days of 2017 and next cycle will be our first earnestly trying  since we conceived her.

""Time will help you,"" said Marilla, who was racked with sympathy but could never learn to express it in other than age-worn formulas.

""It doesn't seem fair,"" said Anne rebelliously. ""Babies are born and live where they are not wanted--where they will be neglected-- where they will have no chance. I would have loved my baby so--and cared for it so tenderly--and tried to give her every chance for good. And yet I wasn't allowed to keep her.""

""It was God's will, Anne,"" said Marilla, helpless before the riddle of the universe--the why of undeserved pain. ""And little Joy is better off.""

""I can't believe that,"" cried Anne bitterly. Then, seeing that Marilla looked shocked, she added passionately, ""Why should she be born at all--why should any one be born at all--if she's better off dead? I don't believe it is better for a child to die at birth than to live its life out--and love and be loved--and enjoy and suffer--and do its work--and develop a character that would give it a personality in eternity. And how do you know it was God's will? Perhaps it was just a thwarting of His purpose by the Power of Evil. We can't be expected to be resigned to that.""

""Oh, Anne, don't talk so,"" said Marilla, genuinely alarmed lest Anne were drifting into deep and dangerous waters. ""We can't understand--but we must have faith--we must believe that all is for the best. I know you find it hard to think so, just now. But try to be brave--for Gilbert's sake. He's so worried about you. You aren't getting strong as fast as you should.""

""Oh, I know I've been very selfish,"" sighed Anne. ""I love Gilbert more than ever--and I want to live for his sake. But it seems as if part of me was buried over there in that little harbor graveyard-- and it hurts so much that I'm afraid of life.""

""It won't hurt so much always, Anne.""

""The thought that it may stop hurting sometimes hurts me worse than all else, Marilla.""

This is my exact story. First pregnancy was Trisomy 13 we TFMRed at 13 weeks. I am a RBT 13;14 carrier. There are some amazing groups on Facebook- one for translocations and one for robertsonian (RBT) which I’m guessing is what you or your husband carry. 

IVF was not in our budget, though we did go for the consultation. 45k with no help from insurance was not an option for us. Since we got pregnant on the first try we decided to give it a go again. We again got pregnant on the first try- this time with twins. One miscarried at 7 weeks. The other is a healthy carrier like me due in two short months. There’s no way to know the percent of eggs or sperm affected. Some couples go years without a healthy pregnancy while others may never know they have this.

You can see I only recently started getting consistently negative OPKs, and the HPT lines are still there but very faint. These OPKs have a sensitivity of 25miu, meaning if HCG is 25 or higher they'll definitely show positive, and below that it depends on how much LH is present. Some OPKs have a sensitivity of 40 miu, so those may be more reliable with slightly higher HCG levels.

I did wonder if I ovulated on 9/10 because the OPK had been getting darker for a few days and I had EWCM, and my temperatures have been (somewhat inconsistently) increasing since then. Who knows -- we'll see if I have my period in a week or so.

I was still getting faint positives on stick tests, but I stopped bleeding on day 10, counting from first day of miscarriage bleeding. On day 11 I did an LH stick test and got a positive and a very faint positive on an HCG stick test. Day 12 I got another positive LH test and very very faint HCG, so I assumed I had ovulated (I don&#39;t temp.. yet). A week later I got HCG and progesterone blood tests and the HCG was 1.5, the progesterone was 0.3 so doc told me she thought I HADN&#39;T ovulated.</p>

<p>LH tests have been negative every day since, although they did get a little darker for a couple days on days 21 and 22, and I had severe cramps on my right side on day 21 which I usually associate with ovulation. If I get my period in two days, I&#39;ll know I ovulated around day 12.</p>

I figure I’d weigh in on factor V (FVL, or Factor 5, trying to make this searchable in the future for others). I knew I had FVL (heterozygous) because my sister has it. I got tested for it after and my OBGYN recommended avoiding estrogen based birth control. This was all at 22yrs old.

Now I’m 30, and I conceived this year. At the 8 week scan, the heart beat was low and the growth was behind. We found out it was a MMC 2 weeks later. I did not take aspirin or do anything even though my doctor nonchalantly had told me previously it might not hurt. I worried that I caused the issue by not taking the low dose aspirin. He said to do it, but I just didn’t know if I really needed to and didn’t understand the risks and benefits. It’s really hard not to blame ourselves.

I figure I’d weigh in on factor V (FVL, or Factor 5, trying to make this searchable in the future for others). I knew I had FVL (heterozygous) because my sister has it. I got tested for it after and my OBGYN recommended avoiding estrogen based birth control. This was all at 22yrs old.</p>

<p>Now I’m 30, and I conceived this year. At the 8 week scan, the heart beat was low and the growth was behind. We found out it was a MMC 2 weeks later.

He said to do it, but I just didn’t know if I really needed to and didn’t understand the risks and benefits. It’s really hard not to blame ourselves.</p>

Your wife was pregnant, but it's not uncommon for military clinics to disregard early losses. It happened to me in my early 20s, and I was 32 before a doctor said she believed me that I had been pregnant once in my 20s.

It's okay to be sad with her. Figure out a way to get closure together. Plant a rose bush, buy her a necklace with the baby's birthstone, or just release some balloons into the sky.

Let it be a small remembrance of a life that you loved so much. 

Talk to your wife about all the things that hurt... The things you had dreamed of doing. Talk to your wife about trying again one day when you are both physically and mentally healed up. Make a plan for early intervention the next time you try. 

Remind your wife that there was nothing she did that caused the miscarriage. Remind her that her resilience is important, that you don't want to try again until she feels like she's found it again. Tell her that it's okay to dwell in a dark place for a little bit, but that it would be devastating if it also destroyed her. Remind her that recovery from grief is possible, even when complicated by insensitive medical staff, and it is ultimately what your baby would want. If you're into spirituality, tell her a story of your baby's spirit rooting for her.

My SIL who knows about my mc and how long my husband and I have been trying told me she was pregnant, and it was really sweet.  She knew it would be hard for me to hear, and was really kind and gentle about it, and has asked me how I feel, and has asked if I want to know about it/etc.  How is your relationship with your sister?  Would she understand that it's hard for you to hear? 

I think it's important to understand that you can be so happy for her and so sad for you at the same time - both feelings are valid, and even though they seem contradictory, they aren't.  When I found out, I cried.  I was so sad that it wasn't me, that I had to keep trying and I'd been trying longer etc.etc. but, I'm also SO happy for them.

<p>My SIL who knows about my mc and how long my husband and I have been trying told me she was pregnant, and it was really sweet.  She knew it would be hard for me to hear, and was really kind and gentle about it, and has asked me how I feel, and has asked if I want to know about it/etc.  How is your relationship with your sister?

I haven't been in the same exact situation, but am in something alike. We lost our daughter in February, in the 27th week of pregnancy, due to a hypercoiled umbilical chord. My brother and his wife gave birth to their lovely son in April. So the way, I recognize the situation is in regards to my own family. They were of course marked by our loss, and divided between this and happiness for the birth of my nephew. Even so, it didn't take long for them to sort of ""forget"" the grief, and only focus on the new addition to the family. 

To be honest, I don't have the best of relationship with my own parents, but still - I have been disappointed of how the rest of my family and they've acted since the birth of my nephew. When we have a family gathering - which there are a lot of now with a grandchild - I/we never want to be there. It is my mothers first grandchild, and she's all over him. Taking pictures of him when he sleeps, only to come out and put it in my face, saying ""look at this blanket, which you slept in when you were his size, blablabla"". Only reminding me of what my daughter is missing and that she's not here. When my mother does this I do say ""mom, this is really hard for me to look at"", with the tears almost running. Even with me saying so, and the look on my face, she doesn't put it away or go to someone else. 

My grandmother, whom I've always loved very dearly, the last time I saw her, asked me ""is it still as bad"", regarding how I felt about our loss. In addition she at one point said ""maybe it was for the best, that your daughter didn't survive"". Now she's soon to be 92, so I'm trying to give her some slack for these things, but are having a very hard time doing so. In the situation, I'm being honest about my feelings and I explained that nothing was wrong with our daughter, and it was most definitely NOT for the best. I must admit I'm still very resentful towards her atm. 

My nephews parents are great and understanding towards my husband and I, but it takes a toll on us to be around the rest of my family. 

*To try to answer your question:*   
I would always try to be honest. Even if they would react harshly towards your honesty, at least you have been honest to yourselves. Of course you can discuss how honest you should be, and try to say something in a ""nice"" way.   
How to address it in a nice way could be next time they put a photo in your faces. Say something alike ""I can see that you're very happy, and I'm happy that you are. But what you're doing is actually hurting my feelings atm"". If you feel like having a break from pictures and such, this could be added. I don't know if this helps, but as I said: true towards your own feelings. I believe this is the best way to find some sort of peace in your own mind, and if they can't understand this - well to be honest, I would try to not see them for some time.

She also said baby aspirin wouldn’t go astray for increased blood flow.</p>

 I think despite what direction the numbers are going in I think we’re all going through a similar mental struggle of trying to cope.
I have a history with anorexia/ bulimia and while I hadn’t engaged in any negative food related habits in 6 years as soon as I lost my son it all came back.

I was punishing myself for what happened to my son and trying to find control. The next thing she told me was that if I want to get pregnant again not eating and smoking was absolutely not going to get me there.
I joined a gym and It took a few weeks for me to adjust my eating habits, and I still have bad days where I back slide but now that I have a goal, or a reason to concentrate on being healthy it helps keep me accountable.

I don’t believe in scales ( I do blind weigh ins at doctors) I get really fixated on the number and let the number control me and I think there is more to my health then that one number. I can’t tell you how to instantly reach your goal but I can tell you what helped me get back to having a healthy relationship with my body was finding that motivating reason to focus on health and after identifying that things like getting exercise and making nutritious meals came a lot easier.

That’s when after committing to get healthy again I started working with a trainer and she had me decrease my cardio and start weight training 3-4 times a week and after a few months everything is tighter than before.
