This is my new username (formerly /u/infertilitythrowaway). I wanted to explain my new name, because it has a lot of meaning for me.

After our first loss, we donated a children's book to our public library in memory of the baby. The head children's librarian picked out a book she thought would be good: [*Hi, Koo!: A Year of Seasons*](http://www.amazon.com/Hi-Koo-Seasons-Jon-Muth/dp/0545166683/) by Jon Muth; it's a book of haiku for kids. A little bookplate was put in the front cover; it says ""Presented to [library] in memory of Baby [last initial]. Love, Mama, Dada, and [#1]."" The thing that let me know that *this* was the perfect choice for us was in the author's intro: ""Haiku is like an instant captured in words."" This is what I wanted--the brief time of my pregnancy, memorialized with the book. It was really meaningful to me to eventually go to the library and read the book. It was a way for me to do something positive with the loss, contribute to a cause I believe in (yay, early literacy!), and ensure our baby isn't forgotten. Whenever I check the book's status online, it is checked out, so I know people are reading and enjoying it, and that makes me happy.

Anyway, a while ago I asked the librarians to pick out a book we can donate in memory of our second loss, and they emailed me back this morning with their choice: [*Bluebird*](http://www.amazon.com/Bluebird-Lindsey-Yankey/dp/1927018331/) by Lindsey Yankey. I've asked that this one's bookplate read: ""Presented to [library] in loving memory of Baby [nickname] by Mama, Dada, and [#1]. We will always wonder where your wings could have taken you.""

In the midst of trying to hold back tears while confirming with them that this book is a good choice, I realized that the two books together make a good new username for me. They capture my sadness at our losses, my love for all our babies, and my hope for our future.

What I eventually had to realise (no idea if this helps or not), is that:

- I am still me and can pretend/forget that I am pregnant for a day or a few hours, and that is completely okay and healthy, mentally, to relax and be JUST me. 

- That pregnancy lasts a lot longer than I realised at the beginning, and I eventually had to learn to relax and let go of the anxiety and urgency to get everything done asap, and let go of the mental ""waiting"". Feeling like everything is on hold indefinitely is very taxing.

- I had to stop obsessing over the pregnancy. This meant I had to stop constantly talking about it, put down the phone (babybumps, apps, articles, YouTube vids). I had to cut down on mommy Facebook groups and and constant baby shopping. I had to avoid the baby section for a while if I went into the store. Just give yourself breaks. Plan a normal adult conversation that doesn't involve pregnancy with your friends/SO. 

This also meant I had to stop texting my SO at work every time I had a gas bubble or cramp or worry or new fact. I had to ignore the constant diaper commercials, the nursery, the belly, for short periods of time.

- I had to come to the realisation that IF something happens, there really isn't much I can do about it, that I am doing everything right, and that being less stressed about it is healthier for the pregnancy and myself.

- I had to trust/respect myself as an adult and person, that IF something was wrong I WOULD take appropriate measures (ER, see my doc, etc), and that I can relax and trust myself until if/when that happened. 

And I found that after the anatomy scan, I relaxed a huge amount, and really did start to enjoy it after I knew things were healthy. After that each week is closer to ""safe"", so that is why as time goes on towards the end, it is easier to relax and let go and enjoy things.

She is a 6 month old rat terrier-dachsund (and maybe something else) mix. We adopted her about three weeks after my surgery for ectopic pregnancy. At first, I was overwhelmed with raising her, as she was 11 weeks old when she came home, but she is the friendliest, sweetest, cuddliest little dog I've ever had, but she's also wildly confident with quite the attitude.

She loves to run and play at the dog park when it's warm enough: http://imgur.com/5jXS8SR

She's also little and still chews and gets into mischief, like the occasional murder of an innocent toy: http://imgur.com/MyMUwti and finding things of her mom's to chew on without hiding the evidence very well: http://imgur.com/MGTHmnq

She's never boring and has given me a reason to get out of bed on my worst of days over the past few months. If you're ever in western Iowa, she'd love to meet you, because she loves people and giving kisses.

She is a 6 month old rat terrier-dachsund (and maybe something else) mix. We adopted her about three weeks after my surgery for ectopic pregnancy. At first, I was overwhelmed with raising her, as she was 11 weeks old when she came home, but she is the friendliest, sweetest, cuddliest little dog I&#39;ve ever had, but she&#39;s also wildly confident with quite the attitude.</p>

<p>She loves to run and play at the dog park when it&#39;s warm enough: <a href=""http://imgur.com/5jXS8SR"">http://imgur.com/5jXS8SR</a></p>

<p>She&#39;s also little and still chews and gets into mischief, like the occasional murder of an innocent toy: <a href=""http://imgur.com/MyMUwti"">http://imgur.com/MyMUwti</a> and finding things of her mom&#39;s to chew on without hiding the evidence very well: <a href=""http://imgur.com/MGTHmnq"">http://imgur.com/MGTHmnq</a></p>

http://imgur.com/J9jMRoJ

The brown tabby, Gus, and grey cat, Ella which is short for Ellaphant (she chose her own name) were the first two cats we adopted when we moved in together. Shortly after we had to watch my sister's cat when she moved into an apartment that didn't allow cats. I was iffy about having 3 cats but it worked really well. 

One day we were picking up food at a pet store when we saw the multi-colored cat, Penelope, up for adoption, she was so tiny and cute but very unusual as she is a polydactyl and has 7 toes on her front paw and 5 on her back. We were worried about adopting her at first since we thought she was more likely to get sick but after researching we found that it's not that uncommon in cats to have the extra toes. After two days of thinking about her we took the plunge and put in an application for her. 

A little while later my sister took her cat back and my husband decided we should adopt another cat since we had been used to having four cats. We went to the SPCA and found the Orange cat, Ralph, and immediately fell in love. He was an older cat, 5 years old, and he is so talkative. He completed our perfect family. 

Here are some bonus pics of my sister kitty sitting while we were on our honeymoon, it was hard to be away from them for a week:

She goes on to say that she learned to be comfortable and happy with her pregnancy. So its a hopeful story, But she says little of how she got to this point.

I started Femara today and am feeling hopeful about this cycle. My plan for the rest of the weekend is to sit around watching Netflix (with an old blanket I don&#39;t care about between my pants and the couch!).</p>

[Lots of triggers - Infant loss]

And then when my son was born he almost died at birth. They saved him though, and so I got to take him home! It was THEN that I said okay, now I can relax, and be happy, everything is done and I can enjoy my baby. 

Then he got that fever and we took him to the ER and they said jaundice and I was so worried, but they put him under the lamps and he got better and they sent me home saying he is perfectly healthy. So I relaxed again.

And the next day he saw the doctor for an exam and had gained back the weight and was healthy as can be, they said. So I was like Okay NOW, finally, I can relax, everything is fixed.

And then, that night, he seized in my arms and never woke up. Heart stopped in the ER twice but they resuscitated him. Hooked him up to tubes, put him in a special bed, and flew him away to the best hospital in the country. I thought, okay, they saved him, now it will be the long haul to recovery, maybe some brain damage, but he will live.

And then finding out two days later that his brain is completely destroyed and rotted, essentially. That he will not live.

[End Triggers]

So, for me, the triggers are very...different. It isn't diaper commercials, it's that red cross commercial where the baby with the breathing tube gets to come home. It's not seeing a baby in a stroller, it's having an ambulance drive by. Then I am completely gone into a flashback and relive that scene again. And again. And again.

My relative posted on Facebook a series of pictures of a dying baby (one of those ""raise awareness to help so and so's baby"" things). The baby was alive in the pics (barely, to be frank), but looked how my son looked as he died. So then I am gone from this world and relive his death for half an hour before I manage to wake up enough to take an adivan and try to sleep.

Not sure what I'm trying to say, mostly trying to feel like I can share here. Just for me there is no ""safe"" point. I don't know how I will raise a child. I don't know how I would ever sleep, I couldn't possibly risk not watching them. 

But, at the same time, just enjoy what time you have with your pregnancy or baby. Feel as much love as possible.

Anyway, sorry, not sure what my point was. Hopefully didn't make anyone upset or depressed, NOT my intention. But I understand the petty trigger things entirely. Don't feel bad about them at all.

I thought, okay, they saved him, now it will be the long haul to recovery, maybe some brain damage, but he will live.</p>

<p>And then finding out two days later that his brain is completely destroyed and rotted, essentially. That he will not live.</p>

<p>[End Triggers]</p>

<p>So, for me, the triggers are very...different. It isn&#39;t diaper commercials, it&#39;s that red cross commercial where the baby with the breathing tube gets to come home. It&#39;s not seeing a baby in a stroller, it&#39;s having an ambulance drive by. Then I am completely gone into a flashback and relive that scene again. And again. And again.</p>

<p>My relative posted on Facebook a series of pictures of a dying baby (one of those &quot;raise awareness to help so and so&#39;s baby&quot; things). The baby was alive in the pics (barely, to be frank), but looked how my son looked as he died. So then I am gone from this world and relive his death for half an hour before I manage to wake up enough to take an adivan and try to sleep.</p>

<p>Not sure what I&#39;m trying to say, mostly trying to feel like I can share here. Just for me there is no &quot;safe&quot; point. I don&#39;t know how I will raise a child. I don&#39;t know how I would ever sleep, I couldn&#39;t possibly risk not watching them. </p>

<p>But, at the same time, just enjoy what time you have with your pregnancy or baby. Feel as much love as possible.</p>

<p>Anyway, sorry, not sure what my point was. Hopefully didn&#39;t make anyone upset or depressed, NOT my intention. But I understand the petty trigger things entirely. Don&#39;t feel bad about them at all. I really, really get it.</p>

She has all the same fears we do, but comes at it from an angle that just irks me. First of all, we aren't 'morbid' for having these concerns. This is serious business, and few things can quiet those fears, especially statistics. Once you have found yourself in that 1% who has multiple  losses in a row, stats start looking pretty hollow.

I don't know why exactly this sets me off, but it does. I can't tell if I'm angry that she's co-opting fears she has no experience with, or if I'm angry that she has every opportunity/reason to *have* a blissful ignorant pregnancy (which we cannot) and she's choosing to worry instead.

<p>She has all the same fears we do, but comes at it from an angle that just irks me. First of all, we aren&#39;t &#39;morbid&#39; for having these concerns. This is serious business, and few things can quiet those fears, especially statistics. Once you have found yourself in that 1% who has multiple  losses in a row, stats start looking pretty hollow.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t know why exactly this sets me off, but it does. I can&#39;t tell if I&#39;m angry that she&#39;s co-opting fears she has no experience with, or if I&#39;m angry that she has every opportunity/reason to <em>have</em> a blissful ignorant pregnancy (which we cannot) and she&#39;s choosing to worry instead. </p>

<p>I think I&#39;m just in a bad mood today.</p>

My child that was planned for, and loved, and that we are ready for. </p>

<p>I also know that just because ours is planned that doesn&#39;t make her baby any less loved or worthy of being born, so then I feel like an asshole because at the end of the day, there&#39;s a beautiful baby boy about to make his entrance into the world and it&#39;s hard to be mad about that (most of the time). Plus she is totally in love with him already. I&#39;m a douchebag.</p>

We've talked about it a bit in the past, but with everything that happened, it got put on the backburner. I'm just not sure what to do. Warning, wall of text.

Backstory - we're from San Diego and he still works down there, but we moved to a nearby county 2 years ago so we could afford a big new house with a yard for our future family, and I could be a stay-at-home mom. We thought this new city would be like... Young Family Mecca. At first the commute was averaging about 45 minutes to an hour, but lately it's been taking closer to an hour and a half for him to get home because of traffic. He's usually gone from 8am-7pm because of this and the drive is wiping him out. We're both concerned that the commute is going to get worse (especially because of a big traffic and housing development about to start construction near his work), and he's barely going to see the baby because he/she will be in bed by the time he gets home.

I REALLY, really like our house. It's spacious, everything is shiny and new, and we have a big yard.. although we don't use it nearly as much as I thought we would. The city we live in is... okay. I thought I would like it more. It's very safe, cookie-cutter suburban, filled with tons of big box stores and blonde Mormon housewives. I haven't really made any friends up here because everyone has kids, but I expect it'll be easier once we have a baby. I'm not sure how well I'll mesh with the types of moms around here, though.

I really miss San Diego. All my family lives there, there's tons of stuff to do, and the weather is nicer. Yeah, we can drive down there on the weekends, but it's a long drive and after commuting all week, my husband never wants to. But if we moved back, there's NO way we could afford anything like what we have now. Our house would probably cost 3x as much if it was located in SD.

We have equity in this house because we bought at the right time, and I think if we sold it, we could make around $75k on it. On the flip side, I think the value might increase even more if we waited a couple years (but the cost of buying might go up, too). But if we wanted to buy in San Diego, we'd be looking at older townhomes that need some work, with shared walls and maybe a small patch of grass and a patio. I LOVE having a freestanding house, especially because of the yard for my dogs and the lack of noise from neighbors, but I don't think we could afford one down there for at least 5-10 years.. maybe never? On the plus side, I think his commute could be cut at least in half, maybe down to 30 minutes. And we'd be closer to family and all the stuff SD offers. But do I really want to downsize like that?

I guess I need to weigh the pros and cons of moving. I'm also not sure if it'd be easier to try to do this now, or wait until we have a baby already. I feel like I might feel even more isolated up here when we do have a baby - my husband and mom will always be 1 to 1.5 hours away. And it will be harder to go through the process of moving with an infant.

It's confusing for me, because everything seemed so normal with my son; it didn't happen the first cycle we tried or anything, but it was within a ""normal"" range. I had no idea how lucky we were. I don't know if it was just a fluke that the first time went so well or if something has changed in my body between then and now. We're officially ""infertile"" now, though I'm hoping someday we can get lucky again.

Your husband loves you and wants you to be healthy so it seems like you both can make some positive changes in both of your lives together. Having someone to lean on during this process is going to be key. Start by making small goals for yourself. Like cutting out soda and cooking more meals at home.

You can also find activities that you and your husband can do together (If you want) like walking, running, weightlifting (that's what DH and I do) or any sport really.

The only surefire way to know you are ovulating is to temp. When you O, the egg is released from the ovary with a ""shell""-the corpus luteum. It's the corpus luteum (along with shifts in other hormones tracked by opks) that triggers progesterone surge which triggers a temperature rise.

That means you can get cm/cp changes, positive opks, cramping, sore boobs, and even ovary pain, but unless you see a sustained rise in temperature, you can't know if you actually O'ed or fired a blank.

<p>It&#39;s very frustrating and disappointing. It might be worth talking to your doctor about going on birth control, it seems to have sorted me out.</p>

Last night just could not have been worse. Ended up having a huge fight with my husband and I can't even really understand why. I got an almost-positive OPK last night so I did a bit of light flirting and asked if we could have sex tomorrow (we have only had actual sex once since the miscarriage - not my choice but hey, I respect his space). Husband told me nope because he was working tomorrow and would be too tired. He has 3 hours of classes. I was kind of surprised but let it drop.

Later I tried to calmly bring it up and explain to him that I'd had a really difficult few months with the pregnancy and miscarriage and everything else. That I had been charting and taking all kinds of pills and getting blood tests just because I want to give us the best shot. After that I was going to say that there was such a narrow window for conception that it would mean a lot to me if we could just have sex for these couple of days and enjoy it, you know, but he didn't even let me finish the sentence and just flipped out. Said that charting and prenatals and everything was 'my choice' and my fault and that basically he thought it was idiotic that I was believing what I read online about conception. Then he asked if I was getting medical information online and I said 'no', because I listen to my doctor. He instantly got furious and claimed that I was 'lying' to him because I had mentioned HCG in a question to my doctor and bought PreSeed lubricant once. At this point I'm thinking what the actual fuck.

He has this huge bee in his bonnet about how everything I read online is somehow unreliable even if there are scientific studies to back it up because the scientific studies 'could be wrong'. I'm just like, hey, it makes me feel more in control of a shitty situation if I can do research and better understand what is going on with my body. It's not like I am acting on anything without talking to my doctor and doing what is best for me. I just like being armed with information since my doctors really let me down by not looking into my thyroid issues (or even warning me it might be a problem) when I originally told them I was TTC. If I had known then what I know now, things might have been very different.

He keeps on bringing up the fact that some girls in my pregnancy group suggested that I should go to the ER when I started bleeding/miscarrying because I was scared and couldn't get a hold of my doctor (I didn't, but I raised it as an option to him at the time). Apparently that means that my intellectual standards are now compromised in his eyes since I 'overreacted' by considering going to the ER when miscarrying, and he therefore feels the need to go on hour-long rants about how I have to learn to analyse evidence better. Personally I don't see how it would have been a problem even if we had made a trip to the ER...but we didn't even do that. I just took some suggestions from people who have been in similar situations into account when considering what to do in a very stressful situation.

Anyway, I don't know where all this is coming from. Clearly he has some issues around what happened with the pregnancy and is lashing out. I feel ready to try again but I don't know where the hell his head is at. Usually we can communicate about these kinds of things without arguments, but last night just got vicious. I just don't even know where we go from here. Counseling, maybe?

After that I was going to say that there was such a narrow window for conception that it would mean a lot to me if we could just have sex for these couple of days and enjoy it, you know, but he didn&#39;t even let me finish the sentence and just flipped out. Said that charting and prenatals and everything was &#39;my choice&#39; and my fault and that basically he thought it was idiotic that I was believing what I read online about conception. Then he asked if I was getting medical information online and I said &#39;no&#39;, because I listen to my doctor. He instantly got furious and claimed that I was &#39;lying&#39; to him because I had mentioned HCG in a question to my doctor and bought PreSeed lubricant once. At this point I&#39;m thinking what the actual fuck.</p>

<p>He has this huge bee in his bonnet about how everything I read online is somehow unreliable even if there are scientific studies to back it up because the scientific studies &#39;could be wrong&#39;. I&#39;m just like, hey, it makes me feel more in control of a shitty situation if I can do research and better understand what is going on with my body. It&#39;s not like I am acting on anything without talking to my doctor and doing what is best for me. I just like being armed with information since my doctors really let me down by not looking into my thyroid issues (or even warning me it might be a problem) when I originally told them I was TTC. If I had known then what I know now, things might have been very different.</p>

<p>He keeps on bringing up the fact that some girls in my pregnancy group suggested that I should go to the ER when I started bleeding/miscarrying because I was scared and couldn&#39;t get a hold of my doctor (I didn&#39;t, but I raised it as an option to him at the time). Apparently that means that my intellectual standards are now compromised in his eyes since I &#39;overreacted&#39; by considering going to the ER when miscarrying, and he therefore feels the need to go on hour-long rants about how I have to learn to analyse evidence better. Personally I don&#39;t see how it would have been a problem even if we had made a trip to the ER...but we didn&#39;t even do that. I just took some suggestions from people who have been in similar situations into account when considering what to do in a very stressful situation.</p>

<p>Anyway, I don&#39;t know where all this is coming from. Clearly he has some issues around what happened with the pregnancy and is lashing out. I feel ready to try again but I don&#39;t know where the hell his head is at. Usually we can communicate about these kinds of things without arguments, but last night just got vicious. I just don&#39;t even know where we go from here. Counseling, maybe? I&#39;m just not sure how much more drama and angst I can deal with in my life right now.</p>

Last May I got my master's degree in education. It was a career change for me from insurance (disability claims) to education.

I got a great evaluation and recommendation, but my cooperating teacher basically threw me into the classroom with no guidance so she could kick back for 16 weeks.

So, surgery, misery, many tears later, we decided not to move since we were referred to the RE for my endometriosis and I was horribly depressed. I kept putting off finding work because I just couldn't stomach a classroom full of kids. 

Well, now, we're pregnant and I don't know what to do. I want to work because I want my husband to be able to leave his oilfield job so he can be home with me after the baby comes.

Even though I have tons of experience and a graduate degree, I feel like I'm not qualified or capable of doing any paying job. I'm really scared I guess. Thoughts are welcome.

Exhaustion. All-day nausea. Constipation. Congestion. Weird headaches. Random crying jags. Dizziness. And now wild and unpredictable mood swings.

I have been really fatigued the past two days...feeling like I can&#39;t muster the energy to do anything. And I have a new type of headache which is making me feel crazy. </p>

<p>I know it will end, but right now it is really getting me down. I am overjoyed to be pregnant. SO SO excited!! But I feel like I can&#39;t actively enjoy it since I feel like I am getting run over by a truck all day. </p>

Maybe, if you can't see a doctor earlier (or think that might not ease your anxiety anyway), maybe you can find a grief counselor? I saw one after my dad died, and the coping mechanisms I learned there have *really* helped me manage my feeling around mc, and the unknowns of being pregnant now. It doesn't make the feelings stop, and it doesn't make you suddenly happy, but it can help you find a way to accept that these difficult feelings will come on occasion, and let them pass through you with less damage, ultimately diminishing some of their overwhelming power.

I've posted before about Tara Brach and R.A.I.N. She's a meditation teacher who talks about a way to let painful thoughts pass by. I know it sounds cheesy, but it's been a life saver for me. There's a podcast about RAIN that's about 45 minutes. I've listened to it a million times. It helps me find some peace when waves of grief crash over me with no warning.

 Losing a child is the worst thing that could ever happen and it's perfectly natural to feel anxious, panicked and to shield yourself against feeling that again. It's okay to feel all the emotions and it's okay to not feel anything and picture anything just yet. Your are still grieving for Oliver. The daydreaming can come alter, or not at all. It's okay.

<p>Losing a child is the worst thing that could ever happen and it&#39;s perfectly natural to feel anxious, panicked and to shield yourself against feeling that again. It&#39;s okay to feel all the emotions and it&#39;s okay to not feel anything and picture anything just yet. Your are still grieving for Oliver. The daydreaming can come alter, or not at all.

I need to just vent. 

A few hours ago I was getting settled in bed and all of a sudden I had these shooting pains from my lower pelvis down through my vagina, like someone was stabbing me from the inside. I turned over and they kept happening for about 5 minutes. This sent me into a hysterical sobbing fit of thinking that I'm going to miscarry or the pregnancy is ectopic. 

My husband tried to calm me down and reassure me but it didn't work very well. I am just so scared of losing this baby. I don't think I could handle another loss, I feel like it would break me. I don't think I'd be able to try again if it happened. Then I started thinking about losing Oliver and for a few minutes I felt exactly like I did when we got our diagnosis. Just absolutely devastated, sobbing, the worst feelings I've ever felt. It's like I was projecting that past experience onto this baby. Like I was having a flashback that I couldn't stop. For a few minutes I honestly thought I was carrying Oliver again. 

I finally calmed down and snapped back to reality a bit and STUPIDLY went into the bathroom and took another Clearblue Weeks Estimator. It said 3+ the other day, but tonight it said 2-3. Cue even more freaking out and hysterical sobbing. I didn't tell my husband about it but I spent some time googling the tests. I knew my urine was probably pretty diluted but it's like I was using the test to justify my feeling that this pregnancy won't work. 

That was a few hours ago. I held my pee since then and (stupidly, again) just took my last Weeks Estimator. My pee looked much darker and less dilute than earlier. It said 3+ again. I'm a fucking idiot for taking that first test because it was totally inaccurate. But this doesn't make me feel much better either because I feel like I could lose this pregnancy at any moment and I have no control over anything that happens. The weeks estimator doesn't mean shit, really. 

I just don't know how I'm going to get through all of this. Everyone keeps telling me to take it one day at a time, and I'm *trying*, but it's so hard. I hate that I have to feel this way. I just want to get to my first appointment and ultrasound because I feel like at this point I don't even know if there's a living baby in there. I'm hoping it's a little easier after that but I won't be surprised if it isn't. 

When I was pregnant with Oliver, before we got bad news, I'd spend all day daydreaming about what he'd be like as a baby and a child and then an adult. But now when I try to think about this baby I can't picture anything. Like I just can't picture myself as a mother to a living child, I just keep seeing either black nothingness or a dead baby. I'm afraid I wouldn't even know what to do if I did have a live baby. Like I'd be a terrible, clueless mother and maybe I'm not cut out for this.

I know it&#39;s hard. Eat some chocolate and do something nice for yourself today. </p>

- eat high-fat, high protein foods, and salty foods. Crackers shouldn't be your go-to solution (despite frequent advice) since carbs can exacerbate the problem. They are fine to get something in there and provide immediate relief, but they won't solve the problem. Try to get some peanut/almond butter or cheese down with them.

- eat frequently despite not wanting to. Eat first thing after waking up before you realize you are hungry. Eat before you find yourself getting hungry (even if that means just a few almonds or a banana before finding something real to eat).

- smoothies with yogurt, dates/prunes, bananas and almond milk are good. And they help with what might be coming next: indigestion and constipation. 

- get Reed's Ginger chew candies, ginger beer, and/or ginger tea. Ginger really does help.

- when you feel nauseous in public, press *really* hard on your wrist (about two inches above the heel of your palm between the two small tendons there). *really hard* - like dig in there. It's a pressure point that should give some relief (it's helped me avoid throwing up while teaching, and while on the train).

I&#39;ve had a solid week of nausea so far. I&#39;ve found a few ways to deal with it:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>eat high-fat, high protein foods, and salty foods. Crackers shouldn&#39;t be your go-to solution (despite frequent advice) since carbs can exacerbate the problem. They are fine to get something in there and provide immediate relief, but they won&#39;t solve the problem. Try to get some peanut/almond butter or cheese down with them.</p></li>
<li><p>eat frequently despite not wanting to. Eat first thing after waking up before you realize you are hungry. Eat before you find yourself getting hungry (even if that means just a few almonds or a banana before finding something real to eat).</p></li>
<li><p>smoothies with yogurt, dates/prunes, bananas and almond milk are good. And they help with what might be coming next: indigestion and constipation. </p></li>
<li><p>get Reed&#39;s Ginger chew candies, ginger beer, and/or ginger tea. Ginger really does help.</p></li>
<li><p>when you feel nauseous in public, press <em>really</em> hard on your wrist (about two inches above the heel of your palm between the two small tendons there). <em>really hard</em> - like dig in there. It&#39;s a pressure point that should give some relief (it&#39;s helped me avoid throwing up while teaching, and while on the train).</p></li>
</ul>

It's _always_ on my mind. Here are my mental ramblings of recent. 

We've been oscillating between using protection (my choice) or not (his choice) this month. Ive been feeling like I can't handle being pregnant, he thinks I can. We have decided to compromise instead on the whole just wing it, no charting or opks, have sex for fun only thing instead. 

The thing is, at this point, I don't need to do any of that. I have a pretty good idea of when I'm fertile. It's around now, and suddenly, today I feel like I can totally do this, that I'm completely ready to be pregnant again, that I *can* deal with whatever gets thrown my way.

I'm wondering if my confidence is being inspired by hormones, or if I actually don't need to take time off from trying to get pregnant.

Either way, I read something yesterday saying that the type of fibroid that I have (pedunculated submucosal) lowers your chances of implantation by 50% so I have a feeling that I really shouldn't take a month off, because if we haven't managed to conceive in six months of trying, my fibroid should be reassessed and removed. So if we do take time off, that means it will be closer to a year before we will likely be able to conceive again given the recovery time after having the fibroid removed. 

I really hope that we can just conceive without removing the fibroid though. The myomectomy makes me nervous, esp. since the one that I had just over a year ago damaged my cervix, and since it will require yet another d&c and I have a fear of Asherman's syndrome after spending too much time on google. 

Okay, rambling over, I feel better getting this out. I shall leave all anxiety here in this post and focus on making the most out of the rest of my day.

There are two things I did that I think could have caused it.

1.  **Skin care products.**  I see an esthetician for my acne and she has her own line of skincare products.  I told her I was pregnant as soon as I got my BFP and she assured me all of the products I was using were safe for pregnancy.  I did not do my own research on the ingredients or consult my OB.  The other day my esthetician was trying to comfort me about my miscarriage, and she told me that she has had ""a bunch"" of clients who were pregnant, and about half of them miscarried.  My heart sunk when she said that.  Considering that is far above the average miscarriage rate, I couldn't help but wonder if there was a causal relationship between the products and miscarriage.


2.  **Throat Coat Tea.**  I had a really bad cold for a week during my pregnancy.  I wanted to refrain from using any medicine but drink a ton of Throat Coat tea.  Maybe 3-4 cups a day for 4 or 5 days.  I was just reading in a thread here the other day about things not to take/do while pregnant, and licorice was one.  Organic Licorice Root is the first ingredient in that stupid tea.  And there are other herbs that could be bad too, I haven't brought myself to look each of them up.  Of course it says on the tea box to check with a doctor if you are pregnant or nursing, but I assumed that was a boilerplate warning.  Now I feel like it wasn't and I should have listened.


Obviously what's done is done and feeling like it could have been my fault doesn't help anything.  My mind just keeps ending back here.  Like deep down, I know it was my fault.
