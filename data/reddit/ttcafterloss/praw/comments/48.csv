Really glad we even got one attempt in. Fiance is on an SSRI that's made it difficult, but he needs it and it helps him.

I've been on prenatals, iron, and a few others for about six weeks now. I've been drinking more water, trying to reduce stress...pretty much the whole nine yards.

Should know by Halloween how this worked out. This is our 2nd month TTC since my MC in May. If this month fails, we have to stop trying for a few months. Moving house next year during the due date window for November and December 2017 conception.

Due date for my MCed son is December 7th. Dreading it, pregnant or not. I feel sort of bad that I think it'll be easier if I'm pregnant though. 

I mentioned to my fiance that some ladies here got birthstone jewelry for their lost little ones. So I am getting a necklace for my Jude. Very comforted by the thought of that.

One weird thought I had is that if we were to get pregnant around 3 months out, and if it's viable (a new conditional statement I mentally add every time I think about a next pregnancy now üòë), we could have a baby around the anniversary of losing this one. Which might make October 13th next year slightly less painful, though I'm not sure I'll ever not be sad about it.

I think I'd just be really happy and really sad all at once. 

On a related note, the complexity of emotions around all of this is like nothing I've ever experienced. 

^This. You hit the nail right on the head here. Some days you will feel fine, some days it will feel like you're going through too much emotional pain to handle.  I miscarried a blighted ovum at 6 weeks (which I call a wanna-be baby rather than a 'real' baby) and it took me over two months sort my shit even the slightest amount. It's 3 months post and I just got an ultrasound yesterday to confirm everything is back to normal all up in there.  I don't want to imagine how much harder it would be if you have to go through a delivery. 

My advice is to try not to put timelines on anything right now. Timelines are mental terrorism for me because I tell my self all the things I was 'suppose to' be doing now if I was pregnant since I planned it all out.  Just take the feelings as they come, hour by hour, and wait for a while before you decide how you feel. The emotional roller coaster is unpredictable beast.

<p>I&#39;m all about avoiding potential BFNs at times when they could be extra damaging (and I&#39;m 36 with time breathing down my neck), so if you feel like it&#39;ll be easier to skate through the holidays without the extra stress I&#39;d say skip it!</p>

It‚Äôs helpful to know other people have gone through the same thing and made the same decision. I‚Äôm sorry you went through this as well. 

I understand when you say everyone implied you were making the right decision. It seemed as though they were all silently trying to persuade me to the same one but at the end of all of their information they seemed to feel it was necessary to add in ‚Äúbut it could just go away!‚Äù. My husband said they kind of needed to do that to remain politically correct but it planted a tiny seed that maybe she could be ok. I know in my heart that is probably not true. I thought the last doctor said the fluid on her belly wasn‚Äôt significant but my husband says I heard her wrong because she followed up by saying there is a layer all around her under her skin which based on my research is a very dire prognosis.

I‚Äôm not sure if twilight sedation is an option. I‚Äôve been told by a couple different people that you get put under and by some that your sedated but not asleep. I guess we‚Äôll see on Wednesday. I was told to expect to be in the clinic for 5-6 hours so I‚Äôm thinking I‚Äôll be put to sleep.

<p>I understand when you say everyone implied you were making the right decision. It seemed as though they were all silently trying to persuade me to the same one but at the end of all of their information they seemed to feel it was necessary to add in ‚Äúbut it could just go away!‚Äù. My husband said they kind of needed to do that to remain politically correct but it planted a tiny seed that maybe she could be ok. I know in my heart that is probably not true. I thought the last doctor said the fluid on her belly wasn‚Äôt significant but my husband says I heard her wrong because she followed up by saying there is a layer all around her under her skin which based on my research is a very dire prognosis.</p>

But now, as the wedding approaches, a handful of genuine tragedies have made it so none of the out of country family can come (my cousin's FIL was killed in a car crash this week, and the fires in N Cal have pushed air quality low, so my aunt with health problems and the youngest babies are advised not to attend the outdoor wedding). 

I am absolutely devastated for my cousin's wife, her father was a wonderful person and this is so unexpected, I'm crushed for the people in the North Bay who have lost everything. I feel utterly guilty at the idea of being relieved that this wedding will be a little easier for me.

I TFMR'd for this same diagnosis and prognosis earlier this year. I understand the grief and the guilt. It helped me to know that at the end of the day I was taking on the suffering so that my baby would not have to experience it, or so that I would not have to experience it down the road when I was further along in the pregnancy. What also helped was the reactions of my care providers. I am in the largest medical center in the world and saw many different highly respected providers (my OB, the MFM who did my CVS, two different genetic counselors, the doctor who performed the procedure) and all of them, without explicitly saying so, acknowledged that I was doing the right thing. This was not a good prognosis. I would not wish this terrible decision on my worst enemy, but I know it was the right choice. 

I chose to do the procedure with only twilight sedation and my experience was not bad at all. (I topped off with a Xanax too, though.) From other posts here, I can see that it varies from person to person. I barely remember the procedure and did not feel any pain. I listened to my iPod and my entire appointment lasted less than an hour, including recovery. I second the recommendation for the Babycenter TFMR board...the ladies there are very kind.

<p>It&#39;s only after this third loss that he gets that I need handling very carefully, to be honest. </p>

Today I had a great day at work. Lots of planning and collegial discussion (teacher - student free day!) 

A close colleague of mind told me today she has been really tired lately. That and her being accompanied by her hubby to a coffee meeting post doctors appointment (last week) got me asking her ... you're pregnant!? She totally is. 5W so she is cautious and not telling anyone-with the exception of a close few.

I am thrilled for her. She has PCOS and has been trying for a while (initially confided in me when she started and shared her troubles).

I didn't get time to tell her of my MC so I did briefly in our discussion. Probably not in the best way but we were time poor, hushed and hurried. We are catching up properly tomorrow afternoon. 

What got me was how bloody happy I am for her. No twinge of jealousy or anything!!! I think this is a great step forward for me.

In other news, my ovulation test smiled at me this afternoon. I sent a pic of the smiling ovulation test and DH replies - is that preg or ovulating? Bless his heart. 

I'm in for some super fun BDing. AM and PM for the next 48 hours. I don't want to miss out on an Xmas announcement to family! 

Fingers crossed!

My post:

Another year, another October 15th: Pregnancy and Infant Loss Remembrance Day. 

Last year I posted about my miscarriage. This year my mind is on all the people I've met online who form my support network around pregnancy loss (and infertility). Next January will mark two years since my loss, and I still find myself holding back on talking about what's going on in my head, because this is on my mind in one way or another every day, multiple times. 

And that's where the other people I've met online (and in person!) who've had losses come in. I do a lot of my coping via reading what others have gone through, and sharing my own story. Although pregnancy loss has affected people I know, it can be an awkward thing to bring up face to face after the initial ""Me too"" conversations. 

There's all sorts of little communities on the internet for people who've had losses, and one in particular has become a virtual home of mine. On a daily basis new people join, and we say that we're sorry that they're with us, but given what's happened, we're glad that they've found us. Our members have experienced a wide range of losses that other people might find tempting to rank in order of severity. There are those who have had a single ""chemical pregnancy,"" where you learn that you're pregnant and miscarry often times only days after you were expecting your period. There are those who have had full term stillbirths, with waiting nurseries and installed car seats. And there are those who have loss after loss at varying stages, unsure whether they'll ever carry to term and bring home a living child. Everyone is welcomed in, and I've built several dear friendships on this common ground. 

This year I'm sharing a few links about how to support people when life isn't going well for someone you care about. One is specific to miscarriage, but the other two are more general. Being supportive and loving when times are hard is a skill, and unfortunately it's one that few of us spend enough time consciously honing (myself included until the last few years).

I've rewritten this in my head every night for nearly a year now and when the day came I didn't want to post it. But after talking with someone who is going through her first miscarriage just last week and only shared that with us because we'd spoken after our first loss, i decided my reasons for posting our story were still valid. It's pretty raw (even if i did hold back) so trigger warning:

""I wasn‚Äôt sure if I was going to make this post, I‚Äôm still not sure I‚Äôm ready to unpack it all but if anything is worth coming out of the woodwork for, it‚Äôs this.  Going through my feed tonight I‚Äôve noticed it‚Äôs been pretty quiet on an issue that‚Äôs very close to home, so maybe by sharing our story with my little pocket of the world it will help those also suffering realise that they‚Äôre not alone and break some of the stigma around the subject.  I‚Äôm going to talk pretty brutally about it so this could be quite triggering, but really there‚Äôs no other way to describe it.  Today is Pregnancy and Infant Loss Remembrance Day.  You can probably see where I‚Äôm going with this.

About this time last year, after the roller coaster that is trying for a baby for many people, from taking my temperature every morning, studying the ferning patterns of my saliva in a microscope and peeing on hundreds of little cardboard sticks (yes this is the reality of TTC for some people along with so much more), that second line finally appeared, holy crap.  We were shocked, after not knowing if I would ever be able to conceive there it was.  My hands shook so much I dropped that positive test behind the toilet.  I peed on three more to see if it was an evap line, even breaking out the expensive First Response because ‚Äúthis is the real deal‚Äù.  Sean and I high-fived, my brain was up all night ticking over with thoughts of the future.  We need to finish the floors in the house, save more money, paint the spare room to become a nursery, prepare all ours pets for our first human baby.  I knew long ago that my days would be filled with appointments to manage other medical issues, the specialists stressed the importance of this should the day ever arrive.  I bought a folder to put all my info in and be organised, this would be near full after the first check-up.  

I knew of the statistics of miscarriage (around 1 in 4) so was cautiously optimistic at first, but things were going well.  Until they weren‚Äôt.  Just before Christmas after weeks of agonising limbo we lost our baby and would end up having a traumatic hospital experience that left us going home without our daughter.  Shattered.  A spiral of deep despair would follow.  But soon after came a second pregnancy.  Valentine‚Äôs Day, what a sweet story we‚Äôll have to tell them when they‚Äôre older!  This one would work right?  We‚Äôd already been dealt the shitty deck of cards, this couldn‚Äôt happen twice in a row because that would just be cruel.  But it did.  We were right back where we started.  I decided to pick up my fitness journey and began running to help both physically and mentally.  I was dreading my first Mother‚Äôs Day (on my birthday no less) as a mother without her children, so I decided to turn it into something positive and signed up for the Mother‚Äôs Day Classic, not to run in support of breast cancer, but to run for myself and my lost babies.  I felt like I carried a dirty secret, the lonesome traitor not running for the intended cause.  Little did I know on that run, our third baby was beginning to form.  ‚ÄúThird time‚Äôs the charm‚Äù we‚Äôd tell each other.  Two is pretty bad luck but can still be just that.  Nothing sinister at play.

Things were going really well this time, even though I was extremely sick physically and mentally.  I was at my GP every few days getting a new script of Zofran and whittling away my bank account on it.  I saw a psychologist to help move forward and try and get through this pregnancy for the sake of the baby and with some of my sanity intact.  ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs have another ultrasound just to make sure that strong heartbeat we saw last time is still there‚Äù.  The sonographer gave me the side eye as I‚Äôd had no symptoms of miscarrying but this wasn‚Äôt our first rodeo let‚Äôs be real.  There were a few mishaps with the machine and monitor not working, good old technology we joked.  But there was no flickering, no movement on the screen, surely it‚Äôs just frozen right?  ‚ÄúI‚Äôm so sorry, I don‚Äôt know what to say, there‚Äôs no heartbeat‚Äù.  Those words came the day after what should have been our first daughter‚Äôs due date.  Our second daughter‚Äôs heart had stopped beating mere hours before that ‚Äúparanoia‚Äù ultrasound.  The screen wasn‚Äôt frozen, I was.  This is some Groundhog Day bullshit.  The sonographer put her hand on mine and even though I hate to be touched, the comfort of a stranger was just what I needed.

I wanted to share our story because it‚Äôs something that‚Äôs often shrouded in secrecy and shame.  It‚Äôs not like some heartbreaking montage in an animated movie where you‚Äôre sitting in the doctor‚Äôs office crying and life quickly moves on afterward.  It‚Äôs sitting in that doctor‚Äôs office being asked whether you would like to manage your missed miscarriage medically, surgically or ‚Äúwait it out‚Äù whilst also listening to beat of a healthy baby‚Äôs heart on a Doppler in the next exam room.  It‚Äôs having to constantly sit in a waiting room full of heavily pregnant women moaning and having their partners rub their back, then getting the look of pity when they all hear you say the ‚ÄúM‚Äù word to the receptionist.  It‚Äôs not being given any pain management after labour is induced because ‚Äúthe doctor forgot to prescribe you anything‚Äù and then being given a panamax 8 hours later.  It‚Äôs miscarrying at work.  Twice.  It‚Äôs having panic attacks when you return and need to use the bathroom, then avoiding the stalls on the right hand side because ‚Äúthat‚Äôs the side you always miscarry on‚Äù.  It‚Äôs holding the little poppy seed that is your baby in the palm of your hand before it washes down the shower drain.  It‚Äôs tracking your hCG down to 0 and being elated when your period finally returns, only to receive yet another pregnancy announcement text that rips your heart in two.  It‚Äôs having to carry sick bags for your nausea at the same time as a specimen cup ‚Äúin case you miscarry on the train and want to bring in your products of conception for testing‚Äù.  It‚Äôs not knowing when or where you‚Äôll have the next flashback.  It‚Äôs the immense feeling of guilt for not contacting old friends to see how they‚Äôre coping with the new role of motherhood because it‚Äôs just too freaking hard.  It‚Äôs not knowing how to answer the question ‚Äúdo you have kids?‚Äù.  

I‚Äôve had the most amazing network of support, I really could not have asked for anything better.  But there‚Äôs just nothing that can prepare you for the isolation and emptiness that consumes you.  Talking to others helps for a brief moment in time, but the loneliness always finds you.  I never wanted to become bitter or petty or jealous.  I stopped enjoying the things that once made me happy or helped me cope with the first miscarriage.  The joy of pregnancy is lost to us now.  Planning a geeky announcement, mulling over the finer details of the baby shower, these things have been replaced by fear and dread.  Now we countdown the days to our recurrent pregnancy loss appointment with a specialist.  RPL ‚Äì my scarlet letters I will carry for the rest of my days.  I‚Äôm not afraid of miscarriage anymore, I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôm even afraid of never having a baby.  After multiple chromosomal aneuploidies and dreaming that my babies were born with their conditions I‚Äôm afraid of having a sick child that spends a life time of suffering, knowing the universe was probably trying to tell us something after 3 losses.

So, for anyone who has gone through, is going through or will go through this I‚Äôm so sorry.  I still don‚Äôt know what to say because there really there isn‚Äôt anything that helps, nothing good comes from this experience.  You‚Äôll have good days and horrific days, it‚Äôs a clich√© but it really is one day at a time.  Do things that make you feel happy or even just some semblance of normal in those really dark times.  For anyone who feels lost and lonely and that you don‚Äôt fit in with the world anymore, I want to say it‚Äôs OK if you want to talk about your babies, and it‚Äôs OK if you don‚Äôt.  I just hope that you‚Äôre OK.""",[],,t1_doewxts,False,0,[],False,"<div class=""md""><p>I made my first Facebook post in years. I&#39;ve rewritten this in my head every night for nearly a year now and when the day came I didn&#39;t want to post it. But after talking with someone who is going through her first miscarriage just last week and only shared that with us because we&#39;d spoken after our first loss, i decided my reasons for posting our story were still valid. It&#39;s pretty raw (even if i did hold back) so trigger warning:</p>

<p>&quot;I wasn‚Äôt sure if I was going to make this post, I‚Äôm still not sure I‚Äôm ready to unpack it all but if anything is worth coming out of the woodwork for, it‚Äôs this.  Going through my feed tonight I‚Äôve noticed it‚Äôs been pretty quiet on an issue that‚Äôs very close to home, so maybe by sharing our story with my little pocket of the world it will help those also suffering realise that they‚Äôre not alone and break some of the stigma around the subject.  I‚Äôm going to talk pretty brutally about it so this could be quite triggering, but really there‚Äôs no other way to describe it.  Today is Pregnancy and Infant Loss Remembrance Day.  You can probably see where I‚Äôm going with this.</p>

<p>About this time last year, after the roller coaster that is trying for a baby for many people, from taking my temperature every morning, studying the ferning patterns of my saliva in a microscope and peeing on hundreds of little cardboard sticks (yes this is the reality of TTC for some people along with so much more), that second line finally appeared, holy crap.  We were shocked, after not knowing if I would ever be able to conceive there it was.  My hands shook so much I dropped that positive test behind the toilet.  I peed on three more to see if it was an evap line, even breaking out the expensive First Response because ‚Äúthis is the real deal‚Äù.  Sean and I high-fived, my brain was up all night ticking over with thoughts of the future.  We need to finish the floors in the house, save more money, paint the spare room to become a nursery, prepare all ours pets for our first human baby.  I knew long ago that my days would be filled with appointments to manage other medical issues, the specialists stressed the importance of this should the day ever arrive.  I bought a folder to put all my info in and be organised, this would be near full after the first check-up.  </p>

<p>I knew of the statistics of miscarriage (around 1 in 4) so was cautiously optimistic at first, but things were going well.  Until they weren‚Äôt.  Just before Christmas after weeks of agonising limbo we lost our baby and would end up having a traumatic hospital experience that left us going home without our daughter.  Shattered.  A spiral of deep despair would follow.  But soon after came a second pregnancy.  Valentine‚Äôs Day, what a sweet story we‚Äôll have to tell them when they‚Äôre older!  This one would work right?  We‚Äôd already been dealt the shitty deck of cards, this couldn‚Äôt happen twice in a row because that would just be cruel.  But it did.  We were right back where we started.  I decided to pick up my fitness journey and began running to help both physically and mentally.  I was dreading my first Mother‚Äôs Day (on my birthday no less) as a mother without her children, so I decided to turn it into something positive and signed up for the Mother‚Äôs Day Classic, not to run in support of breast cancer, but to run for myself and my lost babies.  I felt like I carried a dirty secret, the lonesome traitor not running for the intended cause.  Little did I know on that run, our third baby was beginning to form.  ‚ÄúThird time‚Äôs the charm‚Äù we‚Äôd tell each other.  Two is pretty bad luck but can still be just that.  Nothing sinister at play.</p>

<p>Things were going really well this time, even though I was extremely sick physically and mentally.  I was at my GP every few days getting a new script of Zofran and whittling away my bank account on it.  I saw a psychologist to help move forward and try and get through this pregnancy for the sake of the baby and with some of my sanity intact.  ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs have another ultrasound just to make sure that strong heartbeat we saw last time is still there‚Äù.  The sonographer gave me the side eye as I‚Äôd had no symptoms of miscarrying but this wasn‚Äôt our first rodeo let‚Äôs be real.  There were a few mishaps with the machine and monitor not working, good old technology we joked.  But there was no flickering, no movement on the screen, surely it‚Äôs just frozen right?  ‚ÄúI‚Äôm so sorry, I don‚Äôt know what to say, there‚Äôs no heartbeat‚Äù.  Those words came the day after what should have been our first daughter‚Äôs due date.  Our second daughter‚Äôs heart had stopped beating mere hours before that ‚Äúparanoia‚Äù ultrasound.  The screen wasn‚Äôt frozen, I was.  This is some Groundhog Day bullshit.  The sonographer put her hand on mine and even though I hate to be touched, the comfort of a stranger was just what I needed.</p>

<p>I wanted to share our story because it‚Äôs something that‚Äôs often shrouded in secrecy and shame.  It‚Äôs not like some heartbreaking montage in an animated movie where you‚Äôre sitting in the doctor‚Äôs office crying and life quickly moves on afterward.  It‚Äôs sitting in that doctor‚Äôs office being asked whether you would like to manage your missed miscarriage medically, surgically or ‚Äúwait it out‚Äù whilst also listening to beat of a healthy baby‚Äôs heart on a Doppler in the next exam room.  It‚Äôs having to constantly sit in a waiting room full of heavily pregnant women moaning and having their partners rub their back, then getting the look of pity when they all hear you say the ‚ÄúM‚Äù word to the receptionist.  It‚Äôs not being given any pain management after labour is induced because ‚Äúthe doctor forgot to prescribe you anything‚Äù and then being given a panamax 8 hours later.  It‚Äôs miscarrying at work.  Twice.  It‚Äôs having panic attacks when you return and need to use the bathroom, then avoiding the stalls on the right hand side because ‚Äúthat‚Äôs the side you always miscarry on‚Äù.  It‚Äôs holding the little poppy seed that is your baby in the palm of your hand before it washes down the shower drain.  It‚Äôs tracking your hCG down to 0 and being elated when your period finally returns, only to receive yet another pregnancy announcement text that rips your heart in two.  It‚Äôs having to carry sick bags for your nausea at the same time as a specimen cup ‚Äúin case you miscarry on the train and want to bring in your products of conception for testing‚Äù.  It‚Äôs not knowing when or where you‚Äôll have the next flashback.  It‚Äôs the immense feeling of guilt for not contacting old friends to see how they‚Äôre coping with the new role of motherhood because it‚Äôs just too freaking hard.  It‚Äôs not knowing how to answer the question ‚Äúdo you have kids?‚Äù.  </p>

<p>I‚Äôve had the most amazing network of support, I really could not have asked for anything better.  But there‚Äôs just nothing that can prepare you for the isolation and emptiness that consumes you.  Talking to others helps for a brief moment in time, but the loneliness always finds you.  I never wanted to become bitter or petty or jealous.  I stopped enjoying the things that once made me happy or helped me cope with the first miscarriage.  The joy of pregnancy is lost to us now.  Planning a geeky announcement, mulling over the finer details of the baby shower, these things have been replaced by fear and dread.  Now we countdown the days to our recurrent pregnancy loss appointment with a specialist.  RPL ‚Äì my scarlet letters I will carry for the rest of my days.  I‚Äôm not afraid of miscarriage anymore, I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôm even afraid of never having a baby.  After multiple chromosomal aneuploidies and dreaming that my babies were born with their conditions I‚Äôm afraid of having a sick child that spends a life time of suffering, knowing the universe was probably trying to tell us something after 3 losses.</p>

<p>So, for anyone who has gone through, is going through or will go through this I‚Äôm so sorry.  I still don‚Äôt know what to say because there really there isn‚Äôt anything that helps, nothing good comes from this experience.  You‚Äôll have good days and horrific days, it‚Äôs a clich√© but it really is one day at a time.  Do things that make you feel happy or even just some semblance of normal in those really dark times.  For anyone who feels lost and lonely and that you don‚Äôt fit in with the world anymore, I want to say it‚Äôs OK if you want to talk about your babies, and it‚Äôs OK if you don‚Äôt.  I just hope that you‚Äôre OK.&quot;</p>

Baby loss week is upon us and on sunday we will be lighting a candle and sending a wish to our beautiful baby girl Sadie who should have been on her way round about now.
I pray you have never had to experience a loss such as this but for those who have I am sending all the love I have to give. It's a tough road to walk.
""Once you are real you can't become unreal again. It lasts for always""


That last quote is from the velveteen rabbit. It sums up how I dealt with her not being physically here. She was real. She was my baby. And I will miss her and love her until the end of my days.

Xx love to you all.

One year ago this month, when I was almost 12 weeks pregnant, we lost our baby. Our son, as we later learned. Following that unexpected loss, we experienced several more miscarriages over the course of this past year. Each baby was very wanted and very much grieved. We've struggled and cried and worked very hard to persevere during a rather isolating journey, and we have found support from some of the most unexpected sources. 

We've gotten some answers as to why we‚Äôve experienced recurrent pregnancy loss, but still have many questions. How can you be realistic and optimistic at the same time? What's the best way to build resilience? How long can we keep enduring these painful losses? I'm still trying to figure all of that out. I also don't know how to answer my daughter's question, ""Am I a sister yet?"" What I do know is that there is a cone of silence around the topic of miscarriage that's only starting to be chipped away, and opening up the dialogue is part of the critical path to supporting those facing loss. 

Today is Infant and Pregnancy Loss Awareness Awareness Day. While I rarely get this personal on social media, I felt a pull I couldn't ignore to put this out there in case anyone reading is feeling alone. If someone in your life has faced this struggle, acknowledge it, even if it makes you feel uncomfortable. If you can, please bear that momentary sense of awkwardness, because your words will help ease a much heavier emotional load. Don‚Äôt let not knowing the ‚Äúright‚Äù thing to say prevent you from saying anything at all. It can be super simple, and even acknowledging that you don't know exactly what to say is fine; it's the gesture that counts. We're forever grateful to those who showed up when we needed them most. Those who stood beside us physically or emotionally as we grieved however we needed. Throughout it all, our daughter is our laughter and light, and more of a miracle than we ever realized. She is what keeps us going. 

I'm sending so much love to all mothers and fathers whose babies are in their hearts but not their arms, and I wish you the most beautiful rainbow after the storm. üåà üíúüë∂üèª",[],,t1_doemlod,False,0,[],False,"<div class=""md""><p>I‚Äôve decided to share on Instagram today.

It has been a while since I have left my own comment in this thread (though I read daily, but late, due to being in a different timezone).  Deciding to go to India for 3 months is one of the greatest decisions of my life.  

Overall, the poverty in so many parts of Kolkata is just absolutely crushing.  It is far beyond the scope of any other developing countries that I have visited.  People (young and old) sleep on sidewalks, people bathe in filth.  At the risk of sounding insensitive, my experience here has given me some much cherished perspective.  Yes this one *horrible,* life-defining thing happened to me, but overall I have so much to be grateful for.  I still cry for and mourn my son, but I am able to move beyond those moments of sadness.  When I think of the poverty here, I am faced with a feeling of ""How dare I?"" in terms of my own personal struggles.  In India,   
I feel alive again - I feel joy again.  I have been able to move beyond my comfort zone and actually let loose, dancing endlessly at an outdoor concert and at a club.  Those are experiences I've never had before.... I am pretty introverted (loss made that infinitely worse) and dancing is something I previously never even did while alone.  My husband and I have been together for 14 years and we've never managed any dance moves together beyond slow dancing.

<p>It has been a while since I have left my own comment in this thread (though I read daily, but late, due to being in a different timezone).  Deciding to go to India for 3 months is one of the greatest decisions of my life.  </p>

<p>Overall, the poverty in so many parts of Kolkata is just absolutely crushing.  It is far beyond the scope of any other developing countries that I have visited.  People (young and old) sleep on sidewalks, people bathe in filth.  At the risk of sounding insensitive, my experience here has given me some much cherished perspective.  Yes this one <em>horrible,</em> life-defining thing happened to me, but overall I have so much to be grateful for.  I still cry for and mourn my son, but I am able to move beyond those moments of sadness.  When I think of the poverty here, I am faced with a feeling of &quot;How dare I?&quot; in terms of my own personal struggles.  In India,<br/>
I feel alive again - I feel joy again.  I have been able to move beyond my comfort zone and actually let loose, dancing endlessly at an outdoor concert and at a club.  Those are experiences I&#39;ve never had before.... I am pretty introverted (loss made that infinitely worse) and dancing is something I previously never even did while alone.  My husband and I have been together for 14 years and we&#39;ve never managed any dance moves together beyond slow dancing.  Faced with a bunch of Indian people horrified that you aren&#39;t dancing (it&#39;s such a part of the culture here), demanding to know why you aren&#39;t dancing -- I guess anything is possible.  Carpe diem, right?</p>

But to me, that's completely OK - just because the pain is less, doesn't mean it's not there, and it's still OK to acknowledge it and feel sad/frustrated/scared/however you feel.

As for telling people... since I wasn't testing early, I only knew about my pregnancies for barely a day or two before I realized I was losing them, so we never actually told anyone until after the fact. Only a few people even knew we were TTC, so they eventually knew about the CPs, but we purposefully chose to tell only 3 people who we knew would support us in the way that *we* wanted to be supported if anything went wrong. For us, that meant people who would help us stay positive (and a little distracted), and ask us how we were doing but not in an annoying ""are you pregnant yet???"" kinda way. This meant we had some support during our struggle, but it was the ""right kind"" of support for us. We didn't tell our immediate families (except my sister, who was one of those 3 people) about the current pregnancy until after our 12-week NT scan and NIPT test results came back looking good. And we didn't tell anyone else until about a week ago, when our 18-week anatomy scan came back with good results. We've been honest about our losses with some more close friends now that we're ""out"" with the current pregnancy, but we chose to wait to share the news until we felt more secure.

On the flip side, though, some folks just throw caution to the wind and tell everyone each time, and there's nothing wrong with that either. There are quite a few people here who believe every pregnancy should be celebrated, no mater how short/long and what the outcome, and who want the support of their entire team behind them if something goes wrong. I'm not that brave, but I admire that attitude, and I can definitely see the appeal in that as well.

Loss is never easy, no matter when it happens, or how many times.

<p>On the flip side, though, some folks just throw caution to the wind and tell everyone each time, and there&#39;s nothing wrong with that either. There are quite a few people here who believe every pregnancy should be celebrated, no mater how short/long and what the outcome, and who want the support of their entire team behind them if something goes wrong. I&#39;m not that brave, but I admire that attitude, and I can definitely see the appeal in that as well.</p>

<p>Loss is never easy, no matter when it happens, or how many times. I hope you&#39;re able to find some peace and the support you need, whether it&#39;s here or IRL! &lt;3</p>

In some ways, I considered myself ""fortunate"" that my losses didn't require medical intervention and didn't negatively affect my cycle, so I didn't *need* to wait to try again. But in other ways, it felt so... fleeting, since I only knew about the pregnancies for a day or two before they were gone. But even though I only knew for a short time, it still hurt a lot (and got harder the more I had), and as time went on, it did feel a bit weird to ""jump back into the saddle"" so quickly.

Because of my age (I'm 37), my husband and I decided each time that we didn't want to wait to keep trying. Each time it happened, we took an evening off from our other commitments just to relax with each other and do something fun at home, like watch a movie or play some video games. But as we did, we lit a candle or some incense and offered a quick ""thank you"" to the baby, for the short time s/he spent with us. Nothing big, just a little acknowledgement that helped us feel some closure. For us, that was enough to help us move on and keep our eyes on the goal of eventually having a LC. And as weird as this sounds, we like to think that our loss-babies understand - after all, they're part of the team too, even if they're not here. They know we love them no matter what, but that our goal is to have a living child here with us, and we believe they'd want that for us as well.

The still-in-progress ""conclusion"" to my story requires a TW for current pregnancy: I ended up pregnant again the cycle after my 4th CP (even though we started trying again right away each time, this was the first time I'd gotten pregnant again immediately after a CP), and I'm currently 19+4. It was hard at first - at every appointment, I was asked for the ""date of my last menstrual period,"" which in my case was the date of my 4th loss. And I'd lurked on the February bumper sub with the loss-pregnancy (my due date would have been late Jan/early Feb), and suddenly here I was in the February sub again, except this time on the other end (my new due date is late Feb/early March). It was weird to meet people and say hello, then say goodbye, then say hello again 4 weeks later. It's taken time, but I've come around to enjoying the pregnancy experience (mostly... I'm still pretty terrified haha), and this sub has been a HUGE part of that.

Sorry for the novel haha... I hope there's something in here that helps a bit, and if nothing else, just know you're not alone in not knowing quite how to feel about it.

My loss was at 20 weeks, so it was hard to know how to feel/act during the second one. We found out it was a boy and bought a few things at 12 weeks. That was hard because we still have a couple months before we passed our loss milestone. But on the other hand, having stuff in the house for THIS baby felt like a show of faith, that we would have him here. All the way up til the end I really kept thinking ""IF we get this baby"", not WHEN like so many people take for granted. 

I will say that when he was born I was a bit... I don't know, overwhelmed? I think I had been so focused on getting through pregnancy and an alive baby that when he was here I was like "" I DID IT"" instead of... I don't know, whatever normal people experience when baby is born. I remember feeling like I wasn't feeling all the right emotions. It felt weird to call him his name- he was an actual person all of a sudden.

 After a few weeks I really bonded with my son and now 6 months out obviously, he is everything. But I've said it here before- it sucks that maybe we don't get the perfect pregnancy without anxiety and fear and conflicting emotion. But plenty of women, even without loss, don't bond during pregnancy. It's totally normal! 

But the goal in the end isn't pregnancy, its baby. So do what you gotta do to get through the pregnancy. Also if it helps, now that I am not pregnant anymore I see other preggos and am like ""Holy shit that was a really magical moment in time, I had my kid inside me and he moved around and shit and I got giant WHAT HOW INSANE"" and I can remember the good stuff a lot more vividly then the bad stuff.",[],,t1_docvzq0,False,0,[],False,"<div class=""md""><p>TW:LC</p>

Before conceiving my 3yo , I had 2 chemical pregnancies in a row, so I got to experience the innocence of pregnancy for like, one day before I realized how easy it is to lose your baby. During my pregnancy with my daughter, I felt uneasy the entire time but started allowing myself to believe I'd bring a baby home after 14-15 weeks. But I really struggle with pregnancy-- the complete surrender of my body is excruciating both physically and mentally. I tend to feel awful pretty much the entire pregnancy and being so uncomfortable made it very difficult to bond with my baby because I didn't feel like myself. When she was born, it changed in an instant. The second I heard her cry, my love was infinite and immediate. It also helped that my discomfort was diminished by about a zillion percent. I'm one of those rare women who thinks recovering from a csection is easier than being pregnant.

With my second child, I had the same anxiety in the first trimester, compounded by a subchorionic hemorrhage and a weird bloodwork number at my 12 week screening, which turned out to be nothing. I didn't feel comfortable with that pregnancy until after the anatomy scan, when the baby looked fine. But again, I didn't feel bonded to my baby. My pregnancy was uncomfortable, I was exhausted, my energy was further sapped caring for my toddler, and I just assumed that I'd like the baby at birth-- it had been so automatic with my daughter that I was comfortable assuming that when I heard the baby cry, the switch would flip again and I'd bond.

My son was stillborn at 39 weeks, 2 days, well beyond the ""safe"" window I had thought existed. I never heard him cry, so I never got to flip that switch that made loving him so easy and automatic. Instead, it has been a real effort on my part to forge a bond and figure out how to parent my dead child. But the one thing I can say with absolute certainty is that guarding myself in any way for the duration of pregnancy didn't in any way diminish the pain of having to bury my child. Guarding yourself is normal, and perhaps necessary for self preservation, but it does not lessen the pain of a loss.

I'm currently five weeks pregnant, and it's still too early to feel too miserable all the time, so I'm sure, if I'm lucky enough to have this pregnancy progress, that my mindset will shift as my body does. But knowing that the pain of losing a pregnancy is still unbearable even when you've held it at arm's length, I am working to treat this pregnancy differently. I'm very conscious that taking it one day at a time is the only way to keep my sanity. I tell myself, ""today, I am pregnant"" constantly. If all I get of this baby is some portion of pregnancy, I don't want to regret not having some level of acceptance with it. I know that every single day will have anxiety and fear, but I'm hoping I can also make room for excitement and hope every day as well.

All this to say, if you find you are struggling to get attached to the idea of a pregnancy, it is normal. Your goal is a baby, and a pregnancy is just the means. But it won't change your pain or lessen your sorrow if your pregnancy has a negative outcome, so it's okay to feel however you feel but it is beneficial to find your way towards some positivity about it, because if some amount of weeks are all you get, you'll want to have been able to enjoy them on some level.

As u/duckingcluttered said, ""part of me braced for loss right up until I gave birth."" I kept a note about the website Still Standing in with my birth supplies. But, I did work to bond with my LC in-utero. I talked to her, told her stories, wrote down things I wanted her to know (in case I died in childbirth, because apparently loss makes me morbid). I didn't want to miss that time with her. I didn't want her to have a moment where she thought she wasn't welcome. 

And honestly, at our first pediatrician appointment I was so combative/defensive my husband chided me, until he realized I was terrified they were going to take the baby away from us. Hormones, probably, but also fear of loss in a different way.

It got slightly better after the previous loss date. We never announced on Facebook. After she was born I deleted my Facebook, so we still haven't.

<p>And honestly, at our first pediatrician appointment I was so combative/defensive my husband chided me, until he realized I was terrified they were going to take the baby away from us. Hormones, probably, but also fear of loss in a different way.</p>

After the 1st mc I was a nervous wreck when I was pregnant with my 9yo and struggled to get excited about it because I kept assuming I would lose her at any moment.

I‚Äôll never know if the 1st mc contributed to my PPD or if it was just bound to happen.  

With my second mc recently, I had started to allow myself to get more excited once I passed the point of miscarrying my first, and was cautiously optimistic after we saw a heartbeat a few times, but because growth was never on target and progesterone was low I always had these objective signs that the pregnancy was tenuous so it was harder to get attached but I think ultimately easier when I miscarried.  I think in the end the loss was harder on DH because I tried to shield him from as much of the anxiety as I could since it was his first pregnancy.

I'm 19 weeks now and was SUPER anxious until we got the (good/normal) results of our NIPT test and NT scan (in week 12).

I pushed myself to participate on the Alumni thread here and in my monthly bumper sub a bit. It was easier than real life because it was virtual/anonymous, but it was still hard. Ultimately it did help me feel a little more ""normal"" as the weeks went on, so I'm glad I did.

Finally after a good anatomy scan (at 18 weeks) I'm still pretty anxious, but I feel like I've passed the 50/50 mark of being more excited than scared (just barely haha). We just announced publicly, which has been very scary, but my husband is super excited, so I'm trying to roll with it.

I do know they are not allowed to transfer large numbers any more.

I would certainly let them know that you're okay with the concept of ending up with two! But they may be reluctant to do anything which increases the chance of a multiple birth because this increases risks for you and for the baby/ies.

I don‚Äôt know if there‚Äôs anything anyone can say to really make things better. It‚Äôs a terrible situation that no one should have to experience. I‚Äôve had two miscarriages, and with the first one it was the first time in my life I felt completely powerless and like I had no control over anything anymore. I was used to dealing with everything logically as well. With a miscarriage, all of a sudden you‚Äôre at the mercy of not only your body, but also the emotions - from the grief, and also from the crazy hormonal changes that are happening.

In my experience, there was absolutely nothing that would have made me less sad or angry. The emotions were really intense for the first couple of weeks and I was just doing what I could to get through the day, but then after that I went through another wave of emotions when I started actually working through things. Slowly I was able to function at work and when I needed to, but I did find that even if I was able to bury the emotions for a while, they would need some kind of release eventually.

To work through it, I journaled and talked to people about it. I‚Äôm not one to talk about my feelings much, but every time I forced myself to do it I was glad I did. I also found that trying to express feelings through art and music brought a different perspective and helped me understand things from a new angle.

I don‚Äôt think anything of those things really made me feel better, but they helped give the feelings the focus they needed. Sometimes all I needed was a distraction though, so I tried to find hobbies or entertainment that I could lose myself in.

Overall, I would just say be accepting of how you‚Äôre feeling and allow yourself to really feel everything. Do what you need to do and go easy on yourself.

As for how to cope...the best I can say is to do it minute by minute, then hour by hour, then day by day. Feel what you feel. Be bitter and sad and angry and confused. Those are all normal. They're hard, as nobody wants to feel that way, but you're grieving. You're grieving a very real loss -- not just of your baby, but if all the hopes and dreams you had for that child and your family. It is NOT easy and don't let anyone make you feel like it should be.

Now, of course, that's all well and good except life goes on and we're expected to go to work/etc. I get that. Try to pamper yourself a little. Maybe journal how you are feeling.  When you have to go back to work, try to set aside a set amount of time each evening where you can just FEEL and don't have to hide it. And actually, one of my biggest suggestions is NOT to hide it. I hid my pain after my first loss, for a little bit, and it was even harder on me. I needed to open up about why I was so down all the time and just being raw and honest with people really helped me feel like I didn't have to pretend to be happy at work/with friends/etc. If you're open to the idea of being public with your loss, I truly think it can help. If that makes you uncomfortable, obviously it might be harder for you. 

I say craft, journal, clean house, exercise, read...or be a total bum if you want. Do whatever seems to help you in the moment. If you take up a craft or a new exercise, thinking it will help, but it doesn't...then stop. Don't force yourself to keep doing something just to try to distract. 

There is no easy or straight answer, but please do know that you aren't alone. Unfortunately (and fortunately) so many of us have been there and ""get it."". HUGS!

When everything came back clean, I was diagnosed as ""unexplained infertility"" (sooo helpful).

In the end, she suspected that one of the two most likely issues was that my eggs, while still plentiful, weren't the best quality, so the resulting embryos weren't viable. She ultimately recommended IVF with PGS, so we could screen any embryos for chromosomal abnormalities before transferring them back. We ended up not going that route, but that was going to be our next step.

So I guess to answer your question, I don't think it's crazy at all to consider IVF as an option in your situation. As for transferring two and hoping for twins, your RE can probably provide the best insight to weighing the risks and benefits - from what I gather, some REs are totally fine with trying this (especially if the embryos aren't PGS-tested first and if you're over 35), while others will refuse to transfer more than one - moreso to avoid the risk of triplets than because of the twins per se.

You'll still ovulate as usual as long as you have both ovaries. On your good side, it's business as usual. On the other side, there's no more local tube for easy access.

Chen L, et al. Int J Surg. 2017: a smallish study (48 women with ectopic pregnancies treated by salpingectomy)  found an intrauterine pregnancy rate of 81.3% by 3 years of followup.

Just to reiterate what another poster said - if you have the slightest inkling that you might be pregnant, take it seriously!  My doc encouraged me to come in for a blood test if I suspect anything, because he'd much rather take a little extra blood than risk my remaining tube.

If you had a SCH I'm sure it would have been mentioned. Also, their cause has to do with the placenta, which it doesn't sound like they saw in your scan.

Unfortunately it sounds like the doctors may be right to suspect ectopic -- I am very glad they told you and are going to keep an eye on it. I know it will be a long week!!!  Will you get more betas in the week before your next scan?

I remember talking to the anesthesiologist about my dogs, then falling asleep. I woke up in a recovery room. Very light cramping that was resolved with OTC meds. Now I'm 5 days out and still feeling good. I'm so happy I went with the D+C - no pain, no memories, and I was in the hands of professionals rather than on my own with no idea what I was doing.

Finally, we have a heartbeat. Just over 100bpm, but apparently with the dating adjustment that's also in ""normal range"".

Another ultrasound is scheduled for the same time next week, where we'll be tracking for appropriate growth and adjusting my EDD if we see it. For now, relief.

If you want to keep the moment private, then that&#39;s ok too - you don&#39;t need to be the crusader to raise awareness if it will ruin a moment you think is best kept for yourself and your family.</p>

Please know that nothing you did caused your miscarriage. Again unfortunately, miscarriage happens all the time and for many reasons.  You did not cause this. Your surgery did not cause this. <3

The passing of time is hard and knowing that we'll be older and older when we hopefully get a baby is just tough. I get that - its such a common concern and hard to reconcile with the timelines our bodies force us on. Hang in there!

Also, you should be congratulated on your huge weight loss and taking your health under your own control. Well done! I am sure you'll appreciate being healthier when you hopefully conceive again. So, well done!

And now to put on my Mod Hat -- the user who was hurtful to you has been fully banned from posting in this subreddit. We do not condone that type of behavior and I'm sorry you were subject to it. Please know that if you ever have any issues like that, reporting them *does something* and we're quick to act.

But if you're looking for ways to better use OPKS and/or track, I gave you some. As I understand from your other posts in this sub, this is your first time using them and they can be confusing and frustrating. 

As I said, testing in the afternoon is almost always the best. I am also at work at 2 pm, as are most people I know, and have had to take my OPKs to work and test there. You can catch a surge in the morning or evening, but it is less likely. If you cannot do that, its understandable. But I am just informing you that its the ideal time. And that comparing an evening test to a morning test is practically useless as so many other factors change. It is also best to hold your urine for 2-4 hours before testing and even limit liquid intake for couple hours beforehand. Truly only 1 test a day is needed, if you're testing at the same time a day. There will be a difference when there is a surge.

Learning about how temperature coverlines work is also important. Many people's pre-O temps can vary up to a full degree. The post-O spike is usually significant enough that its quite obvious. A .2 degree change does not indicate ovulation or any other issue at all.

There is no need for FF Premium - tracking your temperature, cervical position, cervical mucus, and OPK results without premium will still allow you to see a trend. Most tracking apps will work, as FF can be confusing. But you can't rely on them to accurately suggest when you'll ovulate based off average cycle length alone. You need to track some of the other data -- and usually 2-3 cycles worth of data is needed before an app will ""more accurately"" suggest a fertile window.

You seemed worried that the line changing back and forth and not having a positive by CD11 meant something bad. I assure you that neither is a bad thing. You just need to use them for longer and ensure your urine is not diluted.

 I had RPL before conceiving my son (3 chemicals not dr confirmed because I was dumb and a 12 week mmc) and I have had 3 losses since having him (chemical, 9 week, 9 week). Expectant management  (continuing to try without ivf) has a high chance of success but it can be at the expense of great emotional trauma. So, your femara may increase your chances of conceiving which can accelerate things but will most likely not help things on the RPL side. That being said you can always get that lucky combination (like I did with my son) and find success it just may be at the expense of another loss. For us, we are struggling with the financial side of things and the fact that ivf isnt a guarantee either.

Don&#39;t worry about being at home, I read a lot on here to prepare myself and what I wasn&#39;t prepared for is that where I am (uk) they give you the first pill 48 hours before then you are admitted to hospital for the day to take the second. I was upset about this as I wanted to be at home but I was lucky in that the first pill kicked everything off and it happened at home anyway. </p>

<p>(TMI warning) </p>

<p>All in all, i took the first pill on a Thursday morning, started spotting lightly on the Friday around 3pm. Woke up around 4am with cramps, like bad period pain. I don&#39;t really suffer from period pain and it was enough that I couldn&#39;t get back to sleep but manageable. It ramped up a bit then I passed everything by 7:30 and as soon as I&#39;d passed the sac the pain stopped. To be honest the cramps did get worse but I breathed through them and the most uncomfortable part for me was sitting on the toilet for long periods of time it was giving me horrible pins and needles. It was painful for a couple of hours but was over quickly and I&#39;d choose that over surgery. I didn&#39;t like what I read about D&amp;Cs possibly causing scar tissue that could cause problems conceiving later on. </p>

But you truly need to learn how to use them for them to be a useful tool in TTC.

Usually the LH strips will show a test line ALL the time, but faintly. And the strength can differ due to time of day and/or hydration. Your tests were at night and in the morning -- so 2 completely different times of day. 

You can see a faint line for days on end...as there is always LH in your body. Then you will see a darkening over 1-2 days and then have 1-2 days of what would be called a positive -- where it is the same or darker than the control line. 

Its suggested to use OPKS at the same time every day, and often suggested that it be in the early to mid afternoon. Most LH surges happen in the morning but do not show in urine until something like 2 pm. So by testing at the same time, and in the afternoon, you are most likely to catch the surge. 

Also, OPKs alone cannot confirm ovulation. Many people think ""I had a surge"" and then worry that their period is late/etc. MOST OFTEN, a surge means you ovulate in the next 12-36 hours. But a positive OPK can only show that there was a surge, not that you actually ovulated. Sometimes a body can ramp up to ovulate and then not do it. The only ways to confirm ovulation are to temp or to get an ultrasound.  But most often a surge does mean you ovulate soon after. 

CD11 is still early for many people. If your cycles average 28 days, you could expect a surge on CD13ish. But again that isn't always the case. And if your cycle is longer than that, its quite possible you ovulate later, too, which would mean a later surge. 

Also, a spike in temperature from 35.9 to 36.1 means very little -- its not a large spike and that's only 2 data points.

Your story is so closely related to mine. We lost our daughter last November at 20 weeks and then this August we found out I was pregnant again. This time with identicals. At 7 weeks they said I was behind by a week. At 8 weeks there were no longer heartbeats. My hcg started dropping but slowly and they monitored for a week. At that time I elected to take misoprostol.

Your story is so closely related to mine. We lost our daughter last November at 20 weeks and then this August we found out I was pregnant again. This time with identicals. At 7 weeks they said I was behind by a week. At 8 weeks there were no longer heartbeats. My hcg started dropping but slowly and they monitored for a week. At that time I elected to take misoprostol. I officially miscarried about 8 hours later. Now 2 weeks later my hcg is down to 7. My RE has said we can try again in December. But I‚Äôm still so angry.

At least not for infertility itself -- the lack of conception. But I really mind it when someone has had multiple losses and they just think it'll work. 

Progesterone after ovulation is a questionable science. MANY doctors prefer to ensure that your progesterone from ovulation is already enough to sustain a pregnancy -- which is what Femara/Chlomid could help with. But if your CD21 numbers are already fine, there isn't a need and its throwing a lot into your body for no reason (and in your case, causing you to wean earlier than planned).

An 11 day LP is perfectly fine for conception, so length alone isn't a huge concern. 

I would suggest CD3 testing (along with near surge again for follow up) and at least 3 cycles of CD21 testing before I did fertility meds. But DEFINITELY before IVF. I cannot believe you haven't had CD3 tests done, as that's in a basic RLP panel. Without the karyotyping/etc results, you need to at least be gathering ALL the other data. 

Just for reference, here is a list of what I've had done: 

Blood tests: 

* Factor II
* Beta-2 Glycoprotein 1 IGG AB
* Beta-2 Glycoprotein 1 IGM AB
* TSH, T4, and T3 (ensure its a full Thyroid panel)
* Antinuclear antibody (ANA)
* Factor V Mutation,
* prothrombin gene mutation
* Anticardiolipin AGG+IGM
* Lupus Anticoagulant Comp,
* Hgb A1c and Estim. Ave Glu (eAG)
* Antimullerian Hormone (AMH)
* Baseline LH (CD3 test)
* FSH (CD3 test)
* Estradiol (CD3 test)
* LH during surge time
* Estradiol during surge time
* Homocysteine
* DHEA Sulfate
* Insulin
* Prolactin
* Day 21 Progesterone testing (numerous cycles)
* Blood karyotyping
* Ferritin
* Folates
* Total Iron Binding Capacity with Iron
* Reticulocyte Count
* Vitamin B12
* Folic Acid
* Protein S
* Protein C

Others:

* Genetic testing on one baby after MC
* Saline Ultrasound
* karyotyping on both of us
* Hysteroscopy with endometrial biopsy
* 23andme (which I used for my MTHFR results mainly, ordered before my 2nd loss just because we were curious)

I was in a similar position to you a few months ago, except that all of my losses (3 confirmed, plus a possible 4th unconfirmed, all within about a year, no LC) were CPs at around the 5 week mark. My RE never tested my progesterone because she didn't ""believe in"" that as a cause for early pregnancy loss, but all other repeat loss tests (blood tests, physical tests, etc.) came back clean except for fibroids. So the conclusion was that either I wasn't ovulating ""strongly enough"" to get past the early stages of pregnancy - in which case Femara might help - or that my 37-year-old eggs were plentiful but of poor quality and the pregnancies were terminating because they were not viable.

We were going to jump straight to IVF, but my insurance required 6 months of medicated cycles before they would cover it, so instead I did Femara cycles. The 4th cycle ended in another CP, and we decided that we'd only give it one more try before jumping to IVF/PGS (we were just going to ""pretend to try"" for that 6th cycle while secretly preventing, just so another loss wouldn't further delay IVF. Instead, I ended up pregnant again on the 5th Femara cycle, and am now 19 weeks. (So to recap/clarify - 2, maybe 3 ""natural"" CPs, 1 CP on Femara, 1 so-far-successful pregnancy on Femara.)

That said... it's a tough decision. In some ways, we were ""lucky"" because our insurance company made the decision for us, but if those 6 cycles weren't required, we probably would have cut right to the chase and done IVF from the beginning. We've had two successful anatomy scans and our NIPT test came back low risk for genetic issues, but I was TERRIFIED for about the first 3-4 months because I was afraid that there could still be something wrong with the baby even though this one ""stuck."" It's hard to say whether the Femara was the key to helping the pregnancy last past the first stage, or whether I just got lucky and finally hit on an egg that was ""good enough"" to produce a viable pregnancy, or some combination of both (I suspect both, but we'll never really know).

Sorry this turned into a novel haha... I hope there's something in here that's helpful for you, even though it's just an anecdote. I wish you the best of luck with whichever path you choose! <3",[],,t1_do5zkhe,False,0,[],False,"<div class=""md""><p>TW: Current pregnancy</p>

<p>I was in a similar position to you a few months ago, except that all of my losses (3 confirmed, plus a possible 4th unconfirmed, all within about a year, no LC) were CPs at around the 5 week mark. My RE never tested my progesterone because she didn&#39;t &quot;believe in&quot; that as a cause for early pregnancy loss, but all other repeat loss tests (blood tests, physical tests, etc.) came back clean except for fibroids. So the conclusion was that either I wasn&#39;t ovulating &quot;strongly enough&quot; to get past the early stages of pregnancy - in which case Femara might help - or that my 37-year-old eggs were plentiful but of poor quality and the pregnancies were terminating because they were not viable.</p>

<p>We were going to jump straight to IVF, but my insurance required 6 months of medicated cycles before they would cover it, so instead I did Femara cycles. The 4th cycle ended in another CP, and we decided that we&#39;d only give it one more try before jumping to IVF/PGS (we were just going to &quot;pretend to try&quot; for that 6th cycle while secretly preventing, just so another loss wouldn&#39;t further delay IVF. Instead, I ended up pregnant again on the 5th Femara cycle, and am now 19 weeks. (So to recap/clarify - 2, maybe 3 &quot;natural&quot; CPs, 1 CP on Femara, 1 so-far-successful pregnancy on Femara.)</p>

<p>That said... it&#39;s a tough decision. In some ways, we were &quot;lucky&quot; because our insurance company made the decision for us, but if those 6 cycles weren&#39;t required, we probably would have cut right to the chase and done IVF from the beginning. We&#39;ve had two successful anatomy scans and our NIPT test came back low risk for genetic issues, but I was TERRIFIED for about the first 3-4 months because I was afraid that there could still be something wrong with the baby even though this one &quot;stuck.&quot; It&#39;s hard to say whether the Femara was the key to helping the pregnancy last past the first stage, or whether I just got lucky and finally hit on an egg that was &quot;good enough&quot; to produce a viable pregnancy, or some combination of both (I suspect both, but we&#39;ll never really know).</p>

I woke up to pee around 4:30am and felt water slowly trickle out once I was laying back in bed. Wasn't sure if it was my water breaking slowly or leftover from afternoon sex. I had told my husband to sleep elsewhere because I had horrendous gas so I went to that room and he was awake. We evaluated and couldn't decide, but then I had another small gush so we were pretty sure. I'm GBS+ so we started to get ready to go in, but I had a contraction. It stayed in my lower belly so I wasn't sure it was ""real"", but it certainly hurt. They started coming every 5 min and were about a minute long each. I hopped in the shower and realized they were coming every 3.5 minutes. Cue panic - we need to leave NOW!

Left around 6 and got into the L&D room at 6:30. I felt nauseated but had to pee so I sat on the toilet and immediately projectile vomited everywhere. Turned around to get it into the toilet and it went over it instead. Puke *everywhere*. Ew. Contractions were 2.5 min apart at this point and I thought I was dying. Asked for an epidural ASAP, but of course had no IV yet. Finally got everything squared away with that around 7:30 when I was 1.5cm, 80%, -3 station. 

The contractions slowed down so once the epidural was working right (it initially wasn't getting my left), they added pitocin and let me be. This was maybe 8:30. I had my peanut ball and was content. The doc I had seen was off for change of shift and opted to not check me so I didn't get checked again until 12:45pm. Complete, 0 station, time to prep to push. They were shocked, but I had told them I was having a lot of pressure!! 

I started pushing a little after 1, and he was out at 1:46!! He immediately shat all over me but I couldn't have cared less. He's absolutely perfect. 

Breastfeeding has been a challenge. He latched so well right away, but at some point during a later feeding managed to get just my nipple and now it's blistered. My other one has a skin tag and is flat so getting a good latch is hard. He bruised that side trying. They both hurt a lot. Had to give a little formula but still working the tits. Hopefully this gets easier. 

Once we pick a name I'm going to break my social media hiatus on this news. I can't thank you guys enough for all of the support through the losses and then the anxiety of this pregnancy.

Also, my sister is in the process of getting them engraved with an &quot;L&quot; as well.   </p>

<p>My heart goes out to all of you who have also lost babies in utero or born. This is truly the cruelest, cruelest pain. </p>

Since you didn't test the baby, it's possible the stillbirth was due to a chromosomal issue. In that case, the issue could have been spontaneous or inherited from either you or your husband. A karyotype on both of you would rule this out.

I had a baby this morning!!! Yesterday at 39+2 I noticed a little bit of pink spotting and then some much more frequent Braxton Hicks. Maybe an hour later I had a few little leaks of fluid.

First check around 10pm I was 3cm dilated (was 1 on Thursday). They sent me to L&D. My contractions slowed from about every 2 minutes to every 5, so we started pictocin.

Our follow-up appointment with the genetic counselor will be in early November, which works out well since that's when my next period is due, and we can't get pregnant until after that.

Fortunately insurance is going to fully cover the chromosome analysis, which could have been around $1000/person.  Insurance denied coverage for carrier screening though so it'll be $400/person.  I'm guessing it's because this is typically ordered through the OB, not genetic counselor, but we're OK with paying it ourselves.  It can take about a month to get results back anyway, and husband and I are both proponents for getting as much information as possible so that we can make better informed decisions.

Hopefully they come back clearing us of genetic abnormalities or both being carriers for something serious.  I suppose that won't answer any of our questions as to why we've had 5 CP/MCs, but I'd prefer that over potential genetic problems.

Last time I posted, a few of you had suggested I ask about MTHfr testing.  I did, and the counselor said that it's so common across the general population that, as geneticists, they don't feel it's worthwhile to test for it.  Guess that'll be something I'll talk about to the RE once I get referred to one.

Anyway, feeling alright.  At first I saw taking a 2 month break as a waste in time, but it is actually doing wonders to my emotional state.

The pain of losing a child is so burdensome, and you are really, really IN it right now. My heart goes out to you. 

There are a few things that have helped me to survive since my stillbirth. Some of these may or may not work for you, so take what you like and leave the rest, but it is important to find things that you can hang on to to pull you through these dark, shitty days.

1. Finding a therapist specializing in perinatal loss. This has been invaluable to me-- my counselor understands the shittiness that losing a pregnancy or a baby brings, and also understands the pain and stress of trying again (and being pregnant) after a loss. She helps to confirm that what I'm feeling is normal, and has been a remarkable source of comfort.

2. Finding a local support group. Seeing people further down the road on this journey has been helpful to remind myself that things will not always be this challenging. Seeing people who are newer to this road reminds me how far I have come and supporting them and sharing my experience gives me a sense of purpose.

3. Learning something new. I began taking guitar lessons. I just needed something to do with my hands and heart. I have a toddler at home and adding some more music to our house has been a nice way to fill the silence left behind when our baby died.

4. Blue Apron. I enjoy cooking and find that 30-60 minutes a day of mindlessly following a recipe is really beneficial, and at the end of it I have created something for my family to eat. But I still am too jumbled up to do much menu planning or grocery shopping. Having food and recipes delivered each week has kind of solved my biggest problems for me. It's more expensive than just cooking at home would be, but its way cheaper than the takeout we'd definitely be ordering without it.

5. Finding something, however small, to look forward to each day. Sometimes we have big plans like apple picking, but much of the time my things are like, ""tomorrow a new episode of my favorite podcast comes out.""

<p>I&#39;m really sorry that you find yourself in this place - your feelings seem so valid to me and I&#39;m just mad at everyone in your life for not being more supportive. </p>

I lost my son at 39 weeks this past May, and it is the kind of pain I wouldn't wish on my worst enemy. I, too, have struggled with feelings of helplessness and anger about my body.

What I have found helpful in the intervening months, (besides using this sub as a safe place to vent and share my feelings) is to see a therapist with my husband. She specializes in perinatal loss and tends to see her families until they've had a rainbow baby, or until they've come to some other sort of resolution that they have found peace with. I also decided that I very much needed to do something with my heart and my hands, so I bought a guitar and started taking lessons. I'm pretty terrible at it, but having something to pick up and do with my hands after I've started going down a path of anxious thoughts. The concentration it takes to play helps me pull my focus away from the anxiety spiral.

I've also done a number of other things-- started finding podcasts I enjoy, binge watching tv shows that don't contain pregnancy or stillbirth triggers (90s sitcoms seem to scratch this itch for me very well) and trying to find small things to look forward to as often as possible so it doesn't feel like time is standing totally still. These are all just suggestions, in time you and your wife will find the things that work best for you, both alone and together.

As for fertility-- I knew in the hospital, the moment I learned my baby didn't have a heartbeat, that I wanted to try again as soon as possible. I had a vaginal delivery and recovered with relative ease, so my midwife gave me the green light to start trying after my first period came, as long as I felt emotionally ready. I still don't know what ""emotionally ready"" means. But I do know that after an experience like this, there isn't really anything intelligible I can explain to people, all there is is the burning desire to populate my home with my children, and there's only one way for me to forge ahead with that. So when my period came six weeks later, we began trying again. I had a 5 day luteal phase, so we couldn't have gotten pregnant no matter what. My following two cycles weren't much better-- my luteal phase seemed to be doomed to increase by only one day at a time. I knew I would go crazy if I had to wait 7 months to have a normal luteal phase. I also knew that it typically takes 3-6 months for female reproductive hormones to level out after a delivery, especially at full term. But my husband and I didn't feel we had any time to wait (for various reasons) and we enlisted the help of an RE. After a pretty thorough workup to make sure there were no other issues, he prescribed progesterone to use during the luteal phase and that seems to have done the trick, because it did quite the jump that cycle.

I am telling you all of this to let you know that it really can take a while to regain full fertility. This was so maddening to me that I almost wished I had been instructed to wait 6 months, so that I would be forced to give my body time to find equilibrium before we really started trying. It was another frustrating situation where I felt like my body was failing me. 

As for your internal debate on when and whether to try again-- so many factors will wind up coming into play. With a csection, it is likely that you will be told it is preferable to wait before trying again. My midwife told me that if I had opted for a csection she would have preferred I wait 6-12 months. I just met another couple who had the same story as me and my husband, except they had had a csection as well. They were given the same advice but chose to start trying immediately as well after evaluating the risks of a pregnancy shortly following a csection and deciding that they could stomach it.

The most important thing my therapist told me, as we began discussing our desire to try again, was that it is possible to both grieve and be pregnant at the same time. You don't mention this in your post, so I'm not sure if this is something you have concerns about, but one of my primary concerns about trying again was whether I would have mourned my son for the ""right"" amount of time before becoming pregnant again. She gently told us that we'll be mourning forever, and that there is no ""right"" time. (Although I'm sure plenty of other people will tell us their opinions about this when the time comes. üôÑ) So, just know that whatever you and your wife decide, it will be the appropriate decision for your family.

I lost my son at 39 weeks this past May, and it is the kind of pain I wouldn&#39;t wish on my worst enemy. I, too, have struggled with feelings of helplessness and anger about my body.</p>

<p>What I have found helpful in the intervening months, (besides using this sub as a safe place to vent and share my feelings) is to see a therapist with my husband. She specializes in perinatal loss and tends to see her families until they&#39;ve had a rainbow baby, or until they&#39;ve come to some other sort of resolution that they have found peace with. I also decided that I very much needed to do something with my heart and my hands, so I bought a guitar and started taking lessons. I&#39;m pretty terrible at it, but having something to pick up and do with my hands after I&#39;ve started going down a path of anxious thoughts. The concentration it takes to play helps me pull my focus away from the anxiety spiral.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve also done a number of other things-- started finding podcasts I enjoy, binge watching tv shows that don&#39;t contain pregnancy or stillbirth triggers (90s sitcoms seem to scratch this itch for me very well) and trying to find small things to look forward to as often as possible so it doesn&#39;t feel like time is standing totally still. These are all just suggestions, in time you and your wife will find the things that work best for you, both alone and together.</p>

<p>As for fertility-- I knew in the hospital, the moment I learned my baby didn&#39;t have a heartbeat, that I wanted to try again as soon as possible. I had a vaginal delivery and recovered with relative ease, so my midwife gave me the green light to start trying after my first period came, as long as I felt emotionally ready. I still don&#39;t know what &quot;emotionally ready&quot; means.

The natural miscarriage wasn't completely horrific for me, like I imagined it would be.  There was a lot of pain but it was closer to intense period cramps for me, personally.  There was a lot of bleeding, a lot of clots, a lot of tissue but it did not all come out at once like so many miscarriages seem to have happen.  I did see our embryo after one particularly painful day of cramping and I said goodbye.  I thought the worst of it was over and figured the residual bleeding was just normal from what I read online and figured it would eventually die down.

Two weeks after my initial appt, I had a follow-up and they told me I still had retained tissue that needed medical aid to come out.  The ultrasound tech pushed and pushed saying I'd need a D&amp;amp;amp;C and that it wouldn't come out any other way.  I really wish I could go back to that day and tell her to STFU because she had NO right to say jack to me about what to do with my body.  The doctor told me to take the cytotec that was still in my nightstand and that it should dislodge the rest of the tissue no problem.  I took the pills the next day and it wasn't as bad as I had read online.  It was, again, like serious period cramps and I did bleed but it wasn't as intense as I had heard from other people.  I was starting to get anxious, though, as I wasn't passing any tissue.  That night I had a clump of clots and tissue come out and went in for my follow-up that Friday still lightly bleeding.  The doctor then told me that my uterus looked clear, albeit ""fluffy"" and assumed it was just due to the trauma of the MC so she booked me for a baseline scan a week later.  She told me to expect more to come out as another clump of tissue was working its way to my cervix.

A week later I went in for my baseline and was advised it wasn't ""fluffy"" but that I had retained tissue that needed to come out and I had to have a D&amp;amp;amp;C as nothing else was going to get it out.  I booked the D&amp;amp;amp;C for the following Tuesday morning.  That evening, I had more heavy cramping and more tissue came out but it still wasn't enough and I ended up at my D&amp;amp;amp;C on Tuesday.  The worst part of the D&amp;amp;amp;C was the IV placement.  I had general anesthesia and was given anti-nausea medication so I felt zero ill effects from the anesthesia.  I woke up quickly, was given crackers and ginger ale along with pain medication and meds to help stop my bleeding.  I took ibuprofen a couple times over the net 24 hours and finished my anti-bleeding mediation the next day.  Recovery was easy; I used a pad the day of the procedure then switched to a liner as I only had spotting for a few more days.  The hormone dump hit me 2 days after the procedure and that kinda sucked but I had been getting hormone dumps as I passed tissue so I was used to it at that point.

The beauty of the D&amp;amp;amp;C was that I was DONE.  There was no more ""we'll see in a week how you're doing"" - they used an ultrasound during the procedure and they only had to tug at the one remaining chunk of tissue and then I was clear.  I had a follow-up in 2 weeks with the doctor and then was released into the wild.  I really felt it was therapeutic to pass my pregnancy naturally at first, but eventually it turned traumatic.  I learned the end of July of the fetal demise and I am just now getting back into trying again due to the length of time spent passing the tissue.  If you do pass naturally, please schedule a follow-up with your doctor for an ultrasound to ensure all tissue has passed.  Even a tiny piece of tissue left can wreak havoc on your body.  I totally understand if you want to take the natural route, but just make sure you're clear once it's done.  If you're still bleeding at 2 weeks, chances are you have retained tissue and that can be potentially damaging to your fertility with scarring and infection, too.  None of the options for a non-viable pregnancy are pleasant.  Natural miscarriage is NOTHING like a period, either.  It's so incredibly different and so much more painful.

I'm not great at handing over responsibility to authority i.e. doctors. Or holding back when I want something. 

The gamble is huge, though, considering the chance of prevention is high if diagnosed with that particular problem. Also while I think I'm taking this loss better than the second one, I have no idea how hard it's going to feel in the coming weeks and I don't think a fourth would be easy at all. 

I'm just going to need to get my mind off this and on to other things, is the answer. Waiting is really the more rational and safe thing to do.

<p>The gamble is huge, though, considering the chance of prevention is high if diagnosed with that particular problem.

I was in your shoes back at the end of May.  I had spotted a bit, 2 ultrasounds showed fetal demise, and I was presented the options to naturally let this miscarriage happen, take cytotec, or get a D&C.  I was told not to wait more than a month for the natural miscarriage as it had already stopped developing for a week or so and that could risk infection.  A friend of mine ended a pregnancy with cytotec and had a horrible time with it, though did not need the hospital.  I was also told with the pills there is a chance of needing a D&C anyway if there was retained tissue.  They told me a D&C was the fastest resolution to TTC-ing again....  I scheduled my surgery for June 8, and it went well.  I had minimal cramps and spotting right after, was back to work the next day, and told after my 2-week post-op visit I should get my period in 2-4 more weeks.

Week 6 came and I had no sign of a period.  I called the office saying I felt like something wasn't right, I was having no signs of a period showing up.  They brushed me off saying I should give it another few weeks.  I did and called back with the same story: no period, no signs, nothing.  They had me come in from a physical exam, said things looked okay and ordered betas.  My beta level was not high, but in the 20s.  They had me come back 2 days later, then a week after that.  My levels were hovering in the 20s so they ordered an ultrasound, this was Aug 25.  I had just got back from the hospital when they called and said they saw a mass with blood flow in a spot it should not be in my uterus, the term interstitial pregnancy was said, and I needed to IMMEDIATELY go to the ER for methotrexate.  They thought the mass was new tissue.  I go and spend 5 fucking hours there, get the shots, have to skip a 10K I was excited to run due to the sun sensitivity it causes, and got more betas.  

The betas kind of dropped then stalled again around 15ish.  I got another ultrasound and the mass was still there, and I don't know what they saw differently this time, but they concluded they had misdiagnosed the ectopic/interstitial pregnancy and it was actually tissue they missed from my first D&C nearly THREE months prior, and I needed a second D&C to remove it.  I begged for another option, so we tried cytotec to no avail.  I even had bleeding pre-cytotec and thought that it was my body trying to get rid of the tissue and the pills would speed it up.  Only I just cramped a lot and didn't bleed anymore.  

So I gave up and today had my second D&C, this time guided by ultrasound.  I was told it's not normal practice for them to use U/S for a first time D&C unless they know tissue was retained from other methods.  They also never did follow up betas or an ultrasound (I was told these were also not part of their normal practice) right after my first procedure.  If I could do things differently, I would have taken a risk with the pills only because of the use of a guided U/S if I needed a D&C after all.  I chose the ""fastest"" option and it's been four months.  I believe that the majority of the time a D&C is quick, thorough, and does the trick.  I am bleeding more (kind of like a normal period, nothing heavy) this time which makes me think the other doctor who did my first procedure was just not as thorough, I don't know.

I am not going back to that practice after this is officially wrapped up.  I cannot pursue anything legally as this is just the ""nature of the procedure"" and the consent and language they use covers this. All I can say is whatever you choose, please please speak up repeatedly if you feel like something is not right at any point.  You know your body more than they do.  Be your loudest advocate for your health.  Good luck.

I got a prescription for pain meds and had bad cramps for about 2 hours, and a lot of pressure, but I didn&#39;t think it was that bad overall, as far as I can remember (it&#39;s been over a year). The cramps came and went for about a week or so. For me I liked it so much more being home with my husband. It was one of the saddest times of my life but having it finally be over with was definitely a relief, and the sadness got better, especially once my period returned and we could try again. Good luck with whatever you decide to do!</p>

Warning: this is a little graphic.


After finding out a few days after I hit 9 weeks that the baby has stopped growing at 9+0, I was certain I wanted the D&C. When the doctors office called to confirm my appointment, I immediately asked if the procedure could be scheduled the same day - obviously that wasn‚Äôt a call that the receptionist was able to make, but I was determined and ready.

Surprisingly, my attitude totally changed once speaking with the doctor. You will hear many different opinions on this subject - but we were told after a D&C we needed to wait 3 months, but taking the medication would mean we were cleared to try again once my period returned. I couldn‚Äôt stand the idea of no longer being pregnant, so we opted to give the pills a try. 

She prescribed them Thursday afternoon at our appointment and recommended I take them on Saturday so we would be home all day. Again, being determined to try again as soon as I could, we filled the prescription immediately - grabbed some giant pads, some takeout food and headed home for the long night ahead of us.

I put the pills in around 6pm, had my pain medication, nausea meds, a big glass of water and my giant pads ready. A couple hours go by, nothing happens. I fall asleep and wake up around 6am, still nothing but a little spotting. 

Next day, we call around noon to explain that we don‚Äôt think the pills are working. We get another dose prescribed over the phone - head straight to the pharmacy for round 2. Again, no luck.

By this point I am... drained. I know the D&C is impending and there is nothing I can do. We go see the doctor for confirmation of what we already knew. Nothing had passed. The doctor said she didn‚Äôt want to wait more than a week for the D&C, because of the risk of infection- we schedule it for 7 days later, hoping maybe something will happen by then and head back home.

Over the next couple days, I experience what my husband and I can only describe as ‚Äúspirals of death‚Äù - 4-5 hour long episodes of the worst pain I have ever experienced in my life - and I consider myself to have a high pain tolerance. The cramps are uncontrollable, coming and going in waves. I am crying, my husband is begging me to go to the ER. I know that there is probably nothing that they would be able to do. I take the narcotic pain pills, it does nothing to dull the pain. I am switching between sitting on the toilet and violently vomiting. I can‚Äôt decide whether I want to lay down; or sit, or move. I feel paralyzed. I crawl back to bed, and I feel a rush of something into my pad. I get up to go back to the bathroom, and the pad isn‚Äôt containing what is happening. My poor husband is trying to scrub the blankets (the only thing I could think to ask him to do, he looked so helpless). I still know that it isn‚Äôt ‚Äúover‚Äù as I haven‚Äôt felt anything substantial come out. 

We experience 3 of these episodes, but I still know the D&C will be necessary - two days before the procedure, I am bleeding semi heavily and wonder if things are beginning to progress on their own. In a last ditch effort- I call the doctor and ask for the pills one more time. (call me crazy - I don‚Äôt blame you). We get them first thing in the morning. 

The day goes on, and I feel some mild cramping, and I go to sit back on the toilet. And what happens next is very obvious to me. I tell my husband that it is all over. We decide we don‚Äôt want to look, so we don‚Äôt. We hug, we cry, we comfort eachother. I can honestly say I have never felt more loved or comforted in that moment. I have never loved my husband more. He has been my rock throughout all of this. I think this experience showed me how amazing we are together. It ... was an amazing experience. 

Our doctors appointment the next day confirmed that we are done. It is over. And the D&C is cancelled.

I would recommend the pills 100x over. Personally, I needed to be at home, with my husband. It was comfortable there. I was able to come to terms with what was happening, and the physical pain can never touch the emotional pain that we went through. I was able to lay back in bed, knowing that it was all over. I knew my body was able to do what it was supposed to do, and I didn‚Äôt have to worry about any of the effects of surgery. I think it took my body extra time to understand what was happening - but it eventually got with the program. That is something I feel like I would have missed out on with the D&C. 

I honestly cannot say if my miscarriage was natural, or if it was due to the pills. I consider it a little bit of both. 

I think it‚Äôs a personal choice, and the pain is scary. But knowing my body is working the way it should, and I can understand and feel fully what had happened, has helped me tremendously. Whichever way you choose, will be what is right for you! 

Edit: I wanted to add two things -

We were fortunate enough to be able to be at home together for over a week during this experience - I may have felt differently if that was not an option.

I went into this whole thing selfishly being determined to get pregnant again immediately. What I learned from my experience at home is that I needed this closure for our baby, my husband and myself. While we are trying again, I feel like it is now for the right reasons, as our way of grieving our ‚Äúfirst baby‚Äù was able to be done on our terms, and I am no longer trying to ‚Äúreplace it‚Äù.

<p>By this point I am... drained. I know the D&amp;C is impending and there is nothing I can do. We go see the doctor for confirmation of what we already knew. Nothing had passed. The doctor said she didn‚Äôt want to wait more than a week for the D&amp;C, because of the risk of infection- we schedule it for 7 days later, hoping maybe something will happen by then and head back home.</p>

<p>Over the next couple days, I experience what my husband and I can only describe as ‚Äúspirals of death‚Äù - 4-5 hour long episodes of the worst pain I have ever experienced in my life - and I consider myself to have a high pain tolerance. The cramps are uncontrollable, coming and going in waves. I am crying, my husband is begging me to go to the ER. I know that there is probably nothing that they would be able to do. I take the narcotic pain pills, it does nothing to dull the pain. I am switching between sitting on the toilet and violently vomiting. I can‚Äôt decide whether I want to lay down; or sit, or move. I feel paralyzed. I crawl back to bed, and I feel a rush of something into my pad. I get up to go back to the bathroom, and the pad isn‚Äôt containing what is happening. My poor husband is trying to scrub the blankets (the only thing I could think to ask him to do, he looked so helpless). I still know that it isn‚Äôt ‚Äúover‚Äù as I haven‚Äôt felt anything substantial come out. </p>

<p>We experience 3 of these episodes, but I still know the D&amp;C will be necessary - two days before the procedure, I am bleeding semi heavily and wonder if things are beginning to progress on their own. In a last ditch effort- I call the doctor and ask for the pills one more time. (call me crazy - I don‚Äôt blame you). We get them first thing in the morning. </p>

<p>The day goes on, and I feel some mild cramping, and I go to sit back on the toilet. And what happens next is very obvious to me. I tell my husband that it is all over. We decide we don‚Äôt want to look, so we don‚Äôt. We hug, we cry, we comfort eachother. I can honestly say I have never felt more loved or comforted in that moment. I have never loved my husband more. He has been my rock throughout all of this. I think this experience showed me how amazing we are together. It ... was an amazing experience. </p>

<p>Our doctors appointment the next day confirmed that we are done. It is over. And the D&amp;C is cancelled.</p>

<p>I would recommend the pills 100x over. Personally, I needed to be at home, with my husband. It was comfortable there. I was able to come to terms with what was happening, and the physical pain can never touch the emotional pain that we went through. I was able to lay back in bed, knowing that it was all over. I knew my body was able to do what it was supposed to do, and I didn‚Äôt have to worry about any of the effects of surgery. I think it took my body extra time to understand what was happening - but it eventually got with the program. That is something I feel like I would have missed out on with the D&amp;C. </p>

<p>I honestly cannot say if my miscarriage was natural, or if it was due to the pills. I consider it a little bit of both. </p>

<p>I think it‚Äôs a personal choice, and the pain is scary. But knowing my body is working the way it should, and I can understand and feel fully what had happened, has helped me tremendously. Whichever way you choose, will be what is right for you! </p>

<p>Edit: I wanted to add two things -</p>

<p>We were fortunate enough to be able to be at home together for over a week during this experience - I may have felt differently if that was not an option.</p>

<p>I went into this whole thing selfishly being determined to get pregnant again immediately. What I learned from my experience at home is that I needed this closure for our baby, my husband and myself. While we are trying again, I feel like it is now for the right reasons, as our way of grieving our ‚Äúfirst baby‚Äù was able to be done on our terms, and I am no longer trying to ‚Äúreplace it‚Äù. </p>

I wanted to do something other than wait. My experience wasn't all roses, and I do not know if everything had passed, but we shall see on Monday. 

On Friday at 7:00 pm, I inserted 4 pills vaginally. I'd read to dip them in water first as to help them dissolve more quickly, but my doctor didn't say to do so. I wish I'd done so. I also put on one of those mega overnight maxi pads.

At around 9:00, I started getting a fever and chills. I fell asleep feeling absolutely nothing pain-wise at around 10. At 11:30, I woke up in excruciating pain. I was crying, doubled over, and had to have my husband stay up with me for a few hours. Fell back asleep after Advil and crying myself to sleep.

At 3:30, I woke up from a strange sensation, went to the bathroom, and passed large blobs of dark red and gray tissue. Bleeding then started heavily. 

At 7:00 am on Saturday, I took the second dose of four. Spent the day in bed with a heating pad, Advil every 4 hours, and frequent pad swaps. I was frustrated that I did not ask for a scrip for ""real"" pain meds. 

I took the last two doses of pills on the same 12-hour schedule. I continued to pass large amounts of gray/beige/red tissue until Wednesday. Yesterday and today, the bleeding has slowed to a light red and brown flow, with occasional tiny dark blobs. I never had fever/chills past the first night. Other than that first night's excruciating pain, the physical pain was like extremely bad period cramps mixed with the feeling of being karate chopped in the pelvis.

Seeing everything was a mind-fuck, but the more traumatic image burned into my mind is the ultrasound without a heartbeat. 

Hopefully this was helpful somewhat. Again, I don't have any ""well this worked great! All clear!"" results yet, but I passed so much material that I want to believe it is all out. 

I'm so very sorry for your loss.

I had a very similar experience; found out at 10.5w that baby had stopped growing at 6.5w.  

I was given 3 options:
1. wait it out, miscarry naturally at home in an undetermined amount of time
2. Take misoprostol to induce contractions, probably miscarry at home within a few hours to a few days.
3. D&C that same day.

I personally knew that I needed it to be done as soon as possible so I could grieve, so I opted for the D&C.  I had also overheard a horror story from a woman in the emergency bay beside me that tipped the scales for my decision (she had taken the drugs over a month ago and was still bleeding, so she was coming in for a D&C anyway). 

There was little pain with the D&C - just some cramping that night, and some more intense cramping a few days later when some clots were expelled.  Far less than I expect a natural MC would be.  I also knew I couldn't handle seeing the sac and baby, nor could my husband.  

The surgery was quick, and I opted for sedation rather than anaesthesia. I don't remember a thing between telling them my name in the OR and chatting with the nice nurses afterwards.

I am back from my ultrasound confirming 3rd loss. It was hard. I asked them to move me to a separate room while I waited, because they put you in with happy pregnancies, and they found me a space to cry. My sonographer was the polar opposite of the one who inadvertently broke the news to me the other day - she was skilled and looked carefully and I could see the screen the whole time and knew quickly there was nothing. A tiny sac and yolk, too small for 6 weeks. She told me she herself had suffered three losses, which was kind of her. 

Then I went for my blood draw, and was seen by a kindly but irritating woman making misguided attempts at sympathy, stroking my knee (wtf?) and 'awww'-ing in a terribly patronising manner. She proceeded to fuck up my blood draw, and couldn't get a vein. I am prone to dizzy spells when having blood taken and rather than letting me ignore what she was doing she kept stabbing then saying 'ooh, does that hurt?' until I broke down sobbing and asked for someone else, which she said wasn't necessary. Then I asked for five mins alone before she tried again and she didn't return - she sent someone else. Thankfully the second nurse was more experienced and asked if I would prefer her simply to give me practical information and plenty of space, which was what I needed. She also struggled to find a vein - apparently my failure to eat or drink much for 24 hours made my veins shrink - but managed eventually. 

They're just checking for any signs of retained tissue or ectopic with the blood draws. I'll go in for a second one on Sunday and they will then discharge me from their (outpatient) care, and then it's on to RPL testing via my GP for a referral. 

My husband has been wonderful - he drove to collect me from the hospital and I said I needed to eat. I said I wanted pizza, and we went to get take away pizza. He's such an incredible optimist, and hates seeing me sad, but he said he admires my ability to cry and not bottle it up. 

He wants me to be open with my family (and asks permission to be with his) because he doesn't want me to encounter questions about having more kids from people who don't have the whole story.

There isn't a great way to know if your losses are all related to the same reason or if they have a reason at all. Especially with early losses. Clotting could still be a factor in an early loss but its unlikely that being Rh negative is. 

I live in the US so I can't say for sure how your testing will go. Does the NHS provide testing after 3 losses or make you wait longer? 

Many doctors start with a standard workup that includes a few 
standard tests. I have had way more than that done, as I have had 5 losses and they never found a true reason...so we kept testing and trying. I'm going to include what I've had done and you can look them up/discuss with a doctor.

Blood tests: 

* Factor II
* Beta-2 Glycoprotein 1 IGG AB
* Beta-2 Glycoprotein 1 IGM AB
* TSH, T4, and T3)
* Antinuclear antibody (ANA)
* Factor V Mutation,
* prothrombin gene mutation
* Anticardiolipin AGG+IGM
* Lupus Anticoagulant Comp,
* Hgb A1c and Estim. Ave Glu (eAG)
* Antimullerian Hormone (AMH)
* Baseline LH (CD3 test)
* FSH (CD3 test)
* Estradiol (CD3 test)
* LH during surge time
* Estradiol during surge time
* Homocysteine
* DHEA Sulfate
* Insulin
* Prolactin
* Day 21 Progesterone testing (numerous cycles)
* Blood karyotyping
* Ferritin
* Folates
* Total Iron Binding Capacity with Iron
* Reticulocyte Count
* Vitamin B12
* Folic Acid
* Protein S
* Protein C

Others:

* Saline Ultrasound
* karyotyping on both of us
* Hysteroscopy with endometrial biopsy
* 23andme (which I used for my MTHFR results mainly, ordered before my 2nd loss just because we were curious)
* Chromosome testing on a baby after loss

If you have to push for things, I would push for karyotyping on both of you, clotting tests, and a full thyroid panel. 

Good luck. HUGS!

No time to ponder. I can just rely on the thought that our first decision to go have a child must have been right and is still valid, even though I lost touch with the person that made that decision.
Sorry if this is hard to understand, I am not a native speaker.</p>

The hospital did a great job of sending us home with resources and connecting us with a support group. But one tidbit I got from other women in the same boat was to make some kind of social media announcement ahead of your expected due date, if you had announced the pregnancy online. (Which I had done at 25 weeks, just 2 weeks before my stillbirth.)

Edit: Of course, the math isn't always that easy. For example, some services are covered under co-pays, and the amount that you pay as a co-pay generally does not count towards your deductible. I learned this year that my insurance treats OB visits as specialty and pregnancy visits to an OB as counting towards the deductible. We calculated that it would be in our interest for them to bill my insurance as a pregnancy visit, even though it would cost more of pocket first. Given that I expected to hit my deductible this year, continuing to pay co-pays would have cost more than just paying until I hit the deductible and then having insurance cover X%.",[],,t1_dntk4s0,False,0,[],False,"<div class=""md""><p>Ah, gotcha.

I've been charting my ovulation and I'm ovulating at a normal time for me (I typically have long cycles, ovulating around day 21 and having about a 35 day cycle) but then the luteal phase-- the period between ovulation and getting your period-- has been incredibly short, making a pregnancy impossible because a fertilized egg wouldn't have time to implant. I've been told over and over that this is normal as the hormones try to regain equilibrium after delivery, and I would assume that the same could generally be true following a miscarriage, since your body is also recovering from a pregnancy. Because my luteal phases are so short but the hormones at the beginning of my cycle have been measured and are normal and I'm ovulating normally, presumably I have low progesterone. I obviously can't diagnose you since I am neither a doctor nor do I know your whole history, but spotting for several days prior to your period is often a symptom of low progesterone too, so I think it's a really good idea to be visiting your doctor to evaluate.

I don't think you're reading too much into things-- if something seems weird to you, it's never wrong to loop in a pro. One piece of advice I have-- be prepared to advocate for yourself. One of the constant refrains I have been hearing from doctors and midwives is that ""this is normal, it takes time for your body to heal."" I am aware of this, but I was also not comfortable with waiting several more months before doctors would even be willing to do some further investigating, because a lot of times that's kind of a wasted cycle in its own right while they do bloodwork, etc. You may not be able to convince your doctor to start looking into any issues immediately, because most will say that 3-6 months is a normal amount of time for reproductive hormones to be off-kilter following a pregnancy. But if it will make you feel better to have a plan of attack, push for that-- for example, if you're still seeing inconsistencies in two or three more cycles, you'll be back and take some more steps to find out if there's really an issue or not.

When this sub started in 2014, I was one of the first in it. Luckily I got pregnant with my son soon after and there wasn‚Äôt an alumni thread/sub yet so I peaced out to CBB. 

History: MMC, stopped growing at 6 weeks. In that pregnancy we found out I have a bicornuate (heart shaped) uterus. Between MC and next pregnancy we did a saline sonogram and doc doesn‚Äôt think the shape caused the MC. I did get some additional monitoring when pregnant again with my LC. 
In both pregnancies I bled a lot. Once for a SCH but even after that resolved. It is a horrible feeling to see blood everyday and hope that your little peanut is still okay. I‚Äôm braced to go through that again but so far, so good. 

This was my third cycle off the pill. Didn‚Äôt get a positive until 12DPO. I‚Äôm a little worried that my wondfos aren‚Äôt getting much darker. My FRERs are but not as dark as I‚Äôd like. I did my first quant/prog blood draw yesterday. Results tomorrow. 

I‚Äôm determined to enjoy every day of this. I didn‚Äôt tell my husband in the morning so I could get him a cigar and give it to him when he got home. I had ‚Äúhere it goes again‚Äù playing and tried to get my son to hand it to him but that failed lol. Starting to think of ways to tell our parents and friends when we‚Äôre ready. My MIL comes over everyday to watch our son so I‚Äôm gonna have to be sneaky.

Guys, I'm so happy.  A few more details while I'm up nursing and before the whirlwind of family visits today:  

As you know, I spent the week cranky and overdue.  On Tuesday I called my ob with some weird symptoms, and on Thursday got the call that I had an infection that's nbd to me but horrible for baby and highest risk of transmission is vaginal birth.  So, I went in to my appointment Friday and we decided on a C section as the safest course of action.  Big mind F at 40+5 esp since my first was vaginal, but there were some advantages off the bat such as being able to bring older kid to grandparents in a leisurely way etc.  section was scheduled for yesterday (sat) am which honestly was what I needed to get on board mentally- we'd get to see her soon (though we didn't know she was a she just yet)!  So we packed for a longer stay, went out to dinner w toddler and my parents, and did a little research on c section recovery etc, but not much.  

Next day we got to hospital at 6, checked in, was in or around 9.  Because normally only emergency Cs etc are on the weekends, we had the floor to ourselves and a huge, relaxed, attentive team.  Getting the spinal and getting prepped in the Or without my husband was rough, but they let him come in once they started. The doc also didn't tell me until she had already started, which I appreciated as I wS most scared of feeling that first cut but all I felt was pressure the whole time.  She asked if w were ready to meet our baby, and then went quiet and urgent w the assist people so I got nervous-  but turns out she's just like my husband and daughter w a 90% head and even in a C you can get a little stuck üòÇ.  They did some maneuvering and in about a min she was out and screaming and we learned she was a girl!  My husband went with get to be weighed etc which was a bit lonely for me but they shouted updates and also my husband brought the camera over to show me pics while I got stitched up.  After about 10 min and 2 perfect apgars I was able to hold her and it was heaven.  

Our Lucy Jean weighed in at 7 lbs 15 oz and 19 in.  She is gorgeous like her big sis and possibly another ginger but it's a bit hard to tell.  I don't really do imgur and am Instagram friends with a lot if you lovelies so you'll see pics there today once I get them off our good camera and onto phones.  Pm me for an Instagram add if you like!

  I'm honestly glad I have places like this on the internet. I didn't/ don't want to tell people in my life about this yet because I don't want to be tip-toed around and pitied. (I'll be open about it when I do have a sucesful pregnancy going on) 

I love that online you can say whatever you want and have some distance from other people's expectations. There really isn't anything someone can say to make things better, but having communities of people who understand exactly what you're going through or how you're feeling- and have gotten through the other side of it- is tremendously comforting.

     I avoid it with people because I don't want to deal with feeling bad that I made them feel bad to talk about it. I've told my BFF the most and she was really good at just listening and swearing with me about how shitty this shit is. Multiple times she said she didn't know what to say... and that's 100% a good thing! There IS nothing to say at some points. But she had understanding and was always there to talk. 

Friends and family should NOT try to fix things. Don't try to put the burden on yourself that you can help make things better. You can't. Nothing can other than time or acceptance. Just let the person know you are there for them anytime they want you to be.

When I was going in for my D&C one nurse told me she had had two D&Cs, and then proceeded to have three kids afterwards. That's the info that helps me keep my thoughts from scary dark places. 

Also, I had counselling scheduled for deprecate issues that started at the same time... I didn't find it helped me at all for this. In fact I've been avoiding going. She mainly told me I need to let myself grieve and I don't feel the need to go back until that's ""done""

1. I felt like our hospital sent us home with a good amount of resources after my stillbirth. We were referred to a therapist specializing in perinatal loss. We were given a few age-appropriate books to help us begin to explain to our toddler what happened to the baby. We would maybe have been well-served to have been given a book specifically for US to begin processing, but maybe not-- that would have likely gotten lost in the shuffle for us in our extreme focus on trying to explain death to a two year old who had never encountered it before. 

2. In our case, the number one useful thing, even more useful than food, was offers to babysit. We had a lot of appointments in the immediate aftermath of the stillbirth-- postpartum appointments, funeral home appointments, therapy appointments. Having a toddler tag along for any of those would have been extra draining. It's very hard to ask for help, so it's better if people offer concrete things to assist. Rather than saying, ""Let me know how I can help!"" say something like, ""I'd like to make you a meal. Can you let me know what would be a good day and time to drop one off?"" or, ""Please tell me when I can bring my kid over for a playdate so you and your partner can go out and decompress or accomplish something you need to accomplish."" Even just offers to listen or be a shoulder to cry on are welcome, (depending on the person-- I am absolutely not in a frame of mind where I want to unload on someone who has a newborn/is pregnant-- too triggery right now). The key is to be specific, and then to follow through on that, and offer repeatedly. A lot of help tends to come in the first couple of weeks... and then it dries up while you will spend months in an emotional hell. 

Useful for all families but probably especially to families with young living children: cleaning the house or sending over a housecleaning service is priceless. No one has any energy for cleaning here and our home truly looks like an animal cracker graveyard. Cleaning is just not a priority until the ants start overtaking the kitchen. I wish some of the resources people sent our way after our loss had addressed this need. 

As far as food: STOP SENDING LASAGNAS. No one likes them that much and we got at least five delivered to us. We started throwing them out, we were so sick of them. Some people really appreciate the food delivery, but I personally found after my loss that cooking was kind of therapeutic. Following a recipe and stepwise instructions for an hour helped me to feel a little more human and a little less helpless. But I wasn't emotionally (or physically) ready to menu-plan or grocery shop, so I got very excited about Blue Apron. Any meal delivery service is kind of ideal for this kind of mindset-- the foresight and shopping parts of the equation are removed, and then you can just arrange your ingredients into a meal you would have otherwise ordered pizza for. It was a nice way to feel mildly productive-- Blue Apron gift cards were a useful way for people to help us out after the lasagna delivery portion of outreach had kind of passed.

3. DO SAY: ""I'm sorry."" ""I can't imagine what you are going through."" (Unless you have had a parallel experience, in which case sharing your own experience might be supportive.) ""Here is a specific offer of ways I can assist you during this time."" 

DO NOT SAY: 
- Anything that dismisses or attempts to diminish their sense of loss or grief. 
- Anything that even approaches complaining about your own pregnancy or living children-- they would trade places with you in a heartbeat
A lot of the other things are situational or specific to the person-- some people want to hear things like, ""You'll have another baby."" Some people find that upsetting, because no one can actually guarantee that. 

4. This is another thing that will differ from person to person, but for me, I was really unprepared for how much loss would fuck up my baby fever-- I feel an urgent desperation to be pregnant, and it can sometimes feel like no one who can help understands the crisis mode that I am in. Every day that I'm not pregnant feels like torture. I wish that someone in the hospital could have told me to expect that, and I wish that all my healthcare providers were willing to act based on this urgency to come up with a plan to help me achieve pregnancy again in the wake of my loss. I don't know how to suggest to you resources which could remedy this problem, though. I know in the hospital their goal was literally to get me through the one day where I had to deliver my dead baby. But the months of agony as I've watched my hormones remain messed up has been almost as excruciating with considerably less support, and that's been really hard for me. If I could change one thing about the loss community, it would be to increase emphasis on assisting with TTC, along with assisting with grief and with decision making when given terrible news about a pregnancy.",[],,t1_dnpzmhp,False,0,[],False,"<div class=""md""><p>TW: Living Child</p>

We had a lot of appointments in the immediate aftermath of the stillbirth-- postpartum appointments, funeral home appointments, therapy appointments. Having a toddler tag along for any of those would have been extra draining. It&#39;s very hard to ask for help, so it&#39;s better if people offer concrete things to assist. Rather than saying, &quot;Let me know how I can help!&quot; say something like, &quot;I&#39;d like to make you a meal. Can you let me know what would be a good day and time to drop one off?&quot; or, &quot;Please tell me when I can bring my kid over for a playdate so you and your partner can go out and decompress or accomplish something you need to accomplish.&quot; Even just offers to listen or be a shoulder to cry on are welcome, (depending on the person-- I am absolutely not in a frame of mind where I want to unload on someone who has a newborn/is pregnant-- too triggery right now). The key is to be specific, and then to follow through on that, and offer repeatedly. A lot of help tends to come in the first couple of weeks... and then it dries up while you will spend months in an emotional hell. </p></li>
</ol>

<p>Useful for all families but probably especially to families with young living children: cleaning the house or sending over a housecleaning service is priceless. No one has any energy for cleaning here and our home truly looks like an animal cracker graveyard. Cleaning is just not a priority until the ants start overtaking the kitchen. I wish some of the resources people sent our way after our loss had addressed this need. </p>

<p>As far as food: STOP SENDING LASAGNAS. No one likes them that much and we got at least five delivered to us. We started throwing them out, we were so sick of them. Some people really appreciate the food delivery, but I personally found after my loss that cooking was kind of therapeutic. Following a recipe and stepwise instructions for an hour helped me to feel a little more human and a little less helpless. But I wasn&#39;t emotionally (or physically) ready to menu-plan or grocery shop, so I got very excited about Blue Apron. Any meal delivery service is kind of ideal for this kind of mindset-- the foresight and shopping parts of the equation are removed, and then you can just arrange your ingredients into a meal you would have otherwise ordered pizza for. It was a nice way to feel mildly productive-- Blue Apron gift cards were a useful way for people to help us out after the lasagna delivery portion of outreach had kind of passed.</p>

<ol>
<li>DO SAY: &quot;I&#39;m sorry.&quot; &quot;I can&#39;t imagine what you are going through.&quot; (Unless you have had a parallel experience, in which case sharing your own experience might be supportive.) &quot;Here is a specific offer of ways I can assist you during this time.&quot; </li>
</ol>

<p>DO NOT SAY: 
- Anything that dismisses or attempts to diminish their sense of loss or grief. 
- Anything that even approaches complaining about your own pregnancy or living children-- they would trade places with you in a heartbeat
A lot of the other things are situational or specific to the person-- some people want to hear things like, &quot;You&#39;ll have another baby.&quot; Some people find that upsetting, because no one can actually guarantee that. </p>

<ol>
<li>This is another thing that will differ from person to person, but for me, I was really unprepared for how much loss would fuck up my baby fever-- I feel an urgent desperation to be pregnant, and it can sometimes feel like no one who can help understands the crisis mode that I am in. Every day that I&#39;m not pregnant feels like torture. I wish that someone in the hospital could have told me to expect that, and I wish that all my healthcare providers were willing to act based on this urgency to come up with a plan to help me achieve pregnancy again in the wake of my loss. I don&#39;t know how to suggest to you resources which could remedy this problem, though. I know in the hospital their goal was literally to get me through the one day where I had to deliver my dead baby. But the months of agony as I&#39;ve watched my hormones remain messed up has been almost as excruciating with considerably less support, and that&#39;s been really hard for me. If I could change one thing about the loss community, it would be to increase emphasis on assisting with TTC, along with assisting with grief and with decision making when given terrible news about a pregnancy.</li>

I will not mentally be ready probably until after the new year. I just need time to get over this but there will always be the constant fear that it might happen again. I was considering seeing if I could go right to like IVF or IUI but I don't know if they will do that. At least next time I will get an ultrasound as soon as I get a positive test  to make sure it is in the right place. Sorry this is long and rambling. ",[],,t1_dnp79rq,False,0,[],False,"<div class=""md""><p>I was discharged today after my surgery. Currently home and trying to relax with the dogs. My family has been really good. My parents drove the two hours yesterday from my home state as soon as they heard about the surgery and they are taking turns keeping us company. This was going to be their first grandchild and I am devastated for them and feel like I did something wrong. I don&#39;t think I will believe it no matter how much people say nothing I could have done could have prevented this. I am still in the numbness of grief and processing. Luckily I will not have to go back to work this upcoming week. I am a teacher and could not physically handle being on my feet all day or emotionally handle being around children. </p>

In July I didn't think I would at all feel anything in regards to it, and instead was thinking of all the social events I can and would be participating in because I'm not pregnant (let alone 9 months pregnant).

My husband sounds similar to yours.  I had thrown out the idea of testing for sperm motility, but he pointed out that we did have 5 pregnancies, so even though they all ended, the issue seems unlikely to be related to sperm quality since they *are* fertilizing the eggs with a good success rate, the resulting fertilized egg simply isn't surviving.  Meanwhile like you, I see it as a neutral data point that doesn't tell us anything one way or another... but I suppose at least we got the initial conception part down?

Can't speak for my husband, but I know I am trying to stay detached from the CP/MCs because I don't want it to become a defining characteristic about me as a person, so I'm just treating them as lousy-but-not-life-changing things that happened to us.

I know many of us can relate to this. When I was pregnant last time, I had a friend who was a few weeks behind me.

She never let me know about the rest of her pregnancy, or even that she had the baby. My sister mentioned once she had the birth. She's texted me a few times here and there to check-in, especially once my FIL died - she knows that things have been hard. 

She texted me the other day to ask if I went to a mutual friend‚Äôs wedding, I said.... I didn't even know the friend was engaged. I think maybe our friend just didn't want to share her news with me while I was dealing with all this crap? I don‚Äôt know, it kind of hurt my feelings but I understand that this is weird, and some people may not know how navigate this and be my friend. I get that.

I was a little caught off guard but I appreciated it? I just don't know how to respond. I feel like it's not good enough for me to say ""this is me shit, not you shit, and I'm sorry.""

And while that's a TAD better from the changes, my sciatica is killing me.

I don&#39;t feel like this is enough (even though I got pregnant last time by accident with sex once in my fertile time haha). I&#39;ve been temping this month so I know I ovulated...I think? Small dip then higher consistently for the last 5 days. My cm wasn&#39;t looking particularly fertile though, and I didn&#39;t get a positive opk so I&#39;m just kinda meh about the whole thing. I&#39;m 5dpo today so I&#39;ll know by next week. My luteal phase was only 10 days last month. If my cycle is 28 days like last month my chart says I should get an 11 day luteal phase. </p>

<p>Next month I want to try smep, but my sex drive has tanked recently and I just don&#39;t know if I can be bothered. Can I just have the baby I was supposed to have?</p>

<p>Sorry for the word vomit, just getting everything down helps a bit sometimes.</p>

She tried to be cordial I could tell. But she sent the office a christmas card with her kid all over it and they put it up on the fridge. I threw that shit in the garbage when no one was looking. I'm not getting assaulted every time I go in the break room. 

At some point she also asked if I wanted to see her daughter's picture's from her first day at the playground. I said no. She looked so confused and assumed I misheard (because who would say no) and asked again. I said no again. 

After that I felt bad so I sent her an email letting her know, no, I didn't want to see her kid doing all the same shit my stillborn kid would be doing and that was the reason. If anything I am sure that made her feel worse but maybe sometime people need to be hit over the head with an ounce of the horribleness I feel (felt) all the time. 

No real advice just sympathy on how much it sucks and you aren't alone. Since she knows, I think it is okay to shoot her an email like I did.

I will preface this answer by saying that I have a history of anxiety so things may be different for me, but here's the entirely honest answer: I still don't. I hope that instead of freaking you out it helps if 1) you get to a place that I never did or 2) you feel less alone if like me you never get to that place either. 

I was a *hot mess* my first trimester. Thankfully I was under the care of an amazing RE who let me come in for weekly scans. I cried and panicked before each one. Like tears the night before and more tears while waiting for her to come in with the wand. Each time I got a renewed sense of hope and ""holy shit, this is still happening."" My goal was to not stress about things more than 20% of the time, but to allow myself to be anxious when I was. Giving myself that space really helped. My husband shared a lot of the same worry, and it was helpful to talk to him about mine. He also never judged me for freaking out/crying hysterically, which really helped. 

I thought things might get better in the second trimester, but more worry came instead. There will be a point where your first trimester symptoms go away but you can't yet feel movement. Holy hell that was hard for me. Buying a doppler helped, and I tried to limit my use to once a week. At this point I was only going to the OB monthly (because somehow I graduated from an amazing RE who treated me like a fucking special snowflake (lol) to an OB where I was just a Plain Jane with a normal, boring pregnancy). The dropoff in appointments coupled with the lack of symptoms and movement was a really hard place to be in. Things that helped: talking to my husband, using the doppler occasionally, having the NT ultrasound spaced out so it was 2 weeks between my 4 week OB appointment, and getting the NIPT - extra confirmation that things were OK at least from a chromosome standpoint (I've had losses due to chromosomes so this helped me). 

The anatomy scan was a great help too. Again, I tried to schedule this for a decent interval between OB appointments. At that point (19+3) I was starting to feel some movement, which helped. I can say that each appointment and scan provided a few days worth of natural high that I was able to ride before the anxiety crept back in. 

I think from the anatomy scan until around 24 weeks I was constantly freaking out about incompetent cervix. I felt like none of my providers were concerned despite my lengthy surgical history, and that stressed me out. I stopped going to the gym for a while because I was paranoid. Once I hit the 24 week mark I figured IC would have shown its ugly face so then I just tried to get to 28 weeks in one piece because preterm birth outcomes are better at that point. Once there, I set my sights on 32 weeks, then 34.

I had my shower around 31 weeks and *lost. my mind.* I thought I was jinxing things by having a shower or celebrating. I realized that somehow 31 weeks had gone by where I mostly had been waiting for the other shoe to drop and holding my breath that it wouldn't. I have bonded with this baby, but nowhere like I had with my second pregnancy, at least at that point. I couldn't even bring myself to talk to him for a while, not really sure why. Setting up the nursery came in very, very small steps. There were tears at each one. First we painted an accent wall. That was OK because if it didn't work out we could paint it back or just keep it. Then we traded out a piece of furniture for a dresser that can be used as a changing table. That was fine too. Then we got rid of the guest bed. That was a bit harder because where will guests sleep if we end up without a baby and can host people again? Then it was hard to do laundry. If I take the tags off things, I can't return them. What if this doesn't work out and I have all this stuff I can't return or give back to the people who gifted it to me? I cried so many tears and started little by little. 

I still worry that he might just die in there before I give birth, but I've come to embrace that if he doesn't I want to be ready for him so things are pretty ready around our house. I still wake up every morning and have a mini panic attack until I feel him move (part of my morning routine is to drink water and wait for him to wake up), but once that happens I can go about my day pretty normally. I think I started talking to him more and more around 28-30 weeks and now I feel much more attached to him. It took a really long time though, and that's one thing I wish I had done differently. As much as I want to protect myself from the devastation of loss, I really don't think it's going to make a difference at this point - I'll be crushed regardless so I might as well invest some of myself into this little guy who deserves all the love in the world. 

I think I'm just rambling at this point, so props if you've made it this far. I guess the TL;DR is I never felt secure in this pregnancy but I've learned to roll with it.

You have to remember that its not just about showing up or not. The ENTIRE conversation at dinner will likely be about pregnancy and babies. Its not exactly like its a topic you can avoid at a dinner like that.

As you get closer to your EDD, it is harder to hear that talk from anyone, but especially someone whose due date is so close to yours.

A good friend would understand this. Give her your gift and even go out to dinner with JUST her if you want. But a group will be harder.
