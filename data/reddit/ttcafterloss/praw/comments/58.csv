Surprisingly this isn't a ""my husband spilled the beans when I wasn't ready"" rant like I'd expected.

Obviously mother's day is the perfect day to rub it into my face that I'm the only adult woman at a family dinner that isn't a mother with living children. Thanks for that.

My husband's grandma and I have always had a rocky relationship. From the day my husband and I announced we were getting married and she begged him (right in front of me while he had his arm around me) not to go through with it, I've been quietly tolerating her snide jabs for the sake of keeping the peace.

However, we have told her about some of our pregnancies and their subsequent losses because my husband is really close to his Grandpa and wanted him to know.

At the start of dinner, my husband's uncle called for all the ladies (and me by name because I didn't get up) to go and be served for dinner. So I did - when I got to the kitchen where they were serving dinner but my husband's grandma insisted it was ""mother's first"" so I waited until the end semi-hiding in the adjoining dining room, until called again by the uncle.

As soon as I joined the queue however, my husband's grandma who was still in the kitchen looks up at me and says ""Excuse me! It's mothers first and you're not a mother."" I almost broke down in tears right there in the middle of the kitchen. At this point I'm painfully aware that I'm the only woman at this dinner who does not have living children but it sure as shit doesn't help to have it rubbed in my face.

His aunt tried to help, and I know her heart was in the right place, when she said ""she's at least a mother of her fur babies"" to try and defuse the situation. But fuck if that didn't just rub salt in the wound. I don't hold it against her so much because I know she was trying to give me an ""out"", but... ouch. 

I'm hurt so I told my husband I wanted to go home and why. My husband is FURIOUS (more upset than I was) and his mother wants to know why we're leaving at the start of dinner when I'd been fine until moments earlier. So he tells her, and she is quite appalled by it but I insisted that it didn't go further because everyone else was having a pretty good time and I don't like making a huge scene. I even managed to hold my tears in until we were on the highway home.

Part of me feels like maybe I'm hormonal and overreacting. My husband and MIL assure me that I'm not and she was definitely crossing the line with that statement.

I thought a card or some flowers would be good for me; and then we could take his mom the sheet cake I baked and look at the pretty arrangement he ordered for her (and signed my name to!). 

He said he understood, asked what kind of flowers I liked. Got a little huffy Saturday when I asked if we should go to the florist because, ""You're making it hard to surprise you!""

We went over to his mom's today after I finished baking and putting away groceries. His mother was lovely; made me decaf tea, gushed over the ultrasound, scolded me roundly for eating a bologna sandwich this week and having Michelin starred sushi in week 6...

And now it's 7pm and I turn to him and say, ""You didn't get me anything for Mother's Day, did you?""

His face fell. ""I forgot.""

So now I'm in the bathroom because I ""don't feel well."" Hoping the sound of the shower drowns my pathetic little sobbing sounds I can't seem to hold back. 

He's folding my laundry for me.

In addition to what the others have said, I'll add that it's not unusual for it to take a while to grieve.

At the same time, it's not unusual for women to feel a strong desire to be pregnant again soon after their loss.  If that's the case for your wife, you can reassure her that it's common and okay too.

Pregnancy loss is tough on couples because each person handles grief in their own way and at their own pace.  They also may have different feelings about if/when to try again. It's inevitable that couples get out of sync, and it's not uncommon to feel disconnected/alone.

I'm wondering if:
a) stage 1 labour (pitocin contractions) will be similarly painful this time around (I didn't have an epidural last time and I'm hoping to avoid it this time) - like, do pitocin contractions feel the same even though the baby is smaller?

b) if this labour is likely to be faster (like a typical second labour) given that my cervix has dilated before, or if it won't count because the baby was so much smaller than term

<p>Sending you love this weekend. </p>

I don't think the decision to end the pregnancy will ever not weigh heavily on me.  I still feel judged by some people.  I still wish I could have met my son.  I still have ""what if"" moments.   

But I've gone over our decision many times in my head.  I know what suffering we would have risked for him, if we'd made another decision.  Giving him a good death, where he was warm and safe in his mama's belly, where he could pass without pain, and the last thing he heard was our voices and mama's heart beat was the last thing we could do for him.  As many times as I've thought about it, I can never bring myself to feel that we should have put him through suffering instead.  I won't say that there's not still some guilt or questioning, but that's how peace looks for me, and it's taken time to get here.  

There are quite a few of us here who've had TFMR losses, and the grief is just as devastating as any other type of loss.  Our sadness and grief is just as deep as anyone else's.  And we have a right to be sad.

After my loss, reading other people's stories helped me a lot.

Both are helpful, non-judgmental guides for navigating this type of loss.  The former is a short quick read that my husband and I did together.  The latter is a more detailed book.  
Our hospital also connected us with a bereavement counselor who we/I have seen monthly (free).  And we've also gone regularly to a parent support group for general perinatal loss.  (The closest one specifically for TFMR is 2 hrs away from us, but you might live closer to one.)

Two posts in one day! I'm sorry! But I'm, looking for advice, although I know it's my decision.

We're trying to decide on an obgyn practice/hospital. Practice A I saw after my 2nd loss. They deliver at a slightly closer but smaller hospital. I have had some bad experiences with a nurse and nurse practitioner (I think there's a post from Dec when the one NP made me cry). I do like the midwife I have seen, but she's an office midwife and doesn't do deliveries. I've scheduled my next two appointments, one with an ob and one with the np I don't love. I'm a bit frustrated that I'll be 24 weeks before I even meet someone that would deliver me (we're using midwives for delivery). 

Practice B I've just had one appointment. The nurse doing the intake appointment kind of treated me like an idiot, but the midwife I saw for 5 minutes was super nice and struck me as my type of person. They deliver at a women and babies hospital, and my peditrican has privileges there but not at the hospital that A delivers at. They also have a c-section rate thats almost half of Practice A's.

How do I make this decision? Practice B strikes me as a bit of a baby mill. But maybe that means they are more experienced if something goes wrong? Is not liking two people at Practice A (who wouldn't ever be involved I delivery) a factor I should even consider?

My husband says its basically a flip of a coin. Neither practice seems very sensitive to my loss history, or very concerned about my need to be induced due to super high BP with my 1st - which are the most important things to me this time around.

On top of that he has his own medical issues that we are dealing with right now.  Thanks for listening </p>

I went to my first ultrasound at 10+4. The day beforehand my husband was requested to go out of town for work, last minute...just for 1 day - appointment day. We were like ""eh they'll be a lot of appointments, its ok.""

So I went alone.

Went in for my ultrasound and they started with measurements and the tech was all chipper and said ""10+4, right on the dot!"" and I was like ooooh, all excited. Then she got a bit somber...she kinda patted my shoulder and told me ""Honey...there isn't a heartbeat."". She asked if I wanted her to point that out and I said yes, so she showed me the spot that was the heart, that wasn't moving. I started crying and she gave me tissues. She then told me she had to take some measurements and write them on the scan - a heads up in case I didn't want to keep looking. But I did. I watched her write NFHR (no fetal heartrate) and take all the measurements...I looked at our baby with the little arms and legs and just cried. (The doctor says due to the growth that the heart had likely stopped within the last 24 hours). I was moved to a doctors office (instead of being sent back to the waiting room like they usually do between scan and doctor). When I saw him he started talking about options with me and it was so surreal. But they were all so gentle and amazing. And seemed to truly care.

I left, crying while walking by all these pregnant women in the waiting room. I got to my car and called my mom (my husband was unavailable due to the work trip). I cried and cried and sat in my car for awhile. Finally I calmed down and drove home. I messaged my boss that I wasn't coming back to work and I crawled into bed and cried more. 

In between 2 meetings, my husband texted asking me how things were and I was being vague. I didn't want him to get that news before a big presentation. But he knows me well and KNEW something was up, so he stepped out and called me. I had to tell him that the baby had died.

*2nd loss* 

My husband and I both went to my 10 week scan...and I knew IMMEDIATELY that the baby was gone (because I had seen the previous baby at 10+4 and this baby was way too small). He was measuring 7+3 with no heartbeat. Right away I saw it, and the tech was the same lady and also could tell that *I* knew..........but I looked at my husband and he was trying to figure out what was on the screen. He looked at me and I had to say ""Babe...its not good. The baby isn't alive."" His face fell and that was harder than going to the 1st scan alone and getting bad news (for me). 

*3rd and 4th losses*

These were CPs so I knew pretty quickly that they weren't working out.

*5th loss*

I got a positive at home, went in for bloodwork...before they could even call me with results I was bleeding. And the results were VERY low so we assumed miscarriage. I bled for a few days (over Thanksgiving) and then went in for another beta to be sure. The morning of the beta, I tested just cause I wanted to see the negative and be prepared. It was BLAZING positive. Then I went through a couple weeks of every other day blood draws...and eventually a D&C....and then methotrexate. Because it was ectopic. So we kinda knew all along :(

1) Is it too much to expect a good friend *not* to just BCC me on his birth announcement? Along with three photos of his baby and the happy family all together? Like, what was going through his head as he typed my email into the BCC? ""Well, aeb lost her baby but she'll still be psyched for me!"" Obviously, I'm glad he told me that the baby was born--I would have been hurt if he hadn't told me at all. But I would have really, *really* appreciated it if he'd just taken an extra 2 minutes to send me a separate email. Maybe with some acknowledgment of our loss? Or at least just a different tone? He was one of the first people I told I was pregnant, and his wife was just finishing up her first trimester at that time--we talked a lot about how pregnancy is so anxiety-provoking and how it's so terrifying to think of something going wrong. And he was one of the first people I told when we got the Trisomy 18 diagnosis. And he's a doctor, so he knows exactly what that is and how terrible it is. So...I don't get it. Oh and also they named their kid my favorite boy name. Not that they knew and not that they shouldn't be able to do that but...salt in the wound.

2) Rant number two! You know what's been really grating on me lately? When people who have new babies say shit like, ""We're finally a family!"" The more I come to terms with our difficulties getting pregnant, the more this bullshit gets to me. You don't need a baby to be a family! I have a family too: my husband and [my little orange cat](https://i.imgur.com/DiV4fTk.jpg).

3) Ever since my D&E in February, I haven't allowed myself to think about how far along I'd be. I honestly have no idea what week I'd be at now. But I'm realizing that even though I'm not thinking about it, I'm still aware of it. Before, it was the pregnant women who appeared 2nd trimester-y who bothered me most. Now, it's the big 3rd trimester ones. Before, seeing babies made me sad, but in a wistful kind of way. Now, it feels like a knife to the heart. I think about the daughter I should be having this summer, what she would look like, what she would smell like, what it would feel like to hold her. I guess not letting myself think about my parallel life hasn't prevented me from continuing to play out that life in the back of my mind. I guess part of me will continue to watch that parallel life like a neverending movie reel for the rest of my actual life--even if I go on to have other children. In 5 years, I'll think about her starting kindergarten. In 13 years, I'll wonder how our relationship would be--what kind of teenager would she have been? In 18 years, I'll wonder what she'd look like all grown up. I know everyone here can relate.

To end on a positive note, I got a positive OPK last night. This is my second cycle since my D&E, and both seem to have been ovulatory. I'm so thankful that my body is behaving somewhat normally. I'm rebuilding trust in my body, bit by bit. I'm going to take that bit of encouragement and hold it close.

Hope you all have a good weekend and that you're having as nice weather as we are up here in Boston.

You can still use it though I guess? It might screw with how it calculates your temperatures in the future though because their algorithm is not designed to account for pregnancy vs cycles where you're ovulating.

I have both a tempdrop and an Ava bracelet, but since I've moved on to IVF I stopped using both of them. I think I might start using the Ava again if I ever get pregnant though, for the pregnancy tracking. I recently got a Fitbit charge, and I've been using that to track sleep. 

So for just temperature, I think the Tempdrop is great. The main downside is that its app only reports temperatures but doesn't actually chart for you. The only charting app it syncs with is Ovuview, which is Android only. You can also manually input your temperatures into other apps, but when I last used it, temperatures would retroactively update every few days based on your pattern, so syncing is nice so you're not constantly having to update previous temps.

The Ava app was not awesome either, but they were continuously updating it and trying to make improvements. The main reason I don't recommend the Ava over the tempdrop, is cost. It costs so much money! And you have to charge it every night, unlike the tempdrop. However, if you have the disposable income where the extra cost isn't a hardship, then it's no unreasonable to get the Ava instead. \(Which is clearly my situation; I like supporting this industry and want to encourage companies to make better and cheaper versions of these over time\).",[],,t1_dys5slo,False,0,[],False,"<div class=""md""><p>The Tempdrop only reports temperature, unless something has changed since I last used mine.

I'm 31 and have heterozygous compound MTHFR - I had no idea about this until recently so I was just taking regular Materna prenatals when I conceived both times. I was on birth control for 10+ years prior to TTC. I also have very irregular cycles (29-47 days) - I was in the process of getting tested for possible PCOS when I got pregnant the second time. 

My first pregnancy after 4 months of trying ended at MC at 6 weeks. My second pregnancy after a 6 month break and another 4 months TTC went to term although my baby has Down Syndrome (diagnosed at birth - all prenatal screenings came back normal). I know the link between MTHFR and DS hasn't been 100% proven or disproven but in preparation for another pregnancy I've switched to Smarty Pants and Naturelo prenatals. We will not be TTC until at least January but I want to hopefully get my folate levels optimal.  

When TTC my son I used the easy@home ovulation tests that are reasonably cheap on Amazon. Temping never worked for me although I did track it here and there. I used the Ovia and Fertility Friend apps - I found Ovia slightly more helpful.

Tearing blue eyes sailor-mean

Thank you so much for your email, and your voicemail. I appreciate your time in participating in our research. I also want to apologize for the errors in the survey that you found, particularly having to answer questions about living children after having experienced a stillbirth. That was absolutely an error in how we designed the branching logic of the survey, and it has now been corrected. I appreciate your bringing it to our attention. Of course we tried to catch all of these errors prior to the survey ""going live"" and make sure that women were only asked the questions that were relevant to their experiences, but we clearly made a few mistakes in that process. I hope that these mistakes should all be addressed for women who take the survey in the future. 


Thank you again for your time in completing the survey and for reaching out about these errors. Please let me know if you have any further questions or if there is anything else with which I can be of assistance.

For me, the main reasons to switch over to Wondfos were:

1) Cost. Because the Wondfos are so cheap, I can use them twice a day during the period I think I'm most likely to ovulate. 

2) Equal performance compared to Clearblue. For me, the whole ""High fertility"" blinking smiley face thing didn't work out so well. That's just my body. And I also found that the Clearblue and Wondfo OPKs were similar in terms of their sensitivity for detecting the LH surge.

3) I actually like that the Wondo OPKs don't use a digital readout. This way, I can see the LH line darken as I approach my actual LH surge (although obviously, this depends on how dilute the urine is, how often I'm testing, etc).

My second one was similar - we saw a heartbeat at 6 weeks, then nothing at 11. Baby had stopped growing around 6.5 weeks.

I took different time off for different losses. My first was a CP (though at that point I had no idea what that even was, I just knew ""I'm pregnant and bleeding very heavily and this is terrifying."") and I took that day off to get into the doctor and then just cry at home. Thankfully it was a Friday. I work in education and the following Monday was the first day of the academic year so I went back and pretended like nothing happened. 

My second loss was a MMC diagnosed on a Thursday at 11 weeks. I had just gotten back from a long vacation, went in for my first day back at work, and left about 2 hours into the day for my OB appointment. I came back around lunch time to gather my things and go home because I couldn't for the life of me stop crying. I wasn't bleeding, but I couldn't function (I had no idea that MMC was a thing. It was a shitty learning experience). I took the following day (Friday) off for a D&C and returned Monday. I took a half day the following Thursday for an emergency second D&C due to hemorrhage and went back to work the following day. Thankfully that was the last day of the year before winter break so I got 2 weeks of after that. I found this sub during that break :) 

My third loss happened right around the end of the academic year. My role is heavily involved in graduation so I couldn't miss time as I'm responsible for clearing students to graduate on a very tight timeline. I found out about the loss (MMC at 7 weeks) on a Tuesday (1.5 weeks before graduation) and did NOT want another D&C after my horrible first experience (awake, hemorrhage, awake for round 2). I took Tuesday off to eat cookies on my couch, but went to work Wednesday and Thursday. The distraction was welcome, but I think I was in a different place because it wasn't my first rodeo and I expected it to happen again. By Friday nothing was happening and I realized there wasn't a single day I could take off for another week so I was running the risk of having a miscarriage at work. I really wanted the tissue tested, so I opted for the D&C that day, which thankfully was done under anesthesia at my RE's office. Best decision ever, especially because we got answers (tetraploidy). I returned to work on Monday and only had post D&C bleeding to deal with, rather than passing tissue in a public restroom, which I can only imagine would have been traumatic. 

I'm very lucky to have a supportive supervisor who let me take the days with little to no notice and without pressuring me for specifics or making me feel badly about being out. I also have a very good sick leave policy so my days off were fully paid. I understand that not everyone has that so it might be a factor in deciding how long to take. Regardless if you go to work or stay home in the interim between now and your D&C, please be gentle with yourself.

I just took your survey and found some issues with it that should be addressed.

First of all, if you are asked if you gave birth and answer yes, you are later asked about your live birth. Why does this not take into account for stillbirths? Not every person who gave birth has a living child.  Your survey even asks how many living children and how many pregnancies total, but it does not then take into account for those actual numbers. 

Also, we are asked if we've had a miscarriage and then asked at what gestation. I have had 5 losses and decided to list them all in that one field, but it does not seem your survey takes into account that people can have multiple losses. 

Also, your questions regarding ""experiences"" during both pregnancy and birth do not have an option to say ""none of the above"". Your survey requires that we choose an answer, so to answer ""none"" we have to choose ""decline to answer"". This is not correct data collection.

I am not sure if you can address these now that your survey has been out for awhile, but they are issues.

Thank you.

My timeline is:

Twins lost at 24 weeks, August 2016

MC/Ectopic at 8 weeks, February 2017

MMC at 12 weeks (stopped at 8 weeks), August 2017

God, I was (and still am) so furious. Why us? How can crackheads and junkies have babies at the drop of a hat, but not us? After the MMC, I had some basic RPL testing which showed no medical issues. Official diagnoses was 'bad luck, keep trying'.

TW: current pregnancy-

I'm now 32 weeks pregnant, after conceiving the cycle after our last loss. I'm not counting my chickens yet, but so far everything is going well.

I have everything crossed for you. I remember telling my husband when I got this most recent positive test, it just really hit me how different it is now for us, than for most other people. Instead of excitement, it's ""I'm pregnant. Again. I wonder how long it will last this time?""

I'm so sad and angry for you and me and all of the other people here who have had that excitement and sense of hope stolen from us.

But I also believe that I will have a living baby one day soon, and I believe you will too. Best of luck xx
",[],,t1_dyooh2b,False,0,[],False,"<div class=""md""><p>Your story is so familiar, I&#39;m so sorry this keeps happening to you.</p>

<p>My timeline is:</p>

<p>Twins lost at 24 weeks, August 2016</p>

<p>MC/Ectopic at 8 weeks, February 2017</p>

<p>MMC at 12 weeks (stopped at 8 weeks), August 2017</p>

<p>God, I was (and still am) so furious. Why us? How can crackheads and junkies have babies at the drop of a hat, but not us? After the MMC, I had some basic RPL testing which showed no medical issues. Official diagnoses was &#39;bad luck, keep trying&#39;.</p>

But at least compared to our experience, it kind of seems like you've gotten subpar care all around.  

Our situation was different, but I suspect that our genetic counselors wouldn't have given the same advice.  

It wasn't until my son was diagnosed (not an aneuploidy) that I learned about the caveats of NIPT.  I'd definitely do it for future pregnancies. But I had the impression that it was more reliable than it actually was. It's better than a quad screen, but not as accurate as CVS or amnio. And in general, the more rare the condition is, the less accurate it is. (So accuracy for T13 < T18 < T21.)

NIPT's are also now offering tests for sex chromosome aneuploidies and a few microdeletions--but those tests are more or less useless. The companies themselves don't know how often their results are correct or wrong...so no matter what result you get, you don't know whether or not to believe it. (You wouldn't think it would be legal to sell a test like that....but it is, apparently.)  

I recommend  [this article](https://www.necir.org/2014/12/13/prenatal-testing/) from the New England Center for Investigative reporting for a good layperson's summary of NIPT.  If you really want the gritty details, [this post](https://thednaexchange.com/2014/11/02/guest-post-nips-microdeletions-macro-questions/) , written by a genetic counselor for other professionals, gets into the stats for the newer microdeletion tests, and why they can't be used at this stage. I've even written to one company to ask about their performance statistics.  The trisomy numbers are eyebrow raising, and for microdeletions, they were like, ""We don't even have numbers for those tests.""  Nice, huh?
  
So, even with the supporting ultrasound information, I think our genetic counselors would have ordered CVS/amnio, just because it's your baby's life, and a diagnostic genetic test is the gold standard.  (To be clear, I'm not suggesting that your baby didn't have T18.  I'm just suggesting that your genetic counselor's advice might be worth questioning.  And if you do NIPT in the future, it's good to be aware of these issues.)  

With regard to follow-up testing, there was a remote chance of us being carriers for our son's condition.  There are no reported cases of it being inherited (although it's super rare to being with).  In the few cases of somatic mosaicism, patients had the full blown syndrome, which my husband and I obviously do not.  It was also our first pregnancy and first loss.  But even knowing all of that, our genetic counselors encouraged us to get tested.  Both for the peace of mind, and because if it did turn out to be heritable, it's something that can be tested for, which would put IVF w/ PGS on the table.

In our case, insurance covered it.  If your insurance doesn't cover it outright, maybe you can petition them?  I know from family experience that insurance companies are a royal PITA.  But a $3000 test is much less expensive for them than a second pregnancy ending in a D&C/induction.  (Or maybe they'd summon the test results, and you'd get your answer that way.)  

I'm so sorry you're dealing with all of this.  Not sure if your area has a TFMR support group (our closest is an 1-2 hrs away).  But if you have one, or even a general perinatal loss group, you might be able to get recommendations from people there on other doctors/genetic counselors....",[],,t1_dyo3drh,False,0,[],False,"<div class=""md""><p>I understand being constrained by insurance and what providers are in your area.

<p>Our situation was different, but I suspect that our genetic counselors wouldn&#39;t have given the same advice.  </p>

<p>It wasn&#39;t until my son was diagnosed (not an aneuploidy) that I learned about the caveats of NIPT.  I&#39;d definitely do it for future pregnancies. But I had the impression that it was more reliable than it actually was. It&#39;s better than a quad screen, but not as accurate as CVS or amnio. And in general, the more rare the condition is, the less accurate it is. (So accuracy for T13 &lt; T18 &lt; T21.)</p>

<p>NIPT&#39;s are also now offering tests for sex chromosome aneuploidies and a few microdeletions--but those tests are more or less useless. The companies themselves don&#39;t know how often their results are correct or wrong...so no matter what result you get, you don&#39;t know whether or not to believe it. (You wouldn&#39;t think it would be legal to sell a test like that....but it is, apparently.)  </p>

<p>I recommend  <a href=""https://www.necir.org/2014/12/13/prenatal-testing/"">this article</a> from the New England Center for Investigative reporting for a good layperson&#39;s summary of NIPT.  If you really want the gritty details, <a href=""https://thednaexchange.com/2014/11/02/guest-post-nips-microdeletions-macro-questions/"">this post</a> , written by a genetic counselor for other professionals, gets into the stats for the newer microdeletion tests, and why they can&#39;t be used at this stage. I&#39;ve even written to one company to ask about their performance statistics.  The trisomy numbers are eyebrow raising, and for microdeletions, they were like, &quot;We don&#39;t even have numbers for those tests.&quot;  Nice, huh?</p>

<p>So, even with the supporting ultrasound information, I think our genetic counselors would have ordered CVS/amnio, just because it&#39;s your baby&#39;s life, and a diagnostic genetic test is the gold standard.  (To be clear, I&#39;m not suggesting that your baby didn&#39;t have T18.  I&#39;m just suggesting that your genetic counselor&#39;s advice might be worth questioning.  And if you do NIPT in the future, it&#39;s good to be aware of these issues.)  </p>

<p>With regard to follow-up testing, there was a remote chance of us being carriers for our son&#39;s condition.  There are no reported cases of it being inherited (although it&#39;s super rare to being with).  In the few cases of somatic mosaicism, patients had the full blown syndrome, which my husband and I obviously do not.  It was also our first pregnancy and first loss.  But even knowing all of that, our genetic counselors encouraged us to get tested.  Both for the peace of mind, and because if it did turn out to be heritable, it&#39;s something that can be tested for, which would put IVF w/ PGS on the table.</p>

<p>In our case, insurance covered it.  If your insurance doesn&#39;t cover it outright, maybe you can petition them?  I know from family experience that insurance companies are a royal PITA.  But a $3000 test is much less expensive for them than a second pregnancy ending in a D&amp;C/induction.  (Or maybe they&#39;d summon the test results, and you&#39;d get your answer that way.)  </p>

<p>I&#39;m so sorry you&#39;re dealing with all of this.  Not sure if your area has a TFMR support group (our closest is an 1-2 hrs away).  But if you have one, or even a general perinatal loss group, you might be able to get recommendations from people there on other doctors/genetic counselors....</p>

My history...6 pregnancies:

* MMC found at 10+4, passed away within the previous 24 hours
* MMC found at 10+3, passed at 7+3
* CP (5 weeks)
* CP (4+2)
* Ectopic 
* Live birth

After all our testing, we didn't get much useful info. And unfortunately ~75%+ of people with repeat loss do not find an answer. =(

We did find a few small things that we adjusted...but my RE didn't think they were the cause. And I still had loss afterwards so I doubt it, too.

* My Prolactin was on the high end of normal, but not outside the range. We did attempt to lower it with meds and it came down a tiny bit. But one of the biggest things high Prolactin does is actually keep you from conceiving, and I didn't have that issue.
* My CD21 progesterone tests were consistently low, but this is *likely* explained by poor egg quality not much else. I did start on Progesterone supplements post-ovulation and had slightly better numbers. But still had losses after.
* My karyotyping had an abnormal result but nobody could decide if it was impacting my fertility. It is not a known fertility issue like translocations/etc. The doctors suggested testing my parents and we found that my mom has it/passed it to me. It was deemed an unlikely cause since she has it and was 3/3 with pregnancies.
* We also genetically tested our 2nd baby and found no reason for his passing.

I literally was put on a ""try again and we'll see how it goes"" plan. 

I've had a *slew* of testing done and can share all of it with you if you wish. But my biggest suggestions are:

* CD3 testing
* Near surge testing, to compare to CD3 results
* Thyroid testing...and ALL of them, not just TSH and T3 (so ask for T3, T3RU, T4, and TSH)
* CD21 testing on multiple cycles

Thyroid issues are one of the most common issues related to loss and a great place to start when looking into a reason.

Unfortunately, a large percentage of repeat loss never has a reason attached. Thankfully, for those who don't find a reason, there is also a huge percentage who go on to have live births (80%!). Of course, the pain, time, and continual loss is hard while you wait and continue to try for that.

Baby is measuring 100% in the centre of the growth chart for normal. They're estimating he's around 2.2lbs. Fluid is great.

My BP is bordering too high so they're keeping an eye on that. They also found leukocytes in my urine so they sent it off for testing as it might indicate an infection. Not too worried, but we'll see...

Then I nearly lost my shit. They sent me to see a registrar (someone training to be a consultant specialist). She just took one look at my notes and said everything looked good, I could go home.

I just went ""that's it??"" and she said ""yep!"" I just started bawling. I told them how inadequate I feel my care has been up to now. I've not seen my midwife in 10 weeks. When I have seen her she's very dismissive of any questions or concerns I have. I was told I could see the same consultant when I came to the hospital and that's never happened. Nobody seems willing to answers any of my questions. 

So she got a consultant for me. He was a lovely bloke, had a chat about how I've been feeling. He's arranging for me to have a different midwife and to see the same consultant every time I go to the hospital. I'll also be having growth scans every 2 weeks from 30 weeks. I'm feeling slightly better, but I've taken the rest of the day off work because I'm just so damn stressed out and anxious. I just need this pregnancy to hurry up.

I had an MMC last year. It was discovered during an ultrasound at 10 weeks. Tried the pills but ultimately I had to have a D&C. No living children, no other pregnancies. I felt very traumatized by the whole thing.

This. Exactly this. I think at some point, the majority of people who experienced pregnancy loss feel this way.

Welcome to our sub. I am sorry you need us, but glad you found us. Unfortunately (and fortunately) so many here can relate - to your loss, your grief, waiting to try, and the issues that come with a pregnancy after loss (PAL).

I would say the majority of people are nervous/anxious during PAL. It's very normal to feel that way. It's hard to go through, seems unfair, seems like you should try to snap out of it, etc...but its normal and understandable. It's hard to be as excited because you now worry more and know what its like to lose your baby. You lose the naive happiness you had before loss...and many are bothered by how others act about their PAL.  But for most people there is definitely still excitement and joy involved! Its different, for sure, but you will likely still have many moments of happiness and fun surrounding a subsequent pregnancy. Most people find that once they pass their loss milestone it becomes easier, but that isn't always true either. Either way, a PAL will be hard (and very different) but can still be joyful! 

We do have an area in this sub for those who are PAL - a daily Alumni Thread where you can express anxieties, share happy moments, etc. It has gotten many of us through PAL!

We also have a weekly Waiting to Try thread on Wednesdays for those who aren't actively TTC right now.

I haven't yet been pregnant after my loss, so I don't really have specific advice for how to get through these next few weeks until your next ultrasound, but I know that I'm going to be a complete anxious mess once I'm in your shoes too (hopefully someday). A lot of people on this subreddit try to just focus on each day, one at a time, and they use the mantra ""Today, I am pregnant."" Or, ""This is a different pregnancy."" 

Edited to add: I don't believe in trying to kill off hope on preparation for a loss. I do believe in being aware of the fact that loss can happen more than once in a row, but also still holding on to the hope that this time it will work out. The main thing you don't want to do is expect that this will work out. It's the difference between expecting something and feeling entitled to it, versus hoping something will happen but knowing there's a chance it might not. I don't regret the moments of hope, and some joy, I felt during the weeks I was bleeding on and off before I found out I had miscarried.

<p>After my cramps stopped, I learned that the belly band (which I&#39;d gotten to cover the top of my jeans to stretch the time before I needed maternity pants) can be doubled up and warn over the belly for support postpartum.   And I thought, &quot;I wish I&#39;d known.&quot;  If things like sneezing, certain movements, etc. hurt, and you have a belly band, you can see if it helps.  </p>

<p>And of course, if you&#39;re concerned about anything, you can also send your doctor a message.  Hope you turn the corner on the cramps soon!</p>

1). Assemble a medical team you trust. Don't be afraid to switch care if you don't feel comfortable.  
2). You have options, even in c-section. Ask questions, and ask about your options. You can opt for just a spinal and skip the epidural. You can get the epidural, you can get freaking general anesthesia. Don't feel forced to do anything.
3). Shame on anyone who suggests that you did something wrong, ""took the easy way out"" (my ass...), or weren't strong enough for a vaginal birth.  What matters is that you do everything you can to try and ensure that you come home with a baby.  If anyone suggests otherwise, shame.

After it was all over, and we didn&#39;t go home with our baby, I can honestly say that it wasn&#39;t what I wanted but it was the best option. Surgery was built up by everyone as a big terrible thing. It doesn&#39;t have to be.<br/>
1). Assemble a medical team you trust. Don&#39;t be afraid to switch care if you don&#39;t feel comfortable.<br/>
2). You have options, even in c-section. Ask questions, and ask about your options. You can opt for just a spinal and skip the epidural. You can get the epidural, you can get freaking general anesthesia. Don&#39;t feel forced to do anything.
3). Shame on anyone who suggests that you did something wrong, &quot;took the easy way out&quot; (my ass...), or weren&#39;t strong enough for a vaginal birth.  What matters is that you do everything you can to try and ensure that you come home with a baby.  If anyone suggests otherwise, shame.  As in, &quot;I&#39;m just happy the baby is alive - we&#39;ve has a previous loss, so that&#39;s what matters to us.&quot;. </p>

Right now, just let yourself feel whatever you need to feel.  It's okay to have hours when you feel devastated.  It's also okay to have hours when you feel like you need a break from feeling sad.  It's okay for you and your husband to feel different things, or do different things to cope.    

The world is divided into two groups: people who've experienced a loss and people haven't.  The latter will make lots of well meaning, but hurtful comments (e.g. ""you're still young"", anything starting with the words ""at least"").  So it's good to seek the support of people who understand.  

Our children's hospital has free bereavement counseling for parents who've lost a child. There are also private therapists who specialize in this.  I'd only had one unsatisfying experience with counseling before my loss, but I found my bereavement counselor very helpful, and saw her for months.   I also attended a local parent peer support group for perinatal loss.  Meeting other parents in person who understood what we were going through made me feel validated and less alone.  

Another thing that made me feel less alone was reading the stories of others.  I found Sherokee Ilse's book *The Prenatal Bombshell* for prenatal diagnoses and the aftermath to be very non-judgmental and helpful for my loss.  (It covered loss, immediate grief, long-term grief, challenges for couples dealing with grief, thinking about getting pregnant again.)   I know she has another one called *Empty Arms: Coping with Miscarriage, Stillbirth and Infant Death* that was updated in 2016 and probably addresses those topics in a context more relevant to your loss of Lillian.  Your library might have it, or you can get it e.g. on Amazon.  

It's normal to have conflicting feelings of wanting to be pregnant again (and guilt about those feeling), and at the same time not feeling ready to try again.  

Physically, there's debate about how long to wait.  For losses <20 weeks, there is no need to wait.   For full-term (vaginal) deliveries the rule of thumb often given is 6-9 months, due to some suggestion that this lowers risk of a subsequent pre-term delivery, etc.  But some studies on better outcomes for waiting are almost 20 years old, and pretty much all of them are observational (i.e. can't prove causation).  So it's not 100% clear that the 6-9 month rule is necessary vs. extra cautious.  (C-sections are a different matter: they require extra healing time to reduce risk of uterine rupture.)  

Emotionally, only you and your husband will know when you're ready to try again.  And you might feel differently day-to-day.  TTC can be a rollercoaster of emotional ups and downs (that's why this subreddit exists) and a subsequent pregnancy comes with more worries and anxieties.  You don't have to be 100% ready before you start TTC again (because that can take time too).  But my OB has had patients who've gotten pregnant earlier than they wanted to, before they were ready, and those pregnancies were emotionally very challenging.  If you know you aren't ready to cope with pregnancy anxieties, it's probably too soon.

<p>Update: called the ob office, and they are saying my referral was only valid if I am currently pregnant. So my insurance started the process, was informed of my loss, then expedited the referral -- for the wrong thing! I am not allowed to see an ob after all, bc oops! my baby fell out of my body. fml.</p>

I think you have a lot of things going on there that may be working with the counselor would help you become emotionally stronger and in a better place. 23 is really really young to have children and especially since you have a boyfriend at the moment. I‚Äôm sure people have children and are unmarried and turn out ok as well and I‚Äôm not sure what your financial situation is, but don‚Äôt you want to ensure your current child and future children have a stable, well taken care for life? How do you know this guy won‚Äôt leave you in a year and you‚Äôre a single mom of two kids. While this is not exactly a place to give you marital advice I also understand what it‚Äôs like to be 23 and think you want something and deeply regret it when you are wiser and more mature.

I've learned that people who don't know what's inappropriate--family, friends, co-workers--need to be given some guidelines.

It's just shitty that one has to spend any time/emotional energy in figuring out how to deal with shit like this, when we should just be focusing on grieving and healing.

If you're obsessing on CD4 about when to test and constantly consulting your apps....it's seems like you're already doing the thing your worried about happening if you track.  

For me, tracking one or two things let me *not* think about it so much.  Sure, I had to record my temp in the morning, and remember to do OPKs one week.  But I didn't have to strategize about *when* I might O, because my strips would tell me.  And testing wasn't ambiguous, because I knew when I O'd.

Of course, if you're not going to track, you could have sex every other day, starting conservatively early and ending conservatively late to account for unreliable cycles....

I would say, if you don't get pregnant this cycle, or for a few cycles, how will you feel?  Do you think you'll be able to say, ""we just have to keep at it""?

I bought our nursery furniture this week, it should arrive soon. It's my first real baby purchase and a bit scary. I think it will help though to get things set up, as right now it's still so hard to visualize having a baby. 

I got some bad news from work, which is that I have a crazy important presentation scheduled the day before my induction.

<p>In some of my pregnancies, I&#39;ve called the doctor right away. In others, I&#39;ve waited. For my current pregnancy, I contacted my doctor the same morning as the positive test, but I also have medications to manage. If you don&#39;t, I think it&#39;s mostly a matter of comfort.

It seems like the hardest thing to parse is time after loss, since that's when the 1 month = 1 cycle rule of thumb really fails.  

I think beyond that, the ""months of trying"" basically account for the fact that most women will have, e.g. 5-6 cycles in 6 months.  

To some extent, the clock does start over with each pregnancy.  (If it didn't, I'd already be having referrals to a fertility specialist.)  The 5 months (cycles?) you were trying the first time can't help your doctor determine if the surgery to fix your post-loss Asherman's was successful.  Only trying and seeing what happens will do that.  (And since it took you 5 months the first time, it stands to reason it might take around the same amount of time this time.)

That being said, it's also true that all ""trying"" is not the same.  Sometimes we can get our timing perfectly.  Sometimes life gets in the way, and maybe we can just get in one shot on what turns out to be O-3 or O-4.  So that adds a bit of uncertainty for everyone: did that latter cycle not work out because there's a problem?  Or because our timing was sub-optimal?

Something like IUI would take out some of that uncertainty.  Since you have your Asherman's concern, it might make sense for you to try something like that earlier than some people might consider it.  

We've reached the mark where we've been TTC-ing longer post-loss than we did the first time.  It's not easy to feel like beyond trying to get our timing right, not much is in my control...that all I can do is be patient, and wait for something to work out...or not work out. I wish there was something that could just guarantee us all a BFP on the first try!

We ran a huge panel for autoimmune and everything came back negative so as far as she's concerned I don't have an autoimmune issue but they're not certain whats going on. My mom has hypothyroidism and is prediabetic, but my TSH levels have been normal (they were tested not long ago). That being said, they've never looked at any other thyroid function tests, *just* TSH. 

I sent my doctor a big list of everything I'd like tested and hopefully she can get those requisitions to me soon so I don't have to take too many cycles off TTC as I'd really like to get back on the horse. (My husband wants to take a cycle or two off). He had an SA in 2016 when we were TTC #1 so I know there are no sperm issues.

My doctor originally told me she didn&#39;t want to do testing unless I had 3 consecutive losses but after the 2nd I decided if the issue was an easy fix then I&#39;d rather know now then wait. If it&#39;s unexplained I will definitely take things as they come. I&#39;m still hopeful that they were just bad luck and the third times the charm. </p>

I ovulate pretty regularly anyway, it appears, and I confirm with CM, OPKs, CP, and how I feel (that progesterone surge has pretty unmistakable symptoms for me). Also, temping just fed the obsession and anxiety around TTC. 

Also, I've gotten pregnant 4 times. Here's what I've learned: sex in the FW is good enough.  Once is good enough.  O-2 and O-3 is good enough. If the sperm are decent timing isn't THAT relevant. I think we are learning that we don't get pregnant every month not because sperm and egg aren't meeting, for the most part, but because it's normal for most eggs to not be genetically normal. Based on our experience with timing, we now try to hit a couple of days in the lead up to O and not worry too much. 

I don't have a lot of other techniques for being less obsessive (other than being benched lol).  But hobbies and friends are really good.  I'm taking pottery and I'm obsessed and it's at least one night a week where I'm thinking about something else.  I'm also really focused on my fitness right now, which takes my mind off things, and also improves my mood.

It allows a place for our users to discuss their current pregnancy after loss. But we do have strict rules regarding mentioning those current pregnancies outside of the Alumni or Results thread so as to shield those who are newly grieving or deep ""in the trenches"" (as I call it). There should definitely NOT be any BFPs in a daily discussion thread.

You can test progesterone in a non-pregnant cycle. It should be done 7 days after ovulation. If you aren't tracking ovulation, the typical recommendation is CD 21, but that assumes that you're ovulating on day 14 and most women have some variation in when they ovulate. While you're testing for progesterone, you might as well test for estrogen too. 

As /u/therealamberrose said, the link between progesterone and loss is debated. We know that some women have low progesterone post-ovulation that causes implantation issues - this is called luteal phase defect - and we know that later in pregnancy, some women seem to lose healthy babies when they have low progesterone. These women benefit from supplementation. We know that pregnancies where the baby has chromosomal issues or growth problems often have low progesterone, but in this case the low progesterone is a side effect of another issue, so supplementing progesterone doesn't help. Doctors disagree on what percent of women fall into each category. My doctor thinks it's a very low risk intervention, so I've been on it for all but my first pregnancy. Obviously it hasn't stopped our losses, but my doctor thinks it can only help.

I also agree with therealamberrose's suggestion of thyroid testing. Thyroid problems are really common and can cause difficulty conceiving and miscarriages. If you have a thyroid problem, you will probably feel a lot better once it is treated as well, so that seems like a no brainer.

Testing blood sugar/insulin response is another common one. It also makes it more difficult to conceive and increases the risk of miscarriage.

Depending on your family history, some doctors might be willing to run tests for autoimmune diseases or blood clotting.

There's other blood work that you could do, like karyotyping for you and your husband, but it's probably not worth the expense after two early losses, especially when it's so unlikely to be the issue. I think one of the frustrating things about losses before 5 weeks is that we don't have a lot of data on how many very early losses tips the balance from ""probably bad luck"" to ""there is a good chance there's a problem."" It's possible this is still bad luck, though I know that's not a very satisfying explanation considering how painful it is to lose a baby :( Even after many more losses and all the testing, about 50% of couples never get answers, though the majority of these couples do go on to have surviving children.

And for the timing on this one in particular (just read your other thread...what a tough trip! I am so sorry!)

The role of progesterone issues in pregnancy and loss is still highly debated. It is mostly believed that low progesterone during pregnancy is a symptom of the loss not a cause. So going on progesterone after you have already conceived is still ""controversial"" in that we aren't sure it helps. But they (doctors) seem to think it doesn't hurt, either. 

Going on progesterone after you ovulate is another story...although with some similarly controversial thoughts/no clear findings. BUT this is usually the route that many REs will take. THIS route is often prescribed if you have low CD21 results multiple cycles. Low CD21 results could mean that your ovulation is ""weak""(again, many doctors disagree about this)...going on progesterone at 3dpo COULD help with that. Or taking some form of fertility medicine could also. Or a combination of fertility meds and progesterone. Again - this is studied but does not have incredibly clear findings (which is true about so many things related to fertility and it really sucks).

I've had a slew of testing done and can share all of it with you if you wish. But my biggest suggestion includes:

* CD3 testing
* Near surge testing, to compare to CD3 results
* Thyroid testing...and ALL of them, not just TSH and T3 (so ask for T3, T3RU, T4, and TSH)
* CD21 testing on *multiple* cycles

Thyroid issues are one of the most common issues related to loss and a great place to start when looking into a reason.

Unfortunately, a large percentage of repeat loss never has a reason attached. Thankfully, for those who don't find a reason, there is also a huge percentage who go on to have live births (80%!). Of course, the pain, time, and continual loss is hard while you wait and continue to try for that.

I'm having this recurring nightmare that we find out at our NT screening there's no heartbeat or growth and for some reason I spontaneously miscarry as soon as we leave the office.

Every time I wake up from one, I have to stay awake for a while or I go right back to the same dream or start it over.

Doppler is supposed to arrive in the mail today sometime (thanks Amber) but I'm too scared to use it tonight just in case I can't find the heartbeat - with the nightmares, I'd rather not ratchet my anxiety up even more right now. If tomorrow's scan goes well, I'll start trying to use it tomorrow night to see if I can get the knack of it. At least if I don't find it then, I'll be reassured it's my incompetence and not that it's missing!

That being said, it's not just about straight addition of cycles or calendar dates.  The particulars matter.  The calendar does start over somewhat after a loss.  

Only about 1 in 5 women get pregnant in the first *three* cycles after a miscarriage.  So if you've just tried one cycle since your MMC, I think most doctors would consider it too early to refer someone for fertility issues.

So I don't think the ""full year"" would apply.  When there's good reason to think there's a fertility issue, it's better to check it out early.  Not one cycle of TTC early....but no later than 6 months.  

I've also heard it suggested that if you know that your timing is good each cycle (via CM, OPKs, BBT), and you're not getting pregnant, that some doctors will take that into consideration and suggest fertility interventions earlier (again at 6 months) regardless of age.

I posted when it happened to me, and I got responses from others saying, ""I went through this too.""  I think there should be a name for it.

For me, part of it was transitioning from ""sprint"" to ""marathon.""  During the first couple months of intense grief, I was kind of in survival mode.  But at some point, you have to pick up with the rest of your life again, and you realize this is going to be a long haul....  

I also think that desire to just be pregnant again is initially intense, and gradually lessens, too.   We were far enough along that we really started needing to turn our lists into concrete plans: FSA deposits, childbirth classes, parental leave, childcare arrangements.  I was really in a ""about to become a parent"" mindset.  And it's taken months for my brain to let go of that.

I posted when it happened to me, and I got responses from others saying, &quot;I went through this too.&quot;  I think there should be a name for it.</p>

<p>For me, part of it was transitioning from &quot;sprint&quot; to &quot;marathon.&quot;  During the first couple months of intense grief, I was kind of in survival mode.  But at some point, you have to pick up with the rest of your life again, and you realize this is going to be a long haul....  </p>

<p>I also think that desire to just be pregnant again is initially intense, and gradually lessens, too.   We were far enough along that we really started needing to turn our lists into concrete plans: FSA deposits, childbirth classes, parental leave, childcare arrangements.  I was really in a &quot;about to become a parent&quot; mindset.  And it&#39;s taken months for my brain to let go of that.  </p>

So, I got to ask them all what they thought. Here are the opinions of my 3 MFM doctors as well as my OBGYN:

1) **MFM #1: ""Wait until after one normal cycle.""** By this, he meant that I should wait two periods. The first period marking the beginning of my first cycle, and the second period marking the end of my first cycle. His rationale is that during a D&C/D&E, there's some degree of scraping of the uterine lining, and so it probably isn't building up evenly immediately afterwards (patchy areas of lining, some thick and some thin). So he felt like the first period was a throwaway, then the lining starts trying to build up normally (but might not), but after your second period, it should be more normal again.

2) **MFM #2: ""Wait six months.""** ??? This was shocking to me as it was not at all related to anything I had read. I asked for her rationale, and it sounded like the reason she was giving had to do with diminishing risks of cervical incompetency? Anyway, I wasn't the only one who thought this was a little weird (see below)...

3) **MFM #3: ""You can start trying right away.""** He explained that doctors used to tell patients to wait a few months but that new data (pretty sure he was referring to [this paper](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs10995-018-2480-7) or [this paper](https://journals.lww.com/greenjournal/Abstract/2017/12000/Interpregnancy_Interval_After_Pregnancy_Loss_and.18.aspx)) are increasingly showing that this isn't necessary. Instead, he emphasized that we should just use our own emotional readiness to guide when we were ready to try again. I mentioned MFM #2's 6 month thing to him (above), and he seemed really taken aback by this (""Yeah, that's not data driven""). And then when he stepped out of my little pre-op area, I saw that he was animatedly instructing the resident that that kind of advice made no sense. 

4) **OBGYN: ""You can start trying right away.""** She gave the same reasons as MFM #3.

So, my take home here is that there aren't any good data to suggest you have to wait, although it's pretty easy to come up with hypothetical reasons for why you should have to (patchy lining, cervix needs 6 months to recover for some reason, etc). My husband and I started trying after I had gotten one period because we weren't ready to try again so soon (and also because my post-op instructions were to wait 2-3 weeks before putting anything in my vagina...). But we started trying during that month after my first period. 

**In the end, it's a deeply personal decision. But you should feel comfortable knowing that there's no known *medical* reason to wait.**

Best of luck to you, and I am so terribly sorry for your loss.

We know.  That's why we're all here.  I'm very sorry for your loss.

Personally, I need to take the process one step at a time.  For us, we'll need additional testing and scanning in future pregnancies, which feels like even more opportunities to get bad news.  I can't take it all on at once.  So I've broken it into pieces.  The only thing I think about right now is TTC.  After that, I'll worry about making it to the first ultrasound.  After that, the NIPT, etc.  

Another thing some women suggest is not testing early.  The thinking is that because CP's are so common, and having one doesn't mean you won't go on to have healthy pregnancies, maybe it's just better for one's mental health not to know.  

On the one hand, I generally fall on the side of ""knowledge is power.""  And if someone's having repeated CP's such that they can't stay pregnant, obviously that would be good to know.  

On the other hand, the first time we were TTC, I never tested before my period was due.  Overall, it made TTC a lot more relaxed because I wasn't constantly thinking about it/getting negatives.  

The first cycle we were TTC, my period was a week late.  I didn't think to test because (a) I thought our timing was a little off, (b) I didn't expect it to happen the first try and (c) I was preoccupied with work stress.  I just assumed my late period was due to stress.  A CP didn't even occur to me.  In hindsight, it might have been a CP, but if it was, I've certainly benefited anxiety-wise from not knowing.  

Now that we're TTC again, I have been tracking more, and testing earlier.  And it's a more stressful and disappointing experience.  This month, I'm leaning toward avoiding testing again.  I don't even know what DPO I am.

It was pretty quick in my case‚Äî I called the RE the day I got my period after that visit with my midwife. He happened to have an opening that week, the lab did the cycle day 3 bloodwork on CD3, and that was all normal. I had my first appointment with the doc a few days later where he confirmed the bloodwork was normal, looked at my charts and took down my history, and determined that the problem was likely due to a progesterone deficiency, given that all other bloodwork was normal. Out of an abundance of caution, he scheduled a few imaging tests for me‚Äî a saline sono and an HSG, because it was previously known that I have a uterine anomaly that makes it heart-shaped rather than pear shaped. (Other than increased likelihood of breech presentation, this shouldn‚Äôt generally pose much problem.) He wanted to verify the shape again to make sure it was a minor anomaly rather than a septum, which would have required some surgical correction, and he wanted to make sure my postpartum D&C (for retained placental tissue) hadn‚Äôt caused any scarring. He told me he was mostly doing these because he felt that he‚Äôd rather make sure everything was in ready-to-conceive shape then, rather than me experiencing another loss in the future because there was something we overlooked when we were still in investigation mode. I had already carried two pregnancies to term and had two chemical pregnancies, so he was fairly confident that he wasn‚Äôt going to find any long-standing issues with me, and I had gotten pregnant quickly all four times so he was fairly certain my tubes were clear and that once we could balance my hormones we would be in good shape to conceive again. He did tell me to begin taking a baby aspirin daily, because the most likely cause for my stillbirth was determined to be vascular constriction in the umbilical cord, and sometimes clotting factors can contribute to negative pregnancy outcomes. All my bloodwork for clotting disorders appeared to be totally normal too, so I haven‚Äôt been placed on more intense blood thinners, but my midwife and MFM agree that I should just remain on a daily baby aspirin for the duration of pregnancy in the future‚Äî it‚Äôs a rather harmless little attempt at keeping bloodflow moving. 

All of the imaging tests were normal, my uterine anomaly was confirmed to be minor, and so he agreed that following ovulation, we could supplement with progesterone that cycle. He opted to do a trigger shot to trigger ovulation that cycle‚Äî even though we had confirmed I was ovulating regularly, this just gave us a little bit more control over the process; we knew exactly when I would ovulate so we knew exactly when to start supplementing with progesterone to avoid any guesswork. I became pregnant that cycle and remained on the progesterone supplements for the first trimester. (They were vaginal.) I‚Äôm now 33 weeks along.

Small disclaimer: my husband happens to be in the military, so we were feeling particular pressure to achieve a live birth in the relatively brief window in which my husband is available to both impregnate me and be around for the birth/baby‚Äôs first months. My RE happens to be a former military OB/GYN himself, so he was particularly sensitive to our sense of time constraint, and I suspect this made him willing to topload my testing and treatment rather than isolating one variable at a time.

Yesterday was our birthing class. Before we left the house, my husband expressed anxiety at having to be around people (he‚Äôs incredibly shy), and I told him I was anxious about having to be in a room with other pregnant women when my experience has been that of loss and complications.

Well, we had to go first in introductions, and there was a part where you said what you were excited about and what you were nervous about. I said, ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre excited to have a baby,‚Äù and the other participants laughed, so I continued. ‚ÄúWell, I mean, we‚Äôve had 4 miscarriages, and this pregnancy has been very difficult and complicated, so we‚Äôre just excited to maybe have a baby come home.

I‚Äôm very rarely uncomfortable in a group and will eventually end up the center of attention just by virtue of being talkative and assertive. This was way out of character for me.)

I gathered myself a little and went on to say that we‚Äôre nervous for my health and wellbeing between labor and my plans for a hysterectomy, and that it‚Äôs difficult to feel at ease and confident about things going well, even with the baby being fine.

Another couple said they‚Äôd been through 3 rounds of IVF to get pregnant, and they were just grateful to even *be* pregnant. That made me feel better about having overshared and been visibly nervous in front of the group.

The class itself was great. We felt a lot better having taken it, even though I‚Äôve already switched to the big hospital with the NICU just in case. There was even a part on the tour where we got to meet a baby, and that made me feel so hopeful and excited.

<p>Feeling you right now. Since we lost our daughter in February, my brother has been hassling us to go over and play board games. I guess he thinks this will make us feel better? (We&#39;re not really board games people...I mean, they&#39;re fine, but we just haven&#39;t really wanted to sit and learn how to play a complicated, 3-hour board game.)

I just responded, ‚Äúfine‚Äù which is my reflexive response now to people I don‚Äôt care to know how I‚Äôm actually feeling‚Äî think like, the bank teller or the neighbor we don‚Äôt actually talk to. She probed a little more like, ‚Äúhow are you REALLY feeling?‚Äù Which confused me a bit because like, we don‚Äôt talk about stuff. Ever. In fact, we rarely even talk; we never communicate by phone and rarely visit one another so this just seemed a touch intrusive, because I don‚Äôt go from zero to 60 when communicating my feelings.

It's awful being stuck in miscarriage limbo, and that really is the only way to describe it.

I lost my baby in January at around 12 weeks (first pregnancy) and am still TTC. We paid for a private scan at 10 weeks because we simply couldn't wait for our hospital scan and they told me that I must have gotten my dates wrong because baby was only measuring 6 weeks, but there was a heartbeat. I knew from that moment there was something wrong, but my partner was optimistic and said I must have gotten my dates wrong like the sonographer said. I think it was the upcoming weekend that all my pregnancy symptoms disappeared, but I kept quiet and hopeful for the next scan. 

2 weeks later at my hospital scan baby hadn't grown at all and had lost their heartbeat. They told me to come back in a week to confirm but to expect the worst. They didn't offer me much advice at the hospital, just a leaflet explaining my options and the risks involved. I spent the next few days obsessively googling my whole situation. But unfortunately the miscarriage started 4 days later. 

I couldn't take the first 2 days off work because my pregnancy was a secret and since it was over I didn't feel like I could bring it up. I didn't want my boss to know we were TTC. By the 3rd day I had to have the next 3 days off because it was quite bad. The hospital told me to expect a ""heavy period"" and that was it. It was not like any period I've ever had, but everyone is different. At my follow up scan they said the miscarriage was incomplete and again offered me medication, d&c, or waiting again. I opted to wait because it was only 1 piece left and I was afraid of surgery, I didn't want the medication either because I didn't want to go through heavy bleeding again. They didn't offer me Any follow up appointments, just told me to do a pregnancy test in a week and if it was negative then that would mean the miscarriage was complete. If it was positive then I would need surgery due to the risk of infection. 2 days later the final piece came away and I got a negative result the following week. 

To get me through I spoke to friends who had been in my situation and it made me feel better to know I wasn't alone in my suffering. It took 6 weeks for me to get my next period (in March). It's been 6 weeks now since my last period, I've had cramps and backache but my period hasn't happened yet. All my pregnancy tests are negative so I think my cycles will be irregular for a while.

A lot of people I know had announced this pregnancy since I lost my baby and I'm trying desperately not to be bitter, which is extremely hard. A lady on my department at work has recently announced her pregnancy which has been horrible for me, but I'm remaining positive and happy for her. After all, we all struggle and I don't know what her history is. She could have been through hard time as well.

I hope you get through this with the support from your partner, it's very easy to snap and turn on each other at a time like this (my partner and I have had many arguments since the miscarriage), but stick together and stay hopeful for the future. Pregnancy isn't as easy as lots of people make it out to be and unfortunately a lot of men and women suffer.

I was induced with oral misoprostol. That induced contractions that were almost as painful as my worst cramps at first.  When I was dilated enough, my OB broke my water, and the delivery was relatively soon after.  Normally it's about 12-16 hours from start of induction to delivery.  

For pain management, I started off with the hospital strength aspirin.  Then I was given fentanyl when I started to have more painful back labor.  And finally an epidural towards the end.  My doctors suggested asking for pain management before you think you need it, and this was good advice.  Don't be shy.  

The hormones interfere with your thermal regulation.  A button-up sweater/zip-up hoodie and warm pajama pants that you can layer with your hospital gown are good--especially for making trips to the bathroom.

Women also tend to lose their appetite as they get closer to labor.  If you have an epidural, you'll only be allowed clear beverages.  But we brought snacks that are easy to eat one-handed: almonds, baby carrots, granola bars, bananas, etc. and I appreciated having them post-labor.  (Hospital food is slow, and meh.)

I ended up staying over a night in the hospital, due timing of my delivery, post-partum care, and the need for my epidural to wear off.  But some people get sent home the same day.  And you'll be given detailed post-partum care instructions.

One of my nurses warned me about lactation.  I put a sports bra on as soon as I could, and lived in them for about 5 days.  I didn't get a prescription for lactation, but my care instructions recommended peppermint or sage tea.  So my husband brewed a batch for me every day (with some ginger and honey), and I drank a few cups each day.  

The hospital might ask you about arrangements for your baby's remains.  We picked a funeral home with information on their website about funeral/cremation for infants, stillborn babies, and miscarried babies.  We appreciated (a) that they had experience with situations like ours, and (b) that we could get most of our questions answers without talking to anyone.  We gave the paperwork to a social worker at the hospital, and she did most of the communication with the funeral home.  We just had to go to sign the papers.  We had our baby cremated, and were allowed to have a few items (a blanket, a picture, etc.) cremated with him.

When my son was born, we spent hours with him, held him, took pictures with him, etc.  At first, I wasn't sure I'd want to.  But now, those hours are so precious to me.  And the nurses made footprints for us, and also sent us home with his little hat.  All of these momentos are also precious to us now.   

What you can do for memory making will depend on how you feel, your doctor's guidance about the condition of the baby, and what the hospital offers for babies of size 13 weeks (some can do footprints, others not).  We also picked out names for the baby (we learned it was a boy when he was born), and asked for his weight and length.  

We ended up making a mini-baby book with his ultrasound pictures, birth pictures, footprints, etc.  In the weeks after our son's death, it helped to feel like we were ""doing something"" for him, and I think our families also appreciated being able to look at the book.  It's also reassuring to have this book that says, ""Our son was here.""  

Our son was also our first, and I'm also over 35, so I get how you feel.  There's intense grief that makes you want to wait to TTC, a strong desire to be pregnant again, and a feeling that due to age, that waiting comes with it's own risk.  

We were cleared to TTC after 6 weeks.  We waited 2 months to start, but it wasn't until 3 months that my cycles were back to normal.

The majority of couples do get pregnant again after a miscarriage, but it takes time.  One third are pregnant within 5 cycles of TTC again.  I'm five months out, and I still have bad days, but it *has* gotten easier.  Bereavement counseling, books about pregnancy loss, and communities like one this have help.

""I feel content this morning, but I also feel like I don't deserve to feel happy. I'm thankful that we hired someone to clean the dog poop in the yard.""
""I feel cautiously happy-- like if the wrong memory pops into my head, I'll fall headlong into a black hole of depression again. I'm thankful for dark chocolate truffles.""


I have a lot of other advice, too, gathered up during the course of three losses and years of fertility treatments.

It's good to name the baby. It's good to have a memento of the baby-- a necklace, a toy, a garden gnome, or a tattoo. We haven't done these things for any of our losses, and I find that as time goes on, the fact that we didn't name them and we don't have a memento of them... it hurts. I think of them as three little peas in a pod. I've thought about getting a pea-pod necklace or growing actual peas every year. Pea-green is becoming my favorite color, and anything with peas on it catches my eye. All of my worksheets at work have pea-green highlights. My pens are green. My toe nail polish is green. 

I'm 37, too. My OB says I'm still young for IVF. It doesn't feel that way, though. She says I've got 4-5 good years for IVF, and then another 3-4 okay years for IVF. So don't think you can't try again. Age is one of the obstacles they can work around to help us get pregnant, and that's kind of the thing to remember-- they can help us work around damn near any obstacle. 

Try not to fixate on dates-- they can turn into tsunamis of grief. Try to let them float out of your mind. I'm an auditor and good with numbers, and I try so hard not to think about the dates. The due dates. The dates I found out they were lost. The dates we conceived. Do your absolute best not to mark them in any way and not to remember them. They just open up wounds all over again. 

You have to do what feels right for you. If you're the sort of person to hold out hope for miracles, do it. If you're not, then don't. And if someone is spouting platitudes at you, and it isn't helpful, tell them, ""Thank you for the thought, but that just isn't helpful right now."" And if someone is spouting platitudes at you, and you feel flooded with hope and gratitude, smile and tell them thank you for helping float your mood along. 

Consider going on a trip. We went to Disneyland and took my best friend with us. It was great! No kids, no responsibilities. We did all the fun grown-up rides, wore the soles off our shoes, and sprang for the photo pass and had the photographers take our photos about 1,000 times. My husband visited Star Wars land about 15 times in 2 days. You'd think that with all the kids there, I'd be really fucking miserable, but so many kids were being little shits and crying and whining that I didn't even mind. There were a few cute babies that made eyes at me, but mostly I was distracted trying to find Hidden Mickeys everywhere. We did Pirates like 10 times to find the Hidden Mickeys there. Plus, planning a short, easy trip can be a good distraction in the coming weeks-- something to look forward to-- without a bunch of family or responsibilities.

Crafts. After our loss in 2017, I made 5 quilts in one summer. I've only ever made 6 quilts in my life. It sounds dumb, but crafting really helped me keep my sanity. I'm not a crafty person. I'm not even creative. I am an auditor-- and I take the skills of an auditor to the extreme in my personal life. I don't get jokes because I'm too literal. I'm always telling people to ""do the math"" when I give them advice, and I mean it literally. I don't do hugs, and I'm not a cuddler. I'm an auditor, but I made some damn fine quilts in the summer of 2017. I didn't use patterns-- I just made it up as I went along. I got really crafty through the worst of my depression, and I feel like it saved my life. 

Therapy. Find a therapist-- visit therapist after therapist until you find one that you like. Therapists are not just for crazy people. Therapists are trained to help people navigate complicated emotions so that they make decisions consistent with their values. You're a pendulum that has been set in motion, and your feelings will be all over the place. A good therapist can help you find your center faster, and they can help you navigate your grief so that when you try again, you do so from a place where you have the strength and resilience to incubate new life-- because that process is very hard, and if you are too raw from your grief, it will exact a heavy price in terms of your emotional and physical health-- right when we need both of things for making a new baby.

I'm very sorry for your loss. In the coming weeks, I hope you find strength you didn't know you had and remarkable resilience.

&quot;I feel like the sun will never shine on my face again, but I&#39;m thankful for the rain today.&quot;
&quot;I feel content this morning, but I also feel like I don&#39;t deserve to feel happy. I&#39;m thankful that we hired someone to clean the dog poop in the yard.&quot;
&quot;I feel cautiously happy-- like if the wrong memory pops into my head, I&#39;ll fall headlong into a black hole of depression again. I&#39;m thankful for dark chocolate truffles.&quot;</p>

Expect a lot of boredom. I arrived at the hospital at 8am, and got my first dose of cerdivil at 9am. If you go this route, you're stuck in bed for the first hour after application. It SUCKS to get those pills up to your cervix, even though they are the size of Tylenol. Really, this is the most physically painful part. I did 4 doses of cerdivil. They may add pitocin at some point, which many women claim makes the process more painful (I've never thought so, so yrmv).

You will be bored, until you aren't. Inductions if this type tend to be waiting, then everything happens at once.

When my son was actually delivered, I was asleep with an epidural, so it wasn't physically painful at all. He just kind of came. 

You don't have to hold your baby. I didn't hold my son (it was suggested he would be in poor condition, and I didn't want to see him like that). It's ok. If you want to, then do. I recommend getting all the memories the staff offer-- footprints, handprints, locks of hair, a blanket your baby was wrapped in, photos. At 16w of growth, my son was too small for the prints, so don't expect them. You can put it away and never look at it again, but you only have one chance to do it.
Addirionally, call your OB and ask for copies of any scans you've gotten. 

I was up within a few hours. My body felt normal because they're so small at this point. You'll likely have bleeding akin to a period. My cycle returned a month later, but as is normal with loss, it was different from before (I gained 4 days, but some women experience shorter cycles).

Your milk may come in. You can ask for a prescription to dry up your supply, or wear a tight bra, use cold compresses, and avoid warm water on your breasts for a week or two. My milk came in, but having experienced low supply with my LC, I decided to pump and donate.

I'm currently sitting here with my 11-day old rainbow baby. My son's birth day is next weekend; he'd be 1. A live birth is still possible. We were so unlucky...

I kind of get your anger about your baby being taken by something rare.  I'm over 35, so I never took for granted anything would go well.  I was so relieved when we didn't have a first tri-miscarriage.  When the NIPT (and quad test) for trisomies came back normal.  When the NT scan ruled out neural tube defects.  When the anatomy scan was healthy.  

And then...due to an accident...our baby was diagnosed with a very rare genetic syndrome.  The less severe form affects 1 in 100,000-300,000.  My son had a more severe form--only 8 cases have ever been reported....in the world.  

And I think...why?....why did my baby make it through all those milestones, only to end up having this incredibly rare thing?

<p>I kind of get your anger about your baby being taken by something rare.  I&#39;m over 35, so I never took for granted anything would go well.  I was so relieved when we didn&#39;t have a first tri-miscarriage.  When the NIPT (and quad test) for trisomies came back normal.  When the NT scan ruled out neural tube defects.  When the anatomy scan was healthy.  </p>

<p>And then...due to an accident...our baby was diagnosed with a very rare genetic syndrome.  The less severe form affects 1 in 100,000-300,000.  My son had a more severe form--only 8 cases have ever been reported....in the world.  </p>

<p>And I think...why?....why did my baby make it through all those milestones, only to end up having this incredibly rare thing?  I think there&#39;s a part of my mind which will always think, &quot;Does not compute.&quot;</p>

The other one I'm not as close to so I asked said good friend to tell her about what happened, which she did. 
So we met up this week and they didn't say anything - not How are you feeling, I'm sorry for your loss - nothing. They just talked about their lives and I asked them questions etc., like any other normal meetup except I felt like this was the elephant in the room.

 Now in hindsight I maybe didn't really give them a chance. I was a bit stressed and talked a lot and steered the conversation to topics about their own stuff.  But I just feel so awkward now and sad that they didn't acknowledge the loss that has taken over my life the last few weeks. They're asking to meet up again and I just don't feel like it anymore. 

I'm not exactly sure how to open up the conversation, it's not like anyone wants to hear ""Hey by the way can we talk about the fact that my baby died?""

One of them is a very good friend of mine, I&#39;ve messaged her a bit after the loss and told her more about what happened but haven&#39;t met her in person since except very briefly at her child&#39;s birthday party. The other one I&#39;m not as close to so I asked said good friend to tell her about what happened, which she did. 
So we met up this week and they didn&#39;t say anything - not How are you feeling, I&#39;m sorry for your loss - nothing. They just talked about their lives and I asked them questions etc., like any other normal meetup except I felt like this was the elephant in the room.</p>

<p>Now in hindsight I maybe didn&#39;t really give them a chance. I was a bit stressed and talked a lot and steered the conversation to topics about their own stuff.  But I just feel so awkward now and sad that they didn&#39;t acknowledge the loss that has taken over my life the last few weeks. They&#39;re asking to meet up again and I just don&#39;t feel like it anymore. </p>

<p>I&#39;m not exactly sure how to open up the conversation, it&#39;s not like anyone wants to hear &quot;Hey by the way can we talk about the fact that my baby died?&quot; I don&#39;t want to avoid them forever but I also don&#39;t want to pretend that I&#39;m fine. Any ideas? </p>

Everyone gets a rainbow baby right? Everything went well until 16weeks when it was discovered the baby was measuring a week behind. I also had blood work come back funky (it came back funky in my previous pregnancy).  I was monitored closely and even had an amnio performed which came back ‚Äúnormal‚Äù. The baby only grew 10 days in 30 days. The growth was very slow and the last time we saw him alive he had hardly any fluid left. I was told he would die just like the first. It was only a few days after the ultrasound that I couldn‚Äôt find a heartbeat anymore. My doctors are certain it‚Äôs a complex genetic thing going on. We are starting this new testing called Xome hoping for answers of some sort. 

Anyway, I wanted to tell you we are done. I don‚Äôt want to be but we have to be. Having 2 losses has completely changed me (not for the better). My husband says he is 100% ok with never trying again. I wanted a third more than anything but I know the right thing to do is move on from all this and count my blessings which are my living boys.

It helps you realize and understand that sometimes the best thing to do is to move on without getting what you set out for because sometimes chasing your dream can really do damage to yourself physically and mentally. Highly recommend the book.

I have PCOS and I don&#39;t ovulate but every 7 months typically so it&#39;s good to know if it actually happened or not. Also, if your temps stay high it&#39;s like having a super early pregnancy test. I did opks to confirm ovulation when I thought it was the correct cervical mucous at first.</p>

<p>Having sex every other day should do the trick too haha. Whichever method, expect it to take at least a few months, that way if it happens the first one it&#39;s super exciting but if it doesn&#39;t you aren&#39;t disappointed. </p>

<p>Best of luck!!</p>

<p>I also find it particularly distasteful that many people I encounter who are anti-choice exert more care over &quot;aborted babies&quot; than miscarried ones. Like, spend some time investing in research into why loss is happening if you care so much since those babies were wanted.</p>

I think ""wait and see"" is going to be the only answer, though it is frustrating. You mentioned that you were underweight in your teens and that can definitely prevent ovulation. If that was the only issue, you may have fixed it by reaching a healthier weight for your body. Many women do notice that the first cycles after miscarriage are strange, so it would just be a matter of waiting for them to get back to normal. 

It's also possible that there's something else going on that hasn't been addressed. Insulin insensitivity and thyroid problems are two of the most common causes of cycle irregularity, but hormonal contraception does nothing to treat them and can make them worse, all while covering up one of the more obvious symptoms. There are other issues that can cause cycle irregularity as well. Unfortunately, some of these issues also increase the risk of loss if they aren't treated. I think your best bet would be to talk with a good doctor if your cycles stay irregular in the coming months.

My husband and I have found tracking my cycles very helpful for understanding what's happening after loss. We've used two methods of natural family planning to track - the sympto-thermal method, which we learned from the Couple to Couple League before we married, and Creighton. We prefer the sympto-thermal method for our personal use, but Creighton has an excellent network of doctors who are trained to use charts as a diagnostic tool (they call it NaPro if you want to Google). Anyway, both methods use cervical mucus observation to track the body's ovulation attempts and the sympto-thermal method uses temperature to confirm ovulation has occurred.

Ovulation predictor tests are kinda similar to cervical mucus. Both show that ovulation is likely, but sometimes the body will gear up for ovulation, you'll get positive results, and then at the last minute the body backs down without ovulating. The body will then try to ovulate later in the cycle. This is especially likely to happen right after loss or when you have a history of irregular cycles. Temperature only rises after an egg has been released, so it can be a good way to distinguish between successful and unsuccessful attempts. Some women also use progesterone testing strips (they're very new and still fairly expensive) or have their doctors order progesterone blood tests (requires a cooperative doctor and is even more expensive). Personally, I think temperatures are easier :)

I was like you and started birth control not that long after I started getting my period (period at 16, BCP at 18), and took it up until about 6 months before we started trying to get pregnant, which was about 14 years total. I found that my cycles started longer (35+ days) and over the course of 6 months slowly came down to nice even 28 day cycles with ovulation on CD15. However, once I started having miscarriages things sort of reset. I was tracking ovulation and noticed that after each loss I'd go back to the 35+ day cycle with later ovulation (usually the follicular phase is what varies; luteal phase tends to be the same(ish) each month), then progress back down to 28 days over the course of a couple of cycles. This was true pretty much every time.

That may or may not be the case for you, but it seems that everyone's first cycle or two post loss is a bit funky.

<p>Always happy to talk.  I am so, so sorry about your losses - to have to go through this tragedy twice is so cruel.  I&#39;m so happy you made your day all about you - it sounds like a good way to spend what can&#39;t help but be a horribly sad day. </p>

I would recommend you have a full blood clotting panel run as well as homocysteine. Homocysteine is what my hematologist was worried about, but as long as you have an optimal level(between 6 and 7.5 I think it is) and don't have any other risk factors(smoking, hormonal birth control, etc) you are at low risk for a clot. 

Incidentally, I took hormonal birth control for 17 years and was fine, all before I knew about this stuff.

The main take away from our appointments has there are relatively frequent changes to diagnostic and treatment recommendations and different doctors will recommend different things, even if they're all working at world-class hospitals and well respected in their field.

The MFMs who specialized in blood clotting told us that we likely still do not know all the genes and combinations of genes that elevate clotting risk. The majority of people with genetic thrombophilias never get any clots, even when the risks are further elevated by surgery, estrogen-containing birth control, pregnancy, etc. But a small minority of people with genetic thrombophilias seem to just get clot after clot. So, having these clotting genes is a risk factor, not a guarantee. Additionally, many of the known genetic thrombophilias have been discovered relatively recently and there are likely more genetic thrombophilias that we have yet to discover. There are also genes that are strongly suspected to elevate clotting risk, but it can take many years for those studies to translate into a commercially available blood test, let alone standardized recommendations for treatment. One thing to be aware of is that a lot of the research has been done on white women, often from north-western Europe, so if you have a different background, there is likely less information about the genetic risks common in your ethnic group.

Baby aspirin seems to be a pretty common recommendation. Every doctor we spoke with thought it was safe and worth trying, though they disagreed about how likely it was to help. We also had a couple of doctors recommend trying heparin/lovenox. There was a recent study that found no benefit to trying heparin, but there are past studies that did find some benefits, especially for women with no living children, many unexplained losses, and at least one loss in the second trimester.

From what I understand, the role of MTHFR mutations was contentious in hematology for some time. I‚Äôm finishing up my MD/PhD and recently did some reading on MTHFR C677T because a patient of mine was found to be homozygous for the mutation. My understanding is that this mutation was previously thought to be associated with an increased risk of clotting but that this is no longer the case (see JAMA paper below). A couple caveats here, though:

1) This paper only looks at leg vein clots and pulmonary embolism (when a clot travels to the lung from a vein elsewhere, usually the leg), not pregnancy outcomes.

2) I believe cardiologists still consider MTHFR mutations lead to a slightly higher risk of coronary artery disease (when stuff‚Äîfibrin and collagen and fat‚Äîbuilds up inside the arteries that feed your heart muscle, increasing the risk of a heart attack). This suggests there *might* be some organ systems that are affected by the mutation. But this not a strong association, especially for heterozygotes like you!

So, I‚Äôm not sure what your hematologist would recommend. Aspirin seems reasonable because you have a history of a loss and a mutation that at one point was thought to be associated with an increased risk of clotting. Even though this has recently been debunked with respect to leg vein clots, it‚Äôs unclear to me that it‚Äôs been systematically studied in pregnancy. I wouldn‚Äôt be surprised if another doctor took you off the aspirin, though. If I get a chance today, I‚Äôll try to poke around and see if there are any studies out there about MTHFR and pregnancy. In the meantime, I hope you like your hematologist and that he/she gives good advice!

If both your losses were in the first trimester, the statistics I've seen show a 70% chance of live birth in the next pregnancy without any sort of intervention (which is just a little lower than for couples who have never miscarried). More than 50% of couples who suffer 3+ losses never get any answers from testing, though most do eventually have surviving children even without diagnosis or treatment. There are some tests and treatments that can be done during pregnancy (like monitoring progesterone) and others that can't be done during pregnancy (saline sonohystogram, correcting uterine abnormalities, testing hormones during the menstrual cycle, etc). I don't think there's a right or wrong answer to balancing all these things - you just have to go with what you and your husband feel comfortable with.

Personally, my husband and I have always continued to try while waiting for appointments. I'm glad we have because after 2.5 years, dozens of doctors, and seven losses, we have no answers and the only advice we've gotten consistently is to try again. When we started looking for answers, we got a couple theories that were proved wrong by future losses (ie. ""it's chromosomal"" before we had any chromosomal results, first baby we get results for is totally normal). After our most recent loss, we've gotten a few more suggestions of things to try ""just in case,"" but only because of the number of losses and having a second trimester loss, not because of any test results.

If both your losses were in the first trimester, the statistics I&#39;ve seen show a 70% chance of live birth in the next pregnancy without any sort of intervention (which is just a little lower than for couples who have never miscarried). More than 50% of couples who suffer 3+ losses never get any answers from testing, though most do eventually have surviving children even without diagnosis or treatment. There are some tests and treatments that can be done during pregnancy (like monitoring progesterone) and others that can&#39;t be done during pregnancy (saline sonohystogram, correcting uterine abnormalities, testing hormones during the menstrual cycle, etc). I don&#39;t think there&#39;s a right or wrong answer to balancing all these things - you just have to go with what you and your husband feel comfortable with.</p>

<p>Personally, my husband and I have always continued to try while waiting for appointments. I&#39;m glad we have because after 2.5 years, dozens of doctors, and seven losses, we have no answers and the only advice we&#39;ve gotten consistently is to try again. When we started looking for answers, we got a couple theories that were proved wrong by future losses (ie. &quot;it&#39;s chromosomal&quot; before we had any chromosomal results, first baby we get results for is totally normal). After our most recent loss, we&#39;ve gotten a few more suggestions of things to try &quot;just in case,&quot; but only because of the number of losses and having a second trimester loss, not because of any test results. People seem to think that doctors can always find a problem and fix it, but in my experience doctors are pretty clueless about why some babies make it and others don&#39;t. </p>

So I get the dynamics (and the stuff about dressing ""warmly"", eating this, not eating that, etc.)

My first thought is that your experience reminds me of my mom's.  My mom, perhaps like you, is very family-oriented, and a pleaser.  Like you, she never quite stopped wanting approval from her mom, even at 60.  

But at the same time, around the time she finished college, she realized that she needed to protect herself.  There was a 3-4 year period where she didn't have a lot of contact with her mother (her father had passed away).  The only reason she ""reconciled"" was so that my sister and I could ""have a grandma""--but even those visits were limited.  

Overall, I think my sister and I grew up healthier because my mom put up these boundaries with her family.  It's not easy--particularly if you or your parents have strong feelings about familial obligations, there is guilt and conflict.  But she did it, and you can too, if that's what you want.  

My second thought is that as family history has come out over the years, it's become clear my strict upbringing (very similar to ""tiger parent"" upbringings) stems from a long history of issues: her troubled upbringing which stemmed from my grandfather's abusive childhood and my grandma's troubled upbringing, which stemmed from my grandma's mother's troubled life, etc.....  Sometimes adults (parents) can't act like perfect, mature adults because of the things they've been through in their own lives.  Realizing that my mom has these weaknesses that she's never going to get passed has made me it easier for me to not take certain things personally. I think to an extent, she's had a similar realization about her own mother and father.  

My mom did not provide the support I would have liked after our loss, and I had to seek it elsewhere. And this was stressful initially.  And maybe ""not fair.""  But understanding the big picture made it easier for me to do what I needed to do to take care of myself.    

My third thought is: raising a kid bilingual: I give you so much credit for the effort.  My best friend's and husband's parents pretty much only speak Chinese at home (they'll mix in some English if I'm there), and everyone went to Chinese school on Saturdays. My husband and his brother spoke only Chinese into elementary school.  But after so much schooling in English...Let's just say they're bilingual, but not as bilingual as they'd like to be.

It is heart wrenching :( I think it's common to feel like a failure - or at least I've felt that way. Grief is so hard on self-image, especially when the loss feels like a failing of our own bodies.

I don't think you should beat yourself up about falling into bad habits. It's common to struggle with bad habits while grieving. But, I also think that are real advantages to quitting smoking now, before TTC. For one thing, smoking is a risk factor for ectopic pregnancy. Women who smoke are four times more likely to have an ectopic pregnancy than those who do not. Quitting when you get a positive test is too late, since the baby has already implanted, but quitting now will reduce that risk. There are so many factors in miscarriage that are out of our hands, but this is one that you have some control over. Smoking also reduces fertility, so quitting now will make it easier to conceive when you want to.

Have you considered talking to your doctor or to a therapist? It can be hard to take good care of ourselves physically when we feel crappy emotionally. They have suggestions for making it easier to quit smoking and for improving mood in general. Is it possible that you're dealing with depression or anxiety? Both can be triggered by the hormonal changes that come with losing a baby and the grief of these enormous losses doesn't help. 

Having a good diet, regular exercise, and a healthy lifestyle does not fix everything. I think many of us here have had losses while maintaining good habits. I've never smoked, rarely drink, and have a healthy diet. I've always been a healthy weight. I've been on a number of medications that are supposed to reduce the risk of loss. I've still lost seven babies. My doctors now suspect a genetic clotting disorder caused our losses, despite my good habits. But it's not like being healthy is wasted. Smoking or being overweight would further increase my risk of clots - that's the last thing we need - and make it more difficult to treat. 

I think one of the hardest things for me to remember is that I made the best choices I could in the past, with what we knew, and now I have more information and I might make different choices. It doesn't mean that past-me was stupid or to blame for anything. It just means that life is confusing and we often make decisions with incomplete information.

Last cycle the devastating certainty that we weren't successful set in at CD 14. This cycle it set in at CD 16 so...progress? I honestly don't know if it's real or if it's self-preservation but it doesn't feel good.

This is our 3rd cycle of TTC since my MMC and our 15th cycle overall. I don't temp because my charts are unreadable and I didn't use OPKs on my last two cycle in an attempted to be ""relaxed"" about TTC. Ha. That lasted long, huh?

Of course, logic and reason tell me that my cycle varies and this is likely just a longer one. But my anxiety won't have it and has decided that the best course of action is to begin mentally berating myself any time I have a flicker of a positive thought.

I've had 3 MMC's now, and a spontaneous miscarriage as well.

My first MMC, I found out at a routine checkup and then was scheduled for D&C the next morning - this was possibly my best D&C experience. My doctor specifically wanted to spare me the waiting so I could move forward with my grief and I have appreciated the way he handled it ever since. I may not have liked his approach to RPL testing, but the way he handled the loss itself was amazing.

My second MMC, I had a doctor that sounds similar to yours. Cold, distant, didn't have time for me. Said I could either wait it out or D&C, and to call back when I'd decided. I remember her as having all the empathy of a goldfish. Once I'd decided however, the procedure was done very quickly. Again, not a lot of agonizing wait.

My third MMC I had a week long wait. My RE only does surgeries once a week on Tuesdays, and I'd found out on a Wednesday. That week was one of the longest in my life. Pure torture the entire time.

There is a third possibility between ""wait"" and ""D&C"" you may wish to talk about with your doctor - medically assisted miscarriage. Some of these ladies habe already mentioned it with various experiences. For my third MMC, I was prescribed cytotech/misoprostol to help soften my cervix to make the D&C easier - I ended up passing the pregnancy that day. It turned out that's the same drug that's used to speed up or ""trigger"" a miscarriage that's not starting on it's own. This could be a middle ground if you really would prefer to miscarry naturally/at home instead of D&C, but don't want to wait around or be caught unawares when it happens.
