Also one blocked tube only I think is actually a good sign that hydrosalpinx may not be the case or yet be the case, because I think they've come to understand it typically happens across both tubes. I think a good question to ask would be something like, ""Do we know my blocked tube isn't hydrosalpinx and if so, how?""

The first article below may be of interest especially - it was a study of women with one functioning tube and whether IUI was effective or not - it sounds like it depends on the type of blockage. So it may be worth starting to ask ""do we know more about the type of blockage I have."" 

Weirdly enough the insurance I have covered 100% of a laparoscopic surgery to assess and even repair or remove my tubes based on what they found, but was only going to cover 50% of most IUI stuff (except for the medications), so we started with the surgery, discovered I was in fact bilateral hydrosalpinx, and learned IUI was never going to have been a viable option for me.

They're great once the pregnancy exists and is growing in the uterus, but outside of that, they just haven't had to spend years thinking about how to get that pregnancy to exist.

In May I began a ""tubal infertility"" specific journey when my HSG revealed possible blockages in both tubes. So while I don't want to scare you, I also think that the doctors' response that the blocked tube shouldn't affect anything is disingenuous - it's scary to hear things may be impacting your fertility, but I'd rather hear the range of possibilities than be dismissed, which sounds like they may be doing a little. If the blocked tube is hydrosalpinx, it absolutely can impact your fertility (this was my case) - it's not just about the egg not being able to travel down the tube, but when a tube is blocked/semi-blocked it can cause ectopics and eventually actually fill with fluid that some studies have now come to understand is either toxic or disruptive for implantation (the fluid should normally flow out of the tubes but instead it ""washes"" back into the uterus and prevents implantation researchers think). 

So it may be time to visit an Reproductive Endocrinologist if you haven't already or if you feel brave, bringing in some research study based findings (I could send you links) to your current docs and find polite ways of asking if they've taken that research into account.

You can totally mourn not being on that journey with them - don't feel like that's a superficial thing, that's a real human emotion.

Also I have friends who have had hyperemesis with one pregnancy, and not a single bout of nausea with their second. It's so hard to judge. 

I also totally get the not knowing if you want to try again straight away. I find myself struggling with that almost daily. I just gave myself a set couple of months and then review how I feel. It's hard and I'm still not 100% sure.

My neighbor who just had a baby boy and is starting a day care at home business- ""You better hurry up and have babies so I can watch them!"" Sure. 

My boss when I asked for time off so I could get a blood test to confirm the miscarriage, ""Uh oh, do you have morning sickness?"" No asshole. 

Coworkers if I say I have a headache/stomachache/if something tastes weird/I'm tired/etc- ""Are you pregnant???"" Stop!!

I solved the coworker issue by snapping back anytime someone asked me if I'm pregnant and now they know not to. No one knows what happened or that I was trying but now everyone knows it's a sensitive subject. There is one awful guy in particular who asked every day until I said something like, my body isn't your business and It's rude to make comments like that. Everyone got the hint. 

I felt bad at first because I am good friends with a lot of female coworkers but they pry so much and they are all gossips. Being snippy about it stopped all the prying. 

Oh and then! This weekend my husbands grandma who thinks she is psychic said to me- are you pregnant? Someone must be due in April. And I said no a little sharply where I felt bad afterwards since she is so sweet. Later she apologized for asking such a personal question. But if I got pregnant this month I would be due in April, so I guess it's not too late for her to be psychic! 

Anyways. It just sucks people don't even realize how hurtful their words are and how damaging one sentence can be to someone else's day. This experience has definitely made me more aware of comments I make though, and I try to be as careful as possible when discussing sensitive topics.

This forum was a big help for me. Having a place where I could write frankly and freely of my upset, my thoughts (where ever they were!), and my frustrations. 

Journaling helped. 

Reading books about miscarriage, loss, grief, infertility. Those all helped. Made me feel less alone, less of an anomaly. 

I met with a Dula who is willing to work with me by helping me with my next pregnancy (whenever that is) right from the beginning.

Pushing myself to be more than the woman who has lost helped. This started small - going for walks with the dogs, and being the best dog owner I could be. It's grown into building goals and having ambitions that define me outside of my wanting to be a mother, to have a family. (Big garden this year, re-started a lot of my hobbies and interests) 

I'm not saying this will all come together overnight. It's been a year since my 11 week loss and this has come together over that year.

Last week had my (usual, sigh) meltdown on CD 1. But some good came out of it. One, I was able to break down my upset and explain it (well I think!) to my husband. To me CD 1 represents 2 things - 

1) That we still aren't pregnant. And that really hits home the 18 months trying with nothing to show for it but heart burn and personal growth in the ability to grieve and be sad. So very much a ""Holy shit this is taking foreeeeeevvvvvver"" kind of sadness and frustration.

2) I get all those irritating PMS symtoms that are so close and yet not the same as what I felt each time I was pregnant. CD 1 those tender tits and burping and cramping remind me of how it felt each time I miscarried. And while CD 1 of a normal cycle isn't a miscarriage, it seems to remind and upset me of all those previous mc.

Anyways, It was nice for me to figure that out for myself, and it was helpful for me to be able to articulate it for my husband. 

Having said all that... I'm now a bit confused. CD 1 and CD 2 just like normal. But then nothing but spotting. very minimal spotting.

Pro tip, don't google ""2 day menstruation or 2 day period"" because the only answer is cancer or pregnancy. :/

I have not taken a hcg test. Why exactly I don't know. (That's not true.) It's because I'd rather not know. I'd rather continue on as I am right now, assuming that my uterus is just doing something new and funky and not have to worry about it. Honestly I'd rather not know I was pregnant right away.

I know that I am a &quot;super&quot; responder - I had 7 follicles on a low dose of Clomid, which all turned to cysts (that was not fun); had a &quot;good&quot; response to letrozole, but after 4 rounds of it found I had increasing issues with major depressive episodes, and then did a round of injectables with IUI that did not pan out either, but learned that I responded really quickly (triggered after 4 days on 50 iu).

Called my doctor's office, explained to the receptionist my history of CPs that haven't been documented and asked if I could come in today to do a blood test to confirm and/or whatever early monitoring thing they do.  Fortunately they had space and fit me in for 12pm today.

I also decided to tell to the other person in my department so he knows what's up and doesn't think I'm being lazy, interviewing elsewhere, abusing our company's lenient PTO/sick day policy, or just being irresponsible.  I explained that husband and I have been TTC with repeated early losses and as such I'll likely have a bunch of related doctor appointments.  I'll try to schedule them with the least amount of interruption to work as possible, but sometimes the appointment times offered are only within typical work hours.  He said no problem and he understands because his sister also had trouble getting pregnant so he's familiar with the process and the amount of appointments.  I thanked him, and asked that he not mention it to anyone else because I'd like to avoid fielding questions about it.

Even if this pregnancy doesn't hold, I hope that the blood test (or whatever happens today) will at least confirm it so we can get some documentation going.  If it comes back negative, then I guess I'll need to change the brand of pregnancy tests.

**Post-appointment update:** I should have expected that they'd want to do a urine test but I still peed before I left the office.  Not surprisingly with only 30 minutes for any sort of hCG to accumulate, the urine test came back negative, and only after 5+ minutes (at which point the test is invalid anyway) was there a squinter-of-squinters of a line.  So the doctor took a blood sample which he'll send off to a lab.  Results are expected back by noon tomorrow.  He was also a little surprised I had come back before my period was even late, so I explained that since there had been no official record for my previous 4 CPs (3 of which occurred right around when my period was due to start), I was nervous that we might miss it again this cycle so I came in as soon as I got a positive home pregnancy test.  He said he's glad I came back, since it is a fact that none of my previous CPs were confirmed via blood test, so hopefully if this is a positive we'd have our first official confirmation.  If nothing else, I guess I'll find out if the brand of pregnancy tests I've been using are just duds giving false positives.  So, we'll see.

**Update 2 & 3:** My gyn -- who I'll refer to as Dr. K from now on for brevity/readability -- called Thursday afternoon to inform me that I *am* pregnant (yay!).  The hCG number was very low (17.3), but within the range of what one might expect at ~10DPO.  He referred me to a high risk obstetrics specialist, Dr. A, and gave me a script to use to explain my situation.  It was just one sentence but I am immensely grateful for that so I'm not stumbling through how to most concisely but accurately convey a medical situation to people who are in all likelihood very busy.  Dr. K also told me that should I not be able to get an appointment with Dr. A next week, to go back and see him on Monday so that we can do another beta test.  Even if I should start miscarrying between now and then, I should still go in.  Dr. A's office was already closed by the time I called so that was put on hold until the next day, which is today.

This morning, Dr. K called again to give additional info about a blood test from my first visit to him, which was before I got pregnant.  I guess he reviewed it some more and while it was more or less normal, he noticed an abnormality with prolactin.  I don't remember if he said there was too much prolactin or there shouldn't have been any at all, but basically he noted that there have been some controversial studies suggesting that prolactin may affect a woman's ability to keep a pregnancy.  He can't say whether prolactin is to blame for my repeat MCs, but he wanted to let me know about it, and that this information will be entered into my records so that Dr. A will see it.  I asked if it could be left over prolactin from the miscarriage I had on 7/3 that hadn't cleared up yet when I saw him a week later.  He said that could be possible, but without any data from before that miscarriage, he can't say.  He further clarified that Dr. A is the head of the high risk obstetrics department, but I can see any of the doctors in that dept if Dr. A is unavailable.

Soooo I called Dr. A's office today, was asked a few questions to aid with matching up with the suitable specialist, and was told that Dr. A will review my file then get back to me within 1-2 business days to let me know if he'll take me on as his patient or refer me to one of his colleagues.  I asked *if* Dr. A were to take me on, about how soon I would be able to get an appointment.  The woman I spoke to said they may be able to squeeze me in next week, but if not then the week after.  With that uncertainty in mind, after I finished the call with Dr. A's office, I made an appointment with Dr. K on Monday to do a second beta test.

Finally, in case there is any confusion, Dr. K and Dr. A are both affiliated with the same major uh... hospital network, I guess, in my city.",[],,t1_dkp3uq9,False,0,[],False,"<div class=""md""><p>10dbo today and got a BFP.  Called my doctor&#39;s office, explained to the receptionist my history of CPs that haven&#39;t been documented and asked if I could come in today to do a blood test to confirm and/or whatever early monitoring thing they do.  Fortunately they had space and fit me in for 12pm today.</p>

<p>I also decided to tell to the other person in my department so he knows what&#39;s up and doesn&#39;t think I&#39;m being lazy, interviewing elsewhere, abusing our company&#39;s lenient PTO/sick day policy, or just being irresponsible.  I explained that husband and I have been TTC with repeated early losses and as such I&#39;ll likely have a bunch of related doctor appointments.  I&#39;ll try to schedule them with the least amount of interruption to work as possible, but sometimes the appointment times offered are only within typical work hours.  He said no problem and he understands because his sister also had trouble getting pregnant so he&#39;s familiar with the process and the amount of appointments.  I thanked him, and asked that he not mention it to anyone else because I&#39;d like to avoid fielding questions about it.</p>

<p>Even if this pregnancy doesn&#39;t hold, I hope that the blood test (or whatever happens today) will at least confirm it so we can get some documentation going.  If it comes back negative, then I guess I&#39;ll need to change the brand of pregnancy tests.</p>

<p><strong>Post-appointment update:</strong> I should have expected that they&#39;d want to do a urine test but I still peed before I left the office.  Not surprisingly with only 30 minutes for any sort of hCG to accumulate, the urine test came back negative, and only after 5+ minutes (at which point the test is invalid anyway) was there a squinter-of-squinters of a line.  So the doctor took a blood sample which he&#39;ll send off to a lab.  Results are expected back by noon tomorrow.  He was also a little surprised I had come back before my period was even late, so I explained that since there had been no official record for my previous 4 CPs (3 of which occurred right around when my period was due to start), I was nervous that we might miss it again this cycle so I came in as soon as I got a positive home pregnancy test.  He said he&#39;s glad I came back, since it is a fact that none of my previous CPs were confirmed via blood test, so hopefully if this is a positive we&#39;d have our first official confirmation.  If nothing else, I guess I&#39;ll find out if the brand of pregnancy tests I&#39;ve been using are just duds giving false positives.  So, we&#39;ll see.</p>

<p><strong>Update 2 &amp; 3:</strong> My gyn -- who I&#39;ll refer to as Dr. K from now on for brevity/readability -- called Thursday afternoon to inform me that I <em>am</em> pregnant (yay!).  The hCG number was very low (17.3), but within the range of what one might expect at ~10DPO.  He referred me to a high risk obstetrics specialist, Dr. A, and gave me a script to use to explain my situation.  It was just one sentence but I am immensely grateful for that so I&#39;m not stumbling through how to most concisely but accurately convey a medical situation to people who are in all likelihood very busy.  Dr. K also told me that should I not be able to get an appointment with Dr. A next week, to go back and see him on Monday so that we can do another beta test.  Even if I should start miscarrying between now and then, I should still go in.

A lot of crying and thoughts of ""I don't want this life,"" thinking about my son, etc. I've been working on diet and exercise which makes me feel better overall but maybe the subliminal message to my body that TTC isn't the priority has sent me backwards emotionally. I'm not sure. But this has been a rough time for me. I'm hoping things calm down soon for me.

I was thinking of asking my therapist for some type of medication to help me, like for anxiety, but she doesn't think I need anything and I'm fine, just grieving. I don't know when to define the point at which I will actually need something to help me? My lows lately have felt super low, so it's sometimes scary. But they pass. I don't know....

I just thought also that I was doing ""so well"" that I could work harder, along with diet and exercise hard, and my work associates (family) can be extremely annoying and draining at times, soooo I think this all set up for me to crash really badly yesterday and the day before. I felt so overwhelmed and I can only do 70 percent of the things I did pre-stillbirth. It was just TOO MUCH for me to handle, so I need to scale back.

Plus I'm the hardest on myself out of all of my family members. I'm very self-critical by nature. I work hard when other people are lazy, I try harder than everyone else at pretty much everything, I regularly feel unappreciated for all the work that I do....I have to chill out and take it easier.

Shes been really vocal about her three miscarriages and I follow her on social media, shes really down to earth and her blog posts about her losses have been so raw but magic to read. 

She announced today that she is 15 weeks pregnant, and I'm just so happy for her - a complete stranger. She wrote a blog post about her last loss and how she got pregnant this time. There's also a video of her announcing on air that shes pregnant, if you want to look. It's not a cheesy or an out there kind of announcement, she explains towards the end that she knows what its like to hear pregnancy announcements where you're happy for the person but also want to rip their faces off because of jealousy and sadness. Hit the nail on the head for me. I think that aspect of loss should be talked about more. 

Anyway here's the link. Obvious trigger warning - pregnancy announcement in the video and I think it auto-plays, but the blog might be interesting to some of you? It's made me feel really hopeful today and I've needed that over the last week or so.

Shes been really vocal about her three miscarriages and I follow her on social media, shes really down to earth and her blog posts about her losses have been so raw but magic to read. </p>

<p>She announced today that she is 15 weeks pregnant, and I&#39;m just so happy for her - a complete stranger. She wrote a blog post about her last loss and how she got pregnant this time. There&#39;s also a video of her announcing on air that shes pregnant, if you want to look. It&#39;s not a cheesy or an out there kind of announcement, she explains towards the end that she knows what its like to hear pregnancy announcements where you&#39;re happy for the person but also want to rip their faces off because of jealousy and sadness. Hit the nail on the head for me. I think that aspect of loss should be talked about more. </p>

<p>Anyway here&#39;s the link. Obvious trigger warning - pregnancy announcement in the video and I think it auto-plays, but the blog might be interesting to some of you? It&#39;s made me feel really hopeful today and I&#39;ve needed that over the last week or so.</p>

<p>and here&#39;s her first blog</p>

I know some people just leave their dog home when they work, but it's really not fair to the dog unless it is older and a less active breed - and that assumes that you don't get delayed at work. Most of my colleagues who do that also have dogs who have some behavioral issues. [Read: They often pee inside before the owners get home.] They might be able to manage being home alone all day, but they definitely don't like it. 

Having a dog when you don't have your own backyard is even more effort. Every time your dog goes potty, that means that you have to go outside as well - no matter the weather. For an adult dog, that means roughly every 4-5 hours, all day, every day - and dogs love to wake up early! 

Other costs to consider include healthy food, vet care, grooming (depending on the breed), and training. You can get breeds that don't shed, but you typically have to purchase them as puppies, which is dramatically more work than adopting an adult dog. Plus, they have more expensive grooming than breeds that do shed. 

Also super important to consider: what will happen once you do get pregnant. Having a dog with a newborn together presents extra challenges that you don't face with having one at a time. 

Oh also: in addition to having to clean up dog hair, even older dogs who come perfectly potty trained may have an accident or two inside when they first move to your home. Most dogs also will puke every so often - usually on the last place you want them to puke.

Are you imagining waking up at 2am to clean up puke, 6am to take it out on a leash to pee, paying several hundred for vet visits, and regularly reinforcing training and still thinking: worth it! Then go ahead and get a dog. If any of this has made you question if it's worth it, then it probably isn't. There are other ways to get the benefits of dog ownership without the commitment. Cats are much  easier and can be good for snuggles. You also could sign up on Rover.com and get paid to help with other people's dogs. Heck, if you live in NC, you are totally welcome to come get unlimited puppy snuggles with my dog.

I can relate so hard to this. Seeing everyone around me pregnant or with a newborn or expecting is just so damn hard.

Today I found a support group for toxoplasmosis, and in it are a few people with children who were born with it. Some of them are wheelchair ridden, a lot have microcephally, some are blind, some are severely incapacitated. Some are all of the above. A few just have migraines their entire lives. These are things I knew were risks associated with toxoplasmosis but I had no idea how high the chance your child having these issues was. 

When we found out I had toxoplasmosis (about a week before I started miscarrying), my husband was devastated, I didn't think it was that big of deal from the research I had done. He knew a bit better than me what it does to you (he's a vet but he got the idea of what it does to humans). We were waiting to hear back from my doctor about testing when I miscarried so we didn't need to decide what to do - amnio, termination, treatment etc. The emergency ultrasound measured the babies head at weeks behind his body, and I never made the connection until now. Denial maybe? 

My confession is that I am glad I miscarried. At first I felt bad that I felt that way - but then I thought ""hey, I freaking love women's reproductive rights, and I believe that TFMR in any case is the right of the mother, i would never judge another woman for feeling that way"". So I don't feel so bad. Just relief that he wouldn't have had any pain. 

I'm also really in awe of the mothers who do look after children born with congenital diseases or any other type of challenges. I know you adapt and you love them and in some or more cases your bond is deeper than normal. I don't think I'm strong enough to do it and it genuinely scares me in regards to having a child that might not be healthy, especially now. If the baby had of survived we might not have known anything was wrong until he was born because it was my husband who picked the toxo up first, a doctor wouldn't have tested for it without his prompting. 

Sorry if I offended anyone in this post, but I think I'm feeling a bit shocked and relieved at the same time and I don't think I could tell anyone in real life.

Some of them are wheelchair ridden, a lot have microcephally, some are blind, some are severely incapacitated. Some are all of the above. A few just have migraines their entire lives. These are things I knew were risks associated with toxoplasmosis but I had no idea how high the chance your child having these issues was. </p>

<p>When we found out I had toxoplasmosis (about a week before I started miscarrying), my husband was devastated, I didn&#39;t think it was that big of deal from the research I had done. He knew a bit better than me what it does to you (he&#39;s a vet but he got the idea of what it does to humans). We were waiting to hear back from my doctor about testing when I miscarried so we didn&#39;t need to decide what to do - amnio, termination, treatment etc. The emergency ultrasound measured the babies head at weeks behind his body, and I never made the connection until now. Denial maybe? </p>

<p>My confession is that I am glad I miscarried. At first I felt bad that I felt that way - but then I thought &quot;hey, I freaking love women&#39;s reproductive rights, and I believe that TFMR in any case is the right of the mother, i would never judge another woman for feeling that way&quot;. So I don&#39;t feel so bad. Just relief that he wouldn&#39;t have had any pain. </p>

<p>I&#39;m also really in awe of the mothers who do look after children born with congenital diseases or any other type of challenges. I know you adapt and you love them and in some or more cases your bond is deeper than normal. I don&#39;t think I&#39;m strong enough to do it and it genuinely scares me in regards to having a child that might not be healthy, especially now. If the baby had of survived we might not have known anything was wrong until he was born because it was my husband who picked the toxo up first, a doctor wouldn&#39;t have tested for it without his prompting. </p>

<p>Sorry if I offended anyone in this post, but I think I&#39;m feeling a bit shocked and relieved at the same time and I don&#39;t think I could tell anyone in real life. </p>

<p>Please don&#39;t kick me out I really like it here </p>

I'm never going to approach TTC from a place of like, loving my husband and our family so much that I just want to expand this love. From now until I'm absolutely sure I am done having kids, this is just going to be a function of a desperate overwhelming desire to populate my home with my offspring.

Anyways, today I visited an acupuncturist for a free consult.

She gave me some recommendations for supplements that can boost hormone regulation and we set up an appointment for when she returns from her vacation. But laying it all out like that made me just feel like one of those women who has substantial fertility problems who I have always really felt bad for-- like, ""oh, man, at least I don't have THOSE issues working against me."" But now I AM that woman with all those issues working against me! So that's discouraging.

Also, I saw someone above mention a tilted uterus? I have that too. As far as I am aware it has no bearing on fertility or anything, it's just a variation on the norm. With my firstborn no one ever even mentioned it but throughout my second pregnancy it was constantly remarked on because in the first trimester the position just made it a little trickier for them to find anything on an ultrasound.

I skimmed your comment history and I see it was only a few months ago. I am so very sorry. Truly. Six weeks old...I'm saying a lot of swear words out loud. 

Yeah after my son died I was absolutely petrified my husband was going to die. As in sobbing and clutching at him every night. I used to rest my head on his chest for hours listening to his heartbeat. Then he developed AFIB from the stress and I heard it one night while listening. They had to stop his heart and leaving that room that day to let them do that was as hard as walking away from my son at the hospital after we said goodbye. I was convinced he was going to die. 

It isn't your fault. I know you ""know"", but it needs to be said over and over for you. It is really common, many of my mom friends have dealt with it. Not to invalidate your fear, though. <3

I have a medical negligence lawsuit right now. We should talk sometime, privately if you'd like. PM me your Facebook or whatever you want, if you feel up to it. We are 3 years almost into the process. I don't know if you guys are pursuing that. 

Anyway, thank you for sharing that with us. Say hi to your little one from me and a feel better :)

We looked through his photo album and his ultrasound photos, I looked at all of his belongings that he never got to use and had a good cry. Then we rented a couple movies and ordered Chinese food and lit his memorial candle and stayed in on the couch. It wasn&#39;t anything super special, but it felt right to stay close at home and think of him and remember him and imagine what could have been on that day.</p>

The first 2, no regrets: both friends who have both been through 2 miscarriages. Both happen to be pregnant right now,  but they understood and that was all that mattered. It's not fair to see it this way, but I resent their pregnancies less because they've been through losses before and because they know how I'm feeling. 

Then 2 pregnant friends - one's a good friend who knew I was trying and that I was pregnant. I wanted her to know so we could share the experience. I had already been through a CP and I thought I was safe to tell her. Honestly, I wish she didn't know. It was raw having to tell her so shortly after it had happened. I am envious of her pregnancy.

The other is a less-good friend who saw me in the antenatal ward getting post-loss bloodwork. I had no choice, I wish she didn't know. She's sympathetic but has no insight and doesn't get that her pregnancy is hard for me to be around. 


The other person was my MIL. I needed her help with childcare the day of my MC. She was fantastic, but I still sting about the fact that she knows.

Basically I only regret telling people who have never been through pregnancy loss!",[],,t1_dkdkaxo,False,0,[],False,"<div class=""md""><p>I have told 5 people beyond my husband.</p>

<p>The first 2, no regrets: both friends who have both been through 2 miscarriages. Both happen to be pregnant right now,  but they understood and that was all that mattered. It&#39;s not fair to see it this way, but I resent their pregnancies less because they&#39;ve been through losses before and because they know how I&#39;m feeling. </p>

<p>Then 2 pregnant friends - one&#39;s a good friend who knew I was trying and that I was pregnant. I wanted her to know so we could share the experience. I had already been through a CP and I thought I was safe to tell her. Honestly, I wish she didn&#39;t know. It was raw having to tell her so shortly after it had happened. I am envious of her pregnancy.</p>

<p>The other is a less-good friend who saw me in the antenatal ward getting post-loss bloodwork. I had no choice, I wish she didn&#39;t know. She&#39;s sympathetic but has no insight and doesn&#39;t get that her pregnancy is hard for me to be around. </p>

<p>The other person was my MIL. I needed her help with childcare the day of my MC. She was fantastic, but I still sting about the fact that she knows. She&#39;s never brought it up since, and talks freely about pregnancy and next children as though it&#39;s a given. It&#39;s not insensitive or intentional, it&#39;s just a blind spot. She doesn&#39;t get it.</p>

<p>I have not told family and may never tell them. I don&#39;t want to cry over it in front of them as they&#39;re not the most supportive bunch. </p>

Make the appointment with your Dr. Go in, explain your positives with your bleeding. Ask for blood work to determine your betahcg levels. That will provide more clarity as to whether it's a chemical pregnancy or a viable one with some spotting to scare you. 

Also ask for a recommendation for counselling while you're there. This is to help you right now. 

As for hubby.... It can be hard for our partners to understand the daily mental toll this process takes. There are some amazingly well written articles out there that really well explain the mind fuck that is TTC after loss, TTC that takes months.....

Any time she got sick or had pain from gas or whatever I had triggers and assumed she was about to die, went to the hospital. I've screamed at a few doctors in a rage.

At about 9 months I got a lot more lax about things. I still imagine she is dead every time she sleeps a few minutes later than normal. The intrusive thoughts and envisioning her death is unfortunately common for loss parents. The first few months I couldn't feel that deep love as I had a wall up. 

I still expect her to die, and probably always will. As in, I am 100% convinced I will experience her death, so I prepare for it mentally by planning the dynamics of things when she does die. It is a burden that I will always carry.

It's obviously scary as all get out, and I take inspiration from women with late pregnancy loss who decide to go for it again, but I always hear ""I'm just so scared of all the things that can go wrong during pregnancy, I won't feel ok until the baby comes out.""

What do you do when you've had a totally normal pregnancy and a healthy baby? (We had a short NICU stay after a full term birth, but the docs sent us home saying she was fine.)

When will *I* feel safe? Once my next child is past three weeks? I don't think it's that easy. 

I really don't want to post this on a regular ttc thread because I don't see any reason that late (early, middle, anywhere really) loss moms should be burdened with the idea of a healthy baby dying after they've come home, but how the hell am I ever supposed to feel like we are in the clear?

Are there any infant loss parents out there who would chime in? I feel really alone with this. I remember just before my daughter was born being so annoyed with women who said that I shouldn't be so quick to get her out because at least when she was inside of me she was safe, even just experiencing an 11wk miscarriage I knew that wasn't entirely true.

I think my husband might be depressed and I'm not really sure how to broach it. A lot of things he says to me are snarky, he doesn't have a lot of patience. We have had a really rough week this week, I've felt like everything has been really strained. We had an argument a few nights  ago when he came home grumpy and was going off (swearing under his breath etc) about everything. I left my job due to an injury after my miscarriage so I am a stay at home mum and studying part time at the moment, and I keep the house SPOTLESS, but he was going around finding issues, baiting me to fight him. Finally I got upset and starting crying (mostly how I deal with frustration!) and he said 'I'll tolerate you crying over a dead fetus. I will not tolerate you crying for no reason'. Since then there has been a little argument every evening, and we don't usually argue. 

He's well known for being a bit abrasive, and not liking people. He's very sarcastic, but he's also really lovely to me usually. He's really is a fantastic husband. He was amazing during and after our miscarriage and I've never loved anyone more. 

But his hygiene has really gone downhill. I'm concerned this is a sign of depression. He showers far less often, and he doesn't brush his teeth everyday, I can tell. There's not as many of his clothes in the wash for me to do. This is very different to how he is normally, or at least before we got married. 

He swears he's fine, but he says things like 'every other qirlfriend I've had broke up with me because I was so grumpy - I can't believe you've lasted so long'. 

This is so probably not the place to vent about this, but I know how much he had invested in the baby that passed away, he wants another baby much more than I do, and his sperm count numbers are so low he's pretty much considered infertile. I think these
might be reasons why he's just let himself go - putting no effort into looking after himself or our marriage.

She also founded the MISS Foundation which is dedicated to helping bereaved parents get through difficult times. I'm thinking of using some of their resources and probably joining their forum. 
It helps that she comes from a Buddhist perspective, but she doesn't really focus on that in her writing. Her perspective is that we really have to allow ourselves to feel our grief in order to get through it. That society is SO numbing towards grief, thinking it's an illness that needs to be cured, when in reality it can become a companion and simply a way to channel our love for our lost ones. She writes about a lot of men and women who have fallen victim to repressed grief, and how it negatively affected their lives in other ways: alcoholism, estrangement from their families and friends, losing themselves--interests, passions, etc. she lists a lot of nice self care ideas and ways to move through your grief. And there's NO time limit to grief! I loved it, it was so compassionate and it really inspired me to take it easy on myself and know that I'm doing okay, I will be okay.

I am calmer than yesterday but this is all still shitty because AF cramps are continuing. I'm thinking of seeing a fertility specialist even though they will probably tell me to continue with OPKs and track my BBT, which I haven't done because it stresses me. I need to focus on self-care: exercise, yoga, eating healthy. I got a journal off of Amazon with prompts for child loss and grief. I'm going to start that. I'm also going to try to go to the cemetery tomorrow with my friend Farah. We never visited our kids together yet. It would be nice.

My husband disappointed me today. I told him I wasn't feeling up to going to his nieces daughters 1st birthday, that it would make me grieve because our kids were months apart and we were pregnant together and it's basically the same family members attending. He told me I need to try to remain logical with things like these because she isn't the same baby as our son, and I genuinely love her and love her parents. I see where he's coming from but I got upset because he just makes it seem like I'm overly emotional. I'm actually NOT. I'm a very rational person that isn't very emotional on the outside. I explained to him that I'm choosing to open up to him about my feelings and telling him this will upset me, and we talked about it some more, and he told me to be strong and that he loves me and blah blah blah. And ""his family really misses me, and they will love seeing me there, too."" He DID say he will completely understand when Riyads birthday comes and he knows we will both be upset on that day, but that I'm falsely linking this baby's birthday to my son's.

I can't really do much about him not understanding. I accept that. But I'm going to remain open and honest with him about my feelings. Oh, and I will go grieve my son however and whenever I please, I will go to the cemetery as much as I want and need, and I will tell him because I don't care. I used to worry that he wouldn't be on the same page as me...but he's not! He grieves differently. So fuck it. I need to do me with all of this hell. If that's going to entail grieving my son either alone, in this forum, or with other friends like Farah, that's perfectly fine. I'm finding an outlet through writing about my grief and speaking to all the lovely people on here and on other forums, as well as IRL loss moms. And I don't need him for that. 

One more thing: here were some quotes from that book I adored.

""We are all connected by suffering and loss, and unless we manage to avoid love, we will not avoid grief.""

""I know that life is fleeting, and sometimes children die. And I know that life promises us nothing. I know that forgiveness does not come easily in grief, especially toward myself. I know that no drink, no pill, no religion, and no book, can save me from suffering. I know people we love can and do die and that no one is exempt. I know that control is an illusion. I know that one day, one year, ten years, twenty years and fifty years is never enough time for those we love. I know there is nothing we can trade, nothing we can barter, nothing we can negotiate to bring our loved ones back to life--not even offering ourselves in their place.

Hi guys! So, quick birth story:

I was due 7/25. I had a scheduled C-section for July 27th if I didn't go into labor on my own before then since I wanted to Vbac! I went for my 38 weeks appointment and was 2cm dilated. My OB offered a membrane sweep to which I obliged because I was ready! I had been having intermittent painful contractions all weekend. She did the sweep at 9a and I was having super painful contractions by 1130a! They were 3 minutes apart. We got the the hospital around 2p and I was only dilated to a 3. I walked the hallways for an hour and progressed to a 4. At that point I was done with the pain (the contractions were 1-2 minutes apart at that point) and opted for an epidural. It was amazing guys! I had a very long labor with my son and I expected this to be the same. It was. I labored until 1a at which point I had a lot of pressure. I'd had quite a bit for awhile, but we decided to wait it out and see how much work my body could do on getting the baby out on it's own. It was a good choice because I did three contractions worth of pushing and she crowned. The nurse wasn't expecting it to be that fast and she ran out into the hallway to grab the doc. As soon as she did that, my body started pushing her out on it's own. My husband ran to grab the nurse and she made it back into the room just in time to catch the baby! The doc showed up about five minutes later, pissed. She was perfect and we just did skin to skin for awhile. I had very minor tearing and her head was perfectly round from coming out so fast! She latched like a champ and we have been hanging out at home for the last couple of days. 

Thank you to you all for the support here. It's been a crazy couple of years and you guys kept my sanity. ❤️ I don't know what I would have done without you.",[],,t1_dk9j91p,False,0,[],False,"<div class=""md""><p>I posted this super late last night, so posting again here. </p>

I know they're silly things to miss (I HATED THE TWW! What am I saying?). But I think I'm really just processing again how my path doesn't feel ""normal"" or what I always thought pregnancy should be like.

It has been over 2 years now and I still can&#39;t really open the closet I crammed all our nursery stuff into. I don&#39;t hurt the way I did then but it still aches every day.</p>

I was due 7/25. I had a scheduled C-section for July 27th if I didn't go into labor on my own before then since I wanted to Vbac! I went for my 38 weeks appointment and was 2cm dilated. My OB offered a membrane sweep to which I obliged because I was ready! I had been having intermittent painful contractions all weekend. She did the sweep at 9a and I was having super painful contractions by 1130a! They were 3 minutes apart. We got the the hospital around 2p and I was only dilated to a 3. I walked the hallways for an hour and progressed to a 4. At that point I was done with the pain (the contractions were 1-2 minutes apart at that point) and opted for an epidural. It was amazing guys! I had a very long labor with my son and I expected this to be the same. It was. I labored until 1a at which point I had a lot of pressure. I'd had quite a bit for awhile, but we decided to wait it out and see how much work my body could do on getting the baby out on it's own. It was a good choice because I did three contractions worth of pushing and she crowned. The nurse wasn't expecting it to be that fast and she ran out into the hallway to grab the doc. As soon as she did that, my body started pushing her out on it's own. My husband ran to grab the nurse and she made it back into the room just in time to catch the baby! The doc showed up about five minutes later, pissed. She was perfect and we just did skin to skin for awhile. I had very minor tearing and her head was perfectly round from coming out so fast! She latched like a champ and we have been hanging out at home for the last couple of days.

Here's my (super crazy ultra long, edited for reddit) post if you're interested:

So about 2 weeks ago, at what should have been 12.5 weeks, I had to terminate another pregnancy. I had a missed miscarriage. The fetus stopped developing at 7 weeks, but my body kept going as if everything was normal until my 12 week appointment when the miscarriage was diagnosed by ultrasound. I had 0 symptoms of miscarriage and looked and felt absolutely normal for 3 months along. (Actually, I was showing quite a bit and stressed about hiding it from students the last few weeks of school.) I even had morning sickness up until the morning of the D&C, which was especially cruel.

I decided I wasn't going to post anything publicly until we had more of an answer as to what is going on. I've had 3 miscarriages since September, and all of them have been because of a random genetic mutation. The past two have been situations where my body kept going with the non-viable pregnancies until I had to access abort!on care. The one we terminated at New Year's was a blighted ovum (super common, random genetic issue), and I found out today that this one was caused by Triploidy (rare random genetic issue where the fetus has 2 complete sets of chromosomes-- kind of cool from a science perspective, but I digress...). Neither of those are caused by genetic problems that can be inherited, they're just a fluke.

I'm going to see a fertility specialist at the end of the month for a second opinion on my fibroid tumors and to discuss everything. I'm a little overwhelmed by that idea since we've gotten pregnant immediately every time we've tried and the miscarriages don't indicate any issues other than us having shitty luck (which believe me, we already know). I feel like it's a little bit of overkill, but the extra monitoring will put my mind at ease and prevent me from continuing with a pregnancy for weeks and weeks when it isn't viable.

And that was what I was afraid of this time around. After that experience with my previous pregnancy where I had to terminate at 9 weeks because my body didn't miscarry naturally, I was paranoid the entire time that I would have a missed miscarriage. I spent every day worried that I was carrying a pregnancy that wasn't viable; it even started up again only an hour after we saw the heartbeat and were told that everything looked perfect. I wasn't able to feel good or optimistic about this pregnancy for more than a few hours at a time, and I would have been a complete and utter mess if not for all my friends constantly talking me down. So to everyone who helped me not go off the deep end, thank you. Seriously. I would not have stayed sane for the past few months without you.

I felt so uncomfortable in my pregnant body because I didn't want to be so big or feel so badly when I wasn't sure it would work out. I have never felt so uncomfortable in my own skin. I have never had an issue with feeling good about and accepting my body, but I hated seeing my belly grow. Now I have saggier breasts and a chubbier tummy but no baby. I still think I look great and am still comfortable with myself, but my new body is a reminder of how life and luck and fate just don't like us.

Somehow, finding out that the pregnancy wasn't viable and I would need another abort!on was a relief. It was exactly what I had been dreading the whole time, but just knowing what was happening was comforting. It was awful, and it was painful, but I knew for sure what was happening and what to do next.

I'm not devastated. I've felt so out of touch with what the expectation is for grief and emotions after a miscarriage, but in the time I have spent in reflection these past couple of weeks, I realized why. A miscarriage is the death of a future you imagined for your family and with your partner. And that's a huge thing for most couples (and I don't want to minimize anyone else's experience). But for us, it's a drop in a bucket that was already overflowing. 

When [husband's name] was diagnosed with MS 7 years ago, the future we imagined was completely destroyed. Knowing I will spend a lifetime slowly losing my husband to an unpredictable disease is a heartbreaking reality that I have had to come to terms with and will have to work through all over again every time he has a relapse. I have cried in public. I have spent months of my life grieving the future I'd imagined for us. He and I have had to relearn how to be together several times because MS doesn't just change you physically, it changes you emotionally and cognitively. We have had to adapt our ideal to fit our reality. We have struggled and fought this as partners, and we are stronger for it. But it beats us down sometimes. A first trimester loss-- hell, THREE first trimester losses in a row-- pale in comparison to the difficult reality that is chronic illness.

We know so little about what our future will bring. The future is uncertain for everyone, but an unpredictable and incurable illness makes you acutely aware of it in a way most people are not. It's difficult for me to ever imagine too far into the future because MS has made so much of our life together hard to predict. I never thought dealing with MS would make ANYTHING easier, but it definitely softens the blow of these losses. And finding out that it's just random genetic issues and probably nothing that will prevent us from eventually having a healthy child has me feeling pretty optimistic.",[],,t1_dk8msk5,False,0,[],False,"<div class=""md""><p>I&#39;ve shared my past two losses.

I will say that day will go down in history as one of the worst days I've ever gone through. 

The scariest part was the waiting before the surgery. I was put under general anesthesia so I got an IV. They will take you to the operating room place an oxygen mask over your nose and mouth and before you know it you will be in the recovery room. I was in recovery for about an hour after I woke up from the anesthesia since I was feeling dizzy, usually it's only about a half hour. After that you are free to leave. They gave me some disposable underwear and pads (use the undies for the first 24 hours my body was leaking weird fluids) I recommend getting some heavy flow overnight pads with wings.

The next three days I had some pretty bad cramping and was bleeding like a heavy period. My doctor explained that this is your uterus shrinking back down and the bleeding is due to the start of everything healing. (Heating pads and ibuprofen are a godsend for the cramps) I had pink to brown spotting on and off for the first 2 weeks. I started my period for the first time this week (4 1/2 weeks post d&c) and so far it has been the heaviest period I've ever had and I'm also experiencing more intense cramps. 

This might be a little TMI but my husband and I attempted to be intimate 2 weeks (which was how long we were told) after my d&c and it was extremely painful...we waited another week and it was mostly normal still a little discomfort, but I think that was more me being too much in my head.

One more thing your hormone levels may take a while to regulate and I think that was by far the hardest part. I cried at everything and anything for the first couple weeks. Remember you are grieving and your hormones make it so much worse, give yourself time and be patient with yourself. I still haven't gone more that a day without crying, it takes time.

<p>Good to hear from another couple our age, though, occasionally a think about how much different this whole process would be if I was ten years younger. I don&#39;t think we&#39;d be trying yet, that&#39;s for sure. </p>

Again, this is something I consider pretty fucked up. Because to buy into that, I have to think God gave me my baby dying for me to handle. It's essentially to me like someone saying, God chose you for your baby to die - cause you can handle it!  No, no no.

Anyway I know you mean well but this stuff is the exact stuff I can't contend with since I lost my son. I suppose we all look at this stuff differently. I just don't find it comforting at all.

These groups are open to everyone, because, as so many people have mentioned, the feelings of loss/loss of a future are all along the same lines. When I had my 11 week miscarriage I didn't go to a group, because I didn't think I belonged with the late losses. When my infant daughter died I didn't think I'd want to hear about people's early miscarriages, but I was desperate for anything that might help. 

The truth is, when you are going through the worst thing that's happened to you it's just that, the worst thing that has happened to you.

The group I went to had a whole host stories, a single girl on her second accidental pregnancy miscarriage, 28 week out of state TFMR, two first-trimester miscarriage couples, a woman who'd never been pregnant and was on her last IUI, our 3 week old daughter, another woman's 5 month old son, and a 22 week twin loss. 

And...... that leads me to the negative part of my experience. It was so totally emotionally draining to be in a room with loss parents telling their stories in person. I wasn't expecting that, and I guess I should have been. The other consideration is that one of the miscarriage dads that was there was a bit blindsided by all the other bad shit that can happen, and I think it's overwhelming if you've never thought about later pregnancy or infant loss. But if you're on this board you're not exactly naive.

I just really wanted to make it clear that these groups are meant for everyone, and no one is going to judge your loss or grade it on a scale.

In my state, we&#39;ve only seen 3 babies test positive for zika in the last year and a half, but we&#39;ve had about 20 positive mothers give birth. These moms were living in a zika endemic area, not just visiting. Not sure if that helps. I&#39;m also not saying that zika isn&#39;t serious, but it may not be as serious as people think it is.</p>

<p>If you love the islands you could also travel to Hawaii and not have to worry about zika at all. But I understand on wanting to go to St Maarten. :)</p>

Can't go to the West Coast, because my IL's live there and I don't want to visit them. Can't fly anywhere beyond 5 hours, because my husband is ridiculous. 

So, first world problems, but I guess I'll just stay home and cry that day because there's nothing better to do.

I&#39;m two months behind on my thesis because I just can&#39;t focus. Meaning I can&#39;t graduate until at least September, but more like December (because my advisor is lazy). Meaning no one will hire me because they think I&#39;m still in grad school and no one actually reads cover letters or anything. Meaning I&#39;m stuck, unemployed, for months on end. </p>

<p>We had been planning a trip to Mexico over my due date to soften the blow (was very excited, I&#39;ve never been, and my husband has always said, &quot;never again!&quot;), until I remembered Zika is still a thing, and we&#39;re TTC. Fuck. I&#39;ll have enough to worry about with losing an upcoming pregnancy, so now it&#39;s off the table. Nothing else sounds appealing. Can&#39;t go anywhere in the Carribean! Can&#39;t go to the West Coast, because my IL&#39;s live there and I don&#39;t want to visit them. Can&#39;t fly anywhere beyond 5 hours, because my husband is ridiculous. </p>

<p>So, first world problems, but I guess I&#39;ll just stay home and cry that day because there&#39;s nothing better to do.</p>

<p>I&#39;m so so so angry that I can&#39;t seem to get back to my normal state. My husband did. The rest of the world did. Why can&#39;t I? Why can&#39;t I focus, and get my damn thesis done, so I can move on with my life? Why does my due date have to be a big deal? I feel like I can&#39;t talk to anyone because they all think I should be &quot;over it.&quot; And while I&#39;ve come to accept my loss, and be as okay with it as I can be, it&#39;s just not enough. I feel more angry that I&#39;ve lost myself than having lost my baby.</p>

<p>Just.
Fuck.</p>

After hanging out in the ER for 5+ hours, I don't really have any answers. Ultrasound had things measuring exactly as they should and heart rate was strong.

But these guys refuse to even TEST my progesterone levels, and I just can't get past that.

I'm a little worried about spending a whole week without him in the wake of our loss, but I have a cousin coming to town with her 2yo in a few days to keep us company so that should break up our week really nicely. Now that I'm back I can feel the familiar sadness settling back in but I also know now what life looks like when you don't spend every single second replaying your stillbirth in your mind, so the sadness feels less acute, I think.

I told myself that I've really done everything I possibly could to conceive this cycle, and I'll be relaxed through this two week wait. Five minutes later I googled, ""does fertility increase in the immediate postpartum period?"" So clearly it's going great.

My wife and I lost our little boy, Walker, at 19w in March 2015. There are many ways in which our stories are similar - because of incompetent cervix my wife's water suddenly broke and our doctors told us the same thing. That even if they could stop labor that there was no fluid and our little boy would die anyway. We made the same choice and induced/sped up labor. Our son was still alive when he was born, kicking, heart beating, but he never took a breath and he died in my wife's arms. We held him and the nurses took pictures. It was torture for us to walk out of those hospital doors without him, just like it was torture for you.

I can relate to some of the feelings you express regarding people's misconceptions. My wife's paperwork deems what happened a termination but we made the same choice you did for the same reasons - it seemed like the only thing to do and it gave us the chance to meet our son rather than have him die slowly and risk infection.

",[],,t1_dk61mam,False,0,[],False,"<div class=""md""><p>I am so very sorry for your loss. My wife and I lost our little boy, Walker, at 19w in March 2015. There are many ways in which our stories are similar - because of incompetent cervix my wife&#39;s water suddenly broke and our doctors told us the same thing. That even if they could stop labor that there was no fluid and our little boy would die anyway. We made the same choice and induced/sped up labor. Our son was still alive when he was born, kicking, heart beating, but he never took a breath and he died in my wife&#39;s arms. We held him and the nurses took pictures. It was torture for us to walk out of those hospital doors without him, just like it was torture for you.</p>

<p>I can relate to some of the feelings you express regarding people&#39;s misconceptions. My wife&#39;s paperwork deems what happened a termination but we made the same choice you did for the same reasons - it seemed like the only thing to do and it gave us the chance to meet our son rather than have him die slowly and risk infection.

Waiting 1 cycle is *most commonly* for dating purposes. But there are MANY other reasons, on a case by case basis. So nobody here can fully answer that for you. :(

In your case, after a D&C you should not have sex/take a bath/have anything in you vagina for ~14 days. Or longer if you are still bleeding at all. This timeframe puts most people ""out"" on that cycle due to ovulation time. Not all people though - if you ovulate later you could still conceive. 

After a D&C its *possible* that your lining may be thinner than usual, which makes it possible you could not sustain an immediate pregnancy. The surgery process isn't meant to do that, but depending on the doctor and what they had to do, it can happen.

After talking to your doctor to see if there is a medical reason other than dating, its up to you how long you wait. Emotional and physical toll should both be taken into account, but its impossible to know how you'll feel in a few days or weeks.

Sure, it was the worst pain I ever have experienced... but it could have been so much worse overall. There are a lot of Super Women in this forum!</p>

I was willing to trust in my midwives and take that chance, since I was otherwise healthy, but you have to decide if that&#39;s something you may be willing to deal with or maybe seeing if you can find another doctor that will offer some testing. Again, I&#39;m sorry and I hope that you can come to a comfortable solution. </p>

<p>Fast forward to my due date month. Of course...they had a baby girl. I felt like it was another big &quot;fuck you&quot; from the universe. Our daughters would be so close in age and growing up together. I still haven&#39;t met my niece and don&#39;t know when I&#39;ll be ready. I don&#39;t even want to be around them at holidays. I will see my niece experience all the things my daughter won&#39;t. I don&#39;t know how I&#39;m going to look at her and not think about my daughter. A constant painful reminder of what should be. I feel so angry and bitter about the situation. We&#39;re not close with my BIL and his wife at all. Everything has been so awkward since everything happened. We don&#39;t want to talk to our families much. Nobody understands the gravity of our grief.</p>

<p>&quot;It&#39;s not fair.&quot; -Three words that continue to loop through my brain everyday.</p>

My MIL posted his picture to Facebook and said, &quot;Our second grandson this year.&quot; To be honest, I&#39;m glad she mentioned my baby, but dammit guys. I want my boy to be alive, too. &quot;It&#39;s not fair.&quot; I just want the pain of it all to be over. They&#39;re done with having kids, so hopefully I don&#39;t have to deal with them again, but I have an unmarried BIL and my other SIL only has one daughter. I doubt they&#39;re finished. I just don&#39;t know if I can handle all this again. But I don&#39;t want to force myself into TTC just to &quot;catch up&quot;. I&#39;m so ready to love on another baby.

I finally picked them up today. I only had one picture of my daughter from my scan many months ago. The photo they printed out for me wasn't that great. My daughter was sucking her thumb and blocked the view of her nose. Another local loss mom told me that she asked for ultrasound pictures of her son. I never even thought that I could request them from the hospital. They were kind enough to copy all the photos to a CD for no charge. 

I was nervous opening them. There was so many mixed emotions swirling inside me. I was mesmerized by each photo and studied them all very closely. I wanted to see every feature and detail of my perfect baby girl. I teared up seeing my daughter's hands, feet, legs, butt, and girl parts. There was a close up profile picture where I finally saw her nose. I stared at the photo and wondered about who she would have been. She should be three months old and with us. I broke down and had a really good cry. I've been suppressing my feelings for awhile. A major grief wave hit me like a ton of bricks. 

The CD also had the ultrasound photos confirming fetal demise. I remember refusing to look at the screen when they told me there was no heartbeat. I froze at my laptop...but slowly looked through all the images. I'm sure it was a mistake on their part to include them on the CD. I don't know why I looked at them. How does a perfectly healthy baby die? Why did my daughter have to die? She passed the anatomy scan with flying colours.

",[],,t1_djxg9e3,False,0,[],False,"<div class=""md""><p>I asked the hospital for pictures of my 20 week ultrasound. I finally picked them up today. I only had one picture of my daughter from my scan many months ago. The photo they printed out for me wasn&#39;t that great. My daughter was sucking her thumb and blocked the view of her nose. Another local loss mom told me that she asked for ultrasound pictures of her son. I never even thought that I could request them from the hospital. They were kind enough to copy all the photos to a CD for no charge. </p>

<p>I was nervous opening them. There was so many mixed emotions swirling inside me. I was mesmerized by each photo and studied them all very closely. I wanted to see every feature and detail of my perfect baby girl. I teared up seeing my daughter&#39;s hands, feet, legs, butt, and girl parts. There was a close up profile picture where I finally saw her nose. I stared at the photo and wondered about who she would have been. She should be three months old and with us. I broke down and had a really good cry. I&#39;ve been suppressing my feelings for awhile. A major grief wave hit me like a ton of bricks. </p>

<p>The CD also had the ultrasound photos confirming fetal demise. I remember refusing to look at the screen when they told me there was no heartbeat. I froze at my laptop...but slowly looked through all the images. I&#39;m sure it was a mistake on their part to include them on the CD. I don&#39;t know why I looked at them.

She adamantly blamed the flu shot because it was the only thing she did differently in her final pregnancy.

I tried to comment and tell her it's not the flu shot, it's not her fault either...and she responded to everyone basically shutting them down, saying ""thanks"" but ""knows the cause is the flu shot because of all the thimerosal and mercury injected is deadly for pregnant women/infants.""

Had a difficult pregnancy, I gave up working at 9weeks due to Hyperemesis. I lost 25 kg in ten weeks.

My results were extremely high and I was told to come in to my doctors to talk about treatment ASAP. I was to get an amniocentesis to check to see if the infection has passed over to the placenta (toxo causes blindness, brain damage and microcephalic symptoms) The night before I was due to go in I started bleeding, and the next day at an ultra sound we were told the baby had passed at 14 weeks (we were 18 weeks at the time). Tests came back and showed it was a boy (George) and it had died from toxoplasmosis. I feel really lucky to know what it was that killed him.

When to try again is dependent on so many factors, often different for each person. Obviously there is the emotional factor, but nobody can answer that for you, unfortunately. :(  

Physically, its also very different depending on the type of loss you had, the timing of the loss (how far along), and if you had a need for surgery/meds/etc. 

If you had an early and physically uncomplicated loss (especially one that didn't require surgery), trying right away is usually fine. You're most often told to wait a cycle *mainly* for dating purposes -- but there could be other reasons depending on your specific case. Waiting until after your first period and then trying on that cycle is very common and usually fine.  If a doctor tells you to wait for longer, there is often a reason (often, but not always - some docs need more education) and you should be speaking to them about it. Sounds like yours is fine with waiting for just the 1 period, so that's good news. The need for a D&C or methotrexate and the type of loss that is a molar pregnancy all usually mean a longer wait, but it sounds like you're in the clear on those!

For about a year now I've been disappointed after each period comes. In November we began TTC, but never charted temps, took OPKs, etc. We kinda just said ""if it happens, it happens.""

So here are my questions for you:

1) Am I crazy to want to try again ASAP after I stop bleeding from the miscarriage? I know my doctor will probably want me to try after my first cycle, but would it be detrimental for me to start trying after my first period returns?

2) What methods do you find to be most effective in tracking ovulation? From my research, it seems that temping is the way to go but I'm concerned it'll take awhile to see a pattern because my periods are irregular. And OPKs sound great, but they are more of a prediction from what I've seen.

About 10 years ago I was diagnosed with PCOS, and we saw an RE for a while. At the time we weren't super desperate for kids, though we knew we would be in the near future. We wanted to know what we were up against and it didn't look good. 

We didn't have any luck for a few years, but we also weren't trying every single cycle, we had a planned move across the country and had agreed to start clomid as soon as we were settled in. 

In April of 2015 I got pregnant spontaneously and had a miscarriage at around 5 weeks. We never saw an OB or midwife, and with super wonky cycles I can't be exactly sure. Honestly, I was a little excited... *I* said to myself and my husband ""well, at least we can get pregnant!""

Our second miscarriage happened at 11 weeks about 7 months later. Because of the first pregnancy we decided to try a bit without intervention. Before the loss we'd seen an OB multiple times and had tracked the growth on ultrasound. Knowing what I do now I realize that there were early signs that things weren't going well, but the OB remained positive so my husband and I didn't ""get it"" for lack of a better phrase. We lost the baby a week after we learned that we might be having twins, although we only ever saw one heartbeat. 

I alternately refer to that pregnancy as one or two babies, which is a weird inconsistency I have. 

We didn't see an RE in our new town, and our OB and later midwives agreed that sometimes a pregnancy can ""reset"" you hormonally and more pregnancies can follow. Honestly, I didn't find ""regular"" OBs knowledgeable about infertility issues, but I did get pregnant again just with temping and OPKs, so I wasn't too worried. 

TW: from this point on I talk about stuff that went wrong after a healthy birth. Please do not read any further if it's likely to foster worry/stress. ❤️💚💙

We got pregnant again a few months later and getting past the first trimester was stressful, but other than that it wasn't a particularly difficult pregnancy. I didn't exactly enjoy being pregnant, but that was obviously never the end goal, so I felt like it was easy to put up with. 

Our daughter was born after a pretty cool unmedicated birth, but she was taken to the NICU right away with breathing problems. My husband went with her, and she was brought back to our room later that night. I was still not supposed to get up, but my husband heard her struggling (it was very late at night and we'd been told to go to sleep, so we have always fought with the ""what ifs"" there), when he got up to see her she was blue, and he pressed the emergency call button for the NICU. 

A moderately shortened version of our sorry follows:

She was released after five days of observation, since they couldn't find anything wrong with her they chalked it up to the fluid they'd found in her lungs, super common. She had a little heart murmur that we tracked with her regular doctor and later specialists, each appointment the heart conditions piled on and we were facing open heart surgery. The prognosis was very good, however, so she stayed home with us and everything was relatively normal. 

We were very fortunate that she stopped breathing while we were waiting for a CT scan at a major children's hospital in our area, but even with immediate intervention we discovered that her tracheal defects, often associated with heart defects, were too great and there was no surgical intervention that would save her. We had to make the choice to take her off of life support. 

It's been almost five months since she died. I'm still dealing with some uncomfortable physical postpartum details, but I'm ready to try and get pregnant again. I can't possibly live in a world where not only do we not get to parent our daughter, but where we don't get to parent any children. My husband might never be ready. He already felt like an older dad, and he has PTSD from the whole situation (not that I don't, but he deals with things differently). 

I desperately hope this doesn't drive a wedge between us, and we are very open with each other and do our best to air things before they become an issue, but this is bar none the hardest thing I've ever had to face both in our relationship and life in general. 

I can say without any sense of cliche that every waking moment is pure agony. I not only struggle with the loss of our daughter, but I have to struggle with the loss of the dream of parenthood all over again. 

I tell my husband when we get home from work each night how proud I am of us for just getting through the day.

I was SO not ready for kids. We're financially stable, but I was kinda enjoying travelling, doing spontaneous things and saving up to put a deposit down on a house. I had a terrible pregnancy in terms of how I felt - HG, heartburn/reflux, horrible back and hip pain. Overall it was normal, I flew through every midwife appointment and scan. Classed as a low risk pregnancy.

At my 34 week appointment on June 8th everything was great. Midwife commented that everything was perfect, baby's heart beat was great and he was measuring 36 weeks.

Late 9th June/early 10th June (Friday into Saturday) I didn't feel much movement. I fell asleep, then when he didn't kick after waking up to pee for the 2nd time I called the hospital and they had me come in. Told me to eat and drink before coming in because they were sure baby would be kicking up a storm by the time I got there.

They couldn't find his heartbeat at the hospital. They gave me the drugs to try and kick start things, I was admitted into hospital on the 12th and eventually gave birth on the 14th of June to my beautiful baby George. The midwife couldn't see anything obviously wrong (didn't see evidence of cord accident or anything like that). 

So now we're grieving and I so desperately want another baby to pour our love into. Despite hating every second of pregnancy and not planning for it, we're going to start trying again after my first cycle. 

Hopefully by the time we want to start trying we'll have the results from the post-mortem to see if there was a cause. We were told 50% of the time or more there isn't an obvious cause of death, so we're preparing for that.

The best advice I have for TTC is to pretend you're already pregnant. Keep taking those prenatals (studies suggest that taking them 3+ months before TTC gives you the maximum benefit), limit smoking and drinking, do some moderate exercise, eat well, and limit or eliminate caffeine. 

Lots of those TTC here use OPK (ovulation predictor kits), which you can buy in bulk on Amazon (~50 for $12). If you use them 1-2x a day after the 10th-ish day after your period starts, it can predict ovulation roughly 12-36 hours before it happens, so you can have sperm there to meet the egg. Studies indicate that using OPK can increase your chances to conceive by ~10% (up to 40% or so for any given cycle). Others just do the ""sex every other day"" method, as sperms live approx. 12-48 hours (don't quote me on that number, or really any of these, they could be a smidge different). And some using the temping method, but I don't know know a whole lot about it, but I *think* you take your basal body temperature vaginally the second you wake up every morning, and when your temperature spikes significantly, you've ovulated.

That is perfectly okay and completely normal. People aren't thinking you want to replace him, so don't worry if you think people think that. I also kept saying that to people so they understood I wanted HIM back more than anything. I had so many people say ""don't worry, you'll have another baby"" whenever I cried, as if that was why I was sad, which really angered me. They didn't mean that I just wanted a baby, they were just saying whatever they could to comfort me in that moment because they wanted me to not feel pain, and didn't have time to think how that may come across.

It is replacing one baby for another, in a logical technical sense, and there is absolutely zero wrong with that because you need a baby in your arms. But it is not replacing your son or dishonouring your love for him. Your love for him isn't reduced nor are you betraying him for wanting another baby.

It was a PITA to pump, and I was thrilled at 1 oz. a day. Total 18 oz. over the course of a month. Small, but I'm proud of it. 

I tried to get an LC to look at me in the hospital, but they really tried to shake me off. I knew it was likelier than not that I'd produce; I'd still been able to make decent drips up until a few months into my pregnancy. Within a half hour of knowing my son was gone, I knew I wanted to do this. I struggled through hell and back to breastfeed my daughter, and failed in as many ways as I succeeded. If I had the opportunity to save a life from the life that was lost, then I was going to take it. 

It took me a few days to notice that I was dripping in the shower, and wasn't sure what to think. I own several breast pumps and all the supplies from my first kid, so I just went with it. I was in the position to take a long leave of absence from work, so I started pumping. 8-12x a day, drank 100 oz. of water, and ate and drank everything I remembered that could help build supply.

Obviously my supply never ""built."" I think it was just too early, and I didn't have enough hormones to keep it going. I dried up about a month in. But it gave me something to focus on. Every 2 hours, I pumped, because I had to. Someone needed me. I had to provide for them. I had to make up for what I felt I had done to my son. 

Interestingly, this helped me more than my LC did. I felt very comfortable ""weaning"" at a month. It didn't effect the return of my cycle too much; AF arrived 5 weeks after my induction, and again 32 days later. So in this way, it didn't effect my fertility, AFAIK. If you went full pedal-to-the-metal and got a huge supply, my best guess would be that it could affect your fertility, but decreasing your pumps per day should fix that. My cycle returned after 9 months PP with my daughter, when she stopped feeding 10x a day and went to daycare. 

I'm working with the Milk Bank, a quick Google search or a call to an LLL member can connect you. It typically starts with a phone interview, then a longer survey, then a blood test, and then you can donate. My bank offers free bags, bottles, hospital-grade pump rentals, coolers, whatever you need. They also cover the blood test you'll need to get done to prove you don't have any infectious dieseses (this is what I did today). My bank also has a memorial in their main office for babies whose lives were lost, and whose mother's donated afterwards. 

If you want to try, you're providing a wonderful gift. If you don't, that's okay, too. If you want to do it for a week, then try it for a week. I reevaluated every week to make sure it was what I still wanted, and one week, it wasn't. But if you think you want to try, time is really of the essence to build supply.

The other thing that I really like about the whole thing is breastmilk jewelry. I have a pendant from when I was breastfeeding my daughter, and have decided to save a little bit of my donation for another one for my son. The lady who does them for me says about 0.5-1 oz. is typical for these types of things. I don't have pictures or prints or even a name for my son.
