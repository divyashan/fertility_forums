We are coming up on 2 years trying, with three losses. The last loss was ....11?12? 1000000? cycles ago. (Feb 2017)

So I've been giving up in ways that increase my sanity and reduce my insanity. The first thing to go (and that was a year ago) was I stopped temping after O was confirmed. That helped. Then about 10 months ago I stopped temping all together. That helped because then I didn't have to wake up every morning and think about TTC and our never ending quest.

I used to have a fit bit, it happened to break (as they often do, the construction is only soso) right after my last miscarriage. Not knowing my resting heart rate has been helpful too.

So now, mostly we have sex when we feel like it. Which is fine. When our schedules don't allign to have sex in the FW, we just shrug and go okay. It gives me 3 or even 4 weeks of not having to care about ttc. Which is kind of nice,

Life is unfair and cruel sometimes but it is beautiful that you are not letting it break you. I will keep you in my prayers and thank you for writing back to my post as well. </p>

I‚Äôve gone back to (mostly) lurking here because I‚Äôve been trying to manage my grief in a new/different way and my cycle is extra long at the moment so there‚Äôs not a lot to talk about day to day on that front. 

It‚Äôs been a long time since I‚Äôve been so relieved to get my period. CD50 and it just showed up. I normally ovulate around CD21-26, and all signs pointed to ovulation right around then (I don‚Äôt currently temp-more on that later). It was our first month with SMEP and I was so proud of us, but even when I‚Äôd ‚Äúmissed‚Äù my period I never felt pregnant, and pretty much knew it was going to be a long cycle. 

I‚Äôm in kind of a weird place, I don‚Äôt have great insurance at the moment and we just moved, so I no longer have access to my old midwives, although I‚Äôm 36, I‚Äôd like to hold off on going to the dr. for the next couple of cycles (this was #4 since I got off BC after my daughter‚Äôs birth, and looking back we didn‚Äôt really try that hard on 1+2). BUT before I managed to get pregnant relatively easily 3 times in 2 years I‚Äôd been diagnosed with PCOS (although I‚Äôve never had symptoms of a cyst?) Just when we planned to take the next step I got pregnant with my first miscarriage, then my second, then my daughter who passed as an infant (we definitely were active TTC for the second two, but it took 1 and 2 cycles respectively and my cycles were perfect all that time).

I know I need to start temping, but I‚Äôve been hesitant to since before pregnancy #2, when I was (weirdly) working a 9-5 job. Now I‚Äôm doing my regular schedule, which normally sees me going to bed around 2/3 and getting up between 10/11 (I need my 8 hours when I can get it!) Does anyone with and odd schedule temp and do you have any advice? Setting an alarm for 7/8 and hopeful going back to sleep? (On my days off I usually go to bed a lot earlier and wake up earlier‚Äîkind of the opposite problem others might have.)

I guess I just need a little motivation/advice on the temping front. I feel a little sheepish being ‚Äúsurprised‚Äù that this is going to take actual work, since I‚Äôve been told since I was a teenager it could be difficult and we were NTNP for SIX YEARS before deciding to take action (and subsequently getting pregnant naturally just before we did).

But then I realized: it&#39;s because he loves me. He&#39;s just glad I&#39;m still here. And that&#39;s made a huge difference. And we just had another big conversation about this a few days ago. It just takes time. </p>

<p>I will say though, my biggest hang up that I still have not done yet is oral. We used to love it but no way am I letting him near there yet. I&#39;ve always felt for me that&#39;s more vulnerable than normal sex. I&#39;m too scared so we&#39;ll keep taking things slow. We&#39;re back to beginning to have fun so there&#39;s that! I&#39;m always here if you want to vent, I&#39;m rooting for you!</p>

A few things that help me:

* Using the manta of ""Different egg, different sperm, different pregnancy."" This is not the same and doesn't mean it will have the same outcome.
* Remembering that physical symptoms mean very little, either direction. You can be sick constantly and miscarry or you can not have a symptom the whole time and be fine. Or vice versa. Try not to let them stress you out.
* Knowing that nothing you do can really impact the outcome - no everyday thing you do is going to cause you to miscarry.
* Reminding yourself that you survived this once...and while nobody should have to do it once, and definitely not more...you know you can survive. If it happens again, you can get through it and you aren't alone.

I see you got a Doppler. That can be great, but also cause anxiety. I'd suggest waiting a couple more weeks to try it, as its VERY hard this early. But also to watch some videos or have someone teach you how to use it. If you get the Doppler and then can't find the heartbeat, that's COMMON -- its not super easy early on and definitely not the first time. 

Good luck!! It's hard and we know that...but its what you want and unfortunately we have to get through the hard shit to get the happy ending.

Ovulation was/is most likely today so maybe that's part of it.

I spoke with my dad on Tuesday night and he belittled my miscarriage experience by calling 3 losses 'not getting pregnant'. Now I am aware that not getting pregnant is HARD and heartbreaking, but conceiving and losing 3 pregnancies - the joy, hope, crushing disappointment, not to mention all the fucking blood - make it qualitatively very different. Of course, I didn't go into detail with my father about the blood, the six transvaginal scans to confirm an empty uterus, etc etc. I know he and my stepmother went through a stuggle to conceive my brother (her first child - she does not talk about it) but saying 'getting pregnant is just voodoo sometimes, there's no way to know why/what is happening' just fucked me up for a few hours because it wiped out a large, fairly significant, portion of my experience, probably just avoiding discomfort on his part.

[mention of my LC below] Then yesterday some friends who had invited us to their family getaway between xmas and new year cancelled on us. In my head I know it's because they've just had their second baby (born the day I miscarried a third time) & a sibling also has a new baby who will be staying so it would be chaos, too much for the grandparents. But in my heart I ache, because that's the kind of chaos I want in my own house, and I might never get it. Plus they're excluding us essentially because of our 2y/o who is really chill and no trouble 99% of the time (and would occupy their kid, making things easier for them IMO). Whatever.

Then a local shopkeeper who is usually so friendly was kinda rude to me and made me feel boring. 

As I said, hormotional. If my calculations are correct we hit O-1 and O-3 - good enough.

My hair is starting to fall out and that isn‚Äôt supposed to happen in this stage.. it could be stress related, but I won‚Äôt be relieved until the scan tomorrow... my nausea medication isn‚Äôt working great anymore. I get sick every morning when I step into the shower...</p>

 I have mixed feelings about this, of course I&#39;m so relieved and happy it probably means I won&#39;t have to have another D&amp;C, but it also means everything is gone and over.
 Blood taken for HCG, lupus and antiphospholipid antibodies, folic acid - i should take in a different form (active form, have written it down somewhere, that&#39;s in case my body doesn&#39;t process the standard form), aspirin not necessary, green light for sex!
 TTC after 2 cycles. Talked to two doctors and neither of them wanted to discuss anything. Wait 2 cycles they said, women usually don&#39;t listen to this advice they said after a while of me bothering them. </p>

Last night, I joked around with my husband that I'm nervous about the ultrasound, etc., but I didn't realize just *how* stressed out I was!  Went to bed at 11:30pm, and had a dream where the ultrasound revealed lumps of stuff in my uterus.  These lumps looked like... I dunno, a torn up loaf of pumpernickel bread.  I woke up at around 2:30am, totally freaked out.  Had a hard time getting back to sleep because I felt so sick from the dream and a wave of nausea, but I think I finally fell asleep around between 3:30am and 4:00am, after which I had a dream that we had totally overslept and missed the entire appointment.  I spent the dream trying to call the doctor's office, but my phone was at 1% battery so I was trying to call from another phone but didn't have the number saved.  Then people kept interrupting me so I couldn't finish punching in the number.  I jolted awoke again at 4:30am, realized it was still super early, and struggled to go back to sleep.  I finally did and woke up when the alarm went off at 6:45am.  I had another weird dream, but I can't remember what it was, other than that it pertained to the ultrasound appointment.

Needless to say, I did not sleep well at all and was a bit of a mess.  We ended up 15 minutes late to the appointment because one of the trains we needed to take took its sweet time showing up.  There was also some confusion with paperwork (I needed to fill in a new intake form since this was for a ""new"" pregnancy), so by the time we actually saw my OB, it was 30 minutes after the appointment time.  But, we got to see him!

As for the ultrasound itself, OB found the yolk sac, found the embryo, and we got to hear the heartbeat!  119bpm, which OB said was as good as we can expect to get at this stage.  I thought I might start crying in joy but I was just in too much shock because it felt so surreal.  The embryo was too small to measure accurately, so the OB asked if I'd like to go back next week or the week after.  I told him I'd like to go back next week, and he said we should be able to get a more accurate measure then, which should lead to a more accurate EDD.  Got 10 vials of blood drawn for prenatal testing, and a complementary (or promo) tote for the hospital as well as a pregnancy book on my way out.

Last night, I joked around with my husband that I&#39;m nervous about the ultrasound, etc., but I didn&#39;t realize just <em>how</em> stressed out I was!  Went to bed at 11:30pm, and had a dream where the ultrasound revealed lumps of stuff in my uterus.  These lumps looked like... I dunno, a torn up loaf of pumpernickel bread.  I woke up at around 2:30am, totally freaked out.  Had a hard time getting back to sleep because I felt so sick from the dream and a wave of nausea, but I think I finally fell asleep around between 3:30am and 4:00am, after which I had a dream that we had totally overslept and missed the entire appointment.  I spent the dream trying to call the doctor&#39;s office, but my phone was at 1% battery so I was trying to call from another phone but didn&#39;t have the number saved.  Then people kept interrupting me so I couldn&#39;t finish punching in the number.  I jolted awoke again at 4:30am, realized it was still super early, and struggled to go back to sleep.  I finally did and woke up when the alarm went off at 6:45am.  I had another weird dream, but I can&#39;t remember what it was, other than that it pertained to the ultrasound appointment.</p>

Something clicked with me in this sentence. Today, 11 days post D&c, I went to the gym because I felt like I needed to start the tough love part of the self care process and do things that were good for me even if I don't feel like it. I went to a zumba class. I didn't have fun. I didn't get an endorphin rush, but I got my heart rate up and I burned some calories even though I felt in a sour mood for being there.

Today, 11 days post D&amp;c, I went to the gym because I felt like I needed to start the tough love part of the self care process and do things that were good for me even if I don&#39;t feel like it. I went to a zumba class. I didn&#39;t have fun. I didn&#39;t get an endorphin rush, but I got my heart rate up and I burned some calories even though I felt in a sour mood for being there. But I feel somewhat good about it and I think the control aspect is why...and maybe knowing that will keep me going. Thank you. </p>

My ex was uncertain about whether he even wanted children--I never had a pregnancy with him, and intimacy was an ongoing, ever-present issue aside. We ended up breaking up over this issue, as we wanted such different things. Did your husband want the baby you lost? If he was uncertain/ambivalent about it, I'd say to give your relationship solid consideration--wanting vastly different things can really affect and potentially end a relationship.

On the flip side of that, you committed to a partnership with your husband--you chose him, but choosing him is a daily commitment. If you're considering divorce, it seems perhaps this choice is becoming more difficult.

My husband had different ideas than me about TTC initially, and with the help of a grief counselor and many difficult conversations, we managed a compromise that we are both halfway-happy with now. Ultimately, my husband is my family, first and foremost--there is nobody else I'd rather go through life's joys and trials alongside. I will choose him even if we never become pregnant again--I would be incredibly sad about that reality, but I'll still choose him.

Try to have the difficult conversation about your future with your husband--does he envision having children? If so, how would that look without conceiving naturally, and are you able to compromise to adjust to his vision?

If you can't afford a therapist, I highly recommend reading [this book](https://www.amazon.com/Couple-Communication-After-Baby-Dies/dp/1883525039) with your husband--it provided my husband and I with a framework within which we could discuss our grief, and helped us wrap our minds around our miscarriage and how to move forward. Also, many employers offer an Employee Assistance Program, which offers counseling and advice on everything from finances to emotional struggles. EAP assistance is usually available to anyone living in your household, so check it out--you're already sort of paying for it if it's offered by either of your employers.

I will choose him even if we never become pregnant again--I would be incredibly sad about that reality, but I&#39;ll still choose him.</p>

<p>Try to have the difficult conversation about your future with your husband--does he envision having children? If so, how would that look without conceiving naturally, and are you able to compromise to adjust to his vision?</p>

<p>If you can&#39;t afford a therapist, I highly recommend reading <a href=""https://www.amazon.com/Couple-Communication-After-Baby-Dies/dp/1883525039"">this book</a> with your husband--it provided my husband and I with a framework within which we could discuss our grief, and helped us wrap our minds around our miscarriage and how to move forward. Also, many employers offer an Employee Assistance Program, which offers counseling and advice on everything from finances to emotional struggles. EAP assistance is usually available to anyone living in your household, so check it out--you&#39;re already sort of paying for it if it&#39;s offered by either of your employers.</p>

<p>I wish you and your husband health and healing through this difficult time.</p>

It's lovely. 

That being said - I posted the other day about how I had my first day back to work (which was on Friday) and how it was a lot for me. Well I worked yesterday too, and the emotions were still too much. So I decided to take today off as the guy I was due to work with today was ok with it. 

Well needless to say...my manager and I got into a fight. 

Quick back story - the store I work at is a small, independently owned store. My manager is not the owner. We've had a lot of people quit because of how she manages. We both get a long very well...but I don't always agree with how she manages or how she treats certain people. But she's always treated me with a lot of respect however I go above and beyond for her and the store & often get shit in return. 

Anyways, the fight was about me not being completely ready like I thought I would be. She told me that's why she had sent me the schedule before I came back, so I could review my hours in advance and let her know how I would be feeling. She said if I knew I wasn't going to be 100% I should have let her know so she could have hired someone during the holidays. That it's a busy time, and by me coming back and then deciding I'm not ready I'm inconveniencing them...and if I'm not going to be ready to work until after the holidays she needs to hire. That I should have known this was how I was going to feel, and it's unfair for those at work to have to pull 7 day straight shifts just because of me. 

Yet before coming back to work, she told me she was here for me. Anything I needed, she would accommodate. If work felt too much I just needed to let her know. Everyone else at work is being lovely, except her. I almost walked out yesterday and honestly....I'm considering quitting. She's going for surgery in January and I'm supposed to be running the store but at this point - I'm done  with her. I'm a certified eyelash extension tech so I can just do lashes at home for cash until I find another job 

I cannot believe her attitude. I don't just wake up in the morning and decide I'm going to ruin everyone's day and not want to work. Some days I am completely fine, others I am not. I have been trying to just go in and ignore all of the feelings but I can't. It may work for some, but it does not work for me.

Did your doctor tell you when you could try again? The only thing is my doctor had told me part of the reason to wait was that my tube would have been swollen and need time to heal, and if you try too soon it might be more likely to cause another ectopic. Again no definitive research, but that's what they told me.

So I feel like I can move past this just a little bit more and try and really enjoy our holidays. </p>

<p>I&#39;m currently finishing meds to get my period back again, then will be starting a combo of meds to shut my system down entirely, and then to build it up slowly so we can do a frozen embryo transfer probably late January. It&#39;s a long process, but I&#39;m actually really glad it will be partly over the holidays, because I&#39;ll have lots to keep me distracted. </p>

<p>The other thing I like is that I have a really clear timeline... nothing was worse for me than just waiting for weeks/month on end to ovulate, and having no idea when it might occur. At least now I can put TTC and babies out of my head until end of January. </p>

<p>So anyway, I&#39;m not around as much theses days, since life is so busy, but I think of you guys all the time. The worst club to be in, but the most incredible members.....</p>

We had a huge fight tonight, and we never fight. He left and I had a panic attack, which is not something I've ever dealt with besides after bad earthquakes. A check box on a form was ticked when it shouldn't have been (I didn't fill out that part of the form) and he overreacted so badly. 

I'm really mad at him, 50% for things he can't control, 50% because we never fight and it really freaked me out. I already have such confusing feelings about being pregnant, this is making it so much harder. I can't stop crying, I feel like such a child. 

He's not the type to admit he was in the wrong here, so I'm going to need to get over this myself. He will wake up tomorrow and expect me to be over it and then he will be mad when I'm not. 

In conclusion: I'm running away to a land where they let me be in an induced coma for the rest of this pregnancy so I can stop feeling sick, actually sleep, don't have to feel sciatica and wake up with a healthy baby who already sleeps through the night, you guys are invited.

I'm not trying to sound overly dramatic, it's just that I lost my faith in statistics and I feel I need to be reassured that being the 1% of people who have a miscarriage in the second trimester doesn't mean that all the 1% diseases and complications will happen to me.

So thank you so much for what you wrote, I've been rereading it many times for comfort.

I was spotting a couple of times in my first trimester and had my progesterone level checked once (it was normal), and I was put on oral progesterone called duphaston (even before the results came back). However, research from 2016 showed that it had no practical effects on keeping a pregnancy, and after talking to an OB/GYN I found out that it was only prescribed to women ""so that they feel safe"". At the moment I live in Poland (and many doctors still prescribe unnecessary antibiotics to please patients), and this drug is not common practice in Western Europe anymore.  I had terrible side effects and I had another spotting even despite taking it. So I was glad to stop when my placenta took over (progesterone production), I stopped spotting and felt much better.
Wondering if I would miscarry early otherwise. Which also points to a random chromosomal issue rather than anything wrong with me.

Yeah they didn't mention anything about my uterus. One gynecologist thought it was tilted, another one said no way. Pretty average uterus here I suppose :)

We had one good shot and it looks like it worked!  </p>

<p>I started <a href=""https://www.reddit.com/r/TFABLinePorn/comments/7hkzmt/undeniable_bfp_at_13dpo_then_fade_first_cycle_ttc/?st=JAWTIG74&amp;sh=fdad11f4"">testing</a> this past Saturday like a maniac, and was getting vvfp, faint pos, and next to nothing‚Äôs,   which had me thinking I was witnessing a CP in process. One day I was convinced there was something, and the next I was convincing myself not to get my hopes up. I‚Äôm thinking it was the brand of test strips I was using, as many people have been reviewing it poorly with similar issues. I convinced my guy to pick up a FRER, which gave me exactly the <a href=""https://www.reddit.com/r/TFABLinePorn/comments/7i32p6/frer_vs_eh_on_cd_35_and_first_attempt_after_mmc/?st=JAWTJXM3&amp;sh=be1f375a"">answer</a> we were looking for! </p>

<p>I‚Äôm hoping our Sweet Pea sticks around this time. Our first appointment is Dec. 28th, and my guess by then we‚Äôll be around 7w4d (considering a later than usual ovulation), even though it‚Äôll be 8wks according to LMP. We‚Äôre sharing the news with my immediate family on Christmas‚Äî I know they‚Äôll be so excited again. </p>

<p>Is it because he won&#39;t be able to get you into the office on actual CD1 or CD3 so you might need to be on the pills for a couple weeks until you can be seen?</p>

My brother's wife is in labor right now...on his birthday. With their 2nd. They don't know sex of the baby and I am sooo praying its a girl. We have 3 nieces and I was ""supposed to"" have the first male grandkid, but he didn't make it...and I'm days-weeks away from hopefully having THIS boy...I just want the opportunity to have the first boy, even if its ridiculous. Ahhhhh.

Yesterday my work threw me a surprise shower! So nice of them -- especially since I'm the new girl and started at 19 weeks pregnant (which they didn't know). I ""ruined"" the surprise, but only for myself, by guessing. lol  There was cake, fruit, cheese, chips, and PRESENTS. Woo. 

I've been struggling with my pain for weeks/months and now that I'm near the finish line its hard to keep it up. You'd think it'd be easier, knowing it will actually end soon, but...I don't know about that. Just feels like its been forever - I can barely remember not having sciatica and SPD. 

I see the OB today and with my hypertension I wonder before every appointment if this is the one they won't let me leave from. hah

*EDIT1* : it‚Äôs a NIECE. Yaaay. Happy and healthy. Due date baby who shares a birthday with her daddy. 

*EDIT2*:  So...I went to my regularly scheduled NST‚Ä¶ I am apparently having lots of contractions and the baby‚Äôs heart rate is fluctuating a lot. I‚Äôve been sent to the hospital for monitoring. Hmmm.

*edit3* were home. That was anticlimactic, annoying, and boring. Although a bit interesting and taught me to somewhat tell the difference between these crazy movements and contractions. I am definitely having contractions and apparently they sent me because of seeing some heart beat decelerations.  But I was monitored for 2+ hours and they didn't see that -- said everything is good.

It is so hard not to try to blame it on something. Like for me I had dental work, 2 crowns done, right before I found out I was pregnant. Then I had to wait 2 weeks to get the final crowns. As soon as I found out I was pregnant I switched to taking Tylenol for the pain, which was excruciating, and I had to do this every 4-6 hours for almost 2 solid weeks and then get the final crowns seated. 

I keep wishing I hadn‚Äôt done that, and thinking maybe if I hadn‚Äôt I‚Äôd still be pregnant now.

Not quite the same, but I can relate. I'm 100% estranged from my father, going on a glorious 11 years now. When I was younger, he was a meth-head and that was rough. He tried to kill my mother and I on multiple occasions. I was kidnapped a few times. Finally my mother got over her fear and left the bastard.

I got married and had my first LC all without his meddling.

We all know it doesn't make a difference when we want that baby inside of us so much. 

I told my partner I want to think of names once we've hit 12 weeks. When we find out the gender at the anatomy scan I want to choose its name and refer to it by that name.

It's so tricky because even if you're vocal about it some people just have no idea how to give support after a loss and don't care to learn how.

That said, even if people are awkward about it (my MIL) I still talk about it around her sometimes. I know it makes her uncomfortable but it's a part of us now and I can't pretend it's not.

It took us that long because insurance wouldn't pay until we had three 'official' miscarriages, and the first three were at home, with no testing or anything.

She has a paracentric inversion on chromosome 13. It's not apparent if that actually causes miscarriage though, as our latest loss at 16 weeks was chromosomally normal. There are some reports of families with paracentric inversions in 100s of relatives, but with no higher miscarriage rate, and no higher infertility rate. But, as no one has her particular inversion, then no one can really tell us.

The next step for us is 'microarray' which is looking at the chromosomes using some kind of specialized chip that can detect even smaller duplications or deletions. We don't anticipate anything new from this, but we figure we may as well get it.

The only chromosomal rearrangement that makes it *impossible* to have a healthy baby is a homologous robertsonian translocation, where both copies of a small chromosome have fused together. Even then, if your partner had the exact same issue, your miscarriage rate would actually be normal, but it's just so rare to begin with, the chance of having two people meet and fall in love is so slim. However, you can put this out of your mind. The X chromosome is not a chromosome that can combine in this way, as its quite large.

My surgeon for the appointment was amazing. I have not yet seen my regular OB (due to go today) but my surgeon answered a lot of questions for me. 

I was told bleeding is normal to last up to 2 weeks. After the first week bleeding can be irregular. That was my case. The day of the procedure I bled pretty heavily (a little heavier than a normal period) but it slowed down after about day 2, and was like a regular period. At about day 5 (when my normal periods usually end) it started to slow. However some days i would hardly bleed and then it would pick up. If I did too much walking around or lifting I would definitely flow heavier. My surgeon told me bleeding is only cause for concern if you bleed for longer than 2 weeks, soak a heavy absorbent pad in an hour for a span of 2 hours or pass multiple large clots (I only passed one large clot and that was it). 

I was told I could bathe right away if wanted, but I waited until my bleeding almost completely stopped as I didn't wanna deal with gross water. I opted to wear pads but was told I could wear tampons however they had to be changed super frequently. Just didn't wanna deal with that. 

As for sex, was told to wait at least 10 days to allow your cervix time to close and heal. My boyfriend and I had sex for the first time on my birthday (dec 2) which was 15 days from the procedure. 

My surgeon asked if  we were planning to try again or to wait. We said we wanted to try again so she wasn't going to go over birth control options. She did say t was possible to get pregnant within 2 weeks from the procedure. I had mentioned how a generic counsellor told us to wait at least 2 cycles but my surgeon said that's not necessary. Your body heals pretty quickly. They say to wait to make sure your hormones regulate but mostly so that they have a reference date to find out how far along you are but an ultrasound will confirm that. My surgeon never said anything about a pregnancy resulting in a miscarriage if you didn't wait 1-2 cycles. 

I see my regular OB today so I'm sure he will probably have other things to say, but at this point I'm letting nature run its course. Sex has not hurt, I don't have a foul odour or discoloured discharge (that would have been a warning sign of infection) and I overall physically feel well and on my way there emotionally.

In other news, my husband and I have an appointment with some important person on his base today to discuss the incompetence of the cemetery coordinator who keeps failing to order my son‚Äôs headstone. I‚Äôm a little anxious about it but keep reminding myself that this is one of the few things in my power that I can do to advocate for him now, and the worst thing that can happen is nothing‚Äî he already doesn‚Äôt have a headstone and the outcome can‚Äôt actually get worse than that at this point. My husband knows the woman we‚Äôll be meeting with so that helps, but his direct superior wasn‚Äôt excited that my husband and I insisted on this meeting to essentially complain about something that he just doesn‚Äôt understand, and that really burns me up. If his kid were buried there and he had been dicked around for seven months about the headstone he wouldn‚Äôt just be keeping his head down and hoping for the best‚Äî he‚Äôd be raising holy hell. 

UPDATE: the woman we met with today regarding our headstone was wonderful. She had really done her homework before the meeting and had met with both the head chaplain and the cemetery coordinator to a) find out what she could about the turns of events from the coordinator‚Äôs perspective and b) to figure out exactly what the process should look like. She discussed with us a few of the points at which miscommunications and errors had led to this situation and how they could improve upon it. She also informed us that our headstone should be installed by the end of the week, which was a surprise to both of us since we figured we still had about five weeks worth of waiting time based on the previous conversation my husband had with the VA representative he spoke with. My husband has also made it his mission to include a new guideline for this particular base regarding the death of dependents‚Äî families should be offered a casualty assistance officer who can walk them through systems like this with the headstone, or the mounds of paperwork my husband had to fill out to have his life insurance policy pay out our son‚Äôs death benefit. He brought this up with the woman we were speaking to, and she seemed to take it on board and said that was a reasonable request for these situations‚Äî someone who can dispassionately walk a grieving family through the red tape of a death. We pointed out that at this particular duty assignment, there are a great deal of young officers on their first non-deployable assignment. Logistically, this is just the time in a military career when people do things like get married and have babies, because they are actually in one place long enough to accomplish these milestones. We are not the first family to have lost a baby after 23 weeks gestation (which is the DOD‚Äôs classification of ‚Äúviability‚Äù for purposes of the death benefit payout per the service member‚Äôs life insurance policy) and we won‚Äôt be the last‚Äî just statistically given the size of the population of this particular base and general age range of the majority of the people staffing it, a late term loss will occur at least once a year. One of my husband‚Äôs co-workers lost twins at 24 weeks two years ago. I just heard of another family losing a micropreemie after several weeks in the NICU.

I‚Äôm a little anxious about it but keep reminding myself that this is one of the few things in my power that I can do to advocate for him now, and the worst thing that can happen is nothing‚Äî he already doesn‚Äôt have a headstone and the outcome can‚Äôt actually get worse than that at this point. My husband knows the woman we‚Äôll be meeting with so that helps, but his direct superior wasn‚Äôt excited that my husband and I insisted on this meeting to essentially complain about something that he just doesn‚Äôt understand, and that really burns me up. If his kid were buried there and he had been dicked around for seven months about the headstone he wouldn‚Äôt just be keeping his head down and hoping for the best‚Äî he‚Äôd be raising holy hell. </p>

<p>UPDATE: the woman we met with today regarding our headstone was wonderful. She had really done her homework before the meeting and had met with both the head chaplain and the cemetery coordinator to a) find out what she could about the turns of events from the coordinator‚Äôs perspective and b) to figure out exactly what the process should look like. She discussed with us a few of the points at which miscommunications and errors had led to this situation and how they could improve upon it. She also informed us that our headstone should be installed by the end of the week, which was a surprise to both of us since we figured we still had about five weeks worth of waiting time based on the previous conversation my husband had with the VA representative he spoke with. My husband has also made it his mission to include a new guideline for this particular base regarding the death of dependents‚Äî families should be offered a casualty assistance officer who can walk them through systems like this with the headstone, or the mounds of paperwork my husband had to fill out to have his life insurance policy pay out our son‚Äôs death benefit. He brought this up with the woman we were speaking to, and she seemed to take it on board and said that was a reasonable request for these situations‚Äî someone who can dispassionately walk a grieving family through the red tape of a death. We pointed out that at this particular duty assignment, there are a great deal of young officers on their first non-deployable assignment. Logistically, this is just the time in a military career when people do things like get married and have babies, because they are actually in one place long enough to accomplish these milestones. We are not the first family to have lost a baby after 23 weeks gestation (which is the DOD‚Äôs classification of ‚Äúviability‚Äù for purposes of the death benefit payout per the service member‚Äôs life insurance policy) and we won‚Äôt be the last‚Äî just statistically given the size of the population of this particular base and general age range of the majority of the people staffing it, a late term loss will occur at least once a year. One of my husband‚Äôs co-workers lost twins at 24 weeks two years ago. I just heard of another family losing a micropreemie after several weeks in the NICU. There‚Äôs a need for more assistance for families like ours here and I‚Äôm proud that part of our son‚Äôs legacy might be paving the way for making it easier for these future families to get affairs in order after the unthinkable happens to them.</p>

[TW: current pregnancy]

I waited for two periods, or three months. My first cycle returned about 32 days after my son's birth. Then we waited for one more before we tried on my third cycle, where we got lucky. Our pathology came back around 45 days after, and that did help cement the idea of trying sooner versus later (no significant results). 

Looking back, I have no regrets, but could have stood to have waited a few more months or longer. 3 months wasn't enough time for my body to heal properly, and I am feeling a lot of aches and pains much earlier than I did in the pregnancy that resulted in my LC (I am also 3 years older and into my third pregnancy). Though, our baby is healthy, and I am grateful and will endure without complaint for the sake of both the son I lost and the new life I'm growing.

Kind of useful information in my opinion. 

I wouldn't use birth control or anything, and if it happens even right after then it happens and I don't think there's anything dangerous about it - it's just more difficult to date because your cycle will probably be a bit abnormal for a while and you won't really know if you ovulated or not. A lot of people do ovulate a couple weeks after their D&C, but since yours was so late, I think it's more likely that won't happen. I'm not sure if I did - couldn't even take OPKs because HCG gives you false positives on the tests and I still had way too much HCG. And you may not have any sort of decent endometrium for implantation. Most likely you really do not, after a 16 week D&C, and it will just not be possible until after you start menstruating again. Some people purposefully wait it out some months after but I think more than 2 cycles is overkill. With an assisted cycle like I did, it was kind of more just a waste of time and money to jump back into it so quickly so I wouldn't recommend that anyway, I was stupid to try it again so fast. 

It is very important to get an ultrasound after the D&C to check for retained tissue and yes, you should request getting HCG levels checked because that can also indicate if you have some piece of retained tissue still pumping out HCG (can happen if they don't remove all of the placenta well enough). I had an ultrasound about a week after surgery that confirmed that things looked as they should (there was still swelling and fluid evident and a small amount of remaining tissue that was normal and they weren't concerned about it).

I had a D&C at 8 weeks for a blighted ovum. I don't know if advice differs for a D&C at 14-16 weeks. For my situation, I got only slightly varying advice from my regular gynecologist and the gynecological surgeon and I've summarized it for you: bleeding should last no more than 10 to 14 days, more physical activity can temporarily increase the bleeding (it did for me) but is nothing to worry about. No tampons, bathing, swimming or sex until the bleeding stops. Expect a normal period in 4 to 6 weeks (mine came at exactly my normal cycle length of 25 days, no more painful but slightly heavier than unusual), can use tampons again. Wait 1 to 2 periods before trying to conceive again. The gynecological surgeon clarified that not waiting at least 1 period risked another miscarriage because the uterine lining might be too thin. My gynecologist said doctors used to advise waiting 6 months but there's no need, she initially advised we use condoms for 2 months, but when I told her the surgeon said wait at least 1 cycle, she said 1 was fine and after that if it happens, it happens. I was told not to expect anything to come back from pathology as I had a straightforward blighted ovum, and I never did hear anything else.

For what it's worth, my sister-in-law had a D&C at 8 weeks and was told she could try again after 1 period and that is when she conceived my healthy little niece. From what else I've read on the internet, waiting 1 cycle is considered safe by most, and some doctors say you can try as soon as you stop bleeding, that makes dating the pregnancy difficult and stressful though. Also, your hormones are likely still settling before that first period, ovulation may not occur, OPKs may give weird results, etc. I read of some who conceived successfully before their first cycle, but I did read another story of such a pregnancy that ended in another miscarriage with the doctor suspecting the uterine lining had been too thin.

I've done nothing special other than allowing myself to grieve. I probably ""should"" be more physically active, but I'm cutting myself a lot of slack right now. I've taken my drugstore prenatals since two months before we started trying and figured it can't have hurt to continue them this whole time.

<p>Also, last night I felt alllll the wiggles. So, thanks for that baby. &lt;3 </p>

Yes, indeed. My wife and I have found it useful for dealing with her cycles, although they're pretty much fixed at this point. This helps us conceive fast, although it hasn't helped much with the miscarriage.

/r/famnnfp is a useful subreddit.

Just as a background, antiphospholipid syndrome is the most common treatable cause of recurrent loss. While it doesn't cause aneuploidy, it would cause recurrent loss. I think about 25% of women who've miscarried 3 normal pregnancies have been found to have it. Basically, it means you have antibodies against the outer layer of your cells (and the babies placenta). This causes the blood to clot, because the platelets get 'confused' and think they've been exposed to air. This can prevent oxygen reaching the placenta. It can also directly attack the baby. Luckily, heparin -- a blood thinner -- helps thin the blood *and* reduce the attack of the antibodies on the placenta. It's a straightforwards blood test, with an easy solution, so it's probably a good thing to ask for.

Other tests our doctor ran...

1. Prolactin -- lactation hormone. If it's high it will prevent implantation or cause miscarriage. Simple as that. That's one of its roles in the body -- to keep you from getting pregnant while breastfeeding. It could be high due to a growth in the pituitary or an auto-immune disease.

2. Anti-thyroid antibodies -- these are an independent risk factor for miscarriage. They can increase your risk, even if your thyroid is unaffected.

3. Anti-nuclear antibodies -- These are the lupus, sjogren, etc antibodies. Any auto-immune disease needs prope management during pregnancy or it could cause complications.

4. Uterine imaging -- any sort of uterine malformation can increase your risk of miscarriage. Usually, they do an MRI or a hysteroscopy, and some doctors think an ultrasound is good enough.

5. Post peak progesterone -- progesterone after ovulatino helps the baby implant. If it's low, you can supplement.",[],,t1_dqs4vkn,,0,,False,"<div class=""md""><blockquote>

It sounds like your doctor immediately went from PCOS to clomid (I could be wrong... just going off what I'm reading here). There's a lot in the middle. For example, oftentimes PCOS goes along with heightened insulin sensitivity, which can be tempered using metformin, a very low carb diet, or certain dietary supplements.

If you believe the issue is implantation and recurrent loss (which it sounds like it could be), then it would be worthwhile to be tested for anti-phospholipid syndrome. This causes implantation failure and pregnancy loss, and your risk would be heightened if others in your family had it. You can also ask to be tested for genetic thrombophilias such as factor V leiden, Prothrombin G20210A, Protein C/ Protein S deficiency, antithrombin deficiency, etc. 

You have a few possible losses based on symptoms and a longer cycle. It may be worthwhile to track your cycle using temperature and cervical mucus to determine ovulation. My wife and I have taught fertility awareness for three years. By itself, missing a period is not hugely predictive of pregnancy. However, ovulating and then not having a period for 21 days is a 99% certain indication of pregnancy. The key difference here is confirming ovulation.

Did anyone have a lot of reluctance about announcing their rainbow pregnancy? Last time we told family and close friends at 7-8 weeks after our first ultrasound. This time I just have a sense of dread about telling family in particular. I think it is partly because I'm still feeling crummy and too tired to deal with all of the questions and excitement that will follow an announcement. And also because I feel worried that everyone else will feel excited even though I'm not there yet, and I'll get upset because it will feel like they aren't acknowledging Daisy.

Pregnancy still doesn't feel real, but husband and I are cautiously hopeful!  Though, I had a bit of a weak moment yesterday where I considered sticking my totally-not-showing belly out to my husband while he was trying to get me to laugh by making funny faces and say, ""Look at daddy, he's such a clown.""

Anyway, this past Saturday was my sister's engagement party.  Her MOH sat at our table and since we didn't know each other all that well, she struck up conversation asking how my husband and I met, how he proposed, upon hearing that we like traveling she asked what places we liked to visit, etc.  When I mentioned that my husband got me engagement earrings instead of a ring, for some reason she saw fit to press the matter on whether my husband eventually got me an engagement ring, gesturing to my wedding band.  I told her no and explained that due to my work, a ring with stones sticking out of it would be a hindrance so I asked for earrings.  She still seemed perplexed that there was no engagement ring.

Not surprisingly she eventually asked about kids, though she phrased it as ""Do you have any children on the way?""  I really don't like this question because I never know how to answer since for all I know maybe I can never carry a baby to term.  It's also a triggering sort of question for me because I have a stalker-ish ex-friend who is obsessed with whether I am pregnant.  She doesn't know that of course, and since the question itself is generally considered pretty ""standard"", I just casually said, ""Nah.  No children on the way.""  She continued with, ""But do you want children?""  I decided to go with, ""I don't know, we'll see.""  She then turned to my husband and asked him, and he said, ""Well yes, I'd like to have children at some point.""  Which is true, but the whole interaction starting with the engagement ring was starting to piss me off.  I do admit that I might just be overreacting as I don't think she meant any malice in her questions, or simply firing up my defense mechanisms over our troubles with keeping a pregnancy...  but it was sure starting to feel like an interrogation!  Since my mom was there and she doesn't know about our losses either, I didn't want to say, ""We don't wish to discuss this topic"" and give my mom any suspicions as to what may (or may not) be going on.

I tried to derail the topic with, ""Maybe we'll just get a cat.  I mean, we won't have to pay for its college education, or pay to bail them out of jail.""  Husband then said, ""We could just leave them in jail and let them learn their lesson.""  I agreed.  The MOH seemed a bit uncertain how to continue, so husband further derailed the topic by asking whether she's next up to get married.  She gave vague, ""No, no, not my turn yet"" answers with my husband asking for clarification until she finally said she's not dating anyone yet.

Been discussing with husband about how we want to find out the sex. I think we're agreed that we'd want time to process, versus finding out at birth.

But, what about after? We said we would give it a few days to mull it over. My husband wants to do what we did with our LC (he surprised me with it) to try to bring some normalcy and excitement back to this pregnancy (and he says he has a really good idea he wants to use). But something he said has me rebelling against that idea pretty hard: he said he wanted to process the information alone so he could be strong for me when I find out the sex, versus both of us potentially being upset at once.

That seems unfair. My husband essentially wants to struggle by himself so he can protect me. All because he has a good idea. That makes it seem like he cares a great deal more about this than I do (I am sure I'll be upset either way, but I can see the pros in either sex and think I can get over it quickly). He won't really admit that he's struggling, and I'm not sure if he even knows the answer to that.

So I'm not really sure where to go from here. I dunno if it makes more sense to find out together in a potentially un-fun way so we can support each other, or let him do his surprise. I don't want to be upset at the news and it's taken like I don't like his surprise.

<p>The only way I found out though was by doing pre-conception consults. So at this point, maybe ask people you know who&#39;ve had losses about their doctors? I asked my support group leader to start. </p>

<p>I&#39;m also with you - I had a water birth with my first with intermittent monitoring and blah blah blah and if I ever get to birth a live baby again, I&#39;m like &quot;ALL THE INTERVENTIONS I JUST WANT A BABY.&quot; Ah, perspective. </p>

We‚Äôre spending our Blueberry savings on the surgery to have them removed. We should‚Äôve been buying onesies and painting our nursery.

Are you me? Lol

I get pregnant first try every time (I even got pregnant on birth control almost 10 years ago and miscarried).

Since September 2016 I‚Äôve had a chemical, a blighted ovum, and triploidy.

I had half my thyroid removed in 2015 because of a tumor. My levels were always in the normal range after, but my OB put me on a low dose of levothyroxine at the beginning of my triploid pregnancy because it ‚Äúcouldn‚Äôt hurt.‚Äù I‚Äôm still on it.

I have 2 fairly large fibroids and one huge one. It was about 11cm right before my current pregnancy. I actually went to the RE because of the fibroids and because my amazing OB wanted to see if there were any other answers he could find.

The first visit with the RE was a little awkward. I‚Äôm definitely not the typical RE patient. I explained that I just wanted a hysterectomy and that a baby would be a nice bonus. We talked about how easily I get pregnant (the doctor gave off a little bit or a ‚Äúwhy are you here?‚Äù vibe) and what we already knew about the causes of my miscarriages.

In the end, he decided just to rule out the fibroids as a contributing factor, since the miscarriages didn‚Äôt appear to be related. I came back for a sonohysterogram the day before I ovulated, and he said the fibroids wouldn‚Äôt cause any issues. The official diagnosis was ‚Äúshit luck.‚Äù He offered early ultrasounds every 2 weeks from 6-12 weeks. He said to call him the next time I got a positive test, and I said, ‚ÄúI‚Äôll call you in two weeks!‚Äù

When I called back (2 weeks later, just like I said), they had a difficult time scheduling ultrasounds for me when I wasn‚Äôt working. I ended up not going back. It didn‚Äôt feel like I was a priority to them, and I get that. My regular OB offered me as many ultrasounds as I wanted, but I was pretty meh about it. I had one early one and have just been on their normal schedule since then.

Now I‚Äôm 15 weeks, and everything has been normal so far. So I think ‚Äúshit luck‚Äù was a good diagnosis. We‚Äôll see.

If I were you, I‚Äôd go in with as much info as you have (my RE didn‚Äôt have the genetic testing results from the triploid pregnancy yet, even though I knew them) and a list of questions. The first visit for me was just talking and developing a plan. Have an idea of what you do and don‚Äôt want to pursue (for me IVF was 100% off the table) and what tests you want to push for. Good luck!

It's tremendously helpful for me. I've gone through something very similar.

It was my first pregnancy and when I started feeling better last Thursday - no nausea, no anger at smokers - I was very happy. I went to the gym for a half an hour run on Sunday  and just kept running faster and faster because of how good it made me feel.

I had some slight spotting the next day, I attributed it to the running but booked a visit with a OBGYN on Tuesday just in case. He was very nice and said everything was most likely fine, and went out of his way to book me a USG the same day. A favour for a crazy pregnant lady, thought I.

To the two present gynecologists' and my surprise, the USG showed no heartbeat, no movement, and general swelling of my fetus. It had probably been dead for some time before I went to the gym. I was told to go to a hospital and not eat or drink for 12h the night before. 

Wednesday morning I was admitted to a hospital (confirming USG) where I got misoprostol vaginally and told not to eat or drink and wait for the labor. (everyone has been super nice and understanding) Since it was my first pregnancy the doctors wanted my cervix to dilate on its own, in order to minimize the risk of incompetent cervix in the future. But nothing happened, no pain, no cramps, no labor.
I did, however, pass a 8cm clot. And bled some.  

They tried again about 12h later with 2 pills per rectum (i could apply the pills myself). On Thursday morning they examined me (cervix dilated 1cm) and put 4 pills deeper in with a forceps. I waited till Friday midday, but nothing happened. Waiting was exhausting. Not eating was exhausting, but probably helped with not having diarrhea or nausea after misoprostol. 

Eventually they decided to perform a D&C. By that time my belly was almost the size from before my pregnancy, and the uterus contained a mass of tissues that once was my baby. I was scared of all the possible complications ( I'm working in the medical field myself and realise that sometimes it's neither up to the patients body nor up to how good the doctor is, complications happen.).

The procedure went fine and fast. I got propofol IV and an oxygen mask, so I dozed off quickly, didn't dream, and woke up waiting for the D&C to start while it was already over. According to my husband it only took about 15 minutes in total.

I was given a couple of doses of antibiotics (cefuroxym IV) and a prescription (cefuroxym tabl), and stayed the night. Still no cramps, no pain, some bleeding but not much. One 8cm clot. 

It was an emotionally wrenching experience, and it makes me feel older. I'm balancing between different stages of grief and reading through this forum and other sources helps a lot. It helps especially to know that I'm not alone in my pain and shock, and that there's a chance for me in the future. My husband has been wonderful, and our bond has got even tighter.

Our doctor told us to wait 3 months before trying to conceive again, but after some research I think we'll start trying earlier. Either when I'm off pelvic rest or after my first menstruation.

I'm looking for information on when we can start trying again, (assuming we first come to terms with our loss) considering that it was an early second trimester miscarriage.

So... we are starting to look more seriously at adoption. I have always loved the idea of adoption and wanted to do it even before all the losses. (Three and counting). 

So starting to research it this week made me temporarily excited. 

Until, I entered the dark dark world of babies being kidnapped, sold to orphanages for profit who turn around and sell the child to foreigners who desperately want children for even more of a profit. 

Ughhhhh. Ugly cry for those parents. And the kids. I don‚Äôt want anything to do with that ‚Äúbusiness‚Äù that encourages more kids being stolen from their homes. 

We have looked at fostering here in the US to adopt; and I am not against it entirely. But it would have some serious drawbacks for our family: 1) while some kids are up for adoption eventually, the majority are rightly reunited with their bio families. Not sure I can handle more loss or how I would even begin to explain to our two year old the revolving door of playmates / siblings coming into his life and leaving. 2) I am really bad at the newborn stage. I mean I can handle it if I know the end is near but to hand me a newborn then I get him or her to functional 3 month + stage, then they take him or her away and hand me another newborn. Well.... that really is the recipe for me being a horrible mother and wife and person in general. So I am not sure fostering is right for us at the moment. Maybe when son is older. 

I have always wanted to adopt from China. I lived there for two years after college. My sister in law also married a Chinese man. So we have family living in China. If we adopted a Chinese child I would try to keep them connected to their culture as much as possible, even sending them for summers there so they can feel connected. China is only allowing for older children and special needs children to be adopted at the moment. This is a good thing. It means Chinese couples are adopting more and more and fewer healthy infants being abandoned. But then I am all ‚Äúam I crazy for asking for a special needs orphan who will no doubt have huge wounds from their life in an orphanage and may need tons of health care?‚Äù I mean we have some money but not like hundreds of thousands of dollars. And of course if we had a bio child have medical expenses we would figure it out. So then I feel guilty for even thinking of that. But the truth is having a special needs child (bio or adopted or whatever) IS really hard on a marriage and are we strong enough to willingly sign up for that? 

If we do ultimately decide to adopt, I also am having a tough time finding local agencies that aren‚Äôt religious. You have to sign their statements of faith to adopt from them. While I am a heterosexual Christian, I am very liberal and don‚Äôt feel comfortable going with an agency that won‚Äôt let my LGBTQ friends or my atheist friends also adopt from them.

I had my NT scan this morning and the ultrasound looked perfect. MFM doc was very happy. They drew blood for the PAPP-A screener and I should have those results within a week.

I‚Äôm really glad and relieved to have gotten good news at the ultrasound so for today, I‚Äôm feeling good about this pregnancy.

We‚Äôve had a tough week emotionally. My son is buried at a military cemetery attached to the base where my husband is currently stationed. We are entitled to a headstone from the VA, and it‚Äôs been ‚Äúin the works‚Äù for six months. Turns out the cemetery coordinator just keeps dicking my husband around and never properly contacted the VA with the approval she was required to give for the text of the headstone. This is the third time my husband has been told it‚Äôs been ordered, and the previous two times it obviously wasn‚Äôt ordered, so we are naturally skeptical this time. Not having a headstone there is a giant piece of closure that we are missing out on, for no good reason other than that this lady has completely failed to do her job. (She also, two months after Sam died, asked my husband, ‚Äúyou‚Äôre all better now aren‚Äôt you?‚Äù Wtf. She should not be working with grieving families.) We are requesting a meeting with someone with some authority because this is pretty unacceptable, not only for us but for every family that has to go through this woman to get their loved one buried and recognized. 

Also, my parents still do a stupid Christmas letter every year and my dad recently sent out the call for what we want included. Ummm. What? Do we have to do this this year? I responded and asked to just be left out of it, thinking that my parents would realize how hard a Christmas letter detailing my year would be and would decide to just skip it. Instead my dad responded with a draft that included newsy updates about what my 3 year old has accomplished this year but didn‚Äôt mention Sam at all. This was also unacceptable, so I had to call them and explain that I wanted to be left out because it was unimaginable to me that we would write a Christmas letter that didn‚Äôt include the most significant event of my year/life, but it was equally unimaginable that news of my stillbirth would be delivered to their mailing list alongside cheery news about my new baby nephew and my other nephews‚Äô soccer tournaments and my niece‚Äôs ballet class. It just didn‚Äôt compute for me. They eventually agreed but conceded it would be ‚Äúawkward‚Äù when they received questions about why my family wasn‚Äôt in the letter this year. I had no sympathy for that argument because every day of my life is awkward right now but I still have to go to the dentist and answer that I had a boy but he was stillborn and then lie there with my mouth open after sharing that news.

I lost my twins at twenty weeks too in last August, and it is everything you said for a long, long time. I thought everything you said above and hated everyone, mostly myself. Losing the girls robbed me of not just them but so many things. It‚Äôs not fucking fair. 

I mean it was is at least a solid four months of gut wrenching pain. 

One thing I tried to tell myself was that my girls wouldn‚Äôt want me to destroy myself and if it was reversed where I was dying , I wouldn‚Äôt want them to destroy themselves over my loss.

So be kind and self care. 

Don‚Äôt go to any Christmas event you don‚Äôt want to, actually don‚Äôt go to any. You officially are given a fast pass out of dealing with people. 

Indulge in mindless tv. My favorite is RuPaul because theres never kids and Real Housewives New York or Beverly Hills. Atlanta and Jeresy and OC have too many younger kids. Oh and  Vanderpump Rules! Theres a whole culture around these shows that you engage with like on reddit where you can talk to someone about something without talking about kids. I think thats really important too, Reddit‚Äôs  RuPaul and Real Housewives threads subbed saved my life because they let my mind think of something besides the horror show my life was. 

Use grocery delivery services if your area has those to plan healthier meals. Do yoga from youtube. If people want to help, let them bring food. 

Tell your friends to tell you when to avoid the news. Beyonce and Armeil Clooney both were super pregnant with twins and that was a nasty trigger. 

If you have to go out, listen to podcasts on your headphones. 

Every time  you tell someone about it, start with ‚ÄúRight now the only acceptable thing to say is sorry‚Äù and if they start saying platitudes like ‚Äúwell at least you know you can have..‚Äù shut them down. Trust me on this. It will feel really, really good.

But most importantly we love you and Asher, and we are always be here for you. üíï

I had a loss at 20 weeks, though never got to meet my child and had a D&E, so we have different experiences. A year and a half out, I will give you my experience in case it helps. 

This just happened to you. A month ago. I am much further out and still grapple with how much it impacted me. It has definitely become a foundational pillar in my personhood, like a load bearing beam in a house. You don't get me without my loss. Those first months are hard. You are being asked to bear this unbearable pain, that is ripping you apart cell by cell. I couldn't eat, I started smoking and drinking. I cried all the time. I remember one time sitting outside on a lovely day, drinking lovely wine with lovely friends and thinking ""I'm never going to be happy again. I am going to be nothing but sad forever. My god.""

At some point, I was able to laugh again, without guilt. Just a little. Then more and more. Then I was able to have my baby be the second thing I thought of in the morning, some mornings. Then the third. I still think of my baby every day, but not waking up crying before I even open my eyes. I think my baby would want me to be happy, I would want them to see me and think ""see that happy put together woman? That's my mom"". You are good enough to be a mother, and this wasn't your fault. In no way was this your fault. 

At some point, my loss became something that was a part of me, but not the entirety of my entire being. Because where you are at, right now, it is everything. How can it not be? I don't want to say that time heals, but time helps. You don't heal, you don't go back, but you evolve. And we are here to help you evolve into a person that can live a good life while having this loss become a part of you. 

Sorry for the novel. I get especially sad seeing losses around my time, it is such a weird in between place. Not quite a miscarriage, not quite a full stillborn, it is no man's land. Feel free to PM if you have any questions.

I get lost in it, I focus on it constantly during the moments when I can&#39;t affect the outcome, I panic and rage and cry. </p>

<p>The choice I have to make is whether to take a calmer, less active approach, i.e. continue to track temps to confirm ovulation but no OPKs, no forced sex marathons, no &#39;extras&#39; (I was using Robitussin around O date last time to help). Or to go all-out. Either way I want to do it in an accepting, calm fashion, if that&#39;s even possible. I&#39;ve ordered OPKs even though I already have some in the house, so I know what my autopilot mode is...</p>

Background: initially when I realized the pregnancy was going downhill I went to the hospital and between two betas and an ultrasound I was officially diagnosed as having a blighted ovum and was referred to an early pregnancy loss clinic who followed my blood work as time went on.  I bled for about 2 weeks and my hCG had dropped significantly so they told me the worst was over and my levels would just take a while to taper off. 6 weeks later, I started spotting and then ‚Äògot my period for real‚Äô- I found my original post about the weirdness of it and it‚Äôs here:

‚ÄúTMI alert- crazy period 
I'm on day 10 (not including 3 days of spotting) of my first period post-MC and there is no end in sight. Started as spotting, then got super heavy- tapering off at around day 6/7 which I thought would be the end of it. Woke up on day 8 to actually having stuff in my pad from overnight (which hardly ever happens) but nothing through the day. Woke up on day 9 to a lot in my pad from overnight and a lot through the day. It's like my period re-started from the top and CD 8/9 acted more like a typical 1/2. Today is day 10 and I'm now down to a more 'medium' level of flow. WTF is going on here??

The plan was to NTNP this cycle, but I'm getting close to when I would typically ovulate and I can't see how anything could even happen with what's going on up there...

Did anyone else have a crazy period afterwards??‚Äù 

... see how similar it seems?  After day 10 it tapered off more, but then kicked right back up again to a medium-ish flow for a third time. It continued to ‚Äòpulse‚Äô with shorter and shorter intervals like this until I was basically only bleeding at night/ early morning and by lunch time I wouldn‚Äôt have even needed a liner or anything. 

By the third ‚Äòpulse‚Äô the cramps started to get more significant rather than just normal period cramps. It got to the point where the pain was making me catch my breath/ gasp/ make a face when a cramp hit... but then just kept getting  worse. By day 16 (I think) it was to the point that I was being woken up from a dead sleep at 4-5am bleeding and in excruciating pain needing Tylenol and a heat pad, almost going to the hospital... but it only lasted for an hour or so before it tapered enough I could get back in bed. By coffee break at work I was feeling fine...  

Obv saw my dr as soon as the pain got really bad/ with two weeks of bleeding. She thought it was endometritis (inflammation/ infection, not endometriosis the abnormal growth) and gave me antibiotics and booked me for an ultrasound. U/S was on day 21, and I was told that my scans looked the same as the ones the hospital had done about 10 weeks prior- no change. (That mentally broke me, all of this was for nothing). Since I didn‚Äôt have bleeding for so long in between they actually assumed it was a second pregnancy, but my betas has been negative since day 3 or something of this crazy cycle. The day after I talked to the early pregnancy loss clinic about the game plan and made it clear I was NOT taking the drugs- I had had enough cramping and bleeding thanks... so they found me an OB who would do a D&C on a 6 week BO and I was on call to the OR the next day. So with spotting pre-CD1 I had 26 days of confusing biological torment before it had to be  surgically fixed. 

On the plus side I felt fan-freaking-tastic after the procedure since my uterus didn‚Äôt have anything left in it to throw a fit over. Got a real period about a week and a half later and I *think* my cycle is back on track now...

<p>I just want the time to go faster, and it&#39;s a struggle to feel present in each moment. I sobbed a bit last night, because lately I&#39;ve been feeling lonely when I go to bed--my husband is a night owl so we have an elaborate tucking-in ritual he does each night, then he goes and surfs the internet or plays video games for a few hours after I go to sleep. I didn&#39;t mind so much when I was pregnant, because I was never alone--I had our little Blueberry to keep me company. Now I just feel so lonely at night without him in our bed. Our cats are sleeping with us now, and that helps some, but I still want my human family with me at night. I miss being pregnant; I miss my husband, even when he&#39;s just in the next room.</p>

<p>This is so hard.</p>

I was very scared of the MTX and depressed about the waiting part. The actual MTX wasn't that bad. I did not have bad side effects from the drug- some headaches and light sensitivity about 2-5 days after, and just felt kinda blech on days 2-3, but not enough that I couldn't function normally or anything like that. The worst part for me was that it takes so gd long to resolve, at least for me (and I think it takes 3-4 weeks even in best case scenario). Everyone is very different in this respect though. Some people have minimal bleeding. I had gushes of blood (watery, not thick like normal AF, so hard to contain...) and largish clots starting maybe a week or so after the shot and continuing like every 2-3 days, with just spotting in between. I would have bad cramps for maybe an hour or two after a gush, but not otherwise. This lasted for like 4-5 weeks. Then it transitioned into normal AF type bleeding, then stopped, and I had a regular cycle. The unpredictable gushy bleeding was terrible, especially because you are supposed to wear pads. 

But I don't think this is necessarily typical of a tubal ectopic. Mine was suspected interstitial and there was a lot of fluid/what would be a subchorionic hematoma in a regular pregnancy on ultrasound.  So I had a lot of extra blood to come out.

Also, you have to get regular blood draws. Mine were weekly until it was <200, then every other week until <10. My highest was I think 4800 on day 4 after the shot-- it will often rise between day 1 and 4, then should be dropping on day 7 or you will get a second shot. I am now about 9.5 weeks from day of shot and blood draw on Monday was 6, so I am done with those finally. 

They told me yesterday to wait until I had one normal cycle before trying again. Since I just got AF from what felt like a normalish cycle, I am trying again. Maybe they would technically say wait one more, but f__ that. I'm ready. I did some google research and the MTX doesn't really stay in your system that long, I'm starting prenatals again today and I feel comfortable with my decision. I don't get pregnant easily anyway, or maybe I'd wait one more. 

The MTX is mostly really hard emotionally, because it takes so long to work and for your hcg to return to normal. It's like a slow motion miscarriage. I often found myself jealous of those who could have a D&C and just rip that bandaid off and move on, though I think it's probably a grass is always greener kind of thing.
