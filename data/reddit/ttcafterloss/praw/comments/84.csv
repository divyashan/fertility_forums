This is a hard question to answer.  I try to look at the positives and what I can control.  More because when I look at the negatives and what I cannot change I find myself having depression and mental health issues.  I look at it that I still have my health and can try again. I worried that because I'm over 30 that it would be harder to have a baby.  My first pregnancy was a chemical pregnancy (On August 10th) and then I got pregnant before I got a period and MC (October 28).  While I was pregnant my coworker announced his wife was pregnant and I would have been on the same week as her if I didn't lose my CP.  I look at that there is a new life on the way and even if it isn't from me that is still a beautiful thing.  I won't lie that I had a glass of wine each night for a week after my miscarriage. I'm now accepting what happened and trying to move onto what I can do. Take Qoq10, eat right (I'm doing keto to lose the pregnancy weight from my MC).  

On another post, someone wrote something that really stuck with me.  These feelings are not jealousy.  It is grief. You are not just grieving the loss of the baby but the loss of a possible future. This is an extremely difficult thing to accept and you are allowed to grieve.  You probably had birthdays and trips you wanted to do with your future baby and the MC is a loss of that future. I've come to acceptance at the loss of that future and it helps me face other pregnant women.  I'm still grieving and it still hurts.  I'm very A-type and tend to focus on what I can do/change and helping me grieve is to take control of something. I won't lie that it still stings a bit but it isn't their fault or even mine.  Take the time to grieve properly and if you need to then speak with a therapist.  If you cannot afford a therapist then there are therapy apps where you can be connected to a therapist to talk.

What also helped me is that we told people early.  Not having to hide our loss was able to let people be empathetic to us and give us the space we need.  I was also able to talk with a surprising amount of people face to face that also experienced loss.

Over in r/infertility, it’s pretty common to hear that IVF can be diagnostic. Many, many people go into IVF as “unexplained”, and then learn major things about their infertility...so it’s not actually unexplained at all. 

It’s possible that there’s an egg quality or sperm quality issue that isn’t preventing fertilization and implantation, but is preventing proper embryo/fetal development. 

Some things to think about...Has your partner had an SA and DNA fragmentation done? Have you and your partner done karyotyping?

I took another MIRA this AM at 4AM before headed back to airport for work conference and it said “low”.  But my pregmate said positive. 🤷🏻‍♀️

Is MIRA more accurate than pregmate?

It isn&#39;t helping that his libido is extremely high. He gets pleasure from pleasuring me, so usually when I tell him I&#39;m not going to climax he&#39;ll back off. I still have times I cry out of no where, so he sees the pain is still raw. 
Thank you for the lovely words. 🤗🤗</p>

<p>It happened to me too. 7.5 weeks and 6 weeks right after one another.  I’m a young (27) healthy white woman and it was just bad luck as far as we can tell. Your age and ethnicity probably has nothing to do with it - loss effects a lot of us. I do have one living child who is almost 2yo. After the holidays I’ll be having a few more blood tests done to rule out anything obvious but then we will start trying again. </p>

After MC #3 we went ahead with a freeze-all IVF cycle with PGS testing to identify chromosomally abnormal embryos, then resumed trying naturally. I was very needle phobic but actually managed to do all my own injections. The cycle is definitely kind of intense in terms of time (doctor almost every other day, time off for retrieval, feeling ""off"" throughout), but I was back to normal within a few days of the retrieval despite having mild OHSS. We did go on to to transfer an embryo later, and since I have regular cycles my RE let me do a natural cycle FET. There was considerably less monitoring- I went in a total of 3 times, did OPKs at home, and only had a trigger shot. After ovulation I started vaginal progesterone the same as I had with my other pregnancies. 

I would ask your RE what you might gain if you chose fertility treatments. Would IUI possibly benefit you, or are you more in the ""get pregnant but don't have success"" category?

<p>After MC #3 we went ahead with a freeze-all IVF cycle with PGS testing to identify chromosomally abnormal embryos, then resumed trying naturally. I was very needle phobic but actually managed to do all my own injections. The cycle is definitely kind of intense in terms of time (doctor almost every other day, time off for retrieval, feeling &quot;off&quot; throughout), but I was back to normal within a few days of the retrieval despite having mild OHSS. We did go on to to transfer an embryo later, and since I have regular cycles my RE let me do a natural cycle FET. There was considerably less monitoring- I went in a total of 3 times, did OPKs at home, and only had a trigger shot. After ovulation I started vaginal progesterone the same as I had with my other pregnancies. </p>

<p>I would ask your RE what you might gain if you chose fertility treatments. Would IUI possibly benefit you, or are you more in the &quot;get pregnant but don&#39;t have success&quot; category? If so, IVF with PGS might be more appropriate. I&#39;m happy to chat more about why we did IVF if you want to message me. Best of luck to you!</p>

We are just taking a break to heal and get a period and then we are going to try again in a few months.</p>

I had an intensive HIV/AIDS phobia for about 3 years in my early 20s. It started after my then boyfriend cheated on me during our relationship and spiraled into years of me getting myself tested every 2 months or so, going to therapy for a contamination OCD problem. 

It stemmed from two things. 1) it took the place of me grieving the loss of my relationship at the time. Instead of missing my asshole of a boyfriend I focused on this new problem religiously. It overrode any grief I had from the breakup. 2) even then several years ago all I wanted was to be a wife and mom and I believed that if I contracted HIV that would take that opportunity away from me. So my greatest fear was having that disease and being unable to have my family one day. My psychiatrist said that HIV is a favorite of people to fret over because it is elusive, scandalous, traumatic and depicted as ruining people's lives. It's the perfect thing to ruminate over and over. 

&#x200B;

It is actually pretty difficult to acquire HIV. The virus itself is weak unless you were injecting drugs, sleeping with someone who had it, etc. you are highly unlikely to get it.

  
As far as making your husband/unborn child sick.. you are tested twice in pregnancy for HIV. At that time they can begin to take precautions for exposure. But you will know at that time that you are negative. I thought when I first became pregnant how fearful I would be of getting my tests done. It actually didn't happen that way. By that time I had kicked the OCD fear and was able to see things clearly. 

&#x200B;

In my opinion, I'm sure you're replacing some of your grief, loss, worry, etc. over the loss of your sweet baby and focusing on HIV instead of your worries about TTC and having a healthy baby some day.

Not really looking for responses, just a place to let my story and heartache out. 

My husband (37 now) and I (35 now) married three years ago and I had my IUD removed pretty quickly. We casually tried for about 7 months and then started tracking ovulation and really tried for another few months before I asked my OB for tests. It became apparent quickly we were dealing with tubal factor infertility as both of mine had hydrosalpinges. My tubes were removed and we moved straight to IVF where our first cycle was cancelled due to poor response. My second cycle we were able to get 5 embryos and opted not to have them tested due to cost and we just wanted the ability to try with all of them. 

Our first fresh transfer of one embryo failed to implant. That sucked. We did a frozen transfer with two embryos and ended with a chemical pregnancy. That sucked even more. Our last attempt with our lay two embryos resulted in a singleton. We saw the perfect little heartbeat at 6.5w and then a moving blob at 9.5w. We transferred care from the fertility clinic to my OB and we were so excited. It finally worked on our last try! We were going to be parents! Our NIPT results came back low risk. Each OB appointment they found the heartbeat quickly and it sounded good and strong. 

When my AFP results came back slightly elevated, they referred me to a perinatologist to evaluate for possible spina bifida. I knew in my heart my child didn’t have an ONTD so while I worried slightly about the 20w ultrasound, I felt pretty positive. Nothing could have prepared us for the news we were about the receive. Baby’s kidneys were not developing properly and were severely dilated and multicystic. There was almost no amniotic fluid in the sac since baby wasn’t producing urine. The perinatologist let us know the condition was fatal and baby likely wouldn’t make it to birth. The baby we struggled through infertility to get wasn’t even going to have a chance at life. Ouch. 

Last week we made the incredibly difficult decision to TFMR via a D&E. To say the following days have been difficult is an understatement. Never have we experienced love and loss like this before and what makes it 100x worse is this is the end of our journey to parenthood.

You don't have to wait before trying again, but it might not be a bad idea to wait out one full cycle and give your body time to reset itself. In the meantime, focus on eating and sleeping as well as possible, taking your vitamins and just generally prioritising your physical and mental health. Miscarriages make the whole process of TTC incredibly stressful and draining, and you need to prioritise a bit of self care so you don't lose yourself in it all.

It sucks :( First off, everything you said sounds completely normal for what you are going through.  I feel like a madwoman every single day too.

I have done a crazy-madwoman-level of research into miscarriages now (science is one of my coping mechanisms).  And here is what I have learned.  It is unlikely that you are having bad luck. That can be both good and bad news.  The science shows us in women who have had 2 or more subsequent miscarriages, about 7% of those are due to chromosomal issues.  And then remember of that 7%, about half is male factor.  New research is telling us sperm DNA fragmentation (not tested with usual sperm tests) is a bigger factor than previously thought.  They are karyotyping you and not your husband because the medical industry is full of mostly men and it is flat out sexist and wrong on so many levels it makes me crazy!  If your dr believes chromosomes could be an issue, both of you should be tested.

On the question of if it's worth trying again before your appointment - that one only you can answer.  If you feel up to trying again and you feel like you can take it if it's another miscarriage, then it's worth it to try.  If you feel like one more would just kill you, then it might be prudent to wait until you have more answers before moving forward.  And please know that with proper testing and a treatment protocol, there is a whole lot of hope for you and for people like us that have had 3+ miscarriages.  You can most likely have another baby if you want it.  It just might take some work and some extra digging, extra tests, but it can happen!

Some carrier diseases do cause miscarriages.  From what I understand about fragile x, you don't sound like a candidate for that because you had 2 MCs before you had your son.  I believe women who have it, have a son easily, then have trouble afterward.  And from what I understand CF and SMA don't specifically lead to miscarriages, just your child might have the disease if both you and your husband have it.  

You're not crazy for thinking about this and worrying about it.  If you are interested in what tests could give you some answers, I recommend the book ""Is your body baby friendly?"" by Dr. Alan Beer.  (I think it's a stupid title for the book, but the book itself is really great).  Dr. Beer goes over all the diagnostic tests he recommends for his patients.  He was a reproductive immunologist, and the first in his field.  He believed, and did research to prove, that many recurrent miscarriages can be caused by the immune system.

It is also completely normal to obsess and think about other issues like birth defects, etc because once you have been through something traumatic that is supposed to be ""rare"", then you start to wonder what other rare horrors could you experience next.  It is 100% normal.  

Maybe your psychologist isn't a perfect fit for you but more importantly, no one...and I mean \*no one\* can fix this for you.  It sucks and it's horrible and not even the most skilled and qualified person in the world can take away all the grief that you feel.  It's something you have a to move through and it's messy.

I’m not too close to any of those three, but that brings my tally to seven March/April 2020 pregnancies in my circles (with two being super close friends who are sending me bump updates on the regular). I don’t know anyone with due dates between this past summer and February. The last close friend I had who had a baby was in 2017, so this is a huge uptick for my social circles.  I know it’s just random luck, but I’m just feeling so many complicated feelings.</p>

These changes were specific to my situation. I had short cycles and spotting, so she suspected I was estrogen-dominant. I also eat very little processed food and use sea salt instead of iodized salt, so we added a natural form of iodine to compensate for what I wasn’t getting through my diet.

That would also mean I had an 11 day LP versus 13, but that’s in line with my average and 11 days is sufficient and I honestly don’t know wtf it was before, just that I got pregnant from sex on CD16.

I had a fertility discussion appointment with my doctor. She made a point to review what's happened to date (trying since Jan, pregnant in April, miscarriage in May, no luck since), and acknowledged how that sucks. Then she walked me through the four things she thinks about when thinking about why her patients may not be conceiving: not ovulating, tube blockages, uterine issues, or semen quality. We talked about the likelihood of the first three, which she said was low. She said the likelihood of poor semen quality is low because we got pregnant and my husband's health / age (good, 34).   


She told me that we're still under the year mark (yep), and that the likelihood is that I'll get pregnant in the next few months (because math and my history). She did say that ""because of my age"" (32), it often takes couples a year and a half to conceive. I hadn't heard that before, but I appreciated the reality check from her perspective.   


All that aside, she said the thing that made me hopeful, ""But of course, this is your decision about if you'd like to do testing now. It's up to you. My hunch is everything will come back normal, and if it does, we can talk about next steps."" She also heard my concern about cost and coded the lab order as ""history of miscarriage"" instead of ""infertility"" and said the insurance was more likely to accept that, given my history. And then she walked me through everything she was ordering and bid me adieu.   


It felt so good for her to validate what I was already doing--timing sex, tracking ovulation with OPKs and temping (which she didn't dismiss!) --and tell me I was in the driver's seat. Hot damn.   


One thing she did mention that I wanted to pass on--she recommended having sex up to three days after ovulation. We usually stop the day of ovulation (we're usually pretty tired at that point). 

Anyway, I'm hopeful. I hope that lasts. And I hope I can lend some hope to others here. And I guess I'm grateful, too. That feels good.",[],,t1_f4wupxo,False,0,[],False,"<div class=""md""><p>TEAM, I am hopeful today and that is a joy in itself.   </p>

Haven’t tested HCG at home, my doctor hasn’t done an ultrasound yet, but I do have a follow up on the 28th. I bled for a few days past a week and then in tapered off, thought I was done, started taking baby Asprin and went back to work yesterday, and started bleeding again. It’s dark and not a lot, but I’m super frustrated.

I suppose that&#39;s a good thing... let&#39;s us know that we don&#39;t have to do everything perfectly (although you best believe I&#39;ll try lol).  </p>

<p>I&#39;m sorry for your loss and I hope that you can allow yourself to relax more next time. &lt;3</p>

I miscarried at 9 weeks in late August/early September, and ended up conceiving before having another period. Unfortunately it ended up being a CP (or possibly ectopic, I'm being observed by my doctor), but here's what I learned:

* Ovulation predictors also detect HCG, so you'll get false-positive OPKs until your HCG is at or close to zero.
* Depending on how high your HCG was when you miscarried, it may very well still be in your system next week, which doesn't mean anything is wrong. The fastest it can drop in your blood is 50% every 24-36 hours, but it's also common to take longer than that. My doctor told me 20% every 48 hours is their bar for minimum expected decrease.
* Most (but not all) people have their next period 4-6 weeks after a miscarriage, meaning they may ovulate somewhere around 2-4 weeks, but it's also possible to have an anovulatory cycle.
* You CAN ovulate and have a period with HCG still in your system. I don't have hard numbers from when I ovulated, but I was still getting strong positives on Pregmate strips and never actually got a negative test before conceiving again. Based on how my betas line up with my HPTs, I'd guess my HCG was (very roughly) in the 50-100 range.

I was very anxious about losing time and wanted to try again as soon as possible, but I have to say that tracking the HCG downward and then spending weeks agonizing over ambiguous results was very rough on me emotionally. Part of me definitely wishes I'd waited at least until the HPTs were negative before trying again, but, that's the benefit of hindsight I guess.

And who’s to say they haven’t had a loss in the past?  I lost my son in 2016 and while I think of him daily, I’ve complained of lesser things with my subsequent pregnancies.  I just have the empathy to know when to keep it to myself.</p>

I know that’s not everybody and it’s stupid to be envious of anyone here - were all in the same crappy boat and have all been through hell. I just really want to start trying again, and it’s killing me.</p>

<p>I know my doctor was trying to help, but eff that. I’m peeing on all of the things (multiple flavors of pregnancy tests and opks) and temping because what else am I supposed to do with my time in this quiet, childless house.</p>

I read somewhere that you can ovulate as long as your hcg is below 100, but can&#39;t find citations/studies to support that. Ovulation predictors don&#39;t work for me this month since hcg and LH are chemically so similar the tests can&#39;t differentiate-- I took at least one per week, and they have been positive all month long.  No idea when to expect my period and no idea if I&#39;ve ovulated (CM which I usually use to tell, is also all over the place and strange (for me)). However, my breasts are still very sore (uncharacteristically), and I still feel bloated. No period cramps yet, though.  Just wanted to share for comparison/help.</p>
