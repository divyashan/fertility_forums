But in reality both options suck and I&#39;m sorry you in a position where you have to have either.</p>

I had no symptoms that my body was going to MC on its own. That alone made my decision for me... I wanted to be done with the miscarriage ASAP so I could try to move on with my life, and I didn't want to take time off work (it's the first week of the new year!) so I opted for misoprostol/Cytotec. It's unfortunately not foolproof and some people need a D&C anyway, and for some people, it doesn't work at all. I'm not sure this makes any medical sense, but in my head, I thought that forcing my body to go through the physical miscarriage might be good in the long-run, almost like it's teaching my body what it *should* have done.

I think everyone's reaction to miso is different, and it depends on how big the fetus/sac is - for me, the sac was 7w. I took the miso at 3pm and an hour later I took a Percoset (my doctor prescribed this for pain), which I kept up with for a full 24 hours because I didn't know what to expect. Around 5:15 the first wave of nausea and ""contractions"" started, and even with the pain medication, it was still an 8 or 9 on the pain scale and lasted about an hour. No bleeding yet. The second wave started around 8 and lasted until 9:30pm and I ended up vomiting. I had cold sweats and chills. Between that, I felt normal and after the second wave I felt normal again, and that was it as far as pain, but only very little blood. I highly recommend a heating pad and a heated blanket during this time and have someone around to bring you things/rub your back/comfort you. I was totally fine Saturday and could've worked my desk job if I needed to. However, I was very nauseous for days and I actually didn't start passing the bigger clots everyone talks about until 40 hours later (Sunday morning 4am). I was fine all of Sunday, then got nauseous again all day Monday and passed more clots Tuesday morning (2am). I think I kept passing clots in the middle of the night because I was sleeping with a heating pad.

I do have some insight from my cycle since I found out about my MMC on the Dec 12. I was supposed to be about 9w and was pregnant with 2 babies that had stopped growing around 6 and 7 weeks. I chose to do the medication route which ended up working for me. When I went in for my ultrasound the day of finding out I was having a mmc my hcg was 4250, so it was low for where I should have been so my body was recognizing there was no longer growth. I went back in 1 week later with hcg to 58 (I took the medicine the evening of Dec 12) and then 15 days after that (Jan 2) it was at 2, which is considered negative. I counted Dec 13, first day of bleeding as CD 1. Between Dec 12 and Dec 19 I tested OPK and hcg everyday. OPK was showing positive and peak but I read that it can pick up hcg which was still in my system clearly. They got lighter as I kept testing and hcg test lines became lighter. I got what I feel is a real peak on Jan 1, CD 21, the day before my last blood draw. I also had watery cm and high soft open cervix position for about 4-5 days. I was using OPK and Mira to test my urine. I believe I ovulated but I do not temp so I don’t have confirmation. We tried during my fertile window and hit everyday. I want this badly!

So, I’m actually the opposite. 
With my first pregnancy, I followed all the “rules”. I ate healthy. Drank only water. Cut out all caffeine. Walked a mile a day. Etc, etc. I ended up having a MMC.

I thought exactly like you. I wanted to get pregnant again, but I dreaded getting pregnant again. Every time I imagined someone saying ""congrats"" I just started crying because so many people said that, and then there was nothing to congratulate me about.

So I don't know how it's going to be for you. But for me, getting past the point where I lost the  other one was a big step. I know there are still a ton of things that can happen, and yeah I worry about those things too. But I'm not doomed to repeat the same exact thing again. 

We still did our best not to get our hopes up or get too attached early in the process. We told our parents at 12w, we haven't told anyone else yet. We decided not to find out the gender with the NIPT results, because making things more specific makes you more attached, you start imagining a boy or a girl instead of a generic ""baby"", you start picking out names, etc. And for the most part I try not to dwell on being pregnant. 

But at a certain point, you kind of can't help but be excited, even an old curmudgeon like me. You see it moving on the ultrasound, you're going to feel something about that. And if you want to lean into the excitement, that's ok! You can still have a fun announcement, maybe you'll feel better if it's a different kind of announcement than what you were planning last time. You can choose not to be sad about it. 

It hurts because you put yourself out there, to love something that you ended up losing. And it was easy to do last time because you didn't think you would lose it. But that doesn't mean you shouldn't put yourself out there again; but it does require extra bravery.

With your pregnancy her husband still has a baby to look forward to while the wife does not (she still does but not as directly) so for her it feels like she is going through the grieving process alone.

Rather than giving her space have the husband or your addressed how devastated you are as well? Have you or he cried or been held by her?

I was told to wait a year because my son was delivered via cesarean. The doctor said he felt better if we waited a year so I could heal fully, internally. My husband took it pretty literally. If it had been up to me, we would have already been trying again a few months ago.

Find out what things she definitely wants to be involved in and what things she might need to be a bit removed from or need to find a better way to manage things.

In that respect they are the same

A CP happens when there is no chance for clinical evidence such as a gestational sac to be seen.  Chemical evidence, HCG, is all there is - and not a whole lot of it usually.  Typically you should be able to see a sac at about 5 weeks on a viable pregnancy.

There are wide variances and I have experienced them :). I had a CP once where my HCG was 15 at 15dpo and I bled the next day.  I had a CP once where it was faint one day and I bled the next (14dpo).   I had one just last week where I had very strong positive tests at 13 and 14dpo, but levelled off at 16dpo w a beta of 30, and I started full flow 19dpo (so a 4w5d loss).  

Chemicals are annoying and crappy.  If you are above a certain HCG and time, (approx 5 weeks and a gestational sac) that's a ""clinical miscarriage"".   The best thing about them is, if a pregnancy is not going to work, it's easier on your body and maybe your mind when it happens that soon.   For me, a clinical loss has a far deeper emotional impact than a chemical one.

I'm so so sorry. It's all so horrible and unfair. I would ask your care provider what their cut off is. The hospital I went to, the cut off between D&C/D&E was 14 weeks. After 15 weeks there was the choice of induced delivery. It's super screwed up, but it seems like the long waits for D&E are pretty common; I was told it was a 5-day wait. I had a meltdown when I heard that.

I took time off after my loss. I had complications after my delivery, and due to grief I had a really hard time functioning so I quit my job.

I am so sorry for you that I don't even have words. 

I also had a TFMR in June of this year at 21 weeks and 5 days, but my son was born alive and kicking. 

Before that I had an early 1st trimester loss. 

I'm 36 now. The TFMR was due to very severe spina bifida which is also a neural tube defect as I'm sure you are more than aware. 

I wanted baby Lincoln more than I can even articulate. I fucking love him and if I didn't have 1 living child I would very likely be dead. The grief is so heavy. 

I pray to the gods I don't believe in that I am still able to carry a healthy baby. 

I am only saying these things because almost no one in my actual life can identify or understand but unfortunately other women like you can. 

I am sorry for Forrest. Just like my Lincoln. I'm also sorry that your entire idea of what the future was supposed to look like has now come crashing down. I'm sorry you may have no one that understands or acknowledges what you have to go through. This is pure fucking tragedy. 

I know it's too soon for you to hear this but there will still be meaning, purpose and happiness in life. It is worth being alive. 

No one can predict what the future holds but it is likely to be happy. 

But right now, if it feels like the darkness and grief is swallowing you, you have permission to deal with it anyway that helps you as long as you hold on. 

What you have been through is unspeakable and tragic. Take time. 

I hate when people say ""sending you so much love"" but as a fellow human being and a woman who has had to go through this I want you to know my heart goes out to you. You can reach out to me anytime.

First, major congrats on your success -- that is huge. You hit the nail on the head with everything you said and we have so much in common! I'm basically searching for anecdata because I'm concerned we're following the recipe for heartache because we're choosing the less significant time/financial commitment, and I think my RE's hands-off approach in which she's totally fine with that makes it harder for me to say we should bite the bullet with IVF. I should have mentioned I did carrier screening and was negative for the 25 or 30 major inherited conditions tested, so my RE did say with IUI + injectables we get a roughly 25% chance each cycle, but with IVF + PGT to ensure euploidy that would be closer to 60-70%. I think I'm having a hard time rationalizing that 1. even though we technically can have some success with IUI, we can't optimize those parameters any further so IVF may be the best choice, and 2. the 30-40% chance of IVF still not working seems **huge** to me when I consider that it is truly 20X the cost of an IUI cycle. I keep thinking that surely if we just tend to create a greater number of aneuploid embryos, the rationale for that would be reflected in one of our numbers, like me having a lower AMH or husband having morphology < 4%. But that doesn't seem to be the case. 

It also seems unlikely that Invocell/effortless IVF would be a good option for us because fertilization doesn't seem to be the issue -- the PGT part is really what we would need to shift the parameters a bit more in our favor, and my understanding is that is not available with Invocell. I know a common perspective is you make the decision to move to the big guns when the trauma of not having success outweighs the trauma of the IVF process/costs, and I think I'm basically circling that neighborhood so your comments are helpful. 

Again, thank you so much for your response and for the vitamins/supplements you detailed to prep for IVF.

Discovered only 7 follicles and 4 are blocked by a cyst. Not good. So 3 working follicles every month to drop 1 good egg. They can’t remove the cyst without damaging my right ovary so that’s not an option right now. The cyst is benign.</p>

<p><em>The good news</em> 
- I’ve got great hormone levels for my age 41; they are basically the same as avg 35 yr old. 
- I’ve got 9 frozen eggs from when I was 35 
- My Insurance will cover 1 round of IVF. 
- I ovulate monthly and have regular periods</p>

<p><em>The bad news</em>
- the likelyhood of me getting pregnant naturally is less than 2% 
- I’m 41, so egg quality is probably not ideal
- I might have to find an egg donor</p>

I'll be honest. I'm still sad. And everytime I hear about a family member have a baby or i see my nieces or nephews I still get a pang in my heart. But I embrace that feeling ( because its valid ) and then I allow it to pass. And then i try to feel happy for the good news and celebrations.

So we went from just getting on board with the idea of getting pregnant (of course we have thought about it for a long time - we have been together 14 years and married 10, it’s just taken us this long to feel ready) to actually being pregnant and being 100% all in to finding out we lost the baby to having a D&amp;C in a span of 6 weeks. I feel like I have whiplash from the rollercoaster of life changes and emotions. We will probably try again in the next couple of months but I’m feeling both exactly like I was before - emotionally guarded in case it doesn’t happen immediately - but with the complicated feelings that come from what I’ve just been through.</p>

Seed Cycling

Proov tests proved my progesterone was a little low, so I’m seed cycling and using OTC progesterone cream

It’s funny, this entire time while I’ve been playing the waiting game, I told myself I would prefer to do it naturally than opt for a d&c if it came to that, but you may have convinced me otherwise.

My next ultrasound is scheduled on Thursday when I’ll be 10w on the dot. If I make it to then I think I’ll ask to schedule it at this point. I am so sick of waiting and waiting and waiting!

I’m not sure what seed cycling is? I’ll have to look into it, but regardless I’m glad you’re feeling back to normal. I didn’t take blood work when I wasn’t pregnant and I’m genuinely curious about my endocrine levels specifically, I know my progesterone was much lower than the range so maybe it’s something I can ask to monitor... I don’t really even know where to begin after this ordeal. It’s definitely a learning process. Right now I’m feeling cautiously optimistic, but to be fair I guess we have no other choice if we really want pregnancy to happen.

I did intensive research and had a lot of bloodwork done on Cycle 3, (CD3 bloodwork, CD21 Progesterone test), we started on supplements like CoQ10, NAC, R-Ala, Vitamins C, D, E. and Pregnositol. I bought Proov strips to test Progesterone. I’m seed cycling this Cycle, and using progesterone cream. I bought TempDrop, fertility cookbooks, and doing acupuncture. 
Hubby got SA tested too. 

Im on Cycle 4 and my body seems back to itself. The same thing happened to one of my best friends a few months before me and they got pregnant again on Cycle 4. She’s 16 weeks now. Baby 2 for her, I’m still trying for 1. 

So sorry... it does get better with time. Sadness comes and goes, some days are better than others. 

1 in 4 pregnancies end in MC. It’s very common. I had 4 bridesmaids (of 10) tell they had them as well after I had mine. I had no idea they had also gone through this. They all have kids now.

If I have a semi regular cycle now post weight loss then that could change things.</p>

Here’s a story if you’re interested.
My best friend got pregnant with a person she had actively been planning to break up with. They were high school lovers and had a lot of history, but she constantly talked about how unsatisfied she was etc. I actually really like the guy as a person, but totally see how they don’t exactly match up. She was 5.5 weeks pregnant and casually made the announcement on FB like “hey guys heads up I’m pregnant lol” after texted me “hey don’t freak out but I’m pregnant”. Literally the day before this I was sending her links to tiny apartments she could afford on her own. So when I brought up to her “what about the breakup planning” + why people wait until the 2nd trimester to announce + it seems like you might want to think this through all the way before throwing it out in to the world?... we ended up not speaking for several months. Rewind to a few months before that interaction, I had herbally induced a miscarriage, which I didn’t want to do - but more like had to do. She threw my situation out there in the heat of her rage about how she would have supported me if I had my baby and I should be doing the same for her. It made my head spin and I don’t think I’ve ever hurt that deeply in my entire life. Inducing a miscarriage was the most emotionally fucked up I’ve ever felt in my life and to add this on top of it... man. Anyway, her FB announcement was beyond annoying and she didn’t even make a big deal out of it - so you partner’s cousin’s sounds like ultimate cringe.

That was the only appointment I had with her before and at that time we already knew she was very sick and unlikely to survive. The therapist was a specialist in the pregnancy and loss related field. She was amazing and actually visited me in the hospital sometime after they took our daughter away. She helped me in that moment.

There are so many things and feelings I’ll never forget from that experience. She passed away January 2017 so almost 3 years ago. I still remember her smell, how she felt in my arms, how much she weighed. With time these memories don’t destroy you when they come up. Healing from this isn’t easy. Dealing with this alone is too much to ask of anyone. So please find the strength for your daughter and for yourself to call and make an appointment with a therapist. 

Talking to others will always be a little awkward and hard. They don’t want to hurt you. They want to avoid hurting you. They obviously know that you are hurting. Tell them honestly how you feel. Tell them that you need them to listen to you talk about her. Tell them that it is ok (or not, depends on you) to mention your daughter, other people’s pregnancies or whichever topic you think they may avoid.  It is ok to tell them straightforward “look. I know it’s a hard topic. I want to talk about her. I need to. It helps me heal and move on.” 

Somethings that may help you get through this could be music and reading. Remember to be kind to yourself. Don’t force yourself to do anything because you or others think “you should be over this” that’s a gigantic stinking load of bullshit. 

[this reddit comment is pretty great to explain grief](https://www.good.is/articles/best-comment-ever) and this quote is one of my favorites 

>Grief, I’ve learned, is really just love. It’s all the love you want to give, but cannot. All that unspent love gathers up in the corners of your eyes, the lump in your throat, and in that hollow part of your chest. Grief is just love with no place to go.
Jamie Anderson

My therapist gave me a (granted tiny) list of songs that deal with the loss of a child. I’m not going to lie, these are still triggering to me. But it’s a good cry, I hope you know what I mean. But all of these artists have experienced the loss of a baby. But seriously these if you’re not up to listen to these, save the list for later

Somethings not Right - Lily Allen (about her stillborn son)

Still - Gerrit Hofsink (about his stillborn grandson)

I will carry you - Selah (they had an incompatible with life diagnosis and chose to continue with the pregnancy until the end)

I went through the tough parts, pregnancy and birth, but don’t get to have my daughter. But that doesn’t mean she has to stay a secret.</p>

I didn’t get it. So I’m drinking a class of wine while I still can. Long story short... I’m sorry.</p>

It is truly a nightmare that is unimaginable until you're actually in it.  Almost 3 months ago I chose to TFMR at 19 weeks for a diagnosis that was similar to spina bifida.  My son's genetic test came back at 17 weeks with an increased risk for it, and we found out at the scan with the MFM specialists that he had a severely deformed spine, along with an open abdominal cavity and other anomalies.  He had lethal defects with no chance of surgery, but I also couldn't imagine putting my newborn through years and years of painful surgeries if they had been an option.  It turned out to not be SB, but even if that had been the cause we would have made the same decision.  This is a heartbreaking decision to make, but it does come from a place of love.  You love your child enough to spare them from so much pain and suffering, so please try not to hate yourself.

In the end it comes to how you see life going forward for your child.  I have a friend who has SB, but it wasn't severe and he has a pretty ordinary quality of life.  I'm sure his parents had plenty of hard times when he was young though.  Every case is different though, and important to get as much information as possible so you don't overreact to initial results that aren't as bad as you originally thought, or on the other hand get your judgement clouded by the ""miracle baby pulled through"" story when your own case is worse than theirs was.  

If you haven't already, I recommend speaking to a genetic counselor.  They will be able to guide you through your diagnosis and its level of severity.  If you do choose termination, know that you are not alone.  There is a wonderful support group, you can find it on the website, [Ending a Wanted Pregnancy](https://endingawantedpregnancy.com/).  They also have a section on the site for people who have not yet made the decision, and it's very helpful.

It's something for only you and your husband to decide, with the help of medical advice you get.  The waiting time between initially becoming aware of the problem and getting more information will probably be some of the longest time of your life.

Do you recommend getting betas done for a CP? If so, walk in labcorp ($39)or at an ob? I have a high deductible heath plan so worried it’ll be expensive at regular ob. I’ll give them a call today when they open I guess.

We didn't get the NIPT for our son but his post-mortum testing showed nothing. He was perfect. It's bullshit. I had a cytocec induction at 18 weeks (measuring 16w). It's a bunch of waiting, like 12 hours worth. Most boring 12 hours of my life. And then you're in full-blown labor. I have been in full-term labor twice and it's exactly the same, it just isn't as long. I highly recommend the epidural; I got one towards the end and I barely felt the delivery and managed to sleep up until then. I hated morphine and fentanyl, but they should be able to offer you pretty much anything you want to try. Get everything they offer- prints, hair, photos, blankets, hats. Even if you never look at it again, you don't get another chance to get those things. We weren't able to get any hair or prints at 16w and we didn't take photos. Hold him if you'd like, but don't feel guilty if you don't. I couldn't manage it and 3 years later I don't really regret the decision; I was told his body wasn't in good condition and I wanted to remember the perfect baby I saw. Get them to print any U/S photos they've taken; my OB stored them all but it was a PITA to get them several months later when I was better.

Be prepared that your milk may come in and decide what you want to do. I donated but I know that's extremely hard to do. I had all the equipment already and I really liked having something positive to focus on.

I’ve learned a couple things about grief and being able to move forward with someone who doesn’t seem to have the same grief as you throughout this whole process. 

The first thing I’ve learned is that everybody grieves differently. 

The second thing I’ve learned is that everybody empathizes differently. I was mad at my husband for a while for not understanding why I felt like I couldn’t get out of bed in the morning. 

At the end of the day, you both when through very different things... together. And that can be a hard thing to navigate. 

Here’s how I made it better (and this isn’t to say it’s the right way but to solely share my experience)... I stopped caring what my husband would think about me for feeling the way I did. I owned it. I was sad, and that was ok. Once I understood this, I did everything I could to get help. I made an appointment with a therapist. I made an appointment with a doctor and decided I want to try medication to deal with depression that already existed before I was pregnant and was made worse by the loss. Then what really helped after that was coming on here and sharing my story. Opening up to people who could truly empathize, because even if our stories aren’t exactly the same we all know what that heartache feels like. Groups like this allowed me to not feel so alone. 

All in all, once I started heal a little bit I used that as a step to get the help I so desperately needed. Until then remember that this sadness doesn’t define you as a person and as hard as it is to see right now... it will get better. 

It sounds like your husband is trying to help as well but maybe doesn’t know the best way to go about it. He sees you sad and is frustrated that he can’t make it all better.

Like, holy shit woman! Is that really the most sensitive thing you could think of?</p>

<p>I already struggling with feeling like I have to prove myself to my parents and disappointing people is a big emotional minefield for me.</p>

<p>Now I feel like this process is about them. They’re just excited to know that my husband and I are trying.</p>

<p>Just fuck . Fuck. Fuck. Fuck. She’s texting me today and I’m ignoring her.</p>

I feel like I had no interest in sex ed as a teenager (so embarrassing! lol), but explaining how it REALLY works early and often would make people less clueless.

I&#39;ve noticed that as we&#39;ve been TTC and tracking everything, I&#39;m more in the mood around ovulation (more incentive yes, but also the hormones are meant to make you more turned on), so that&#39;s probably what happened with your sister, unbeknownst to her.  I feel like I had no interest in sex ed as a teenager (so embarrassing! lol), but explaining how it REALLY works early and often would make people less clueless.

Maybe you'll surprise yourself and be mostly ok. Its so hard to know. And if anyone, ANYONE, like your MIL or BIL or husband tries to make you feel bad for not being 100% totally happy, just remind them it isn't about her, its about you, and your pain is just as real and present as her joy.

In hindsight, I wish I spent a little less time with my hugely pregnant sister in law while I was grieving, because now I see I was putting way to much on myself with trying to &quot;return to normal&quot; and &quot;not make waves&quot;</p>

<p>&#x200B;</p>

<p>MIL told me yesterday that &quot;She&#39;s huge already! Wait until you see her belly&quot; </p>

<p>UGH come on MIL. Mine said insensitive stuff too and I still hurt or cringe a little thinking about it. </p>

<p>&#x200B;</p>

<p>So my advice is, I guess, just... do whatever you feel you need to do in the moment. Give your spouse a heads up that hey, you may need to sneak away to cry. Hey, you may ask to leave early. Maybe you&#39;ll surprise yourself and be mostly ok. Its so hard to know. And if anyone, ANYONE, like your MIL or BIL or husband tries to make you feel bad for not being 100% totally happy, just remind them it isn&#39;t about her, its about you, and your pain is just as real and present as her joy. And it deserves to be acknowledged.</p>

I miscarried my first pregnancy at 12 weeks last month which, sucked. Then a few weeks later ON MY BIRTHDAY my brother in law who is engaged said he and his fiance are 20 weeks pregnant and due a month before I would have been.


Now, I don't have it all figured out on how to cope, and of course everyone is different. A couple things though I have found that help (so far) is to share my pain and what I am going through with people that I know and trust or people that understand (e.g. reddit). I am sure if i kept it to myself and tried to deal with it that way the pain would fester. I felt angry at them and the universe and while it has subsided a bit, I still feel a little angry. It feels unfair- my husband and I are the ones with a empty 4 bedroom house and they...suck. whatever!


I still have hope that it will happen for us, so I am focusing on my journey and next steps and healing (#selfcare) and trying my best to ignore them. When i start to think about it I try to shut it down because no good can come of it.  I know that being angry at them only brings more toxicity my way so I just do my best to not even talk or think about them which, is easy to say and do now before the baby shower and baby delivery.
