My husband and I have been through a TFMR loss--for CHD and other issues related to a genetic issue. When I got my son's final diagnosis, I felt so devastated and so robbed. If you want the [many, many] details (and the kind responses from other TFMR moms) you can read my intro post [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/ttcafterloss/comments/80qsbb/intro_our_2nd_trimester_loss_and_moving_forward/). 

After my loss, reading other people's stories helped me a lot.  [Ending a Wanted Pregnancy](https://endingawantedpregnancy.com/)  had a lot of helpful material (and they have a private Facebook support group). 

Our hospital gave us  [*A Time to Decide A Time to Heal*](https://www.amazon.com/Time-Decide-Heal-Difficult-Decisions/dp/1878526391), and our library had [*The Prenatal Bombshell*](https://www.amazon.com/Prenatal-Bombshell-Continuing-Pregnancy-Diagnosis-ebook/dp/B00Y2A3JXE). Both are helpful, non-judgmental guides for navigating this type of loss. The former is a short quick read that my husband and I did together. The latter is a more detailed book that covers everything including TFMR, perinatal hospice, having a child with disabilities, and what comes after these things.  

Our hospital also connected us with a bereavement counselor who we/I saw monthly (free) for nearly half a year after our loss.  Our hospital offers support for ""anticipatory grief""--i.e. when a child's prognosis is not good, but the child has not yet passed.  We didn't find out in time to take advantage of this, but you could ask your genetic counselor if they can refer you for similar support.  We've also gone regularly to a parent support group for general perinatal loss. (The closest one specifically for TFMR is 2 hrs away from us, but you might live closer to one.)

I had the same feelings of detachment from the baby for a couple days after we learned our son might have serious health issues.  It was a difficult two weeks to wait for the amnio results.  However, after a few days in, I decided that if two weeks was all the time left I was going to get with him, I wanted to make the most of it.  We had good meals, ""took"" baby for a hike in one of our favorite local parks, enjoyed his kicks...made memories.  And in the months after he died, it helped that we did that--now, when a milestone comes up, we have places we can go and things we can do to feel closer to him.   It's not for everyone, but it worked well for us.  

I also understand the instinct to not tell family what happened.  Not a lot of people knew we were expecting, so we didn't tell a lot of people about our loss.  But we *were* open about the circumstances to the people we *did* tell, and everyone was sympathetic/supportive.  Everyone's family/social circle is different, though, so you're the best judge of who you can trust with your story.

The TTCAL alumni aren't super active on this thread these days.   Most check in over at /r/pregnancyafterloss.  I think there are 3 of us TFMR moms over there, and a few others who've been supportive of me even though their losses weren't TFMR's, if you need more support/advice.

I hope you and your husband take care of yourselves and each other this coming week. <3",[],,t1_e2gc9vb,False,0,[],False,"<div class=""md""><p>Oh! I&#39;m so sorry you&#39;re in this position.  My heart goes out to you.</p>

You are not overreacting. I have historically done my best to grant a LOT of grace to people in my circles who have done or said the wrong thing because before my loss, I just had no idea what to say to people when they had a negative event occur, so it’s easy to understand that other people can be socially inept when trying to interact with the bereaved. But it’s like your fam isn’t really even trying. Also, your cousin’s husband asking you, apropos of nothing, if you blame yourself? Just. Fuck that. I don’t have any other words for him beyond that.

After our son’s funeral, my husband’s family just went completely dark. Since they didn’t know what to say to us, they chose to say nothing rather than to clumsily find ways to try reaching out to their son. It was devastating for my husband— we aren’t close with them, but they are still his parents and he was hurt. It has further eroded our relationship with them. My husband’s frustration and anger with their reaction has resulted in several conversations over the past 14 months in which he feels he must coach them through their grief and remind them that his is ongoing, even if it is not exactly fresh. These conversations haven’t been terribly fruitful— despite his coaching, my husband’s family did not reach out to him in any way on our son’s birthday, so he wound up having yet another emotionally taxing phone call to explain that our dead son is not just something we can sweep under the rug and forget. I have no real advice for you, only commiseration. It’s so rough when you’re already working so much harder than you should to take care of yourself, but then those who should be supporting you and lifting you up make you feel even worse.

my advice is to cut these terrible people out of your life. they don’t seem care about your grief or your feelings and i wouldn’t waste one ounce of time or energy on them. you have much more important things to do right now, like taking care of yourself.

hold onto those that make you feel comfortable and loved and respected - it sounds like your parents and a few close friends will be there for you. sometimes one or two people who truly get it holds way more worth than having a giant support system with duds in it.

But like you, I'd be somewhat uncomfortable of shitty coverage for 6 months while TTCAL.  

One option is to see if leaving your current job and losing your current coverage counts as an open-enrollment exception.  

I.e. Typically if a spouse losses their job/coverage, it counts as an exception and they don't have to wait until November to enroll.  I once had a contract end in October, and was going to have a coverage gap.  My husband was able to add me to his plan right away--he did it a few weeks before my contract ended.  So we didn't have to wait until January for my coverage to kick in--it kicked in as soon as my contract/coverage ended.  

A job change might trigger a similar exception.  His HR department should be able to tell him pretty easily, along with the monthly premium for a spouse, if he can't find the details for his benefit online.  

(Technically, I think you have a window...e.g. 30 days after the job ends?...to enroll...and as long as you do that, coverage is retroactive for the time between the end of the job and the date you enrolled.  But that would involved more billing/insurance hassle, so better to sort it out ahead of time.)

It won't solve the ""TTC while starting a new job"" issue, or the ""should we wait 3 months so I'm guaranteed full maternity benefits when I deliver"" issue.

So, I have one living child and we've been trying since January 2017 for #2.  I've had three miscarriages, one at 12 weeks and the rest around 8 weeks. I thought one maybe two miscarriages was just within the stats, but after the third one, I decided something must be wrong as I was able to carry my first pregnancy to term with no major complications. 

I've had Hashimoto's disease which is an autoimmune disorder against the thyroid. It's been well managed for a very long time. Even though my GP and my endocrinologist said that my Hashimoto's had nothing to do with the losses, it just didn't feel right to me. When I had my first miscarriage at 12 weeks, I had already seen a strong heart beat and I had had NIPT done and I know the fetus did not have any trisomies (of course that doesn't discount any other genetic disorders that aren't screened by NIPT). The other thing, was the one pregnancy that lasted until 12 weeks, I was on steroids in early pregnancy. The second miscarriage didn't last long enough to see it on the ultrasound, but the third miscarriage, there was definitely a heartbeat. Anyways, because of my history, I had a feeling it was going to lean more to an auto-immune problem.

There are several REs in my area, but I picked one specifically who looks at possible immune issues for RPL as I've read on local forums that some clinics don't treat for them. My RE did an HSG, thrombophilia panel, karyotype, and carrier screen. The first two are available through LabCorp and the last one was through Counsyl. The thrombophilia panel showed some elevated cardiolipin antibodies and slightly decreased Protein S, but they weren't off the charts. She also took some blood from me and my partner and sent it off to a lab at Rosalind Franklin University because I don't think these are standard labs that LabCorp or Quest run. It showed I have elevated Natural Killer cells and I have increased cytokines (indicating some sort of inflammation). This test also showed I have high ANA (not as high as yours). The tests also showed that the NK cells that I have are responsive to IVIg treatment. These tests also looked at some genotypes between me and my partner. I apparently express a receptor that could potentially cross react with a gene product if my partner passes it to the embryo (alloimmune). While I think the alloimmune issue could partially explain the losses, I feel like since it's a 50:50 chance that he passes the gene that I could react to, the autoimmune/inflammation is the likely candidate.

She said we would need to do IVIg treatment before implantation and once again if I get a positive pregnancy test. Then they would have to monitor throughout pregnancy to see if more treatment is necessary. She also said we would treat with neupogen daily injections as well as steroids. Because the IVIg treatment is expensive, she wanted us to do IVF because the chances of pregnancy would be higher versus sex. My RE seemed very confident that the high NK cell activity and the increased cytokines is what led to the losses.

Your ANA is rather high. Did the test also check the pattern? My ANA could be related to my Hashimoto's or it could be something different altogether. Since my ANA wasn't tested before my first pregnancy, I don't know if this is a new issue or something that I had before my first successful pregnancy.

So in some ways, it would be reassuring if it was off because maybe one tiny tweak in the protocol might mean the next transfer works.

 The other test is the ReceptivaDx, which essentially tests for endometriosis. There's an abnormal expression of a certain gene in the endometrium that is highly correlated with having endometriosis, so it tests for that. If it's abnormal, you go on lupron for 2-3 months to quiet everything down, and then you do a transfer. The theory, I guess, is that you decrease the inflammation enough to get everything responding more normally in your uterus and give the embryo a higher chance of survival. This being abnormal would kind of suck just because of the time delay.

I'm not really sure if I want everything to be normal, so I can really just feel done after this third transfer, or if I want there to be something to fix. And if there is something to fix, do we really stop after one more, or do we try a fourth? =/

It's been a rollercoaster week.  Tuesday, we went for an NT scan.  Anatomy was healthy, but PAPP and hCG were borderline low.  It's another risk factor for T18 & T13 and made me think maybe the low fetal fraction from the NIPT wasn't a fluke.  Trisomy risks from the combined screen weren't ""high risk"", but they were still much higher than for my son (who didn't have a trisomy).  

Then we got some good news yesterday--2nd NIPT results came back earlier than expected: all low risk!  And fetal fraction was 300% higher than the first time.  

Since fetal fraction only increases about 0.1% per week at this stage, a slightly later draw doesn't explain the jump.  Rather, it seems like during the first draw, something about the sample collection/handling went wrong.  

Before my 2nd draw, I watched Natera's sample collection video, and then later caught the tech take out the wrong needle to use.  She was happy to change to the recommended needle type.  Not sure if that made the difference, but wanted to pass on the info for anyone who might do NIPT in the future.

I had my rainbow three weeks ago today. He was born at 38 weeks via c-section, at 9lb 2oz. He's doing well and my recovery is going great. I got a tubal ligation at the same time and it's the most in control of my fertility I've ever felt.

Otherwise I'm glad the journey is over. My goal for the next year is to focus on physical recovery from the miscarriage as I still struggle with some pain from my surgery. Getting control of my body again will be a nice end to everything.

I'm checking in from the other side, though I had my first RE appointment to discuss a plan for getting pregnant again so perhaps I can consider myself TTC but WTT for the moment? My little rainbow just turned 9 months old and is doing well. In other news, my husband is almost certainly getting a promotion that relocates us to Texas which is crazy, but exciting nonetheless. The relocation should be a temporary thing.

We met with the RE yesterday and made a plan. Since we have the 2 PGS normal-embryos in the freezer, we are going to start there. I mean, we did pay a crazy sum of money to acquire them and they are chromosomally normal, which clears one hurdle for us assuming we can get successful implantation. Why not start there and see if that works? My RE prefers a natural cycle FET, which surprised me since I've had lining issues. However, my US yesterday showed a 12mm follicle and already 7mm trilaminar lining! Between pregnancies 2-4 I was lucky to get to 5 or 6mm by ovulation, so this is great news. 

We were going to plan a saline US early next cycle to clear me for the FET, but yesterday's twanding showed a spot that was suspicious for fibroids or retained placenta (wtf) so I'll be getting a hysteroscopy instead. I'm hoping I can fit this in before my vacation in August, otherwise we will have to wait until September for the hysteroscopy and that will be closer to our move date so much more hectic. She also wants a cycle off between removing a fibroid and doing an FET, so if I can't get the hysteroscopy in a couple of weeks that will push our transfer date back to November. I want an October transfer so that would be disappointing, but not the end of the world. We will also retest my AMH and Vitamin D levels since my AMH was 0.68 more than 2 years ago. I'm afraid to see what it is now. If neither embryo implants (we will do one at a time), I'll go in for the full CD3/OAR testing to see how dire things are, but am going to think positively that we won't need to go there.

I would do the same for her if it happens to her again as I’ve seen the heartbreak she went through with her 3 miscarriages. It looked identical to my own tbh. I know every individual is different though. 

I’m sorry this is bringing up emotions that are obviously hard to deal with. I’d just be honest and not put yourself in any situation that could harm you emotionally.

<p>It is hard to even find a company with good health insurance and get hired there. Mainly because they don’t advertise their policy details. In my experience I have to know someone or get to the offer process to find out firm details.</p>

<p>With my loans being pretty much close to being paid off I can start school again. </p>

<p>Why can&#39;t I have my cake and eat it too 😩</p>

I don’t know your back story to see if you had a hard time conceiving to begin with, but it sounds like the emotions that come with trying are too much right now and maybe it’s going to be easier for you to not “try”. </p>

My second pregnancy ended on January 30th of this year. It took six weeks for my period to return. I had been 11.5 weeks along at the time.

I want to assure you that this 6-8 week break that your body is taking to get back to your period *is* your body working. Sometimes we expect too much of our bodies, but right now your entire system is working hard to heal from the trauma of an early pregnancy loss. 

To start growing a baby and then lose it is emotionally difficult, but it’s also taxing on your system. Your pregnancy hormones need to leave your body so your next cycle can start. Then, once this has happened, your body will build a whole new endometrium/ uterine lining to prepare to receive your next egg, should it be fertilized. You will ovulate, and maybe your egg will be fertilized and implant itself. But maybe it won’t. This is only because your system may still be in flux from the trauma it has recently been through. 

Your next period may be extra heavy, as there may still be some tissue that needs to pass. This is common. If and when you get your next period, I encourage you to see it as a good sign that your body and your hormones are getting ready to once again take on the enormous task of building a human. 

And if you were further along in your pregnancy, it can take even longer to heal. My first daughter was born still at 23 weeks and my body wasn’t able to recover for several months. 

I hope you will find it encouraging to know that, after I was feeling the way you are feeling now, I am once again expecting. I’m am 10 weeks along, which puts my new due date just 5.5 months out from my last one. There is hope. It just take a little time. 

You are still healing. Be kind to yourself. You are strong and life-giving. These sad and unfortunate losses happen to many of us, and nearly all of us go on to have the babies we long for. I wish you love and luck, and patience with yourself.

You might try asking this on the alumni questions thread, since I know a lot of people who have moved to the PregnancyAfterLoss or RainbowBabies groups look there. It's kind of hard to answer while following the rules about pregnancy talk...

Trigger Warning --- Clinical description of taking lovenox during pregnancy ---

We don't know if lovenox + baby aspirin is our answer yet but we are past our 6 first trimester losses. I haven't had any issues with the lovenox injections. The first one was hard mentally - I was scared to poke the needle in. But that has gotten very easy with practice. The medication stings a little bit going in, but nothing awful. I ice before and after each shot which helps with bruising. I haven't noticed any side effect other than the occasional bruise where I gave the shot. Overall, I would say that it is very worth trying.

If you're looking for more experiences with lovenox, there's a great group on Facebook called [""Lovenox Ladies""](https://www.facebook.com/groups/LovenoxLadies/).

Not gonna lie.  The past few days have been rough.  Instead of getting our NIPT results back, we waited two weeks, only to learn we had a ""no-call"" result.  I.e. The test failed to get a risk estimate.  

Apparently this happens in about 4% of cases. Usually due to low fetal fraction. Sometimes it's caused by a woman being heavier, but that's not my situation--my BMI is on the low end of normal.  Sometimes it's caused by aneuploidies--a no-call result raises the risk that chromosomal problems will be found--particularly a fatal aneuploidy like T18, T13, or triploidy.  

We've gone for a redraw, but the failure rate for redraws is higher than for first tests (at >=20% instead of the quoted 4%).  And when the redraw fails, the risk of chromosomal anomalies goes up more.  

So I'm not a happy camper right now.  I'm really happy we didn't forego the combined serum screen (sometimes women are advised to, because the NIPT is considered more accurate).   It means that we'll at least get some risk assessment from that on Tuesday, while we wait the two weeks to see what happens with the 2nd NIPT.  And we're guaranteed some risk assessment even if the 2nd NIPT fails.  

At the same time, I'm now worried for our NT scan on Tuesday, because what if they find problems with the baby's development?  

Last week, our family doctor observed that my husband and I seemed to be doing well on the stress/anxiety front, given our previous loss.  That's all gone out the window this week.  :-P  

Today I was slightly reassured, because I learned that our fetal fraction was on the low side, but not below the test's technical cut off (2.8%).  It's not as bad as it could be.  Still, I can't wait for more reassurance that baby is healthy.  

As a side note, I'm finding ""gender disappointment"" comments a little hard to take.  I find that ""I just want a healthy baby...but I really wanted baby to be X"" comments to be a little disingenuous.  

With my son, we were in the position of hoping that he was just ""healthy enough"" to ""only"" need open heart surgery at birth--with a 15% risk of death, a higher risk of neurological damage if he survived, and risks that he wouldn't be able to be physically active like a healthy child.  That was our best case scenario.  Now we're hoping that our baby doesn't have something fatal.  It just feels like most people don't truly understand what it means to ""just want a healthy baby.""  ",[],,t1_e1wpib6,False,0,[],False,"<div class=""md""><p>12 + 3 today.  </p>

<p>Not gonna lie.  The past few days have been rough.  Instead of getting our NIPT results back, we waited two weeks, only to learn we had a &quot;no-call&quot; result.  I.e. The test failed to get a risk estimate.  </p>

<p>Apparently this happens in about 4% of cases. Usually due to low fetal fraction. Sometimes it&#39;s caused by a woman being heavier, but that&#39;s not my situation--my BMI is on the low end of normal.  Sometimes it&#39;s caused by aneuploidies--a no-call result raises the risk that chromosomal problems will be found--particularly a fatal aneuploidy like T18, T13, or triploidy.  </p>

<p>We&#39;ve gone for a redraw, but the failure rate for redraws is higher than for first tests (at &gt;=20% instead of the quoted 4%).  And when the redraw fails, the risk of chromosomal anomalies goes up more.  </p>

<p>So I&#39;m not a happy camper right now.  I&#39;m really happy we didn&#39;t forego the combined serum screen (sometimes women are advised to, because the NIPT is considered more accurate).   It means that we&#39;ll at least get some risk assessment from that on Tuesday, while we wait the two weeks to see what happens with the 2nd NIPT.  And we&#39;re guaranteed some risk assessment even if the 2nd NIPT fails.  </p>

<p>At the same time, I&#39;m now worried for our NT scan on Tuesday, because what if they find problems with the baby&#39;s development?  </p>

<p>Last week, our family doctor observed that my husband and I seemed to be doing well on the stress/anxiety front, given our previous loss.  That&#39;s all gone out the window this week.  :-P  </p>

<p>Today I was slightly reassured, because I learned that our fetal fraction was on the low side, but not below the test&#39;s technical cut off (2.8%).  It&#39;s not as bad as it could be.  Still, I can&#39;t wait for more reassurance that baby is healthy.  </p>

<p>As a side note, I&#39;m finding &quot;gender disappointment&quot; comments a little hard to take.  I find that &quot;I just want a healthy baby...but I really wanted baby to be X&quot; comments to be a little disingenuous.  </p>

I'm sorry for your losses.  We know how you feel.  My husband and I lost our son to something that affects 1 in a million to 1 in 3 million babies.  Being that 1 is hard to wrap one's head around.  

Hopefully your providers will be more attentive having been admitted.

Hopefully the staff where you've been admitted, things get better.

I also understand the desire to look out for your husband--and it especially makes sense in periods where there's literally nothing that his presence there is going to help with.  But please don't hesitate to lean on him to help you advocate for yourself.  Especially if you have anxiety about an infection, your healing, and your fertility--if a little more investment from him can help you get better care and avoid complications down, it will be well worth a little lost sleep!

I'm so sorry for your losses. I went through a similar situation recently - an early miscarriage followed by a missed miscarriage all last year. I did the RPL testing also and results came back as heterozygous MTHFR. This is actually the more 'favourable' of heterozygous and homozygous and my doctor didn't think it was likely to have actually been responsible for either miscarriage. The second loss I found out was due to Turner's syndrome (through D&C testing) and now I am pretty convinced my first was also a chromosomal abnormality. Honestly it really is the most common cause of early miscarriage - completely unlucky an completely unfair but it is unfortunately reality.

(TW: current pregnancy)
Even though doc didn't think the MTHFR was a cause, she suggested baby aspirin also and I've been taking that ever since. Not sure if it has made a difference or not but I don't see much harm in it. I'm now 24 weeks with my third pregnancy - still have those days of being terrified of loss (now late loss) but so far it's been smooth sailing.

",[],,t1_e1vovt2,False,0,[],False,"<div class=""md""><p>Hi there,
I&#39;m so sorry for your losses. I went through a similar situation recently - an early miscarriage followed by a missed miscarriage all last year. I did the RPL testing also and results came back as heterozygous MTHFR. This is actually the more &#39;favourable&#39; of heterozygous and homozygous and my doctor didn&#39;t think it was likely to have actually been responsible for either miscarriage. The second loss I found out was due to Turner&#39;s syndrome (through D&amp;C testing) and now I am pretty convinced my first was also a chromosomal abnormality. Honestly it really is the most common cause of early miscarriage - completely unlucky an completely unfair but it is unfortunately reality.</p>

<p>(TW: current pregnancy)
Even though doc didn&#39;t think the MTHFR was a cause, she suggested baby aspirin also and I&#39;ve been taking that ever since. Not sure if it has made a difference or not but I don&#39;t see much harm in it. I&#39;m now 24 weeks with my third pregnancy - still have those days of being terrified of loss (now late loss) but so far it&#39;s been smooth sailing. Am hoping this story might give you some hope in what I&#39;m sure has been a really difficult time for you. As far as going forward I definitely recommend the baby aspirin (whether it makes a difference or not, it&#39;s nice to feel as though you are being proactive about it). Fingers crossed for you x</p>

Anyway, you should obviously defer to your doctor re: blood thinners, but the MTHFR mutation is certainly not an indication for anticoagulation.

I hope this helps, and best of luck with everything!

A recap of the good, the bad, and the ugly can be found below. 

The good: I got a positive OPK for the *first time in my life* (or at least since tracking in Aug17)! We had pretty good timing for what FF thinks was O - I'm not entirely convinced on the date, given that it switched it because of my temps on days 12-13DPO, but still. We also had sex 8 days in a row.

The bad: ..those 8 days didn't count because my troll body decided that it would ovulate on CD25-27 instead of my previous cycles (pre-loss) that were much, much sooner. I ovulated day 28 after my D&C, but I just assumed that was because it was taking a while for hCG to go down. Maybe this is my new normal (long cycles). I don't like that. Oh, and obviously not pregnant. Not a post-loss unicorn. 

The ugly: I feel like every thought I had this cycle was about TTC. It was honestly scary and somewhat depressing to realize how each day affected me because of what was going on in my cycle. I had a lot of moments of anger and frustration waiting to O, and then a lot of hope and then disappointment just waiting for AF to show up. My hope is to be a bit more chill about this next cycle and realize that it isn't the end of the world every morning if I don't get a positive test. I'm looking ahead to planning some trips for the fall and I am trying to keep everything in perspective. 

Today and yesterday, flow has been extremely heavy and I didn't really have that with the last period after the loss, so I'm hoping this shortens my cycle a bit again. I looked ahead to this month in terms of O date and if it's consistent, that puts us in Italy at the right time. If it's earlier than that, then I'll maybe have a part of my TWW while we're abroad. It would be a welcome distraction (and then I can thankfully not feel guilty about all the wine and cheese I'll be having, since there will be no way to have a positive test before we leave)!

Much of your history resonates with me.  I also was pregnant a week behind my sister (my first, her second).  I also lost my son through a TFMR.  And I'm also over 35, so I have the same fears about higher risks for trisomies with future pregnancies the older I get.  

What I've learned is that it's not uncommon 3-4 months out to feel like healing has stalled.  Or even like you're backsliding and feeling worse.  And just around this time, family & friends--people who've never been through something like this and who don't understand what it's like--were surprised to hear that I was still feeling bad at all.  It was like they were surprised I wasn't ""over it.""  

I sometimes feel the world has been split into two: people who've been through losses, and for whom things like, ""Do not expect sister who was due a week after you, but whose daughter died, to come to your shower"" are no brainers.  And people who haven't had a loss like this, and think things are back to normal after 12 weeks or something.  

Honestly, I put a lot of distance between myself and my family after our loss.  They meant well, but their responses were not helpful, and in some cases put more burden on me (kind of like your crazy aunt).  I know others here have had to stop attending weekly dinners with pregnant SIL, skip baptisms of nieces or nephews, opt out of best friends' baby showers....  

You're entitled to take care of you. I found [ring theory](http://articles.latimes.com/2013/apr/07/opinion/la-oe-0407-silk-ring-theory-20130407) really helpful.  *You* are the one with the loss.  *You* are the one your family should be accommodating as much as possible.   

Beyond the shower, I'll say: after my loss, reading other people's stories helped me a lot.  [Ending a Wanted Pregnancy](https://endingawantedpregnancy.com/)  had a lot of helpful material (and they have a private Facebook support group). 

Our library had [*The Prenatal Bombshell*](https://www.amazon.com/Prenatal-Bombshell-Continuing-Pregnancy-Diagnosis-ebook/dp/B00Y2A3JXE). I found it to be a helpful, non-judgmental guide for navigating this type of loss. It covers everything including TFMR, perinatal hospice, having a child with disabilities, and what comes after these things.  

In addition to a bereavement counselor, we/I started going regularly to a parent support group for general perinatal loss. (The closest one specifically for TFMR is 2 hrs away from us, but you might live closer to one.)  Being in person with other parents who went through losses like ours, and understood these sorts of things was helpful.",[],,t1_e1qlkwd,False,0,[],False,"<div class=""md""><p>I&#39;m so sorry for the loss of your daughter Madeline.  </p>

<p>Much of your history resonates with me.  I also was pregnant a week behind my sister (my first, her second).  I also lost my son through a TFMR.  And I&#39;m also over 35, so I have the same fears about higher risks for trisomies with future pregnancies the older I get.  </p>

<p>What I&#39;ve learned is that it&#39;s not uncommon 3-4 months out to feel like healing has stalled.  Or even like you&#39;re backsliding and feeling worse.  And just around this time, family &amp; friends--people who&#39;ve never been through something like this and who don&#39;t understand what it&#39;s like--were surprised to hear that I was still feeling bad at all.  It was like they were surprised I wasn&#39;t &quot;over it.&quot;  </p>

<p>I sometimes feel the world has been split into two: people who&#39;ve been through losses, and for whom things like, &quot;Do not expect sister who was due a week after you, but whose daughter died, to come to your shower&quot; are no brainers.  And people who haven&#39;t had a loss like this, and think things are back to normal after 12 weeks or something.  </p>

<p>Honestly, I put a lot of distance between myself and my family after our loss.  They meant well, but their responses were not helpful, and in some cases put more burden on me (kind of like your crazy aunt).  I know others here have had to stop attending weekly dinners with pregnant SIL, skip baptisms of nieces or nephews, opt out of best friends&#39; baby showers....  </p>

I just can’t shake the feeling like something is off with my hormones over the last year (low libido, fatigue, general grumpiness) which is not my baseline. I suppose I just need to be patient and see how it goes. Thanks again for your insight. </p>

Most miscarriages are caused by chromosomal abnormalities. Did you have genetic testing done when you had your D&C?

Besides chromosomal issues, miscarriages can be caused by clotting disorders, anatomical issues, immune disorders or even just shitty luck.

At your stage, I wouldn’t worry yet that there is something wrong. You can choose to do some basic tests for clotting, karyotyping or even a sperm analysis.

<p>I understand the desire to start TTCing and be pregnant again.  But if your HCG is still elevated, it&#39;s probably good for your piece of mind to wait until it goes down.

My fourth pregnancy resulted in a full term stillbirth.

Antibodies, either you have them outside the normal range or not. If they are elevated you are diagnosed with either hashimotos or graves.

You are hypo, and having a level above 2 can absolutely impact fertilely and pregnancy. I get really really riled up that doctors keep people feeling so sick. This quote from the STTM page I linked is exactly what I'm talking about, doctors use a random lab range and ignore how people feel:

“The consensus of thyroidologists decided in 1973 that the TSH (lab) was the blood test they had been looking for all through the years. This was about two years after I started practice. Having been taught how to diagnose hypothyroid conditions clinically, I was in a position to watch to see what the relation of the TSH was to the onset of hypothyroidism. What I found was many people would develop classic signs and symptoms of hypothyroidism but the TSH was ever so slow to become abnormal, rise and confirm the clinical diagnosis. Sometimes it never did. Finally I began treating patients with hypothyroid in the normal manner I was taught. I could not see why I had to wait for the TSH to rise for me to be able to treat them.”

You're entitled to be upset about the things you're upset about. They're pretty common struggles.  At the same time, if I'm being honest, some of what you wrote made me wince.  And I thought right away of a few others on this sub who've been active here the last several months, and who've written a lot about how long it takes them to get pregnant and/or the interventions they need (and with losses, they have no LCs).  There was a daily discussion thread back in...April, maybe?...where a group of women were talking about the pains of losing not only their babies, but also ""parenthood"" and ""family"" and an identity as ""mothers"" when their losses were going to be their first LC.  

There are also plenty of people here like you who have LC's, and/or who got pregnant quickly the first time, but are struggling now (or who don't have a problem getting pregnant, but rather with RPL).  

Part of what makes it work is, as /u/appeleyes said, people go out of their way to share things in a sensitive way.  Their language is sensitive, they include TW's, and they acknowledge that other's haven't had some of the (relative) blessings that they've had.  And we error on the side of protecting the most vulnerable (like the recent vote to not allow alumni to put EDDs in their flairs).  

I don't participate in the infertility sub, but if you told a group of people not simply that you were ""new"" (everyone is new at some point) but also that you didn't ""identify"" with them or feel you were one of them...but were still there reaching out for support...     I understand you were just trying to be honest and explain where you are at, but if the shoe were on the other foot, can you see how that might not have come across very well?

Sorry you've gotten negative vibes on other subs....people in the thick of ttc struggles for #1 are understandably sensitive about the hearing about living kids and successful pregnancies, though of course that is not a good reason to make others feel excluded.

I actually had to put a picture we had up of me pregnant away because I was triggered by myself, which is so messed up!

I also was one of those bitches I now kind of hate who got pregnant on their first try with #1.

Well according to their rules you have to post super cryptically or something about any previous pregnancies let alone living children. So I edited my post slightly but that apparently wasn't within their ruleset either. I was confused and honestly felt very attacked while trying to be vulnerable.

In my comment itself I had mentioned I didn't *really* identify with the infertility sub simply because I had had my diagnosis officially not even 2 months. I didn't feel comfortable in the regular TFAB sub because I've had a miscarriage and some of that rubs off on my TTC thoughts and feelings and I had been posting here but not everyone here has had fertility struggles other than pregnancy losses. So I mentioned I've never really posted in infertility, lurked but never posted because I hadn't yet identified internally as ""a woman who struggles with fertility issues "". I still identify more as ""a woman who has had a miscarriage and is trying to get pregnant again"". It just felt very angry and stand offish and just hurtful. So I'm not longer in that sub. I'll stay here where the whole ""I want to be pregnant. I've been pregnant before. Why doesn't my body want to be pregnant again"" talk is okay.

As for the surgery thing. Part of it I think is I need to almost convince the doctor that he should do it or at the very least investigate a bit more. Like I wonder if I don't have some kind of pelvic prolapse. Very mild. But enough that it is either causing tissue and ""stuff"" to not be expelled during my period (on day 2.5 of my period I would have awful cramps then they would leave as instantly as they started. Would change tampon shortly after and I would have passed like almost the entire uterine lining in one go. That doesn't happen anymore. Can't remember if that was simply after my son was born 2.5 years ago. Or if that was after the miscarriage) or if that has caused some portion of my reproductive tract to collapse a bit on itself making it hard for swimmers to get where they are supposed to be. Or maybe there a tiny bit of leftovers from the miscarriage that is tricking my body into not accepting a new pregnancy. But not enough to cause a infection or anything like that, assuming that's even something that is possible at all that is.

I don't know. My boss is super understanding but it's hard to schedule like 6 weeks off when EVERYONE is away right now for stuff and our staff base is super small to begin with. So we will see.

Or if that was after the miscarriage) or if that has caused some portion of my reproductive tract to collapse a bit on itself making it hard for swimmers to get where they are supposed to be. Or maybe there a tiny bit of leftovers from the miscarriage that is tricking my body into not accepting a new pregnancy. But not enough to cause a infection or anything like that, assuming that&#39;s even something that is possible at all that is.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t know. My boss is super understanding but it&#39;s hard to schedule like 6 weeks off when EVERYONE is away right now for stuff and our staff base is super small to begin with. So we will see. When we had everything investigated he told me that he appreciates me doing my best to schedule my appointments and procedures <em>around</em> my schedule. Which I responded by saying that that is the responsible thing an employee does when at all possible.. </p>

> First, there is a confirmation of previously known findings, namely that: 1) euthyroid women with thyroid autoantibodies tend to be older when they become pregnant; 2) even though euthyroid in early gestational stages, these women tend to have a reduced thyroid functional reserve; 3) they have an increased risk for obstetrical complications (miscarriage and premature delivery); and 4) when given the benefit of treatment with thyroid hormone, they normalize thyroid function tests and behave as control women.

I guess I'm just not sure if I should be less concerned because I don't actually have hypothyroidism yet. Or at least, not according to anyone I've talked to - I'm honestly not sure what values they would consider as ""qualifying"" for a diagnosis, since it seems like the acceptable ranges for all things thyroid-related are so controversial. I only know I'm positive for antibodies. I don't really know why I used ""active"" in my word choice but I meant I do not have a current diagnosis related to a thyroid disorder (just a half-dozen other autoimmune disorders). I know sometimes there are different targets for normal vs. treated so wasn't sure if the <2 target is universal or only for those with a treatment plan.

So those links are already very valuable, thank you so much for sharing them.

If you have antibodies and your TSH is 3.3 I am going to guess you have hashimotos. There are some that think antibodies are fairly irrelevant, they fluctuate and there is not a whole lot you can do about it. I found that I had some food sensitivities, and cutting out those foods brought them down. Another thing that can help antibodies is systemic enzymes. They can help calm your immune system down. 
I got mine (still not into normal ranges but) from over 900 to under 160. 

I would be much more concerned with your TSH and your other thyroid levels. 

I'm not sure what you mean by active? Can you explain?

I hope it's not, but it's very likely you will have a really hard time finding a doctor to treat your thyroid the way it should be. That being said, even my (ex) old school endo said my TSH should not be over 2. When it's been over two I feel like I've been hit by a bus, but didn't know how bad I felt until I felt better. 

There's a phenomenal group on Facebook called Thyroid Advocates and they have a pregnancy group too.  The website Stop The Thyroid Madness, while being a bit overwhelming at first and quickly dismissed by doctors, is a wealth of information.

But honestly I probably will be anxious, feel like something is wrong, and all that. Sorry again for your very recent loss.</p>

Okay, so first of all-dont go down the rabbit hole of Google and if you do be sure to check your sources since there's a lot of misinformation out there. 

There are different variations of the MTHFR mutation. The two most ""severe"" being homozygous C677T (meaning the person carries 2 copies of C677T alle) and compound heterogyzenous (which means the person carries 1 copy of the C677T alle and 1 copy of the A1982C alle.) 

Having 1 or 2 copies of A1982C, or only 1 copy of C677T is pretty much a non-issue, they're very common and haven't been found to cause any issues. 

Now, if you have homozygous C677T or compound heterogyzenous the primary concern is homocysteine. Since these variations of MTHFR can greatly affect your bodies ability to break down homocysteine into folate. Too much homocysteine in the body can lead to something called homocystinuria. Which isn't common, even in people with these variations. This can cause blood clots, which some doctors believe are linked to miscarriage in women with MTHFR (clots forming between the placenta and uterus) but the evidence proving causation is pretty shaky. 

So, if you have one of these variations, you'll want to ask your doctor to check your homocysteine levels. This is done by bloodtest. If they come back normal, you have nothing to be concerned about. If they come back high, you can work with your doctor to get them normal. 

Your doctor may recommend blood thinners during pregnancy depending on the results of your homocysteine testing, but generally you won't need any additional treatment and your MTHFR will not affect you in the slightest.

I have a LC as well and I like the idea of the necklace with both names. A few days after she passed I bought a necklace of two connected hearts, one representing her and the other my living family. I wanted to symbolize that she will always be connected to us. </p>

I am actually in a bit of similar position - I have just turned 40, and finally fall pregnant first time in my life after my birthday, however we just loss the baby at 7 weeks.  It is hard, very hard, mentally and physically, especially at our age.

But I found it easier with support from closed friends, and the wonderful people in here (and other related sub).  Of course I didn't broadcast it to everyone when I was pregnant, but I did tell a couple of friends who know we were trying (I actually considered to be single mum via IVF before when I was long time single), and I know they are the one who can keep their mouth shut, but also understand not every pregnancy end with a baby, who would be able to give me support if that is the case - and they did.  It really means a lot to me after a day running around to ultrasound (to confirm the miscarriage), to GP, to acupuncturist ... then back home seeing flower arrived on my door step.  

(Although having said that, texting with friend is ok, but I don't think I want to do social gathering too soon.  Now I just want to lay low, spend time with my hubby and support each other)

But in the last 3 weeks I somehow frustrated on why people treat miscarriage like something forbidden to talk about.  It affects so many people, and it is heartbroken, it affects us physically.  It is not as easy as other people say ""just try again"" ... and it was a life, inside my body.

I had three miscarriages, one in April of 2015, and we had given up TTC. Literally had the conversation and everything. I stopped counting cycles/days, I had no idea when my period was due and I started spotting. For two weeks. I called my doctor who asked how long I had been spotting, I told her.

Usually the FRERs are quite accurate 1 or 2 days after a missed period.  You can always find an exception on the internet, but a lot of us find it easier to not raise expectations too high.

Only a blood test from your doctor can determine if you're experiencing a pregnancy, a CP, or a false positive on that first test.  You might want to call your doctor/RE and see if you can get one before the weekend.  

As for symptoms, a couple TTC-ers have mentioned keeping a diary of their pre-period symptoms each month.

<p>I just ignore it. It&#39;s stuff like this that makes me not want to tell then anything. Even my family who knows we are having difficulties sometimes acts like it&#39;s my fault that I&#39;m not getting pregnant and it&#39;s gotten to the point that if I do none if these assholes are gonna know until I can&#39;t hide it anymore.</p>

<p>I&#39;m sorry you&#39;re dealing with it and the disappointment as well. I wish I could say it gets better, but for me it hasn&#39;t. </p>

She&#39;s even having a boy too. </p>

<p>I know she didn&#39;t mean for it to happen, but it has made my healing process very hard on myself. I don&#39;t want to lose my best friend but I think I will have to distance myself, to the point of disconnecting most likely. </p>

<p>There&#39;s just so much I can&#39;t handle - I can&#39;t listen to the good things, I can&#39;t stand to hear anyone complain about pregnancy, she&#39;s only been with the dad since December, I&#39;m her best friend and was there for her when her mom died suddenly 2 years ago, but she dropped off the face of the earth when Declan died. </p>

<p>Woooow I&#39;m just ranting now. You&#39;re not alone in not wanting to hear about anyone else&#39;s babies - so many of us are, unfortunately, right there with you</p>

I like my OB's nurse, but she could barely contain her excitement and proclaimed *Congratulations!* on the phone.

I am sorry for your loss. Just looking at your info, my mc was a few days after yours at around the 9 week mark. It feels like so long ago but has actually only been a few months. 

 I have people saying 'if you stop thinking about it, it will happen' 'worrying and stressing makes it harder'...well now I'm thinking about it and worrying and stressing again! I also think the loss gets a bit lost in it all and it they just see it as it is taking a long time to conceive. All they have is anecdotes of someone they know, but it really has no bearing on my journey, as they are all different, and I would rather not hear it. 

I consider myself pretty laid back, and I don't usually stress easily. So maybe what I could really be feeling is just sadness that I should be 6+ months pregnant and my life should be so different right now. I wouldn't consider that an unreasonable emotion to have. 

A hobby is definitely a good idea, and a creative one at that! When I was completing my art degree, my thoughts were quite often taken up with the project I was working on and my next ideas. It may be a good time to jump back in.

Blood tests: 

* Factor II
* Beta-2 Glycoprotein 1 IGG AB
* Beta-2 Glycoprotein 1 IGM AB
* TSH, T4, and T3 (ensure its a full Thyroid panel)
* Antinuclear antibody (ANA)
* Factor V Mutation,
* prothrombin gene mutation
* Anticardiolipin AGG+IGM
* Lupus Anticoagulant Comp,
* Hgb A1c and Estim. Ave Glu (eAG)
* Antimullerian Hormone (AMH)
* Baseline LH (CD3 test)
* FSH (CD3 test)
* Estradiol (CD3 test)
* LH during surge time
* Estradiol during surge time
* Homocysteine
* DHEA Sulfate
* Insulin
* Prolactin
* Day 21 Progesterone testing (numerous cycles)
* Blood karyotyping
* Ferritin
* Folates
* Total Iron Binding Capacity with Iron
* Reticulocyte Count
* Vitamin B12
* Folic Acid
* Protein S
* Protein C

Others:

* Genetic testing on one baby after MC
* Saline Ultrasound
* karyotyping on both of us
* Hysteroscopy with endometrial biopsy
* 23andme (which I used for my MTHFR results mainly, ordered before my 2nd loss just because we were curious)

A word of warning about what is about to follow...I really like skincare (for reasons I outline in my original post--it's become a calming, self-nurturing ritual). Below is my current evening routine, which I realize seems totally insane. But I swear it only takes me about 5-7 minutes (with much of that going towards the facial massage), and I cherish that meditative self-care time I take for myself each night.

My skin type: Combination-oily, with some hyperpigmented spots leftover by the 1-2 large (hormonal) pimples I reliably get each month. I'm also very pale, so I struggle with redness. Let me know if you have a different skin type, and I might have some recs for that, too!

1. **Waterproof eye makeup remover** (if wearing waterproof mascara)--I like to soak cotton pads with the [Garnier Micellar Water](https://www.amazon.com/Garnier-SkinActive-Micellar-Cleansing-Waterproof/dp/B017PCGAXQ)
2. **Facial massage with an oil-based cleanser**
3. **Gentle, water-based cleanser**--I always go for no frills, inexpensive, gentle (i.e., low pH) cleansers. I'm currently using the [Cerave Hydrating Cleanser](https://www.amazon.com/CeraVe-Hydrating-Facial-Cleanser-Washing/dp/B01MSSDEPK/ref=sr_1_4_s_it?s=beauty&ie=UTF8&qid=1529939699&sr=1-4&keywords=cerave+hydrating+cleanser), but I've also really enjoyed these two Korean cleansers: [CosRX Good Morning Gel Cleanser](https://www.ulta.com/low-ph-good-morning-gel-cleanser?productId=xlsImpprod16661017) and [Heimish All Clean Green Foam](https://ohlolly.com/products/heimish-all-clean-green-foam-ph-5-5).
4. **Hydrating Toner**--I've been enjoying this one recently: [Pyunkang Yul Essence Toner](https://ohlolly.com/collections/toners-serums/products/pyunkang-yul-essence-toner)
5. **Serum**--I love [this one](https://www.glowrecipe.com/products/leegeehaam-tea-tree-90-essence) for my skin type. Pricey, but a little goes a long way, and it really helps calm redness.
6. **Facial Oil**--I use [rose hip oil](https://www.cultbeauty.co.uk/the-ordinary-100-organic-cold-pressed-rose-hip-seed-oil.html) because it helps with hyperpigmentation. Since it's summer and I have oily skin, I usually don't need to use a moisturizer over this. But if you have dry skin, using an oil followed by a moisturizer is great!

I also exfoliate and/or use a clay-based mask once or twice a week. [This glycolic acid mask](https://www.cultbeauty.co.uk/ren-glycol-lactic-radiance-renewal-mask.html) is great (and pregnancy-safe!) as long as your skin isn't overly sensitive. It's pricey, but it lasts a really long time. And I really like [this Clinique charcoal mask](https://www.sephora.com/product/pore-refining-solutions-charcoal-mask-P395642?skuId=1677202&om_mmc=ppc-GG_1165716902_53825943060_aud-299050439198:pla-419047721894_1677202_257731950212_9060065_c&country_switch=us&lang=en&gclid=CJmF9K2L79sCFYv3swodYNIOeA&gclsrc=ds). With each of these, I wash my face as usual (steps 1-3 above), then wear the mask for 10 minutes, rinse it off, and proceed with steps 4-6.

**EDITED TO ADD: You definitely don't have to do all these steps!** You can get a very similar feeling (smooth, calm skin) from just the double-cleanse followed by a toner and moisturizer. For moisturizers, I'm a big fan of the [Cerave PM](https://www.amazon.com/CeraVe-Facial-Moisturizing-Lotion-Lightweight/dp/B00365DABC) and the [Pyunkang Yul Nutrition Cream (if you have dry skin)](https://ohlolly.com/collections/moisturizers/products/pyunkang-yul-nutrition-cream).

Since then, it's become an essential part of a self-loving, self-nurturing nightly routine that I end every single day with, no matter what. This routine helps me conclude each day feeling more centered, comforted, and at peace. This has been particularly important over the months since our loss.

I generally take only about 1-3 minutes to massage my face--being sure to concentrate on my temples, masseters, cheeks, eyebrows, and the center of my forehead (I discovered I carry a lot of tension in these areas). As soon as I begin, I can feel my pulse and blood pressure dropping, and the tightness that my facial muscles had accumulated over the course of the day melts away. After that, I rinse off whatever oil/balm I was using for the massage and wash my face with a facial cleanser as usual. 

This ""double cleanse"" has been in the beauty media a lot recently, since K-beauty started gaining popularity. There are certainly skincare benefits of doing this (you *actually* remove all of your sunscreen, makeup, oil-based dirt). But for me, it's all about the massage and the end-of-day meditation that comes with it.

**How To:**

In case you missed the link above, here is a facial massage how-to by Lisa Eldridge (she spends *much* longer on it than I do, but she gives some good tips about techniques/movements). She gives some product recs for the first few minutes, and the technique/how-to portion starts at about 4:15: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CdkgqXBXprY

There are lots of cleansing oils and balms out there that are really good for facial massage. But here are two cleansing balms that I've enjoyed--you *massage them onto dry skin*, and they transform into an oil texture. To remove, *simply rinse off with water*:

[Heimish - All Clean Balm](https://www.amazon.com/Heimish-Clean-Balm-Cleansing-120ml/dp/B01CJ639SM)

I hope you can all find as much peace and joy in this as I have.
