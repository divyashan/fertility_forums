Be as gentle as you can on yourself in the coming months.  Life will be so indescribably hard.  And then one day you will feel a moment of sanity - you will feel okay.  Try to accept those moments when they come, and not feel guilty for them.  Little Oliver would not want you to be miserable, and it will not bring you any closer to him.  That is not to say you should not grieve - there is seemingly bottomless sorrow ahead for you right now.  Do what you can to accept each moment as it comes, moment by moment.

Went to a retreat with my loss support group yesterday and it was soooooooo nice to connect with other women whose lives aren't perfect. Just a day of yoga and writing and art and authentic sharing. Just what I didn't know I needed. 

Baby was super active all day, too, which I always appreciate.

Self-protection, for sure.

Here goes - I was super scared to get the cerclage. It freaked me out to be awake during the procedure and even worse, husband couldn’t be with me. It turns out that the anticipation was much worse than the actual day. I arrived at the hospital and got checked into outpatient surgery. A couple of hours later I was wheeled to the OR where my spinal block was placed. The block was a breeze - felt one little pinch from the numbing stuff but then didn’t feel anything else. They laid me down and I was numb within a minute or two. Shortly after procedure started - within 30 minutes they were done. You can feel some tugging and pulling but no pain. The worst part is being inverted on an operating table in stirrups - talk about feeling exposed...They placed a catheter and I was wheeled to recovery. Husband was waiting for me which helped a lot. The next few hours are rough - when the block starts to wear off you’ll be in a decent amount of pain. They will give you meds if you need them. I was discharged as soon as I could stand on my own and empty my bladder (once catheter was removed) - about 4 hours. The pain continued for about 2 days - by Sunday (my procedure was early Friday morning) I was feeling much better and walking around. You need to take it really easy for the first few days though. Assuming everything goes well you should have little to no restrictions. We were given a “no sex” order but honestly I’m not sure if that was due to the cerclage or the constant infections I’m fighting that antibiotics can’t seem to beat. I am also on weekly progesterone injections that work together with the cerclage to relax the uterus and fight infection. I have been back to see my MFM to measure my cervix every 4 weeks (or anytime I’m feeling nervous).  My MFM said that in his history of cerclages he’s only had 2 fail - and he’s done the procedure hundreds of times. The cerclage is typically removed between 36-37 weeks so you can go into labor naturally.  Because I’m having a c-section mine will be removed at that time.

From what I understand, NIPTs only check for a few relatively common chromosomal issues.

Kinda dissapointing since we'd love to have more information about whether this chromosomal issue of mine is contributing to our losses.

We've tried testing tissue post-miscarriage but weren't able to get results and I'd strongly prefer to avoid a D&C for a variety of reasons.

We have also lost a baby at 16 weeks and had a full karyotype and microarray. The baby was chromosomally normal, so an NIPT would not have predicted this loss. We had a lot of ultrasounds and there were no signs of any trouble - strong heart beat and good growth right up to our baby boy's death. Sadly, I don't think we're going to get a sure answer for what happened, though my doctors strongly suspect blood clotting. We'll be trying heparin in future pregnancies.

My husband and I probably won't choose to do any NIPT tests for future pregnancies, since it can't answer questions about my chromosomal issue or blood clotting, which are our main concerns.

I had a TFMR at 20 weeks due to a bunch of anomalies. I was told my son would either die inside of me or he would die shortly after birth. We were told it was either T18 or Triploidy but I don't have the results back from the placenta yet. 

My son had an Omphalocele, which is usually accompanied by T18 or T13 (or 16? I can't remember) but can also just be isolated cases which will require surgery after birth and some monitoring but can usually end up okay. That wasn't the case with us. He also was measuring about 2 weeks behind in growth. He would turn his hands inward toward him. He had a small jaw, a heart defect, abdominal wall defect, problems with kidneys as well as missing bones in his one arm and his other bones were measuring small. He would not live and although my decision was the hardest one I've ever made in my life, i couldn't have him suffer or have my family and boyfriend lose a baby after birth (if he made it that far) 

I had to wait 2 weeks after our diagnosis to have my surgery done. Those two weeks *sucked*. I didn't feel him move too much before that, but it seemed all he did was move around while waiting. 

I kind of went numb before hand. I cried a lot. I cried because I'd never hold him and I cried because it felt like my fault. I don't think there's much you can do while awaiting the appointment because it's going to suck no matter what. 

Asking for an ultrasound picture may be very good for you. I had been previously given some but we decided to get his foot prints as a keepsake. At first I didn't think I'd be able to look at them, but I have and I'm so glad I did. 

Whatever you think you need to grieve or what you may want as a reminder is what you should do. If that be an ultrasound photo, hearing the heart beat, foot prints. Do it all. If you can't bear to look at them, put them in a box. But I would recommend getting them as this little one is a part of you and will be forever...and sometimes having something to look at instead of a memory is comforting. 

Grieving is not going to be linear and you will have days where you're okay, and days where you cannot bear the world. And that's okay too. This isn't easy and you don't have to be okay (and I myself and just starting to realize that). 

I don't know if this has helped at all...but as someone who has gone through what you're going through, I understand and just wanted to give some of what worked for me. The ladies here are so wonderful given the shit circumstances we've been through.

My husband and I are just beginning to cope with our loss (I'm 14 weeks, and we just found out that our baby has trisomy 18 two days ago--I'll be undergoing a surgical termination next week), and we've already gotten a whole slew of ignorant and unhelpful comments. I guess this is just something we'll have to get used to.

I think some of this stems from the fact that most people take for granted the ability to get pregnant and give birth to healthy children. Miscarriage and pregnancy loss aren't talked about nearly as much as they should be, so people have the illusion that these things are less common than they actually are. And people always like to think that they're somehow immune to bad news in general--kind of like how people like to convince themselves that they won't get cancer (I take vitamins, I run, I don't smoke). Obviously there are things you can do to minimize the odds of something terrible happening to you, but at the end of the day, that's all they are: odds. 

But nobody likes to think they're just rolling the dice--everyone wants to convince themselves that they're somehow in control. I'm sure that my friends assume that my pregnancy must have been abnormal from the start. Scientifically speaking, this is true, since trisomy 18 begins as a cell division error at conception. But outwardly speaking, it's not at all true. I've had a completely uncomplicated pregnancy--normal first trimester symptoms, no spotting or cramping, a normal 8-week ultrasound, and a strong healthy heart beat (which my little girl *still* has even as she's slowly dying inside of me). Part of me wants to tell them this, but that makes me feel kind of evil since I know that all I'd be accomplishing is scaring the shit out of them...ultimately, I don't think it will make me feel better to rob them of their sense of comfort and immunity.

I'm just so envious of people who can continue to go through life with that blissful ignorance. ""Oh, you can just get pregnant again."" I can see why that seems like a pretty simple fix if you're of the mindset that unprotected sex = pregnancy = healthy baby 9 months later. I mean, this is what we were all taught in high school sex ed. To these people, it must almost like you ordered a pizza and then dropped it on the ground and are really upset about. ""So uhh...why don't you just order another pizza?"" 

For the rest of us who have had difficulty conceiving and/or pregnancy loss, these simple equations don't exist anymore. Unprotected sex = months or even years of disappointment and tearing up at the sight of menstrual blood. Pregnancy = months of anxiety and fighting the expectation you now have that something will go wrong, it's just a matter of when.

I would also question the blanket recommendation if you're dealing with health problems after the miscarriage. It may make more sense to monitor your health and lab work and use that to decide when to try again, instead of using a time table.

It took about 3 months and change after I delivered my stillborn son at 20 weeks in October. I had been temping and tracking fertility signs, mostly because I didn't want to be surprised by a period all of a sudden, but it made the wait that much more annoying. Plus there was no recognizable pattern until just a few weeks ago, so it felt like a lot of effort to just get back gibberish in my chart. 

We had originally planned on trying again right away, but I'm now considering a job change. If I make a switch, I would ideally not get pregnant for at least a month or two after starting - mostly because there's a chance I'll be horribly ill during the first trimester, like I was with my now 18mo daughter, which wouldn't be great in the first few months of a new job. I wasn't sick with my son, who I lost, so if I'm *not* physically sick in my next first trimester, I'll be a giant ball of anxiety. If I don't change jobs, I would want to get pregnant pretty soon since I'm established where I am and the mat leave is decent. And if jobs weren't in the equation, I would definitely want to go ahead and try to get pregnant. I really hope to have kids close-ish in age, and I also have no idea if it will be hard for us to get pregnant this time around or not (wasn't hard the first two times, but you never know). So maybe we should try sooner in case it takes a while. 

All of that to say.... I'm completely overthinking everything and feel baffled as to what to do with the information that I'm coming into my fertile period right now. Sex? No sex? Pull-out? I've driven myself crazy! Had sex yesterday because we just wanted to, and I guess we'll just stick to that. Not force it, but not avoid it.

There’s an egg icon on it today, and I’m making eyes at my husband all morning and saying ‘I got an egg!’ As if that’s code for ‘come hither and bone me’.

Never feel bad about how you feel.

It doesn't matter how much time passes, or how much people that have never had a loss don't understand, you're entitled to everything you are feeling. It does get easier, but the pain never goes away completely. Reach out as much as you can. What helped me the most after my loss was talking with people who understood what I was going tthrough and people that were going through similar experiences. You're never alone. 

My long cycles didn't start until 16 months ago, and we started ttc again recently because I have Adeno and some other health issues that leave me with limited time if I want to ttc even though I'm only 25. So I know what you mean about feeling pressure to conceive before it's too late. Like I already said, I tend to obsess a lot, and when I do something that really helps is just trying to stay busy and keep my mind working. It sounds like you already have a really great hobby, but what about trying something new too, since you seem to associate your loss with your hobby? I started crocheting after another loss mom talked me into it. She's super good at it and she donates everything she makes to her local nicu. But when I have too much time to think and I start to get overwhelmed and frustrated, it helps to have something to do to keep my hands busy and it gives me something to get excited about and work towards. Reading helps a lot too when I have the time. Hang in there. Please don't be afraid to reach out to me if you need someone to talk or vent to. ",[],,t1_dtblnl0,False,0,[],False,"<div class=""md""><p>I have super long cycles too. They said they ruled out pcos but they haven&#39;t found any other reasons for what&#39;s happening either. My typical cycle is anywhere from three to five months. So I definitely feel your frustration. It&#39;s so hard seeing everyone else getting to try two, three, or even four times in the time it takes you to get one shot. And the. When it doesn&#39;t work, knowing you don&#39;t have any idea when you&#39;ll get another chance just sucks. I&#39;m not overweight or diabetic either, but I&#39;m starting Clomid and metformin in a couple weeks after my next appointment. Maybe give it a shot? I know a lot of women with pcos who had really good luck with metaformin/Clomid. </p>

<p>I&#39;m a little different than you in that I only had once loss, a stillborn daughter at 25 weeks in Oct. 2015, so I don&#39;t have the experience with reoccurring miscarriages, and I can&#39;t even imagine how difficult that most be. After my loss, I pretty much became obsessed with trying again. Crying every time I saw a pregnant woman, constantly thinking about ttc and my loss, etc. And you know what? It&#39;s totally normal.

Somebody
By Gwen Flowers

Somebody said
it was all for the best,
that something was probably wrong.
Somebody said
it was meant to be,
different verse,
same miserable song.
Somebody said,
”You can have another!”
As if that would make it alright.
Somebody said
”It was not a real child.”
Somebody’s not very bright.
Somebody thinks it is helpful
to say when grieving should end.
Somebody shows their true colors.
Somebody isn’t a friend.
But somebody said, “I’m sorry.”
And sat quietly by my side.
And somebody shared my sorrow
and held my hand when I cried.
And somebody always listened
and called my lost baby by name.
And somebody understood
that I’d never again be the same.

I think being worried about your health and future pregnancies is a good reason to make an appointment in a couple of weeks, even if it isn't strictly necessary from your midwife's perspective.

I've had seven miscarriages. Three were between 4 and 5 weeks. My doctor didn't suggest any intervention or monitoring for these losses. My understanding is that the baby is so small at this point that there isn't much to see on an ultrasound. As far as passing the baby, you would expect most of the tissue to just be the endometrial lining, perhaps a bit thicker than during a normal cycle, but not by much. The baby is really so tiny. For me, the bleeding was a little heavier than my normal period, but not so out of the range of normal. I also didn't have really have any more cramping than normal. Of course, it's still such a heartbreak - take all the time you need to grieve, you lost a child and it's horrible.

I've also had 3 losses between 7 and 9 weeks. For these, I did go in a few weeks after starting to miscarry to check that everything had passed (normally about 2 weeks after bleeding started). One of the losses was a missed miscarriage and we used misoprostol to start the process - for that one, my doctor really insisted on seeing me. For the other  two, I mostly went for my own peace of mind. If you're counting, this is 6 total, our 7th loss was in the 2nd trimester. I had  a D&E to deliver the baby's remains. For that one, I would have typically had one ultrasound about a week later to check everything had passed, if that gives you some perspective on what monitoring is normal. I ended up having more because I was in a lot of pain due to a complication. Pain and signs of infection are reasons to always reasons to call your doctor.

Anyway, I think it's just fine to make an appointment for your own peace of mind. It is so helpful to have supportive and reassuring medical care and sometimes that TLC is exactly what we need. It's also a good time to ask any questions you have about any care you want in future pregnancies.

And I didn&#39;t have to take misprostol and have surgery when my grandma was dying. </p>

> I'm only 28, but I know that after 3 losses, there's a higher chance that it will never work.

After three losses, there is about an 60-70% chance that the next pregnancy will be successful (that's just the next pregnancy, not any pregnancy ever, which means the chance of eventually having a baby is higher). They define recurrent loss as three miscarriages or more. One of the reasons why doctors are so reticent to provide much treatment for women who miscarry over and over is that the prognosis of a future pregnancy working out without doing anything is actually very high. Of course, abstract statistics aren't always very useful, and it's hard to feel anything, but -- from a statistical perspective -- you shouldn't think that having three miscarriages means you'll never carry to term. Surprisingly enough, after one miscarriage, your chance of having a living baby eventually is actually higher than someone who's never tried.

Another interesting statistical fact is that even if you have more than three losses, your chances are still actually quite good. Your chance after seven losses of the next pregnancy working out are above 50% and the probability settles somewhere around there, meaning that even after 8 losses, the chance the next pregnancy will work out is greater than 50.

That being said, you have a great chance without treatment, but you'll probably have a better change if you see an RE or OB. In particular, I believe that certain insulin-controlling drugs are supposed to lower the miscarriage rate in women with PCOS.

Again, so sorry for your losses. This is a very hard situation to bear.  ",[],,t1_dtaewaw,,0,,False,"<div class=""md""><p>I am sorry for your loss.</p>

I had a missed miscarriage found at 8+4, measuring 6+5 at the end of September. I was so terrified of loss, and it was like all of my fears crushed us and came true. 

We took a cycle off, then started trying and got pregnant again the second cycle trying. I spent the first two weeks remarkably even.

We scheduled an early ultrasound because of the previous loss, and were nervous wrecks all before it. I couldn’t see it going any other way but badly. At the ultrasound, I was 6+3, but measured 6+5 with a heartbeat of 144, implanted at the top of my uterus. We were elated, called our families, etc. 

Our second ultrasound is today, and I am so incredibly afraid. I am 8+1 today, and I really do not want a repeat of our previous 8 week ultrasound.

I had a TFMR at 20 weeks November 17th. My baby boy had an Omphalocele with many other defects. Abdominal wall defect, heart defect, short limbs, one arm was missing bones, kidneys not working properly, hands were turned inward, small jaw and his growth was about 2 weeks behind over all.  I am young (23), my boyfriend is 30 and this was our first pregnancy. Some of the placenta was sent away for testing but we have not yet heard back. However the genetic counsellor and doctors have said this was probably just a case of bad luck. 

I was told by the OB who did my D&E that we could get pregnant about 2 weeks after the procedure and there was no need to wait for a cycle if we wanted to try again. She said they usually say to wait a cycle for dating purposes. However my OB that dealt with me during my pregnancy said to wait 3 months. 

I have had 2 periods since my D&E in November and my boyfriend and I are already trying again. So we haven't waited the 3 months but I feel physically and emotionally ready to try again. And I'd like to be pregnant by my due date (April), but I know that may not happen. But definitely will not happen if we don't try!

I would say to try again when you feel ready to try again. If your body is ready to get pregnant again, it will.  The hardest part for me is the risk of *not* getting pregnant and stressing over it, but that risk is always there. You know your body best so if you feel ready to try again, I'd say go for it.

I had - what I now know was - a chemical pregnancy a couple of weeks ago. I was seen several times during the course of figuring out what was going on by a doctor who is not my regular person but a part of the OB team. I was seen for an initial exam and a blood draw, returned for a sonogram and another blood draw, and then a final appt for another blood drawn. The only time the doctor really spoke to me was at the initial exam. The day of the sonogram I thought I was going to actually have an appt with her, but instead she spoke with me in the hallway about what she saw in the US, which was that it was ""too early to tell"" and ""inconclusive"" and I should plan to come back the following week for another US and blood draw. Following the results of that second blood drawn which showed my levels had dropped significantly, I was able to cancel the second US and come in for that last blood draw. Once again only saw the phlebotomist and got a phone call the next day saying I was back down to 0. That was it. No one asked how I was, or told me what they thought happened, or provided any reassurances or anything. 

Over the last few weeks I got progressively more ticked off and finally decided to contact my regular doctor and ask if what I experience in terms of care was ""normal."" The practice I go to has one of those portal systems, so I emailed her through there with a synopsis yesterday afternoon. I was super surprised that she personally called me this morning. We spoke for about 15 minutes regarding what she thought happened, what that meant, outlook for trying again, and answered some questions I had about OTC migraine treatment. She also apologized that no one had contacted me and that the treatment I received was not normal. 

I feel super relieved after that, she said my outlook for conceiving again is very good and once I've had a period we can try again. I am very non-confrontational so I especially glad I spoke up.

<p>I&#39;m only 9 weeks and sometimes I manage to forget that I&#39;m pregnant and get a reprieve from the anxiety. I dread being big and uncomfortable, feeling movement, things that remind me to worry.</p>

This is a different baby and he is equally deserving of your love but it’s okay if you can’t do that right now. If you are able to, start looking through boy’s clothes online. Looking at girl’s things brought me around that I was actually excited. </p>

<p>Also congrats on the cervix length! </p>

<p>A very good friend of mine is unexpectedly pregnant. She found a few days ago. She&#39;s almost 33 and has PCOS and wasn&#39;t sure sure would ever have kids, so I really want to be happy and excited for her. But up until she found out she was still smoking cigarettes and had a very unhealthy lifestyle and has only been dating the guy for two months. I have a really hard time with people who weren&#39;t trying and aren&#39;t well- prepared. I feel like I&#39;ve gone through so much pain and suffering and effort to get this far and other people it just happens. It&#39;s unfair.</p>

I thankfully still feel pretty good except for the nonstop heartburn. My anxiety is still rearing it’s ugly head and I feel worried and nervous about nothing and everything at the same time. For example, on Saturday I drank about 40oz of decaf lemon iced tea crystal light (it just tasted so good and refreshing) but then started worrying about if I gave myself aspartame poisoning and crazy brain thinking about what have I done.

I had a meeting with my boss yesterday to talk about my transition out at work for my leave. She’s super supportive (just put through a promotion and 15% raise for me to go in affect before my leave so yay extra money) and I’m glad work is the least of my worries. </p>

TW: scary loss dream 

Nerves hit me last night and caused me to have the worst dream I think I've ever had in my life (you know, one of those terrible miscarriage dreams). This time in the dream I could see my baby after it came out and had to tell my husband that I miscarried. I watched him cry and say ""No, no, no..."" All I could think of in the dream was ""why did it have to happen on the day of our scan?"" 

I woke myself up shortly after the disturbing image of the love of my life breaking down in tears, thank goodness. Luckily my husband was hole and I could just roll over and be comforted. Couldn't fall back asleep until I felt the baby move which thankfully didn't take too long. ♥️

It's strange how you can feel so good for so long about the way things are going and then grief from a loss will just smack you in the face with it's big ugly hand. While this was a horrible dream it's only been one of 5 dreams I've had this pregnancy regarding loss. I don't have PTSD or depression and haven't know personally anyone to have PTSD.  I've heard it can consist of frequent dreams reminding you of the trauma; I could not imagine having that happen over and over again. Mental torture. I immediately thought of other loss moms with stories way worse than a 6 week miscarriage and my heart just breaks and go out to all of you. You are so strong and I am amazed by each of you. ♥️💙


----

<p>TW: scary loss dream </p>

<p>Nerves hit me last night and caused me to have the worst dream I think I&#39;ve ever had in my life (you know, one of those terrible miscarriage dreams). This time in the dream I could see my baby after it came out and had to tell my husband that I miscarried. I watched him cry and say &quot;No, no, no...&quot; All I could think of in the dream was &quot;why did it have to happen on the day of our scan?&quot; </p>

<p>I woke myself up shortly after the disturbing image of the love of my life breaking down in tears, thank goodness. Luckily my husband was hole and I could just roll over and be comforted. Couldn&#39;t fall back asleep until I felt the baby move which thankfully didn&#39;t take too long. ♥️</p>

<p>It&#39;s strange how you can feel so good for so long about the way things are going and then grief from a loss will just smack you in the face with it&#39;s big ugly hand. While this was a horrible dream it&#39;s only been one of 5 dreams I&#39;ve had this pregnancy regarding loss. I don&#39;t have PTSD or depression and haven&#39;t know personally anyone to have PTSD.  I&#39;ve heard it can consist of frequent dreams reminding you of the trauma; I could not imagine having that happen over and over again. Mental torture. I immediately thought of other loss moms with stories way worse than a 6 week miscarriage and my heart just breaks and go out to all of you. You are so strong and I am amazed by each of you. ♥️💙</p>

I was quite wary of a D&C for the potential risks and ""unnaturalness"" but my doctor was insistent. She actually doesn't prescribe the pill past seven weeks because she considers it too much development to pass by then.

My sister in law had seen a heartbeat and said waking up after her D&C was so hard, because at least before then the baby had been with her and then it was gone. I know she would recommend it too; she is the first to admit how much she hates blood and pain. However, other women believe miscarrying at home gave them more peace and closure.

Guess this is the part where I freak out. My baby is not super active in general and the past 2 days, I've noticed even less so. Typically when I lay on my side, baby kicks or squirms so I switch sides. Well baby wasn't doing that. I spend hours agonizing. even listening to the doppler only gives me a very temporary peace of mind.

So I rang my doc to hear heartbeat (cause my concern is baby is in distress despite hearing h/b on doppler) and I went in and h/b was 157-160. While waiting, baby started having flutters and doc said he heard lots of movement / ""swoosh"" sounds. Viability isn't til 24 weeks, next week.

So. How does one relax? Is it even possible after a full-term loss at 39+4? I have no clue how I will manage but it affects my sleep, how I feel during the day and I am constantly worrying whether my baby is alive/going to be ok.

Will have another scan in 2 weeks then be referred out to an MFM.

<p>Will have another scan in 2 weeks then be referred out to an MFM.</p>

<p>I enjoyed my first pregnancy so much. I am sad this one is such a very different experience and one I spend so paranoid. I see baby clothes and want to buy them but don&#39;t because I remember what happened. </p>

<p>I just want to know my baby is going to make it, be healthy, and come home with me, alive from the hospital.</p>

I was a candidate for a cervical cerclage after losing my daughter due to an Incompetent Cervix at 23 weeks. They determined that my cervix failed and put me into pre-term labor. The procedure was, looking back, not as bad as I had thought. The anticipation was worse than the actual day. I was panicked because you’re awake for the procedure and my husband couldn’t be with me. I was given an epidural / spinal block and then shortly after they started. My MFM performed the procedure with my OB as an assist. You don’t feel any pain - but you can feel some tugging and pressure. The whole thing (including the time for the epidural) took about an hour - then I was moved to recovery. I was allowed some IV meds during recovery that helped with the cramping.  I was in recovery until I was able to walk by myself to the restroom and pee. Once that happened I was released. The pain afterwards was intense for the first day and a half or so - they will give you pain meds if you want but I only took Tylenol. It felt like very intense period cramps - and a lot of pressure in your lower abdomen. I also took it really easy the day of the procedure and the two days after - if my memory serves I was back to work on Monday and doing ok (procedure was early on a Friday morning). 

As for follow up - I had to go see my MFM every four weeks. He originally said every two weeks but I never went to the more frequent schedule. They check how it’s holding up by vaginal ultrasounds where they measure the length of the cervix and he position of the cerclage. They are able to tell if it’s moved at all. They also put me on weekly progesterone injections. Not sure they’d do the same with you - the injections work in tandem with the cerclage for those with history of a weak cervix. The cerclage is typically removed between 36-37 weeks so you can go into labor naturally once you’re technically full term (mine is not being removed as baby is breech so I’m scheduled for a c-section at which time the cerclage will be removed).

I wish it was so I could just change doctors and be guaranteed a better experience! The hospital's anesthesiologist was the one who ignored my doctor's instructions. My doctor was angry when she discovered that  ~15 minutes before the procedure. Then the anesthesiologist gave  me a standard dose of something and I obviously had a very bad reaction. I don't think that's his fault, but I do blame him for ignoring that I was distressed. I was crying and told him that it wasn't working, but he ignored me and told my husband and mother that I wasn't terrified, it was just ""lowered inhibitions"" from the medication and that I wouldn't remember. He didn't offer me any comfort at all. My doctor was horrified at how that was handled. She must have read everyone the riot act afterwards because I was assigned wonderful nurses and they broke a bunch of policies to get my husband beside me as soon as my eyes opened (normally they make you wait until they move you to the second recovery room). She also wrote a long letter of complaint to the hospital within 24 hours, before she knew that the amnesia hadn't worked and I remembered a lot of it. So, I had a horrible, probably freak, experience but I am pretty impressed with my OB.

Definitely ask your doctor what would be involved in the procedure before making a decision. It's hard to compare cytotec and a D&C if you don't know what both would involve. I believe most D&C's use general anesthesia (I think it's called ""MAC,"" you're asleep but still breathing on your own) since the procedure causes intense cramping and pain that you wouldn't want to be awake for. Your doctor might recommend medication or laminar to dilate the cervix beforehand too (to make it easier to insert instruments and reduce the risk of cervical injury). I found that very painful and it caused a lot of cramping in the 24 hours before hand. Might not need that for an earlier loss though? I know a lot of women have good experiences with D&Cs and D&Es, so I hope I'm not scaring you out of this :\ There's just no easy way to miscarry and there's always a chance that things will go wrong.

Try not to blame yourself. There's often no rhyme or reason to loss. My husband and I have lost seven babies, first and second trimester, and we don't have any answers - specialist after specialist agrees that I'm in perfect health.

My doctor helps a clinic in a 3rd world country every year and most of the women give birth to living babies, despite issues with water quality, extreme poverty, poor nutrition, etc. Medicine just can't explain everything.

I had a missed miscarriage with cytotec and a 2nd trimester loss with a D&E, which is somewhat similar to a D&C. 

My experience with cytotec was pretty good, given the circumstances. I had lost the baby at 8 weeks, but was pregnant until ~10. I appreciated that it was at home, where I felt more comfortable. There was heavy cramping, really a mini-labor, but the discomfort was manageable with prescription ibuprofen, hot packs, hot showers, pressure on my lower back, etc. I know some doctors prescribe narcotics, but I wasn't offered them and I didn't need them. There was only one day of really heavy bleeding, the rest was more similar to a heavy period. There were a couple hours when the bleeding was really heavy and I passed the gestational sac and baby, which we were able to identify.

My experience with the D&E was very, very bad. Feel free to skip the next paragraph if you want to stick to good experiences -

Possibly upsetting description of what went wrong: My doctor had instructed the anesthesiologist to give me something for anxiety when I first checked in, but that didn't happen and I was left crying in the pre-op room for 3+ hours. Then, when I finally was given medication that was supposed to cause relaxation and amnesia (so I wouldn't remember being taken to the operating room, positioned, etc before being given the heavier anesthesia), it caused confusion and panic - and unfortunately the promised amnesia didn't work either, so I remember way more than I would like. After all of that, I had complications afterwards. I didn't have retained tissue (they confirmed), but after the procedure I had continued to bleed more than expected. This caused giant clots to form. We realized this about 72 hours afterwards, because I was in way more pain than I should have been. The solution was medication that causes the uterus to cramp which stops the bleeding and pushes the clots out. So basically, 4 days after the D&E, I got to feel all the misery of labor while pushing fist sized clots out. 

So, the D&E was an absolute nightmare. Knowing what we do now, I'd avoid a D&C/D&E if I had any other option (especially since having one bad reaction to anesthesia makes it more likely to happen again in the future?). But my experience was also rare and many women have good experiences with D&Cs. It's a hard decision because many women have good experiences with both, but there's also a chance that you'll have issues with both.

At about 7 weeks out, people here told me to tell my Ob, so I did, and they had me get blood tests. We did this for like, 3 weeks, and the level did decrease but wasn't going away, and I hadn't had my period yet still, so finally, 10.5 weeks after my D&C, I got an ultrasound that showed I still had some placenta that was still connected to blood flow.

So then my ob offered to do a second D&C, and I didn't realize that this was a high risk situation for scarring, so I had it it done. Then the wait began for my period again. Over a month went by, nothing. I called my ob, she prescribed provera/progesterone. I only did 5 days instead of 10, and still no bleed. Finally, over two months since the second D&C, and I got a period. But a very light period, which was weird because before my mirena (I went straight from mirena to pregnant), I used to have heavy periods.

At this point, I had switched to a midwife, and she said it's fine, and that periods change after miscarriage. 3 or 4 more periods went by, still light, still not getting pregnant, and I was starting to notice that I was getting pretty bad cramps with my period too, and I was worrying more and more that maybe I had scarring. I called the midwife practice two more times in this interim. First person told me to wait till December, but second person, when I mentioned the pain, referred me to a new ob. That ob noticed that in the report for my second D&C, even though she said she was just going to do suction (with ultrasound guidance this time; it blows my mind that ultrasound guidance isn't standard for all D&Cs), she actually used curettage. So she ordered a saline ultrasound. But they couldn't get the catheter in to do the saline part. Sometimes they just can't get through the cervix, but sometimes that means there's scarring.

So then I got referred to an RE, and they did an HSG, which showed that I had a tiny portion of my uterus just above the cervix opened (which was how I was still having periods) but the rest of it was blocked. :(

So miscarriage discovered late January, saline ultrasound in October, and HSG was in November. >< In December, the next February and April, I had hysteroscopies to remove the scarring (flew to a specialist in LA that does a lot of these). My uterus still isn't quite normal (I'm very much a rarer case though; many people just do one hysteroscopy and then get pregnant naturally after), but my local RE thinks it's good enough. Tried naturally for five cycles, femara & timed intercourse for two (one of those I had extra estrogen before ovulation to try to thicken my lining, which has remained thin these days; I'm usually below 6mm on my own), and now I'm moving on to IVF to see if we can get better control over making my uterus a receptive environment again.

I am now 33 weeks pregnant with my rainbow baby.  I conceived him after one round of clomid (so I could ovulate like a normal person and not every 4 months) 8 months after my miscarriage.  I'm not going to lie and say it has been rainbows and sunshine this pregnancy.  I have been filled with a lot of anxiety about another loss, complications and a whole new hell.  I feel like my miscarriage robbed me of a chance to be a ""unicorn"" about everything.  I am hopeful that I get to take this baby home but know that nothing is a guarantee.  I am trying to enjoy and savor every moment possible though.

Things like tissues for crying... nice soft ones. Maybe order some from amazon to get sent to her. 

Or something for her boobs once her milk comes in. It'll physically and emotionally hurt. So something like ice packs for breastfeeding, or even providing info about how to help her milk stop... Like applying cold cabbage leaves to her boobs. Looking up this info on this after losing a child is horrible because the info always assumes the baby lived.

A bottle of wine.

A nice soft robe - I wore a black tank top, black sleepy pants, and a black  robe for like a month straight. Maternity clothes made me sad, but I couldn't fit into anything else. Shopping gave me anxiety for a while afterwards.

Hope this helps

I actually had so many people bringing me food after my stillbirth that I had to throw most of it out because it was just too much. Here&#39;s some things that helped me:</p>

<p>Things like tissues for crying... nice soft ones. Maybe order some from amazon to get sent to her. </p>

<p>Or something for her boobs once her milk comes in. It&#39;ll physically and emotionally hurt. So something like ice packs for breastfeeding, or even providing info about how to help her milk stop... Like applying cold cabbage leaves to her boobs. Looking up this info on this after losing a child is horrible because the info always assumes the baby lived. Even a gift certificate for a new bra could be nice.</p>

I had an ultrasound with no heartbeat at 10 weeks last July. It really sucks. Let yourself cry. Talk about it with your partner (even if you repeat yourself a lot).

I bled for 5 weeks after taking misoprostol and I don't wish that on anyone. It felt like we would never be able to try again.

I’m also a former August bumper. I’m sorry you have to be here and not there. 

So there are SO MANY success stories post-MC. Beyoncé. My mom. My doula. Her daughter-in-law. And on and on and on.  This is a terrible but very common occurrence. One MC doesn’t increase your chances of a second, and is utterly normal, if devastating. 

But here’s my unsolicited advice. After my first MC I got VERY attached to the “I’ll get pregnant again right away and everything will be fine narrative” and it made my post-MC journey so much harder. Every cycle crushed me. I kept obsessing. My distant friend had written publicly about her MC and had gone on to have a beautiful baby and I kept trying to figure out how long it took her to get pregnant again and thinking “ok we have to come within that window”. I was obsessed with dates: getting pregnant on our trip in NYC. Getting pregnant before the anniversary of our first date. Getting pregnant before my due date. It made it really hard emotionally to cope. 

What I’ve learned and am trying to live is that pregnancy (and parenting after that) is a process that you have almost no control over. Other people’s stories hold a ton of hope, but they can’t predict your future. Nothing can. I have found comfort in grieving without judgment of myself, without deadlines and without putting a lot of stock in a particular thing happening in the future. 

I believe in my heart that my husband and I will have a baby. I now know that road looks nothing like I could have predicted and that I can’t predict (or will or wish or force) what will happen next. I’m trying to hold that truth with an open hand, and accept this moment for what it is.  Please know that I fail to succeed in this project every day, and that I’m not enlightened or calm or accepting most of the time. I’m just trying. 

I wish you so much peace and love. ",[],,t1_dsxdbdz,False,0,[],False,"<div class=""md""><p>Hey - I’m so sorry. I’m also a former August bumper. I’m sorry you have to be here and not there. </p>

<p>So there are SO MANY success stories post-MC. Beyoncé. My mom. My doula. Her daughter-in-law. And on and on and on.  This is a terrible but very common occurrence. One MC doesn’t increase your chances of a second, and is utterly normal, if devastating. </p>

<p>But here’s my unsolicited advice. After my first MC I got VERY attached to the “I’ll get pregnant again right away and everything will be fine narrative” and it made my post-MC journey so much harder. Every cycle crushed me. I kept obsessing. My distant friend had written publicly about her MC and had gone on to have a beautiful baby and I kept trying to figure out how long it took her to get pregnant again and thinking “ok we have to come within that window”. I was obsessed with dates: getting pregnant on our trip in NYC. Getting pregnant before the anniversary of our first date. Getting pregnant before my due date. It made it really hard emotionally to cope. </p>

<p>What I’ve learned and am trying to live is that pregnancy (and parenting after that) is a process that you have almost no control over. Other people’s stories hold a ton of hope, but they can’t predict your future. Nothing can. I have found comfort in grieving without judgment of myself, without deadlines and without putting a lot of stock in a particular thing happening in the future. </p>

<p>I believe in my heart that my husband and I will have a baby. I now know that road looks nothing like I could have predicted and that I can’t predict (or will or wish or force) what will happen next. I’m trying to hold that truth with an open hand, and accept this moment for what it is.  Please know that I fail to succeed in this project every day, and that I’m not enlightened or calm or accepting most of the time. I’m just trying. </p>

<p>I wish you so much peace and love. </p>

Know that she is going through an emotional hell now and this journey is very isolating and she will grieve for the rest of her life. It's a lifelong sentence of pain when your child dies.

I’m so sorry to hear about your friend’s loss. She likely needs you now more than ever—loss is the loneliest experience of my entire life, and I’ve been through some rough stuff! I bet she feels very lonely.

The most helpful thing for us immediately after our loss was having friends and family bring us food—mostly home cooked meals, but also groceries for when we felt like cooking, and after the casseroles stopped coming, it was helpful to have canned soup and such. Facing real life is a huge struggle after loss; my husband and I went to the store a week after my surgery and walked out almost immediately. We’d rather order takeout than make decisions in the dairy aisle. It is so overwhelming to be in those ordinary life situations when experiencing something extraordinary. Have some healthy groceries sent to her home (Amazon fresh or whatever equivalent) along with some cozy comfy things to pamper her, I really enjoyed bath bombs and fancy soaps, and also bought myself the most comfy oversized robe, it’s black (blood doesn’t show) and just huge and so soft. I wore it all day, on days when I just couldn’t do anything.

This is probably obvious, but please don’t talk about your pregnancy with her, even in passing, and even if she asks. I feel obligated to ask after pregnant women, out of politeness, but it’s way too painful to hear about it. She might be similarly polite, or just out of habit may ask how you’re doing, as I imagine you’ve been experiencing pregnancy together throughout. She likely doesn’t actually want to know, so try to steer the conversation to easier, less emotionally charged topics. Let her talk about her loss, don’t change the subject if it gets uncomfortable for you. Supporting her may be one of the more difficult things you’ve done, considering that you’re pregnant, but she likely needs your support so much. 

Finally, don’t wait for her to reach out to you. People have different views on this, and it depends on your relationship, but those closest to me now are the ones who didn’t let me isolate myself after our loss—the ones who kept texting me and messaging me, even when I wanted to withdraw, they are now my tribe. Some friends sent me cute cat photos all day to distract me; my stepmother in law encouraged me via text to get out of bed literally every morning for a few weeks after our loss. I told pretty much everyone to give me space, and those who didn’t listen, those are my people now.

I do this with pretty much everything in my life - following signs and wonders to the ends of the earth. Last month I thought for sure was my month because then the baby would be born around my birthday and it was the solstice and I had finally told someone close about my miscarriage and I was so sure this symbolic barrier was the only thing holding me back from conceiving again. It wasn't my month.  

It seems I am my most superstitious, my most ""psychic,"" my most desperate for synchronicity when I'm the most hurt. Honestly it's no different from women seeing that second line on their test when no one else can or symptom obsessing - we want so damn badly to believe that this is happening, that this is something that is indeed for us, that we'll look for confirmation anywhere that will give it. Just because it will come, though, doesn't mean it's right or true.

For me, the most helpful thing is to look back at other times in my life when I've used superstition as a crutch, and to then examine how they actually turned out. For example, I tend to get superstitious when I'm stressed out in matters of love. How many times have I seen some weird synchronicity between me and someone else and used it as some fucked up validation that what I was pursuing was right? A billion times. For example, for years I was in love with this boy. We never dated - he said he would just hurt me - but we were extremely close. I spent almost all of my time analyzing him. Every morning we'd wake up and compare our dreams, we'd chronicle each and every coincidence. We'd have some freaky shit happen to us. It made me feel special, close to him, important. But honestly all of this was probably happening because I was bending myself so hard to be like him, to be absolutely absorbed in him. When you do the same things as one another all day long, your dreams might turn out similar, you might start noticing the same things. I spent so long obsessing over him psychically. Every synchronicity was a beacon of hope and a reassurance that even though I wasn't what he liked physically, I was his be all, end all mentally and that someday, maybe in another life, my day would come. And then I met my husband and he was fucking amazing and 10 years of tarot cards, dream interpretation, and synchronicity flew to shit. It never meant anything at all. And that's alright. 

It's very hard for me because my family is very spiritual and superstitious and I can't help but see the beauty in these methods of interpreting and sorting the universe. I still think there's a place for them, but I try not to partake when I'm depressed. I know I'll just get sucked in. I try to instead focus on things I know will absolutely, scientifically improve my chances: eating better, working out, staying on top of my vitamins, etc. 

I think it's human nature to turn to systems of belief like this when we're hurt - it makes it seem like we're not alone, like maybe there's a whole undercurrent rooting for us. I don't mean to be insensitive, but sometimes it helps me to think about other peoples rituals and beliefs that get them through that mean absolutely nothing to me. They came from that same wellspring of hopelessness and not knowing, I think, and I see them as pretty daft... So...

I'm still terrified of another D&E, but my doctor has promised that if I ever need surgery in the future, I will be referred to a more senior anesthesiologist.

My situation is quite different in that my husband and I only started TTC last year.  I also never had much of an burning desire to be a mother, so if you had really wanted to be a mother of 2 (or more) children, I can see how you are feeling confused now.

Husband and I apparently have no problems *getting* pregnant, but have a hard time *staying* pregnant.  I lost 5 pregnancies (four at 5 weeks and earlier, one at 8 weeks) and all testing done thus far suggested nothing was wrong and that it was probably just back-to-back bad luck.  We're nearing the end of week 11 of our 6th pregnancy, and if it ends in another MC, I don't know if I want to try again.  Our one-year journey doesn't compare at all to yours or many of the other couples in here who have been trying for years or who had late term losses, but I'll be 36 this year, and I don't want to put yet another year of my life on hold trying for a baby that may never happen.  All the peeing on sticks, the appointments where I get a wand shoved up my vagina, the waiting between appointments, the hoping that I don't start bleeding, the never-ending blood tests, the over-analysis of every symptom even though I know symptoms don't really mean anything, the fear of eating sashimi (even though technically it should be safe so long as I go to a reputable restaurant), the utter lack of alcohol.

<p>My situation is quite different in that my husband and I only started TTC last year.  I also never had much of an burning desire to be a mother, so if you had really wanted to be a mother of 2 (or more) children, I can see how you are feeling confused now.</p>

<p>Husband and I apparently have no problems <em>getting</em> pregnant, but have a hard time <em>staying</em> pregnant.  I lost 5 pregnancies (four at 5 weeks and earlier, one at 8 weeks) and all testing done thus far suggested nothing was wrong and that it was probably just back-to-back bad luck.  We&#39;re nearing the end of week 11 of our 6th pregnancy, and if it ends in another MC, I don&#39;t know if I want to try again.  Our one-year journey doesn&#39;t compare at all to yours or many of the other couples in here who have been trying for years or who had late term losses, but I&#39;ll be 36 this year, and I don&#39;t want to put yet another year of my life on hold trying for a baby that may never happen.  All the peeing on sticks, the appointments where I get a wand shoved up my vagina, the waiting between appointments, the hoping that I don&#39;t start bleeding, the never-ending blood tests, the over-analysis of every symptom even though I know symptoms don&#39;t really mean anything, the fear of eating sashimi (even though technically it should be safe so long as I go to a reputable restaurant), the utter lack of alcohol.</p>

I guess the other inheritable possibilities are thrombophilias -- blood clotting. These can either be genetic or acquired. Genetic means you have a particular mutation that makes you more susceptible. Acquired means you have acquired a condition after birth (not through doing anything, simply bad luck). The genetic ones are obviously inheritable. The acquired ones occur spontaneously, but there appears to be a genetic connection as well.

The common inherited thrombophilias they test for (certainly not a complete list) are Factor V Leiden, PAI 4g/5g, Prothrombin G20210A, and MTHFR (the homozygous or compound heterozygous kind). The most common acquired thrombophilia is anti-phospholipid syndrome, and the tests for this are called the Lupus Anticoagulant panel (may be labeled as Dilute Russell's Viper Venom Time and PTT-LA), Anticardiolipin antibodies, and anti-beta-2-glycoprotein-1 antibodies. I imagine you've been tested for these, but it's worth a check.

Another heritable condition could be hashimoto's thyroiditis. This is a state where the body makes antibodies to your thyroid gland. This causes your thyroid gland to not produce enough thyroid hormone, which is necessary to live. Thyroid hormone requirements rise drastically during pregnancy. The tests for this would be TSH, Free T4, Free T3, anti-TPO antibody, anti-TG antibody. Even if your thyroid is functioning normally, if the antibody numbers are high, you have a higher risk for miscarriage and infertility. They do not know why this is the case, but multiple studies have shown it to be true. There are several things you can do to lower your antibody titre. You may also have non-immune hypothyroidism. Again, a baby needs its mothers thyroid hormones to grow, so during pregnancy you need to make enough thyroid hormone for two. If your TSH is high, or T4 or T3 are low, then you may be hypothyroid. Luckily, this is easily remedied by a once-a-day thyroid supplement. You may have been tested for some of these, but in my experience (I have hashimoto's, but my wife does not) doctors are incredibly bad at interpreting thyroid results. The maximum TSH for a pregnant woman is 2.5, and that's really on the high end. The American Pregnancy Association says it should be below 2, but many doctors won't treat it unless it's above 5. Moreover, you can be hypothyroid with a normal TSH, which is why it's necessary to test for the T4 and T3 numbers, which few doctors do.

There are some hormonal possibilities as well, but you honestly wouldn't expect these to cause such a high rate of loss. Nevertheless, prolactin and progesterone are probably the biggest two. Of these, high prolactin is probably more strongly linked with miscarriage. Personally, our experience is that after our first miscarriage, my wife's prolactin was elevated. We believe this is what caused our three chemical pregnancies, because once she took medication to lower it, those stopped (but we got stuck with 'regular' miscarriages, so it's hardly a cure-all). Again, after this last pregnancy, her prolactin is elevated again, but we know what to do this time. The connection between miscarriage and low progesterone is tenuous in my opinion, but others swear by it. My wife's progesterone always shows up as on the low end in cycle's she's not pregnant, but normalizes whenever she is pregnant. It actually runs slightly high. We've tried supplementing just in case, and it works in the sense that it makes her progesterone go even higher, but we've not noticed *any* difference in the length of pregnancy between pregnancies where we've supplemented and pregnancies we did not.

As tathougies suggested, a karyotype test could be helpful, especially if your mother had a similar history of unexplained loss. Other possibilities include physical issues such as endometriosis or fibroid tumors, which can sometimes be asymptomatic until you're trying to get pregnant (like they might not be causing any noticeable pain or cycle issues, but could be interfering with implantation or causing other early pregnancy problems). There is also a series of blood tests that are sometimes collectively called a ""repeat loss panel"" that checks for things like antibodies or mutations such as MTHFR that could cause problems in early pregnancy. If you search that term on this sub, you should be a able to find a few posts with some details about what's included in that panel of tests.

After 3 losses, you should be able to get a referral to an OB/GYN or even an RE for some testing, if you choose to do so. You may need to advocate for yourself, since unfortunately you are likely to get ""you're young, you have time!"" from some doctors, but don't let them tell you no - you clearly have reason to suspect something isn't right, and it's completely reasonable to want to look for answers now instead of waiting some arbitrary amount of time.

I hope you are able to get some answers and eventually your rainbow! <3

ETA: If you do end up deciding to pursue additional testing, you might also be interested in r/stilltrying - it's a sub for folks who have been TTC for a while and are often in the early stages of seeing an RE to explore why it's not working out.

You may need to advocate for yourself, since unfortunately you are likely to get &quot;you&#39;re young, you have time!&quot; from some doctors, but don&#39;t let them tell you no - you clearly have reason to suspect something isn&#39;t right, and it&#39;s completely reasonable to want to look for answers now instead of waiting some arbitrary amount of time.</p>

<p>I hope you are able to get some answers and eventually your rainbow! &lt;3</p>

<p>ETA: If you do end up deciding to pursue additional testing, you might also be interested in <a href=""/r/stilltrying"">r/stilltrying</a> - it&#39;s a sub for folks who have been TTC for a while and are often in the early stages of seeing an RE to explore why it&#39;s not working out. I was active there while TTC and it&#39;s a very supportive community - not everyone has experienced loss, but there&#39;s lots of info and commiseration on the challenges of TTC that isn&#39;t of the &quot;I did this random thing&quot; sort (like the regular TFAB sub can often be).</p>

We spent a long time crafting a message that would give them all the info to pre-empt their questions— yes, this was a wanted pregnancy; yes, this was safe even so early after a full term pregnancy; yes, our therapist thought this was a good idea; normal symptoms; heightened risk due to history; etc. We also worked to establish some firm boundaries about this pregnancy— we don’t much want to talk about it, all we want is a live baby, but until then we aren’t prepared to assume it will happen like that, and so on.

Everyone, for the most part, responded supportively. There were a couple of tone deaf comments, ranging from benign to maddening. My sister in law emphasized to me that I could come talk to her whenever I wanted about my feelings. A nice sentiment, but I waited until this pregnancy was halfway to complete before sharing the news... clearly I’m not up for talking about it with them. Also, she just had a baby boy two months ago. And she’s never had a loss. She might literally be the last person on earth I would approach to discuss my feelings.

My dad’s response included a message about how my daughter deserves to be a big sister. This one rubbed me the wrong way so hard. She IS a big sister, an amazing one, in ways that most three year olds are never asked to be.

But generally, people acknowledged our desire for privacy where necessary and offered help where they could, and best of all, no one called us weeping, which is exactly what we wanted to avoid by sending out an email with the news, so at least now it’s done.",[],,t1_dsrmp45,False,0,[],False,"<div class=""md""><p>We finally emailed our families over the weekend to let them know I am 18 weeks pregnant. We spent a long time crafting a message that would give them all the info to pre-empt their questions— yes, this was a wanted pregnancy; yes, this was safe even so early after a full term pregnancy; yes, our therapist thought this was a good idea; normal symptoms; heightened risk due to history; etc. We also worked to establish some firm boundaries about this pregnancy— we don’t much want to talk about it, all we want is a live baby, but until then we aren’t prepared to assume it will happen like that, and so on.</p>

<p>Everyone, for the most part, responded supportively. There were a couple of tone deaf comments, ranging from benign to maddening. My sister in law emphasized to me that I could come talk to her whenever I wanted about my feelings. A nice sentiment, but I waited until this pregnancy was halfway to complete before sharing the news... clearly I’m not up for talking about it with them. Also, she just had a baby boy two months ago. And she’s never had a loss. She might literally be the last person on earth I would approach to discuss my feelings.</p>

<p>My dad’s response included a message about how my daughter deserves to be a big sister. This one rubbed me the wrong way so hard. She IS a big sister, an amazing one, in ways that most three year olds are never asked to be. It felt like a disservice to her to ignore that impressive part of her development over the past year, and it felt like another attempt to erase Sam from our family history. I am sure he didn’t mean anything truly harmful by it— he meant she deserves to play with her sibling and have a normal sibling relationship.

I did have a momentary twinge of &quot;I should be over 20 weeks pregnant right now&quot; but it passed and I was able to be happy for them at the party. I did cry a little when I got home, but I was fine as soon as my husband came up to check on me. Also, apparently, my cat gets really worried when I go into the bedroom in the middle of the day now.</p>

Personally, my wife and I are *extremely, extremely* wary of the genetic explanations. First of all, unless you have a dual robertsonian translocation, as you have more and more losses, the chance that *any* were chromosomal slowly go to zero. Second of all, my wife does actually have a chromosomal rearrangement (paracentric inversion on 13), which doctors initially used to dismiss our losses as due to eggs. It wasn't until we had one of our miscarried babies tested (turns out we are conceiving and losing chromosomally normal babies) that doctors have finally laid off of the chromosomal crap.

For us at least, the 'bad egg' explanation (which makes more sense in our case) absolutely wrong

You are 30 years old, so -- to be frank -- the risk of bad eggs is going to be really low, unless you have other risk factors.

Can I ask if you had any symptoms of endometritis (I suspect you didn't, but wanted to check)?  Did your doctor take a sample of your endometrium during your hysteroscopy as a matter of course, or was there a particular reason for it?  Asking because I'm about to undergo a hysteroscopy (suspected polyps) and have read that endometritis appears more frequently in women who have had c-sections, which I have had, and IUD placement/removal, which I've also had--so I had been thinking about bringing it up with my doctor as long as she's in there.  Of course, it's also entirely possible that I'm just desperate for something treatable to be wrong.

Thank you, and fingers crossed for an uneventful pregnancy.  I know pregnancy's not really to be discussed except in the alumni thread, so of course I appreciate the trigger warning, but I always find it comforting to see a story that leads to a happy pregnancy <3 (Sorry, mods, I can erase that part if not allowed).

Hey guys I was wondering if any of you had some advice for me. My stepson lost his brother to stillbirth this summer. His brother was not my biological child but his mother's. My stepson is 9 years old, smart, and had a very very difficult time with the stillbirth. My husband and I have lost 7 pregnancies but my stepson only knows of one of the losses which happened right after we announced to him at 12 weeks. He was sad with my 12 week loss but it definitely was nowhere near the experience of losing his brother. Our loss happened over 3 years ago now so I think part of the reason his reaction was lessened was because of his age and emotional maturity. Anyways... I am currently just over 9 weeks. I have had 5 excellent ultrasounds and I have severe nausea and vomitting that has been impossible to hide. Needless to say my stepson has figured it out. I overjeard him tell his friend on discord last night that he was getting a new brother or sister. 

So... what do I do? I obviously cannot ignore it. Should I talk to him? What do I even say? I feel completely helpless. I can't just ignore it but what if this baby dies too? It wouldn't be a shocker if it did. How freaking terrible for my stepson!! I was thinking I could explain to him that in the first part of pregnancy the body checks to make sure if baby is healthy and if baby is not healthy the pregnancy will not continue while at the same time explaining that isnt what happened with his brother (who was lost to PPROM). Someone tried telling him that his brother was a miscarriage so hes already super confused on language. HELP!?!?

We've done all the hormone panels (progesterone, thyroid, etc), APS tests, genetic clotting tests, carrier screenings. She's had her uterus and ovaries looked at. Everything fine. The only thing that turned up for us is a paracentric inversion on chromosome 13 (a very rare rearrangement), but -- get this -- we've confirmed this is *not* the reason for our second trimester loss, which means we're definitely dealing with something else. Since her chromosomal rearrangement is incredibly rare, we had to see a special geneticist, who basically said that she didn't know if it could increase our risk of miscarriage, but that it definitely did not cause the 16 week loss.

She's done some blood tests while pregnant -- mainly hcg and progesterone, but everything is normal. Her progesterone actually runs on the higher end when pregnant, and the hcg numbers have always doubled fine, until one day they don't. She has pretty bad morning sickness. Not ER-level bad, but definitely noticeable. This is supposed to lower your risk of miscarriage, but we have not noticed this at all. 

Other than my wife's doctor, the MFMs and REs we've gone to have told us that we've done everything, and it's all unexplained. They can't even tell us why our son died at 16 weeks -- he was kicking around one day, with a great heartbeat, everything normal, and his heart just stopped the next day. 

In past pregnancies, we've tried progesterone shots, metformin, baby aspirin, and thyroid supplements (which she's on when not pregnant too). None of these have worked. In fact, our two longest pregnancies(9 and 16 weeks) have been from doing absolutely nothing.

Her doctor has been in practice for decades, and helped many women, and she says that many couples will find no answer, but she believes that empirical treatment is their best bet. In our case, since we've tried a few things, she's pushing for us to try lovenox, which is a blood thinner. Although we can't find any reason for the miscarriages, blood clotting is a known cause and there is excellent evidence that medicine cannot diagnose all causes of blood clots.  Also, every doctor has told us that it is *very* atypical for a morphologically and chromosomally normal baby's heart to stop overnight. This also points towards blood clotting being the issue, but again -- serum testing does not indicate that. My wife is also trying a medication called 'low dose naltrexone', which is supposed to help with auto-immune diseases.

I just had my third loss recently, and I have an RE appointment coming up.  Here's what I've had done.

After the second loss, more careful monitoring of my thyroid levels (I already was borderline hypothyroid, which we knew).  My endocrinologist upped my levothyroxine for me to keep my TSH under 1 while trying to conceive because ""it's better to be a little hyper- than a little hypo- when trying to get pregnant.""  Nothing else after the second loss, as I was assured all was probably normal and we just had shit luck.  

I had a healthy pregnancy after the second loss and was remaining on the higher dose of thyroid medication.  I realize now, after my third loss, that I happened to be on methylfolate rather than folic acid during that pregnancy.

My third loss/fourth pregnancy was recent, another MMC, and I'm still in the midst of figuring out how to proceed.  My OB's office says 3 losses are definitely not to be expected, and they absolutely support further testing.  I couldn't get in with an RE for a month or two, so they will order some basic CD3 tests (FSH, LH, estradiol, and some other ""standard"" stuff), basic clotting (lupus anticoagulant, ANA, something else), and and update of my thyroid as soon as my period returns, which it hasn't yet.  I also asked for MTHFR testing based on my weird hunch about my only to-term pregnancy being while I happened to be taking the methylfolate, so I think they'll do that as well.  During my third and fourth pregnancies, they also began monitoring beta hcg early on, and they rose appropriately.  I was also given progesterone for those two pregnancies basically to make me feel like I was doing something, which I took.  

After my second follow-up ultrasound for this miscarriage, they're sure there's either a polyp or some retained tissue in my uterus, so they've scheduled me for a hysteroscopy/D&C in 10 days.  If it is a polyp, there could be more, I guess, and they ""could certainly"" have affected this most recent pregnancy (after completing my own research it sound like this isn't really very likely, but in cases of recurring miscarriage it's always a possibility I guess).  I go to the RE in a couple weeks and I assume they'll order some further clotting-type tests, but I'm not sure what they would be or if there's anything else.  

Again, I'm so sorry to hear about your losses.  I will certainly update as I get more testing/results and will keep an eye on this thread, because I'm also interested in what other people have had done when.

Even your reaction to your boss seems at the very worst neutral rather than asshole, especially when bitching about pregnancy symptoms to someone you know lost babies is seriously an asshole move. The asshole response would have been, “I hope you lose it, and then you’ll know what symptoms to really complain about,” which I’ll readily admit sounds like thoughts I’ve had before (and of course had to keep to myself). 

We all have negative thoughts. Biting your tongue and keeping this negativity to yourself means that you ARE being gentle with others. The problem comes with dwelling on those negative thoughts (that are now all sorts of bottled up in your head because of all this gentleness and compassion you’ve been showing others) and allowing them to cause you mental distress. To me, that’s where mindfulness comes in. When I start to get into a negative cycle of thoughts, I have to remind myself to acknowledge the thoughts and let them go. If they come back, it’s time to use one of my coping mechanisms to ground myself and bring me back to the moment (works great for panic attacks too). 

My favorite is the earth water air fire EMDR technique. I’m sure google can explain it better. Basically I put my feet on the floor, rock them heel to toe, take stock of my surroundings and know I’m safe. Think earth. Then I take a deep, slow breath, feel it fill my lungs, imagine good energy flowing to my fingers and toes, and take stock of the feelings in my body and spots of tension. Think air. Then gather some saliva and swallow. Focus on releasing the tensions and negative thoughts and centering yourself. Think water. Then repeat a quick mantra. Mine is “the fire of the Lord burns away the sins of the world,” but you’re welcome to make it non-religious. Imagine lights coming on in your head and notice the thoughts are gone (this is where I open my eyes if I’ve had them closed, but I’ve done this while driving many times, so I don’t always close my eyes) and think fire. 

Finally, there’s no harm in allowing yourself the angry glare at the back of that pregnant lady or the frumpy woman with the cute kid.

I can highly recommend Dan Harris’ books, podcast and especially app for exploring this without feeling preached to. It was one of his podcasts where he mentioned that whatever the evidence and voices around you in support of meditation etc, the only way to know if and how it helps is to try it for yourself. </p>

<p>I hope thaf doesn’t sound too preachy. Your feelings of anger and really resonated with me. </p>

I felt the  way you did for a long time and I think it steams from trying to make ourselves fixed too fast. Truth is we aren’t and we need more gentleness then anyone considers. So along with dealing with emotional stress, we have to advocate for ourself. 

Your co-worker who complained to you-that’s a shit situation. But we want to be nice! But being nice comes at emotional distress so I try to be nice to myself. First thing I did when I encountered pregnant women and had to talk to them was say, “ I just lost twins at twenty weeks, so talking about current pregnancy or potential pregnancy isn’t something I can handle right now.  Please don’t ask about trying or adoption, it’s very rude. “  You’d be surprised how understand most people could be when you just lay your cards out. 

Part of me hated it, loathed the fact my girls became some tragic “that could never happen to me” story for others or felt like that by I had to invoke their story so that I could get a break from healthy, alive children in my face. But now I like it, I get to talk about them again and remember. 

I also tried to block out the world with music, tv- anything. The Real housewives and Rupaul saved me. RHONY is a bunch of menopausal drunks who are way more interested in getting slammed than having more kids and RuPaul is very not kid friendly. Most importantly, the reddit communities gave me people to talk about anything that isn’t babies.    

I hope you find something that you can focus on, and know you aren’t weak or bad because you feel bitter.

<p>I have felt pretty good the past few days after seeing baby at the ultrasound. Feeling her move nightly has been sooo good for my worries. (Just typing that makes me worried I&#39;ll jinx things and she won&#39;t move.) </p>

<p>I also got out my maternity shirts finally after resisting for a long time. My belly is just LARGE already. (I can&#39;t believe this is the 5th time I&#39;ve made it halfway through pregnancy. It&#39;s so crazy when I think about how much time I&#39;ve spent pregnant.)</p>

<p>In unrelated new, I had a dentist appointment this week (which I always dread thanks to all the pregnancy talk - last pregnancy she was like &quot;Next time I see you, you&#39;ll be a mom to three!&quot; And I was like &quot;I hope...&quot; And she goes, &quot;Yeah let&#39;s hope it&#39;s not twins LOL&quot; -_-). This time, the hygienist was like &quot;You were pregnant in 2016 and are now pregnant again? How old is your little one!?&quot;</p>

<p>I was like &quot;Well, my last two babies died, so...&quot; </p>

<p>I wish I could have them put in my file &quot;Do not make small talk about pregnancy with this patient.&quot; Goodness. </p>

When I had my full term stillbirth, my midwife told me that I just needed to wait one cycle to become pregnant again. This was more for dating reasons than anything else, so if you know your cycles are extraordinarily long and irregular then there may be no harm in trying without waiting for your first postpartum period as long as you are cleared for sex.

My own personal experience: I got my first postpartum period six weeks after delivery. I am fairly certain I did not ovulate prior to it, but ovulated normally after it. But my luteal phases were very short— too short to sustain a pregnancy. We enlisted an RE to help after my midwife said to go ahead and give them a call.

I had a stillbirth at 27 weeks in June, so I've been there. Try to get some time off work - you delivered a baby, which should give you access to maternity leave, bereavement leave, SOMETHING. Your body needs to recover, too, let alone you need some space to grieve. Most people don't know how to talk about stillbirth, so your coworkers may be trying too hard to not say the wrong thing. I found it hardest when people said nothing and just pretended it never happened. I finally started telling people, ""It's ok to talk about Rose. It's better to talk about her.""

Call your doctor TODAY, even if your post-partum appointment is a ways away. Ask to talk to a nurse - they can help talk you through some of the immediate physical needs. Ask if there's a hospital support group available for people who have lost babies. [SHARE](http://nationalshare.org/) is a national umbrella group that has a monthly virtual chat, and has a searchable database to see if you can find a group near you. It helps so much to hear from others in your shoes. You could also call the hospital where you delivered and ask to speak to the chaplain. I am 0% religious, but our hospital chaplain was amazing - she knew exactly what to say, and gave me access to lots of resources. 

My husband and I talked about our stillbirth a LOT. Not for the first month - we could barely function. But after we got through the first month, we started talking about our feelings and our expectations and what trying again would mean. I still haven't been medically cleared to try again - I had a 3rd D&C just before Christmas because there was still some retained placenta hanging around - but all my doctors said to take some time, anyway, and get over the trauma. I was angry at them for saying that at the time, but I'm glad we did, as I'm in a much better place mentally. The grief never goes away, but you learn how to co-exist with it.  

You may not be ready for it yet, but Elizabeth McCracken's ""An Exact Replica of a Figment of My Imagination"" is an amazing memoir of a woman who suffered a full-term stillbirth, then got pregnant again soon after. I read it about 4 months later, and found myself vigorously agreeing with much of what she said - it was so comforting to see my feelings validated by someone else who has been through it and made it to the other side.

We're here for you. Hugs to you as you take these next steps forward.

A loss is a loss. Whether you had a ""chemical pregnancy"" or lost an infant after birth, if you feel you lost something, then those are valid feelings. 

We all find ourselves being cynical after loss, which are also valid feelings. We often think things like ""well, I hope their baby doesn't die,"" and ""they don't deserve to have a baby/be pregnant,"" and while those seem like terrible thoughts, they're normal. Just because something is unpleasant, as we all unfortunately know, doesn't mean it's not normal. 

Don't worry about being ""irrational and shallow."" This is a safe space. All feelings are valid.

I'd be really interested in a paper or two regarding the tissue damage thing, because I've never heard that. Typically, the ""controversy"" comes down to mothers using the Doppler later in pregnancy when they feel reduced movement to reassure themselves, which we all know you're not supposed to do. Before that, it's because it's hard AF to find the heartbeat for a doctor (my doctor and his med student SUCK at it), let alone a mother whose fear is increasing every second she doesn't find it. 

Let's talk a bit about your movement since a lot of us have been there. Do you know where your placenta is? If it's anterior, you may feel reduced movement. Just a reminder that your baby is currently around 6.5 inches (16.4 cm) long from crown to rump and weighs 10.6 oz (300 g), so about the size of a stapler. Those are some teeny feet and hands! Baby could easily be facing your back or have their feet into your placenta. Once a day is GREAT for this gestational age.

<p>I&#39;d be really interested in a paper or two regarding the tissue damage thing, because I&#39;ve never heard that. Typically, the &quot;controversy&quot; comes down to mothers using the Doppler later in pregnancy when they feel reduced movement to reassure themselves, which we all know you&#39;re not supposed to do. Before that, it&#39;s because it&#39;s hard AF to find the heartbeat for a doctor (my doctor and his med student SUCK at it), let alone a mother whose fear is increasing every second she doesn&#39;t find it. </p>

<p>Let&#39;s talk a bit about your movement since a lot of us have been there. Do you know where your placenta is? If it&#39;s anterior, you may feel reduced movement. Just a reminder that your baby is currently around 6.5 inches (16.4 cm) long from crown to rump and weighs 10.6 oz (300 g), so about the size of a stapler. Those are some teeny feet and hands! Baby could easily be facing your back or have their feet into your placenta. Once a day is GREAT for this gestational age. But if I were you, and the Doppler was helping, I&#39;d keep using it, because the reward would outweigh any risks for me.</p>

I feel like at least early pregnancy I’ve got a handle on (I mean, after 5 times...sad ironic eye roll), but obviously I don’t know what mid/late pregnancy will feel like and what my needs will be. And I’m not a very independent person nor do I have a very high threshold for pain/discomfort.

If this past pregnancy had carried to term, he would’ve been gone for the birth + 3 months after. We discussed that extensively and decided it was worth it. So I’m curious if I’d be okay with a loss all alone too. Or if he’d be okay hearing of a loss while alone overseas.

With a later loss, most women seem to develop stronger feelings of attachment, but in our case, our twins were essentially doomed from a few weeks after conception—they failed to separate very early on, possibly even before I took a pregnancy test. Understanding that reality has meant feeling more distant as time has passed. 

In the moments before we were told why they passed, while staring at an incomprehensible image on the ultrasound screen, we were incredibly attached and devastated. That was our BABY, our very first baby! The first grandchild for both sets of our parents. There was so much hope wrapped up in the pregnancy, so much excitement, and in that confusing moment before we knew they were twins, we felt a sense of loss beyond a medical complication.

We receive a lot of platitudes when we explain the circumstances of our loss to others—there’s a lot of ‘it was for the best’ and ‘at least they didn’t suffer.’ But WE suffered. Platitudes never help us. They don’t bring back our hopes and excitement; they dismiss our lived experience by forcing a positive light on a horrific time, and deny the significance of our twins. We enjoy finding silver linings, but they are ours to find.

My employer validating my loss in this way was a comfort as well as an unwelcome reminder of Blueberry’s significance.

It seems to go back and forth. I find on days when I’m feeling stronger emotionally, that I’m able to think of our little Blueberry as an actual baby (babies) than some doomed entity. When I’m having a harder day, I find myself dismissing the whole ordeal as a medical misfortune. It’s likely a coping mechanism.

I have an ultrasound in 3 hours at my OB office. First medical ultrasound in 3 weeks and I’m so nervous. Movement has been off and on and my anxiety has been dialed up. 

My therapist asked me yesterday if I’m sad. I was like “Not really. As anxious as I am, I don’t think I’ve really processed that this could be another loss.”  

She goes, “No. Not sad about losing the baby. Sad that your experience of pregnancy is so hard. That you have to be constantly on edge and vigilant.” 

This was after I told her I probably spend 80% of my day obsessing about movement and thinking about the pregnancy. 

It is exhausting and I don’t think I let myself realize that till yesterday. So I had a nice sob fest when I got home. 

Hoping life continues after the ultrasound and this doesn’t mark the beginning of another end. 

**UPDATE**  Still a girl, amniotic fluid level looks good and the blood flow through the cord looks good. I have a growth scan on the 22nd with my MFM so they didn't want to do measurements today (which I'm actually okay with because they would just cause me anxiety!) She's curled up into a little ball on one side of my uterus - which is probably why movement continues to feel muffled - but she was definitely moving around.

Trying to just trust in my baby and body that all will be well.  Thank you for the support. It really helps me feel less alone. <3
