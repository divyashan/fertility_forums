All for a mistake that could have been corrected had I understood what I&#39;d done incorrectly during april. So frustrated with myself. Then I had a panic/anxiety attach because of (above) and CD1 hormones. Thanks body.</p>

<p>Yesterday while on a break from work (but still in uniform), I was approached by several different people all wanting to know what I was going to do about an orphaned gosling in the park pond. (Apparently my uniform is indistinguishable from some sort of park worker lol).
The answer, nothing, Ducks and Geese have great big litters of ducklings and goslings because they are TERRIBLE parents and there&#39;s a huge attrition rate. &quot;Oh look Martha. This year 2 of our 6 babies survived! We&#39;re getting better at this, the death rate is only 2/3rd now!&quot; </p>

<p>So I was angry at ducks yesterday because of their terrible parenting. If that isn&#39;t bitterness I don&#39;t know what is, ha ha ha.</p>

<p>Today is a day off so I&#39;m doing enjoyable things and ignoring all the bureaucratic ridiculousness.</p>

It's been a while and I've been dipping in and out of this sub as I'm finding it difficult WTT. For those of you who haven't seen my posts, I lost my little baby boy Leo at 24 weeks on New Year's Day. My water broke and I just went into labour and he died during active labour. My placenta was small and he was small, but perfectly formed. 

Before I went into labour, I called the hospital and told them my ""morning sickness"" symptoms had really ramped up lately. I was losing more weight and vomiting and having diarrhea. They said it was probably the flu and not to come to hospital, but then I ended up going into labour so I went in anyways.

After giving birth, I had about two weeks without symptoms and I could eat and drink normally. Then it all came back - vomiting, nausea, painful poops. I saw my doctor and got referred to a Gastroenterologist. The referral ended up getting cancelled twice due to extreme weather and then a funeral, and each time I got bumped to the end of a long list. In the meantime, my health deteriorated and I kept losing weight and vomiting.

Finally, I saw a gastroenterologist for a private consultation to speed things up and he immediately referred me for a sigmoidoscopy. That was last Monday, and by that point I was so sick that I couldn't hold down water. It took every bit of my energy to get to that appointment.

They had a look at my intestine and discovered that I have a genetic mutation called Familial Adenomatous Polyposis (or FAP, lol) which causes precancerous polyps to grow in the digestive tract. There is also a partial blockage in there, so all of my food has to get through a 1cm hole. It basically needs that they need to remove my large intestine.

They did a CT scan and the polyps look benign despite being quite gnarly (it looks worse than google image search results) so even if they are cancerous, they are self contained in my intestine and haven't put out any roots or whatever cancer does. The biopsy results come back today so fingers crossed.

I'm not sure how pregnancy played a role here but I know that my symptoms became much worse during pregnancy, so I feel like maybe if I didn't get pregnant, I wouldn't have pursued answers. Heck, maybe I wouldn't have found out! Maybe my little lion has saved me... I think about Leo every day and wish that I had been healthy enough to give him a fighting chance at life, but I can't change what happened and I have to soldier on.

I'm waiting for surgery and the recovery will delay is trying again, but even after I will have a risk of 50% of passing this stupid gene mutation on, so we may have to make test tube babies. It's like one step forward, three steps back. But I tell you what. If I ever get to be a mommy, I will be the happiest woman in the world a know that this struggle will be worth it.

Progesterone and estrogen after confirmed ovulation (You should learn to chart your cycles so you can confirm ovulation yourself). You need peak day plus 7 and peak plus 9.

CD3 FSH and LH -- to rule out egg quality problems.

Anti-mullerian hormones -- egg quality problems

Prolactin -- measured throughout your cycle -- can cause implantation issues

Thyroid testing -- TSH, Free T4, Free T3, Reverse T3, anti-TPO Ab, anti-TG Ab, anti-TSI Ab

Full auto-immune panel -- Anti-phospholipid antibodies, Lupus screen, rheumatoid arthritis antibody, C-Reactive Protein, Anti-nuclear antibodies (again for lupus)

Blood clotting panel -- Factor V leiden testing, Anti-cardiolipin antibodies, antithrombin antibodies

Nutritional panel - Vitamin D, Vitamin B12, Carnitine, GGT 

Metabolic issues -- MTHFR gene panel, Homocysteine

Blood panel - RBC, Hemoglobin, Iron/Ferritin/Total Iron Binding Capacity, white blood cell count, platelet count, MCH, MCV, MCHC

Testosterone -- throughout your cycle

Oral glucose tolerance test with insulin measurements -- to rule out hidden insulin resistance (this is possible even if you are thin and don't eat sugar -- some people have shit luck)

Hemoglobin A1C -- again to rule out insulin issues

Adrenal panel -- DHEA Sulfate, androstenedione, cortisol (ideally over 24 hours via saliva), 17-hydroxyprogesterone

A comprehensive metabolic panel and lipid panel will probably not hurt either.

Also, you should absolutely learn to chart your cycle. Timing tests on day 21 (for 7 days past ovulation) is not a good idea, since the actual day since ovulation is likely to be different. Ideally, these tests are actually correlated with confirmed ovulation. You can learn from a book (like taking charge of your fertility) or through an organization. My wife and I learned from the Couple-to-Couple league.

Another bit of advice, make sure your doctor uses the proper ranges for thyroid tests during pregnancy. The American Thyroid Association says TSH ought to be below 2 optimally, and below 2.5 at minimum.

I feel as if I am in limbo right now - so I am not sure where to post this. :(

My period was due Friday. I started getting a head-cold and was super exhausted so I took the day off from work to rest. Period did not show up. Had a little bit of brown spotting (last time I was preg I had this too, which I accounted as implantation bleeding) and tiny mild cramping.

Saturday morning took a Wondfo test (12ish DPO?) and got a squinter line. It was barely there, but there. I've taken a few tests over the last few days. Still barely there (lighter even) on the Wondfo (maybe my pee is diluted - I drink so much water during the day) but lines have still popped up on cheapies from Walmart, generic Target ERs and actual FRERs. Nothing getting any darker though or blaring positive (my post history has some pics from tfablineporn).

The dr called me this morning to go over my blood results from my annual (all good) and I mention that I had a barely there line. She said a line is a line so let's make an appt (for this Thursday) for some blood work. I took another test, still a squinter. Two hours later when I peed there was some bright red blood spots (enough to show quite a bit on the panty liner) so I am guessing the end is near, this isn't going to end up as anything and maybe it's a chemical pregnancy?

<p>I also hate hearing stories of women whose babies were &quot;saved,&quot; like the boy born prematurely due to preeclampsia. I&#39;m surprised she didn&#39;t get it, she was scared for her son&#39;s life at one point in her pregnancy, she should have an inkling of an idea as to how this pain feels for us. But unfortunately I guess mothers don&#39;t understand unless they try to be empathetic, like the other coworker who distracted you, or unless they went through loss before, not just a scary experience where their babies ultimately made it. I hope you have a better day today üíï</p>

Guys, I got a job! Fucking FINALLY. Those that remember, I've been in the process of applying and interviewing for a select few positions over the last like six months and it's been so emotionally draining. I'm a nurse and I've been really picky about where I've wanted to work again because my last place of employment (level 1 trauma center ER) was such a toxic work environment. I loved ER nursing and did it for five years, but I hated the company - it was a constant revolving door of employees because they had horrible retention. So this time around it's been a lot of back and forth and really fine tuning what I want. But, I'm excited about where I'll be working because this company has amazing retention - something largely unheard of in nursing, and it'll be so nice to work for a company people really enjoy being a part of. I start May 15 so (assuming everything is still ok and progressing pregnancy-wise) I'll only hopefully have to deal with a few weeks of first tri fatigue, nausea, etc before I'll be into the second tri.

Hi ladies. So sorry I've been absent for so long! I still read your comments every day!

I had a 28 week growth scan and it seems my boy is big. REALLY BIG! He should be around 2.5 pounds when actually he was estimated to be 3lb 11oz. Well outside the normal range. Glucose tolerance test was normal so he is just big. I'm wondering if it has anything to do with my dad. He was a 10 pounder. At the moment, my baby is projected to be 9lb. The doctor was really lovely and said not to panic and let other people's comments worry me. I should still be able to give birth vaginally. They will measure my pelvis and he might need to come early.

Talking of labour.... I had a majorly scary moment a few days ago. I woke up with a sore  back. Like a strong ache and it was getting really bad. I called up my husband to rub my back and the pain just got out of control. I was moaning and calling out. Every 30 seconds or if I tried to move it was agony in my back and lower bump. Hubby took me to hospital and they took me to the ward in a wheelchair. I crawled onto the bed and it stopped! Completely! It was like the change of position just sorted it. The doctor was not very interested and just said it was SPD but no advice. I've slept with a pillow between my legs since then and it hasn't happened since. It has really shaken me though. I haven't really been worrying about the birth but now I am absolutely terrified. I don't know how I would cope with that sort of pain again.

Anyway, hope you ladies are all well!",[],,t1_dh0y6wo,False,0,[],False,"<div class=""md""><p>29+2</p>

<p>So far, we&#39;re thinking about going out to brunch the Saturday before Mother&#39;s Day (cheaper) and then we&#39;re going to a 20th anniversary showing of the Fifth Element on Mother&#39;s Day. =D</p>

<p>I haven&#39;t decided what to post on Facebook though. My mother gets sad if I don&#39;t post something honoring her, but last year I did a cryptic post about how Mother&#39;s Day is hard for some people, and so I&#39;m trying to figure out if I can combine celebrating mothers in my life with expressing my complicated feelings about it, or if I should make separate posts.</p>

The application process seems ridiculous (forms that need to be filled out by me, my boss, and my doctor, then approved by head office), and barely worth it if I&#39;m only taking something like 5 days off.</p>

<p>At the moment I feel like I could probably go to work, but I wouldn&#39;t be very focused. I feel mildly nauseated, very tired, and have a bit of GI disturbance, but my job isn&#39;t physical, just mentally demanding. I just don&#39;t know what&#39;s going to happen when the methotrexate kicks in, and if it doesn&#39;t work then I&#39;m facing repeat injections and possibly surgery.</p>

<p>I wish I could just tell work &quot;I will need X days off, at which point I will be recovered&quot;, but in reality I might be feeling much worse in two weeks than I am now.</p>

We'll go back after my vacation to check the heart rate. Today we just saw it beating but it had just started, and she didn't want to measure the rate yet.

I can't stop being terrified though, and I'm constantly texting for updates now. I wonder if I'm projecting anxiety into her, and I really really don't want her to feel that.

On Monday, DH tells me we have to pick up an old friend of his from the airport on Thursday and that he will be staying with us through the weekend. Ummm okay, he has family in town, why not stay with them? Well because there is some crazy family shit going on and he wants nothing of it. Okay, I know his family and they can be crazy, so it's fine. We clean the house all nice (you know like visitors nice instead of everyday nice) and get the guest room prepared. Thursday evening we go drive the hour to the airport and pick him up. On the ride home he says he is going to stay at his mom's house because she guilt tripped him, but that we'll definitely hang out tomorrow and he'll stay with us the rest of the time. Ummmm okay. Then Thursday night/Friday morning I have my miscarriage. When he texts in the morning asking if I wanted to go out with him that night, I told him no, that I just had a second miscarriage and wasn't feeling well. He knew about the first one and was supportive so I had no problem telling him about this one as well. He says he's so sorry and take all the time you need. Great. But then later he asked DH if he would go out with him and DH was like no, I'm going to spend some quiet time tonight with stlyst89. And friend was like oh okay and didn't end up going out at all. So at this point I'm getting annoyed because I feel like he wants/needs is to be his uber while he parties. Anywho, so he stays with his mom again. I guess the family drama isn't that bad after all. 

So DH (and I) decide we should definitely make an effort to hang out Saturday and go to dinner with a group of mutual acquaintances/friends of the old friend who is visiting. One of which is the old friend's sister. Now I am totally ambivalent towards her, I just don't know her enough to either like or not like her. But when I was going through my last miscarriage the old friend was very supportive and around us a lot and so she ended up finding out about the loss. Her words of comfort were ""I'm so sorry. At least you can get pregnant! I've been told I'll never be able to have kids/get pregnant."" Um okay, thanks I guess. Like I know infertility reeeaaaally sucks, but it's not a fucking competition. Like I would never go up to a woman struggling with infertility and say ""well at least you never have to suffer pregnancy loss because you can't get pregnant"" with two thumbs up. Because that would be awful and rude and not fucking comforting at all on top of being not necessarily true. Anyway, his sister is there and she is not drinking. Someone asks why and she says she is DDing. That's fine. Except the old friend, her brother (who has apparently decided to become an asshole since moving away) says actually there is announcement to be made, and the sister literally says, ""[brother/old friend's name] no, don't say anything!"" Okay well I'm obviously not dumb, no drinking + announcement, duh. And then he announces she is pregnant, even after she asked him not to. So the apparently infertile woman, who was not even ttc, got pregnant 1-2 months after my first loss and telling me she can't ever get pregnant. I plaster a fake ass smile on my face and say congrats. I really am happy for her, she obviously had nothing to do with my two losses, but it seems all so unfair. She mouths sorry to me across the table, I tell her not to worry about it, and then she glares at brother/old friend. He likes what?! Later the friend and DH go outside to smoke and he tells DH that his sister is mad at him because she didn't want to announce in front of me because she didn't want me to be upset. Now, I think that was really considerate of her and she only knew about my first loss. So I'm fucking seething at this friend because he knew about my first loss and how hard it was and how badly I wanted to get pregnant again. And he knew I did get pregnant again and just lost that one literally the fucking day before. And he knew she didn't want to announce it to everyone in front of me, but he still fucking did it anyways. So I'm pissed off at him for her because no one should ever announce someone else's pregnancy to people without their express permission and I'm pissed because he knew everything that I was going through related to pregnancy and still decided to tell me. Me and his sister aren't friends in real life or any type of social media. I would have never needed to find out she was pregnant. Why publicly tell me when I am still going through a second loss?

And then my DH asks him if he needs a ride to the airport today. Umm no. Even if he did fuck that. This dude asked to stay at our house, we were nice and said yes and did extra cleaning so it would be nice and then he never stays here, only seems like he wants rides to go out drinking, and then publicly traumatizes me. He can fucking walk to the airport for all I care.

Warning: language and self pity 

So, I think I might have SPD ( symphysis pubis dysfunction). The pain in my pelvis region when I walk, and especially when walking up stairs or getting into the car is severe. I almost cried several times this week because of the pain. I thought it was ""just"" some kind of RLP that would go away within a week once whatever is growing there is done. 

But today I did some research and SPD totally fits. http://www.nhs.uk/conditions/pregnancy-and-baby/pages/pelvic-pain-pregnant-spd.aspx 

And here I thought my body couldn't fuck up any more. What with getting rheumatoid arthritis when I was 24 and then not going into remission during pregnancy. 

Monday is a national holiday here, so the earliest I can see a doctor is Tuesday. Argh.

<p>I agree with the other comment, it&#39;s been helpful for me to throw myself into generic weight loss communities. I joined the current <a href=""/r/loseit"">r/loseit</a> challenge and I&#39;ve made some progress, although I&#39;m currently struggling and plateaued a bit. Other people there struggle too...not for the same reasons, but it still feels like common ground sometimes.</p>

<p>We all gained weight for different reasons there. The unifying thread is that we want to lose it, and discussions usually center around that. You may run into a few women who&#39;ve recently had a baby, but not in anywhere near the concentration you do when looking at postpartum weight loss resources.</p>

<p>Another option is to google &quot;weight loss after stillbirth&quot; specifically. I did this for miscarriage and found some posts and articles, although they were mostly about the emotional side of it and less about practical tips.</p>

But baby Will is doing great, he grew an inch and a half already and is back at birth weight. Eating like a champ. We are so in love with him. His hair is coming in red!!

Healing from the c-section is going great, breastfeeding is exhausting and we are dependent on a nipple shield but I like having him eat and holding him close. He makes the best noises when breastfeeding. My house is a mess but oh well.

Anatomy scan today. I work an early shift so I always have the end of day appointments so sometimes I feel silly posting here because an update won't be until after 4pm est. 

I feel ungrateful for posting this in this thread but here it goes. I'm worried about gender disappointment. Hubs and I are both convinced it's a boy and both want a boy. Frankly everyone around us keeps guessing boy, which will mean if it's a girl we're just going to have to wrap our heads around it. I'm happy with healthy baby, but I've wanted a boy since before we started trying because frankly I feel like I have shitty genes for a girl. I don't want to have a girl that has shitty PCOS that causes weight gain and excess hair growth (that gets you made fun of starting in middle school) and painful periods when you do get them and then shitty doctors telling you you'll never be able to get pregnant. 

Thanks for reading that rant. Will update later today when we hopefully find out sex of the Sprout. I think that the gender thing has me so worked up that I'm not even worried about anything else possibly being wrong at this point.

I wish there was some rule that if you suffer a significant loss, you are protected from all future heartbreak. It sure seems like that would be fair, doesn't it? Or that since you tried for so long, you should have been guaranteed a healthy baby. 

My story involves subsequent 1st and 2nd trimester losses - I'm the horror story many women fear happening to them. 

After learning all the terrible things that can happen in pregnancy and to newborns - the fear of random 'bad luck' doesn't stop there for me. What if I have a child with significant special needs and delays? What if my child gets into a car accident and their brain function is affected? What if my living children get a serious illness?  
What if, what if, what if?

But the thing is - terrible things can and will happen. I can't make my decisions from a place of fear. My anxiety can be helpful sometimes in preparing me for the worst, but I can't let it dictate everything. I can't never let my children ride in cars, but I *can* make sure they are in safe carseats. Reasonable risks are reasonable.

Humans are capable of enduring far more suffering and heartache than I ever thought possible. I find hope and solace in the stories of other people who've faced the worst imaginable and kept going.

Julian is two weeks old now and I'm finally starting to have more days where I feel like we're figuring this parenting thing out. We've had an uphill climb in the feeding department--a host of factors  (NICU stay, small sleepy baby, delayed milk coming in) made it quite difficult to establish breastfeeding. We've been in a fog of waking him up to feed, pumping, and bottles. Thankfully things are on the upswing and other than using a nipple shield because he won't latch any other way, I think we're figuring things out. Other than that, he's doing great and is just the cutest!!

They tell you to expect the ""baby blues"" (they really drilled it into us in the hospital, which I appreciated) but I still wasn't prepared for the insane onslaught of hormones and emotions. I cried SO much, often without knowing why. I'm glad my husband had been told to expect that, because even though he was concerned, he also knew it was normal. I'm starting to feel a little more normal, especially when I get adequate amounts of food and sleep. Still, be warned that you will have days when you're frantic and anxious and tearful and hysterical and a total wreck.

Having this baby hasn't made the pain of losing Isaac any less or made us forget him. The other day DH got a bit emotional because even though we will have a baby with us for Mother's Day and Father's Day and Christmas this year, it isn't our first baby. And my mom said the other day, she was a bit sad that her father is no longer with us and couldn't see Julian, but my dad told her, ""I always just picture him in heaven holding Isaac."" All the tears. That being said, there has been a lot of healing in our hearts. Sometimes it feels like we're just going to burst with how happy we are that he's here. He has been worth all the trials we went through to bring him into this world. Hang in there, ladies. There is a light at the end of the tunnel.

I'm sorry for the radio silence since Monday but guys. I had my baby! I'm still in disbelief. After being admitted around 1 AM on Tuesday, Alessandro (nickname Ale, pronounced Ah-lay) was born at 1:19 pm. I was in labor for maybe 14 hours total, but really, I have no idea when my labor actually started since I was having contractions for over 48 hours before going to the hospital. The really bad ones started about 14 hours before he was born, so let's say 14 hours. When I got to the hospital, I was 6 cm. Somewhere around 7-8 cm, they broke my water. Unfortunately at that point, they saw he had pooped in there, and they explained what that meant for the delivery. There would be pediatrician present in case they needed to suction his airways in the case that he breathed in the meconium. I was worried, but the doctor was awesome and made me feel ¬†at ease.¬†


Around 10 AM, they said I was 9 cm and that we'd probably start the pushing in an hour. I'd had an epidural, which I cannot recommend highly enough, and I had trouble sleeping because I was shaking a lot and also just so excited. For some reason, when they told me the pushing was coming, the shaking stopped and I finally fell asleep. Around noon, they woke me up and checked me, and said I was 10 cm. I was barely awake, covered in drool, and in shock. Was this really happening? I couldn't believe my body was actually doing what it was supposed to be doing. After the miscarriage and nine months of fear and worry, it was so hard to trust my body. I was still waiting for the other shoe to drop.¬†


They asked if I wanted a mirror to watch the delivery, and I said yes. It really helped me to push because I could see the progress happening. My husband don't watch at first, but after the head started emerging, he did. After a couple pushes, the doctor said she could see his head and that he had dark hair. At the moment, I lost it. I started crying, and that caused my husband to start crying, too. This was happening! He was coming, and we would meet him soon. It was an emotional high like none I've felt before.


My contractions started to slow down, so they started some pitocin to keep them going. After an hour of pushing, he came out! They plopped him on my chest, but after a couple seconds, they saw he was having a little trouble breathing. Ok, I thought here it is. The other shoe was finally dropping. There were a few moments where I was sure he was dying, and I was sobbing while they were stitching me up. They sucked some gunk from his lungs, and he was fine. They brought him over to me for skin-to-skin. He was perfect and adorable.


After some minutes of fumbling around, trying to remember everything I ever learned about breastfeeding all while reeling from everything that had happened, I got him to latch. I didn't realize that the hormones released from breastfeeding can cause you to feel really hot and flushed, so I told them I was sweating and they took my temperature, which showed a low fever. This triggered another round of tests for Ale, but he was fine. My temperature came down and I later learned about the hormones.¬†


After they removed the epidural, we got taken to our recovery room, and we've been cozy in here since then! Ale's been latching and feeding really well, though my nipples are starting to feel the wear and tear. He's peeing and pooping and passing his tests. We are both infatuated with our little burrito and just still in awe that we're here. One year ago, I was happily pregnant with my first, not knowing that pregnancy would end just a few short weeks later. I had no idea what was in store for me over the next 12 months. It has been a long road since we decided to have a kid 2.5 years ago, and I never ever thought I'd make it here. As I stood in the shower today, the tears began to flow because I am just so grateful to my body for what it did for me, Ale, and my husband. I feel so much tenderness and love for for it after struggling with it for so long, not just with this pregnancy and the miscarriage, but also the struggle to get pregnant, and the struggle to accept and love my body. I may never like how I look in shorts or be athletic or graceful in any way, but¬†I made a fucking person and squeezed him out of my vagina. That's pretty cool, body.

This sub has been an incredible source of strength for me since my loss. I cannot thank you all enough for your kindness and support. I haven't always been the most active participant, but I don't know how I would have gotten through my loss, TTC after that, and the anxiety of this pregnancy if it weren't for this very special corner of the internet.¬† From the bottom of my heart, thank you.¬†Love and hugs to all of you.",[],,t1_dgtpblc,False,0,[],False,"<div class=""md""><p>Super long post warning!

I got my first beta numbers back yesterday(drawn Tuesday).

HCG was 4137, which is almost exactly doubling every 48 hours, based on last week's (6 days prior) number of 504. I have my 2nd draw this morning at 9:30, hopefully the trend will continue...

So I asked my new doctor to test progesterone, ""just out of curiosity"" and she did, with the caveat that if it was low, we really couldn't do anything about it.

So it came back low. :/ 

11.7 at 5 + 1. Even though she said there was nothing to do, I emailed her asking about suppositories. She said she normally only starts that at ovulation,  it after you're pregnant, but if it would make me feel better she'd prescribe it. I love this doctor so much. 

So now I'm on supplements, and hoping for the best. Trying not to worry too much, however I'm convinced if I do miscarry again, it'll be in the middle of my San Francisco vacay next week.

Ramble: I know one person IRL who has had 3 losses, but is now pregnant and last night I dreamt that I went to TX for her baby shower. Which is weird, because we are old coworkers and strictly internet friends, but the dream was so nice, she was so happy and I shared with her that I was pregnant. And then we went out to get donuts, and my husband got a lobster donut and I was so repulsed that I couldn't even order a donut, so I went outside and sitting right there was my old dog who died 2 years ago. It was her, without a doubt and so wonderful to see her. It turned out that she didn't die, she just somehow was sent to Texas, but we found her. And I was not even mad, I was just so happy to have her back. Now I'm sitting here at work, thinking about the dream and nearly sobbing. And then laughing because how the f will I explain this if someone walks into my office? Pregnancy hormones are real. 

Non-ramble: I also set a date to tell my in-laws. (I've been dragging my feet because they can be a little smothery and annoying.) We leave on vacation May 12, so I set up a dinner with them for May 7 as a pre-Mother's Day dinner. I bought this label, which I will put on a bottle of wine, wrap that up, and boom there's your Mother's Day present. A grandchild. It's not an over the top announcement, but hopefully will take them a second to understand and hell it's a keepsake if they want one.

I bought this label, which I will put on a bottle of wine, wrap that up, and boom there&#39;s your Mother&#39;s Day present. A grandchild. It&#39;s not an over the top announcement, but hopefully will take them a second to understand and hell it&#39;s a keepsake if they want one. </p>

A sweet story in the meantime- last week i got some good kicks and it seemed like we were transitioning out of the flutter stage, then from Saturday on it was back to tiny movements and they didn't seem as frequent.

But THEN last night when my husband was back home and we were eating dinner together the baby went absolutely nuts.  I think he/she just likes the sound of his voice!!! So now instead of cold water and jelly beans I'm just going to have him talk in his booming voice when I get nervous.  

Update:  all looks good with baby, so happy!!!! Measured perfectly and moving around in there all cute and cozy.  Cervix was long and closed, and no evidence of scar tissue or anything remaining from my procedures.

Not sure why or if anything triggered it today but by god I was in pain. I think the baby might have moved lower (but dont think it 'dropped' because the internets says it's an extreme feeling).

Update: So they didn't see anything other than my uterus thickening. They only did an abdominal ultrasound though, instead of vaginal, which I thought was weird for an early scan. They said they always check with the abdominal first and then if they see anything at all, they switch to the vaginal because the vaginal can cause spotting and they don't want to cause any additional anxiety if it's unnecessary.

They also ordered me labs to get my beta tested today and Friday to see if it's doubling. So I guess we'll know more Friday.

Also she is SO understanding of how paranoid I am!

She orders two quant blood tests, and I asked if she could test progesterone, just so I'd feel better. She said at this point there isn't really anything to do if it comes back low, but she'd test it just to make me feel better. 

Also she just suggested a ultrasound yesterday! She said we probably wouldn't see much, but she could check everything out, and make sure there wasn't anything obviously wrong. 

We found a gestational sac, and, eventually, she found the yolk sac, which she said was really encouraging. I was asking her about chemical pregnancy and blighted ovum and stuff so I think that's why she pushed so hard (literally) so she could see the yolk sac. 

AND, I assumed she would want me back at eight weeks, but she said I could come back next week for another ultrasound! I was so excited until I realized I'm on vacation next week, but oh well.

I still have no real symptoms, but I'm starting to get cautiously optimistic about this one...

As a preface, my husband and I were both on the fence about having kids for a long time. We've been together for 11 years, both love to travel and shop and have expensive hobbies. Neither one of us went into marriage with kids being a requirement, so when we decided to TTC at ages 31/35, I was perhaps a bit more scared (at how our lives and our relationship may change) than I was excited, but also looking forward to expanding our family. So...I expect my answer will be different from someone who has lived their entire life wanting nothing more than to have kids. 

We are lucky in that I seem to get pregnant fairly easily, and I imagine that also changes things. After my first MC at 15w, the first thing I said was ""I never, ever want to go through this again."" Very quickly, I wanted to be pregnant again ASAP. That happened 3 months later, but I went into that pregnancy very pessimistic and expecting the worst. Yet after that loss, I think I was more determined than ever to have my baby and be a mom. My losses have really shown me how badly I want to see my husband as a dad, too.

So what keeps me/us going? Wanting to be a mom more than I want to give up. Picturing my parents becoming grandparents. Being surrounded by an amazing support group. You guys, friends, the medical team behind me (OB, fertility clinic) monitoring and doing everything in their power to help me. Knowing that every single person on this earth struggles with *something* and this is mine/ours and we will survive it. Chocolate and beer. 

All that being said, we have discussed our ""limit"" at length and can't see us trying past 3 losses. I hope to God it doesn't come to this, but I don't want our entire lives to revolve around pregnancy and loss. We aren't super young, and we both believe we can have a very good and fulfilling life together without kids. It wouldn't be what we want right now, but we could adjust.

I&#39;ve still got a couple of pounds to lose before I&#39;m back to pre-pregnancy weight (and then I&#39;ve got some additional weight to lose that I should&#39;ve lost before getting pregnant in the first place), but I, too, am looking forward to having a fresh healthier start. :-)</p>

I'm sorry to hear about the loss of your sweet baby Matilda. Loss like this shouldn't happen and its terrible when it does - it turns your whole life upside down. It makes no sense and you'll never ""understand"". 

And you're right - knowing WHY won't change her death. But I do hope you get some type of answer. Unexplained loss is terribly hard and answers can give a bit of closure in an otherwise extra confusing situation. And can help anxiety in a future pregnancy. I am sorry that you've been warned you may not get an answer -- and that its true. Either way, you will move forward. I promise. 

And I say move forward, not move on -- because nobody just moves on from the loss of their child. But we do learn to move forward in life. Minute by minute, then hour by hour, then day by day...we have to, so we do. 

Please don't put a timeline on your grief. Grief isn't linear and it doesn't fit itself to any schedule. Feel what you feel and take care of yourself. Don't let yourself or others tell you when its time to stop grieving -- you will never fully stop, and that's ok. You will just slowly have better days, where the loss of Matilda doesn't overshadow every other thing in life. But for now, that's ok and you're doing alright. I promise. HUGS.

No baby you have in the future will replace Matilda. She will always be your daughter and she will be those kid's big sister. <3

I'm thinking of you and hoping for the best for you. You're so welcome and understood here. I hope you receive the comfort and understanding you need.

",[],,t1_dgnzxw5,False,0,[],False,"<div class=""md""><p>Welcome to the sub...I am so sorry you needed us but glad you found us. I&#39;m sorry to hear about the loss of your sweet baby Matilda. Loss like this shouldn&#39;t happen and its terrible when it does - it turns your whole life upside down. It makes no sense and you&#39;ll never &quot;understand&quot;. </p>

<p>And you&#39;re right - knowing WHY won&#39;t change her death. But I do hope you get some type of answer. Unexplained loss is terribly hard and answers can give a bit of closure in an otherwise extra confusing situation. And can help anxiety in a future pregnancy. I am sorry that you&#39;ve been warned you may not get an answer -- and that its true. Either way, you will move forward. I promise. </p>

<p>And I say move forward, not move on -- because nobody just moves on from the loss of their child. But we do learn to move forward in life. Minute by minute, then hour by hour, then day by day...we have to, so we do. </p>

<p>Please don&#39;t put a timeline on your grief. Grief isn&#39;t linear and it doesn&#39;t fit itself to any schedule. Feel what you feel and take care of yourself. Don&#39;t let yourself or others tell you when its time to stop grieving -- you will never fully stop, and that&#39;s ok. You will just slowly have better days, where the loss of Matilda doesn&#39;t overshadow every other thing in life. But for now, that&#39;s ok and you&#39;re doing alright. I promise. HUGS.</p>

<p>No baby you have in the future will replace Matilda. She will always be your daughter and she will be those kid&#39;s big sister. &lt;3</p>

I also have cute ideas for telling people when I'm farther along.. like a ""big brother shirt"" for my son, or an ultrasound or something. At this moment I have nothing really.

On another hand, (lots of hands), if I tell her she will let me take naps at her house when I visit. (She lives an hour away and I am always just exhausted by the time I get there.)

I'm getting anxious because 5+3 is where I officially lost my last one, with spotting days before. I'm trying hard not to freak out over the weekend. 

On the plus side, my line progression is looking strong, and I'm nearly out of Wondfos, so I guess I'll stop that now, lol. 

[line porn](http://imgur.com/ixTvedH)

So yesterday I *finally* got a hold of my nurse to get the results from my quant test on Tuesday. (They take a two hour lunch break- who does that??) Anyway, she said it was at 504, which I guess is ok for 16 DPO? Then she said ""so that puts you at 4-5 weeks, so we'll schedule you to come back in 4 weeks or so."" 

Like, wtf? Clearly they only did the quant because the didn't believe I knew when my ovulation was. They had no intention of seeing the doubling or checking on anything. 

SO... I found a new doctor yesterday. üòú She's a bit farther of a drive, and not the hospital I'd prefer, but she's a SOLO practice, which I love. She's the only doctor, I don't even know if she has a nurse assistant. She has two front desk people and that's IT. I've heard great things about her being totally understanding of the hypochondria that comes with pregnancy, especially after a loss. A friend said she lets you come in whenever just to check the heartbeat if you want. They do their blood tests in house, so you get them back quickly. She doesn't leave for Christmas, which is great since I'm due Christmas Eve.  I called and explained my situation and they got me in on Monday to do blood work and maybe an ultrasound!  Didn't make me feel stupid about it at all. I'm so excited! 

I was leaning towards a midwifery this go around, but all the local practices have 15+ midwives and you never know who you're going to see, or who will deliver you. I think this solo practice will serve me much better. 

Now I just have to get through the weekend.

A friend said she lets you come in whenever just to check the heartbeat if you want. They do their blood tests in house, so you get them back quickly. She doesn&#39;t leave for Christmas, which is great since I&#39;m due Christmas Eve.  I called and explained my situation and they got me in on Monday to do blood work and maybe an ultrasound!  Didn&#39;t make me feel stupid about it at all. I&#39;m so excited! </p>

<p>I was leaning towards a midwifery this go around, but all the local practices have 15+ midwives and you never know who you&#39;re going to see, or who will deliver you. I think this solo practice will serve me much better. </p>

<p>Now I just have to get through the weekend. </p>

<p>Also- what&#39;s a balloon day?</p>

But I was a silly naive unicorn back then.) Anyways, hoping to keep it up.  </p>

<p>In other news, anatomy scan is in 5 sleeps!! I can&#39;t wait/am terrified.  My fears mostly revolve around placenta/cord because of my scar history, as well as cervix length.  Of course baby too!  But daily kicks are helping a bit with those worries.  But for now, it&#39;s Friday, and I have plans to visit 2 of my favorite ice cream shops in the next few days.  And I just got my first kick of the morning.  So things are, for now, great! </p>

I'm so sorry for your losses; as you say, I think it's been different, and much harder, for you. While I do feel pretty terrible right now, I don't think mine compare to later losses.

As you say, part of me is expecting a third loss, and just wants that done (though I'm not 100% sure that they'll do tests after such early losses - I've seen conflicting information on this).

Yeah, it's not all that common, TBH. I did a ton of reading and never came across it. Our doctor actually put the test in the order just in case, and when it came back elevated, told my wife she could try a drug to bring it down. It did so quite fast, and we got pregnant again that cycle. It also made my wife's cycle go back to the way they were before the miscarriage.

I hear you there! I hate when people tell us to just calm down! I would encourage you to force yourself to do the physical things, if you can. They're linked with lower cortisol, regardless of how actually stressed out you are :).

Did they identify a reason for the loss at 21 weeks? Thyroid problems can definitely cause issues during pregnancy, but usually if a loss is that late, it boils down to shit luck.

My wife and I started trying about a year ago in our early 20s. I had always thought she had hypothyroidism because she was always cold. We went in for a thyroid test before trying but they told us she was fine (her tsh was > 3 at that point). After we lost our first, I insisted we get her thyroid treated and booked her first appointment. TSH had risen to 5 at that point and her doctor was surprised no one had treated her. We had a few more miscarriages after that, but her dose had to be increased as well, so we're not really sure where the thyroid treatment will ultimately lead us.

> it's really frustrating that we are having these issues right now.

Totally understand you there. My wife and I have both been tested after 5 losses in the last year. Turns out that aside from subclinical hypothyroidism in her and hashimoto's in me, we're both pretty healthy. She has no auto-immune disease, no blood clotting abnormalities, a normal menstrual cycle, normal uterus, normal ovaries, normal everything, except we keep losing babies. We started trying for a baby at 23 and doctors are mostly at a loss for explanation at this point.

> Can anyone provide us with some insight?

So your wife has no thyroid right? There are many hormones the thyroid makes and levothyroxine is not the only one, despite what doctors will tell you. My family has a history of hyperthyroidism and both my aunts did the RAI to kill their thyroids. They do not feel okay on synthroid. My wife is hypothyroid, and has had the most success on NDT -- natural dessicated thyroid. This is made from cow or pork thyroid, and contains *all* the hormones your thyroid makes. If you have no thyroid, this is probably a more complete replacement. You'll probably need to find a doctor willing to prescribe it. As my history with my aunts and wife indicate, most doctors are utter crap when it comes to dealing with thyroid problems. Personally, I wouldn't trust any doctor that doesn't specialize in thyroid to treat my thyroid problems. Even endocrinologists can be completely useless in my experience.

> It's been now two cycles, and both times now we have not been able to conceive. For many this is not new, but for us it is, and it is upsetting. We went from always conceiving but losing to not conceiving at all.

There's only like a 20-40% chance that you'll conceive each cycle. It's possible to get lucky a few times, but your past luck doesn't necessary indicate future success. Sounds kinda crappy I know, but it is what it is. Sometimes the trauma of a stillbirth can cause fertility to be delayed. For example, prolactin is the hormone women secrete to cause lactation after birth. It builds up during the entire pregnancy and can take a while to go back down. In the meantime, women are generally infertile. It's less than six months after a loss in November, and it can take up to six months for prolactin to go down to normal levels. Simply having a menstrual cycle doesn't mean other things are all 'back to normal'. For my wife at least, this is kinda what happened. When we first started trying, we got pregnant on the second cycle with a chemical pregnancy, and then the next cycle after we were pregnant again and that ended in miscarriage at 9 weeks. By the time she was recovered it was a few months later, and it took us about 5 months after, due to high prolactin. We ended up treating it, and she immediately got pregnant again, but that resulted in our latest miscarriage. Perhaps this is something to ask your doctor about if you really want to get pregnant ASAP.

I wish I could tell you more really. It sounds shitty, but keep trying is the best advice. Finding a good doctor really helps put you at ease, as does trying to do simple things to reduce stress. Obviously, you can't actually just feel better, but my wife and I have found that trying to do things that are physiologically correlated with lower stress levels has improved our lives, such as getting enough sleep, sleeping in a dark room, meditation and relaxation tapes, etc.

I also really found the book 'coming to term' by jon cohen to be really helpful. It's by a man whose wife lost multiple pregnancies without explanation. He talks about different treatment options, but the statistic I found most promising was that even without treatment and simple tender, loving care, most women who've had a loss will go on to have a healthy pregnancy, and the chance of a healthy next pregnancy is almost always >50%, even in those with an underlying cause to the loss.

Again, I know it's not really comforting. There are days when I get really bummed out, but I find reminding myself of that helps me look past it a bit.

I hope you things get better. ",[],,t1_dgharsl,,0,,False,"<div class=""md""><p>If you don&#39;t mind me asking. Did they identify a reason for the loss at 21 weeks? Thyroid problems can definitely cause issues during pregnancy, but usually if a loss is that late, it boils down to shit luck.</p>

It's about to get gross in here, so don't read on if you're feeling squeamish. Just had my doctor's appointment, and had her do a cervical check since I've been having cramps and pressure. At 36 weeks, my cervix was closed but soft. I thought to myself at the time, these cervical checks are not so bad! Why does everyone complain about them? Well, it turns out to be a whole different story when they can actually get a finger or two in there. Today, I was dilated 2-3 cm and 80% effaced, and HOLY SHIT did that hurt. She got two fingers and there, and it caused a contraction...which was way worse than any of the cramping I've been having so far. Takeaway: if that was only a small contraction, I'm definitely getting an epidural! All the while, she was just casually chatting with me. Her glove was covered in blood and mucus, which she showed me like it was something I should be proud of, and I've been bleeding and contracting since then, about an hour ago. I'm trying to stay calm because I know this is normal and will probably taper off soon, but the doctor seemed hopeful that I won't go past my due date. I'll believe it when it's happening, sister.

Also, my belly continues to measure small. The doctor seemed totally unconcerned since I'm feeling plenty of movement and baby's heart rate is fine, but I was really worried, so I'm finally getting a growth scan!

Just had my doctor&#39;s appointment, and had her do a cervical check since I&#39;ve been having cramps and pressure. At 36 weeks, my cervix was closed but soft. I thought to myself at the time, these cervical checks are not so bad! Why does everyone complain about them? Well, it turns out to be a whole different story when they can actually get a finger or two in there. Today, I was dilated 2-3 cm and 80% effaced, and HOLY SHIT did that hurt. She got two fingers and there, and it caused a contraction...which was way worse than any of the cramping I&#39;ve been having so far. Takeaway: if that was only a small contraction, I&#39;m definitely getting an epidural! All the while, she was just casually chatting with me. Her glove was covered in blood and mucus, which she showed me like it was something I should be proud of, and I&#39;ve been bleeding and contracting since then, about an hour ago. I&#39;m trying to stay calm because I know this is normal and will probably taper off soon, but the doctor seemed hopeful that I won&#39;t go past my due date. I&#39;ll believe it when it&#39;s happening, sister.</p>

<p>Also, my belly continues to measure small. The doctor seemed totally unconcerned since I&#39;m feeling plenty of movement and baby&#39;s heart rate is fine, but I was really worried, so I&#39;m finally getting a growth scan! Hopefully we can get in at MFM before next Monday. I&#39;m excited to see baby again, but also worried that something is wrong. </p>

<p>What a morning.</p>

I did come across the ending a wanted pregnancy website earlier today and will look at it more closely. 

I'm no way as depressed as I was with our miscarriage. I'm just so hell bent on finding out what happened. I work in a genetics nhs lab so I understand inheritance and all that. I think I'm still in shock truth be told. I remember saying to my husband (then bf) what if we couldn't have children? And saying how common mc was without giving one thought that we would be in one of those categories. 

The drs keep saying at least we know you can conceive. But I find it pretty unhelpful, what's the point in saying that if I can't carry a healthy baby? I just can't believe we've had to go through loss twice, I've had to go through surgery twice, we've had to let go of little balloons with messages written to our lost baby twice.

And ppl say I'm much better this time round, I'm just better at coping, better at keeping the mask on. I won't tumble into depression again, it messed my cycles up so badly, so I'm marching on. Onto possible genetic testing and karyotyping. 

What else can I do? We can only go forward or be stuck in grief. I've been stuck before, in a world that's very dark I couldn't see. I will not be pulled into that world again. I'd break if I did.

So, I had planned that I would go this morning to get my thyroid tested. But to do so, you gotta be fasting... I woke up at 4am (as usual) starving, but I thought to myself surely I can wait a few hours. So I toss and turn in my bed unable to fall back asleep. By 5 am my belly is rumbling and I'm starting to feel almost pain from hunger. At 5.30am I'm considering just getting up and eating something and doing the blood test on Thursday, but alas I preserve longer by fantasizing about eating bananas. By 6 am I'm thinking that I should have just eaten something at 4 am and gone to the lab later because by then it would have been as though I'd been fasting. At 6.30 I start browsing reddit but I'm sooooooo hungry that reddit annoys me. At 6.45 I give up. I can no longer take it, I feel as if my belly (that's been super bloated for weeks) is actually indenting inwards, can't take it. I get up and excitedly walk downstairs to the kitchen. I will finally have food in my belly. I pick up strawberry yogurt and sit down on the couch eating it spoon by spoon it while... simultaneously gagging - because nausea. My fluffy kitty is prancing on the couch purring contentedly. I mange to eat like half of the yogurt when the gagging turns into dry heaving which turns into me running to the toilet and vomiting a bit. Well.. I put the yogurt away and walk upstairs to the main bathroom to brush my teeth, but it turns out my dear cat who's been so happily purring next to me seconds ago, had actually pooped before that (that's probably why she was so happy) and the smell makes me vomit into the sink... then off into the toilet. All the yogurt was now gone. I go back to bed, dissatisfied and still hungry, but .. at least now I can still go for the blood test because I've gotten rid of all the food. I actually manage to fall asleep because I'm exhausted from the puking. Wake up at 8.30am, get ready for work - but I feel sooo weak and so hungry that I just can't do the blood test. Once at work, the first thing I do is order a cheese toast from the cafeteria and I swear it's the best toast I've ever had (had it before). Later on, I get a short break and I order another cheese toast and it's glorious. 

I honestly have no idea how women manage it when they're hungry and nauseous at the same time. Or how they manage to fast before a blood test when they wake up in the middle of the night starving. 

I have learned some things: 

1. (the smell of) tiger balm is amazing when you're nauseous. I recommend it.
2. when you're hungry - eat. Don't postpone it. It's just gonna make things worse.
3. yogurts suck and cheese toasties rock. (there goes my healthy, keto diet)
4. oh, and belly bands rock. My bloat is seriously something to be proud of after wolfing down these cheese toasties, and the belly band makes it so that I'm totally comfortable in my work pants (they are completely unzipped).

If you can, just take time to grieve your loss, and take it in baby steps from there. Your doctor will likely continue to monitor your HSG to make sure it starts coming back down, (and if they don't, I'd say you should request weekly monitoring), and if it doesn't, then they will start working on a game plan to treat for ectopic. But you should also rest assured that at 4 weeks, the embryo is still so small that you aren't yet at risk of complications. Even if it does turn out to be ectopic, this means you caught it early, and you will be able to address it before it causes any damage.

I really understand how you feel right now. I too feel like the strong one for my husband. My father in law just died from a combo of Parkinson's, cancer, and old age. I'm ""the strong one"" because I lost my dad in 2013 to cancer and our son recently, so I'm here supporting my husband and in Laws since they've never had a loss before in their huge family. 

I think we are strong because we've been through pregnancy loss and we can sort of accept death as a part of life and even an unfair, random incident. My husband still sees it as a cycle and thinks our son's stillbirth was a ""natural"" cause (it helps him cope, whatever, but I don't think that at all). I think we acknowledge more that death is unfair, chaotic, and something we have no choice but to accept if we want to survive! You've been through a lot of pain and I bet you've grieved much more than your husband has, so in a way you are more emotionally ""prepared"" than he is. I know my husband's grief is now manifesting both for his dad and our son because he really pushed it away when it was fresh.

Anyway I'm trying to tell you beyond all my rambling that you're not alone. We are strong due to circumstance but also due to choice. We could be the weaker ones in the equation who have had enough of death and loss to last a lifetime. But we choose not to be! And from a conception standpoint the SMEP is frustrating me too because my ovulation tests were dark lines but never ""positive""...I had flashing smileys on advanced and very dark lines on the digital ones, along with egg white CM, but they kept showing negative. I think my surge is quick or something. We're trying to BD every other day too. But it's Hard with my husband's grief and all the funeral stuff going on.

OH, also, don't put too much pressure on yourself to be the strong one, even though you are naturally. I had it yesterday with supporting everybody and just retreated from the crowd for a bit, and I've been really grieving my son alone at night to properly get it out...because it's nice to have all this grief empathy going on but it's also draining in large doses. So please try to take care of yourself in between all of this madness.

I really understand how you feel right now. I too feel like the strong one for my husband. My father in law just died from a combo of Parkinson&#39;s, cancer, and old age. I&#39;m &quot;the strong one&quot; because I lost my dad in 2013 to cancer and our son recently, so I&#39;m here supporting my husband and in Laws since they&#39;ve never had a loss before in their huge family. </p>

<p>I think we are strong because we&#39;ve been through pregnancy loss and we can sort of accept death as a part of life and even an unfair, random incident. My husband still sees it as a cycle and thinks our son&#39;s stillbirth was a &quot;natural&quot; cause (it helps him cope, whatever, but I don&#39;t think that at all). I think we acknowledge more that death is unfair, chaotic, and something we have no choice but to accept if we want to survive! You&#39;ve been through a lot of pain and I bet you&#39;ve grieved much more than your husband has, so in a way you are more emotionally &quot;prepared&quot; than he is. I know my husband&#39;s grief is now manifesting both for his dad and our son because he really pushed it away when it was fresh.</p>

We were also unable to find any reasons as to why, but my doctor warned us that was likely. We did the amniocentesis, placenta testing, and my blood testing. The only thing we opted out was the autopsy. 

My endo increased my brand Synthroid dose from 100mcg to 112mcg as soon as I found out I was pregnant (3 weeks).

* the group text...really? They don't know I'm expecting again and come the f*uck on - even if I they knew that, I've had 5 losses and that pain doesn't just go away. Do I need to be bombarded with replies all night because of everyone being so excited? Sigh. Some sensitivity might have been nice.

* *I* am pregnant and their due date is so close....if I get to actually have a kid it ""steals some thunder"" from my FINALLY having one. 
* And another reason about due dates - what if I lose mine and she keeps hers? Eek. Or even the other way around. RAWR

The burial was yesterday and the really nice thing was that they buried him near my dad and son's graves. My husband lost it when he visited my son's grave yesterday.

But the ache in my heart for a living baby is a million times more now, and for my husband too. We obviously skipped two days of BD and I think it was my most fertile time but we covered last night because he told me he really wants me to get pregnant.

I also met new people and heard a few more babyloss stories. I recently heard of a woman whose six month old died of SIDs. There was another woman I met at the viewing who had a lovely young toddler; I envied her, then I learned she had a miscarriage before at 16 weeks. My sister in law was at the hospital before she came to town and she met a nurse who had a stillborn daughter 23 years ago.

A woman I really like, the sister of one of my sister in laws, told me how difficult her two pregnancies were. Her kids were both premature--her first son was born normally but his lungs collapsed at 9 months. She was pregnant with her second while this happened. With her second son, she went into preterm labor at 4 months and remained on bed rest and medication for her contractions until she had him also as a preemie. Luckily for her they both survived but she discovered she has Factor V Leiden after that. I guess a lot of people have stories to tell. Stillbirths are still rare but I'm learning from many people that pregnancies are much more complicated and crazy than they appear to be, we just don't really talk about it.

Edited to add: I don't think I mentioned this story before: my husband's cousin had 8 miscarriages in a row before she conceived her living son, who's now an annoying but healthy teenager. Her family has a genetic problem. Another one of her family members had a baby girl last year who died of a heart defect at a few months old--she's pregnant now with a baby boy and she has a living girl.

As for ""knowing"", I am not sure anyone ever knows for sure.  There are so many factors, both physically and emotionally...but even more so emotionally. The worry during  TTC after loss is hard, but pregnancy after loss is incredibly hard -- its an emotional and mental battle every day (for many people). So you have to feel strong enough to deal with that...and to try to appreciate the pregnancy and be happy, so that you don't go crazy. You also should consider that you should try to be in a mental place where another loss won't turn your life upside down and send you into a downward spiral. Multiple losses are hard, but having them close together is incredibly tough. Of course we hope and pray it never happens again, but we can't control that.

All of that sounds scary and like you'll NEVER feel good enough to try. But here is the biggest thing -- you have to have a desire for a baby that is greater than your sadness and worry. That desire is what has kept me going -- the heartache is terrible and has changed our lives. But we want a child so very much.

I hope you are able to come to terms with your grief and anxiety and decide on a good time. But make sure its what YOU want. 8 months may seem like a long time and others may think you should be over it...but you lost a very wanted baby/pregnancy - nobody ""gets over that"" fully, ever. Its ok to grieve. And its entirely normal to worry about the future outcomes -- but you can't control them.

I'm in my second cycle after our Little Passenger was diagnosed with anencephaly at our 12 week scan, we had to terminate the pregnancy via surgery. In addition, in Dec 2015 we had a missed miscarriage with our Little Bean. 

I still can't really believe we've lost two babies. I'm now waiting for a genetics appointment to discuss whether I am entitled to genetic testing or not. I work in a genetics diagnostics lab so I've been pushing hard to get in the system. 

For now I've been prescribed 5mg folic acid after the anencephaly and we are now in the tww of our second cycle. I think. My cf became watery but I only get the tiniest bit of egg white. So I wouldn't be surprised if I didn't ov this month and my cycle drags on like after the miscarriage. 

It's so frustrating, I wouldn't mind not being preg as long as my cycles became regular again. The first cycle after surgery was 30 days after the bleeding had stopped so that's one positive I suppose. I was a regular 30 day girl before all this happened. 

I just still came believe it, we should have an 18 month old and one on the way right now. Why is life so cruel to take them away?

Less positively, I'm feeling a bit down whenever family or certain friends bring up babies, but not directly because of the losses.  A common topic is that I'm going to be 35 this year so if we want to have children, we should stop playing around and have the children now.  One friend said I should start trying by next year so that I can have a kid by the time on 37, and then another before I'm 40.  All reasonable points, but it's like they simply assume that husband and I aren't aware of our ages or the inherent risks and fertility concerns.  To be fair, we haven't told anyone about our losses because that's just going to invite a deluge of unsolicited advice on how we should change our diets, lectures on how our diets in the past are now coming to bite us in the ass, or declarations that we've waited too long and we'll never have children.  I feel like whenever the topic comes up the only answer is to nod, smile, and say something like, ""Oh well, if it happens it happens"" and make no mention whatsoever of the two CPs.  But really, I want to tell everyone to STFU because we *have* been trying but the it just hasn't worked out so will they just kindly cease flapping their gums because it is not helping.

Another common topic that comes up if why husband and I are going to continue renting rather than just buying a house right away because buying is going to save us so much money in the long term.  And while we're at it, we should move closer to my parents--like next door--so they can help with babysitting, which will further save us money.  I get it that if we are in a position to buy and have a location we both agree on, yes buying makes sense.  But all of our savings will be just enough to cover a down payment in our city, leaving us with no emergency funds let alone renovation funds.  Plus, what if we really can't have children and choose to not seek out IVF/surrogacy/adoption?  The type of home we'd buy in that situation will be very different than if we do have children.

Anyway, I've just been feeling like I can't even share anything exciting with friends or family -- like the apartment viewing next week -- without having to sit through judgment.  I understand that people may ask questions or they genuinely mean well by bringing up things that they think we might not have considered.  I don't want to get bratty about it, but it was just so hurtful after our first loss, and now it's just plain annoying.

I got the order to schedule my anatomy scan between 18-20 weeks, which just feels so surreal.

Yeah, it's cheesy, but we are just so excited and I can't turn down an excuse for cake.

I also decided to get the Quad screening done to try and ease some worry. It is hard trying to keep my anxiety under control, and since I didn't do the NT scan (super expensive because insurance wouldn't cover it), I want some sort of genetic testing before I go in for my anatomy scan.

My main complaint at this point is just how achy my body is. The top of my ribs under my breasts hurt so much. And so does my lower back. I've stopped running because it hurts my back so much, but I'm in the pool and on the bike trainer everyday to try and stay active.

Pitocin started at 5 am, made it until 10 am before I opted into the epidural. They broke my water very early on, which erupted like in the movies! All that extra fluid. I'm glad we got that one ""traditional"" labor moment, because things didn't go according to plan. Baby's heart rate was dipping with contractions- nothing too low or too long (they never had to push the emergency button). But then around 2-3 my progress stalled at thinned out but 6/7 cm. We waited a couple hours, but said she wasn't seeing what she wanted, and not knowing how long it'd be before we started progressing again combined with the heart rate deceleration, she was recommending a c-section. If I'd been more dilated they'd have recommended labor, but the c-section was the best option to get him out while he was still looking good and before any potential issues could arrive. I was terrified. I wanted to experience birth and labor, and avoid surgery I was awake for. Plus my epidural had started failing on the left side so I was worried about pain. 

But we agreed, and all of the sudden, despite it not being an emergency c-sect there were tons of people in the room, and about 20 minutes later I was in the OR. I was shaking horribly, which was honestly the worst part. I was terrified. My husband was great though. Before I even knew they began, they were pushing on my upper torso saying ""we see the head, shoulders, butt, look at his chubby cheeks!"". And he whimpered right away. We cried. Many times I thought I'd never actually meet him. Apgar of 8 and 9, loud crier. Nice and round and plump since he didn't really spend any time in the birth canal. Pediatrics says he looks great. Born at 4:37 pm. 

No NICU time, though I have to stay til at least Saturday and am really sore at the incision. It was so hard not getting to hold him at first, and being scared to hold him due to the shaking. I'm glad we didn't allow a flood of visitors right away, as at first I think I was so overwhelmed and scared and hadn't gotten the skin to skin I was worried... that I wasn't excited enough? But spending all afternoon,  night and morning with him has been amazing, and I was up all night just holding and checking on him. He's perfect. When he was just born I'd been through 10 hours of labor, an unplanned major surgery a partially failed epidural, and a baby, so I just am reminding myself how crazy that all is. I'm so happy he is here. He's fuzzy all over! He has loud lungs and was a champion latched at first, but breastfeeding is work. My nipples are pretty flat so that's not helping. Can't wait to take him home. Expecting plenty of visitors today.

In a couple weeks it will be the anniversary of my first loss. This sub has helped me immeasurably, and I'll miss you all.

Pitocin started at 5 am, made it until 10 am before I opted into the epidural. They broke my water very early on, which erupted like in the movies! All that extra fluid. I&#39;m glad we got that one &quot;traditional&quot; labor moment, because things didn&#39;t go according to plan. Baby&#39;s heart rate was dipping with contractions- nothing too low or too long (they never had to push the emergency button). But then around 2-3 my progress stalled at thinned out but 6/7 cm. We waited a couple hours, but said she wasn&#39;t seeing what she wanted, and not knowing how long it&#39;d be before we started progressing again combined with the heart rate deceleration, she was recommending a c-section. If I&#39;d been more dilated they&#39;d have recommended labor, but the c-section was the best option to get him out while he was still looking good and before any potential issues could arrive. I was terrified. I wanted to experience birth and labor, and avoid surgery I was awake for. Plus my epidural had started failing on the left side so I was worried about pain. </p>

<p>But we agreed, and all of the sudden, despite it not being an emergency c-sect there were tons of people in the room, and about 20 minutes later I was in the OR.
