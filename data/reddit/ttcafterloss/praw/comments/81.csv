My experience with endocrinologists is that they tend to just treat based off of tsh/t3 and don’t care so much about antibodies. If you can’t see an endo right now, you might want to seek out a rheumatologist and see if they can see you sooner to rule out any autoimmune disease.</p>

Grief

as for grief, you'll find it comes in waves. When the ship is first wrecked, you're drowning, with wreckage all around you. Everything floating around you reminds you of the beauty and the magnificence of the ship that was, and is no more. And all you can do is float. You find some piece of the wreckage and you hang on for a while. Maybe it's some physical thing. Maybe it's a happy memory or a photograph. Maybe it's a person who is also floating. For a while, all you can do is float. Stay alive.

In the beginning, the waves are 100 feet tall and crash over you without mercy. They come 10 seconds apart and don't even give you time to catch your breath. All you can do is hang on and float. After a while, maybe weeks, maybe months, you'll find the waves are still 100 feet tall, but they come further apart. When they come, they still crash all over you and wipe you out. But in between, you can breathe, you can function. You never know what's going to trigger the grief. It might be a song, a picture, a street intersection, the smell of a cup of coffee. It can be just about anything...and the wave comes crashing. But in between waves, there is life.

Somewhere down the line, and it's different for everybody, you find that the waves are only 80 feet tall. Or 50 feet tall. And while they still come, they come further apart. You can see them coming. An anniversary, a birthday, or Christmas, or landing at O'Hare. You can see it coming, for the most part, and prepare yourself. And when it washes over you, you know that somehow you will, again, come out the other side. Soaking wet, sputtering, still hanging on to some tiny piece of the wreckage, but you'll come out. Take it from an old guy. The waves never stop coming, and somehow you don't really want them to. But you learn that you'll survive them. And other waves will come. And you'll survive them too. If you're lucky, you'll have lots of scars from lots of loves. And lots of shipwrecks.",[],,t1_eyxkn6h,False,0,[],False,"<div class=""md""><p>I’m so sorry, if you want to share more about Giovanna please feel free to PM.

To expand a bit on my flair, my first three losses were CPs with my first husband; he is also the father of my LC, which was the result of pregnancy #2. My other two losses have been with my current husband; he has several LC from his first marriage and no losses with any other partner (that he knows of). Obviously, the more recent losses with Husband #2 are different in profile to the losses with Husband #1. I'm no longer sure how much I should consider those three CPs in deciding how to move forward, especially since I had a lot of difficulty conceiving with Husband #1 while Husband #2 and I have (so far) conceived very easily; I think those CPs might have happened for a completely different reason (maybe).

After my 4th miscarriage earlier this year, we went to an RE who did an infertility workup and an RPL panel. The good news that is that my FSH, AMH, AFC, etc. are great for my age (I'm 38). I had an HSG and a saline sonogram and both came back normal. (I do have a uterine fibroid but it's apparently not in a place that would interfere with implantation, etc.) For this last pregnancy, I was on progesterone until week 10. (This was my first time supplementing with progesterone.) My only bloodwork that came back abnormal was Vitamin D, and it was really low, so I was on supplements for that too, starting about a month before my positive HPT. (Unfortunately, I stopped taking them around week 9 because I had hyperemesis and could no longer swallow pills, so that's on my list of Things I Wish I'd Done Differently That Might Have Kept My Baby Alive.)

We are going back to the RE in October. By then, we should have the genetic testing results from our most recent loss.  I have a feeling that if the results are abnormal, the RE is going to recommend IVF with PGS testing. (This seemed to be the direction he was leaning in before I got pregnant with the most recent loss.)

Here are the RPL blood tests I've had run (everything came back within normal ranges):

\-Lupus anti-coagulants (PTT-LA, dRVVT)

\-Anticardiolipins Ab IgG, IgA, and IgM

\-Beta-2 Glycoprotein I Ab IgG and IgM

\-Hemoglobin A1c (to check for undiagnosed diabetes)

\-Karyotyping

Does anyone know if there are any other blood tests that I should have done? I'm especially interested in checking for more rare clotting disorders or thrombophilias. And even if that testing doesn't exist or comes back normal, I wonder if it's not a bad idea to treat me for one prophylactically. (I may be grasping at straws here, but when I was pregnant with my LC I was on peripheral IVs pretty much continuously from week 9 to 15 and periodically after that, so I was getting doses of heparin frequently -- could that be why that pregnancy was successful?) 

I'm also curious if anyone has any insight as to a possible ""common cause"" of losses that are happening at different stages of pregnancy. (For the MMC at 13 weeks, the baby measured 11+5.)

It's a heartbreaking choice and there is almost always never a clear right answer, only hard choices. You absolutely belong here, whether you decide to carry until she passes naturally (either in utero or after birth) or if you decide to terminate. There are a few of us here who terminated for medical reasons so you wouldn't be alone if that's the route you choose to take. 

In my case terminated a little over 4 weeks ago for severe congenital diaphragmatic hernia at 22 weeks. Our baby had no measurable amount of left lung and her right lung was 13% of the size it should have been, more than likely too small to support her even with a ventilator, and if she survived she likely would have had long term disabilities simply due to the interventions that would be required to keep her alive. I realized that while I was terrified that my daughter would die, I was more terrified that she would live, albeit with disabilities that would leave her in misery for her (probably short) life. As badly as I wanted to hold her, I knew that the longer she grew inside me the greater her capacity for suffering would become. We decided to give her peace.  

We didn't have any genetic testing done until our anatomy scan was abnormal, but ultimately no genetic cause was found (we had FSH, a karyotype and a microarray done) so our baby girl's CDH was likely just environmental, an accident of nature. Sometimes they don't find a cause. It could be that the early results of your genetic testing came back normal (the FSH test), but the quickest tests usually only look for the most common aneuploidies. The more in-depth tests take longer. We actually didn't get the results for the microarray until after my D&E, because we knew that our baby would likely not survive whether she had genetic abnormalities or not.  

There is no wrong or right answer to whether to terminate or decide to carry to term (or as long as you can). Once we decided to terminate I had a D&E because statistically it has the lowest risk of complications and I was able to be anesthetized/asleep for it, and I already had a living child at home to take care of. But sometimes I do find myself wishing I had instead chose to induce labor so that I could have maybe seen and held our baby, but I also know that may have been traumatic for me. Some women might find it healing. Some don't get a choice. Whatever you do, take any mementos (pictures or footprints) you're offered. I don't think you'll regret having them.  

If you choose to terminate there is also a support group on Facebook you could join called Ending a Wanted Pregnancy. It's specifically for parents who have had to terminate pregnancies for medical reasons, either due to severe defects or for the health of the mother.

In my opinion, termination is a kind choice. You will save your child from suffering, and you will not have to suffer through months of carrying a child you know will not make it. But carrying your child is also a valid choice. You will be able to have her for a longer period of time, and cherish the time you have left. You may be able to hold and comfort her in her last moments.

I know it's a hard decision, but either way you will be doing the best you can for your daughter. These are the hard choices most parents never have to face, and like in all parenting, there is no one right answer.

My only suggestion would be that if you choose to terminate, please make sure they make you a keepsake, foot prints or something tangible for you to treasure. Maybe go to a boutique ultrasound place for high quality 3D prints or video. It will help.

If the pregnant coworker announces her baby on those days it’s going to be a gut wrenching day. I know it’s too early to think about that. But I want so desperately to be pregnant. It’s our third cycle trying again. That’s how long it took for Rowan. I’m just ... how do I not obsess these last 8-9 days?


I start riding lessons on the 5th, part of me doesn’t want to. Because every time I go there I’m going to be reminded I’m not pregnant. I also don’t want to worry that riding is screwing up implantation (it’ll be 8DPO, so it’s not like I can even test properly that day, but I probably will).

Also, it totally sounds like you have PCOS!  I'd talk to your doctor about it if I were you!  Metformin can reduce those excess androgens (there's a binding relationship between insulin and testosterone: less insulin = less free testosterone) and improve egg quality.  Your OB may want to do some testing for blood sugar and insulin before giving you metformin, but it's definitely worth it to do the testing! You can also have a similar effect by eating a low carb diet - there's even a diet called the PCOS diet!  Your doctor should also be testing you for prolactin and thyroid issues, since these can mimic PCOS symptoms!

May: Surge day 11, cycle length only 22 days (this one was bizarre, I'd been tracking cycle length for a year and never had such a short cycle)

June: Surge day 15, cycle length 27 days.

July: Surge day 12, cycle length 24 days.

August: Surge day 15, TW finally got a BFP

So for me, my first cycle was clearly off, but then things seemed to return to normal.

I am so sorry things are taking awhile for you to go back to normal, though your timeline is not too different from mine. My MMC was in March and it wasn't until June that I had a normal cycle. I felt the same way you do - I was desperate to get pregnant again and so frustrated that it was taking awhile to get my cycles regular. It really prolonged the grieving process for me.

I will say, after reading your posts below, that it might be worth another ultrasound. After my first d&c I had horrible episodes of bleeding (you can see my post history for details). Anyways, I had a saline ultrasound and guided d&c to get the last of what remained, and I'm grateful I did - the bizarre bleeding stopped and my cycles started to return. If you end up needing one, I'll just note that the second d&c they used only manual vacuum aspiration and I was awake the whole time (extremely painful but worth it to avoid a hospital/anesthesia again), which I'd recommend.

<p>May: Surge day 11, cycle length only 22 days (this one was bizarre, I&#39;d been tracking cycle length for a year and never had such a short cycle)</p>

<p>June: Surge day 15, cycle length 27 days.</p>

<p>July: Surge day 12, cycle length 24 days.</p>

<p>August: Surge day 15, TW finally got a BFP</p>

<p>So for me, my first cycle was clearly off, but then things seemed to return to normal.</p>

<p>I am so sorry things are taking awhile for you to go back to normal, though your timeline is not too different from mine. My MMC was in March and it wasn&#39;t until June that I had a normal cycle. I felt the same way you do - I was desperate to get pregnant again and so frustrated that it was taking awhile to get my cycles regular. It really prolonged the grieving process for me.</p>

<p>I will say, after reading your posts below, that it might be worth another ultrasound. After my first d&amp;c I had horrible episodes of bleeding (you can see my post history for details). Anyways, I had a saline ultrasound and guided d&amp;c to get the last of what remained, and I&#39;m grateful I did - the bizarre bleeding stopped and my cycles started to return. If you end up needing one, I&#39;ll just note that the second d&amp;c they used only manual vacuum aspiration and I was awake the whole time (extremely painful but worth it to avoid a hospital/anesthesia again), which I&#39;d recommend.</p>

<p>Feel free to PM me if I can be helpful at all.</p>

It’s painful to have it in the house and taking up all that space. Keep a few things maybe for when your little one gets older that are special to you, and the rest can go.</p>

<p>Of course, asking someone how they are is the most basic social interaction and she did nothing wrong. She’s very nice. I’m not mad at her. Just at life I guess. Moody day. </p>

<p>I have my first creative writing class tonight and I’ve been so excited but my random crap mood is really killing me today.</p>

<p>Castor oil packs somehow make your internal systems run again. It will kick-start your cycle when placed over your uterus. Not sure how it works but people have been using them for thousands of years. I used it again for my second miscarriage, except I didn’t wait this time, and I think everything came out (going to doc today, will update with the results).</p>

So when I hit 6 months I was 35 at the time) she actually was able to do some of the bloodwork and took a look, which was not billed through my insurance as infertility treatment. My husband also did his initial bloodwork with his primary care so it was billed as infertility. We do have fertility coverage but it has a lifetime max so it was important we did what we could to keep from reaching it. That might be a place for you to get started. Unfortunately in my case the problem wasn’t discovered till more in depth testing found out both my tubes are completely blocked and I was given a 3% of ever conceiving on my own. </p>

My husband tries to remind me of all the good in our life and to be thankful for all that we have, and it's true, I am thankful for those things, but I just feel like that's separate from the giant hole in my heart that the losses have left. 

During the first break I had a hard time giving a crap about anything. I was content just sitting on my butt, staring at reddit all day and ordering pizza daily.

What helped me get through it was my husband. He took initiative on the things that I usually do, like preparing dinner. He'd come up with our meal plans, make the grocery lists, get dinner started. He doesn't really cook, but he'd get the ball rolling then ask me for help. Getting the ball rolling was the hardest part for me, so that was SUPER helpful.

He didn't put any pressure on me to come up with things to do, or to clean the house or anything. He worked really hard to just start these things and then involve me afterwards and that helped.

The break was so hard at first, because all I wanted was to be pregnant again, but after a little bit I got into the swing of it. Focused on doing some yard work and house projects and I stopped thinking about TTC constantly because I couldn't do it anyways. Taking a break reminded me what it felt like to not be totally obsessed with it, and that felt good.

Maybe try talking to your husband about how you're feeling and see if he can help guide you when you're feeling like you just give no shits. Ask him to take the lead on life for a little bit, if he's able to do that, and include you in small ways.

<p>And it all started before the miscarriage. I was left on my own to go to doctor, sitting home because now I’d not do a long hike, etc. I’ve never thought he might be so different of what I used to know him for.</p>

I'm so sorry.

So I'm going to tackle a couple of your questions.

After my miscarriages, I struggled with infertility as well so I really distanced myself from pregnant people. The ones who were my friends understood, the ones who didn't understand, weren't my friends.

Both of my SILs got pregnant while I was still struggling to conceive again and both were very understanding of why I was not very involved in their pregnancies.

As for miscarrying at home, I would advise you get the D&C. It's a very personal choice, but I miscarried at home. It started with hours of contractions and then so much bleeding that I could not leave the toilet. Not even with max pads. I ended up in the ER and bled through my pants while waiting. They ended up putting an adult diaper on me. It turned out that my cervix was clogged with tissue and trying so so so hard to expel it which is where all the blood was coming from. They pulled out what they could and the bleeding went down significantly.

I was so sore i could barely sit up for a couple days and for an entire week i wanted to die every time i sneezed. I had to take pain pills to go to sleep because they prescribed me Misoprostal to make sure that all the tissue made it's way out.

It is NOT something i will ever do again. 

If you do decide to do it at home please please make sure you are not alone. 

I am anemic, but I don't think that had anything to do with my experience. I also actually have the opposite problem with clotting and have to take blood thinners.

I want you to know because I didn’t have anyone to ask when it happened to me.

My MC happened at 7+6. It was happening while I was getting the ultrasound. No heartbeat but the embryo measured 7+6, so it was kinda happening real-time.

I was in pain before and for hours after the ultrasound. Heavy bleeding (not hemorrhaging, just like the worst period I ever had), backpain, severe cramps, and I also had contractions. Painful cramps that lasted intervals. Nobody ever told me that miscarriages could hurt so much (nobody talks much about them until you ask, it sadly seems). I wasn’t expecting the pain, emotional and physical. All for a teeny 7+6 little bean (we got to see an ultrasound).

It was not unbearable, by any means. But, it was fucking awful. Tbh, I think I may have even passed naturally at home, at some point before my D&C (which was scheduled the following morning). There were still contractions, minor cramping in the waiting room the next day.

But, the OB surgeon (and the nurses!) was sooooo incredibly nice to me. Informative, gentle, everything I needed at that moment. The procedure was performed with sedatives and the twilight drug. I remember nothing but peace. I vaguely remember waking because I was talking about what books I wanted to read over the summer with the attending nurse while my eyes were still closed (embarrassing to realize you were having convos without realizing it, coming off the drugs!) but where, for the last 48 hours all I could think of was inner turmoil and pain - my baby was gone - to wake up talking about books was like a little gift of peace in the days of grief.

I took the option, because I was afraid of how long the MC would take (days?!) and the pain. The truth was - I probably could have gone without it - I think I neared the brunt of it on my own... but I’m glad I had it. There was no leftover tissue to pass, or risk infection.

A few things that helped:  
\- I have an incredible husband who, even though he was reeling from our loss, prioritized my wellness.  
\- I got my ass to yoga 3-4 times per week. The hot yoga I do helps me shut off my brain, so I got an hour-long break from thinking about the devastation.  
\- I talked about the miscarriage with close friends a lot. They helped me feel seen and that our baby wasn't forgotten.  
\- I gave myself permission to feel joy when it came back. Guilt came with it, but reminding myself that I deserve joy was a big step.  


Honestly, it sucks, but time helped. It took 9 weeks for my period to come back, and I just about gave up that it ever would. That rock bottom helped me move on.

I admit I ping-ponged between hours on the internet looking for other women's stories (how I found this community) and taking breaks. In fact, I had to give myself time off this sub just because it would sometimes pull me back under.

<p>In an effort to be &quot;healthy&quot; and to lose weight, I impulsively signed up for a half marathon so I&#39;ve kept myself busy with that. Honestly, it&#39;s brought me more stress than anything because I&#39;m not a fantastic runner so I just worry that I&#39;m going to be a total loser on race day. </p>

<p>I&#39;m not totally sure I have advice? I have been trying to read books that my mom has sent me so we can talk about that. I have looked for a therapist because of the anger and bitterness I have about my situation. I started journaling more and bullet journaling and using a planner as some way of taking control of at least part of my life. </p>

<p>I also really don&#39;t care about a lot of stuff. I just want to be pregnant. I just want to feel that way again and I simply cannot wait until I am pregnant again. And I hate this feeling. &lt;3</p>

I think it can be much more painful than the drs let on, and I felt like I would be more vulnerable at home and in pain once it started than in a hospital. The d&c itself was as smooth as possible. The hospital staff from the anesthesiologists to the nurses couldn’t have been more compassionate.

I’ve had two first trimester losses - the first was sad but not devastating, and the second was devastating with real grief, compounded by the anxiety of now doing fertility testing and not knowing what or when the path forward will be. Also grieving the ability to have a normal-person’s level of hope and happiness in my next pregnancy. 

We had a lot of friends in the loop who knew about both pregnancies and losses, and knew how broken up we were after this recent one. We got texts and email replies of condolence, but what would have been really meaningful for me is cards in the mail, or homemade cookies or baked goods. A small flower arrangement or plant. A surprise in the mail or dropped off on our doorstep. Even a surprise visit from a friend. Or a local friend saying, “hey, I know you may not be up for it, but do you wanna hang out his weekend?”

It’s a little bit like how when your pet dies, and the only person to send a sympathy card is the vet. And it reminds you that no one else in your life sent anything.

After this recent loss, I had one friend send a card and the fact that she thought of it was so meaningful I cried. She just wrote a few sentences on the back of a funny picture. It was silly and quirky and made me laugh but also expressed that she knew this was really hard and that she’s there for us. Exactly the right tone. 

I found myself wishing so much that other friends did little things like send cards that I asked strangers to send me cards in r/randomactsofcards. I feel kind of silly asking for that, but it’s a thing people do for all sorts of reasons, and people seem to enjoy it. I know I’ll enjoy returning the favor to the community eventually. And when the cards start coming, I know they will brighten my day and make me feel like people care, even if they are strangers who just like to send mail.

I know that some people, especially those who have had later losses, want people to use their baby’s name, and talk about him or her and ask to see photos if there are any. Basically keep the memory of the baby alive. Treat the baby like a person who existed.

Some people, like me, try to depersonalize the loss. I don’t want anyone referring to my losses as babies, because to me, they weren’t really babies yet. I called the first one “Ball of Cells” as an example. I don’t feel like I lost a person I knew - I never felt them kick, or saw an ultrasound photo that looked like a human. Did not know gender or have a name.

I think if you are unsure about how Clomid can help in your situation, the best thing to do is press your doctor for more information about why he/she thinks it will help in your case. I admit, it's not immediately obvious to me either why it would help, but they should be able to talk you through their reasons for suggesting it and how it can assist with egg quality. I'd also want to ask your doctor if that would increase your chances of multiples and what associated risks come along with that.  


Regarding the mental strain of pregnancy and waiting until November to try again, that's a tough call. Is it more stressful to try now with work being hectic, or to wait and feel like time is working against your egg quality? Could you find a middle ground, something like requesting to reduce your workload or drop down to part-time hours to help reduce your work stress? Would it be possible to utilize an anti-depressant or something like that to help reduce the anger/irritation you feel while pregnant? (I'm looking into anti-depressants right now because I'm not doing well after my last loss; if they help, I would consider using them during pregnancy as well, though I admit to having fears of how that would affect the pregnancy and baby.)

They have all been early so she&#39;s suspecting that something is making it difficult for the blastocysts to implant properly.</p>

I had my miscarriage about a month ago. I feel a lot of the things that you have said. I got very angry about walking around ""still bleeding from my miscarriage"" while I had to just go to the shops and work as though that wasn't happening.

Prior to knowing about the miscarriage (it was missed) I was deeply depressed (I think this is because my body knew what had happened and that's how it showed it, using hormones). I know this now because when I had the surgery it was like a switch in my brain and I felt different. I felt I had the capacity to laugh again (not that I felt like laughing), whereas prior to that I felt like a void inside of no emotion or joy, just a heaviness over my heart. I was completely unmotivated to do anything and just wanted to stay in bed all day. Since the miscarriage, I have been sad, I have been grieving, I have felt anxious and worthless, I have spent some days in bed, but I have not felt that void, or that life was too hard, or that I couldn't cope. It was hard when I was in it to see how different the depression was, it took me a while to realise.

The thing about depression is it can be very hormonal. When you have a miscarriage you are flooded with different hormones over a short period of time. I got depressed before the miscarriage, a few of my friends felt it after theirs.

I had contacted my local gp and asked for a referral by the time I found out about the miscarriage. I knew I couldn't face life feeling that way, I needed help. I also found a charity that gives free grief counselling since the miscarriage. I needed professional help to navigate it, I needed someone who understood it to guide me through.

There is a difference between depression and sadness/grief. Consider asking for professional help, it may get you the break you need.

As for the grief,  it's a process, it will take time to go through. We need to take time to absorb what has happened into our being, it leaves a deep invisible scar and it won't go away or shrink, but some days you might remember it's there or feel it more than normal. The important thing about scars is that they are healed wounds and it takes time for the wound to heal.

I am still working through how to absorb what has happened into my being, how to make sense of it in my brain and weave it into my story. I am healing.

With my first miscarriage it was easier because by the time I stopped bleeding, my tests were negative again. I think I bled for 8-9 days and had a few more days of spotting. I started testing around CD11 but I only ovulated CD19.

The friend replied how he’s so sorry. My husband replied back saying “that’s ok we can try again”. I dunno why, but that convo just stung. Like rather than having positive news that he can be proud of, it was another one of those sad news about me having a miscarriage. Which I freaking hate that word. It makes it sound like I did something wrong. I just wish there was some way to know that eventually I’ll have success, rather than this forever limbo of back to back MCs.</p>

We're thinking about starting next month, here's what I've done:

Mental health: I go to therapy every other week. We go to a support group every month. I started taking zoloft and am working on anti anxiety techniques and reducing my use of Ativan. I bought a few books on pregnancy after loss with chapters about deciding to try again. 

Physical: Started trying to get daily walks in and going to a rock gym every week. Keeping all psychiatry and MFM appointments. Getting my confirmation blood tests for antiphospholipid syndrome done on Friday. LOTS of reading about the medical side of everything and trying to understand my risks. Will need to make a hematology appointment before ttc.

Marriage/relationship: this one is really important. Trying to increase the quality time I spend with my husband and take time to talk about our worries, fears, grief, and hope.

Preconception: I started taking folic acid every day. I also bought opks and have started trying to understand my cycle this month since I'm new at this, too.

I’m also a social worker working in the area of prevention in Healthy Families which serves families with children from 0-3 years old.

This time it wasn’t a miscarriage and I’m at my limits too. The miscarriage was very very hard last time so I can and can’t imagine a second. I’m sorry you are dealing with two. 

As for coping, My whole team knows what I’m going through and it’s been helpful. It doesn’t mean we talk about it much or on a regular basis but it became a way to feel safe at work and to feel silently supported. I’m a supervisor so it was exceptionally hard for me to be vulnerable with my team but they really appreciated it and our cohesiveness has increased since. 

I found people judge when they don’t know...and when they know you are not an impenetrable fortress and that you are just as human as them, that gives room for empathy. We are social workers after all. I hope your work environment can support that, if not, I’d look for somewhere that does.

My manager also knows and while I feel bad asking for days, I do because that’s why we have them. Be real with your needs and don’t feel bad about it. My sup is helpful with her support. 

Also, understanding my limitations has been important. I took a year off of school to do these treatments. This was super hard to do but I’m not superwoman.

Also, When I see moms who don’t want their kids or too much negativity I am honest with myself and distance myself from it. Less radio news, less social media, less forums, less reading. More positivity, more happiness. I always need reassurance after a neg beta...

I’ve really envied my friend who was able to just concentrate on ttc too and who got pregnant but in reality, I think I’d just drive myself crazy with it if I only had that to do. So being somewhat busy is helpful to me.

This time though, after two embryos didn’t catch, i feel more resilient but I feel more confused than ever. I’m considering stopping for a bit or doing surrogacy with the last 4 embryos...and that has its own time after mourning the cycle, my inability to carry, my feelings that I’m less of a woman if I can’t carry... all of that has its time to mourn. 

I’d say take some time for yourself, see a therapist (I do every other week) and be real at work if you feel you can. It will create relief in part of your space (not with your clients obviously). And that can be helpful.

<p>Also, When I see moms who don’t want their kids or too much negativity I am honest with myself and distance myself from it. Less radio news, less social media, less forums, less reading. More positivity, more happiness. I always need reassurance after a neg beta...</p>

<p>I’ve really envied my friend who was able to just concentrate on ttc too and who got pregnant but in reality, I think I’d just drive myself crazy with it if I only had that to do. So being somewhat busy is helpful to me.</p>

<p>This time though, after two embryos didn’t catch, i feel more resilient but I feel more confused than ever. I’m considering stopping for a bit or doing surrogacy with the last 4 embryos...and that has its own time after mourning the cycle, my inability to carry, my feelings that I’m less of a woman if I can’t carry... all of that has its time to mourn. </p>

<p>I’d say take some time for yourself, see a therapist (I do every other week) and be real at work if you feel you can. It will create relief in part of your space (not with your clients obviously). And that can be helpful.</p>

<p>Today I’m home...processing. hugs. I’m sorry for your loss. I hope you can find some comfort and a way to create space for yourself.</p>

I don't know if it helps, but you're not alone. I felt the same way after my second. I started grief counseling. And I would take off work an entire day once a month. But for me the depression lasted a long time. The intensity has decreased, but it's still there. The following description of grief helped me understand what I was feeling. 
“Alright, here goes. I'm old. What that means is that I've survived (so far) and a lot of people I've known and loved did not. I've lost friends, best friends, acquaintances, co-workers, grandparents, mom, relatives, teachers, mentors, students, neighbors, and a host of other folks. I have no children, and I can't imagine the pain it must be to lose a child. But here's my two cents.
I wish I could say you get used to people dying. I never did. I don't want to. It tears a hole through me whenever somebody I love dies, no matter the circumstances. But I don't want it to ""not matter"". I don't want it to be something that just passes. My scars are a testament to the love and the relationship that I had for and with that person. And if the scar is deep, so was the love. So be it. Scars are a testament to life. Scars are a testament that I can love deeply and live deeply and be cut, or even gouged, and that I can heal and continue to live and continue to love. And the scar tissue is stronger than the original flesh ever was. Scars are a testament to life. Scars are only ugly to people who can't see.
As for grief, you'll find it comes in waves. When the ship is first wrecked, you're drowning, with wreckage all around you. Everything floating around you reminds you of the beauty and the magnificence of the ship that was, and is no more. And all you can do is float. You find some piece of the wreckage and you hang on for a while. Maybe it's some physical thing. Maybe it's a happy memory or a photograph. Maybe it's a person who is also floating. For a while, all you can do is float. Stay alive.
In the beginning, the waves are 100 feet tall and crash over you without mercy. They come 10 seconds apart and don't even give you time to catch your breath. All you can do is hang on and float. After a while, maybe weeks, maybe months, you'll find the waves are still 100 feet tall, but they come further apart. When they come, they still crash all over you and wipe you out. But in between, you can breathe, you can function. You never know what's going to trigger the grief. It might be a song, a picture, a street intersection, the smell of a cup of coffee. It can be just about anything...and the wave comes crashing. But in between waves, there is life.
Somewhere down the line, and it's different for everybody, you find that the waves are only 80 feet tall. Or 50 feet tall. And while they still come, they come further apart. You can see them coming. An anniversary, a birthday, or Christmas, or landing at O'Hare. You can see it coming, for the most part, and prepare yourself. And when it washes over you, you know that somehow you will, again, come out the other side. Soaking wet, sputtering, still hanging on to some tiny piece of the wreckage, but you'll come out.
Take it from an old guy. The waves never stop coming, and somehow you don't really want them to. But you learn that you'll survive them. And other waves will come. And you'll survive them too. If you're lucky, you'll have lots of scars from lots of loves. And lots of shipwrecks.”",[],,t1_ex5884p,False,0,[],False,"<div class=""md""><p>I&#39;m so sorry.

The pain for me has been like slightly worse and more consistent period pain. The pain was at its worst for me about 5 hours after taking the pills.

We went straight to the maximum dose of injectable meds - I responded well and got pregnant on the second IUI. I am now 20 weeks and so far so good.</p>
