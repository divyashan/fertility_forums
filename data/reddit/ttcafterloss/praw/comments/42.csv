Really rooting for you. ❤️ (Also not sure if this is helpful at all, but I just wanted to be supportive in some way. Hope I don&#39;t make you feel worse somehow. 😰) </p>

I have a horrible confession to make. 
I am that horrible friend/coworker. 😶

A lady I work with had told me she was pregnant really early on. One of those bizarre scenarios where I mentioned I'd had MCs, and she blurted it out because she was terrified she might have one and how would she know. Perfectly fine conversation, and she swore me to secrecy. No problem-o, I can keep a secret. 

This was ....3? Months ago. At least. Anyways, I was chatting with another friend, who is going through some tough times. I mentioned how coworker would be off work in a couple months, vaguely mentioned that she was pregnant. She's well into her 2nd tri, (totally thought she'd announced).... (To clarify the person I told is NOT management, and the story gets more convoluted, but the tldr, the info got passed from my friend to someone else to someone else who called coworker and was like ""wtf?"")


And the a couple hours later I get a call from coworker asking why I'd alerted management to her condition ....

Oh my god. 😨

Anyways, it's not going to be a problem, but I feel horrible. I can't believe I am that person. She and I did chat and she was a bit frustrated, but I don't think I've cause a giant work drama where we won't speak to each other.

<p>I&#39;ll just use it as an excuse I guess. If it&#39;s negative that means I can go to the bar. Bleh.</p>

I don't reddit on weekends so I miss all my balloon days but damn, halfway there. 

Midwife appt and anatomy scan tomorrow. I haven't been to the midwife since the first week of May, so I haven't had any confirmation that things are still okay in there so I'm a little nervous. I've been having some sharper cramps this week. Not anything major - they're just occasional, I've had cramps from pretty much the second sperm met egg (at least it feels that way), all different types and probably some other sharp ones too but just another thing to ramp up the anxiety. 

At least the midwife appt is before the anatomy scan so I will get the heartbeat confirmation there and then can go into the scan more confident. 

I think I *might* have felt some movement yesterday (anterior placenta) but I don't know if it was really it. I told my husband but then it started to feel more regular and I think it might have been my own heartbeat? People talk about hearing the placenta on the doppler, is that your pulse? I don't know how these things work. Can I feel my own pulse down in my abdomen? 

Had dinner with my in laws last night and they asked when we're going public and I told them never. On top of the usual PAL anxiety, there's weird stuff with my husband's estranged father but  yesterday his mom promised never to tell anyone at work (he used to work there too - recently retired) and never post anything online.

1).  OPKs.  Short for ovulation predictor kits.  You use these early in your cycle (depending on how long your cycles normally are) to see when you are ovulating.  Once you get a positive OPK, you can expect to ovulate within the next 24-36 hours.  

2).  Track your cervical fluid.  Cervical fluid that is egg white in consistency normally means ovulation is coming within the next few days.  It is possible to have egg white cervical fluid and not ovulate though (happened to me) which is why OPKs help a lot in determining this.  

3).  Take your temperature.  Buy a basal body thermometer (ONLY this kind of thermometer works) and take your temperature immediately after you wake up.  Do not move except to get the thermometer (mine is right under my pillow).  Graph this in an app like Fertility Friend or Kindara.  Before you ovulate, you'll have lowish basal body temperatures.  After you ovulate, your temp will increase.  This is only useful for determining ovulation AFTER it happened.  A positive OPK doesn't always mean you will ovulate so temping is a way to determine it actually did happen.  

I'm sure there is a lot more information out there that someone can contribute.  But this is all I've got so far.  I'm irregular so apps that determine my fertile window aren't good for me because my fertile window is never the same.  I use fertility friend and kindara (kindara is only for the pretty graph it gives me when I take my temperature).  You've had a D&C and it may take a while for your period to return (although I hope that isn't the case for you).

In the mirror I look all belly, in this video - not so much. My heart sank. And the few times I've kind of gorged and felt super full as you've described, I've wanted to die - it hurt so much. So much more than eating too much/binging non-pregnant. I've been sick for the past 3 months, nearly every day, and when I see stories of women being so sick they lost 15 lbs I'm like 😒. Like damn, if I had to be this sick i wish I could have lost and not gained. But I've just eaten protein drinks, juice, and white carbs for three months because it's all I could stomach. I did a clean eating program for 4 months prior to getting pregnant and was seeing good progress and eating pretty well. That's all gone out the window. I'm sad that I've eaten this junk and started off this child on such terrible foods. I didn't have any energy to cook or meal prep. I dunno, I'm just kind of rambling with you here. I don't have anything to offer other than I get it and I'm sorry. I hope to begin walking and light workouts again soon and to clean up my diet.

<p>I was just at my OB&#39;s yesterday but wasn&#39;t aware of that yet so haven&#39;t brought it up. Will definitely bring it up next time. In the meantime, I slept with a compression stocking last night (could only find one! lol so put it on one leg) and it does seem a little bit better... still swollen but I don&#39;t feel it as much as yesterday. Will definitely continue the compression stockings - but still I keep thinking this shouldn&#39;t have happened at 15 weeks. </p>

I love my husband and he is so ready to be a father, but I'm not ready to miscarry again and at this point I feel like before getting pregnant again I should mentally prepare myself that I could miscarry again. This first time was not so bad, but the second time was complicated and physically much more painful, why would I want to do that to myself again? Especially now, before the summer holidays. I do not want to miscarry while on vacation. Anyway, I also do not want to talke about it or fight about it with my husband, so I just kept saying everything is still irregular and watched that we wouldn't over-do it in the relevant time-frame. 

The other day he came to me to tell me that he thinks it's time we start really trying, taking temperature, getting the calendar going again, because obviously we're not conceiving as easily as before. And I told him that we can start next month.

So yesterday I got really hungry, and bloated and had some cramps. It's few days early for my period, but whatever. I'm going to a party tonight, so I was hoping things would settle so I didn't feel all bloated then. Because I know there will be drinking tonight, and because I figured I will get my period any day now anyway, I took a pregnancy test this morning. I do that every month, just to be sure. And today, there was the slightest pink line. It's faint, but it's there. And I didn't take an early test, just a normal one, and it's still a few days before I really should have taken it. 

I don't even know how to feel. I'm not ready for this yet. And I know, I should have talked to my husband about it and used protection, but it's  been 5 months and I know I ""should"" be ready. Also, I'm just so tired of discussing my body and fertility and pregnancy. Like: That's not my life. I'm more than my ability to carry a baby to term. The country I live in is very nonchalant about miscarriages, they don't do ultrasounds until week 11/12, they don't do any tests or treatments until you had at least 3 or 4 miscarriages in a row. I never felt taken seriously here. When I wanted to get a scan at 9 weeks last time, they made it sound like I was being ""complicated"" and kept telling me that this is way out of line. When they finally did it and couldn't find a heart beat, the nurse went so far as to tell me that it wouldn't have made a difference if I would have waited another 2 weeks to find out. I really, really would like to go to my home country to deal with anything pregnancy-related, but I can't. 

So now there is this faint pink line and I'm not sure what to do about it. I don't feel pregnant. I don't want to tell my husband.

My therapist has tried ALOT to help me with this, when I acknowledge it&#39;s a problem, and she does help a little. But it&#39;s still there. My husband tries too. Whenever he confronts me about my sadness and questions what the triggers are, besides our son being gone, I avoid telling him I blame myself because it will piss him off. He says it doesn&#39;t make sense, but that&#39;s always simmering in the back of my head when we talk. He says things that are logical like &quot;why bring yourself down and be depressed over something in life you had no control over?&quot; And I want to scream back, &quot;but it was my fault! It happened in my body, under my watch!&quot;</p>

<p>So that&#39;s my biggest problem. I&#39;m not sure if any amount of talking and rationalizing is going to make me stop blaming myself. I hope time will help me, but I&#39;m not sure if it will.</p>

I don't think it's unhealthy to feel any particular way about any of your losses.

<p>I have moments where I say to myself we should have started earlier. I also have moments when I am glad we waited until we did. We are so much better able to cope with miscarriage at this stage in our lives than we would have before. </p>

I'm starting, or consciously starting, to wonder if having this many miscarriages presents a problem. Not the lady parts kind of problem we think of first, but more the mental problem kind. A grieving problem, a mental coping problem. 

One, having 1 miscarriage is largely acknowledged to be a sad thing that people don't get over easily. This is both a TV trope and a real life thing. Anyone here can attest to the fact that a miscarriage is a very sad thing. I don't think there's any argument there. This shit blows!

Two, there are lots of suggested ways to deal with one's miscarriage. Plant a tree, get a tattoo, jewelry, make a donation etc etc. Great good you have a tree in the backyard that represents your loss, hopefully it brings you comfort and helps you through the tough days. 

With that in mind, what happens when we have multiple losses? Essentially we're saying that a single loss is a big deal (yup). So assuredly two losses is also a big deal. And three is a bigger deal. (The only question seems to be is this a logarithmic increase, an exponential or simply additional? But I digress, that's math stuff! Though I'd happily read through any math thoughts you all have lol)

When does it stop being comforting to plant trees that represent your miscarriages? There must be a point, either you run out of yard space or you now have a bloody forest around your house. What if you don't even like trees?! 

In context to me... I'm wondering if because I'm now at the 3 count, I'm starting to discount or ignore my own grief or upset. I'm starting to feel like the CP I had the very first cycle (which did cause me a lot of sad emotion) doesn't even count any more. It just seems like such a nothing, compared to the heart break and upset that came later. Is that healthy? Is this a safe coping strategy?  (Shrug, it doesn't seem that bad from where I'm sitting right now, but it sure seemed bad then, and I wouldn't discount anyone's perception of their CP - bad or okay)

I've been lurking here since my second (CP/early) loss in February... but since i just had my third (last week... while on vacation, natch), I figured I would introduce myself.

Mr. IHeart and I have been trying for ~14 months now (including 4 cycles on letrozole). We've been through a boatload of tests, and I've had positive HPTs three times, but they all failed at exactly 4+6. This last one was the most physically painful of the three, and really drove home the fact that even an early loss is a loss (even if my RE thinks it's no big deal). :\  I'm grateful that each one ""resolved"" without needing further medical intervention, but I'm getting kinda tired of this game. Our next step is IVF in August, so we can do PGS on any embryos we get, since at this point my RE thinks ""quality"" is the most likely culprit.

I know many folks here experienced later loss, so there is much that I cannot relate to, and my heart goes out to you all. But I'm hoping to find some others with repeat early losses to commiserate with a bit. I'm pretty active on the stilltrying sub, but I'd like to find some folks who understand why I feel like getting excited about a positive HPT is just a setup for disappointment. Sigh.

Our next step is IVF in August, so we can do PGS on any embryos we get, since at this point my RE thinks &quot;quality&quot; is the most likely culprit.</p>

<p>I know many folks here experienced later loss, so there is much that I cannot relate to, and my heart goes out to you all. But I&#39;m hoping to find some others with repeat early losses to commiserate with a bit. I&#39;m pretty active on the stilltrying sub, but I&#39;d like to find some folks who understand why I feel like getting excited about a positive HPT is just a setup for disappointment. Sigh.</p>

<p>Much love to all of you! &lt;3</p>

So here we are, two years later. I have so many conflicting emotions:

- Thankful: for my husband and his support. We walked through some darker days after the miscarriage but he was my rock. I couldn't ask for a better partner.
- Sad: I should be celebrating my kid's first birthday this month. Instead, I'm reflecting on what could have been.
- Grateful: I know I *should* have a lot of things, including my baby, but life isn't perfect and I'm okay with where things are now. We don't always get what we deserve, even when we've done nothing wrong. I acknowledge this and am grateful for all that I have, whether I deserved it or not.
- Happy: is it okay to be happy, even though one feels sad at the same time? Either way, that is an emotion I feel frequently and I'm so glad to hang onto it every second that I can.
- Mad: why can't life just be easier? Why do we have to fight so hard, yet still lose out?
- Hopeful: this is where I try to stay. I am hopeful that I will be a mother, and my husband a father. I am hopeful that it'll only get better from here. I am hopeful that, whether it goes according to plan or not, I will enjoy life and be fulfilled. I am hopeful. Hope is the only thing that keeps me pushing ahead, despite my conflicting emotions.

I am so grateful for this wonderful community. I am sorry that I've had to be here for a while, many of you probably don't recognize or remember me, but you all have helped me through so much.

<p>So here we are, two years later. I have so many conflicting emotions:</p>

<ul>
<li>Thankful: for my husband and his support. We walked through some darker days after the miscarriage but he was my rock. I couldn&#39;t ask for a better partner.</li>
<li>Sad: I should be celebrating my kid&#39;s first birthday this month. Instead, I&#39;m reflecting on what could have been.</li>
<li>Grateful: I know I <em>should</em> have a lot of things, including my baby, but life isn&#39;t perfect and I&#39;m okay with where things are now. We don&#39;t always get what we deserve, even when we&#39;ve done nothing wrong. I acknowledge this and am grateful for all that I have, whether I deserved it or not.</li>
<li>Happy: is it okay to be happy, even though one feels sad at the same time? Either way, that is an emotion I feel frequently and I&#39;m so glad to hang onto it every second that I can.</li>
<li>Mad: why can&#39;t life just be easier? Why do we have to fight so hard, yet still lose out?</li>
<li>Hopeful: this is where I try to stay. I am hopeful that I will be a mother, and my husband a father. I am hopeful that it&#39;ll only get better from here. I am hopeful that, whether it goes according to plan or not, I will enjoy life and be fulfilled. I am hopeful. Hope is the only thing that keeps me pushing ahead, despite my conflicting emotions.</li>
</ul>

<p>I am so grateful for this wonderful community. I am sorry that I&#39;ve had to be here for a while, many of you probably don&#39;t recognize or remember me, but you all have helped me through so much. Thank you. </p>

I only have had 2 HCG tests through this whole experience - the original POAS when I was 4w1d and again 4w2d. Next Monday marks 28 days since I started to miscarry naturally and Tuesday marks 28 days from my D&C. 

DH and I had unprotected sex 2 weeks after the D&C, which was 2 days before some egg white CF appeared, so there is a non-zero chance that I am pregnant again. However, I know that the ""cycle"" immediately following a miscarriage can be long and weird. 

If I do not get my period next week and get a positive from a POAS, does anyone here know how to interpret that? I know that I could have residual HCG from the pregnancy, but I haven't been tracking that at all. Would it help to do a POAS now when a positive test likely only could mean residual HCG? Alternatively, does the fertile CF mean that I probably ovulated? Does ovulating even require HCG levels to disappear to a level that POAS would not detect? 

I feel so naive right now! Help me ladies (and gents).

[Edit: My OB also told me to wait 2 weeks to have sex and 3 weeks to see her for a follow-up. At the 3 week follow up, she told me not to have unprotected sex until next cycle.

I pumped breastmilk for roughly the first three weeks after the loss of our son. I'm getting ready to donate it to the local milk bank, which I'm excited about.

My daughter was conceived via IVF/ICSI. I couldn't do a fresh transfer because of OHSS. Our first FET was successful and we were so excited. I had a perfect check up at 28 weeks and everything was going well. I had an anterior placenta which made it difficult to feel movement. I noticed she wasn't moving as much and decided to go in. There was no heartbeat. This happened back in January. Our lives were forever changed from that moment. 

I tested negative for clotting disorders and infection. My placenta and umbilical cord results were normal. She was healthy and they couldn't find any problems. The autopsy suggested a cord accident was a possibility but there was no evidence. They didn't find any knots in my cord, etc. They believe her supply was cut off but they can't prove what exactly caused it. An acute hypoxic event without clear etiology. 

We have more embryos in storage. The doctors assure us that there will be more monitoring next time. We want to try again...but the fear can be intense and our grief complicates things. We're terrified this will happen again. I'm meeting with my RE soon to discuss our next steps. We're not ready yet but we want to move forward soon.

I got chills at your story of your daughter because it is close to identical to the story of my daughter.  
Our girl, Marin Elizabeth, was born on 8/12/15 at 24 weeks and 3 days.  She spent the next 13 days in the NICU and then we made the choice to withdraw care.  
We chose to wait just under 6 months before actually trying again and actually had a TAC placed as I have cervical incompetence and it was the best option for our family.  We have just done our second FET with ICSI and did 2 failed IUIs prior to that.  I have my first blood test on Saturday.  

So we are almost 2 years from the time of our daughter's birth and things will start to feel different. I still wish that this wasn't our life. I long for a baby to bring home too and not just one that didn't get to live her life with her parents.  Things have been so very difficult in both the first year and this year following Marin's death.  It's a hard path to navigate.  My best advice to you is don't deny your feelings, do what you feel is the most important for your family and your daughter's life and memory and take care of all of your needs emotionally through self care as best as you can. It was important for me to remember that my husband and I are on the same team. 
We have also struggled with what other people think or have thought and the when will I feel better about this as well.  
Feel free to PM me if you ever want to chat. I have a couple of friends who have experienced similar stories to ours and they have been lifesavers for me in the past couple of years. 
I'm not really active on this thread as much, I check in sometimes but I'm mostly over on infertility since we have been doing all that stuff for a while now too.

[Possible TW as the post meanders into a discussion of abort!on.]

This weekend, I traveled to NYC for my husband's cousin's bar mitzvah. On Friday night, I had earth [shatteringly amazing sushi](http://sushinakazawa.com) in West Village in NYC, which I would not have been able to do if I were still pregnant. I enjoyed every last bite of it. 

The bar mitzvah on Saturday was led by a *very* reform cantor who used two teeny guitars that he had tuned like ukuleles. Imagine big man playing a small guitar so vigorously that he broke a string. He asked people in attendance to share what they were thankful for, and I literally burst into tears when someone said ""my children."" Thankfully, I was sitting at the very end of the front row, so only my husband and the cantor saw me crying, and they both played it cool. I keep thinking that I am doing well emotionally, and then find myself crying on a dime. 

This morning, I had my post-op appointment for the D&C. My OB was really late, and I felt my panic rising as I missed more and more work and was surrounded by happy pregnant mamas and endless little ones. Once I finally saw the OB, she told me not to try to conceive until I get at least one period. Post-opp instructions had said no sex until last week, so I had to sheepishly admit to her that there was a non-zero chance that I already had conceived. Further adding to my discomfort, we had this very awkward conversation about genetic testing and abort!on. Apparently, her patients wait until they are pregnant to get genetic testing, because that's what insurance usually covers. If we had genetic testing before conceiving and found that we both were carriers of something, she would recommend donor sperm. I am pretty sure that this was because of cost again. When I asked her what her patients do if an abnormality is found, she responded by telling me that they carry it to term. This made me want to run back up north where there are an abundance of academic medical centers and more liberal attitudes. The thought of donor sperm is *horrifying* to me right now, and I am pretty uncomfortable with the idea of conceiving without knowing risk (even though I have done that once already). I felt so ashamed telling her that there are situations in which I would abort and even worse telling her that *after* I already got pregnant once and had unprotected sex earlier this month. I am a 30 year old married woman, and I felt ashamed for having sex with my husband. That's crazy. 

After that appointment, my husband and I went to the only deli in the area that has reasonably good bagels, where we both enjoyed everything bagels with lox - something else I couldn't touch if I were pregnant.

Life is confusing. I am exhausted. I'm not even sure what I want right now.

We have a son already and I just love him to death, but we have always wanted a girl, and I really really thought this one was a girl based on symptoms and all the gender woo. 

This will be the fifth grand kid on one side and the fourth on the other, and all the others are boys as well. This will probably be the last grandkid for both and everybody was banking on a girl. 🙄

And I know it's all stupid, and I know I'm going to love this little boy when I meet him, just like I love my son beyond words, but man. 

I just feel I like it so much harder with a boy dealing with gender norms. We are not a football, rough housing type family but my husband's family very much is. It has been such a struggle not to let them indoctrinate our son with all the ""boys will be boys"" crap while we try to raise a good person. I'm disappointed we have to go through all this again.

I'm taking:

- Prenatal with iron
- Methylfolate
- Vitamin B complex
- Vitamin C
- Vitamin D3
- Vitamin E
- Zinc
- CoQ10
- Fish Oil
- Probiotic
- Decaf green tea (separate from the folate, in the arvo)

After O I can't help but do the pineapple core and Brazil nuts thing (since they are easy and yummy).

I recognise most of these aren't evidence based, but I basically copied the regime of a friend of mine who went through an RE for IUI with great success (twice), so I feel comfortable with them. I will stop all except the prenatal if/when I get my BFP.

Also considering the myoinositol now!

Also, weekly yoga, walking a lot, sleeping well, no caffeine or alcohol (except one or two red wines during AF).

<p>Re: mental health, there&#39;s also acupuncture. I almost think of it like a form of meditation. It was really nice to have someone who could speak &#39;fertility&#39; and be there with me during the ups and downs of my cycles. </p>

TW: Talk of living baby who later died. 

I thought I was done running into people who don't know what happened, but at work tonight one of my long time customers came in. She excitedly ran over and said ""oh yay! You're back! I have to see baby photos!""

I should have photos of a four month old, but I don't. I have a small collection of photos from when Rhona was home with us, and of course I love the opportunity to show them, but it doesn't mean that I wasn't tearing up almost immediately. It's such a hard conversation to have. 

""Thank you for asking, I had a perfect baby girl in January, well, it turns out she wasn't so perfect, so she died, but please look at these living photos of my now dead baby with me so that I can validate myself as a mother."" Woof. 

And then back to work, like nothing happened. 

Later a new coworker got me mixed up with the coworker who was pregnant at the same time as me and asked when I was scheduled to use the office to pump. That's the second time that has happened and it's a crushing blow. We should have to be figuring out how to schedule us both to pump, and have comedy gold trying to keep our bottles separate in the fridge. Instead I just mumble stuff and try not to be the person who has to cover her section. 

I miss my daughter so fucking much.

Also, I am told to go to have my uterus checked before trying again each time after an MC, because there may be scar tissue that has to be removed.

It is no longer common practice to make women wait to have 3 miscarriages to be treated for recurrent pregnancy loss. In fact, to me, that is barbaric.

This raised my hackles because in my hyper sensitive state it sounds (to me) like the billboard is claiming I've been ""choosing"" something else. 

So I sent an email, basically saying that I have often wondered if groups like that can exist without hurting and harming the very women and couples they are talking about. And that with this billboard and my history, I can conclusively state the answer is no. And that I can state firmly that their billboard doesn't change my mind about any choice a woman might make. If anything, their words and my experience lead me to believe they are clueless about the effort, time, and stress that can go towards trying to have a healthy pregnancy. 



Anyways, I got a reply back today and it makes me want to roll my eyes so hard. Basically the person is like ""no, you are totally misreading put big stupid billboard. But we're so glad you agree that life begins at conception! (Whaaaaaaat? Bitch that is so not what I emailed you!) And then she offered to offer me help if I ever wanted to talk about my losses. Uh huh. Wonder if she'd still be keen to offer if I'd needed a d+c or had an ectopic that required methotrexate.... 🙄

I didn't get compression stockings, but I did get a gown with a hot air hose ( I ended up unplugging that... turns out I don't like being inflated). My husband was with me until they gave me the medicine to sedate me. I remember him kissing me goodbye and being wheeled into the OR. The doctors and nurses in the OR were laughing because I had on a baseball cap that no one ever made me take off. They joked that I could just put my party hat (hair net) right on over it. They were asking about where the brewery was on my hat and that's all I remember. (I can only imagine the directions I gave).

I woke up with a nurse talking to me in the recovery room. She told me it was over and I had done great. I'd been crying off and on all day and the finality of it being ""over"" set me off again. She was very sweet and offered me ice chips and tissues. 

When I woke up my throat was a little sore, I was having a little bit of cramping, my vagina was sore and (for whatever reason) my rectum was sore, too. I also had to pee, but opted to wait until I was out of recovery so that I didn't have to use a bed pan. They gave me a Tylenol for pain. 

After a few minutes, they took me into a private room where my husband joined me. They measured vitals a few times and had me stay for an hour and a half. I had some crackers, soda, and peed probably 800 times. After that they let me get dressed and wheeled me out to our car.

The cramps wore off quickly, but the pain in my vagina and rectum stuck around and still seem to be pretty stubborn. I asked for some pain medicine to help and they were happy to prescribe some. It has helped.

I also think for me it&#39;s sometimes about feeling the needle &quot;zing&quot; at first and then relaxing into not feeling it that brings some sort of calm for me. I&#39;ve had some of my most positive visualizations during the time I&#39;m left to &quot;marinate&quot; with the needles in - one of my favorites that came to me was a vision that came to me of my husband playing in the surf of an ocean with our &quot;future&quot; child. It&#39;s a vision I return to sometimes when I feel like i need to be positive about the future and not doubt myself or say &quot;maybe it will happen.&quot; </p>

Any m/c based on my RBT is likely to be between weeks 5-9, and any issues would be tested for at week 11. Telling people &quot;never mind&quot; after a pregnancy announcement is the worst.</p>

Deep breaths. I live in an area with a similar daycare dynamic, and the struggle is real. What happens at these daycares is siblings of enrolled kids get priority for the infant rooms, and only if there's leftover spots after all the siblings are in, does a 'new' family get to enroll. Sometimes siblings take up ALL the spots. I don't think realistically any women sign up before they're pregnant, but maybe there are crazies that do...

With our first, what I ended up doing is just putting an ideal date on the form (3 months after the due date I believe) and we ended up paying out the nose to hire a nanny to care for him until we got in.

For the past few months, husband and I have been scoping out the rental landscape and looking at prospective 2BR apartments to move into after our current lease is over.  We currently live in a 1BR and out of sheer stubbornness, we would like to stay in the same neighborhood even though there are plenty of less pricey options if we move further away from the city center.  So far we're reached out to brokers about 5 apartments.

* The 1st one didn't have much by way of storage space, the kitchen was sized for ants, and overall it felt like a lateral move (or even a downgrade!) even though we'd be paying $700 more per month.  The pros were that it's on a quiet street and there are laundry facilities in the (kinda creepy) basement.
* The 2nd and 3rd apartments are in the same building, but were rented out within a week of being listed before we were able to schedule a viewing.  I was hopeful about these apartments as they were spacious with lots of natural light.  The only thing I didn't like about them was that there were no laundry facilities in the building but neither does our current apartment.  I told a coworker about them and she was super excited for me; she even had a dream that we'd get one of the the apartment and was more devastated than we were when I told her it didn't work out.  She then said it's okay, husband and I just didn't have any *[yuanfen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yuanfen)* with those apartments (lol), and we'll hopefully find something better and with laundry.
* The 4th apartment I found 3 days before we were to return from an overseas trip.  I sent a message to the broker to schedule a viewing after our return but it was rented out the next day.
* For the fifth apartment, I just received confirmation for a viewing set for tomorrow evening.  It is pretty much perfect in terms of location, kitchen size and arrangement, having in-unit laundry, and the potential for garden access so I can have a vegetable garden again.  Unfortunately the availability date is cutting it very close to when our current lease ends and we'd be taking over the remainder of the current lease as the tenants will be closing on a house in a few weeks.  This of course raises some potential issues like, what if the current tenants either don't close on-time or just can't close.  I presume contingencies would be outlined in the contract we sign (and if not, we should insist that they are), but that's something we'll need to look out for so we don't suddenly find ourselves scrambling to rent any apartment just so we don't end up homeless with a pile of boxes.

Anyway, I'm feeling very excited about this and hope it pans out for us and the current tenants.  The back-up plan is that we just stay in our current apartment for another year.  While baby making hasn't been working out as husband and I had hoped with a series of CPs since February, we're looking at the silver linings: at least I won't be crazy pregnant while we're moving our shit out of a 4th-floor walk-up.",[],,t1_dibfl3g,False,0,[],False,"<div class=""md""><p>Heads up: This is a long completely off-topic post.</p>

Finally back to therapy today and I'm really looking forward to it. It's been a month. I had to cancel 4 weeks ago and then my therapist had to cancel 3 weeks ago and then I was on vacation, so this appointment is long overdue. 

Lots of things to talk about. Like how my MIL pissed me off so bad via text during our vacation that I don't even want to let her come to the hospital anymore (I'm probably overreacting, I may change my mind).

I flipped out. 

1. They are NOT hot. Some are, but the ones I went in were not.
2. Don't you think I would have done my own research/talked to my own doctors about this? 
3. What if I had already spent 30 minutes in a hot tub, now all you're doing is increasing my anxiety that I killed my baby.
4. Butt the fuck out.

I KNOW I am partly overreacting but it made me so mad. This is basically the first instance of this unsolicited advice and I KNOW it will get worse.

Pretty much 99.9% of the time, if someones HCG is under 1,000 (even that is pushing it) nothing will be seen on an ultrasound. If you had an ectopic, the ultrasound would not have picked it up until your levels were higher and even then it can be difficult. The ""gestational sac"" could have been an endometrial cyst, or it could have been fluid in the endo canal, or it could have been a 'pseudocyst' which happens with ectopics.
at my facility when we have instances like yours, we usually have the patient follow up with an ultrasound/labs in a few days to see if there is a viable pregnancy. unfortunately, since your labs were not rising steadily that wouldn't have been the case. The reason i'm writing this is because I don't want you to feel like because you didn't have ""ultrasound proof"" that maybe you made the wrong decision or that your doctor made the wrong decision.

I could smell literally everything and I was also a smoker...so I was like <em>really</em> smelling all the smells. Lol. I keep thinking this is happening again. Or maybe I&#39;m just crazy...hahaha.</p>

<p>Also, I keep figuring out &quot;possible&quot; due dates. And then figuring out what the date would be if I was induced at 37 weeks like my MFM told me. So, if I&#39;m out this cycle, but next one works....ill have a baby on my birthday! That would be cool.... Oh, this wishful thinking might break me if it doesn&#39;t work that way. Oh well.</p>

Two, is that you probably will see a nurse before the doctor. I would share your concerns with the nurse and ask her to alert the doctor.

I've been following your updates, and this result is so very heartbreaking. Sending you lots of hugs and healing thoughts. 

I will say, I think the chinese herbal medicine is kind of a red flag. I had a very honest chat with my RE, who is highly competent and very caring, and she said she totally supports acupuncture for stress and anxiety during infertility but if attempts are made to sell you thousands of dollars in herbal medicines, it's time to walk away. My worry is that women dealing with multiple losses and infertility are a vulnerable population - we hit a point where we are so desperate to find a solution, that we are more likely to try things that are not really supported by evidence. That is not inherently bad, but when someone else is making thousands of dollars off of it, it raises my suspicions.

Otherwise, regarding next steps, I'd consider two things in your position. First, I would get a second opinion on your history and past protocols from a different RE at a different practice.

Sending you lots of hugs and healing thoughts. </p>

<p>I will say, I think the chinese herbal medicine is kind of a red flag. I had a very honest chat with my RE, who is highly competent and very caring, and she said she totally supports acupuncture for stress and anxiety during infertility but if attempts are made to sell you thousands of dollars in herbal medicines, it&#39;s time to walk away. My worry is that women dealing with multiple losses and infertility are a vulnerable population - we hit a point where we are so desperate to find a solution, that we are more likely to try things that are not really supported by evidence. That is not inherently bad, but when someone else is making thousands of dollars off of it, it raises my suspicions.</p>

<p>Otherwise, regarding next steps, I&#39;d consider two things in your position. First, I would get a second opinion on your history and past protocols from a different RE at a different practice. I&#39;d aim for one at a nationally reputable clinic, which may mean phone conversation rather than in person.

My wife and I are in a similar boat -- 6 losses, no answers, everything normal. Still waiting on the genetic results of this last loss (it's the first one we've had tested). 

As to where to go next... since you do have APS, have you looked into other auto-immune issues? Lupus, Rheumatoid Arthritis, and Sjorgens come to mind. I ask because if they're flaring up, you could ask the doctors for steroids to see if they'd calm down.

You could also just try prednisone anyway. [One study](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3524288/) indicates that a combination of lovenox, aspirin, prednisone, and IVIg treatments result in much better outcomes for those with APS.

I've recently been through a similar thing, and while everyone has a different experience, I can share my perspective and hope that it will be useful.

I had spotting starting at 5 weeks, which turned to bleeding with cramping around 5+6. At that point I went to the ER and my HCG was at 1700, but ultrasound showed nothing except an ""echogenic focus of 1.3 mm, potentially a gestational sac"". 2 days later I went back for increased bleeding and pain, HCG was at 1400, and they said it was a miscarriage. One week later HCG went up to 1800, ultrasound still didn't see anything anywhere, and they called it ectopic and gave me methotrexate.

I asked the same as you - how can it be ectopic if they can't see it on an ultrasound? - and apparently it's more common than you might think. Also, if it was an incomplete miscarriage and not an ectopic, the methotrexate should take care of that as well.

In the week before the shot my bleeding had started to slow, then stopped for a few days. A few days after the shot I was feeling like you are now - tired, a little nauseous, a bit crampy. I went back to work after two days off and kept waiting for a blood bath that never happened. I would say that my pain and bleeding were worse pre-shot than after. Depending where you are going out of town, it should be okay - I wouldn't go off grid on a backpacking trip, but I would go to another town with medical facilities nearby.

Over the past month I've felt generally pretty tired, with cramping/bloating and random bits of period-like flow with spotting in between, but nothing worse than a usual CD1. I just heard that my HCG yesterday was at 29, and that I'll likely be two more weeks to hit zero (it's been dropping by about 60-70% each week, which was awesome when it was over 1000 but has slowed down considerably). Your doctor should follow you all the way down to zero to make sure all is well.

I hope you start to feel better soon. The unpredictability of all this might be the worst part.",[],,t1_di8sboy,False,0,[],False,"<div class=""md""><p>I&#39;m sorry for your loss and all the confusion.</p>

It seems like so long and so little time still. I will say that time has slowed considerably. I have four weeks of work left and I want to kill everybody.

I feel like I have mastered the art of telling someone they are stupid in a nice way. Although yesterday I did actually tell someone they need to chill to their face. He looked at me like I slapped him and calmed down. He was very appreciative after that.

Other than that, I'm trying to walk and exercise where I can - I've given up on lifting at the gym. Planning to get back into it after baby is born. I've gained about 30 lbs, which means I'm trending about the same that I gained with my son (I gained 40) - for a long time I was upset about it and now I'm just trying to stay positive and remember how quickly it came off last time.  Walking a ton helps with hip/pelvic pain. Some foot swelling on hot days, but nothing major. My rings still fit which is good! Lots of heartburn, sleeping is a bitch but nothing else to really complain about! 

Baby girl is crazy active (thank goodness) and has reached the point where she is just rolling and stretching. I swear I saw a foot stick out there the other day, it was super weird. I love watching my belly just move and jiggle on it's own.

No one should be made to feel they are unworthy or ""bad mother"" material - it's hard enough to wonder that stuff about ourselves sometime, let alone an intimate partner. 

One thing to keep in mind: It's good you're saving up, but I'd urge you to consider it an ""infertility fund/visit to a Reproductive Endocrinologist (RE) fund"" more broadly over a specific ""tubal ligation reversal fund."" Some research has shown that since tubal ligations can be tricky and not always work to create clear, functioning tubes (for example, if you tend to scar internally easily, something none of us really know about until they suspect it on a test called an HSG or confirm it with a surgery called laparoscopy). 

But the good news is that IVF was first used on women with ""tubal factor"" infertility so women who need to ""bypass"" their tubes and otherwise have good fertility prospects will sometimes opt to go straight to IVF rather than have a reversal surgery, learn it created scarring/didn't really work, and then have to go on to IVF anyway. But there's no way I or you can know which you are more likely a candidate for. It may even be worth saving up for a consultation with an RE and some initial tests in the short term, so that you know where you stand and whether surgery or IVF would be recommended for you in the long term. 

I don't mean to put any scare in you and I don't have the stats on how successful the reversals are and what factors play into that success - I would just explore these questions with a RE rather than working with say an ob/gyn who might not be as knowledgable about all aspects of fertility.

I got baby clothes all week in the mail after the D&amp;C. Fetal monitor also arrived after it was too late. I never opened that. I had to pack the clothes away because DF kept looking at them and bursting into tears over her little socks and hat. That was a few weeks ago. Now we are getting back into baby mode. I still have the urge to buy clothes and baby stuff. I can&#39;t really stop it, although I haven&#39;t bought anything new yet. I feel like now that I&#39;ve been pregnant, by body is on a mission to get there again ASAP. But, I did save a pair of booties. When I do get my BFP, I&#39;m going to surprise DF with them in some way that he doesn&#39;t expect. We found out at the same time with our last BFP. I want to plan a nice surprise this time around. (A little hopeful for a perfect Father&#39;s Day...)</p>

And as for water safety- I'm a bit biased because I'm an instructor now of infant self-rescue lessons. 

If you're living in a place, or often visit a place that has oceans or lakes or pools everywhere, I highly recommend ISR lessons. You can check out www.infantswim.com and see if there's an instructor near you. We teach infants and toddlers to hold their breath, roll to their back, and float until help arrives. Older kids are taught to swim to safety as well. At the end we test them in their clothes since most drownings don't happen when a kid is intending to swim. 

It's time intensive but in my opinion totally worth it. They can be pretty expensive (although not really compared to years of ""regular"" lessons) but there are foundations that do scholarships. My favorite is Live Like Jake (a family who lost their little boy Jake to drowning and started a ISR scholarship foundation). 

Aside from lessons like that, my general advice would be to never use floaties. The kids become used to floating and breathing in a feet-down position, so if they ever fall in, their muscle memory will divert to that position and they go straight to the bottom. Not to mention the false sense of security. They learn to love the water and want to be in it, and think they're invincible. Of the ten drownings in Florida in the past few week, I want to say something like 7 of those kids had prior use of floaties. So no floaties is my biggest thing. If you're using it ""for their safety"" then you shouldn't be at the pool. Pool time is eyes-on time, all the time.  

The other thing I like to tell people is to teach your kid how the water works in that, if they jump in, they go under. A lot of parents catch their kids and sort of lift them out or just dip their feet in. Nope, let them jump in and sink and get water in their eyes and nose, every dang time. (Then catch them under water.)  although even this is risky because they start to learn somebody will always rescue them. No goggles for toddlers, that's silly. No nose plugs. They need to respect the water. Once they're skilled they can have all that. 

Also, layers of protection if you have a pool- eyes on your kid obviously (but kids are sneaky), a locking, self-closing gate around the pool (with no chairs or table around the outside of it), a cover on the pool, an alarm on the pool, and self-rescue lessons in case they ever do get into the pool by themselves. 

[this is my son showing off](https://youtu.be/mPU6LJAXnrc)after his lessons. last summer. (Go to like 25 seconds to skip all his waffling about getting in, lol).

And [this is a video](https://youtu.be/rKvpPeha2sw) that goes viral almost every summer, that shows it better and explains it as well. 

And, again, sorry for the long post. This is what happens when asked about water safety, lol. It's just that drowning is the number two cause of death in children under age four, and it is SO preventable.

----

I'm 6DPO and definitely pulling some symptom spotting crap, but my husband and I had a productive talk about it this morning - trying to recognize the ""optimism"" of the practice without setting ourselves up too much for disappointment when it turns to be another empty cycle. 

Meanwhile, he rarely gets sick and is fighting a bad cold coming on, so I'm trying to make sure he is comfortable. We both had long, tough weeks of work so I think his body is just doing that thing where it's saying ""I can quit now, right?""

I feel bad that he's sick right now, because I had been feeling overwhelmed with house stuff and we had to talk some of that through the last couple days. We're pretty compatible in so many ways, but when times are stressful, my stress amplifies if clutter is around me or if I start feeling like the ""Sisyphus"" of the house always washing dishes and cleaning the kitchen counter only to discover it completely jacked by the next night. Meanwhile, when he's stressed out his focus narrows to a sort of ""grit through it and survive mode"" where if we need to eat dinner, then he just washes the three things we need to cook with/eat from, etc. At least we sort of found a way to meet in the middle - I was able to say ""hey I need these 3 spaces in the house to be attended to and cleaned by us each day for me not to lose it - I don't need the house to be perfect"" and I think that helped him understand how he can help me with my stress in a reasonable way and that I wasn't expecting us to turn into Martha Stewarts 24/7 or anything like that. 

Finally, I don't want to keep stirring a pot that may very well have been cleaned and put away already, but I just wanted to say I'm sorry that /u/mermaidfart08 got shut down yesterday about expressing where she was at/what she was feeling that day. This is our space - since last October, some of us have even called it our ""rat sewer"" because we know that a lot of what we express on here doesn't really have a place in the ""light of day,"" whether due to a lack of acknowledgment or just knowing that the emotions we go through aren't validated/could be considered petty/resentful ""irl"" and even online with the dominant metaphor of the ""rainbow baby"" we're all supposed to wait for to ""heal."" 

This space means a lot to me in large part because I know that I can type the things out in my head that I know most people in my life would find really negative and ranty and sometimes even petty. By getting them out here - I feel like it gives me some distance from those thoughts and it helps me know which ones are worth pursuing ""irl"" and which ones I can leave down here in the sewer (for example, is my disappointment with x family member worth expressing to them or was it enough for me to have folks here just get it? things like that).

More detail than you may want but here:

I went in for pre-op the day prior like others here. Got some blood tests (type and making sure I didn't have an infection, I think). Was asked a bunch of questions about my health history and a few about my state of mind (they probed a little about depression/suicidal thoughts). I had to sign a form saying that I ""the parent"" did not want the remains.

The next day I went in for the D&C in the morning, 2 hours before my scheduled surgery time. I wasn't allowed to eat or drink anything.

I waited around for a while with my husband in the room and some nurses said some awkward things like ""this WILL happen again...well not THIS...uh...""

We ended up doing the procedure a little early. I can't remember the exact order of events but they put some things on my legs that inflated/deflated to keep the blood flowing, gave me some valium, walked my husband out, then wheeled me into the operating room. We did the ""count backwards..."" thing and the next thing I knew I was in the recovery room with a nurse and we were talking. We talked for a long time, he got me a sprite, gave me some candy, and then they finally moved me to another room where my husband was allowed to see me. I think from me being out to finally getting to see my husband again was about an hour and a half, but I gather a lot of that was waking up and not the procedure itself.

After a little while the nurse came by to check on us and asked how I was feeling, and then she gave me permission to get up and get dressed. I hadn't bled on the pad they put under me but I did start bleeding when I got up, randomly on the floor.

I would recommend bringing your own pad if you can -- the ones they give you are almost always terrible. The one they offered me was like 12"" long and had no adhesive.

The night before my d&c when I already knew my baby was gone I started to have the miscarriage but I didn't pass everything. Honestly.... even though I knew it was happening and I had pain pills it was a bit scary for me and worse than labour pains from what I remember. 

My d&c was.....ok.  I was an emotional wreck. The biggest con was that they did it in the labour and delivery ward so before my surgery I was surrounded with the sounds of newborns but they had me in my own room and kept me away from things as much as possible.

The labour and delivery nurses were amazing. They held my hand and gave me lots of comfort. You could tell they cared.

I wasn't prepared for some of the things they asked me. If I wanted to keep the baby to bury...(at six weeks it's not required)..if I wanted to come to a yearly memorial. I said no to both. They will do testing on everything once it's removed to check for anything that might cause issues with conceiving in the future.

Then the wonderful anesthesiologist came and started my IV. He gave me some stuff to help me relax. Then they wheeled me to the operating room where they put me out. Apparently the procedure takes only about five minutes.

After I woke up they gave me juice and toast. I had to pee before I could be discharged. When I got up to use the restroom I bled all over the floor but all was fine. I don't have issues with anesthesia so that helped too.

I took a couple days to recover at home but I wasn't overly sore. Just a touch achy. Less than a period. Emotional recovery took a bit longer.....partially I'm sure do to the crazy hormone fluctuations. I bled lightly for a bit less than two weeks....it was mostly spotting really.

We were told to wait one cycle to try again. My period came back 28 days after my d&c.

I just wrote you a short novel but I hope it helps. If there's anything else you want to know just ask. I don't mind sharing and it helps to talk about it.

I know I'm still young but I was hoping I would be pregnant this cycle and conceive a rainbow by the time I turn 29 which is in February. I thought I would have all my babies before I'm 30, and my husband is now 37 so time is less on his side than mine. It's not a big deal because we're still young but I had a full term baby I was expecting to have in my arms before my 28th birthday, and he died, so it really messed up my timeline. Now that TTC is taking longer than expected it makes me feel like there is something seriously wrong with me--even though I know to some extent there isn't.

The rest of the day, I felt sadness for Riyad, I went to some events for work and a dinner, this old nosy lady I saw asked me if I ""had my baby,"" and I was at a loss for words so I just said ""no,"" because I don't know her and all the old women in my city gossip. She asked if my sister did and I said no again and she just smiled and said it's ok to take your time. Bitch. This made me cry in my car before I went to a work event. My family is very well known where I'm from, we have a large family business that employs a lot of people in the community so mostly everyone knew when Riyad died and the people who didn't, knew I was pregnant. It's very annoying since my husband and I like to be as private and low key about everything as possible, because people here just like to talk.

Anyway, I went to a work event at my business and did an awesome job, felt very proud and happy, my husband was there, and of course someone asked if we have any kids yet but we said not yet, we're planning on it though. The rest of the event was great and he told me how he loved how strong of a businesswoman I am and how I handle myself in front of others. So later on I really bonded with my husband and felt nothing but love for him and oddly love for life, while still thinking about and missing Riyad. And still frustrated about my situation. 

I feel insane. Happiness, pain, sadness, depression, bitterness, anger, joy, love...all in 24 hours. If this is my new normal I do hope it starts to settle down over time and I just experience happiness and sadness. I'll take that.

This is an afterthought but I've been looking at Riyads picture and going through his things ALOT more than before and I found it really helps me. I feel pain and sadness but after that subsides, there's a calm feeling, much better than any numbness or depression. I feel ashamed I don't acknowledge him in public to strangers but I don't want everyone to just know my story unless they become a friend. Hopefully when I have my rainbow (whenever that is), I can tell people I have one baby on earth and one in heaven.

I was actually thinking of making a blog...so I could let some people know about Riyad. I tried blogging when my grief was raw and it hurt more than helped.

I got a lot of useful information that I would like to share with this group. Long post ahead. TL;DR;  BO are just plain bad luck, even if it is two consecutive ones. We plan on doing the basic CD3 tests for ovarian reserves and thyroid test. Doctor recommends to keep trying. 

I am not a medical doctor, I am recollecting whatever my doctor said so there may be misinterpretations or mistakes. Long post ahead is mostly from the perspective of blighted ovum/anembryonic pregnancy.  
Both my MCs we BO. The doctor said they are just bad luck. When the egg is released it divides, one division gets dissolved, the other one becomes the is the egg that can be fertilized. Sometimes there is no chromosomal material in the egg which results in BO.. there may be a yolk sac but no fetal pole can be formed. I had read that sometimes the fetus is formed but gets reabsorbed during a MC. How can we be sure there was no fetal pole before the first ultrasound? Doc said, if there was a fetal pole, you will see remnants of it even in a late ultrasound. If there was no fetal pole at all, then it is definitely a case of bad luck. 
Basically the sperm made it to the party, but the star(chromosomes from egg) of the show skipped out. Everybody waited for the star to show, but there was no show. 

I really appreciated that doc did not dismiss temping, she looked at my charts and said I had good temp rise and good cycles. 

Then we went through the list of causes of MCs and how they manifest.
Parental Chromosomal Abnormalities:Balanced translocation, Chromosome inversion,Aneuploidy (incomplete set of chromosomes). Generally this this case, a fetal pole is formed. 

Autoimmune Disorders: Antiphospholipid syndrome. These cases the embryo develops further than a fetal pole. Then at some point, due to clotting disorders, the placenta is no longer supported resulting in loss.

Alloimmune Disorders:prevents the mother from developing an immune response that will protect the developing fetus from immune rejectionThere is no proven technique to diagnose or treat. This is an unfortunate place to be. 

Structural Uterine Abnormalities: adhesions, septum formations, fibroids. From previous ultrasounds my uterus looked normal, there was a mention of some fibroids. Fibroids can become an issue. Here though the time of loss is generally later. In this case the fibroid interferes with the growing embryo and irritates it; this may result in bleeding. One has to wait and hope that the pregnancy continues safely. 

Cervical Incompetence:This type of loss is later in pregnancy and there is definite signs of incompetant cervix.

Endocrine Disorders: 
 PCOS - unlikely if cycles are regular. 
 Luteal Phase Defects (LPDs) - unlikely if able to get and stay pregnant for a while. 
 Thyroid Disease:-Testing for this is cheap and easy, no harm in getting it done. It is quite common in women so thyroid is checked anyways. BO is not necessarily caused by this. 
 Diabetes: NA . 
 Factor V Leiden and prothrombin G20210A mutation.Other, less common deficiencies include anticoagulant protein C, protein S, antithrombin III and (MTHFR) gene. (did not have time to get into this). American doctors are always in a rush!  

Infectious Disease and Embryotoxicity: Listeria monocytogenes, toxoplasma gondii, rubella, herpes simplex, measles, cytomegalovirus, and coxsackievirus, may lead to infrequent RSA. (did not have time to get into this)

Doc did not recommend testing for DH - sperm seem to be doing their job. they found the egg twice... now only if my eggs will figure out how to keep it all together! 

Asked doc about acupuncture - she said it can be relaxing and help reduce cortisol so maybe that's where I should put my money! 

Advice from doc: Keep staying healthy, don't start smoking, don't start doing cocaine, keep trying. 

The though of trying again without knowing anything is difficult for me. I know I am lucky to have normal health and we may be able to have babies some day. But I have become anxious about getting pregnant (or not) and worrying what the outcome may be. A big part of me wants to just get off this train and focus my energy on other useful projects, work and enjoying DINK lifestyle with DH.

<p>The opk is positive. I had a positive yesterday too. The day before it was dark, but probably not a true positive. Problem is, the HCG is not quite out of my system. Three days ago, I had a pretty clear pink line left over from my d&amp;c on the 11th. I was 8.5-9 weeks when I had a MMC. Right now there&#39;s a line on my Wondfo, but it&#39;s very light. (picks up at around 20hcg) It&#39;s gotten a lot lighter in the past three days. (Now it looks like the test I took when I got my first BFP.) The ovulation test got darker. </p>

<p>Is it even possible to still O with Hcg a bit over 20 still in my system? I had a D&amp;C on the 11th and counted it as day 1. Today is day 14. Bleeding stopped three days ago. I have had EWCM since yesterday and could have sworn I felt ovulation pains that day. </p>

<p>DF and I originally planned to wait one cycle. We aren&#39;t used to condoms, and we had one just slip off today. Being in the moment we were like, whatever. But if I get pregnant again this cycle, would it be healthy? I have low Progesterone...should I start taking the supplements now just in case something sticks? Argh. Should&#39;ve waited, but we want a baby so badly. I was worried about the thickness of the wall and any complications that might arise from conceiving only 2 weeks after d&amp;c, but, I can&#39;t find anything scientific saying it&#39;s unsafe...  </p>

I have a close friend who lost her baby a few days after she was born. She has been open on social media (by posting articles, etc) about how painful it is when people pretend the baby didn't exist or avoid the topic or even give platitudes like ""you'll have other children"", as if that would erase the loss. You sound like a really thoughtful friend who would not do that, of course. 

My friend has said acknowledging her daughter any and all the time is so helpful.  I wrote her and her husband a letter and acknowledged their loss with a small ornament with their daughter's name on it right afterwards. I get in touch with her around her daughter's birthday and anytime I think of her. When I was in town where she lives last year, she and I got together and I asked her to tell me about her daughter (this was a couple years after their loss at least). She cried because she was so appreciative that I wanted to hear about her daughter and told me her whole story. We both cried and it was a very connecting moment for us. I just listened and acknowledged her loss.  

People act like talking about one's grief will ""remind"" those grieving as if they would ever forget...my husband has been dealing with this since he lost his mom last year. People also assume that a year is enough time to grieve and it is not. It might get easier in some ways or you get used to the loss, but in my husband's experience grief comes in waves and the smallest moment in life can trigger another wave. My mother lost a child who was only a few days old before me and my siblings were born and his birthday and death anniversary remain hard for her some 40 years later. 

Anyway, you sound like a great friend and I would do your best to provide space while every now and then letting them know you're here and doing anything (meals, cards, etc) that can help to acknowledge what they are going through.

And then I spiraled downward from there. My midwife explained that your serotonin gets replenished when you sleep, but if you can't sleep, it creates this vicious cycle and makes your mood worse and then continues to inhibit you from sleeping. Zoloft blocks the receptors that uptake serotonin so it allows your body to keep reusing the serotonin. They also gave me ambien for sleep which I used every night for about 2 weeks then transitioned off to melatonin as needed. Just getting sleep helped immensely and the Zoloft takes about a month to kick in but it did help a lot. My anxiety is much improved.

I was already trying about everything else in the books to try to feel better (counseling, journaling, walking outside, exercise, talking it out, I mean I tried lots of stuff).
