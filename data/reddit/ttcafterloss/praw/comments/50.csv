I’ve been given diet tips as well but not followed them very closely. Acupuncture is traditional Chinese medicine so any diet advice is going to be in line with TCM beliefs. Mine told me, for example, that foods that are shaped like an organ will benefit that organ (kidney beans for healthy kidneys). She told me to eat warm foods after ovulation when I was TTC, to chew all my food extra well, things like that.

Acupuncture is all about keeping the energy flowing throughout your entire body and removing any blockages. For that reason I think once a week is perfect for a beginner, or every other week if it’s too expensive. After a few months you’ll get the same benefits by going once a month.

So it's my 23rd birthday. The day before Thanksgiving. The few weeks before my first, I was having what I would describe as back BH and it was MISERABLE. I'd wake up in the middle of the night screaming. So the day I was in labor, I didn't have any of that, and I felt great. It was only after my 40w visit to the OB where he did a check and said ""uh... you're 5 cm, you should go home and eat a sandwich, then go to the hospital."" I did that, but I also had to finish up my undergraduate thesis before we went to the hospital. 

So we get there. I walk into L&D. Hang out. I watch a South Park marathon (no cable at home). My contractions are never regular. 10 minutes, 2 minutes, 15 minutes, 7 minutes, 17 minutes. Nurses decide I'm not progressing, and the on-call OB goes home. Things really start kicking in around midnight. Finally 10 cm, failed epidural, back labor. Urge to push kicks in and I tell the nurse. She has the gall to say ""the doctor is on her way, hold it in."" HOLD IT IN?! ARE YOU KIDDING ME JESSICA?! OB shows up in time to catch, doesn't get the memo that I'm med-free by total accident, and starts stiching me up without drugs. That was the worst part for sure. 

But just about everything normal for that birth flew right out the window. Wth, non-timable contractions? Who has ever heard of that? Who ever thought you could have no idea you were in active labor??? I spent about 8h in the hospital before birth. And all but the hour before and the 30 min of pushing were really bearable compared to my weeks of back BH.

<p>So we get there. I walk into L&amp;D. Hang out. I watch a South Park marathon (no cable at home). My contractions are never regular. 10 minutes, 2 minutes, 15 minutes, 7 minutes, 17 minutes. Nurses decide I&#39;m not progressing, and the on-call OB goes home. Things really start kicking in around midnight. Finally 10 cm, failed epidural, back labor. Urge to push kicks in and I tell the nurse. She has the gall to say &quot;the doctor is on her way, hold it in.&quot; HOLD IT IN?! ARE YOU KIDDING ME JESSICA?! OB shows up in time to catch, doesn&#39;t get the memo that I&#39;m med-free by total accident, and starts stiching me up without drugs. That was the worst part for sure. </p>

<p>But just about everything normal for that birth flew right out the window. Wth, non-timable contractions? Who has ever heard of that? Who ever thought you could have no idea you were in active labor??? I spent about 8h in the hospital before birth. And all but the hour before and the 30 min of pushing were really bearable compared to my weeks of back BH.</p>

<p>So magical. /s</p>

A coworker of mine whose wife just gave birth a couple of weeks ago came back into the office today. They actually had a really scary time, not sure what the issues were exactly. I felt so bad that they were going through such a terrifying time, not sure if their little girl would make it. Seems like she's fine now, and the coworker was really thoughtful and sensitive to my situation (he and everyone else know about my loss at 20 weeks which happened about 6 weeks ago), careful to check in before sending a birth announcement to the company over email etc, because he didn't want to upset me. 

Meanwhile, another coworker just came over and very loudly bestowed a baby gift on him, which was a little dress, and it got everyone's attention, including mine. I wasn't even going to have a girl (I already have a 16 month old daughter, in fact), and frankly, the dress was ugly, but it still made me upset. It's so weird to be able to feel happy for my coworker that his baby is healthy, and simultaneously upset to see baby gifts being passed around.

Two other coworkers' wives are due at the same time in February that my son would have been born had things gone according to plan. So while the ugly dress gift moment was a minor emotional bump, I'm not actually sure how I'll survive their baby announcements in February, on top of coping with living through my own due date. Thinking of booking a week away to just hopefully miss those birth announcements entirely and cope with my loss away from work. I keep joking to my husband that I'm actually allowed to get Zika now that I'm not pregnant so we should go somewhere tropical that I wouldn't have been able to go to before... He doesn't find it funny but I sure do.

<li><p>Thanksgiving was awful. My due date is approaching, and the MC actually happened the last time that I visited my in-laws for a holiday (Passover/Easter). Not only was I not pregnant this time, but I was PMS&#39;ing. This weekend can be summarized by: too much small talk, not enough patience.</p></li>
<li><p>I think DH and I might TTC again this cycle, since the due date would fall comfortably after next summer&#39;s move. I&#39;m terrified. Also, my mother and her husband will be visiting for my entire fertile window, so who knows how that will work. Plus, if I DO get pregnant, I guarantee that she will do the math and figure out when we conceived. Awesome.</p></li>
<li><p>The higher dose of the thyroid pills seems to be working. Even though my endo doesn&#39;t think this caused my MC, I can&#39;t help but feel hopeful that it will be helpful.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>I am sending everyone here love over the holiday season. No matter what you celebrate, dealing with this stuff while everyone else is posting baby pictures and talking about family is not easy. Thank goodness we&#39;re a strong bunch - or at least try to be. &lt;3 &lt;3 </p>

I don't want to sound like a broken record on this sub but mindfulness meditation has really helped me with this kind of rumination spiral.

I have found that the act of meditating itself has not been easy or necessarily pleasant, but the effect on my day-to-day feelings and mental behaviour have been huge. Practising focusing on what is going on right in front of me for 40 mins a day has been such a game-changer.

I've seen some people say that just jumping in with a purchase makes it easier to do more. But really, babies need a few coverings (blankets/swaddles/PJs), food source (bottles/formula/titties), diapers (just pick some up on the way home from the hospital or Amazon them to your house, after you steal a bunch from said hospital), and a safe place to sleep (pack n play, crib, bassinet, a drawer, or a box with some holes in it). Not much. Other things you can get after they're here. But really, it's 3-4 things you need-need. Hopefully it's not that scary if it's only 3 things.

So I&#39;m just planning on buying her new stuff and gifting the old nursery to this baby <sup>in</sup> <sup>theory.</sup> So we&#39;ve started doing that. Bought her a duvet, considering buying her a new dresser this week with coupons and deals (I wanted a dresser for the baby when it comes for their stuff, even if we don&#39;t get a full-blown nursery set up by then), I was considering going to buy a nursing chair next week (which my daughter could have in her room if this doesn&#39;t work out). </p>

<p>I&#39;ve seen some people say that just jumping in with a purchase makes it easier to do more. But really, babies need a few coverings (blankets/swaddles/PJs), food source (bottles/formula/titties), diapers (just pick some up on the way home from the hospital or Amazon them to your house, after you steal a bunch from said hospital), and a safe place to sleep (pack n play, crib, bassinet, a drawer, or a box with some holes in it). Not much. Other things you can get after they&#39;re here. But really, it&#39;s 3-4 things you need-need. Hopefully it&#39;s not that scary if it&#39;s only 3 things.</p>

<p>You could also wrap up the things like presents, just in case <sup>God</sup> <sup>forbid</sup> something happens, and it might be easier to remove. I dunno. :|</p>

It definitely takes me a while to find it but it’s such a relief to have this.

We had a nice thanksgiving yesterday, just watching the parade. We decided to skip all family obligations this year. My brother and his family have a one week old— they live less than an hour away from us and we normally go there for the holidays but just couldn’t do it this year. We had reservations at Ruth’s Chris and it was amazing to not have to do any prep or cleanup or family photos where all the kids are whining. My 3 year old behaved remarkably well in such a fancy restaurant and we just ended up having a really pleasant time. 

My husband and I went to Ruth’s Chris for our anniversary in June, and sat there crying into our steaks and hoping that we would be too busy with a new baby to be able to have such an elaborate dinner for our next anniversary. It was nice to be there in a more hopeful mindframe last night. 

My parents did spend thanksgiving at my brother’s house then drove up to see us today before heading home. We managed to have a pleasant visit without too much talk about my new nephew and I was fortunately feeling fully functional so didn’t give anything away. 

My siblings and I have our kids do a cousin gift exchange now that we all have kids— each child picks a name— not their sibling— to choose a gift for. That way we aren’t stuck buying gifts for six nieces and nephews, just for the amount of kids we actually have. My mom usually coordinates the name selection and videos it for us all to see which kid is getting which cousin a gift. I told my mom to be sure to include Sam this year. We want whichever child who gets matched with his name to choose a toy to donate to a toy drive in his honor, or maybe donate diapers and/or formula to a womens’ shelter or something along those lines. My husband and daughter and I will be doing that in Sam’s name this year as well. And probably every year forever.

I have the buggy and if something happens we&#39;ll have to deal with putting stuff away anyway.&quot; Also, you bought the stroller when it was the right moment... right stroller, right deal... which is much better as being in a rushed shopping-panic at the end. I think you will be fine :-) Don&#39;t let what happened spoil all the joy of nesting! </p>

1. I know I've been tested for Lupus and clotting disorders. A previous doctor did an enormous workup last year. I brought it to my RE and she said it's way more tests than she would ever order, but they were all normal so nothing to investigate further. I will ask about the specific conditions mentioned here when I see an Endocrinologist, as opposed to my RE, soon. My RE gave me a referral to start taking a special Folate as well in case of MTHFR.

2. My Hashimoto's has been extremely well managed for 15 years. I got bloodwork yesterday to test my antibodies and my RE messaged me saying I didn't have any, so she doesn't think that caused this loss, which is good since there wouldn't be an easy ""fix"" for that if it was the case. I am going to ask for a Vitamin D test at my next appt. She also told me it can't hurt to add Selenium to my supplement routine.

3. I am looking forward to changing my diet to help me feel better, lose weight, and any benefits to my autoimmune disease will be a bonus. I did an elimination diet a few years ago and found the same to be true about dairy, I cut out all milk but occasionally have cheese. I am looking at the various autoimmune diets, there's more than I expected. Do you have one you recommend over another? I worry about being too strict, I love nuts and seeds and beans. I could do without most carbs, but giving up nuts and beans would be so hard. 

4. GC is most likely completely out of the question financially. So I am hoping that if we just keep trying, until we absolutely can't anymore, we will just get lucky eventually. 

5. I agree about the sperm test, but in addition to grieving he is very tired of all of this, understandably, so will probably wait until the new year and hopefully he will be up for it even though we aren't covered for that specific test.

6. The first losses were at almost the exact same time (except for one CP) and they chalked it up to my having a uterine septum which cuts off blood supply to the baby after a certain point - for me this was always around 6w5d and then the baby stopped developing. I never knew until I went in for an ultrasound, so all of those 3 were MMC. I had the septum removed and this was my first pregnancy since that surgery.

It is almost certainly not a chromosomal issue if the testing shows no imbalance. 

1. Has she tested you for thrombophilia or auto-immune diseases? This includes anti-phospholipid syndrome. A full workup would include DRVVT, Lupus Anticoagualant, Anti-cardiolipin antibodies, anti-beta-2-glycoprotein-1 antibodies, anti-phosphatidylserine antibodies, and anti-annexin 5 antibodies. A basic thrombophilia panel would include factor V leiden, MTHFR, Prothombin mutation, PAI 4g/5g. A more complete one (likely ordered by a hematologist) would include testing the activity and levels of the various clotting factors. If you don't want to go through the testing, you are always free to consider lovenox and aspirin.

2. What are you doing for the hashimoto's? I am a man, so hashimoto's doesn't affect our fertility, but I do have hashimoto's, and I do think I feel better when the antibodies are lower. In woman though, the antibody level is an independent factor in pregnancy loss. For me at least, Selenium and megadoses of vitamin D helped to cut my antibodies by more than half. I would absolutely ask for a vitamin D test. Mine was in the low end of the range, almost bordering on clinically low. The 2000 IU/day dose did not succeed in raising them at all. I had to take 12000 IU for a few months to get it in mid-range, and now take 10000 IU/day to sustain it. I've found this works for me. 

3. I would highly recommend the auto-immune diet, for both weight loss and the auto-immune properties. While I didn't notice any change in antibody levels during the six months we went paleo, I did notice I felt better. It also helped me notice lactose intolerance, which has the added benefit of helping my stomach feel better.

4. It's your decision of course, but a GC is not the only way to have a baby. It is somewhat common -- especially in women with auto-immune disease -- to simply conceive and carry a baby to term when the disease is in remission. You are always free to keep trying. 

5. A sperm fragmentation test on your husband is likely a good idea.

6. How far along do you usually get? Or are the losses all over the place? Do you go into labor or do you experience intrauterine fetal demise? These are important questions. If the losses occur somewhat randomly, there may be a thrombophilia at play. Nevertheless, the prognosis for random losses is actually pretty good. If the babies die without you going into labor, this has different causes then going into labor while the baby is alive.

I found it hard to watch, as my husband and I fought constantly—especially after my second miscarriage. Though we are working on this now, it made me sad to think how much less terrible it could’ve been for me if he’d been there for me.

As my daughter was not yet 20 weeks, I didn't get maternity leave or even bereavement leave, so I had to use up my sick and vacation time to handle her miscarriage. Going back to work a mere week later was brutal. I won't describe it in detail, because that's not what you need.

Every period feels like a giant ""fuck you"" from my body, and it doesn't help that the hormones accompany it. 

But it does get better. There are days when it's easier to breathe. It's not a betrayal of your child to laugh, when that does happen. And it's not horrible of you to ignore people you'd normally attempt pleasantries with.

I just finished my 24 hour urine test. Weee. I have to take it in today but I can pee normally again. To say that was annoying is an understatement, but I also know it wasn't that big of a deal.

Yesterday my BP definitely spiked - I could tell. I laid down for a bit, then took it and it was still way too high. I just laid there feeling weird for quite some time. It never reached ""call doctors"" levels, so that's good. BUT it has me on edge for the next few weeks. 

I've been given a 39 week deadline. Even if my hypertension doesn't turn into pre-e, they want him OUT. So, *less than 4 weeks left, max.*

I did really well with anxiety about losing him for about 10 weeks and now its fully ramped up again. I don't know what to do about it but I'm trying to stay chill. Eek.

You will always grieve the future you envisioned for your family - but slowly (at your own pace) the sadness moves more into the background. 

My advice for now is to just be. Don’t fight the feelings you’re having, don’t try and push them away. These are emotions you need to feel to begin to process what you’ve been through and lost. If you need to zone out - binge watching Netflix helped me a lot during the early days.

Almost 3 months ago, my baby boy died 4 hours after he was born. We had a totally healthy pregnancy up until 35 weeks, then I stopped feeling him move.

We were supposed to have a procedure done to drain the fluid before delivery, but my water broke before we could. It has been the worst pain I have ever experienced, from the moment he was born until the moment he died in my arms. 

I told you my story because I want you to know you’re not alone, and that None of this is your fault.

For us, we’re waiting for the autopsy results to tell us if this was genetic and something that I or his daddy passed down.

My 2 year old is the only thing keeping me alive, and I would not survive if this happened to us again.

As painful as it all is right now, please take some comfort in knowing that everything you are feeling is totally normal. 

You won’t always feel like this. As time passes, the intensity and rawness of your grief will diminish, and you’ll be able to find more moments of lightness.

I did wake up in pain and they gave me fentanyl. I was too out of it to refuse...if you don&#39;t want that let them know ahead of time what meds are acceptable. I spotted for a few days then it picked up to steady bleeding. I&#39;m 10 days post surgery and still have light cramps. Back to spotting but barely. All the best wishes to you, you&#39;ll do great!</p>

Your Recombine CarrierMap genetic testing results are ready.

Dr. RE has requested that you review your results with one of Recombine’s genetic counselors. Please note that genetic counseling is a complimentary part of our service recommended for all patients, regardless of your results.”

Though they say it is recommended for all patients it is the “Dr. RE has requested that you review your results with one of Recombine’s genetic counselors” part that has me a little freaked out. Like something is wrong that they need to discuss with us. We scheduled the meeting for 1pm on Sunday, so at least we don’t have to wait too long for the results.

Yesterday, my brother called me to tell me his third son had been born. I’ve been expecting this call any day now, so when I saw it was him calling I was unsurprised and kind of just ready to get it overwith. My first question was if everyone was doing okay (they are) and my second was what the baby’s name is. I was so relieved when he told me— it isn’t the boy name we’ve been holding onto. The one we were supposed to use in May but decided to hang onto in the hopes of having a living son to bear it someday. And that relief was my overwhelming feeling for the duration of the conversation. But after we hung up the phone and I reflected on the conversation a bit, I started to get annoyed at some of the things he had said. When he acknowledged that he knew this was hard for me, he said, “it’s been hard for us too.” I get what he meant by that— in the wake of Sam’s death, a pregnancy and healthy birth in our family has become more complicated. But the phrasing just rubbed me the wrong way. Like, don’t tell me that having a healthy son has been hard for you. If that’s the case, feel free to tell literally anyone else that, but don’t lay that at my feet. It only makes me feel horrible, because I already struggle with so much guilt about not being able to keep my baby alive, and about devastating not just me and my husband and my daughter, but everyone who was expecting this baby to add joy to our world. And it also makes me feel shitty because it’s just another clumsy reminder of how hard this actually IS for me, and someone who just watched a healthy baby delivered mentioning his own pain at this just seems disingenuous for so many reasons. (He wasn’t the one who had a csection, for starters... and he isn’t the one with the effing dead baby and all the emotional baggage that carries to sort through for the rest of his life....)

Anyways, the conversation has just really been under my skin since yesterday. It made me think of that Circle of Kvetching— yesterday my brother dumped in, and that was not cool, and doubly uncool on a day that was undoubtedly extremely happy for them.  

In retrospect, I wish I had directed them to have my mom call me with the news and the name. It would have been easier to tell her not to offer me any emotional editorializing. Instead I just tried to get off the phone with my brother as quickly as I reasonably could. 

I will say that having this pregnancy ongoing has offered a slight buffer against the news. As much as I try to check my feelings and prevent getting overly excited, it’s undeniable that I am in a different place than I was a few months ago. I don’t have that same desperation to be pregnant, and I DO have some hope, however hard I work to ignore it.

Our families don’t know about this pregnancy yet. I’m not sure when we’ll tell them (we have kind of tentatively said we’ll wait for the anatomy scan but haven’t really talked about it much because we’re both so scared to spend much time acknowledging this pregnancy) but I’ve begun idly considering how we would tell them, when the time comes. My husband told his boss for logistical reasons, and the reaction was surprise and confusion about why we tried so soon after such a loss. So I anticipate that a lot of the reaction (from family and the general public) will be along the lines of “is that really safe?” or “is this a smart thing to do from a mental health standpoint?” or “oh, I’m so glad you’ve moved on now.” And I’m not quite sure how to address any of that, since those are all dumb things to say.",[],,t1_dpyoiei,False,0,[],False,"<div class=""md""><p>10 weeks today. 🎈 </p>

This pregnancy-wise, things seem okay. 14 weeks today! I have an OB appointment with my favorite OB (who will hopefully be with me all pregnancy) on Tuesday. Anatomy scan a week after that.

It's been a roller-coaster of a couple weeks!

After my last post (not sure where I left off in comments) I had an ultrasound to see if there was any remaining tissue in my uterus and Slightly check for an ectopic. They didn't see anything and checked my # again. It'd had risen yet again so they sent me on to a gynecologist in the next town. They determined a d&c would be the best first step. So I had that done last Friday. My # on Monday went up, again. So they had me do a urine test to rule out a false positive and then another ultrasound once the urine test came back positive. This was on Tuesday. I met with the Dr and he recommended laproscopic exploratory surgery. I mentioned methotrexate, but he said with no guarantee of success and excess monitoring he always uses surgery. I asked about maintaining future fertility as much as possible and he said there is no major difference between the two. So, we scheduled surgery for yesterday. He'd said they'd try to save my tube if possible but once they got in there he said he was shocked that I wasn't in pain for how swollen it was/on the verge of rupturing as I understand. So here I sit, down one tube and recovering from surgery. They were able to save the ovary, though which was a slight relief. I am so glad I decided to go the route of surgery vs the shot just because it could have taken a turn for the worst real quick!

 Sorry for the wall of text. I plan to make an update post tomorrow from computer with better formatting & more details!! :) but that is the jist if it!

And I feel super queasy today so that’s a good reassurance. But if I have any red bleeding I won’t hesitate to be checked out. 

Today I have a standing appointment with my endocrinologist— not an RE, she’s just been following my thyroid since my last pregnancy. I’m on a really low dose of levothyroxine and have been for four years since I first started TTC and had two CPs in a row, so she just monitors my TSH levels. I really liked her in my last pregnancy but this is another one of those things that’s harder for me since my stillbirth. She was very nice and sympathetic at my first appointment postpartum, but at my second, she had completely forgotten about the stillbirth and I felt kind of rushed in and out. Maybe it was just a bad day, but like, my GOD take three seconds to refresh yourself on my chart before you walk in to the exam room.

I know she’ll be happy to hear I’m almost ten weeks, though, once we get all the reminders out of the way.

A bit of background: I had a missed miscarriage where baby only grew to 6 weeks. I took misoprostol sept 1 and unfortunately it didn't clear everything out. I took another round two weeks later which again didn't work completely. I had about 2cm sq of tissue left so had a d&c sept 30. The surgeon said I should wait two cycles before we try again to give my body a break. 

I'm currently waiting to ovulate in my second cycle post d&c and the wait is just killing me. I was supposed to have a follow up apt with the surgeon yesterday but she was on an unexpected leave of absence and it's not clear when she will return. I wanted to ask her if she feels it's ok for us to try this cycle. I have been expecting to ovulate now since CD11. I've had EWCM every day since and I'm on CD27 and going a little crazy (I temp too so no temperature spike yet). 

So I know no one here can give me the same advice as my dr, but we really want to try this cycle, and of course we'll wait if it's a large risk of another MC if we try now but... is it really a high risk?? 

For those of you who had a d&c, how long did you wait before trying? I don't want to make an irrational decision to try because I'm so emotional about it. But I also don't want to wait if it's unnecessary. I'm sure many of you understand.

But I can’t seem to settle down for a nap and (TW: LC) my daughter just woke up from hers so I guess I’ve missed my opportunity anyways.

Yesterday at my MFM, in the waiting room I happened to see my L&D nurse, who also happens to run the local support group. I knew she was probably there for another patient who has received devastating news (she’s the head of the perinatal loss team at the local hospital) and that broke my heart.  (Just to clarify, she’s like, grandma age so I was sure she wasn’t there for her own pregnancy.) We chatted for a few minutes in the waiting room— I mentioned to her at our last meeting that I was eight weeks so she wasn’t surprised to see me there other than the timing of us happening to overlap on our visits.  She’s been such a beacon of hope for me ever since she walked into the triage room after we learned our baby didn’t have a heartbeat and poured all of her compassion over me and my husband.

<p>Yesterday at my MFM, in the waiting room I happened to see my L&amp;D nurse, who also happens to run the local support group. I knew she was probably there for another patient who has received devastating news (she’s the head of the perinatal loss team at the local hospital) and that broke my heart.  (Just to clarify, she’s like, grandma age so I was sure she wasn’t there for her own pregnancy.) We chatted for a few minutes in the waiting room— I mentioned to her at our last meeting that I was eight weeks so she wasn’t surprised to see me there other than the timing of us happening to overlap on our visits.  She’s been such a beacon of hope for me ever since she walked into the triage room after we learned our baby didn’t have a heartbeat and poured all of her compassion over me and my husband.

I just pulled up my lab results for my clotting tests and it looks like they took about 2-3 days to result...morning on Monday blood was taken, results available Wednesday or Thursday afternoon (there were multiple tests).

I'm actually starting to consider the possibility of bringing a baby home. The main thing on my mind is if I want to find out the sex or not. I got the NIPT, so technically I already have the (unread) results, and husband wants to find out at the 21w anatomy scan. [TW:LC] For our daughter, he kept it in for 3 months until I was ready, and surprised me. He wants to do the same thing this time to try and bring some joy back into the pregnancy for us (though I doubt I'd wait 3 months this time). 

But I just don't know. I know a lot of you guys won't empathize with this, but I'm trying to set myself up for having another daughter. I love my daughter, she's awesome. She would LOVE a little sister to play with and dress up and I can just imagine how sweet it would be. But I so want to believe my that my son is still here, just in a new body. I want to be able to let my husband pass on his family name (literally; past 3 generations of first-born males in his family have the same first name and different middle names that start with the same initial). I don't want to feel like a failure that I can't carry a boy, and I don't want to feel the pressure to get pregnant again for a boy.

But at the same time, I'm going to be crushed if it's a boy. There was never any reason that my first son died, and it all just seems so unfair. I think I'll never be able to stop wondering ""what if? would my first son have been/done XYZ?"" To be compared to someone who barely exist for the whole of your life is so unfair.

The doctor who graduated me wasn’t my usual doctor, so I’m not sure he was aware of my stillbirth, so I’m not sure if he was aware that MFM should ideally be seeing me throughout pregnancy to manage risk there. But my midwife confirmed at my appointment last week that MFM will follow me this pregnancy, staggered between regular checkup visits. She gave me a referral for NIPT, which they will ideally be able to perform for me today (I’m 9+3, so they may opt to wait until next week since I know they prefer to wait until ten weeks sometimes to ensure enough fetal DNA is present...?)

I saw this particular doctor in my last pregnancy for a subchorionic hemorrhage (apparently I’m prone to them) so I’m already comfortable with him and have a few questions prepared.

1. What can I expect as far as monitoring with your office throughout this pregnancy? How often will visits be, will they always include an ultrasound, will there be anything special this time around that I didn’t have last time? 

2. I want my delivery scheduled no later than 38 weeks. Will I need a csection (I had one with my first) or will induction be an option for me assuming all other things are norma? (IE, no breech presentation, other health obstacles making labor undesirable.)

3. I’m on progesterone suppositories per the RE. They told me to stop them cold turkey on the 16th but I have a lot of anxiety about this, given that low progesterone was the barrier to achieving pregnancy between my stillbirth and this pregnancy. Is there any drawback to staying on it for a few more weeks and how should I wean off it when the time comes?

4. Slightly more superficially— we have a trip to Disney World scheduled in late January. We’ve held off on booking plane and park tickets until a doctor signed off on the trip— is it okay to go, or do we cancel the resort? (No biggie— can be done without penalty until 30 days prior, but I do think it would be a nice thing for our family to do after having the crappiest year ever.)

Does anyone else have any suggestions on questions I should have up my sleeve? Particularly those of you with second and third trimester losses— anything I’m missing or questions you wanted answered by the perinatologist at your first visit?

UPDATE: everything looked good at MFM, I go back in two weeks for my NT scan. The doctor reassured me that I could come in anytime I feel the need. There is still a tiny little bit of hematoma so I could still have some bleeding but he wasn’t concerned by it. He wasn’t optimistic about induction, which is fine. We’ll revisit it later but I told him my only real preference was a scheduled delivery NLT 38 weeks. A VBAC would just be preferable, not crucial. He said there may be some things we can do depending on what my body is doing at that stage but we’ll cross that bridge when we get to it, which was fine by me. He told me to keep on using the progesterone if it made me feel better, because it can’t do any damage, and blessed our trip to Disney World, so I’m excited to start planning that! That’ll be at the like 19 week point, roughly, so we’ll probably have had an anatomy scan and as long as everything looks good it’ll be a nice way to kind of mark my halfway point, hopefully.

When I was pregnant with my son, I did 3x week high-intensity workouts. He passed at 16 weeks, I delivered at 18 weeks. A few months go by, and I get into running 6x a week. Then I got pregnant again, decided to keep running as long as I was able.

I was reading a book called Trying Again around 5-6 weeks, which specifically mentions to stop working out if you've had a 2nd-trimester loss. I called my OB, who said ""oh yeah, don't do what you're doing."" OB said walking until 12 weeks, and then we'd talk about it again. I straight up stopped, and just walked a few times a week per his recomendation. At 12 weeks, he said go slow, but that running wasn't a problem, especially the run-walk-run method I use. Frankly, I've just never gotten back into it (fractured my foot around then). I was going to start trying to walk 30 minutes/ 5x a week and/or throw some yoga in there to start prepping my birth muscles again around now.

Some digging revealed [this article](https://academic.oup.com/aje/article/167/7/859/83542). This gets a little complicated, so bear with me. The article's raw data would suggest that low impact exercises (e.g., walking) reduced the risk of loss a smidge, but high-intensity exercises (e.g., running, elliptical, hiking ^?!) raised it a bit. The idea is that long periods of high-intensity exercise can reduce blood flow through the placenta and to the fetus. This association appears to disapear after 18 weeks, when the risk of loss for most exercise types is very similar. Then statistics happen, and that's exceedingly complicated, but the final recommendation was that exercise is good, but under 2 hours a week, and low-impact. They do comment on the apparent association between high-impact excerise and increased rates of loss before 18 weeks, but try to sort of explain it away with ""there's probably another factor here we didn't think about,"" ^which ^I ^hate!!!

So, TL;DR: some associations between loss and high-intensity excercise before 18 weeks found, but unlikely to be the cause.

I've done a few things to try not to ruminate about wanting a baby too much, mainly things that help me focus on the here and now:

Stuff that's specific to my body as well because it can feel tempting to blame and distrust my body or label it as broken (so the body scan meditation has been helpful)

- pursuing non-TTC-compatible goals like weight loss (which messed with ovulation timing for me when I was trying)

Interestingly as a side effect I have spent less time on Reddit (though I get sucked in sometimes e.g. yesterday) - I think this place is wonderful but it can be self-torture if you're not disciplined about avoiding things that might derail you.

Like results / BFP threads. I think I&#39;m ready for those sometimes, but I&#39;m not. </p>

Yes, me. I've had 2 early losses, and 2 losses halfway through pregnancy (21 weeks and 20+3). Both later losses chromosomally normal according to FISH and microarray. 

I live in New England and have seen doctors at the best Ivy League university hospitals. The MFMs mostly think there's an undetectable genetic issue (we've had carrier screenings through Counsyl, karyotyping, and microarray done on the 21 week loss - but there are genetic issues that lie WITHIN each chromosome that cannot be detected through karyotyping and microarray. Which was mindblowing to me. And frustrating.) 

One doctor in Boston at not-a-fancy-Ivy League hospital recommended Lovenox because not all blood clotting problems have tests for them, apparently. And since that's something I can actually DO? I'm doing it. Who know if it'll help. We'll be done trying after this baby if it ends in another stillbirth, since we do have 2 living children and I hate this roller coaster. 

Hope that helps in some way. I know I was desperate for information, too. I'm also doing 20 mg of prednisone for first two trimesters as a part of throwing everything at this one last try.

I am feeling pretty fine today— no nausea, so of course I’m panicking even though I know that symptoms come and go and they have come and gone in this pregnancy and I’ve still seen a heartbeat following a reduction in symptoms.

I have an old friend from way back in middle school who had a son two weeks after Sam was born. She texted me last night and had asked me if we had sleep trained my daughter— now 3. I have made no secret about the fact that we have just slowly succumbed into acceptance that my daughter just sleeps in our bed and probably will until she’s old enough to be embarrassed by that, so I don’t know why anyone would ask me for my advice on sleep training, since our situation is considered most parents’ worst nightmare. (And then when they tell us that, which everyone likes to do, we remind them that we buried our son and ACTUALLY lived their worst parental nightmare and having a toddler sleep in our bed is barely a blip on the radar in comparison.) 

Anyways, I wasn’t offended by her asking what had worked for us when we were going through it with our daughter, because I was one of the first to have a baby in my friend group— these questions just arise from time to time. But then she saw an opening to complain about her sleeplessness and her husband’s grumbling about it, and I lost it. Doesn’t she realize my husband and I would trade places with them in a heartbeat? I told her she had to find someone else to vent about this with, because if I could be awake at night dealing with a crying baby instead of being awake at night crying over my dead baby, that would be a much happier situation. I told her I understood she was sleep deprived and trying to figure out parenthood but she’d have to find someone else to do this with, because all it does is remind me of all the things I should be doing with my baby but can’t. She apologized but I just don’t care. What kind of complete idiocy does a person need to possess to think that I am an appropriate outlet for this kind of gripe?

I won’t even tell my husband about this one— he already hates her husband so much (with good reason, he’s kind of an a-hole) and he will not have any patience for hearing about a father who is pissy about a baby who won’t sleep. Like, they’re babies, not sleeping is their norm. Figure it out.",[],,t1_dpo5aqd,False,0,[],False,"<div class=""md""><p>9 weeks. 🎈 </p>

I'm 17+3 today. I found out my son had passed at ~16w on 17+5. If I can make it to Thursday (18+1), when I next see my OB, maybe I'll feel better. Maybe the anatomy scan on December 7. Maybe I'll be thrilled when I'm in labor. Maybe when they graduate high school ^and ^move ^the ^hell ^out ^of ^my ^house. I wonder if I'll always be afraid for this baby.

I was uploading photos for our annual photobook this morning, and it was just so terrible. January through April, I was pregnant. **[TW:LC]** I gave my daughter her first haircut this year; she's wearing a ""I'm a Big Sister!"" shirt, because I had told my husband an hour earlier I was pregnant. I went through before and blurred all those, but I'm not to the point of having forgotten yet. Easter, I was clearly pregnant. Throughout it all, my maternity clothes. April was trigger-y as fuck; I look at the dates, and thought, ""and this is the day my son died,"" and ""this day we did X thing, but he was already gone."" I got to May and gave up; it was hard going to May 1st and seeing me trying to interact with my daughter.

Yesterday I was doing decorations for my DD's birthday in a few weeks, and we do that ^stupid milestone chalkboard. All I could think of was ""This year, I became a big sister... twice."" For Christmas, I'm ""getting"" a 3D ultrasound for our family so she can 'meet' the baby. But, will she? Will my daughter ever get to know her siblings? What is wrong with me that I can carry one child, but not another?

I hate this, you guys. Absolutely hate this.

Maybe I&#39;ll be thrilled when I&#39;m in labor. Maybe when they graduate high school <sup>and</sup> <sup>move</sup> <sup>the</sup> <sup>hell</sup> <sup>out</sup> <sup>of</sup> <sup>my</sup> <sup>house.</sup> I wonder if I&#39;ll always be afraid for this baby.</p>

<p>I was uploading photos for our annual photobook this morning, and it was just so terrible. January through April, I was pregnant. <strong>[TW:LC]</strong> I gave my daughter her first haircut this year; she&#39;s wearing a &quot;I&#39;m a Big Sister!&quot; shirt, because I had told my husband an hour earlier I was pregnant. I went through before and blurred all those, but I&#39;m not to the point of having forgotten yet. Easter, I was clearly pregnant. Throughout it all, my maternity clothes. April was trigger-y as fuck; I look at the dates, and thought, &quot;and this is the day my son died,&quot; and &quot;this day we did X thing, but he was already gone.&quot; I got to May and gave up; it was hard going to May 1st and seeing me trying to interact with my daughter.</p>

<p>Yesterday I was doing decorations for my DD&#39;s birthday in a few weeks, and we do that <sup>stupid</sup> milestone chalkboard. All I could think of was &quot;This year, I became a big sister... twice.&quot; For Christmas, I&#39;m &quot;getting&quot; a 3D ultrasound for our family so she can &#39;meet&#39; the baby. But, will she? Will my daughter ever get to know her siblings? What is wrong with me that I can carry one child, but not another?</p>

<p>I hate this, you guys. Absolutely hate this.</p>

<p>On the bright side, this new baby is doing all it can to reassure me that (s)he&#39;s ok. Last night, I felt my first kick from the outside (but, when dad went in for a feel, it promptly went to sleep).</p>

I've been getting HCG labs every 2 weeks, if the next one is ok, it'll move to monthly, likely for 6 months. I did also read the study where they were recommending just a 3 month wait after HCG levels have returned to zero. I mentioned it to my Dr and his recommendation was still a 6 month wait but said if I got pregnant before that it wasn't a terribly big deal. 

The risk of getting pregnant sooner is that very rarely with PMP and less rarely with molar pregnancy, you can develop essentially a form of cancer. It's highly treatable, but the first identifiable sign is an elevated hcg. If you are pregnant it would be difficult to tell whether elevated hcg is from pregnancy alone or the inappropriate overgrowth of cells. It is treatable with chemo, which you would not want to take while pregnant. In my mind, I'm okay with waiting a while for the peace of mind. 

Sucks, tho. Sorry friend. ",[],,t1_dpm9vgu,False,0,[],False,"<div class=""md""><p>I had a PMP that ended in August. I&#39;ve been getting HCG labs every 2 weeks, if the next one is ok, it&#39;ll move to monthly, likely for 6 months. I did also read the study where they were recommending just a 3 month wait after HCG levels have returned to zero. I mentioned it to my Dr and his recommendation was still a 6 month wait but said if I got pregnant before that it wasn&#39;t a terribly big deal. </p>

<p>The risk of getting pregnant sooner is that very rarely with PMP and less rarely with molar pregnancy, you can develop essentially a form of cancer.

I had a massive bleed out at a restaurant in the 6th week of this pregnancy (it soaked the seat that I was on and splashed on the floor). The staff called EMS and had to evacuate the restaurant as there was a literal pool of blood on the floor. Obviously, we assumed it was gone, refused EMS, and we went home as hospitals have pushed us away with early miscarriages before. Over the next few days, all symptoms were gone. 

My HCG rose at a rapid rate over the next week as I cramped and bled. When I finally got my scan, it was determined that I had such a painful huge bleed out due to scar tissue hemorrhaging behind where the sack was attaching. This is common enough in women with multiple miscarriages or who have had surgery that no one was concerned. In the 6th week, the embryo buries in more and if you have scar tissue it can cause bleeding and cramping. I didn’t know this before but it didn’t make the terror any easier.

I wish I could give you more info. I hate the wait. All the waiting and worry of TTC and then more worry after the positive test. I understand mourning the loss right now. I did. I honestly almost drank during the bleed out because how could something survive? Somehow mine did. I’m at 10 wks going strong and starting to have hope.  

I hope you get the answers you need soon. It’s awful to wait.

Like you I did mine own research.

Please bear with me and all honest feedback is really appreciated. I had a D&C September 1st and took it really hard. I felt like no one understood that my loss was a real loss of a baby I had been trying a year to conceive. I lashed out at my husband for not being as visibly hurt as I felt and was a general mess. Time passed, I felt better, and finally got my period again and was told by my doctor that it was ok for us to start trying again. So we did. I started following the sperm meets egg plan and tracked, plotted and schemed to make sure we had sex on all the right days. I've been in this excrutiating tww since Friday and I thought it was all i could bear to just keep myself from staring at calendars and charts. My husband left Friday to visit his brother in Nashville for the weekend, which left me extra time alone to obsess. I can't lie I have been really anxious, I didn't think it could get worse. That was until tonight. My husband got back from his trip late Monday night, between work, the gym and regular life things we haven't had much time to talk. And if I'm honest I didn't want to since I've been feeling a little annoyed by the fact that he hasn't been especially warm or concerned about how I'm feeling. 
Well tonight shit hit the fan and here's the story I get when I asked my husband what happened in Nashville. Apparently my Husband and his brother got so black out drunk, neither of them remember a girl they'd been hanging out with joining them home in a cab to the apartment...(yea) This young lady supposedly went straight for my brother in law's room expecting to hook up with him, but he sent her away told her to go home because he wasn't interested. The next thing my husband remembers is this girl was on top of him no shirt or bra on kissing him...(stay with me) My husband comes to and freaks out says he's married and the girl leaves. The kicker is she leaves wearing my husbands shirt and leaving her bra and top behind. The girl text my BIL in the morning saying she left her shit behind and they find these articles of clothing under the coffee table next to the couch my husband slept on. MAGIC!
 My mind is whirling. I got this girls phone number from BIL and called. She tells me she also doesn't remember any details and has no idea how she even got home, just knew she didn't have her clothes and that she had been at my BIL apartment. She apologizes profusely the entire time we are on the phone and I respect her for taking my call. 
My husband is sobbing the whole time he's telling the story, and all I'm thinking is how I wish so hard that i'm pregnant but if I am this will forever be tainted by this bullshit.

Meaning that your baby&#39;s heart measures about 2 mm. That&#39;s crazy small. </p>

<p>So they have to be close to the front of your belly, and you have to hit this sweet spot of 2 mm. Crazy that anyone finds it ever.</p>

Firstly, the nurse put me in an exam room that shares a wall with the other doctor's office next door.  That doctor does hip/leg/foot corrections for infants and toddlers who were born with their legs not growing properly. I can't remember the proper term, but one of my nephews was born with it and needs leg casts to correct it. Anyway, through the wall while I waited, all I could hear was ""Say 'I love you, daddy!'"" over and over again, followed by a toddler crying (it's pretty painful to do those corrections!). The instant my RE came in and heard it, he straight away apologized for the nurse putting me in that room, moved me to another room to do the physical exam, then to his office for the follow up discussion. In his words ""I'm sure it's hard enough for you to be here after a loss, without having to hear that."" I was so pitifully grateful for him admitting that. Too many doctors become desensitized to how upsetting things like that can be. I've also come to appreciate that his office is bare of infant/toddler pictures and has only one picture of his own kids that is discreetly located on top of his bookshelf.

My RE is still reluctant to operate on my uterine septum after taking another look at it. He said with how small it is, the risk of losses from scarring is as high as the risk of losses from leaving it alone. Unless he runs out of other options, he suggests leaving it.

However, his first concern is the PCOS - while I'm apparently responding quite well to the metformin, the daily nausea and vomiting is unsustainable and he's recommended I split my dosage - one with breakfast and one with dinner. This should alleviate my morning dry-heaving which will be a huge relief. It will also force me to eat breakfast!

In case we do decide to try again, he's also prescribed Femara/Letrozole for my next CD3 through 7, with an ultrasound somewhere in CD10-13 and an Ovidrel trigger shot after that if I respond appropriately. There's also the minor issue of already having a history of twin pregnancy, and possibility of over-responding. Like many REs, his goal is ONE healthy embryo per pregnancy.

My RE would also make a fantastic therapist - I feel better talking to him than my actual therapist! We talked through my recent major depressive episodes and the biological and social conditioning that is likely behind the renewed severity of my depression and anxiety attacks.

I had my first REAL intake appointment with my midwife where we discussed things like birth expectations, etc. My midwife will not do an induction for a VBAC (my first baby was a csection, second—my stillborn—was a VBAC) so I’m probably going to need a scheduled csection, but MFM will make the call to determine my risk level if I am induced. I️ told my midwife I’d prefer a vaginal delivery if possible but above all else I want this birth scheduled so if a csection is the way to do that, then we’ll schedule a csection. My first was born at 37 weeks due to low fluid, and was a csection because she was breech. My second one had none of those issues and I went into spontaneous labor at 39 weeks, so assuming no other complications, their plan would be to deliver after 37 but before 39 weeks, depending on a variety of factors like NST results, baby’s estimated size, etc. I told her I won’t go past 38 no matter what, and she agreed that that would probably be the deadline established by both the perinatologists and the hospitalists that support my midwifery practice. So, we’ll see— I’m not overly concerned about that just yet because I know I have a lot of people who will help me advocate for myself if this becomes an issue down the road but for now I just feel glad that so many people will be involved in my care with the same goal: to get this baby out of me alive. But there’s a lot of milestones to get through between now and then so I’m just trying to focus on those ones for the time being— like just getting from one appointment to the next.

I meet with MFM for the first time this pregnancy on Tuesday— I think my RE doctor may have gotten some wires crossed and is referring me there for a SCH (which is fine, I want that monitored) but the real reason I need to be there is for continuous care after stillbirth. My midwife told me that they’ll still schedule me for every four weeks for the time being (they’ve just moved all their low risk patients to a 6-week timeframe, so I’m getting seen more often than their average but probably not as often as I️ would like) and that in the interim I’ll be seeing MFM. I know I can call either place if I’m anxious for whatever reason whatsoever, and my therapist and one of the MFM doctors have a very good rapport and she will even call on my behalf if I can’t get in and just HAVE to see the heartbeat. So, we’ll see how MFM wants to schedule me out, but if I can get in at least one office every two weeks I think I’ll be comfortable with that, especially if I can have an open door policy for when my anxiety just gets stretched to its limit.

I should have my NIPT performed when I go in next week, and then I’m already scheduled for my NT in early December. 

I keep forgetting to get my flu shot but I️ am determined to go do it today after Preschool drop off. I wish they just did them at my midwife’s office so everything wasn’t it’s own stop. Oh well.

Oh also my midwife confirmed again that their best evidence showed some cord congestion— basically a cord accident. This wasn’t news to us, but is kind of another thing to be anxious about because I really can’t control that. I am on a baby aspirin this time, which the midwife said to continue through the entire pregnancy— just in case it can help keep things flowing.

So, we’ll see how MFM wants to schedule me out, but if I can get in at least one office every two weeks I think I’ll be comfortable with that, especially if I can have an open door policy for when my anxiety just gets stretched to its limit.</p>

<p>I should have my NIPT performed when I go in next week, and then I’m already scheduled for my NT in early December. </p>

<p>I keep forgetting to get my flu shot but I️ am determined to go do it today after Preschool drop off. I wish they just did them at my midwife’s office so everything wasn’t it’s own stop. Oh well.</p>

<p>Oh also my midwife confirmed again that their best evidence showed some cord congestion— basically a cord accident. This wasn’t news to us, but is kind of another thing to be anxious about because I really can’t control that. I am on a baby aspirin this time, which the midwife said to continue through the entire pregnancy— just in case it can help keep things flowing. </p>

<p>Also, the baby looks like a gummy bear this week. Adorable. </p>

Told my (25-year-old autistic) brother about the pregnancy last night. He’s excited and definitely wants to visit again before the baby is born “so [he] doesn’t have to be around a crying baby” and so he can see snow. (We’re from NC and I live in Maine, and he’s never seen real winter.)

He asked if I’d told our grandma. He’s really close with her, but she was nasty to me after my last two losses, so I haven’t wanted to say anything to her. He offered to keep it a secret, but I told him it was up to him. I really hope he tells her and lets her get whatever out of her system before I have to deal with it.

My NT and blood tests are Tuesday. I’m a little nervous that the results will be termination-level bad. The last thing I want to do is to go through another termination, since I had such a bad experience with D&C’s this summer.

And more cat drama: we had to put one of our two guys down last month after a battle with lymphoma, and our remaining guy broke a tooth running into the concrete back stairs a couple days ago. It was pretty bad. My husband just dropped him off at the vet a few minutes ago to get it extracted.

But it’s almost a 3-day weekend, so yay for that. I’m gonna help my friend work on her truck and then sit around in my maternity sweat pants and knit and read and not do any school work (grades were due and we had parent teacher conferences yesterday, so I’m burnt the fuck out).",[],,t1_dpkiy18,False,0,[],False,"<div class=""md""><p>Sorry in advance for the length...</p>

Unfortunately this post won't be able to stay here because it breaks this subs rules about posting on the main page about pregnancy. I will answer now though before it's taken down/removed. 


The hard thing is right now that you won't have an answer until your get your second blood drawn. 1 HCG draw alone is not a great indicator of a viable pregnancy because everybody's 'negative' level is different, between 1 and 5, so if you are one of the people who start at 1 you'll way lower at this point than someone who starts at 5. Date of implantation also causes variance in where you HCG level will be. Light bleeding and spotting is not at all uncommon in early pregnancy.  It is a 'threatened miscarriage', but many women go on to have successfully pregnancies after having early bleeding. What matters right now is waiting for your HCG doubling time, it should be around 48 hours. If it is you're not nearly as likely to miscarry. Honestly since you're not bleeding now and you only had one day of bleeding I don't know why you'd expect to your HCG to go down. Until then, you can get the same brand of test you had before and take it again and see if the line is darker. I had bleeding on and off during my second pregnancy from week 5-8 which would be anything from spotting to light bleeding and I made it through that without miscarrying. I wish you the best and hope this pregnancy continues. 


As for trying again you shouldn't have any issues trying right away unless you ultimately need surgery, but usually this early waiting for everything to carry out naturally. I think youre getting a little ahead of yourself though. ",[],,t1_dpkfba7,False,0,[],False,"<div class=""md""><p>Hi, so first I&#39;d like to say I&#39;m sorry you&#39;re in limbo. </p>

<li>Screamed &quot;fuck&quot; about 89 times into a pillow when he was in the other room.</li>
<li>Played a MOBA and yelled angrily at the other players with my microphone muted so they didn&#39;t actually hear me. </li>

<p>I&#39;m not terribly religious (Jewish intermarried with super-lazy Protestants), but so far my understanding of God has been Epicurean, which is roughly: &quot;There probably aren&#39;t any gods, and if there are, they are way too busy to care about your shit one way or the other. So try to avoid pain because holy fuck is there a lot of it in life!&quot; Which makes sense to me, because if there IS a God that&#39;s supposed to care about this shit, he or she is totally falling asleep on the job. </p>

She came over to me at my desk, squatted down next to my chair, put her hand on my shoulder, looked me on the eyes, and said with genuine empathy ""I was so sorry to hear that you lost your baby.

It was a planned c-section. I was mostly nervous about the spinal - I've had problems getting non-general anesthesia to ""take"" before, and the idea of having something shot directly into my spine was super freaky, to be honest. But it wasn't as bad as I feared. All I felt was the doctor tugging and a constant tingle everywhere else (a lot like my lower 3/4s had just fallen asleep). They gave me a clear drape so I could theoretically see what was happening, but my head was so low I still didn't see much. My husband sat behind my head and took about a billion pictures on my phone so I ""saw"" the entire thing once we were in the recovery room. Baby boy started screaming at the top of his lungs pretty much as soon as he hit air, which made me tear up long before I could see him. He was strong and healthy and, most importantly, alive!

We struggled to breastfed at first. He didn't really care about eating and spent several seasons refusing to even open his mouth. It seemed like each medical professional and lactation consultant who stopped by had a different explanation for why, but no good solutions. Finally around noon yesterday, he suddenly started getting it - which then promptly kicked off several hours of fussiness our nurse called ""the dreaded second day curse"".

<p>It was a planned c-section. I was mostly nervous about the spinal - I&#39;ve had problems getting non-general anesthesia to &quot;take&quot; before, and the idea of having something shot directly into my spine was super freaky, to be honest. But it wasn&#39;t as bad as I feared. All I felt was the doctor tugging and a constant tingle everywhere else (a lot like my lower 3/4s had just fallen asleep). They gave me a clear drape so I could theoretically see what was happening, but my head was so low I still didn&#39;t see much. My husband sat behind my head and took about a billion pictures on my phone so I &quot;saw&quot; the entire thing once we were in the recovery room. Baby boy started screaming at the top of his lungs pretty much as soon as he hit air, which made me tear up long before I could see him. He was strong and healthy and, most importantly, alive!</p>

<p>We struggled to breastfed at first. He didn&#39;t really care about eating and spent several seasons refusing to even open his mouth. It seemed like each medical professional and lactation consultant who stopped by had a different explanation for why, but no good solutions. Finally around noon yesterday, he suddenly started getting it - which then promptly kicked off several hours of fussiness our nurse called &quot;the dreaded second day curse&quot;. It&#39;s not a perfected system yet, but somehow with all that he&#39;s only lost 8 ounces so far, which isn&#39;t too bad considering he was born at 7 pounds, 8 ounces and hopefully the weight loss will start slowing down now that we&#39;re eating better. </p>

My biggest tips are to start MUCH LOWER than you think. 

As for how to do it, put the wand in one spot and push a bit...then kind of move the handle around in a circular motion, without moving the part the touches your belly - like a joystick. SLOWLY. If you don't hear it there, pick it up and move it a tiny bit and try that same motion again. 

Good luck! I think the Doppler can be great, but can also cause concern. And yes, unfortunately you likely won't be anxiety free until a baby is home safely with you. That's hard as shit. :(
