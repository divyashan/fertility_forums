My MIL seems to have decided that she's sick of the low turnout to her family gatherings because my husband and I haven't been going if my BIL & SIL go. So she didn't tell us they were coming to a 4th of July BBQ.

So my husband and I were sitting there quietly chatting with my husband's grandparents when suddenly my BIL&SIL rock up in their car - more importantly, with their toddler and the baby they had who should have a cousin born 1 day after him.

This is the baby they recently tried to pick up by one arm and shove into my arms because I'm ""the baby whisperer"" and he was crying (which made me turn around with some very upsetting words in return). 

But wait. There's more. So my BIL has invited his buddy (and buddy brought his daughter too). The daughter and my step-niece-i-guess are totally best buddies, even though my step-niece is only like 11 or 13, and her friend is like 15. 

Well it turns out this 15 year old girl is now pregnant too. And my step-niece thinks this is like the best thing EVER! So she's bringing it up in EVERY SENTENCE. ""oh I gave up my seat for <friend> coz she's pregnant."" ""do you think she's gonna have a boy or a girl? I think a boy and he'll be best friends with <newborn nephew> coz they'll be the same age"" and my favourite ""I think I'm going to get pregnant at 15 too"". 

So I'm now sitting in my car bawling my eyes out at a speedway and eating my weight in peanut M&Ms and am about to smoke a whole lot of pot (which I anticipated wanting on the drive home because of my nephew, but didn't bring nearly enough for this) and walk back in there and try to grin and bear my way through it.

My older sister lost her first child, a son called Marcus, at 23 weeks 5 days too, in February 2010. I hope it makes you glad for her that we, as a family, rallied around her.

My mother experienced multiple second trimester losses so you think she would get it, but even with that it just dissolved her into a mess because I'm not sure she ever grieved properly for any of them. On the other hand I'm not convinced my MIL understands that I had to deliver my dead baby, like she knows I did but I don't think she has the capacity to process that he was a tiny human that was my son (i.e. Acting more like a first trimester loss where I lost the abstract idea of a child and not the baby boy that like to head butt my bladder)

It's hard and this sucks. We've been dealt a really shitty hand. Make sure you have someone to talk to and someone that will hold you or shake you when you need it. I honestly had to have my husband tell me that I was depressed, I didn't notice how bad I had become. 

Grieve. You lost your baby so be gentle on yourself. I don't think I understood what feeling empty meant until I lost William. You just lost a part of yourself, a buddy that had kept you company for the past couple of months and that was going to be a major part of you going forward. It's raw right now but the best thing that I did for myself was stop dwelling on what the future should have been. I'm not saying move past everything right now but at some point I had to start moving forward and acknowledge that this is my new story and embrace it. My husband had to remind me that sometimes you have to put in effort to be happy, I feel like that's a good thing to remember.

You are not alone, please message me whenever, I'm only 8 weeks out but at this point I'm physically healed and emotionally I'm coping. Talk to your doctors and have a plan for the future, I know that it's very soon right now but I know that having some kind of plan made me feel better even when I wasn't sure if we would ever try again.

Now she waits on me to bring something up, but I think that's more my fault than it is hers. She contacts me to make plans with each other and she tries NOT to bring her baby along.

It's like we have been cursed and thrown into this deep, dark hole that is now called life and there's no way out. I know exactly how you feel. 

I can say that this is totally normal, you just lost Max less than six months ago so his death is still very recent. Whenever something horrible and traumatic like this happens it does overshadow everything. It takes time for you to find the enjoyment in life again. Sometimes I try to stubbornly shift my mindset back to things I'm grateful for. I make myself think of how I'm more fortunate than others in certain areas of my life (not all of them): my husband, family, etc., things that you mentioned above. I think of people who don't have roofs over their heads and are struggling in wars, refugees, people who have lost multiple children in conflicts. 

There's three thought processes that helped me a lot....the commonality of suffering, the realization that life is never going to be perfect, and knowing that you can be happy and sad at the same time. Everybody is suffering in their own way. Yes, some lucky assholes are suffering less than us right now, but in the entirety of their lives they WILL have something very difficult to deal with. When my son's death was more recent I couldn't even think about this because I thought ""no way, the suffering of losing your child is the ultimate pain and nothing can surpass that."" But I'm trying to open my mind to think of others who are in pain to know we aren't alone....and that there are 3 million stillborn babies yearly in the world. The other thing, life is always going to have some type of suffering and imperfection. We will never 100% be fully happy with our surroundings and that is okay. A lot of society's messages are that we have to have the perfect house, job, family, cars, and pets, in order to be satisfied. That simply isn't true. Many people don't have all of these things, some will never get these things, others DO have all of these things and they are still miserable, still wrestling with discontent and trying to attain the next level of what they think will make them happy. 

The last thing, sometimes I catch myself thinking that life is good, and I also think ""but I lost my son."" It can be both. It's hard to see this, it takes a lot of time to pass, but it's possible. You can miss your son and appreciate the rest of life all at the same time, I am grieving, but I also have happy relaxed moments with my husband and friends.

Instead, one of my cousins gave birth in March and another is due next month. I couldn't get too close to the situation. Everyone on my Facebook feed is announcing pregnancies and popping out babies. One girl announced her pregnancy at 6w3d and she is having twins. 

Seriously, it sucks when everyone is where you want to be. They have what you don't (YET). They are further along.  Try to distance yourself from others that are spouting that joy. It's really hard to be happy when the joy is not yours. But- then again- you are going to be an AUNT. That is so exciting!!

So- happy ending that will hopefully offer up some positivity. 

After my Dec 3 miscarriage, I tried every month to get pregnant again. I'm a lesbian and would fly 1000 miles to our donor to try every time. It took 6 months. We found out we were pregnant again at 3.5 weeks and I bawled my eyes out. I refused to believe it since I expected it would be a chemical pregnancy or I would lose it like the former pregnancy. It's still not real, but the boobs, nausea, and pregnancy tests say otherwise. 

So- mourn your loss. Never forget the baby you lost. Love that baby and the memory of what might have been. 

You can get pregnant and once your hormones are back in the swing of things, you will get pregnant again and then you can benefit from the hand-me-downs from your sisters' kids.  You'll get the pleasure of being an auntie first and mommy soon after. 

It will happen, and whilst the need for patience is truly torture, I can attest to the reward one receives when trusting (even reluctantly) in that time.

<p>Ps: want to add that I had to sit next to a pregnant woman on the subway ride home from the session, and even though I didn&#39;t necessarily like it, it didn&#39;t send me into a panicked rage. I would have immediately changed seats and started to freak out before the acupuncture. </p>

The first time I tried to get pregnant, my cycles were weird trying to come off the pill, I was super confused about what was happening, and stressed that it would never work out.

I was really crushed, because we were trying and no one knew, and hearing two people share good news when I was hoping to have some of my own was hard. The next day I got a positive pregnancy test. The day after that I started bleeding.

I had another CP a the following month but after that fell pregnant with my 2.5 year old.

It was really really helpful to have a safe space to talk about all these feelings and gain some useful tools for helping me to cope and function in a society where all I saw was pregnant bellies. (For what it's worth I am also seeing a therapist now after my stillbirth, and it is just as helpful now as it was then, even though the magnitude of the losses is so different.) 

I also saw an RE after the second CP, because my gut told me something was wrong. He fixed me right up, but even more than that he validated that my chemical pregnancies were losses and were worth looking into, even when so many doctors treat them as just ""nature taking its course"" or a falsely positive pregnancy test. That particular step does not apply to everyone, of course, but after the second loss I knew I needed to be proactive for my own sanity.

Went to the ER expecting a miscarriage and wanted to rule out ectopic (I had some right sided cramping that resolved on it&#39;s own on Monday). Found a heartbeat and fetus measuring 6+4, only one day shy of my calculations. Calling the OB as soon as they open for the next steps, but the bleeding stopped within a few hours.</p>

<p>Edit: heard back from OB. They want to see me at my regular appointment on Wednesday if nothing else goes wrong. I think that&#39;s a good plan, that way we can see if cupcake is growing or not viable. I&#39;m nervous and anxious, but we will see how the next few days go.</p>

To recap for those who don't know/remember me...I had a normal, uneventful pregnancy in 2012 that resulted in my 4-year-old daughter. I had a MMC at 13weeks in July of 2015. Another one in January 2016. And a third in May 2016. At that point, I took 2+ months off work to cope, research, heal, do the full fertility workup and all that. Doctors and specialists found no cause for the miscarriages.


Last October I found I was pregnant again. I started applying for a few different jobs for something with less stress and to get a new perspective on things. I got married in December; on my wedding day I received an interview call. By the second week in January, I had a new job, a new last name, and the results of an amnio and microarray that showed a healthy baby girl. 


And then I got horribly superstitious. I read this subreddit every single day but was afraid to post ANYTHING. So I apologize for not chronicling this pregnancy. 


I'm holding my 11-day old baby girl, who was born after induction at 41 weeks with a largely uneventful birth. I had early labor starting at 33 weeks, but thanks to meds and resting was able to keep her in longer. This time around nursing is actually working (yes!) and I'm so thankful and grateful. 


I had truly given up hope after miscarriage #3. I was going to try one more time and then re-evaluate whether to even have another kid. I had tossed all kinds of baby stuff out of despair and anger. I started antidepressants (which I'm still on, since I had PPD after my first pregnancy). I read every single thing I could. 


I don't know if anything truly made a difference--all the doctors could guess at was that I had ""old eggs."" I bought ubiquinol and a few other supplements and started taking them 90 days prior to conceiving, cut out most alcohol and did the Whole30 for two months before/while conceiving. My husband also abstained from alcohol for the same period of time. Also did acupuncture to heal from third miscarriage and prep for conception. Had an HSG test which showed nothing but definitely ""flushed"" out my uterus since I bled for 10 days afterwards (had the previous embryos tried to implant on old tissue? I don't know...)


Did any/all of it work? I don't know, but nothing hurt to try. Anyway, just wanted to say hi, say I'm following everybody's stories, and to give some hope to those still trying. ",[],,t1_djj9ggo,False,0,[],False,"<div class=""md""><p>Hi Everyone...long time, no post. </p>

<p>To recap for those who don&#39;t know/remember me...I had a normal, uneventful pregnancy in 2012 that resulted in my 4-year-old daughter. I had a MMC at 13weeks in July of 2015.

I was feeling really uncomfortable in my pregnant body because I didn't want to be showing so much not being sure it would last. And I had symptoms, especially morning sickness, all the way until they put me under yesterday afternoon. It was cruel.

Today I look less pregnant and haven't felt nauseated at all. That's already really great, and I'm looking forward to feeling more and more back to normal.

We're waiting for results of genetic testing on the pregnancy, and I may go to an RE for a consult about my fibroids. They're on the outside of my uterus, but one of them is big enough to see through my tummy now (it's about 11cm), so they think blood supply may be an issue.

So now we wait! I may have to have surgery to remove my fibroids before we try again. Depending on what else they find, we may not try again at all. I thought the idea of ""giving up"" would make me sad, but it actually sounds kind of nice right now.

Oddly enough, I'm feeling better and more optimistic now that the pregnancy is over than I ever felt being pregnant this last time.

One thing to keep in mind, is that although it may not be necessary to wait 2-3 cycles, you definitely should wait for one complete cycle.

As far as other questions, it's important to ask whatever you need to for your peace of mind, but they won't be able to tell you much. In three years of TTC I have had two MMCs and a CP, and all are still unexplained (and now unexplained infertility, too). An OB in particular will not be able to help much, if you were to have another loss or take 12+ months to conceive, definitely see an RE to do recurrent loss testing. This is the testing that assesses things like autoimmune and blood clotting factors (baby aspirin can help if you happen to test positive, but most people won't). The most likely scenario is that a chromosomal abnormality arose in the egg or in the early divisions of the embryo, but this can only be confirmed through genetic testing of the products of conception, which would be tough at 6 weeks. 

Otherwise, I am intimately familiar with the urge to understand what happened and how to exert control over it happening again. It did happen again to me, but I am not among a majority.

You have to be careful with counting iron like that because iron is very difficult for body to absorb and different sources of iron have different absorption rates; and slow vs quick release. So 60mg of one brand of iron supplements does not equal 60mg of another brand, etc. This particular brand uses the type of iron that absorbs easier than other iron supplements (if you google the name you'll find at least one study that confirmed this.)

This says that for most iron supplements absorption rates are 10%-15%, that means out of that 60mg pill your body only gets 6-9mg. This also cites a study that showed that higher doses of iron vs lower doses didn't have significant differences in improving the overall blood iron levels (the doses were: 15mg, 50mg, or 150mg). Lots of interesting info there.

I lost William at 21 weeks exactly when I went into labor and my water broke. It is so profoundly heartbreaking to deliver a silent baby.

I was in such a low place that I didn't know what to do with myself, barely moved off the couch while I was home unless I was in bed. I've started to swing around and feel hopeful again. Hubs and I aren't actively trying but we aren't stopping anything at this point either ( William was so planned it's almost painful I know exactly which night I got pregnant and peeing on a pregnancy test was just to confirm what I already knew).

Honestly having this little bit of hope is helping my mood. I'm able to start thinking about a different future.

I was in such a low place that I didn&#39;t know what to do with myself, barely moved off the couch while I was home unless I was in bed. I&#39;ve started to swing around and feel hopeful again. Hubs and I aren&#39;t actively trying but we aren&#39;t stopping anything at this point either ( William was so planned it&#39;s almost painful I know exactly which night I got pregnant and peeing on a pregnancy test was just to confirm what I already knew).</p>

<p>Honestly having this little bit of hope is helping my mood. I&#39;m able to start thinking about a different future. I was so hung up on what was and what was going to be that I stopped thinking about the now and what can be. Don&#39;t feel bad about holding on to hope, you have to do whatever you can to pull yourself up.</p>

We had a stillbirth on May 12 at 39 weeks-- went into the hospital laboring, not realizing anything at all was wrong, and when they tried to find the heartbeat, it just wasn't there. 

My first question, after hysterically asking the doctor who did the ultrasound what had happened (no one knows) was to ask my midwife when I could try again. Every decision we made that day, from whether to have a VBAC or a csection, to what to name our son, was made in an effort to preserve our options to continue to build our family as soon as we possibly can. So no, you are not crazy and you are not alone in your desire to get pregnant. It is truly all I think about sometimes. I know what you mean though-- it feels crazy to want this after such a devastating, horrible thing that happened to you. After we left the hospital, I was afraid to even admit it to anyone, because it seems so insane to me. We met our therapist for the second time before I admitted it to her. She assured me that it was totally normal, and for most people, it is their first question when they start processing their stillbirth (she specializes in infant loss). When you have reordered your entire life to prepare for a baby, and then you don't have that baby with you, your body and your mind want the thing they prepared for and did not get. It gave me such peace to know this was normal.

This doesn't mean it isn't hard though-- some days I think the desperation to be pregnant and the fear that getting pregnant will be a struggle are even harder to grapple with than the grief of losing my very wanted baby. My midwife told me we could begin trying after my first period, which showed up on Friday. (Six weeks to the day.) She seemed much more concerned with whether my mental health would be solid enough to navigate another pregnancy. I decided that I could wait 100 years and still have every single anxiety during a subsequent pregnancy, so why wait. My therapist says you can be both grieving and pregnant simultaneously. My midwife agreed with that and will work with me on managing stress and anxiety during a subsequent pregnancy. She seemed fairly certain I'd need anxiety medication, which, to be fair, is probably true. I imagine if and when I become pregnant, she, my therapist, my husband, and I will all work together closely to make sure we aren't overwhelmed and come up with a plan to address any issues.

I'm crawling out from the reddit shadows (I've been a successful lurker for years) to say hi to you all and to hopefully lean on your expertise. Not sure if TWs are needed in this sub, but I mention my miscarriage below. 

My husband and I started trying for a baby last year using Clue and fell pregnant around December/January. We ended up with a MMC in April/May at what would have been 18 weeks. Our little girl had stopped growing around 14 weeks. 

I had a D&C and was told we could try again after one cycle. In the same follow-up appointment, I was told that the lab had LOST her so they hadn't run any labs to determine what had gone wrong. I'm normally a super steady and calm person, but this sent me to a really bad place. How could they have ""misplaced"" something that was so precious to me? I don't think I've ever been as simultaneously stunned, sad and mad as I was that day. It's something that can still bring to to tears. The doctor was able to track her down (tucked in the back of a freezer--imagery that he could've left out for my mental well being) and we were finally able to get closure.

I read Sheryl Sandburg's new book about loss and found it to be very healing. It taught me a lot about being aware of the little joys and gratitudes in life. My husband and I started trying to come up with things each day that brought us joy. It helped me to come out of my fog. One of my biggest gratitudes was that we were able to determine the reason for the loss. I know that a lot of people aren't as fortunate and we came very close to that point (due to hospital fuck-uppary). 

After waiting one cycle, I decided to try FF, temping and OPKs based off the recommendations from this group (again, A+ lurker). My goal was to use these tools to confirm that I'm back to normal. Well, turns out that they just made me more confused! 

I'm hoping that one of you can take a look at my chart and help me understand what I'm even looking at... (https://www.fertilityfriend.com/home/6b26cb). FF is telling me that no ovulation has been detected but this looks like a temp rise to me? I went in to this cycle feeling ready to go, but as each day without a period passes and with continuous BFNs and uncertainty about if I've even ovulated, my optimism is flying out the window. Prior to my MC, my cycles were regular at 27 +/-2 days. Typing this out feels so silly because I know that none of you have a psychic connection with my uterus (if you do, please clue me in!) and that my period will eventually come hell or high water (hopefully in the next day or so). 

Sorry for the essay. Just wanted to say hello, share my story and my ignorance. You guys have been so wonderful to learn from on the sidelines.

I had my procedure in the UK but also at a planned parenthood type place as the NHS do not offer surgical after a certain time and I was past that and desperate not to have to give birth.

The procedure itself was the easiest part. There was lots of waiting in the morning. I was taken for some dialation rods to be inserted around 11:30 and found that very painful. Honestly that's really unusual and my surgeon commented as such.
I had mild cramps for the next few hours - take a hot water bottle/ heat pad with you maybe as that would have helped me.
I was called down to surgery around 2:45. I was terrified of the GA but they were so kind and reassuring and I was asleep instantly. The next thing awake in recovery. 20 minutes later. Felt really surreal and bizarre and a little high honestly. 
I was discharged two hours later after I'd gone to the toilet and physically the recovery was fine. A little bleeding and that's it. I had some pain and a suspected infection a week or so later but that was dealt with with some antibiotics and they also said it could have been delayed bleeding - I did bleed again shortly afterwards. And again a week later. Sort of sporadic but I think it's all done now.
 Emotionally is obviously a different story but I'm getting there.
Be kind to yourself and make sure you rest. I was wiped out after the procedure and had to take myself to bed really early and was a bit zonked the next day too.
You will be ok and you will get there. I wish it didn't have to be this way for any of us. My heart breaks for you.

Unfortunately, even if your dates were somehow magically wrong (and I believe you know them), HCG that high without anything in your uterus is not a good sign. There is pretty much no way it was twins and one vanished - with 11k hcg you'd see something. 

Also unfortunate, the odds this is ectopic are high at this point. It's something to take into serious consideration and be discussing with your doctor. Urgently. You do not need to have pain for it to be ectopic. And with hcg as high as yours, something is likely growing *somewhere*. 

I hope you get more answers soon. BUT, consider asking your doctor about Methotrexate. I am not sure why you'd go straight to surgery without trying that. 

Best of luck. We're here for you!

My period was weird and practically nonexistent yesterday, but AF really showed up to party today, removing all doubt that that's what's going on. Hubs and I went to Six Flags today with some neighbors who moved in a few months ago and we are kind of awkwardly trying to friend-date. It was a much needed day of actual fun, which we just haven't had since our son died. We got to get out of our heads a little bit and ride on a ton of roller coasters because, why not? It's not like I'm pregnant. 

In the moments where I wasn't distracted by the heat or the funnel cake or the rides, though, I was mentally plotting out what a pregnancy looks like if I conceive this cycle. Since our son was stillborn, I've been desperate to be pregnant. But I've been obsessing over logistical things like whether we will even tell anyone and when we would share the information to those who we felt were on a need-to-know basis-- family, close friends, etc. I think the option I keep returning to is that we would try to keep it as under wraps as possible until the anatomy scan, at least. With Sam, we didn't feel comfortable sharing our news more publicly until then, but we had told our families and close friends. I feel pretty confident that I won't be making a Facebook announcement anytime in the future for any child ever, and I'd really prefer for most people to not know prior to the birth. If I were to conceive this cycle, we'd have an anatomy scan in the first half of November. We'd be able to tell family before the holidays, if we decided to do that. That really struck a chord with me, since we feel so tentative already about how to share happy news in the future after having to deliver the saddest news ever. We've decided not to tell many people we are trying-- partly because it's just kind of awkward and personal anyways, and partly because we would expect some judgement for jumping back into it so soon, which isn't really anybody's business anyways. I just figure that even if I conceived right away, in 10 months no one will be doing the math but in three months, they probably will. 

I don't know if any of that makes sense. I'm really tired and fried from the sun.

TL;DR: I'm on CD2. I want to be pregnant. I hope it happens this cycle. Navigating life in the wake of a stillbirth is an emotional landmine. I'm sunburned. 

Also, can someone give me a hint as to how to add that little bit of info about myself by my username so you all can see my history every time I post?

My period was weird and practically nonexistent yesterday, but AF really showed up to party today, removing all doubt that that&#39;s what&#39;s going on. Hubs and I went to Six Flags today with some neighbors who moved in a few months ago and we are kind of awkwardly trying to friend-date. It was a much needed day of actual fun, which we just haven&#39;t had since our son died. We got to get out of our heads a little bit and ride on a ton of roller coasters because, why not? It&#39;s not like I&#39;m pregnant. </p>

<p>In the moments where I wasn&#39;t distracted by the heat or the funnel cake or the rides, though, I was mentally plotting out what a pregnancy looks like if I conceive this cycle. Since our son was stillborn, I&#39;ve been desperate to be pregnant. But I&#39;ve been obsessing over logistical things like whether we will even tell anyone and when we would share the information to those who we felt were on a need-to-know basis-- family, close friends, etc. I think the option I keep returning to is that we would try to keep it as under wraps as possible until the anatomy scan, at least. With Sam, we didn&#39;t feel comfortable sharing our news more publicly until then, but we had told our families and close friends. I feel pretty confident that I won&#39;t be making a Facebook announcement anytime in the future for any child ever, and I&#39;d really prefer for most people to not know prior to the birth. If I were to conceive this cycle, we&#39;d have an anatomy scan in the first half of November. We&#39;d be able to tell family before the holidays, if we decided to do that. That really struck a chord with me, since we feel so tentative already about how to share happy news in the future after having to deliver the saddest news ever.

I gained about 30 lbs when I was pregnant with Riyad and I knew when I had him I would work hard to lose the weight. Now he&#39;s gone and I don&#39;t have motivation to lose anything. I did naturally lose some weight, but I&#39;m too pissed to even look at the scale because it will send me into anger and depression!</p>

<p>Your weight sounds pretty good to me. Since it doesn&#39;t pose any risks and you are a healthy BMI, I would say not to worry about conceiving. It won&#39;t affect anything for you and, hopefully when you have another healthy baby, you will have your hands full and feel motivated to get the weight off :) I bet you still look good, it&#39;s just shitty that we have to start again after we have our mommy weight and postpartum bodies. Like we lost our babies, now we have to lose confidence in ourselves? Take care of yourself and know you still look good, we don&#39;t need to have additional stress on ourselves 💕❤️</p>

I think the book is Babywise... but I'll double check. 

Basically you let them cry for like 1 minute, then two, then I think 5, then keep it at every five minutes, but you stop talking to them. Just give them their binky, fix their nightlight, whatever, to let them know you still exist, then leave again.

It's a lot of work at first but the babies pick up on it quickly that they get no attention after the five minutes. It never lets them feel completely abandoned, but it does teach them to self soothe.

BabyWise also details the baby sleep-wake cycle, which is usually 40 minutes. If you track sleep you'll start to notice that they do wake up in increments of 40. They'll also generally be awake in increments of 40. So if you can time it to get them down at the beginning of that cycle, they'll sleep for the full 40 minutes, or maybe 80 or 120 minutes. It also talks about the importance of eat-play-sleep and not letting them feed to fall asleep. It's tricky and sometimes impossible if your breastfeed, but it was also handy knowledge. 

Anyway, sorry if you already know all this. I just love to tell people who are sort of undecided on CIO, because it's a good compromise on sleep training. 

Btw I ever even bought the book, I just looked up Baby Wise and maybe Sleep Wise on google. 

Also google the fourth trimester if you haven't yet. Basically you do minimal training of any kind the first 3-4 months. Just cater to their needs to they feel totally comfortable and secure. Most babies don't sleep train well until 4 months anyway.

Husband and I spent the late afternoon and evening with friends who have two kids (5 and 2) yesterday. All in all, it was nice talking to someone about kids and playing boardgames was fun. 

But seriously, I could live without the subtle comments about how ""little"" maternity leave I am taking. Little in this case means that I am taking leave for 8 months (!), then returning to work part time for 4 and then going back to full-time. Yes, that's what Germans call ""little"". Because I am not doing what over 90 percent are doing, which is taking a year off and then working part-time for another one or two years while the kid is spending 6 hours a day in daycare. 

The real killer? During those 4 months of me working part-time (25 hours) and for the **whole year** afterwards, until the kid is 2, the husband will be working part-time (25 or 30 hours). He's very flexible with when he works so little one won't even need to be in full-time daycare until he's two or so. 

""But what if baby doesn't want to be left with daddy?"" Wtf? If that happens at 8 months, we have bigger problems, guys. That certainly won't be the first time he'll be with his dad for half a day. And do people not get how insulting that whole line of thought is? Like I am the only adequate caregiver for the baby because I am the mom and my husband is inadequate or something? Like if I care even a bit about my career/job and husband cares about being with his kid (it's really not like he's being forced into this arrangement!) things are somehow wrong? And if we care about having money come in we are somehow not taking care of our kid? 

I know that it's not ""usual"" in Germany to have both parents make basically the same amount of money, but seriously, we aren't even splitting parental leave down in the middle and still people are completely stumped.

I was 39 weeks so I was not expecting my period to arrive on the early end of the ""normal"" postpartum time frame, but I woke up this morning to some fresh red blood on my toilet paper. My midwife told us if we felt emotionally ready we could begin trying again after my first period. I don't really know what ""emotionally ready"" looks like after a loss so cruel, but we have agreed that the most healing thing for us would be to take active steps to continue to try growing our family, so I was actually happy to see my period this morning because it means the end of the passive waiting period.

The bummer of it all is that my husband is due to be out of town on a can't-miss work trip when I think I would ovulate, based on past cycles. There's a possibility I could join him, which we are considering,  even though it will be a little bit of a pain with our toddler. (She is a very difficult traveler, and we'd be gone about a week. If her needs weren't a factor, I would have already booked my trip.) What would you ladies do? I'm pretty sure that even if the chances of conceiving so early are slim as my hormones get back in order, I'd regret not even taking the opportunity to try. We've gotten pregnant every cycle we have ever tried-- I had 2 chemical pregnancies before conceiving my daughter and then we conceived my son on the first try. My endocrinologist (who follows my thyroid so we can avoid more chemical pregnancies) suggested there was good reason to believe that getting pregnant quickly could be my expectation moving forward, given my past history with TTC. I know that's just her opinion and no guarantee, but it gave me a lot of hope. I keep joking that I come from a good Irish catholic family so Irish twins should just be a birthright for me. 

Also relevant: I had a D&C after delivery to removed some retained placental tissue. I was told this could mean a lighter period this cycle because it would have removed a good deal of the uterine lining. So far this seems accurate-- the red blood lasted a very short time this morning before diminishing to brown spotting. Now it seems the red blood is kind of coming and going rather than flowing, but maybe that's just because it's CD1-- historically my period has started off slower and then picked up on day 2 before tapering off again. But the flow is inconsistent enough that a while ago I was actually questioning whether I had really gotten my period. 

Any thoughts? Any experience from anyone else who has had a D&C? Anyone else who's had to deliver an 8 lb baby and then decided to have sex again like right after hitting the 6 week mark? (Haha I waited way longer than this with my daughter and she was a csection baby, so my vag hadn't even been traumatized.)",[],,t1_djbbm07,False,0,[],False,"<div class=""md""><p>I&#39;m 6 weeks postpartum today after delivering our stillborn baby. I was 39 weeks so I was not expecting my period to arrive on the early end of the &quot;normal&quot; postpartum time frame, but I woke up this morning to some fresh red blood on my toilet paper. My midwife told us if we felt emotionally ready we could begin trying again after my first period. I don&#39;t really know what &quot;emotionally ready&quot; looks like after a loss so cruel, but we have agreed that the most healing thing for us would be to take active steps to continue to try growing our family, so I was actually happy to see my period this morning because it means the end of the passive waiting period.</p>

<p>The bummer of it all is that my husband is due to be out of town on a can&#39;t-miss work trip when I think I would ovulate, based on past cycles. There&#39;s a possibility I could join him, which we are considering,  even though it will be a little bit of a pain with our toddler. (She is a very difficult traveler, and we&#39;d be gone about a week. If her needs weren&#39;t a factor, I would have already booked my trip.) What would you ladies do? I&#39;m pretty sure that even if the chances of conceiving so early are slim as my hormones get back in order, I&#39;d regret not even taking the opportunity to try. We&#39;ve gotten pregnant every cycle we have ever tried-- I had 2 chemical pregnancies before conceiving my daughter and then we conceived my son on the first try. My endocrinologist (who follows my thyroid so we can avoid more chemical pregnancies) suggested there was good reason to believe that getting pregnant quickly could be my expectation moving forward, given my past history with TTC. I know that&#39;s just her opinion and no guarantee, but it gave me a lot of hope. I keep joking that I come from a good Irish catholic family so Irish twins should just be a birthright for me. </p>

<p>Also relevant: I had a D&amp;C after delivery to removed some retained placental tissue. I was told this could mean a lighter period this cycle because it would have removed a good deal of the uterine lining. So far this seems accurate-- the red blood lasted a very short time this morning before diminishing to brown spotting. Now it seems the red blood is kind of coming and going rather than flowing, but maybe that&#39;s just because it&#39;s CD1-- historically my period has started off slower and then picked up on day 2 before tapering off again. But the flow is inconsistent enough that a while ago I was actually questioning whether I had really gotten my period. </p>

Breastfeeding has been up and down, but we are working on it. We also found out she has a small hole in her heart, but apparently they are very common and usually fix themselves by 18 months. A cardiologist will be monitoring her. We are being discharged tomorrow morning.

Please keep in touch and let me know if you want to talk. If you stalk my post history you&#39;ll find very similar feelings from me just a few months ago. Crossing all the things that this is it for you! </p>

My baby was born Wednesday at 38+2. He is so precious, has dimples when he smiles, and just melts my heart ❤️. I had woken up at 1 am with BH, couldn't get back to sleep, and noticed the contractions were becoming stronger. I was in denial for a couple hours, convincing myself they would stop...they didn't. I started timing them on the app Full Term (I recommend it) and pretty soon they were painful and coming every 3-5 mins. Im so lucky the Dr on call was my favorite Dr in my practice! I was stoked. she did my first D&C, and we were both glad to see each other again under happier circumstances. So, Husband and I headed to the hospital for my c section. 

This next part probably qualifies as a worst case birth scenario, but I made peace with it. I was prepped for surgery and went to the OR, with pretty painful contractions by then and super ready to get my spinal block put in. The anesthesiologist put it in twice, and administered two types of meds, and unfortunately nothing worked completely. I still had feeling in my thighs/abdomen. The OR staff were surprised since this never happens. I was just one of those rare cases. After that, I agreed to go under general anesthesia. Frankly, I just wanted my baby, and there was no guarantee more spinal attempts were going to work. Because I was put under, my husband wasn't allowed in the OR, so neither of us were 'there' for the birth. 

The C section went fine, they were constantly updating my husband, and after checking baby's health they brought him to my husband in the recovery room, and eventually I was brought there too and I woke up to my husband introducing me to our son. It was actually really beautiful, and I didn't feel remorse about the situation. There is at least the fact that I didn't have to stare at a sheet for an hour and wonder if everything is going okay. The nurses took pictures and videos of the moments after the birth in the OR, so at least we have that. I got my golden hour, he nursed well, and I've been recovering quickly. 

Thank you to everyone in this sub for sharing your stories and being a great community. We've all experienced loss in different ways and I so appreciate that we don't compare ourselves,  but rather we focus on lifting each other up.

I've been really uncomfortable in my growing pregnant body because I was afraid of that. I hated being an obviously pregnant lady who might not be staying that way, and I've hated that my friends have been excited for me when I can't feel excited for myself or good about being pregnant. I knew my body would keep going whether the pregnancy was viable or not, so it's been difficult to be wondering whether anything was alive in there. I just assumed the worst most of the time, and I'm not sure now in the aftermath if that was better or healthy or helpful.

At least now that I'm to 3 losses in a row in 9 months, they'll do genetic tests on the fetus and  both of us. They may be sending me to an RE next. Has anyone had experience with an RE for recurrent miscarriage if you don't have issues conceiving? We're 3/3 on getting pregnant, so I'm not sure what to expect.

I'd done no research into PCOS beyond just understanding the basics of what it is and the symptoms and I'm not letting myself go down into the Google-hole.

My RE just called and said he'd prescribe metformin, and suggested attempting natural conception with the hope of a better quality egg and that implantation occurs on the uterine wall instead of the septum that he's still reluctant to operate on. If natural conception didn't occur within a few cycles, he suggested clomid would be an option; but if it did and there was another loss, he'd know all the obvious causes were ruled out and start looking closer at the septum. 

I'm... Less than thrilled with the news. I feel like it's just another loss waiting to happen because there are too many unresolved variables. He's sent off the prescription and is happy to ""just wait"" for the moment until I'm ready to try again.

At the moment, that's going to be a long wait. Just looking at my estimated ovulation dates, we'd be trying to hit an ovulation date that falls right on the anniversary of our last pregnancy's EDD and I just can't deal with so much anxiety and sadness at once.

I have no experience with the D&C, but I was 18w, though my loss was measuring 16w, and I was induced as they suggested it would be easier in terms of recovery. I think 16w was the cut off for my office to start with an induction versus going with a D&C. It was extremely boring. They inserted massive doses of Cervidil next to my cervix (ouch! Basically the nurse shoved a few Tylenol up there) every 4 hours, requiring me to stay mostly in bed for 12 hours. It took 3 doses to get the ball rolling. I got an epidural, and felt a little pressure, but no pain when my son was born. I think they said at my stage it was 50/50 whether I'd need additional procedures (though I think at this point it was a D&E) to remove any residual tissue, but I didn't need it. Also very short recovery time, on the span of hours. It might be something to consider, but I do understand the appeal of a D&C. 

At this stage, after birth, you can hold them if you want. I chose not to do this. The hospital might also offer things like a blanket they've been wrapped in, hand or feet prints, locks of hair, or photos. At this stage, we weren't able to obtain prints, because he was just too small. You can also ask the hospital to take care of burial (up until 20 weeks in my state) or set it up yourself. 

My milk also came in. I found it helpful in my recovery to pump for a while and donate the milk. If you don't have a pump, you can rent or borrow one from the hospital. You'd need to start pumping within a few hours after birth to build supply. You can save a little (around an ounce) and get a special breast milk memory item made. But as others have said, you can do various things to get it to go away if you'd prefer. 

I found projects to be a huge source of comfort for me. Pumping took up a lot of my time for the first month. Now it's various arts and crafts, and trying to get back to my normal activities like work and school. 

It gets better. I know it's hard to believe. I'm two months out, and have just been cleared for TTC, and have all my (negative) results back, which helped me a lot. Helped me feel like it wasn't my fault and that I could move on without guilt.

I finally got my clinic to care about my bleeding issues. I called on Tuesday and got a nurse who let me say everything I was worried about including: the yellow, light/dark brown, and dark red colors I was seeing in my underwear and left sided pain that hurts more with pressure.

This time the nurse spoke to a midwife who said she was worried the baby was in my tube, or that I might have an infection.

They had trouble finding a time to give me an ultrasound, and said the next opening would be the 28th. Luckily they really wanted to see me asap so I got to go in yesterday.

I didn't get to have an ultrasound or hear a heartbeat with my last MC, and it will always bother me. For this baby I had given up hope it was even alive, and was expecting the worse when they started the ultrasound. To my surprise, there was a little baby with a flickering heartbeat. I was so shocked and relieved. I just kept thinking wow the baby is okay, I was stressing over nothing. Later, the midwife took a swab, and it turns out I do have an infection. So she gave me a prescription to use and I hope everything will be normal after this.

It turns out that because my mc made my cycles   irregular I ovulated much later than I thought. So instead of being 7w5d I'm actually 7w. Which would explain why I didn't get a positive pregnancy test until CD32.

Sorry if it&#39;s kind of long. </p>

<p>I finally got my clinic to care about my bleeding issues. I called on Tuesday and got a nurse who let me say everything I was worried about including: the yellow, light/dark brown, and dark red colors I was seeing in my underwear and left sided pain that hurts more with pressure.</p>

<p>This time the nurse spoke to a midwife who said she was worried the baby was in my tube, or that I might have an infection.</p>

<p>They had trouble finding a time to give me an ultrasound, and said the next opening would be the 28th. Luckily they really wanted to see me asap so I got to go in yesterday.</p>

<p>I didn&#39;t get to have an ultrasound or hear a heartbeat with my last MC, and it will always bother me. For this baby I had given up hope it was even alive, and was expecting the worse when they started the ultrasound. To my surprise, there was a little baby with a flickering heartbeat. I was so shocked and relieved. I just kept thinking wow the baby is okay, I was stressing over nothing. Later, the midwife took a swab, and it turns out I do have an infection. So she gave me a prescription to use and I hope everything will be normal after this.</p>

<p>It turns out that because my mc made my cycles   irregular I ovulated much later than I thought. So instead of being 7w5d I&#39;m actually 7w. Which would explain why I didn&#39;t get a positive pregnancy test until CD32. </p>

Oddly enough, my appetite returned after I got the news yesterday. I&#39;m guessing I really couldn&#39;t eat because I was so stressed out thinking I was going lose this baby too.</p>

I mostly lurk here and occasionally pop into the daily ""trying"" thread, but I have a little issue and none of the other subs/threads where I post more regularly would be appropriate for this, so I hope you don't mind lending some advice! <3

I've had three CPs in a year-plus of trying (all just shy of 5 weeks), the most recent being last month. I get a very faint/unconvincing positive HPT the day after my period is due (after several days of obvious negatives), but then it's gone the next day and I get my period.

Today I'm 10dpo, and just took an HPT. Well... it's positive. Like, definitely positive. Which has never happened before. And now I don't know what to do, both literally and figuratively. I honestly believe it will end in another chemical, but I'm struggling because with all the previous ones, tests at 10dpo revealed nothing, so this is different.

So I'm kind of panicking (OK, actually panicking) because I feel like I should be *doing* something to save this one somehow, but I don't know what to do. I know there isn't much... basically the only thing I can think of is to check my progesterone levels, but my RE doesn't ""believe in"" that, so I'd just end up fighting with her over it. But since this is our last chance before we head to IVF in August, I want to do everything in my power to try to make it work.

So I guess my question is: I've never had a test this positive, or this early. Do I call my RE and ask to be tested? And should I push to have my progesterone checked, in case it being low has been part of the problem? (For reference, I'm on letrozole).

Thank you so much in advance for dealing with my n00b question. <3

ETA: Thank you so incredibly much to everyone who's chimed in here, I really can't tell you how much it means to me. <3  I called my RE's office, and I'll be going tomorrow morning for HCG and progesterone tests, so my fingers are crossed that we get some good news.

We were allowed to try again as soon as we wanted, so we started right away. My period came at about 6 weeks after giving birth. No luck yet, but it took two years to get pregnant with Eilidh. I hope it's faster this time. :/

Everything you're feeling is normal, and hard, but still normal. I hate pregnant people and people who get to bring their babies home.

So at least I know I ovulated this cycle, even though the actual ovulation day is uncertain.

I'm using two apps and two thermometers.  One thermometer I use to temp vaginally, the other orally.  One app is a period tracker that I've been using for 5 years (well before I had even met my husband) which seems to just take the average of historical trends or an explicit positive OPK entry with no consideration of BBT.  I track vaginal temps with this app, and the screenshot you saw was from this app.

The other app is called easy@home, which records readings from a bluetooth thermometer.  I use this thermometer orally.  This one has some sort of algorithm, though I'm not really sure what it is.

I was traveling in May and didn't have any on my OPK stuff, so what you see if the app's predicted ovulation day.  For this month, I manually set my ovulation date based on the positive OPK results even though the actual day could be one or two days later.  Do you think I should manually adjust based on FAM?

I had downloaded Ovia right before my first CP, then disabled it because it was upsetting getting updates on my ""bean"" which was at the time bleeding out of me.  Fertility friend sounds like a good app to look into.  I'll give it a try and maybe retire the old period tracker app.  Thanks!!

Alright-y. Assuming I know what I'm doing, the link above should lead you to photos of Doggo #3, also known as Rainbow dog. (though let's be clear, I think you ladies are the only one's in on this secret rainbow dog thing lol)

Doggo #3 is fitting in well, we are starting to get a routine and figure out how a 3 dog household of horse dogs works. We've had up to 4 (adult) dogs at one time, but not 3 of this size at once. There are some challenges with that.

Otherwise things are alright. Amusingly, doggo #3 is not aware he's 110lbs. This means theres a lot of him throwing himself around as if he were a 30lbs puppy. Consequently, he's knocked me over a time or two, or swatted me hard with a paw while playing. Normally this would be fine, but I recently started taking a baby asprin..... I bruise like a peach. I look like I've been doing some sort of really adventurous activity. And not just managing a yard of horse-dogs.

Otherwise, yeah, life is alright.
Thinking I might make a new account soon, so if I show up in a few days with a new account I'll reintroduce myself. :)

About What Was Lost: Twenty Writers on Miscarriage, Healing, and Hope - This was my least favorite. I didn't really connect with any of these stories, but they are all short and manageable. 

Knocked Up, Knocked Down: Postcards of Miscarriage and Other Misadventures from the Brink of Parenthood - This employs a lot of dark humor, I liked it a lot but I read it several months after the second miscarriage, I don't know if I could have handled it immediately after. 

Against All Odds: An Intimate Journey through the Trials of Miscarriage - This one is about a lady's journey in the 70's and 80's so obviously a bit dated RE: medical stuff but it was a comforting read. 

Coming to Term: Uncovering the Truth About Miscarriage - This was the best of the four, it's actually written from a husband's perspective, which seems a little weird, but I think it's well done. 

Spoiler alert/trigger warning: Most of these do have mention of successful pregnancies, so if you're not in that place right now, I would probably not read them. 

That said, Aside from Coming to Term, I bought the others (very cheaply) on amazon and would be more than willing to pass them along if you're interested. Just PM me.

It does hurt to be around people&#39;s babies, but for me, I also crave to be around babies. I want so badly to hold a baby, to nurse a baby, but the painful part is that it won&#39;t be my baby, the one I lost. I had a one year old dumped in my lap about a month after my son was born, and THAT was awful, he cried immediately and the mom just walked off.

Each app will have a different algorithm as to when they conclude ovulation happened.  The rule of thumb for FAM (fertility awareness method) is that three consecutive temps need to be higher than the previous six to confirm ovulation.  

On the May chart, to me it looks like they got ovulation wrong using the FAM rule alone.  I am more inclined to believe that your ovulation date for May was the 20th (if I am looking at the chart correctly).  

For June, it appears you ovulated on the 18th using the FAM rule again.  

I think you said you've been using OPKs, which means once you get a positive OPK, your body is gearing to ovulate within the next 24-36 hours (according to my RE).  You should expect a temp jump a few days after the OPK, which you did have on the 18th of this month.  

Also something to keep in mind is that the egg will need to be fertilized in the 12-24 hours that it is ""alive"" so to speak.  This is almost always the last day of your fertile window which is why I believe your ovulation dates are wrong (because the app you are using is putting your ovulation dates in the middle of the window).  

While you are sleeping with less blankets in a colder room, your temps are significantly lower than May's temperatures but as long as you see that jump, you are fine.  

For what it is worth, I use about three different apps and compare them all to see what info they give me.  I use Ovia, Kindara and Fertility Friend.  Ovia is more unicorn-y but I still use it so eh.  Kindara is really good for tracking data but it doesn't tell you much unless you view your chart on a desktop/laptop.  I find Fertility Friend most useful.  Based on all your info you input, it will determine your ovulation date based on temps and OPK info and I've found it to be pretty darn accurate.  

It isn't flawless though.  FF has put my ovulation date last Wednesday but based on various other factors (including the fam rule), I believe I ovulated on Thursday. So I marked Thursday as ovulation day on Ovia and Kindara and frequently compare.

My dad sounds the same. Good job for doing your duty for father's day. I ignored it and feel guilty.

But if I can vent a little to you, I'm going crazy with my dad being a manchild when I should just be focusing on getting ready for baby... And I don't know what to do about it. Maybe you'll have some thoughts or maybe you just won't mind listening.

So a couple weeks ago my mom asked me to call her. Uh oh, never a good sign. She starts the call by asking if I think my dad and I have a good relationship right now. Uhhh. We don't talk much but he never reaches out to me except to sometimes send weird liberal-hating texts to try and provoke me. He rarely asks about my life. Our phone conversations are brief and mundane. She then says my dad asked her to tell me he doesn't feel appreciated or respected by me and doesn't think we're in a good place or that I ever properly thanked them for paying for half my college tuition. Whaaaaa? Out of the blue. Also, I graduated 7 YEARS ago. And of course I was appreciative but there is just so much wrong here with his expectation of continuous gratitude from his adult, doing-just-fine daughter. 

He also always does this, makes my mom do the confronting. He even asked her to bring it up when she traveled to attend my shower recently (that my husband threw for us because she didn't offer, but w/e). He knew the shower was coed and casual but he decided not to come, btw. Thankfully my mom sensed that bringing all this up during my shower weekend would have been totally inappropriate. She asked me what I thought I could do to make things better. I was just amazed at how he had to make this special time for me/my husband all about him and how he feels hurt. Ugh also if you think things aren't great, why don't YOU do something about it, why is it on me?! Freaking take an interest in my life! I'm having a baby in just a few weeks! I'm BUSY, and this drama is not my priority! I said I needed to think about it and haven't reached out since. Then my 30th birthday came and went and my parents didn't call or text until a couple days later to ask if I got the card they mailed me. WTF. 

I am just not even sure what to say to either of them. They want to visit when the baby arrives and I want my mom's help but they will be coming as a package deal. I guess my choices are ignore his behavior and just communicate with my mom and see him when the baby arrives, or reach out to my mom and/or him about it, but not sure what I'd say besides a big FU.

It's definitely not your fault, and I'm sure that thought hasn't even crossed your friends mind.

In my opinion, I would not visit with your baby. I am almost a year out from my loss now and I still avoid young babies as often as possible, having a baby around straight after my loss would have been torture.

I would also be prepared that your friend may pull away from you for a while. It may be that seeing or speaking to you is too much of a reminder of all the plans and hopes and dreams that she had for her own baby, that are now never going to happen.

I guess my advice is to be there for whatever she needs, whether that is a shoulder to cry on or some space.
 
Edit: I just reread your post. I think the first thing you need to do is to get a read on how SHE feels about visits right now. I know you want to be there for her, but when we got bad news about my babies I just wanted to be alone with my husband. I'm sure her phone is going crazy as she tells family etc, and visitors on top of that might be too much.

Baby girl arrived Friday at 4:30 PM, which was exactly 39 weeks. I was so so nervous but everything went so much better than I could have hoped!

We went out for sushi on Thursday (I don't like actual raw fish sushi anyways so I never felt like I missed out during pregnancy), then went straight to the hospital, got there a little early at 7:45 and I tried to get DH to let us sit in the car for 15 mins because I needed all the time! But we went in! They knew me because of all the NSTs and we got put in a room immediately. Gown on, peed in cup, got checked and was still at 1cm, 60% effaced. It took them a long time searching both arms for the IV spot which made me so nervous (it seemed so weird and painful to have on on your arm) but she got it in 1 go even though it was really deep. I got super overwhelmed and cried a little... then apologized for it lol. Lots of emotions! Cervadil was placed around 10 and I was told to try and sleep and I would just have period cramps, which was good because it meant it was working. Did not sleep. Contractions started around 12. They got progressively worse over the next 2 hours and I had to close my eyes and just try to breathe. At 6 the nurse told me they were less than a minute apart for over 1 min long, peaking off the chart, and she wouldn't be surprised if I was a lot farther, and she could take it out and check anytime. I still thought I wasn't even in real labor so I said I would try to stick it out until the original time, which was 10. Water broke on its own around 7 and contractions got 20x worse... there was meconium so NICU would attend birth. Then at 9:30 I gave up and asked for the epidural.

Before epidural the cervadil came out and I had made it to a whopping 3cm, was so disappointed! She said I was super tense so the epidural would help. She came in like 5 mins and placement wasn't bad, honestly hurt less than the IV, I only felt the numbing and not any placement at all. It took like 45 mins for it to kick in and she had to add other medicine to it, but once it worked it was the best thing ever! Plus my contractions stayed and I didn't need any pitocin at all. Next check in 2 hours I was at a 9 and 100% effaced! Baby had moved from -3 to +1, and I was so relieved! The epidural was the best! Around 2 I was at 10 and +2 and they said we could start pushing, they were just going to let my dr know and get set up. Actually started pushing far 230. Felt absolutely nothing but they assured me I was doing great. It was hard to push not being able to feel anything, but I was very happy not to feel any of it! Had to get antibiotics because I had a fever and we took a break for like 30 mins. They called my dr that it was go time at 345 and she got there by 4. She used some kind of oil and did lots of perineal massage, and baby was born at 4:30. I only had a internal 1st degree tear she sewed up, felt nothing still! Baby was completely covered in vernix and I didn't get a picture of her like that, which I'm kind of sad about even though it was gross! They had to clear her lungs for about 10 mins and then we got our skin to skin. She weighed exactly 6lbs, which is what the perinatologist estimated she would be at birth. She's so cute but my husband asked me not to post her picture on here or else I would share!

We are slowly getting breast feeding but it's hard. She alternates between chilling and screaming at me, so we're supplementing with formula and I'm also pumping. My tiny Acups are making milk though! 

Family did not respect our wishes at all and made stressed me out more than anything else. My mom announced on Facebook before me. My MIL called on Saturday, from my closet (didn't know she was at my house, she had coordinated it with my parents who live in Vegas and were staying with our dogs). She told me she bought me a different laundry hamper and asked me if I wanted her to organize my closet. They also planted a bunch of plants on our balcony. They were waiting at the hospital at 2pm on Friday when I specifically told everyone we would let them know as soon as she was born so they could head over and meet her after our golden hour time. A bunch of people came to the hospital without asking. We had constant guests and I had not slept since 6:30am on Thursday! I had to stop my MIL from kissing babies face and she acted like I had told her not to look at the baby! MIL gets cold sores! SIL (her daughter) is a baby nurse, I feel like there's no way MIL could not know not to do that. MIL and FIL, who live 55 miles from us, asked us to rent out our townhouse and go live with them so I could be a stay at home mom and she could help watch the baby. Our townhouse isn't big enough for a baby apparently and my other SIL is a stay at home mom and that baby is doing so much better than if she had gone to daycare. I make more money than my husband, I like my job, need my health insurance for me and baby, and they're super flexible with scheduling. My MiL is super nice and I would still go crazy. Even in the hospital the baby cried and I said she was tired she hasn't slept, and she was like no she needs to eat, and I told her she just ate, but she still goes to the baby ""oh you're just so hungry, you need mommy to feed you!"" I took her and she fell asleep instantly... (take that MIL!)

So yes, annoying but well meaning kind of family, but feeling just so so overwhelmingly happy despite that! 

Thank you so much from the bottom of my heart to everyone here for getting me through this pregnancy! I will be here stalking all your stories for at least a little longer!

Even in the hospital the baby cried and I said she was tired she hasn&#39;t slept, and she was like no she needs to eat, and I told her she just ate, but she still goes to the baby &quot;oh you&#39;re just so hungry, you need mommy to feed you!&quot; I took her and she fell asleep instantly... (take that MIL!)</p>

<p>So yes, annoying but well meaning kind of family, but feeling just so so overwhelmingly happy despite that! </p>

<p>Thank you so much from the bottom of my heart to everyone here for getting me through this pregnancy! I will be here stalking all your stories for at least a little longer! </p>

Did you wait to try or start trying right away?

How long did it take you to get a positive?

How did you deal with the two week wait after loss? I am feeling tremendous pressure to get pregnant again ASAP and am afraid I will freak out if it doesn't happen.

If my husband did that to me NOW - after not drinking for almost a year and never going out, I&#39;d kill him. But - I seem to see this kind of pop up a bit for men when their wives are pregnant. Maybe they are trying to de-stress, get one last hooray in before their &#39;fun lives are over&#39; (I say this sarcastically - but you know what I mean). When he&#39;s feeling better, maybe explain to your husband why last night hurt you and maybe get to the root of why it happened.

Ugh. Yesterday he went out with a friend around 2pm and didn't come back until 4.30am... without sending any text or calling or anything. Granted he never said when he'll me back.. but I sort of assumed it would still be daytime.. same day.. and certainly not over 14 hours of being awol. What's your opinion of this guys? I'm curious what you'd think about this without any context. 

To give context... this used to be a problem when we were both in college (over a decade ago) when he'd go out with his buddies and say he'll be back at midnight and then not show up until the next day - all this without texting me and not picking up his phone when I'd call. This was really anxiety provoking for me because at that time I struggled with PTSD and had panic attacks. Well since then things have gotten way better, we've grown up, he doesn't go out that much, he's usually in contact with me when he does, picks up his phone when I call, etc... So this hasn't been a problem in ageeees. Until yesterday. And while my ptsd and panic attacks are long gone.. obviously anxiety still lingers especially at this vulnerable time. So cue in yesterday, when it's 11pm and I'm thinking... surely, he's not gonna pull this shit now, now I'm pregnant, that he knows I would worry. I also didn't want to call him because I didn't want to have to fucking tell him... 'oh remember that over the 14 years that we've been together this kind of shit made me stress the fuck out so much so I couldn't sleep - yeah, so that's not cool to do that to me now when I'm here growing a baby."" Well.. in these 14 hours he didn't text nor call. I couldn't sleep all night. Because, surely he wouldn't pull this shit now when I'm pregnant.. so it might mean something is wrong.. What if he is lying somewhere in a ditch passed out drunk? What if he drowned and the friend he was with didn't notice/see it and thought he'd just gone home (they went swimming)? etc. I knew that these thoughts weren't rational and that most likely he's just being an inconsiderate asshole which also made me super angry at the same time as fearful. Then, I was stressed that baby will feel it. I read that from week 16 babies can sense mother's emotions especially when she's happy and sad/stressed; and that when stressed baby in utero will self sooth by sucking a thumb. So I hated that possibly the baby was feeling that too. I cried intermediately while trying to fall asleep and trying to relax. Developed stomach ache (which I was terrified was uterus ache.. who the hell knows). Ugh... then I heard him come in the house and struggle with opening/closing the gate... and then pass out downstairs. I was relieved he didn't come upstairs to bed because I was in no mood to deal with a drunk him or to smell booze. But a part of me was pissed that he didn't even check that I was alright (after all he didn't hear from me in over 14 hours too). 

I'm definitely getting a massage today because I only got 2 hours of sleep and my shoulders and back are killing me and I need to do something nice for myself. I don't really understand how my DH, who is very loving and has been quite helpful so far, can just do this and not even realize there was anything wrong with it. This morning I went downstairs already dressed and grabbed my bag to go out for breakfast alone. He woke up and glossy eyed asked: ""are you angry with me,"" I answered: ""what do you think?"" and he replied: ""Yes, but why? I don't understand why. I slept downstairs not to disturb you."" So, I just don't know. At this point I'm exhausted and mostly sad. Happy that he is ok of course. But just sad for having to deal with this shit.

Ok, I'm done venting. Sorry for such a long post - if anyone's actually read it, I'd love to hear any opinions of whether you'd find this acceptable behavior or not. Am I just bat shit crazy for thinking this is not a normal thing to do? 

**tl:dr:** DH went out to meet with a friend at 2pm and didn't come back until 4am. Didn't call or text. I couldn't sleep, had anxious thoughts, afraid baby will feel that I'm being sad and stressed. DH doesn't think he did anything wrong, probably still drunk. Now I'm just sad (while relieved he's actually ok).

edit: Ended up crying while eating my breakfast both from frustration of last night and relief that it's all over and he's fine. He is drunk/hangover and throwing up. He apologized and said it was ""literally the last time he's done that,"" and said ""if it's any consolation I will be feeling like shit today"" - no, that's no consolation for me. Consolation is that he is back and safe. I'm glad he apologized and said it's the last time (of course that was yet another of my fears: what if he does it when i'm closer to full term? what if he does it when our child is here?). He still doesnt understand why it upset me though and I had to leave for work so we didnt discuss furher. I'm exhausted. Thank you for your replies!

Ugh. Yesterday he went out with a friend around 2pm and didn&#39;t come back until 4.30am... without sending any text or calling or anything. Granted he never said when he&#39;ll me back.. but I sort of assumed it would still be daytime.. same day.. and certainly not over 14 hours of being awol. What&#39;s your opinion of this guys? I&#39;m curious what you&#39;d think about this without any context. </p>

<p>To give context... this used to be a problem when we were both in college (over a decade ago) when he&#39;d go out with his buddies and say he&#39;ll be back at midnight and then not show up until the next day - all this without texting me and not picking up his phone when I&#39;d call. This was really anxiety provoking for me because at that time I struggled with PTSD and had panic attacks.

If you are feeling afraid of what family will say, maybe you wait to tell them. A few days or a week won&#39;t hurt. This needs to be about what you need. Or, what I did because of feeling not ready to talk, I wrote close friends and family an email and said I wasn&#39;t ready to talk yet. Maybe you don&#39;t go to the gathering this weekend, if that&#39;s what you need, it&#39;s okay. Don&#39;t get anxious from feeling trapped, decide what is best for <em>you</em> and do that unapologetically. </p>

<p>I know you worry that you are running out of strength. Don&#39;t be afraid, it will come back, you just need some time. Take all the time you need. </p>

<p>However, because it&#39;s all a big &quot;maybe&quot; at this stage, we&#39;re having discussions on whether we even want to try again. The last MMC left me in a pretty screwed up place emotionally and I&#39;m just not sure I have it in me to start trying again. Until we make a decision, I&#39;m staying firmly on the birth control pills because I&#39;m just not sure how much more destroyed hope I can take!</p>

Exciting to see the little jumping bean, hoping everything is okay.

Yesterday I had weird pain for most of the day, but I'm hoping was RLP? I'm still not sure exactly what that is. 

Anyway, glad for a scan today for sure!

Edit:

Stubborn baby and they couldn't  measure anything, but he seems to be okay. Heart rate was great, he just didn't want to move. Basically laying face down. Turned a few times to wave us away, then rolled face down again. Luckily they won't be charging us for the NT scan, so hopefully this visit might be covered by insurance then.

In fact, after loss, your body may not return to normal for a while. Mine never did. My cycles were completely out of whack and unpredictable after my first loss.

When I was also in the height of symptom spotting, thinking that every single symptom certainly meant a BFP on my first cycle trying after loss, someone on this sub said to me ""women's bodies can do anything at any time for any reason"". I of course did not want to hear this because I wanted all of my very strange symptoms to mean I was pregnant. I of course wasn't and it was months before I'd become pregnant and I experienced two more losses as a result. So women's bodies can be crazy and loss does that to us.
