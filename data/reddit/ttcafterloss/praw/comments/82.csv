I am of the firm belief that people who are overweight are overweight for a reason.  It's not laziness, or gluttony, or any other sort of moral/behavioural inadequacy.  There's a physiological issue that's causing excessive appetite, insufficient metabolic rate, or both.  There is nothing wrong with you as a person - almost nobody can fight the obesity battle and continue fighting it without some help. 

Diet and exercise is BS, if you have to eat 900 calories a day and exercise 2 hours a day to lose weight, something is wrong.  Weight loss is almost never sustainable without intervention.

Now, the gastric band, promised us so much progress and results with less invasiveness.  It's awful! Highest failure rate of bariatric surgeries and IMO should not be done because it's a waste of time and resources.  

Why does the band fail? The soft part of your stomach produces a hormone called ghrelin.  Ghrelin is the devil, it makes you hungry, it also is in an inverse relationship with leptin - the fat burning hormone.  As long as the soft part of your stomach is in your body, you will maintain your hungriness.  You're not changing anything about the underlying physiology.  It's really just enforced bulimia, or spreading out your smaller meals, making overall calorie intake the same (this is even worse than eating 3 larger meals in cases of leptin resistance).

But it's not all bad news!!  The alternatives or next steps being a VSG and gastric bypass (roux en y) ARE effective and sustainable ways to lose weight and keep it off!  Both techniques remove the soft part of your stomach that produces ghrelin, so you're actually LESS HUNGRY!  it's actually treating the problem, rather than putting a bandaid on it.  Gastric bypass is especially effective because it reduces the number of calories you can absorb, so it also corrects for low basal metabolic rate.  The body does have a way to shift itself back, so some of the weight lost will probably be gained back but you'll definitely be better off than before! 

You can start TTC quite soon after weight loss surgery, and I bet it would increase your fertility as well. If you continue without any drastic changes, who knows how long it'll take you to get pregnant again?  Might be fast, but statistics say it would likely be longer... 

If you're really impatient to have a baby, I would do gastric bypass.  The weight would come off faster, you could increase your chances faster and sustain the change for the future. 

There is a bariatric surgery subreddit and most people there say their only regret is not doing it sooner!  Maybe check that out - they're may be people who were TTC in there too! 

I don't think you're selfish at all - the desire to have a child is overwhelming!  And we are instinctual beings - obesity is a health problem, not a mental problem.  Your trauma may have contributed, but it's not the whole story.

First, I'm sorry for your loss. I'm sure you've heard it a lot, and it's the common denominator between all of us, but I'm still sorry it happened.

Second, I feel ya. I had the lap band in 2010. Lost a total of 35 pounds and got pregnant, carried to term, have a wonderful child. Then never lost the baby weight. Prior to lap band, my highest was 308. At the end of a lot of things I won't put you through listening, I made it to 317 in 2016. In 2016, a few months after turning 30, I had a stroke. During the stroke, my blood pressure was fine, sugar was fine - they literally found no reason why I was having a stroke, but because I was overweight, you guessed it - that must be why. I ended up going to see a bariatric surgeon in a few cities over and he told me that the lap band has the highest failure rate of both weight loss and keeping weight off. Which, while it sounds silly, made me feel a bit less like a failure as a person. After six months of check ins, I had gastric bypass surgery and dropped down to 208 in about 18 months. Cut to now and I'm at 247 due to some poor eating habits, but back on my grind and steadily losing. 

I say all of that to say don't beat yourself up. I felt so stupid, like ""man who has weight loss surgery and then gains back all of it AND some?! I must suck."" While some of the weight gain was absolutely my fault, overall doctors know there are some issues, and it may not be the best fit for everyone. So be nice to yourself. 

To your original point, your doctor is right. There are higher risks when you're pregnant and at a high weight. It doesn't mean that you're guaranteed to have issues, or pregnancy losses, but empirical data does show that it can impact you and baby. Does that mean you're insane for wanting it? Nope. I've felt insane for the last year. Who holds their pee the entire work ride home so they can immediately lock themselves in a bathroom to pee on a stick, wait five minutes, then take a picture of it and compare it to yesterday's? Crazy people, that's who (I'm the crazy person, in case it wasn't obvious). 

It might be good to spend at least the next few months (till January 1) working on your health, and then reevaluate at the beginning of the year.

Hi all, here is my brief history:
Unexplained infertility. TTC x 3 years (timed intercourse, IUI, you name it). First round of IVF in August. Did this while my husband was deployed because we thought the irony of him being gone would bring us some weird luck. Well, it worked.

Good hcg levels. Dreamt of a belly, a nursery, told coworkers that knew about the journey. Life was great. 

7 week ultrasound showed growth was 4 days behind and there was an extremely low heart rate. The pregnancy was not expected to last, but I had to go back in one week (today) to check progress. 

Today I was told there was no heart beat and a clot. I was told to stop my medications (estrogen and progesterone) and to expect to pass tissue in 3-10 days. I’m scared. 

My husband is deployed still. I (ironically) work in labor and delivery and can’t face going to work. I guess I’m here to tell my story just to get it out there and to seek out a group for support/ knowledge/ experience/ so on. Thank you guys for reading.

Not sure how to even think about doing this again, even though all I want is a family.",[],,t1_f1frkj8,False,0,[],False,"<div class=""md""><p>First time pregnancy IVF, first MC</p>

It’s just something you live with and learn how to manage. I give the fear the space it needs and deserves. It is entirely valid, after all. But ultimately, I refuse to let it control me.  On this day in particular I am a little bitter about being resilient and moving forward. Because it seems ruthless of me at times. I try to move forward while acknowledging my losses. Giving them attention in my mind. So I don’t feel like I abandoned them by trying again. 

I agree wholeheartedly with the responses that the fear of not trying is worse. 

We lost our first baby, a chemical pregnancy. So when I got pregnant the second time, I tried to distance myself emotionally from that pregnancy. When I went into labor at 18 weeks and my son died, my grief over his death was not lessened by the initial protection I tried to give myself. Not at all. Didn’t work. It only left me feeling guilty for trying not to bond with him. He would have been due today. 

We start IVF in a week. Honestly, I am utterly petrified of IVF, but if that results in a third miracle, I will be emotionally all in.  Fear and love and resilience and hope. And whatever else it brings. 

Break down the fear into bits and pieces you can chew. If you look at it overall, it’s overwhelming. Take it in pieces. Work on getting comfortable with a certain level. Then set it aside. And then sit with the next piece of your fear. One inch at a time. Break it down. Get comfortable with it. Then take the next piece. Just keep building tolerance for it. And it does actually get easier.

Edit:  I wanted to add that I’m very sorry you have been robbed of the hope of a positive pregnancy experience in the future. I totally understand and relate. I hope will allow yourself to enjoy it as much as possible under the circumstances because the outcome is out of your control. And being guarded didn’t help me. Spared me nothing.

I just took a one cycle break but I focused on me, I didn't track, I didn't worry about my cycle, and just worked on other projects. It really got me to a better place.

I'm not 100% there, but I am better.

Pregnancy will never be the same for me as it is for someone who has never experienced a loss. It will never be, because loss has changed me. But over time, it's been easier to accept that as my new reality, because it's the reality that will bring me to my rainbow baby one day.

From what little research I've done it seems very common for first pregnancies for whatever reason. 

My guy has been very understanding but also unemotional at the same time. 

These communities have been at least a place I can go to when I feel like I need to know that I'm not alone. I don't even know if I have any friends that have gone through it. Since nobody talks about it. I don't think it should be a shameful thing that we need to keep to ourselves.

The other thing is the pain of a natural miscarriage. I wasn't prepared for it or for seeing recognizable parts. Mine started on September 1st and only finished last week. It was always horrific having to go to the toilet. The last thing to come out of my was the *I think* the placenta. It was solid and it came out unnoticed in my underwear. I had thought I was mostly done by then (this was the 17th).

Maybe it wasn't as bad as I made it out to be? Maybe we could have made it work and I'm just lazy?  

But I go back and I look at what I wrote 2 days after my procedure, when the grief was still really raw, and I remember why we made the choice we did. When I look at the numbers we were given I remember that they really WERE as bad as I thought. I would still make the same choice.

You're not alone. I tx'd for medical reasons 6 weeks ago for Congenital Diaphragmatic Hernia, and a little bit of creeping through your comment history suggests that's what your baby was diagnosed with as well (it's just a guess, but the 1 in 2500 number, having to be put on breathing equipment right after birth and have a hernia repair, they're all very familiar to me). If that's the case you're definitely not alone. And even if it's not CDH in your case, please know that there are many of us who tx'd for a gray diagnosis (i.e., tx a pregnancy that wasn't necessarily a death sentence). We also understand your reasoning and weighing the needs of your unborn child vs. the needs of your living child and having to choose between them.   

Again, I am so sorry. As hard as it is, try to enjoy your last few days with your baby. You are making this decision out of love. My husband and I actually left our living child with his parents and went out for one last, nice meal, just the three of us (him, me, and baby) the night before we started the process. It was sad but peaceful, and I'm glad that he and I could spend some time alone just focusing on each other.  

I don't know if you were given any options, but if they give you the option of keepsakes like footprints or holding the baby, take them up on it. I was given the option of induced labor or a D&E procedure, and I opted for the D&E. While I'm glad I was asleep for the procedure, sometimes I wish I would have opted for the induced labor so I would have been able to hold my baby just once, but I think that may have come with its own trauma. But I don't regret receiving a certificate with her little footprints. I couldn't hold her physical body outside of me but I do cling to what few things I have that were ""hers"" that remind me she was real.

You can also look for the group ""Ending a Wanted Pregnancy,"" they have a website as well as a secret FB group for parents who have had to TFMR.

I had a D&C at 17w with our son. It was a 2-day procedure with the laminaria. The worst part physically for me was the laminaria insertion; dilation was easily controlled with Advil.

—My breasts engorged a couple of days after the surgery which was extremely painful, but my milk never came in. 

—Emotionally the first 2 days after the procedure were incredibly dark, difficult and complex. The next 5 months were, too (until his EDD really), but those first 2 days were absolute hell. 

—I had gained about 6 lbs. and it took me almost 3 months to get back to my pre-pregnancy weight (hormones). I’m pretty fit and petite so that was frustrating for me. 

—We chose to cremate our baby so we could have his remains at home with us. It was the best decision for our family. We bought him an urn that we keep in our bedroom. 

—We named him. We didn’t at first, but a few month after, we named him. People kept asking us for his name in order to honor him or pray for us, and it felt bad to say we hadn’t named him, so we did posthumously. 

—I can’t recommend the book Empty Cradle, Broken Heart highly enough. It was a life-saver for me.

I started ovulating again really soon after my miscarriage started even though I continued to have positive betas. My first ovulation post-MC occurred when I was \~25mIU/mL though, so quite a bit lower than where you're at.

That said, I also bled and spotted pretty much continuously for around 70 days. However, I took misoprostol for a missed miscarriage and had retained products of conception for a very long time, which was why I continued to bleed and spot.

I would say it's possible that you ovulated and this is a period, but it's also possible that it's more bleeding from retained products, or that it's a breakthrough bleed (like a period but without ovulation). I'm sure there are other possibilities I haven't thought of, so a discussion with your doc is definitely in order.

I found it very useful to track my cycle religiously through the MC, because that helped me to understand what was going on with my body, and is how I was able to confirm when I was ovulating during that time. If you charted before your MC, you could maybe try taking your BBT over the next few days to see if they're in the right range for you during a period or during the follicular phase of your cycle? It might be informative, depending on how much you already know about your cycles.

I believe the major indicators of possible infection are: foul-smelling discharge (so if the blood smells funky), and fever. If you have either of those, you may want to consider calling telehealth or your local equivalent for advice, going to a walk-in, or possibly to emerg.

Do you know what you've been tested for? After four losses, you should be able to have an RPL panel that will test for things that may affect your ability to carry a pregnancy to term, like clotting disorders and undiagnosed diabetes. You should also ask about having karyotype testing done on your and husband, if you haven't already. Most early losses are due to chromosomal issues. If one or both of you has a balanced translocation, your chances of conceiving a genetically normal baby are lower. IVF would help with that, because you could do pre-implantation genetic testing.

Otherwise, I'm not convinced that standard infertility treatments are effective for RPL. Like you, my husband and I seem to have no problems conceiving. In six cycles of trying over the past 10 months, we have conceived twice but lost both pregnancies. I have a normal karyotype, as did our most recent loss. We haven't had my husband's karyotype tested, but he was 4/4 with his first wife (4 kids, no losses; by comparison, I was 1/4 with my first husband) and it seems unlikely that he has a translocation that could be causing our losses. (I'm still going to ask for karyotype testing on him at our next RE appointment.) Of course, I am old, so my chances of conceiving a baby with a trisomy are greater even if my karyotype is normal, but I'm not very eager to jump to IVF. It doesn't seem like my last loss had anything to do with genetics, and I can't imagine how much more devastating a miscarriage would be with a PGD/PGS tested embryo.

I think I had a similar situation as you: I was supposed to be 9 weeks along but kept measuring further and further behind (the final measurement was 7w3d), and I had initially gone to the ER because of a bleed diagnosed as a subchorionic hematoma. I also agonized over whether there was an underlying cause of the hematoma that meant it would happen again, but after a lot of research, I now think that the slow growth was very likely a sign of a trisomy (or other chromosomal abnormality) incompatible with life, and the hematoma was just another symptom of it. My doctor also thinks there's no reason to expect a repeat of this experience (but she did express sympathy that this happened with my first pregnancy).

I think reactions to misoprostol vary a lot from person to person. It was quite painful and nauseating for me -- I ended up briefly passing out and falling to the ground while vomiting in the bathroom (and that was with anti-nausea meds and narcotics, and I'd never before fainted in my life and didn't even have morning sickness). It was awful. Even worse, it ended up being an incomplete miscarriage, and after intermittent heavy bleeding for two weeks, I ended up having a D&C after all. I'd wanted to avoid it mainly because I'd read the recovery period was longer and I'd have to wait a few months to try again, but my doctor said that wasn't necessary. They used a local instead of general anesthetic, and while it was painful, it only took about 5 minutes and I was just so relieved to have it over with. I had light bleeding for a couple of days, and now five days out I'm down to barely-there spotting and I feel a million times better. Knowing what I know now, I wish I'd just done a D&C to start with, but of course I had no way of knowing how it would go.

I know miscarriage is awful and somehow makes all bad outcomes seem more likely (or at least, that's how I felt), but know that you're very very unlikely to have long-term side effects whatever method you choose.

Now I wish I had just gotten it over with because I have to do it now anyways. There’s a book called “Not Broken” by Dr Lora Shahine. It goes over all the different causes of RPL and testing involved.</p>

I’m terrified but I’m almost 31 so I feel like I need to start trying.
My husband and I talk almost daily about how trying again doesn’t mean we are trying to replace our son. 
What I have done is thrown myself into therapy. Initially I was going twice a week, then once a week now every other week. It’s helped me a lot, I also got lucky and found an amazing therapist right away, she was recommended to me by one of my delivery nurses. I also started working out again regularly with a trainer as soon as my DR gave me the all clear. Working out with someone else has helped me reclaim my body as well as provide me an outlet for my anger and my trainer is kind of like another therapist. Sometimes I want to talk about my loss or trying to get pregnant with her or some day we just talk about podcasts and our dogs but either way it’s another person that just lets me talk.
So therapy and working out have been huge for me. Now that we’re trying again I’ve cut back on my work house again so I can spend more time listening to my body and brain and keep stress low.  If I need to sit on the couch for a day or two and do nothing I give myself permission to do that. I give myself permission to do whatever I think I need. My husband has supported me in this “do what I need to do” attitude the only rule is I can’t get aggravated when he wants to check in with me mentally and if he thinks we need to schedule an ASAP appointment with our therapist we go.
I’m sorry that I can’t tell you how to get rid of the fear because I still have it and I don’t think it’s ever going to go away (for me at least.) The thing is it’s a legitimate fear.... I think you just reach a point where you feel strong enough to wade into the water despite the fears. 
I hope that you’re able to find a routine or outlet that helps you process and work through everything you are feeling.

My husband and I talk almost daily about how trying again doesn’t mean we are trying to replace our son. 
What I have done is thrown myself into therapy. Initially I was going twice a week, then once a week now every other week. It’s helped me a lot, I also got lucky and found an amazing therapist right away, she was recommended to me by one of my delivery nurses. I also started working out again regularly with a trainer as soon as my DR gave me the all clear. Working out with someone else has helped me reclaim my body as well as provide me an outlet for my anger and my trainer is kind of like another therapist. Sometimes I want to talk about my loss or trying to get pregnant with her or some day we just talk about podcasts and our dogs but either way it’s another person that just lets me talk.
So therapy and working out have been huge for me. Now that we’re trying again I’ve cut back on my work house again so I can spend more time listening to my body and brain and keep stress low.  If I need to sit on the couch for a day or two and do nothing I give myself permission to do that. I give myself permission to do whatever I think I need. My husband has supported me in this “do what I need to do” attitude the only rule is I can’t get aggravated when he wants to check in with me mentally and if he thinks we need to schedule an ASAP appointment with our therapist we go.
I’m sorry that I can’t tell you how to get rid of the fear because I still have it and I don’t think it’s ever going to go away (for me at least.) The thing is it’s a legitimate fear.... I think you just reach a point where you feel strong enough to wade into the water despite the fears. 
I hope that you’re able to find a routine or outlet that helps you process and work through everything you are feeling. Lastly I do think that it gets easier, I can tell you that I’m much stronger today than I was 5 months ago and I believe that if I continue working on it, I will continue to get stronger. &lt;3</p>

Now every time I take a negative test I want to go back in time and tell the doctor to stop like I really wanted to. Why is it that we got pregnant by accident before but now that we’re ready and trying.. it’s not so easy..</p>

You’re going through a potentially life-threatening experience. Don’t be afraid to tell people what is going on. This is not your fault in any way, it’s just extremely unlucky.

I had an EP in my right tube last fall and they were never able to visualize it, I just knew where it was bc I could feel it since implantation. They followed my betas for two weeks before finally checking my progesterone and diagnosing the ectopic.

I had 2 doses of MTX and had to work from home for two weeks bc I was in so much pain. I made a little nest on the couch and watched the great British baking show while working on my laptop. The heat from the laptop helped with the pain.

I’m not sure how to do trigger warning things on mobile so TRIGGER WARNING graphic details in the next paragraph:

It was one of the worst experiences of my life, but at least my tube never ruptured. I had full body aches, trouble sleeping or getting comfortable, rectal pressure (feels like you have take a huge poop, but can’t), big time bleeding, and heavy pain in my tube. Not to mention the feeling of impending doom, and the profound grief of knowing there might be a normal embryo in there, it just has no chance of a future.

I could barely walk after the second shot but I refused to let it ruin me, so I got dressed up in a fancy beaded dress, put on some makeup and went out to a steak dinner and a movie with my husband to celebrate our 7th wedding anniversary. I couldn’t eat much, but it was worth it to try.

Don’t let it destroy you, because you will recover and you will be able to try again. Just remember to breathe, and don’t be afraid to ask for help from your family and friends. People came to visit me while I was laid up, and brought us meals, and I’m still grateful for that.

I waited three months to try again to build up my stores of folic acid, which basically disappear when you do the MTX. I do feel slight discomfort in my tube off and on now, which I’m guessing is scar tissue. If I had to go back in time and change my decision, I still would have chosen the MTX, but if I ever have another ectopic, I’m having the damn tube removed. Apparently that’s less expensive, and the recovery time is much shorter. Do your research, though, and whatever you choose, don’t look back.

I was/am VERY fit and active, but I’ve taken it easy the last few weeks. I’ve gone on walks with my dog, which has been good for me. That being said, I just feel “bleh” physically and am nervous to return to the gym. It’s so hard getting back in the swing of things.

I’ve had to cut out the junk food, too. It was starting to get out of hand. I’ve bought lots of yummy healthier options and gotten rid of the temptation. It’s annoying, but also helps when there’s nothing bad to choose from.

But anyway, walks are amazing. Being outside and moving does wonders for the brain. It has helped my mood a lot. Try to just ease yourself back into things and be kind to yourself.

I know she isn’t a callous person. So what I did is I sent her an email the next day explaining my feelings. Explaining how the miscarriage feels, that I am grieving, explaining what I lost. (She has no kids and does t know if she wants them.)
I also told her that I don’t think she’s a bad person, and this is hard for me to write. And that I’m fairly sure that she a) didn’t understand the depth of my pain and b) was uncomfortable and then just said random stuff which ended up being hurtful.

While no one knows the ins and outs of your relationship and what is normal better than you I agree with others that, when you are ready, you should communicate clearly how you feel to your friend before writing the relationship off. 

I didn't tell anyone about my pregnancy and miscarriage because I didn't want to be reminded about it frequently. 

Even after having a miscarriage myself, if one of my friends had a miscarriage (after talking about the miscarriage and making sure she knew she could reach out to me for whatever she needed) I would not want to pester her with texts asking about how the miscarriage was progressing. I wouldn't do this because it would feel to me like an invasion of privacy, while I can understand that to others this kind of communication is extremely important to feel supported.

It's possible that your friend is awkwardly trying to be supportive by giving you space to grieve, especially since she is pregnant herself and could be a physical reminder of the loss.

<p>While no one knows the ins and outs of your relationship and what is normal better than you I agree with others that, when you are ready, you should communicate clearly how you feel to your friend before writing the relationship off. </p>

<p>I didn&#39;t tell anyone about my pregnancy and miscarriage because I didn&#39;t want to be reminded about it frequently. </p>

<p>Even after having a miscarriage myself, if one of my friends had a miscarriage (after talking about the miscarriage and making sure she knew she could reach out to me for whatever she needed) I would not want to pester her with texts asking about how the miscarriage was progressing. I wouldn&#39;t do this because it would feel to me like an invasion of privacy, while I can understand that to others this kind of communication is extremely important to feel supported.</p>

<p>It&#39;s possible that your friend is awkwardly trying to be supportive by giving you space to grieve, especially since she is pregnant herself and could be a physical reminder of the loss. </p>

I have one child after an uncomplicated pregnancy. I checked my TSH after I gave birth, and it went up to 4.5 at one point. 

I have lost three pregnancies since. It could be to age (I was 39-40 during the miscarriages), but I suspect that some of it is related to an auto-immune factor. I had one pregnancy make it to 12 weeks and the others only made it to 8. The pregnancy where I made it to 12 weeks, I had been taking steroids for poison ivy for part of the pregnancy. I think it dampened my immune system to allow the fetus to develop. I saw an RE for a while who did some blood work and said my RPL was likely an autoimmune factor, but could not rule out my age since I never tested the POC.

I do try to eat low carb... it's made me feel a lot better. After my kid was born, I did notice that I felt more run-down, tired, achy, etc, so I wonder if my antibodies ramped up after the birth. When I don't eat as well, I start feeling icky again... my coworker recently announced her second pregnancy to me and started complaining that it was due the same month as her older kid. Seeing her is super triggering for me since all my babies from my miscarriage would have turned 1 before her kid is even born. Since then, I've been eating like shit, so I really need to jump back on the low carb wagon again.

I'm currently not on any thyroid medication as my doctor(s) haven't been able to figure out what my body is doing.

I'm not sure if I'll get thyroid medication since my T3/T4 levels are normal otherwise. I keep reading that there's a difference between ""normal"" levels and ""optimal"" levels though. Do you know what the optimal levels should look like?

A small part of me felt embarrassed we got so excited and told everyone (minus a facebook announcement), but the bigger part finds it helpful that we did. When I did tell others, a family member and close friend opened up about their pregnancy losses (which i had no idea about) and I now have them to lean on for some support, too.</p>

We were heartbroken and it was so hard to be around friends and family- everyone has kids. But each time I did it I felt better. I found baby loss to be so isolating, awkward and painful. I wanted to feel better but for me that meant putting in work. Going to the mall and looking in the stroller. Periodically crying about it. Seeing my friends kids... not holding them but seeing them. And then just recently I held a baby for the first time since my loss. It made me feel like maybe I was ready to have another, like I’d worked through some of it.

So I did the hard thing and exposed myself and I was open about my feelings about how hard it was sometimes.

I&#39;m going to tell him I don&#39;t want to go tonight and hope that he has some understanding. It&#39;s just hard because he&#39;s hurting too and he was so looking forward to this.</p>

Your hCG is dropping rather quickly, so that’s good. And at 20, ovulation could occur soon (or it might not happen until your closer to 5). If there’s only a little bit remaining, I’ve heard that will pass with your next menstrual cycle, which will happen obviously after your body has its first ovulation post MC. 

It’s not necessarily bad practice that they don’t want you taking medicine or doing a D&C yet. You’re really close to having that period that will clear out anything remaining, which is likely why they are waiting. They might not think the potential risks of a D&C or the pain and risks that comes with misoprostol is warranted yet. 

If your hCG isn’t at least almost at 5 at your next draw, and there is still remaining tissue, I would be more concerned. If at next draw you’re not at this point, I personally would probably push for one round of misoprostol, just as an extra help.

The genetic councelling is a joke.  If you haven't done it, spare your time.  The pregnancy is either viable or not.  There is no grey area.

There’s nothing “wrong” with grieving however long you need to. It is your grief. And your love for your child. I honestly don’t know you’ll ever not grief. Even if the waves are just 10ft tall and months apart. You’ll always love your child. 

Also music. There are a few songs which specifically address stillbirth and childloss. Don’t get me wrong I still bawl and cry my heart out hearing these. But sometimes it can be good.


Here are some of my favorites:

Lily Allen - something’s not right 

Gerrit Hofsink - Still

If you haven’t already, I encourage you to find the website for Ending a Wanted Pregnancy and apply to be in their private Facebook group. It’s an amazing group of women who’ve made the decision to end their very loved and wanted pregnancies for a wide variety of reasons. 

What also helps us is an in person TFMR support group. Our genetic counselor gave us the info about it, so I’d encourage you to ask yours (if you have one). Otherwise I think the Ending a Wanted Pregnancy website has information about support groups around the country.

Having to tell them what happened was so so hard, but their support has been immensely helpful. Hopefully your family has been supportive.

My wife and I’s first daughter was stillborn just past the due date. Day before the due date all looked good. Two days later, wife was worried because it felt “off” and there was no movement. It sucked. That was in 2012. We cut off friends with kids because we couldn’t be around kids. Couldn’t go to parties. Couldn’t even see kids at the zoo or movies or whatever.

Honestly, it took years for me to recover and be okay around kids without falling into a depression. Wife recovered faster, maybe only 3 years. Each person heals differently.

I can tell you that while most people will offer well meaning advise like “at least the passed before you could get to know them”, the thing that will forever haunt you is the “what if’s”. They will always be there.

That said, that deep hurt and emptiness you feel now will slowly get less deep, it will go from hurt to anger to sadness to an ache to a longing and eventually a bitter sweetness. It’s hard to explain, but you’ll understand in time.

Most people here will refer you to the grief analogy of waves. I’ve included it here. It is incredibly descriptive and accurate.



“As for grief, you’ll find it comes in waves. When the ship is first wrecked, you’re drowning, with wreckage all around you. Everything floating around you reminds you of the beauty and the magnificence of the ship that was, and is no more. And all you can do is float. You find some piece of the wreckage and you hang on for a while. Maybe it’s some physical thing. Maybe it’s a happy memory or a photograph. Maybe it’s a person who is also floating. For a while, all you can do is float. Stay alive.”

“In the beginning, the waves are 100 feet tall and crash over you without mercy,”  “They come 10 seconds apart and don’t even give you time to catch your breath. All you can do is hang on and float. After a while, maybe weeks, maybe months, you’ll find the waves are still 100 feet tall, but they come further apart. When they come, they still crash all over you and wipe you out. But in between, you can breathe, you can function. You never know what’s going to trigger the grief. It might be a song, a picture, a street intersection, the smell of a cup of coffee. It can be just about anything, and the wave comes crashing. But in between waves, there is life.”

“Somewhere down the line, and it’s different for everybody, you find that the waves are only 80 feet tall. Or 50 feet tall. And while they still come, they come further apart. You can see them coming. An anniversary, a birthday, or Christmas, or landing at O’Hare. You can see it coming, for the most part, and prepare yourself. And when it washes over you, you know that somehow you will, again, come out the other side. Soaking wet, sputtering, still hanging on to some tiny piece of the wreckage, but you’ll come out.”

“Take it from an old guy. The waves never stop coming, and somehow you don’t really want them to. But you learn that you’ll survive them. And other waves will come. And you’ll survive them too. If you’re lucky, you’ll have lots of scars from lots of loves. And lots of shipwrecks.",[],,t1_eztzgze,False,0,[],False,"<div class=""md""><p>It won’t be easy.

Now that we have two girls and aren&#39;t sure we&#39;re going around again, I have some regret not naming him properly. Mostly guilt that we didn&#39;t consider him to be a Fourth. It took us a while after his birth to give him his name, which was ultimately after the wood we used to hand-craft his memory box. Ultimately, I like the name we chose, so I dunno. I guess I&#39;m just sad about not being able to continue to husband&#39;s family&#39;s naming tradition.</p>

I had a similar story with my first loss. We saved for two years to go on our dream vacation - a cruise around the mediterranean. We found out a few weeks before the trip that I was pregnant, and told our families the week before we left - on my mother's birthday. We talked to my doctors who all encouraged us to go on the trip but take it easy. Three days into the trip, I started spotting. I went to an OB in Sicily to see what was going on and the baby was fine at that time - even heard the heartbeat. I was about 10 weeks at the time. We were elated. The next night, I started hemorrhaging blood. We went to the clinic on board the ship. I stayed there overnight and the next day had to go to the only medical facility in Mykonos to confirm I lost my baby. I was still hemorrhaging and losing so much blood, we had to charter a medically equipped airplane to take us to Athens for a D&C. We were able to change our flights and come home two days later. Our dream vacation turned into a total nightmare.

A loss is horrible in any circumstance, but when you couple it with something like a vacation, it's even worse. You mourn the loss of the baby, you mourn the vacation (yes there will always be more vacations, but this dream locale that people gush over are now associated with the worst moments of your life), you regret telling people, etc etc. There are so many mixed emotions. I think I cried myself to sleep ever night for at least a month.

This particular sub is the best club that no one wants to be in. I received so much support and strength when I was TTCafterloss and then when I had my successful pregnancy. I'm back again as we are looking to TTC#2 and I am super scared about it all.

Finally started having some brown bleeding this morning and nausea. I feel terrible for being excited to finally bleed because it means my miscarriage actually happened and we can’t start charting and planning for the future.  Here goes another emotional weekend.</p>

TTC keeps getting pushed back for one medical reason or another. While I’m impatient to have a baby, I’m also so relieved every time we postpone; it means I don’t have to make any hard choices, put myself out there, take risks, face the emotional storm of more loss and medical complications.

I have a suspicion that my own career worries are red herrings. Like it’s easier for me to worry about job sacrifices than to really connect with my fears about dying or losing another baby. That stuff can be too tough to really focus on so I assign my feelings to a more digestible source. Whoops.

 Anywho. I still find myself in career-baby/motherhood spirals pretty often. i calm down with this internal convo: “do I want a baby? Yes. More than anything else? Yes. More than professional success? Yes. Does my future family matter more to me than any external opinions and my responsibilities at work? Yes. Then stop putting carts before horses and cross those bridges when you get there.”

Also, I don’t know how panic-y you start feeling in your body, but I’ve really been helped by breathing exercises in the moment and find my days are generally more emotionally manageable when I take time for myself in the morning (leisurely coffee and dog walk with my husband).
