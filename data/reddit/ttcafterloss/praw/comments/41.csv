I'm definitely a fan of advocating for yourself. We actually went for tests around 7-8 months in and found a severe morphology issue.

I can definitely relate - I took a job almost four years ago that is 150 miles from our house because the health benefits for pregnancy, birth, and childcare would be incredible (all basically free). My job has me away from home three full days (like 6am to 10pm) with a period of time each year where I'm away one night and two full days. 

Now that we've been TTC for two years with nothing to show for it but loss and heartache... I started making phone calls/inquiries to adoption agencies, state and private.

Well, at true worst death but that's really really rare.).""

Originally when I looked at the images, I only saw abnormalities in an area where it doesn't matter as much, so I wanted to decline surgery. But he saw something in the body of the uterus, and I can kinda see it but I'm not quite convinced it's serious enough that my body won't resolve it by itself with time.

What I want to do right now is say fuck all this pregnancy stuff. I'm going to just forget everything and prevent until after my family trip to Paris in late September so I can actually enjoy my summer. Then I'll reassess and maybe try to use sick days during my medical fellowship to fly down to LA to do another surgery.


So my options:

1) Plan on surgery next menstrual cycle, either during my last week of residency or early in fellowship (sucks to need to be absent so early but life happens). I could also have planned to skip my family's trip this weekend and do it Friday, but it's our first family vacation of this sort and I've been looking forward to it.

2) Say fuck it and try to get pregnant and hope for the best. Reassess after a few months if not pregnant. If I lose my uterus, have only one kid or use a surrogate next.

3)  Use condoms/pull out until October after planned summer trips. Try to just enjoy life for a bit. Do another hsg to see how things look, then do last surgery. Will be 31 by then but 31 is not too old for wanting 2-3 kids. On the other hand, August will be real hard (would've been my twins one year birthday) to not be pregnant during but I need to make peace with time passing and my pregnancy journey being shit compared to people who can just get oops pregnant. 

4) Kinda like number 3, but start working on using a surrogate and give my body a much longer time to rest and heal and evaluate but still move forward with trying to have a baby. (My mother is pushing for this but I'm not ready yet. She's offered to pay so cost isn't the issue, but I have to go out of state for surrogacy which complicates matters).

Sometimes I have a difficult time with the situations where there are moms who did a bunch of drugs while pregnant, and while I try not to judge, there are some moms who just don't want their baby. Or they just don't care. And it makes me so frustrated. And I decided that instead of going crazy about it, I would just love those babies extra. Because they usually need more snuggles anyways. 
I appreciate your reply to my comment and thank you for validating my frustrations. I feel kind of selfish sometimes but I feel like in order to work where I do, it needs to be a safe place for me. And there are always unavoidable things, but that situation with that nurse was completely avoidable and uncalled for. And it brought in a parent who has enough to deal with then to be dragged into my sorry mess.

Since they found what they found (that the dye collects a bit at the ends of my tubes near my ovaries) though, I'll admit I'm of two minds: 1) there's a part of me still hoping the HSG will increase my fertility and I'll be that obnoxious ""omg it happened for me"" type poster that I've rolled my eyes at :) and 2) there's a part of me scared that if the HSG does increase my fertility what they found (that fluid does not flow easily or totally through the tubes and may ""reflux"" into the uterus, for lack of a better term) increases my risk for miscarriage. 

Edited to add - the only thing that bugs me about that article is someone is quoted as saying ""Why don't couples explore HSG before IVF? - they could save tons of money!"" But the thing is, it's pretty much standard to get an HSG during fertility testing once you go to an RE (I don't know of any who don't use it as a diagnostic tool: for example an RE who would go straight to recommending IUIs without ordering an HSG for example, is being a dumbass because if your tubes are closed up, they're closed up and you can't trigger an egg through a blocked tunnel). . So it's not like an either/or. 

Maybe the person quoted was more getting at - perhaps REs should give patients oil-based HSGs and have women who have a normal HSG (and therefore unexplained infertility if nothing else has come up) wait a couple of cycles before they move to medicated fertility treatments to see if the ""HSG effect"" occurs.

It was a year ago to the day that I woke up on a Monday morning and - after 11 months of trying - saw something I had never seen before. Five tests later, my husband and I were in the stratosphere and climbing ever higher each day with excitement. For us the crash was fast - just a little over two weeks later we were clutching each other in the bathroom looking at the unfathomable. 

I'm going to spend some time this week reflecting on what this past year has meant and how it has changed me - I think I focus more sometimes on how much I'm changed for ""the worst"" (I will never have a ""fun and easy"" pg, shit I may never have a pg; I will remain disappointed by family and friends who don't know how to relate to me/people with infertility), but I also believe that my heart and capacity for compassion has grown this year. I feel like I see those who struggle hard for anything they deeply hope for and care about with more clarity and understanding. I'm grateful that this experience has somehow stitched my husband and I together even closer, even if we aren't always at the same place or mood in our grief. 

I have to do this because otherwise when I start trying to think about the last year it can be too easy to feel like it's this black hole that just sucked me in and left me with nothing and nowhere closer to where I want to be. 

Finding this board last summer and everyone I've talked to on here has helped me get to this place, and I'm so grateful for it. I sincerely believe my mental health would not be where it is right now without being able to have this space.

I did have a truly horrible leg cramp last night, worst by far and lasted a while. Walking around was the only thing that helped. Need to up my magnesium and potassium and do more stretching before bed. Oof it was a rough one.

I thought I'd conceive again quickly like I did the first time, but it hasn't happened yet. Sometimes I feel really sad and anxious about that, especially as my due date approaches. But other times, I really feel very relieved it hasn't happened yet. My body needed a break from being pregnant. I needed to exercise, eat well, drink some red wine, and find happiness within myself again. I'm finally there, most of the time. If I get pregnant this cycle, it will be without fear that my body wasn't ready, and without feeling like I didn't get a breather in between. 

So, I don't have great advice... Try when you want to, and it might happen or it might not. But it is not the only way you can feel happy again. I promise.

One thing I have to think about soonish is where to deliver (it's still hard to think that will happen!).

Then as long as you are low risk the day of delivery you can choose a midwife or Doctor assisted birth.

(Trigger warning: living child, talk of death)

So last night my son, who is 2.75 (sorry) suddenly said (in a happy voice) ""and then I will kill you!"". Several times. Which I immediately shut down. We watched a questionably aged movie for him (Kubo and the two strings) and there was a lot of talk about killing, and he is in a phase of pretending to play dead and whatnot. But the way he kept saying that I wasn't going to let fly, soooo... right before bed time I explained to him about how that made me so sad because killing meant you die (which is doesn't understand the gravity of yet). So then I explained that meant you stop working and never ever ever come back. And I couldn't hug him or play with him or love him any more. He said then I could go to the hospital and get fixed and I said ""not if I am killed"" and he said ""but you can get healed!"" (Thanks zelda🙄) and I said ""you can never get healed if you died.."" 

... and you guys his poor little soul was crushed. Just the saddest face with tears brimming and he just said ""I am sad."" And hugged me for like 5 real minutes. My husband said he had a horrified look on his face the whole time. Then we hugged and agreed we wouldn't say that anymore, and tickled and read books and went to bed happy.

So there, I've stolen my son's innocence and crushed his little soul a little bit. And now it's 1:57 and he's woken up crying twice now just saying he's sad. 😭 And as I wrote that he started crying in his sleep but went back to sleep on his own.

I ruined my poor sweet guy! 😭😭😭 

Anyway, at least I got to pee so maybe tomorrow morning I won't wake up due to dreams of wetting the bed. 

Edit to add: also yesterday he said my legs have whiskers.. so I guess it's time to suck it up with the nausea and shave. 😂

It did take 3 cycles to get pregnant again.   Each period was rough to be honest.   But long story short, I just gave birth to my rainbow baby 1 week ago.

Please know you didn't do anything wrong.

Be prepared that it might sneak up on you and impact you in different ways than you expected. 

I had a D&C for the first and naturally miscarried the second. I only bled lightly for 3 days due to reabsorption so my advice probably isn't the most useful. My second loss was at 5+5 and my doctor said we could try again right away and prescribed me femara to take that day. 

I personally do want to try again, but I think it's important to take into consideration your own feelings and mental health. If trying again (especially right away) is going to be too hard on you, it's okay to take a break. You don't have to make any big, permanent decisions right away.

Lovely crying spell yesterday evening. In the end, the husband distracted me and then we watched Phantastic Beasts and Where To Find Them, which was nice. However, I really need to talk about why I'm so down and I don't even know where to start. I think he thinks it's mainly the physical problems, but those are just the beginning. 

Rant incoming. 

I feel like there's so much to do, that we are unprepared and not getting stuff done. I mainly sit around on my ass all day and he works and takes care of the garden. Germany is having a midwife shortage, so we don't have one - they were mostly fully booked by January, but it's not like we even really tried to find someone. He promised he'd call around for one in March and never did. 

So we have no midwife to check up on me after birth (you can have one come over 14 times after birth in Germany - they answer questions, help with the newborn and your recovery), no birth course, no newborn course to go to. 

Progress on the nursery has completely stalled. The car needs summer tyres and an inspection. The windows need cleaning. And lots of other stuff. 

And now my in-laws are coming on Sunday. My in-laws, who we will see at a family wedding next week anyway. And so Saturday will probably be spent making the house look presentable again instead of things we actually need to do. Because of course we need everything to look good for them. Because they are guests. 

When the fuck do people start coming to see us and help with shit instead of coming to see us and be entertained by us? I really thought people would start offering at one point, but it's just not happening. Even though everyone knows I can barely move. 

End Rant

Unfortunately, that differs for every person and every pregnancy. Even losses at the same gestation could have different hcg levels and could fall at different rates. 

I'd suggest tracking with a home pregnancy test maybe once a week until you get a negative. 

Also, you can ovulate with hcg still in your body, so if you want to track your cycle you don't have to wait. Now, many people have messed up cycles after a loss so don't put too much stock in your cycle returning to normal too quickly. (But OPKS register HCG so youd likely need to temp)

There isn't a clear sign between grief and depression, but that doesn't mean that it shouldn't or can't be treated. If you're suffering, it doesn't really matter what the exact diagnosis is. There are options for help. Pregnancy and Infant loss unfortunately have not been studied in specific enough detail, but as the first link below shows, even early miscarriages can have a long standing impact on someone's mental health, so I am very quick to encourage that people at the very least engage in therapy after any sort of loss if they feel like they are having a hard time coping on their own. I just happened to be in therapy (requirement for my training) during my loss, and I'm so grateful that I was because I admit I might not have prioritized finding someone because I'm terrible about asking for help.

We don't have great data about whether or not medications are helpful for grief, but I think that there is often little harm in giving them a try, especially if you're already in therapy and still feel like making it through this is harder than it could be.

I&#39;ve found myself in a similar situation. Unlike the other reply, my doctors (I consulted two) were very unwilling to test for anything after two losses. Granted, one was a MMC at 11.5 weeks and one was basically a chemical pregnancy, so they were two pretty different scenarios. They hesitantly agreed to write an Rx for a few simple blood tests, but they strongly recommended I try again before undergoing any testing.

My last obgyn just put me on preventative antibiotics and then I never dealt with it again but that doc moved and my new doc doesn&#39;t want to over treat me, which I get, but seriously...

First and only pregnancy. They told me to be there at 10:15, procedure was at 12:15. DH was allowed to be with me up until surgery and then while I was coming out of anesthesia. It's not long; only about half an hour if being alone. And you are pretty much unaware. 

No food or drink after midnight, which is standard. I didn't take any pills beforehand. Just the IV. 

What caught me off guard was paperwork. They usually will not ask you about the remains. We could not bear to have our baby classified as ""medical waste"" even at 9.5 weeks. We decided we wanted to take him home. Unfortunately, in a lot of hospitals, that's not allowed. First you have to ask for forms to say they cannot dispose of what comes out of the D&C. For mine I had to list a funeral home for remains to be released to. I had no idea and just put a local one. It was kind of a hassle because then pastoral staff saw the forms and wanted to talk to me about ""options"". That experience sucked because we knew we wanted him home and Pele were trying to convince us otherwise. 

We did get him home through the funeral home. But we had to sign a fetal death certificate. We had him cremated, and we plan on making his ashes into a peek-a-boo diamond from LifeGem to put in our wedding ring. The funeral director also offered to attempt to take his fingerprint, if he had one. These little things meant so much to us. We really felt much better knowing he would be back with us. But everyone is different and I knew I was pregnant from 10dpo.

As far as my body goes, I'm still bleeding. It's pretty normal, I hear. It's just like a period. But I had some clots, which were painful to pass. I had a few ""contractions"" and they stopped when a big clot came out. (Sorry, TMI) Otherwise, I've had no issues besides feeling tender down there and disgruntled about no sex. 

If I had to do it over again, I would pick D&C over the meds all day long. Seriously, I was so scared to pass the baby. (I had a MMC, and it was not starting on its own.) D&C just made it so much easier to heal mentally.

All your questions are valid and normal responses. It's so hard not to worry about the future when you are forced to realize you have no control. 🙁

If you aren't scheduled for one I might suggest waiting it out or taking the pills. While a D&amp;C ends the whole ordeal very quickly, it is not without risks.

Sorry for your loss. I wish I had more guidance with this as well when I had my loss at 23 weeks. So hopefully I can help you. I am in Illinois. 

We called a funeral home near by. The hospital provided us a list of places they usually deal with, so the funeral home director already knows who/which department to contact for the pick up. We then visited the funeral home after discharge to sign paperwork for authorization of cremation. There is usually a cost associated with the pick up and cremation service. You will also have to choose an urn (whether online or at the funeral home). Since the baby is so small, we chose a keepsake urn (cheaper option) at the funeral home (also don't have to wait for an online order to come in and having to bring it back to the funeral home). It took about 5-7 days before we were notified by the funeral director that the ashes were ready for pick up. 

Then it's up to you what you want to do with the ashes. We chose to have it stored at a niche, instead of a ground burial. Your funeral home should be able to provide you with some options close by. We found out that catholic cemeteries are much cheaper than ""chain/corporate"" cemeteries. If you choose to do the niche, everything is included in the total cost (opening/closing of the box/niche, name plaque, small service). If you chose ground burial, tombstone will need to be ordered from a monument store (usually separate from the cemetery). There are burial grounds specific for infants/stillborns.

So it led them to thinking it was a placental abruption at first, and instead of me actually bleeding as a warning sign it pooled behind the placenta. But when my OB spoke to a high risk doctor I went to for a second opinion, she was skeptical and thought that everything looked fine enough where it may not have been an abruption, maybe a ""cord accident."" So, those were the two clues they found. 

You didn't do anything wrong! Please don't think that. I know it's hard because you are your son's mother, and he was in your body. I know. I still have trouble with the guilty feelings, with thinking ""why shouldn't I blame myself?"" But, you had no say in this, if it was up to you, you would always choose to keep your son safe. You would never wish harm upon him. You loved him and did the best you could from the very first day you found out you were pregnant. You mention you did everything right, took great care of yourself the whole pregnancy. Then this was out of your hands, and you had absolutely no control over what happened to your son. 

Something I've thought recently was: If the doctors didn't know anything was wrong, how could I have known? If these OBs with their degrees and expertise on pregnancies and childbirth had no idea that your son was in distress, how would you expect to know? You shouldn't beat yourself up....it's hard not to. But you shouldn't. Honestly, I don't want to make myself suffer more than I have to, and neither should you. 

But I still blame myself, of course....I think of little things I did and wonder if they were the reason my son passed, too. I had a flu shot two days before my son was stillborn and I STILL sometimes think that was the reason he died, although doctors point to the possibility of it being due to the blood clot, and the lack of oxygen my son had in utero. But I still blame the flu shot, or I still stubbornly think that maybe I slept wrong, when the other 38 weeks of pregnancy I was treating my son just perfectly fine! And you were treating your son perfectly, too, I know it. Nothing you did harmed him at all. 

I see a therapist once a week. She was a real lifesaver for me. She reminds me to think logically and rationally about all of this, and is guiding me to truly see that things in life are out of our control, and sometimes they just go horribly wrong without warning. But she told me to think of my son's loss in terms of ""before"" and ""After."" Before my son was stillborn, I knew set facts that would never lead me to think he was in distress, and facts that would never lead me to blaming myself. The doctors told me every checkup I had was perfect, he had the perfect heart rate, the midwife told me I'd have him in my arms in a week, I never had complications, every time I went to L&D out of worry they promptly sent me away. Then my son suddenly died, and I started to think that I somehow knew he was in danger and I needed to be induced. It was my emotions talking, my guilt that only us mothers can feel. It was the love talking, the need to blame someone and feel in control of this horrible tragedy. But it didn't make rational sense to blame myself, because I knew what I knew at the time, I knew only what the doctors told me, and there was never any indication anything was wrong. It sounds like from your experience, nothing could have led you to believe your son would be stillborn, either.

But when my OB spoke to a high risk doctor I went to for a second opinion, she was skeptical and thought that everything looked fine enough where it may not have been an abruption, maybe a &quot;cord accident.&quot; So, those were the two clues they found. </p>

<p>You didn&#39;t do anything wrong! Please don&#39;t think that. I know it&#39;s hard because you are your son&#39;s mother, and he was in your body. I know. I still have trouble with the guilty feelings, with thinking &quot;why shouldn&#39;t I blame myself?&quot; But, you had no say in this, if it was up to you, you would always choose to keep your son safe. You would never wish harm upon him. You loved him and did the best you could from the very first day you found out you were pregnant. You mention you did everything right, took great care of yourself the whole pregnancy. Then this was out of your hands, and you had absolutely no control over what happened to your son. </p>

<p>Something I&#39;ve thought recently was: If the doctors didn&#39;t know anything was wrong, how could I have known? If these OBs with their degrees and expertise on pregnancies and childbirth had no idea that your son was in distress, how would you expect to know? You shouldn&#39;t beat yourself up....it&#39;s hard not to. But you shouldn&#39;t. Honestly, I don&#39;t want to make myself suffer more than I have to, and neither should you. </p>

<p>But I still blame myself, of course....I think of little things I did and wonder if they were the reason my son passed, too. I had a flu shot two days before my son was stillborn and I STILL sometimes think that was the reason he died, although doctors point to the possibility of it being due to the blood clot, and the lack of oxygen my son had in utero. But I still blame the flu shot, or I still stubbornly think that maybe I slept wrong, when the other 38 weeks of pregnancy I was treating my son just perfectly fine! And you were treating your son perfectly, too, I know it. Nothing you did harmed him at all. </p>

<p>I see a therapist once a week. She was a real lifesaver for me. She reminds me to think logically and rationally about all of this, and is guiding me to truly see that things in life are out of our control, and sometimes they just go horribly wrong without warning. But she told me to think of my son&#39;s loss in terms of &quot;before&quot; and &quot;After.&quot; Before my son was stillborn, I knew set facts that would never lead me to think he was in distress, and facts that would never lead me to blaming myself. The doctors told me every checkup I had was perfect, he had the perfect heart rate, the midwife told me I&#39;d have him in my arms in a week, I never had complications, every time I went to L&amp;D out of worry they promptly sent me away. Then my son suddenly died, and I started to think that I somehow knew he was in danger and I needed to be induced. It was my emotions talking, my guilt that only us mothers can feel. It was the love talking, the need to blame someone and feel in control of this horrible tragedy. But it didn&#39;t make rational sense to blame myself, because I knew what I knew at the time, I knew only what the doctors told me, and there was never any indication anything was wrong. It sounds like from your experience, nothing could have led you to believe your son would be stillborn, either. If they kept saying he was fine, you had no reason to think otherwise, and this was truly out of your hands &lt;3 Please be kind to yourself &lt;3 </p>

Your pain is so raw right now, cry as much as you'd like but take it easy on yourself.

My son's stillbirth has more questions than answers too, but there were a few clues here and there, although they didn't add up to a solid reason as to why he died. 

This subreddit has really, really supported me the past six months. I hope it will be helpful for you, too. There are many moms like you who have also had full term losses. The pain isn't going to go away completely, but you are going to feel less raw eventually. But let yourself grieve. Don't be afraid to ask people for support, even just a shoulder to lean on and cry.

Good morning ladies! I know most of you are well into your day but it's morning here in Cali! 

I told my husband all I wanted for Mother's Day yesterday was a productive day - I just want my house clean and I feel like no matter what I do I can't get it clean enough. I went through a ridiculous amount of my sons clothes from when he was a baby/toddler and I was actually able to keep a good portion of it for baby girl. A lot of his shirts she could totally wear and most of his shoes were converse or keds. The rest I'm giving to friends, his preschool or donating to the Salvation Army. It's nice to clean out our storage a little. I had all the boxes piled up where baby is going to be set up so it'll be nice to get that area cleaned and prepped so she has a place to sleep. All in all, a quiet Mother's Day for me, which is exactly my style.  

Baby is getting stronger and stronger in there and has been down in my pelvis/hips again, making everything hurt. My hips have widened quite a bit, which my husband commented yesterday he likes (nice perk), so I think it's just my body getting ready. This pregnancy is so different than my son's was and I'm trying to just enjoy every second of it. I love watching my belly move from the outside and my husband enjoys it too. 

For all you ladies with scheduled C-sections, when did you book it?

<p>29+6</p>

<p>Good morning ladies! I know most of you are well into your day but it&#39;s morning here in Cali! </p>

<p>I told my husband all I wanted for Mother&#39;s Day yesterday was a productive day - I just want my house clean and I feel like no matter what I do I can&#39;t get it clean enough. I went through a ridiculous amount of my sons clothes from when he was a baby/toddler and I was actually able to keep a good portion of it for baby girl. A lot of his shirts she could totally wear and most of his shoes were converse or keds. The rest I&#39;m giving to friends, his preschool or donating to the Salvation Army. It&#39;s nice to clean out our storage a little. I had all the boxes piled up where baby is going to be set up so it&#39;ll be nice to get that area cleaned and prepped so she has a place to sleep. All in all, a quiet Mother&#39;s Day for me, which is exactly my style.  </p>

<p>Baby is getting stronger and stronger in there and has been down in my pelvis/hips again, making everything hurt. My hips have widened quite a bit, which my husband commented yesterday he likes (nice perk), so I think it&#39;s just my body getting ready. This pregnancy is so different than my son&#39;s was and I&#39;m trying to just enjoy every second of it. I love watching my belly move from the outside and my husband enjoys it too. </p>

<p>For all you ladies with scheduled C-sections, when did you book it? I&#39;m trying for a VBAC this time, and my doc said she would schedule a C-section at 39 weeks and if I go into labor before then I can try for the vbac. I would like to get it scheduled asap so I can plan when to take off work, get my replacement up and running, etc. I didn&#39;t take as much time last pregnancy and I regret it.

<p>This cousin lives in Florida but she&#39;s actually coming into town this weekend for my other cousins wedding so, I&#39;m about to be in the thick of everyone congratulating her, asking how she&#39;s feeling, whether she wants a boy or a girl and that should have been me. </p>

I&#39;ve always thought of an MMC as being one where you see a live baby and then somewhere between scans, it passes, but isn&#39;t caught until the next scan. I know this isn&#39;t accurate though...so I guess I have had a MMC and just not really thought of it that way. </p>

<p>A lot of it must be doctors, and patients, not labelling them right. But I imagine many women miscarry and haven&#39;t had an ultrasound yet so have no clue if the fetus is the correct gestational age or not, so it falls under the umbrella of &quot;miscarriage&quot; which is pretty much all-encompassing.</p>

Please feel free to re-post in Alumni - its also full of women who are supportive and have gone through loss. </p>

<p>Please message the moderators if you have any additional questions or concerns.</p>

So the procedure was a relief at that point—I just wanted it over. They put me to sleep and gave me anti-anxiety meds. I think I was home by 1 PM and got to the hospital at 7 am?

I&#39;m really lucky that I work in healthcare and the average person kinda &quot;gets&quot; it more than in a lot of other settings. Particularly when my loss was a termination. I&#39;m glad I can just be open about it, complain about how I was treated by our sister hospital (Catholic, while ours is secular) and move on. </p>

Starting to regret having told people. Especially my sister and one friend. I keep getting annoying texts about being ""knocked up"" and weird wink-wink tweets on twitter.

Feeling very glad about my decision to not go wider than parents/siblings/close friends although I wish I could go back on a few of those now. 

Pretty sure I won't tell the rest of my family until AT LEAST July 4th. That's probably the next time I see them and depending on how much I'm showing, maybe not even then. 

On the plus side, I leave for vacation tonight - Athens, Iceland, and Rome with overnight layovers in Frankfurt, Oslo and a mid-day layover in Brussels.

I write things down all the time that I want my doctor to check for whenever I get back to trying again. I don't think you're crazy, and I'm pretty sure it's normal.

I want miscarriages, stillbirths and the like to be more thoroughly researched and become less common. I can't believe how much mystery is still around this stuff. But if you can't seem to find the answer you're looking for, don't beat yourself up. I'm not saying it's impossible for you to find something, but I don't want you to feel bad for not being able to find out what apparently plenty of doctors haven't been able to find out for so many years. 

I'm not quite sure if I'd even call this morbid. He was your baby, and losing him for seemingly no reason is horrible. And, even having a reason wouldn't be much comfort. If they're willing to go over it with you again, I would say why not. Do what you need to do. Are you thinking maybe you have an unhealthy obsession? From what I've read, it seems normal, and I would think you have all the reason in the world to look for a concrete answer. I'm in a similar boat, except I don't have an autopsy report to look over or really any kind of hints.

After my MMC (HB seen at earlier ultrasound, not on a follow up), I was devastated. We had been trying for the better part of a year. I am not prone to depression, but I definitely slipped into one. I had my D&C in late June, spent a few months only getting out of bed to eat (gained weight!) and to go to work. Knitted myself a sad hat. Cried A LOT. Finally went to therapy in October. Fell pregnant just as I was getting over (as much as one can) the loss - tested positive in mid-January right around my 37 birthday. My daughter is simply amazing, and she was my saving grace through a recent loss at 16 weeks.

So my tip is to give your grief its due, but seek help if you suspect you need it. My experience is that I cannot conceive under the weight of stress, anxiety, or depression. Now I've read of plenty of folks who can and did conceive directly after a loss, but not one of them that I can remember hasn't said ""I wish I would have waited."" Those folks certainly don't regret the baby, but there was a 'I wished I would have given myself the time to properly grieve that very real loss' theme. Also, you are relatively young, so if there is a underlying fertility issue (possible but unlikely), you have the time to go that route if things don't go your way in the near future - It's not like giving yourself a few months is going to wreck your dreams of a baby.

It's been a week. Had my first therapy sesh since surgery on Friday. I cried like a baby, but it was really good.

The fertility centre also requested a copy of my OR report, to make sure that I actually don't have tubes, I guess? I dunno. So I went and tracked that down and sent it to them. It's pretty metal. I keep re-reading it. There's something grimly fascinating about reading what went on while you were anaesthetized. It makes me a little queasy, too. 

Also, I stopped birth control at some point over a week ago, and my period hasn't shown up. I don't really care. Would just be nice to know when to expect to start bleeding. I'm flying totally blind at this point. At least my spotting has stopped, which is what I was really hoping for, so that's nice. Was bleeding in some manner or another for a good 2 months. Yech. 

Also, beta is finally negative. No more weekly blood work. I'm really thankful for that. 

Anyway, that's a lot of also's. But that's what's been going on with me.

<p>I want the day to myself and to have Jeffrey there but I&#39;m also scared and worried to keep him to myself if he wants to spend time with his mom. I couldn&#39;t go out for a meal any time that day because I feel such a disconnect with people who are too happy. It makes me feel like an alien. </p>

<p>I also feel so defensive about people who may not see me as a mom because I parent Julia differently. People never really acknowledge Julia and now they&#39;re not acknowledging me as a parent.

Haven&#39;t been great about making time for reading, but my husband is actually out of the house this evening (rarely happens!) so I might have a solo book date with the couch. =D </p>

I know how you feel. My grief comes in waves like this, I usually am ""okay"" and ""fine"" but I have random triggers that send me falling apart and feeling intense pain and sorrow.

I was looking forward to him learning how to play baseball and soccer from his dad. Knowing this won't happen anymore just kills me. 

Grief is definitely NOT linear...it comes and goes. I felt that way with my fathers death but especially more intensely with my son's. The stages are sloppy, sometimes we skip whole stages and come back to another stage repetitively. I went from Denial to Anger, to Depression, back to Anger, and now I'm back to the Depression phase again with some Bargaining. Sometimes I think I'm at Acceptance!--then I go all the way backwards. It's okay. 

Our losses were extremely hard. I've been taking some time to really admire how strong I am, especially on very down days. I know it's hard to see that because of how painful it is to not have Raff with you. But you should give yourself so much credit. You're living, breathing, and going about your day. That's a HUGE accomplishment right now. Be proud of yourself, you are an amazing mother with so much love for Raffael, it really shines through in your post and how much you miss him.

I hate getting advice from other people, too....I really just want a pair of arms to hold me while I cry. I'm sick of people telling me to be strong or suck it up, or things will be okay. No, they're not okay. Maybe one day they will be, but not now. That's simply not where we are right now and that's fine. I hate the advice no matter how well meaning it is, because these people have not felt our pain! So STFU.

I understand the shock of it all because something very similar happened to us. We found out our baby's heart had stopped at our third ultrasound at 9.5 weeks. She had had a perfect heartbeat and everything had been looking great. We even got to see her individual fingers and little nose at the 8.5 week ultrasound. Tomorrow will be exactly two months since that day and it feels like a lifetime has passed since then. It took us ten months and fertility treatments to get pregnant the first time. 

Physically, for me, getting ready to TTC again was surprisingly easy. Two weeks after the D&C, I had a followup. I had stopped spotting a day or so before the appointment, and the doctor didn't even do an exam since everything seemed to be going well. Four weeks after the D&C I scheduled a meeting with our fertility doctor to discuss our plan. The consulting nurse wanted me to wait 6 weeks, but we had some vacations coming up and I wanted to plan around them. The doctor ended up doing an ultrasound at that appointment and my uterus had gone completely back to normal, my ovaries looked fine, albeit polycystic as always (I have PCOS), and I had a thin lining. Because the lining was thin, the doctor said I could start letrazole immediately to help get a mature egg. It took a few days longer than normal to kick my ovaries into gear, but we got a mature follicle on CD15, had a nice thick lining, and did an insemination. In the next few days I should be able to test or my period will start if it wasn't successful. I know the question of when we would be able to start again was a huge worry for me after the miscarriage and especially worrying whether or not it would be better for the next pregnancy to wait longer. Our doctor said there was no increased risk of trying right away, and by every metric we looked at, my body was ready, even though I didn't wait a cycle and have a period. 

As other people have said, trying to heal emotionally and prepare yourself mentally is the bigger part of getting ready to TTC. Something terrible happened to you. You lost a child. You need to heal. Its hard enough and frustrating enough dealing with the disappointing cycles the first time when you're full of hope and optimism. For me, it was important to go into that battle the second time with scars, not open wounds, so I let myself grieve and to be honest, it was ugly and terrible and consuming. I talked to a therapist and I was kind and patient with myself. I didn't beat myself up for getting mad at people or not talking to people who couldn't say the right things even though they meant well. If I couldn't get out of bed, I didn't. I cried when I needed to and I reached out to my partner. 

While I let myself grieve completely, I also tried to look out for my future. I made plans. I signed up for a korean class, something I'd always wanted to do. I also signed up for a 10k - knowing that for me, the exercise during training would help to lift me out of depression. I also continued to be kind to myself and tried to give my heart and my grief what they needed to heal. I named my daughter Opal since she was due in October and bought a small opal ring that I could wear, so even after the D&C, she would still be with me. We had been holding off on decorating the nursery, but after she died, the emptiness of that room felt like a hole in my heart. So I decorated it. I know that its frivolous, especially when we don't have a baby yet, but my husband was able to handle the miscarriage because he could still picture a future with a child. To him, this was a only a delay. Me, on the otherhand - I couldn't even see that future. I needed something tangible to remember my lost child and I need something tangible to hold onto my hope for a future child. 

It still hurts, and I still grieve but it doesn't consume me and its manageable. I don't blame myself for anything anymore. At first I was consumed with thoughts of things I might have done or things I could have done. Forgiving myself, recognizing that it wasn't my fault and that bad things just happen, and finding a healthy grief is allowing me to go into the next pregnancy with a clear conscience and less anxiety. I still go in the nursery and cry when I feel sad. My husband has a windup stuffed dog that plays ""how much is that doggy in the window"" from when he was a baby. When I'm sad, I wind it up and I cry and I repeat that maybe 3-4 times saying in Korean each time, ""one more time"", heh, but then I'm done and I can let it go and keep going with my day. 

Again I'm sorry that you have go through this, but be kind to yourself, reach out for help when you need it, find a way to hold onto both your child and the future, and I promise, even though this grief will always be a part of you, someday it will be more manageable.

I went in for a scan in the afternoon, and had serious ""this is over"" fear and bad ultrasound flashbacks in the waiting room.

Thanks?), twanding it was. HR 170, and I heard it for the first time. Such a relief. I didn't think to ask what I was measuring because I was trying not to hyperventilate. Blob has transformed to an actual humanoid armadillo-looking creature that was *moving.* Ohhhh the tears of relief, especially after bickering all morning with my husband because I was so stressed and short-tempered. Then I felt like a fucking psycho for losing my cool to such an extent.

The same exact thing happened to me a month ago. I measured 6w3d at my 7 week ultrasound (first pregnancy), and the same a week later at 8 weeks.

I opted for the D&C because it had already been 2 weeks and nothing was happening naturally, and honestly, with my school/work schedule, it was easier to just take the day off and know when it was going to happen. My cervix showed no signs of opening, so they did give me cytotec to take 12 hours before the procedure, and it was awful. I will never forget how awful that night was. The procedure itself was uneventful. They gave me general anesthesia, so I was a bit groggy after. I bled and had bad period-like cramps for about 10 days afterward, which I just took ibuprofen and used heating pads for. 

I'd ask for a referral to a reproductive endocrinologist and/or genetic counselor. I'd also ask if it's possible to send a tissue sample to pathology (they may not be able to if it hasn't been viable for ~3 weeks already—they couldn't with mine). They'll want to schedule a follow-up with you in a week or two just to make sure everything is healing all right. 

My OB said I could start TTC as soon as I had a period, but I'm still waiting for that. It's been 33 days and I was usually 27-28 days regular. I've heard wonky cycles aren't unusual after a MMC/D&C.

There is a recent episode of the advice podcast Dear Sugar that deals with making the decision to have kids or not, and one letter writer has had multiple losses and so it might be of interest to you (though maybe the other letter will be triggering since it is a couple trying to get on the same page without loss or infertility, just timing and geography).   It might not be 100% applicable but maybe helpful to hear others talk through the process.  <a href=""http://www.wbur.org/dearsugar/2017/03/24/dear-sugar-episode-eighty-nine"">http://www.wbur.org/dearsugar/2017/03/24/dear-sugar-episode-eighty-nine</a></p>

At my 6+4 scan (omg the heartbeat. Tears!) my RE's office said I could graduate to an OB. I was like ummmm that's early. Also, all the nurses were congratulating me tons… I know they are used to women who cannot get pregnant there. But it's very hard to hear all the happy congratulations when I have a history of loss. 

Anyway, I talked to my OB and they were also confused why I would go there so soon… and talked about not having a scan til week 9 or 10. Then not til the anatomy scan. I was like ummm no. So I messaged my actual RE (who I hadn't seen that day) and told him I wasn't comfortable with that since I've lost babies in week 7 and week 10. He replied that it was because of insurance purposes and that if I didn't mind paying out-of-pocket, or if my insurance would cover more ultrasounds, that they'd love to keep seeing me. My insurance covers ultrasounds 100% with no max amount of them… So I'm staying at the RE for now! Woo. 

But I'm interviewing for jobs AND going to be out of town quite a bit. So my next scan is still 8 days away from now. I could definitely call and get in this week, but then I feel crazy. Haha I might still go in if I feel the need. 😎 but I have a very important 4th round job interview on the 15th… So I decided to make my next u/s the day after that. Ignorance is bliss, right?

(Nobody knew we were even TTC). First we told MIL and that was amazing - I told DH to record it and it was the best decision ever! DH told her: ""So.. something weird is happening with bloomng."" MIL: ""Yeah... what?"" DH: ""She has.. 20 fingers,"" MIL: ""What?"" and she looks at her hands and is like: ""Well I have 20 too.. wait, no.. what?"" and then... her eyes light up, her mouth drops open, and it's just amazing! She goes: ""no!!? Really??"" We nod our heads. She tears up, I tear up, DH tears up! It was just absolutely the best. She was so thrilled and so happy and she kept saying she's in shock and can't believe it and it's time for her to start knitting. It was awesome. 

Warning: quite a rant coming up about a bad reaction from DH's sibling:

Then it was DH's brother's and SIL turn and that was less amazing. They totally didn't get it at first. DH asked them how do they think their kids would feel about having a cousin and it took them forever, then they said: ""you're adopting?"" And then DH finally had to spell it out: ""no, bloomng is pregnant,"" they were like: really? For real? They definitely expressed happiness and how cool that is.. but then came the cliche: ""You're life is over! har har. You'll never sleep again! You won't see any of your friends anymore. There's gonna be poop everywhere. 18 years until you're free again! Everything will be about the kid. You're life is no longer yours. You won't be able to do any of your hobbies anymore. You'll have to plan everything and you'll never do anything spontaneous and fun."" etc. Like they went on like this for 15-20 minutes - I'm not joking, I didn't even know one could go on for that long repeating the same bullshit! It was so much negativity. DH was like: ""Well, the good thing is that we have friends who are having babies around the same time,"" BIL and SIL: ""Oh, well you'll never see them again, and if you do you'll hate their kids."" 
That's not even the worst part of it. Then they're like: ""oh, it must have been an 'exciting' shock for you,"" and DH and I are like looking at each other and respond: ""well, no.. we planned it and we're extremely happy about it and definitely hoped for it."" Then, what pissed me off the post, SIL says: ""Oh, how did it happen? I thought you couldn't have kids,"" and again, DH and I are like: ""ermm no, why would you think that?"" ""Oh, I don't know, I just thought that."" This bothered me the most because 1. that's extremely judgmental and closed-minded.. just cause we chose to focus on work and financial stability doesn't mean we couldn't have children; it's a legitimate choice many people make, emphasis on choice, and 2) if that was true, how extremely hurtful would that comment be? Like: ""oh yeah, thanks for bringing it up, so let me tell you about all the treatments we went through, the money we spend, all the heartache we endured, and oh thanks for bringing this up now. I was so happy they didn't know about the miscarriage - I can't even imagine what insensitive comment would they make about it. Oh, and they were also like: ""well, now you'll have to decide what school the kid goes to, etc. Now you will see if you have the same values or not."" Like... hmmm oh yeah cause for 15 years we've been together our values have never come up.. we totally don't know what they are. 

Now, I'm not naive or anything. I know our lives will change - and it's a change we welcome. And of course, there might be negative things, like sleepless nights, and sometimes for sure we'll have to give something up that otherwise we wouldn't have to - but to say you're life will end and all the other bullshit is just plainly untrue. We have a friend who lives really close by and she is super happy with her kids and does lots of activities with them and without them. Last thanksgiving they came over with their 2 year old toddler and a 1 month newborn and we all had a blast, they stayed till midnight, and surprise, surprise, I didn't hate their kids. She also didn't give up her hobbies.

I know they were just probably projecting their own feelings and stuff, but still I was so upset and I didn't think it was funny at all. I could also see that it made DH more anxious even though he laughed it off.

It&#39;ll never be the same as when we told everyone the first time, but it&#39;s nice to be surrounded by people who will (and have!) supported us through the highs and the lows. Tonight we&#39;re telling my parents. 🙂</p>

However, as far as I understood, the journal wasn&#39;t intended exclusively for people on this sub. Furthermore, that still doesn&#39;t even make missed miscarriage &quot;common&quot; among pregnant women; it&#39;s certainly nowhere near 1 in 4 pregnancies -- the top results of a quick google search yields stats of ~1%. And regardless, the friend who brought up the issue didn&#39;t even have a missed miscarriage; she had a spontaneous, complete miscarriage -- and yet she still was very upset by being told &quot;miscarriage is common.&quot; So, that&#39;s great that the &quot;miscarriage is common&quot; expression doesn&#39;t bother you, but my original point remains: it does upset some people -- no matter what type of miscarriage they had. </p>

We did start trying again right after the CP, but I didn't get pregnant. I was feeling pretty terrible so my sex drive or even my willingness to try wasn't where it needed to be. 

Yep. Miscarried naturally. I started spotting pinkish brown on a Friday night, OB said not to worry, and it went away. Started spotting again on Sunday afternoon, OB suggested we come in for an ultrasound to check everything out on Monday morning. Monday morning, we see the heartbeat and are assured that everything is totally fine. The heavy bleeding started on Tuesday afternoon. Seeing the heartbeat the day before was such a horrific mindfuck, we thought we were safe. 




TW: Current pregnancy
We did get a BFP the month AFTER that cycle though, and I'll be starting my third trimester on Sunday. My progesterone was low (14), and the OB wanted it above 20 so I was put on oral progesterone pills. The OB basically said, ""I don't know for certain if this will help, but it won't hurt. So l think you should try it."" Maybe the progesterone was the key all along. Maybe it would have been fine without it. I have no idea. The only thing I really did different the third time around is that after the positive OPK, I then spent the next week drinking and eating my way through Prague and Munich, when before I had cut out any questionable substances (sushi, alcohol, soft cheese, Xanax) as soon as I had a positive OPK.

She&#39;s started trying again. 💔 she told me she had been holding off bc she didn&#39;t want to be pregnant before me again. So now I feel guilty plus I&#39;m scared she&#39;ll be pregnant. 
Sorry I&#39;ll stop whining. I know it could be worse but I&#39;m almost 37 and have no one to talk to about it bc then I have convos like the above. </p>
