Can you come up with a new hobby or class to try- painting with a twist, ceramics, pottery, dancing, yoga? I am a pole dancer and let me tell you, pole is a really really great community if you have any studios nearby, definitely try that!

We lost my son neonatally after a 24 week premature birth.

I did not really function the first month. I could barely find the energy to eat. But my husband and I tried to make it a goal to leave the house once a day after about the first 2 weeks - thankfully we have a dog who needed walks, so that was usually our getting out.

I took 3 months before going back to work, although I am in Canada and so I was being paid for those 3 months - I know that not everyone gets that luxury.   For the first month of two work was exhausting, I couldn't concentrate, I couldn't pretend to be a normal person - because I'm not the same kind of normal that I was before my loss. I'm sure you've heard it before, but there is a ""new normal"" now.  It takes time, and my best suggestion is to be kind to yourself and let yourself feel all of the feelings, as much as it sucks to cry in a grocery store (I've been there more than once) it helps to release the emotions, instead of bottling them up.

  
As for trying again, it took us 4 months to be medically cleared, and 9 in total for my husband and I to be on the same page at the same time.

I had my first OB/Ultrasound appt last Monday and was supposed to be 8 weeks 4 days but there was no heartbeat on ultrasound.  It was measuring 7weeks 6 days so it appeared to just happen days prior.  They offered me 4 options-  
1) to let it happen naturally. They said it could take a few weeks but eventually by body would know and expel it. I wasn't having any symptoms of miscarriage like bleeding or cramping.
2) They could give me a pill to help it happen naturally but quicker.  I would of probably taken this option and taken the pills over the weekend, but we actually had plans to go out of town that weekend with some friends and I didn't want to cancel.  And I'm glad I didn't. Going out of town made me feel normal and I think helped me in my healing. 
3) D&C which is a procedure where they go in and remove it. Usually done under general anesthesia. 
4) MVA or a Manual Vacuum Aspiration- this is what I did.  This is like a D&C but it was done in the office under just local lidocaine injection to the cervix, which actually didn't burn as bad as I thought. Overall it took like 15 mins and I felt some pressure and mild cramping but the pain wasn't bad. They had me take 600mg Ibuprofen the night before and morning off.  Afterwards I had some mild cramping and bleeding, Then about 4 days after the procedure more moderate cramping and been having clumps of blood clots come out.

",[],,t1_efz7ska,False,0,[],False,"<div class=""md""><p>I had a similar experience. I had my first OB/Ultrasound appt last Monday and was supposed to be 8 weeks 4 days but there was no heartbeat on ultrasound.  It was measuring 7weeks 6 days so it appeared to just happen days prior.  They offered me 4 options-<br/>
1) to let it happen naturally. They said it could take a few weeks but eventually by body would know and expel it. I wasn&#39;t having any symptoms of miscarriage like bleeding or cramping.
2) They could give me a pill to help it happen naturally but quicker.  I would of probably taken this option and taken the pills over the weekend, but we actually had plans to go out of town that weekend with some friends and I didn&#39;t want to cancel.  And I&#39;m glad I didn&#39;t. Going out of town made me feel normal and I think helped me in my healing. 
3) D&amp;C which is a procedure where they go in and remove it. Usually done under general anesthesia. 
4) MVA or a Manual Vacuum Aspiration- this is what I did.  This is like a D&amp;C but it was done in the office under just local lidocaine injection to the cervix, which actually didn&#39;t burn as bad as I thought. Overall it took like 15 mins and I felt some pressure and mild cramping but the pain wasn&#39;t bad. They had me take 600mg Ibuprofen the night before and morning off.  Afterwards I had some mild cramping and bleeding, Then about 4 days after the procedure more moderate cramping and been having clumps of blood clots come out.  I liked this option, has it was quick, not painful and allowed me to go out of town. </p>

I&#39;m considering taking a little break this cycle from charting in hopes I can curb my obsession a bit. I really want to have the data but I don&#39;t want to worry / stress / obsess over it. And I know I will obsess even more now bc both my pregnancy charts have been triphasic and both my non-pregnancy charts have not. So I feel like I will &quot;know&quot; and either be really sad or really excited.</p>

<p>Luckily I have an Ava so my plan is to keep wearing my Ava, sync it every 4 or 5 days. And not input anything into FF until the end of my cycle. Idk if I&#39;ll be able to stick to this plan or not.</p>

<p>I talked to DH about like not TTA, but not actively TTC by timing BD. Just this month. While I try to heal. I hate to lose a month but if we&#39;re not TTA, I guess I don&#39;t really consider it lost.</p>

<p>Idk. We&#39;ll see how it goes.... </p>

I TMFR last June for trisomy 21.
I had a week between our decision and the procedure.
Take your time to mourn your baby, and name him/her. Plan how do you want to burry or cremate. 
The procedure it self is not that bad, you will feel sore and bleed a bit. The emotional part is huge. You will have flood of hormones for the following 2 weeks. I absolutely did not want the milk to come, so I made sure to start putting ice packs on my breasts as soon as they start getting engorged and wore compression bras. I also avoided hitting my breast while taking hot showers.
I encourage you to seek therapy. Once you are done with your procedure, the anxiety will subside and the avalanche of grief will come at you. Seek support from people around you and shut down any person who belittle your loss or your decision. I only told few around me so I don’t get judgments.
I wish you speedy recovery and strength through the next challenging journey💔

Two weeks ago, I got my first AF after my miscarriage and D&C in November. And it was awful, definitely one of the worst periods of my life. I took a HPT a few days before my cycle started, and it was negative. 

On Tuesday morning (1/29), one day after my period ended, I woke up really sick and passed out while trying to get ready for work. 
Yesterday (2/5) I had some light pink spotting when I peed. 

Today, I took a HPT just for giggles. AND IT WAS POSITIVE. 

Going to call the OB tomorrow, but I’m just curious if other mamas have had this experience, and what happened?

Physically, there shouldn't be too much going on. You might cramp and be sore. I, personally, ended up going into labor and those contractions were painful and ended up causing some sort of intestinal irritation. So I had sharp anal pain for about a month. My bleeding only lasted maybe a bit over a week. Though, I had bleeding on and off throughout my cycles for two months. This didn't happen to me, but it is possible that your milk might come in.

Emotionally, I was a real mess. Your hormones crash around 10 days out. This happened to me with my first (also a vaginal delivery in 2017) but I had a baby to distract me. Without the baby there it was really painful. Grief is hard as is, but with the added burden of your hormones going nuts, you'll want some serious support. Be sure your partner / friends / family know that you'll need the extra help. 

It's going to be a long, long road. It's okay to spend time hurting. I think having a ~2 year old during this process is super difficult because they really don't know what's going on. They can't give you an easy day or process your sadness in any way. If you have family who can help with your LC, reach out.

The wondfos I have are faulty. I dipped one wondfo each in FMU, another one in the same sample watered down 50% (some tiny stupid part of me considered the hook effect), and another one dipped into straight-up h2o.

All three wondfos showed THE EXACT SAME faint lines that I’ve been getting for the past two weeks. Fuck. 

TW, mention of possible bfp (mods please delete if not allowed, I’ll keep this as brief as possible):

I also dipped a FRER into the full-strength FMU, which showed lines that may be progressing. Was reminded that we did BD around the 4 or 5 week mark. I’m going to go in for betas this weekend and see what’s up, because literally none of that makes any sense to me.

I'm also really scared about what we might find with the genetic testing/fertility specialist. I've always had this...feeling I wouldn't be able to naturally have a child. Everyone made fun of me and reassured me I was being crazy, but what if I was right all along?

There&#39;s another good friend I&#39;ve told and she hasn&#39;t checked on me once. It&#39;s day 4... That hurts. It&#39;s weird to figure out who to tell. I had some run in with a few people last time around that were very unpleasant. I don&#39;t even speak to my MIL anymore (there were previous issues). Maybe therapist can help with this too. Haha</p>

<p>I also deactivated my other social medias to try and cut back on stress. </p>

My husband and I just went to get my blood results from the doctor - HCG has come up to 850. My original result was 420 (which already suggested I was a week early with my dates) so the doctor was reluctant to call it a MC yet. I insisted the bleeding was not slowing and I was worried, so she sent me for an ultrasound which showed a small sac sitting low in my uterus. The radiologist said it was 'probably a sac in the process of MC, or a large blood clot in the uterus'. She apologised for my loss and gave me some tissues while I cried my eyes out.

My husband is being very realistic and has agreed it is gone. I did a quick google and learned that a low sac is not always a MC, although it is not a good sign. Between the bleeding, the loss of pregnancy symptoms, the low HCG and the low sac, you'd think I have enough bad signs that I'd just call it what it is, but I keep clinging to my google searches in some vain hope of keeping this baby... Until I get a drop in HCG or a completely clear ultrasound I don't know if I can accept that it is gone :(

I'm trying to keep a sane head about things though, and trying to form a contingency plan in the (very) likely case that I need it. I will definitely follow your lead and find a psychologist to help me through this. My workplace offers an employee assistance program which includes free psych sessions, so I'll probably start there. 

I'm also considering a career change. I did read that study you posted and I'm definitely worried that my current job may be a contributing factor. I'm in a high stress environment - both my bosses were actually just sacked a couple of weeks ago due to underperformance of our department. My husband is all for me finding a new job, as I'm constantly stressed and have fallen out of love with it. Unfortunately I am remunerated very well for this high level of stress and we have become accustomed to a very nice lifestyle. The job is also FIFO - I'll have to do some heavy budgeting to figure out what sort of changes we will have to make if I move to a job in the city.

My doctor has agreed that if this is a second MC that she will refer me to a specialist, so the last part of the contingency plan is to find some fertility specialists in our area tonight.

You said you told less people this time round. I did completely the opposite. The first time round, my husband and I didn't tell a soul about the pregnancy. When the MC happened I think that was the loneliest I have ever felt in my life. Of course my husband was very supportive but I think only a woman or a mother can know the depth of the grief we feel.

This time round, as soon as I got my positive test I told my parents and my two best friends, one of whom is a new mother. My husband told his mother, sister, and eldest daughter. Now that I'm probably having a MC, it's been so comforting to know that the people around me are aware of my situation. My mother and bestie have been checking in on me and, for what it's worth, I have the sympathy and prayers of my in-laws. 

Anyway, I encourage you to reach out to your close friends. If they care about you, you will not be a burden and they will be there for you to lean on. Either way, I'll be floating around this group and you are welcome to lean on me <3

P.S. Don't feel bad about getting drunk. If I'd had conclusive evidence of a MC this afternoon (and if I wasn't in complete denial), I'd be drinking myself stupid right now too. Sometimes you just need a bit of relief xx

It doesn't help that almost no one I know have had (or been open about having) a miscarriage. I am paranoid too because my health has not always been the best, I have a bunch of different allergies, and I also suffer from anxiety and have a family history of depression. 

What has helped me is researching how best to TTC and reading posts about women having their rainbow babies. I hope that when we do start TTC, the stars will align and all of the research I'm doing will pay off. Try not to think so poorly of yourself and your situation. Just try to plan as best you can. My friend just had a baby 2 months ago and I've been spending a lot of time at her house.

But I can&#39;t help being nervous about whether or not I will miscarry again or if I will have difficulty getting pregnant. It doesn&#39;t help that almost no one I know have had (or been open about having) a miscarriage. I am paranoid too because my health has not always been the best, I have a bunch of different allergies, and I also suffer from anxiety and have a family history of depression. </p>

<p>What has helped me is researching how best to TTC and reading posts about women having their rainbow babies. I hope that when we do start TTC, the stars will align and all of the research I&#39;m doing will pay off. Try not to think so poorly of yourself and your situation. Just try to plan as best you can. My friend just had a baby 2 months ago and I&#39;ve been spending a lot of time at her house. I creeped out another friend of mine who got pregnant shortly after I miscarried because my husband and I were overly excited for her and her baby. She thought we were being weird and has minimized contact. </p>

<p>On one hand I hate to not have the data... But on the other hand, I am now concerned about my stress levels. I&#39;m wondering if charting my cycles makes things more stressful.

The day ended well when I went to pick up my puppy. He's been a godsend during this time. 

I think I remember saying how maybe we will be in the same bump group soon. And right now we should be. 💔 I'm so sorry you're here with me. I can't believe how close our timelines are. I was 5+1 when the bleeding started. I got my BFP on my 5 year anniversary which would have been one of the best memories to have each year. Now it will be bittersweet. I also really started looking forward to an October baby! 

I'm going to start seeing a therapist who specializes in infertility including loss. My first appt is Friday. I'm also going to see an OB who is on my insurance and push for testing. I did have some elective testing done, pretty basic, but everything looked great. So why is this happening? Idk if you saw it but I linked to a study on risk factors for 1st trimester miscarriage. I am worried about my stress level. 

We told less people this time around and now I can't figure out if that was good or bad. None of my family is reaching out to me because they don't know. I will probably tell them this week. Not sure which is worse.... Having to tell them right away or having to struggle with to tell them at all and feel even more lonely during this time.

So sorry for you, thank you for reaching out. I wish you weren't here with me but it does feel good to be connected. If only we could meet for coffee or lunch! Or wine. I hate to admit it but I got drunk on Saturday. :( I did take a HPT before which was negative and the bleeding started ramping up so I knew. Then I got my bloodwork back that I had done the day before and my HCG was at 11, too low for 5 weeks. I'm now on day 3 of bleeding. Idk if you read my other comments but Saturday morning I dreamt that I started bleeding. I got up, went out to take care of my animals, I ate breakfast, I was about to start some prenatal yoga when I decided to go pee first. The beginning of the end. 

This is fucking horrible. I was so angry I wanted to punch holes in my walls (I didn't). I don't recall feeling this angry last time. Honestly I feel like it's 10x worse this time around. 

Hugs and love to you, my friend in loss. ♥️

I&#39;m really glad you&#39;ve done the same- it really does make a difference. Let us know how it goes. </p>

<p>I know that feeling of being broken very well. I&#39;ve always been the one that laughs things off, bounces back. Not this time. I&#39;m just aching to feel nothing most days. I&#39;m so tired of this game, and I&#39;m not playing it very well. Thanks for sharing your story as well. It really does help to know you&#39;re not alone. </p>

- would you tell a cancer patient that they were playing god for using medically available treatment options to treat their disease? I’m guessing you would say no. Why is this different? 
- you can ask a clinic to blind the gender on a PGS report, and not be told at any point in the process, if that is important to you. They will generally advise transferring the best embryo first anyway. If you have embryos of equivalent quality and have a gender preference, they will honor that. But many people choose to blind this information. 
- IVF isn’t a guarantee (I wish it was). My husband and I needed IVF first for male factor issues and then for screening for a complex genetic disorder that he carries. Said otherwise, there should have been no issues on my end. It still took 2 clinics and 3 protocols to find what worked for my body.

November 2018 was Cycle 72. Cycle 72 was IVF #1. I have been pregnant for enough total weeks to have a near-term baby, but I've never made it to 17 weeks in any single pregnancy. February 2019 is Cycle 73 because we lost the baby we had in Cycle 72.

My SIL has a 4 year old... and a 2 year old. A (former) friend has a 5 year old, a 3 year old, and a 1 year old. Another (former) friend has a 3 year old and a 1 year old. Another (former) friend has two year old twins and a new born. And a current friend has a 7 year old, a 5 year old, a 3 year old, and a 1 year old. 

How did so many friendships wither away, but the most fertile of them all is still around? It's like the sun. You know how when you are sun burned, even the warmth of the sun through a thick tee shirt hurts? You know how the sun can rise over the mountain tops and cast a shadow that seems even darker than a moon-lit night? That's what's it's like. Some people have suns that shine too brightly. I see my SIL maybe once a month, and even then, sometimes it's too much for me. Sometimes, I wish I could see her more often. All those former friends-- they hurt me or cast shadows that sent me to dark places in my mind. I didn't want to lose those friendships, but I had to, for my own well-being. 

And the friend who is still around? She had 4 losses-- several of which were medically necessary terminations. Her sun was never too bright for me, even when we conceived in the same pregnancy and she got a take home baby while I got a referral for IVF. Even when she was struggling with no sleep and a newborn and feeling like a milk cow, I could be there and not feel too much pain or go to a dark place in my head. 

You may need to avoid excessive sun exposure for a while. My friend is like a beautiful sunrise in an arctic spring, warm and lovely and so very welcome. While the friends who fell away were like the afternoon sun along the equator-- baking every sign of life into sun-bleached skeletal remains in an endless desert.

<p>I hope you get your answers soon and your new plan works out. I&#39;m hoping I can move on to RPL testing, hopefully my insurance will cover it... I know 2 losses is still fairly common, but of course I don&#39;t want to go thru this again. </p>

<p>So far my GYN, midwife and naturopath DRs are all out of network so I think I&#39;m going to find an OB in network and go from there.. I&#39;m afraid this is going to get too expensive. </p>

We didn't get much useful info. And unfortunately ~75%+ of people with repeat loss do not find an answer. =(  

We did find a few small things that we adjusted...but my RE didn't think they were the cause. And I still had loss afterwards so I'd doubt it, too.

* My Prolactin was on the high end of normal, but not outside the range. We did attempt to lower it with meds and it came down a bit. But one of the biggest things high Prolactin does is actually keep you from conceiving, and I didn't have that issue.
* My CD21 progesterone tests were consistently low, but this is likely explained by poor egg quality not much else. I did start on Progesterone supplements post-ovulation and had slightly better numbers. But still had losses after. And did NOT do this for the 1 successful pregnancy I had.
* My karyotyping had an abnormal result but nobody could decide if it was impacting my fertility. It is not a known fertility issue like translocations/etc. The doctors suggested testing my parents and we found that my mom has it/passed it to me, so it was deemed an unlikely cause since she has it and was 3/3 with pregnancies.

We also genetically tested our 2nd baby and found no reason for his passing.

So I literally was put on a ""try again and we'll see how it goes"" plan.

It is mostly believed that low progesterone during pregnancy is a symptom of the loss not a cause. So, going on progesterone after you have already conceived is still ""controversial"" in that we aren't sure it helps. In fact studies are pretty sure it doesn't do much. But they (doctors) seem to think it doesn't hurt, either. Progesterone supplements (most often) can't hurt. But outside of IVF, there is no concrete evidence that progesterone replacement is helpful. 

Also, most specialists believe that if supplementation might help, it needs to be started at 3DPO to possibly have an impact ...even though many try to go on it after conception.

Have you had your progesterone tested while not pregnant? I would suggest the CD21 test on numerous cycles. 

If your results are consistently low, I would ask for progesterone supplementation post ovulation. You would track ovulation and take the supplements starting 3DPO. Then test around 14dpo and stop the supplements if negative.

========
As for Metformin, its my understanding that it is often used to help people with PCOS conceive but isn't necessarily needed during the pregnancy. It all depends on your insulin levels, which vary widely across women with PCOS. If yours are high, Metformin during pregnancy can lower the odds of miscarriage...but only to that of a person without PCOS which is still 1:4. 

=========

You cannot always prevent a miscarriage. Don't I wish!! 

Neither of these could be your issue and you may not need either medication.  *BUT, I would seek another opinion and find a doctor more willing to at least discuss these things with you in detail instead of dismissing you and your concerns.*

You can check that out <a href=""https://www.reddit.com/r/ttcafterloss/comments/a4gdcp/seeking_de_experiences_to_calm_my_anxiety/"">here</a>.</p>

<p>I was super scared of the anesthesia piece in particular. I was lucky to have a fantastic care team all the way around, who was very sympathetic and also listened to my wishes. All in all the physical part of it was the &quot;easy&quot; part. The emotional recovery was/has been much more difficult. Feel free to PM me if you&#39;d like to chat more about it. </p>

I was pretty sure she was pregnant before she announced because she was doing all the things I was to hide it (we travel together for work so there is a lot of hiding that needs to happen.) She announced it during lunch while I was actively waiting to pass my MMC and three days before my D&amp;C was scheduled. Same time frame I would have announced since she waited a few extra weeks.  I haven&#39;t been able to even look at her since. Each time I am thrown right back to that feeling I had in that moment.  It was awful. Others, it comes and goes- usually it is OK but today is not great since this morning I woke up from a dream where I had a perfect baby girl and I am mad I have to exist in this reality instead.

I just want the time to pass quicker and I hope that helps me. Did you do anything like that to help you get through the last three months? Do you still have pain from the c section? </p>

“Women who are emotionally and physically ready to try to get pregnant after a miscarriage may not have to delay getting pregnant to reduce the risk of miscarriage, said Velez Edwards.

“If (women) want to try to get pregnant, there's no need to wait unless they personally want to,” said Dr. Thomas Price, an infertility specialist with Duke Health in Durham, North Carolina, who wasn’t involved in the study.”

So yeah, not really following my doctors advice as I don’t think her hesitation suits my specific situation. We didn’t technically wait until my first as we had unprotected sex after 4 weeks (thankfully I healed pretty quickly), we just weren’t actively trying until after it! </p>

One thing that helped me was getting an HSG, which confirmed my left tube was still open and functional. It’s not a guarantee, but it eased my mind about the risk of a second. I scheduled it soon after my surgery because I’d already hit my out of pocket maximum and I was able to fight for them to code it under “history of pregnancy complications” and my insurance covered it. 

That said, it still took me 8 months to be ready to try again, and only under the care of a fertility specialist who would be willing to do early screens and monitoring.

We just had loss #4 from a perfect IVF embryo, loss #4 in the last 6 years. I haven't done dishes in 2 weeks. I went 4 days without showering. I have eaten ice cream, chips, and candy at every meal. I cancelled long-standing plans because I didn't feel like being around happy people, and I made my husband stay home because I didn't want to be left home alone, either. I aoplogized for being useless and I said I'm having trouble caring about the consequences of my actions. My husband's response was, ""Just focus on getting through today. You're doing great. I don't expect you to do anything you don't feel up to."" 

He hasn't always been so understanding. This is his fourth time around this particular shitty block. He's watched me fall apart and put myself back together over and over. He trusts the process and knows that I will heal and recover. 

You will also heal and recover. A therapist is trained to help you manoever your way through feelings like this. Right now, I'm a bit self-destructive and a little reckless. Not in a drink myself into a near coma and then go for a joy ride kind of way, but definitely in a eat too much and buy shit I don't need kind of way.

It helps to be able to identify my feelings, to name them, to accept them, and to appreciate them for what they are. I also feel anger and resentment and regret and hopelessness and to a degree, a devastation that hurts too much to name or accept. I can accept a lot of my feelings, navigate around them, set goals to work toward despite the obstacles in the way. 

I'm 38. Going to be 39 this year. I was freshly turned 32 when we started trying to get pregnant. People who met their spouses after we started trying have kids in kindergarten already. I know that feeling of being the only person on the freaking planet that can't get or stay pregnant. A good therapist can help you develop coping strategies for that feeling. 

For me, it's very triggering when people ask me about kids. My way of coping with it is to tell people honestly that we have experienced a number of tragic losses. Then I usually mention that we have some fur babies and ask of they'd like to see pictures. I don't give out details, but being honest helps me cope with such insensitive questions. I have a canned response that sets firm boundaries on the topic of children. It brings people up short, but the important part is that it allows me to move the conversation on quickly without losing my mind. 

That's not to say nothing sets me off ever... As I was getting prepped for my D&C, they played a lullaby on the overhead speakers for the whole hospital to announce the birth of a baby.

I would suggest, that if you're TTC again, you not throw out all the baby stuff you recently got since you'll hopefully be needing it again soon.  Do you have somewhere you can store it in the meantime so it's out of sight?  


What your husband said sucks and is uncalled for.  I'm sorry. Perhaps couples counselling is an option for you?  At the very least it could be a good source of support through your grief and anxiety.  


I'm not sure where you live but 31 is not old at all.  In my neighbourhood (in Stockholm) the average age for a first time mom is 38.  Women are just focused on their careers and there are loads of children to be seen.  MMC's can happen to anyone, regardless of their age.

I got pregnant the first month of trying with both of my kids and had healthy pregnancies and quick labors.

After the blood draws I found out the pregnancy wasn't viable because my numbers weren't going up, so I waited to miscarry again. 19 days after I got the positive pregnancy test I started to bleed. I bleed for 11 days then the bleeding stopped for 4 days and started back up. I am now on day 6 of bleeding with no end in sight.

I am still going in for blood draws because I have not gotten back to zero yet. I go in tomorrow for hopefully my last one.

Why is this so hard this time? What changed? My doctor said it is just bad luck and to keep trying. I'm about to call it quits but I really want one more child. I am 26 years old.

I am most upset about the age gaps. My two kids have a little less than two year age gap. Even if I got pregnant tomorrow the age gap between my youngest and the third baby would be close to three years. I really dont want my last to feel left out.

I really would've liked to see a nice dark line, although I know it doesn't mean much. I think I'll test again this week (I only had 2 tests). 

I'm actually not nearly as worried / freaked out as I thought I'd be. I'm focusing on a lot of yoga and meditation. Whenever I have negative thoughts, I try to interrupt myself with ""What if everything is perfect this time? What if everything works out?"" Or I try to imagine hearing the heartbeat, my belly growing, my birth, holding my baby, etc. I play it out and try to be happy. I feel happy but I'm just not letting myself get super excited like last time, which sucks. I updated my apps to pregnancy mode... But I'm feeling hesitant to join any groups as it was just so hard to leave them last time. 

I have an appt with my Dr today to go over some elective bloodwork I had done, so I'm hoping I'll get some reassurance from her. 

Honestly I am kind of shocked it happened so fast again. I guess I have no problem getting pregnant, which I am super thankful for, I just hope my baby can stay with me this time! 

What are people's thoughts on checking bloodwork in early pregnancy after loss? Is this more informational or is there something that can be done if something looks low/off? 

Sending to peace to all my fellow limbo ladies. I hope we all end up in October bb together!

First I am so sorry for your losses. So sorry. Hang in there.  

Next is that i also have Hoshimoto's, with normal (1.4) TSH and antibodies similar to yours. While I don't yet have a living baby, I was able to carry a baby successfully. She unfortunately passed two weeks ago from an extremely rare anomaly (2 in 1 million) that has absolutely nothing to do with me having Hashimoto's. So while I know you are suffering these two losses back to back, keep in mind that these losses may have nothing to do with your thyroid.  

From all of the research I have done, having your TSH below 2 is what is generally recommended for pregnancy. Sounds like yours is in the wheelhouse.  If it helps, I found the book ""Your Healthy Pregnancy with Thyroid Disease"" by D Trentini to be very helpful. It is rather redundant, but you can skip to the parts relevant to you. She sets it up this way on purpose. Probably less helpful (because it is what works for me and your story may be different!), is that I respond better to Synthroid over Levothyroxine. I also do eat gluten free and notice a huge difference in my thyroid stability. When I was not gluten free, my thyroid levels were all over the place. Since being gluten free, I have been on the same dose for a long while now. And yes, keeping stress down is good for all of us, so it cannot hurt to practice yoga, meditation, acupuncture, etc :).

Processing such a huge tragedy and trauma is going to be hard.  I just hope for as much strength for you as you can gather around you in support.  Being here and feeling not so alone helped me so much.  There is nothing quite as terrible as stillbirth and carrying your baby inside you after they've passed.  Not many people understand. No one in my life understood but my husband and I.  So this community was essential for me. I have lived in that hell before.
  
For the practical - my milk coming in was more than just a painful slap in the face reminder that I didn't have my son, it hurt like hell too.  It only gets worse the more engorged they get.  Here is my advice: don't express them. If you start expressing milk to get some relief, it will keep coming in.  Which means you live with the pain longer.  If you want your milk to dry up as quickly as possible, try not to touch them at all. Take pain meds, and wear the tightest sports bras you can handle, at all times.  Switch between ice packs and cabbage leaves placed directly on your breasts.  (I know this sounds weird, but it really, really helped.  I can't eat or smell cabbage anymore, it turns my stomach, but it was relief).  Get the green cabbage, because the purple will stain your skin. There are teas you can drink too, but I didn't try them though some people have success. Avoid warm water in your breasts -  I would keep a washcloth soaked in ice water in a bucket while I showered and place it over my breasts so that I could keep them iced, but still manage a warm shower for the rest of me.  My milk was gone in 5 days or so.  It was agonizing.
  
I don't know if this will be helpful or if you are even looking to connect, but my son had a complicated medical condition called hydraencephaly, and when he was delivered at 37+ weeks, his head was in the 40+ week range.  His brain tissue had been completely destroyed and replaced by fluids. I'm not sure what you know of your son's medical specifics, or even if you can get through them if you are wading through shock like we were, but I'm a PM away if you ever get to the point where you want to talk about it.

On some levels, it doesn't really matter if it is hormones, you feel what you feel and let that be ok. You just lost your baby and I am certain that is one of the worst things a mama can feel.  Please give yourself time. Take care of yourself. Find something simple that comforts you and talk to people who validate you and help you to feel good and loved.

I just miscarried at 8 weeks last weekend, and we had a chemical pregnancy the cycle before that.

I have a feeling I'll be in for a world of disappointment if it takes longer this time, so I'm trying to put a plan into place for things I can do to distract myself from the TTC process.

1. Projects to fix up our house. The bonus to getting these going and finished up is that it would be difficult for me to work on many of them once I do become pregnant, and it will be nice to have them done before a baby arrives.
2. A new hobby. I need one that occupies my hands, because I'm doing a lot of stress eating. I'm thinking maybe something like embroidery or cross-stitch. I don't feel up to learning how to knit right now, but it's another option.
3. Setting up nights out with friends. I'd like to plan a karaoke night, go to trivia competitions,  have some game nights at our house, and do an escape room. Maybe even get people together for a girls' weekend away or something.
4. Start exercising. Honestly, this is my least favorite thing on this list, but I know I'll feel better if I do it. Plus, at least I won't be stress eating while I'm at the gym.
5. Take some little weekend trips to nearby locations I've been wanting to visit.
6. Job hunt. Okay, I take it back, this is my least favorite activity on this list. But it must be done.

That's all I've come up with so far.  I'm hoping that doing all this stuff will not only distract me, but maybe bring me a little joy in the process. If I don't have something else to focus on, I know I'm going to drive myself crazy thinking about TTC.

I understand it&#39;s hard and a little sad when you&#39;ve been trying for a while and still get nothing but keep trying and don&#39;t give up.</p>

I’m 6w6d but measuring 6w1d and while there’s a growing gestational sac (0.5mm/day) and what looks like a small fetal pole and the shadow of a yolk sac it’s all odd and I’m suspected to have a blighted ovum. No heartbeat. No clear yolk sac. Delays despite IVF. My betas doubled early on but slowed down since. Current beta is 11k or so. It’s not doubling within 72 hrs now. I’d like to just move on but part of me is fixated on the hope and the what if. If anyone has a second to share similar stories or look at my scan I’d appreciate that. It seems like the progesterone shots and estrogen preserve what otherwise was non viable. </p>

Progesterone cream 2x a day

B vitamin complex B6 100, B12 1000

Magnesium (I recommend Natural Calm)

Cod liver oil-Butter  oil combination also helps with inflammation--I order mine from Green  Pastures.

That first month ttc I was fairly lax and didn&#39;t POAS until a few days before AF. The second month I was an anxious mess. Tracking via opks, logging every symptom, and testing from 9 DPO. If I even had a sniffle I was consulting Dr. Google hoping it would be a good sign.  The third month (Sep 2018) went like the second with amped up anxiety. This anxiety (along with some not so stellar semen analysis results) was why my husband put a pause on us ttc until fall 2019. We did have an unplanned pregnancy in December but just had our second loss last week. Oddly enough, this second loss makes me feel like when we ttc again I&#39;ll be avoiding logging symptoms or testing so obsessively. Not sure if it&#39;s just me trying to protect my feelings or what. </p>

As all in on trying again immediately I am also feeling that panic about what if it happens again/ can I handle it  BUT I also think what if I wait too long ( on the older side). I envy people who are so SURE of their choices but I feel like a lot of us are super good arguing both sides. No real insight here just- I feel you girl.</p>

I don’t *think* this can be leftover because I have confirmed ovulation on ultrasound (IVF w/ PGD consult) at CD 14. My obgyn’s office said I can come in for bloodwork next week to see for sure. Feeling really relieved and hopeful right now. But still cautious because it’s so early (3+2 if it’s new) and I guess I don’t know for sure if it’s old or new. If it’s new, I am really hoping we get to 10 weeks this time so we can actually do the CVS for my genetic disorder. 

Edit: 1/26 PM update - things are getting darker! Used a cheapie this morning with FMU and it was pretty faint like yesterday’s but I drink a ton before bed to take my prenatals so I went back to sleep and tested again like 4 hours later with much more concentrated pee. These tests aren’t even supposed to be that sensitive but it’s VERY positive!!!

Everyone experiences grief in different ways.

&#x200B;

We have been at this for 6 years, and I've run into several people who felt like my chemical pregnancies aren't anything to be sad over. I've run into people who felt like my miscarriages were something to be thankful for because at least I didn't have a stillbirth at 30+ weeks. I've experienced varying levels of grief, too.

&#x200B;

My first miscarriage was in the second trimester with my ex-husband. I still remember the baby's birthday every year. The baby would have been 18 this year! But I am so thankful that I didn't bring a child into this world with that man as a father. He tried to kill me a few years later after he got back from Iraq. I can't imagine how much that would have hurt our child, especially if he did actually make good on that attempt. So yeah-- it sucks that I don't have an 18 year old, but I am also really grateful that the universe took that pregnancy from me.

&#x200B;

I've had 3 miscarriage with my current husband. We got pregnant on our wedding night and lost the baby 3 months later. That one was tough, but I was okay. Our second miscarriage happened at 6 weeks, with that miscarriage, I went to a place of terrible despair. My puppy couldn't make me smile. There was no light in my life. I lived off sleeping pills, sleeping as much as I could because I just didn't want to be awake. I was in a deep depression that just kept spiraling as we got to the baby's due date. And it took another year after the due date before I really felt like there was anything happy in my life again. With this one, I'm upset-- I'm having panic attacks which never happened with the other ones, but I'm not in that ""no light can pierce this fog of grief"" kind of sad. I definitely struggled with feeling like I wanted my baby that was dead for two weeks out of me and wishing that they wouldn't take the baby from me. I am without a doubt, handling this IVF loss at 11 weeks better than I handled my last miscarriage at 6 weeks. 

&#x200B;

No one has any right to tell you how you'll experience grief. You can be sad and feel a sense of loss at whatever intensity it hits you. There are people out there who experienced a chemical pregnancy and it hits them with the same intensity that your stillbirth hit you with. There are people out there who experienced still births and were able to process the grief in a few days. 

&#x200B;

Accept how you feel. Accept that the stillbirth hurts longer and deeper than the miscarriage. Accept that the traumatic experience of a stillbirth weighs heavier on you than a miscarriage. It's okay, and it's not disrespectful to you or to your husband or to your other losses. It just is what it is. 

&#x200B;

I've had two missed miscarriages. The first one was many years ago. I was uninsured so I couldn't afford a D&C.

Specifically, nine weeks of psychological turmoil and varying levels of bleeding that left me anemic and weak before I finally passed all the tissue. Which was messed up because that pregnancy never developed beyond five weeks so having to carry the baby longer dead than I did alive really did a number on me. 

I'm going through the second one now after moving to a different area. They gave me the pills readily. The first round didn't work. I only had a couple of hours of mild cramps and no bleeding. I had to call to ask for a second round, which is working. It's been much easier on me both physically and mentally.

I can only talk about my d&c so others may have different opinions but honestly, it was way easier than i thought. I can tell you how it went for me. 6 weeks into the pregnancy i had massive bleeding, huge, palm sized clots and it was fucking traumatic. Went into the doctors a few days later, hcg was still rising.  that hcg got to 57000 by week 8 but 2 ultrasounds over the next few weeks only saw a gestational sac so we opted to d&c. The hospital was warm and caring and my kick ass, no nonsense obgyn did the procedure. I had to get an iv and answer a bunch of questions, mostly to do with anesthesia. No eating or drinking after midnight. I was out for the whole thing and they let my husband stay with me right up until i went into the room for the procedure. When i woke up, i had a snack and they had put the super sexy maxipad panties on me. Hottt. I had some painkillers given to me while i was under but ibuprofen was enough that night. 

I had some mild cramping and light bleeding that turned to spotting after a few days.  after 8 days, even the spotting disappeared. No baths, swimming, tampons or sex for 2 weeks after the d&c then i had a checkup exam and was given the green light for it all. Ovulated 3 weeks after the procedure, first period came 2 weeks after that, nearly 5 weeks to the day after the d&c.

I was given the option to wait or take medication but for the former, my hcg just kept rising so i was reluctant to wait it out and for the latter, I'd already had a taste of the trauma that bleeding huge clots in your bathroom could bring so i opted out of that. 

The procedure was quick, only 20 mins or so, though i was out for twice that, and the recovery was smooth. Im sure everyone's experience is different, but for me, i would absolutely do it again.

I originally had issues opening the path report & had to email my doctor about it, which ended up in me getting an email with the results and 2 nurse calls to make sure I figured it out, all of them telling me it was 46XX. The last nurse told me I think 3 separate times it was a “sweet little girl”. K. Cool. Got it Nancy, thanks for rubbing it in. 

Knowing the sex made it way more real, like you said. But you can choose how you refer to things moving forward.

My POC had to be sent for testing as there was concern I had a molar pregnancy. Nope, 46XX. It never had even occurred to me that we’d get that kind of result, I had just assumed it’d be yes molar/ no not molar. I originally had issues opening the path report &amp; had to email my doctor about it, which ended up in me getting an email with the results and 2 nurse calls to make sure I figured it out, all of them telling me it was 46XX. The last nurse told me I think 3 separate times it was a “sweet little girl”. K. Cool. Got it Nancy, thanks for rubbing it in. </p>

Often the issue with ""waiting til after 3"" is due to insurance. But that isn't true of all insurance companies PLUS some of the very basic blood tests needed may not count as fertility tests AND/OR may be cheap enough out of pocket to make it worth it.

My suggestions for beginning tests: 

* CD3 testing
* Near surge testing, to compare to CD3 results
* Thyroid testing...and ALL of them, not just TSH and T3 (so ask for T3, T3RU, T4, and TSH)
* CD21 testing on *multiple* cycles

But for you I'd also suggest to talk to them about testing more due to your autoimmune issues/etc. I'm not sure what all you'd test there so please speak to your doctors.

In conclusion, ask and check if you can test now. Consider doing some of the basic ones even if not covered (usually decently cheap but I don't know your finances. :) )

In the days after my MC, leading up to Xmas, I was very constipated and had a ton of pain in and around my butt, so much so that I couldn't sit down without pain. Generally, a bath with a ton of epsom salts would help. When I mentioned it to one of my nurses, she said that the constipation was probably from being dehydrated and that it would probably go away soon, and recommended a stool softener, which I took for a while. My stools softened and the constipation went away but I was left with sort of a low and slow throbbing pain in my butt, especially when sitting down, and especially when sitting cross-legged (how I sit on the couch normally).

It went away between Christmas and New Years - I got my first period last week, and this past Monday the pain came back in my butt, but it's worse. It feels like a combination of muscle strain from BMs and like I just took a 2 hour spin class on the hardest bike seat in the world. It hurts all the time at that low level but occasionally will be a sharp or almost burning pain. My GP can't see me until next week, and I'm wondering if this is something I should be going to emerg about. Sorry if this is all over the place - I also find that a muscle relaxant/pain killer (I use Robax) helps quite a bit with the pain.

Is this just leftover soft tissue trauma from the MC or something I should be worried about and seeking attention for? As I'm sure many of you can relate to, I'm sick of hospitals and doctors and really sick of talking about the MC.

EDIT: I should also mention that when I had my US to confirm my MC the US tech and the ER doc pointed out two cysts on my left side, I believe in my ovaries (they just said ""On this side"") asked if I knew about them, then expressed surprise that I didn't experience pain from them.

I have a 2 week follow-up appt for my D&C this Thursday. What questions should I ask? What should I demand? I usually go into a deferential listening mode at doctor appointments only to learn later that I should have asked X, Y or Z. 

So far I just want to know what tests they ran on the fetus (and results, if any), what my HCG is/when we can begin the FET process (pending RE consent) and if I can finally have sex again. 

Secondary question, was anyone else’s libido kind of high in the period after a MC but before you can have sex again? Or am I a monster?

I believe our daughter brought us this baby as a gift to us. It&#39;s been a difficult pregnancy so far because I am no where near done grieving. I secretly wish it was still her we were expecting.
The healing process is slow, and I dont think ever will be complete. A part of us is missing forever. For a long time I treated her urn as if it was her- checking on her in the middle of the night, bringing her for errands, talking and reading to her. Took me a long time to let go of that and there are moments I feel guilty or like a bad mom for not doing it... 
It gets harder before it gets easier. 6 months post loss was the darkest moment for me. But it does get easier, some days I dont have to force the smile and some days I can remember her fondly and not in pain stricken way. </p>

<p>The guilt is normal. Its mother guilt. We are supposed to protect our children and we couldn&#39;t save them from this. It&#39;s a normal feeling and I dont think it ever goes away with time. It just gets quieter in our heads after hearing it repeated to ourselves all the time.</p>

I know many women trying already don&#39;t smoke or drink just in case, so if that&#39;s you and waiting makes you feel better, do it</p>

All the following comes from my OB. They don’t exactly know what causes pre-e; they know it stems from a badly functioning placenta but why that happens is unknown. The main theories are:

A) it’s an immune system issue resulting from being “allergic” to your partner (hence the testing for autoimmune diseases like lupus). This is a very simplified explanation, it’s much more complicated but I wanted to be brief. 

B) insufficient blood flow - certain clotting factors can impact the growth of the blood vessels and how “deeply” the placenta roots. Which in turn impacts fetal growth. The tests will hopefully rule out any clotting problems that could arise in subsequent pregnancies; if I do have any positive tests show up that will impact my treatment if/when I conceive again. 

Things like weight, age, and genetics are risk factors but are not causes of pre-e per se. 

These tests seem to be run of the mill for people with a history of pre-e, and I’ve heard of them being done for women who have had recurrent loss. I’m not 100% sure if my thyroid is being tested to see if I’ve suffered damage from the HELLP or if it’s related to TTC.

A Scary Mommy article share about &quot;bigger age gaps&quot; and a thing about how they were very deliberate in their 3.5 year age gap. I hate her so much. I was trying to be very deliberate with our 4 year age gap, but it turns out that even timing sex perfectly with ovulation won&#39;t necessarily get you pregnant. And sometimes it does but something was wrong and you lose the pregnancy and don&#39;t get pregnant again immediately despite your best efforts. UGH. </p>
