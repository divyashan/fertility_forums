<p>So many people on my social media sharing pregnancy announcements and I&#39;m happy for them but there&#39;s this twinge inside that just kills me. </p>

<p>Why can&#39;t it be me? 
Why did I lose my baby? </p>

<p>I hope you&#39;re doing as well as you can be. Sending so much love ‚ô•Ô∏è‚ô•Ô∏è‚ô•Ô∏è</p>

With my first MMC, 4 weeks had passed between fetal demise amd detection and my body showed 0 signs of figuring it out. I was sent for a D&C while awake the following day and it was awful. The bleeding slowed a few days later but then I started soaking a pad an hour 5 days post procedure. They gave me the option of miso but warned it was awful and recommended another ""mini"" D&C to clear the rest out. I cried so much at the thought of doing that awake again but ended up choosing it. Again, awful. The first D&C actually did yield tissue that was able to be tested for chromosomal abnormalities, though it came back normal 46XY. 

Things were fine after that but my period was so light for the next 4 months that I was concerned about scarring. I had a hysteroscopy done and needed to be treated for endometritis. I got pregnant again 2 months later and used progesterone suppositories for the first time. That pregnancy was always just a little off and ultimately ended in MMC at 8 weeks following no growth beyond 6.5 weeks. I was so apprehensive about another D&C but ultimately it was busy season at work (I'm not in finance but it would be like learning of a MMC on april 10 if you were a CPA- not good timing) and I couldn't afford to be out, nor would I want to. I opted for a D&C but this time was at the RE clinic and knocked out. Highly recommend. Testing showed tetraploidy (92XXXX). I was told to expect bleeding for 2 weeks, which came and went. I called at 2.5 weeks for continued bleeding and they told me that could be normal and not to worry. They finally let me come in at 3.5 weeks and found retained tissue via US. I was given the miso option again and took it. She gave me pain meds to go with it, but the miso did nothing. I spent that day (Monday) high as a kite watching TV and waiting for action thst never came. Tuesday was the same. I went to work Wednesday and in the afternoon felt some of the worst stomach pains of my life, ran to the bathroom, and...nothing. I went back to the bathroom an hour later before I was to board a train home and there was a clot in my underwear the size of a lemon. I hadn't felt it come out and was shocked. I debated saving it but it seemed to just be a clot so I flushed it. I was shocked when I went back to the doctor the next day to learn that wasn't all of the retained tissue! She stuck a catheter into my uterus and sucked the last bit out. Since all this dragged on for a month she recommended taking the pill for a month to ""reset"" my body. I also had another hysteroscopy which again showed endometritis (and then was allergic to the drug they gave me, so they gave me a different one which caused oral thrush and the medicine to fix that made me hyper sensitive to alcohol to the point that I vomited after I kissed my husband after he used mouthwash - truly this was the MC that just kept on giving). 

While a D&C isn't fun and does carry risks, I'd do it again if I could be asleep amd then get an ultrasound afterwards. I like that it's over quickly and I don't have to worry about dealing with miscarrying in my bathroom, not to mention the information I can get from fetal testing.

Your husband should not be blaming you for not supporting him. You carried your son for 9 months and had your entire life revolving around him. The loss he is feeling is the same as yours, and he should recognize that instead of lashing out.

If you want to stop TTC, then stop. Let yourself heal. You don't want to bring a child into this world when you're full of stress.

I understand more about the situation with your husband too. It's hard when they are so great and supportive that there's still this little gap of experience that can't quite be bridged. It's also hard sometimes to balance supporting and being supported - from both sides. It's a really hard situation, there's no easy way through it I think. Maybe something you can do for now is try convince yourself to not feel guilty. Start with the smaller steps instead of trying to feel ok right away about seeing another pregnancy. It is ok and normal for you to feel the way you are feeling, see it as a note to yourself that you are still in a stage where you need to put yourself and grieving first.

It&#39;s also hard sometimes to balance supporting and being supported - from both sides. It&#39;s a really hard situation, there&#39;s no easy way through it I think. Maybe something you can do for now is try convince yourself to not feel guilty. Start with the smaller steps instead of trying to feel ok right away about seeing another pregnancy. It is ok and normal for you to feel the way you are feeling, see it as a note to yourself that you are still in a stage where you need to put yourself and grieving first. It&#39;s not being selfish - it&#39;s just you trying to survive through it.</p>

I had 2 D&Cs for a MMC roughly 9-10 gets age last summer but was carrying until almost 5 months before it passed via a 2nd D&C. I Know you don't want to rush but not getting the process started sooner is a huge regret of mine . Everyone from my GP to my OB to my nurse at the early pregnancy clinic was on summer holidays at the time and between that and no one making it clear to me ( it was my first pregnancy ) that this would need medical management, I got my first D&C a long 3 weeks after finding MMC. It's true the more time goes on the greater the risk and more likely you are not to pass on your own. For me the miso didn't work , I def was not passing it on my own and even the first D&C couldn't get things moving

what they don't advertise is that it is a blind procedure based on grids and it can and does often fail leaving retained product if your uterus is not perfectly shaped or positioned. I find it infuriating that every D&C is not done while simultaneously US. I refused to have mine done at an AB clinic, but my cousin had hers at one and they ultrasounded the entire time and she was awake. At my hospital their policy was only to do this with a documented uterine abnormality but hello? most people would have zero clue about this. I didn't until my second D&C. Where thank god the surgeon detected it. They can also use the camera but this risks uterine scar tissue so they are hesitant. By my 2nd D&C an emergency one at the hospital a full 7 weeks after my first (yes a full 7 weeks of daily bleeding which I kept being told was normal like yourself ), it was a toss up to use the camera and risk damage or not use it and risk a 3rd D&C and infection. In the end it wasn't used, the surgeon was able to get a huge amount of tissue I was given Miso rectally after as an extra precaution and it was HORRIBLE. I had nothing left to pass. It put me into full on labour for about 16 hours when I was trying to recover. A week later I went septic but caught it very early. An ER doc called it the miscarriage that never ended

If I were you I would come back to your doctor and say you agree your‚Äôe not likely to pass on your own , that you don't want to waste time cycling with meds ( you could try ?) but yet you don't want to blindly go into another D&C after your history .

Like, these people have seen my cervix, they&#39;ve been the nurses who provided comfort to be in the OR, and I really have no clue what they looked like. I&#39;d rather be in my shoes than experiencing that &quot;no clue what they looked like&quot; from the POV of a COVID patient, absolutely, but it still just sucks so much. </p>

<p>Thanks for your kindness.</p>

There‚Äôs so much beautiful solidarity in this group!! 

Another comment mentioned the willingness to face the fear of another loss if it means we get to give birth to a healthy child someday. That totally rang true for me! My first pregnancy/miscarriage in January 2020 was really painful and traumatizing. I had never experienced so much pain!! But even through the most painful moments I remember yelling at my husband (who was terrified) I WANT TO TRY AGAIN!! I had so much clarity, like if it‚Äôs this physically and emotionally painful to experience THIS, then imagine how overwhelmingly beautiful and amazing it will be to finally have a healthy child!!

I think it‚Äôs part of the reason we flock to reddit, at least it is for me anyways! It‚Äôs not super common to experience multiple losses but when you do, there‚Äôs not a lot of support out there. There‚Äôs so much beautiful solidarity in this group!! </p>

<p>Another comment mentioned the willingness to face the fear of another loss if it means we get to give birth to a healthy child someday. That totally rang true for me! My first pregnancy/miscarriage in January 2020 was really painful and traumatizing. I had never experienced so much pain!! But even through the most painful moments I remember yelling at my husband (who was terrified) I WANT TO TRY AGAIN!! I had so much clarity, like if it‚Äôs this physically and emotionally painful to experience THIS, then imagine how overwhelmingly beautiful and amazing it will be to finally have a healthy child!! It must be worth it! </p>

My body wanted that baby so bad that it guarded it for weeks after it was gone. It did everything it could to protect and nourish it. It will do that again, and hopefully for a baby that is healthy and well and able to thrive. </p>

<p>I‚Äôve found the Expectful App to be helpful- they have a whole section of meditations for pregnancy loss. Sometimes they‚Äôre too intense for me, depending on how I‚Äôm doing emotionally. But I like having it available for when I start to spiral and need to re-focus.</p>

There is a pretty standard RPL panel that can be done. At a very high level, it checks for thyroid function, blood clotting disorders, immune factors and hormone levels. A DNA karyotype is often also ordered but if you have LC, you probably don't have a problem here. They may also want to do a physical exam such as a SIS which checks for uterine abnormalities. 

I had this done in WI in Feb of this year - it was about 25 vials of blood and came in around $2,000.

I see that you don't have fertility coverage - I recommend working with your OB and insurance to confirm that this blood work will be coded as Recurrent Miscarriages - NOT infertility. This will give you a great shot at having it covered.

If all else fails, IMHO, I would start with just the thyroid testing. Thyroid controls your sex hormones and can be a big factor in embryo quality and miscarriage (and is easy to treat with medication).

One thing I will offer is that if you opt for this testing, you may not get a solid answer as to why RPL has happened to you. At least 50% of miscarriages are a result of chromosomal error - in essence, something goes wrong when the cells are multiplying that affects the gene sequence and makes the embryo incompatible with life. This scenario is more and more prevalent as we age and isn't really treatable outside of some lifestyle and supplement changes. 

You can have a genetic test done on fetal tissue to determine if this is the case - have you had this testing done? It can be helpful in determining a path forward for your RPL diagnosis.

I hope you find answers and that you never experience another loss. Best wishes.",[],,t1_fxa5lyo,False,0,[],False,"<div class=""md""><p>First off, I&#39;m very sorry for what you&#39;ve been through.</p>

They are our best friends. My husband is happy for them and frustrated with me for my attitude toward them. I'm not unhappy for them, it's just that they are now this huge trigger that reminds me of my own loss. In fact, I don't think i feel anything (good or bad) toward them personally at all right now...I don't have room in my heart to have feelings about their situation. 

Last week they told us about seeing the heartbeat at their first ultrasound together, which is something I didn't get to see - instead that's the place where I learned, by myself, that my baby had died. I completely lost it and broke down for days after they told us and I'm still thinking about that fucking heartbeat comment. It felt cruel to include that detail. 

They'll be publicly announcing in the next few weeks, and announcements are right up there with ultrasounds as a huge trigger point for me. It's something we never did, we told literally no one while the baby was alive and I'll never get that back. I'll never see someone smile for my baby, ever. I have so much regret and shame over this and feel like I let down my baby. When they announce, it'll be a constant topic of conversation in our families and with our friends - I'm going to be included in all of it. 

I don't know how to get through this friendship. I'm avoiding them, but I can't avoid them forever and I do want to be a good friend. The mere mention of their names can send me into a spiral now. I hoped I could just get pregnant fast and it wouldn't be a problem, but that didn't happen. 

I genuinely don't think it's jealousy. But maybe it is. It just feels more like despair about my own situation. I can't flip my thought process. I've been in weekly therapy for months and it's not changing anything. I feel completely alone in my agony now, my husband keeps saying he's happy for them...he just can't understand where I'm coming from on being upset around them and he thinks I'm being a bad friend (or I assume this is what he thinks).

<p>Case in point - husband was I&#39;ll last year and was referred to a doc who he felt was <em>not</em> listening to his concerns and dismissed him. He went to another doc, got the treatment he needed and is recovering. He had to advocate for himself and he&#39;s better off for it.</p>

4) Personally if it were me I would not quit my job.

Hey there. I‚Äôm so sorry for your losses. I have a similar history to you with three losses. 1 MMC suspected at 8w ish, confirmed at 10w, 1 CP at 5 weeks, another MMC at 8 weeks after seeing the heartbeat at 6 weeks. All in less than a year, like you.

We had chromosomal testing done for the two MMCs and found that both were trisomies, but different ones (15 and 16) and these are randomly occurring so my OB, geneticist and an MFM we saw for a second opinion chalked them up to bad luck, which was very frustrating. We decided to make an appointment with the fertility clinic to explore doing IVF with PGS, even though we had no problems getting pregnant, just to select the embryo next time.

However we ended up also deciding to try ourselves even while waiting for the appointment (which had to be scheduled 2-3 months out). By this point COVID lockdowns we‚Äôre starting and I was reading lots of stories about fertility clinics not doing procedures, and I really did not want to wait for an appointment only to have it canceled or to be told we couldn‚Äôt actually start the process for months longer. We ended up getting pregnant immediately.

I will say this pregnancy has been the most stress I have ever gone through. I was waiting to miscarry it seemed like the entire time. I have been emotionally not ok and have found it very hard to function in other aspects of my life.

I am now 16 weeks and feeling better after genetic testing showed low risk for trisomies 13, 18 and 21‚Äîbut these weren‚Äôt the trisomies that doomed me in the past, and there aren‚Äôt tests available for other trisomies. The only thing that reassures me is that the other trisomies tend to end in earlier loss because they are so incompatible with fetal development that having now made it to 16 weeks must mean we are likely to be ok on that front for now. Had I done PGS testing, i think I would still feel anxiety but much less. Of course, I have no idea how long that would have taken.

<p>I can&#39;t answer the question of knowing when I&#39;m ready...because I&#39;m not, yet. But in time we both will be, and I think it&#39;s important to remember that for each of us that amount of time looks different.</p>

I‚Äôve used this lifestyle change for the past few years and it‚Äòa helped me to stay in shape and not feel deprived of all the food I like. 

So basically, I found a work out that I really enjoyed that I knew I would do regularly (spin class and running). I paired that with drinking tons of water everyday and prioritizing my sleep. I switched to having a couple glasses of wine a week instead of drinking a lot of beer and cocktails. My only restriction is that for dinner, if I have animal protein (ex. Steak) then I only eat veggies for a side. If I want carbs (pasta) than I don‚Äôt have any animal protein. That really helped keep my calories on track for the day and not feel deprived. It‚Äôs a weird trick but it made all the difference for me! 

I tracked all my calories, but I don‚Äôt anymore since I‚Äôm so used to the way I eat. 

I lost 10-15 lbs over 6 months and have stayed that way for 5 years. 

TTC right now so we‚Äôll see if it works after, but I think the important part is that I found an exercise that I liked and a way of eating that didn‚Äôt leave me craving. It took some time and I just tried to enjoy my life and the changes.

Given how early he was born, did you have a classical incision? If so, a minimum of 12 months should pass before TTC, cases where pregnancy occurs before that have higher rates of adverse outcomes for mother and child.

For me, there is some comfort in this enforced wait period. It gives me time to weigh up my feelings. It also gives me time to have every test possible to identify risk factors (a few have been found) that can be managed should we choose to try again. It gives me time to get my body as healed and as strong as it can be.

Please don't feel guilty. Your feelings are entirely normal. 80% of couples who experience stillbirth or neonatal death get pregnant again within 18 months.

Your love for your son, your despair for his loss, and your desire to raise a living child are independent feelings and completely capable of existing at the same time.

There is no dishonor or disrespect to your son in wanting to have his sibling. We would never think that of those people who after bringing a baby home, are excited to have more.

You may also consider a quality curcumin supplement. Not only is this an anti-inflammatory agent, it supports fertility in a plethora of ways. And finally, I love ashwagandha. A safe adaptogenic herb that supports fertility and also helps the body manage stress and inflammation. I truly believe that not only will these improve your emotional symptoms they can also support fertility! There is no perfect time to have a baby. I waited quite a while. I too waited until I was done with PA school. I too struggled to conceive. But I was able to. And you can to. The timing is right when you and your partner decide that it&#39;s right. I hope this helps. When you try these, let me know how you feel! I have a hunch that you are going to do great:)</p>

I too had a mmc last week, after the heartbeat stopped by my 8w4d ultrasound. I have lean PCOS and feared a MC from the very beginning, so I only told my husband and my mom. Then when my HCG stopped doubling properly at 5ish weeks, I knew it wasn‚Äôt looking good, so we informed my husbands mom as well (just Incase anything happened). 

It was only after the mmc was confirmed that we decided to tell the rest of our immediate family only. I told my two best friends for support and my husband told one of his; but... he has another friend who is married to a girl who thrives off of gossip (she and all her friends) and I specifically asked him not to tell this guy because I was so afraid he would tell her and it would get out. Naturally, he told him.  I was beyond livid - I realize he‚Äôs going through a tough time too, but this felt so hurtful and like my trust was violated since I pleaded with him not to. I was extremely angry, bawled my eyes out and couldn‚Äôt even look at him for the next day or so (dramatic, yes, but it felt like he made the hardest situation even harder for me and it was just too much to handle). 

Eventually, I just had to trust that this person wouldn‚Äôt share our personal news with anyone. I made my husband call him back and explain how I felt about him knowing this news, and stress the importance of trusting them with our personal info. We live in a tight community and I wanted to make it very clear if this gets out, it would be devastating for us.

The announcement is a huge trigger for me since it&#39;s something we never got to do, we never told a soul while our baby was alive and I regret that deeply. I&#39;ll never see someone&#39;s face happy for that baby, never. So it&#39;s hard to hear happy congrats for others. </p>

I don't have any experience with TPO antibodies and all those meds/issues, except what I've read in subs like this -- which often shows many fertility issues. Somehow they seem to differ and not have a pattern. I am sorry you're dealing with this and hope that treatment plan alone helps you.

For background, I had 5 losses in a row, a success, another loss, and then switched to IVF.   (MC at 10.5 weeks, MMC at 10.5(passed at 7.5), CP, CP, PUL, success, CP, current)

I think moving to IVF when its not ""necessary"" can be a tough choice and has so many pros and cons. It is SO hard to know what to do, so I understand your hesitation and questions. I did the same thing.

I turned 31 the week after I first conceived. I was 33.8 (almost 34) when I had success, with 5 losses beforehand. Nobody knew why, allllll testing showed everything was fine, and I had also miscarried a chromosomally normal baby. IVF was discussed then but the RE didn't think I needed it and my insurance didn't cover it so it would have been 35-40k, probably. So we just kept trying, especially because the MCs, the CPs, and the PUL are ""somewhat unrelated"" in reason. Ugh.

75% or more of people with repeat loss are ""unexplained,"" which SUCKS. But actually 85% or more do have success. So that's a wonderful statistic, for sure. And I guess I was part of that stat. Took us a lot of heartbreak, but we did have success. I think this fact and the fact that all your losses were quite early do play a factor in your decision. Especially with now being medicated -- it seems your chances of a healthy pregnancy now that you're medicated have gone up, for sure.

As far as your CPs, there is a chance that they had chromosome issues AND there is a chance they didn't. Some are caused by lining issues or even ovulation that isn't at the ideal time for the egg. (Doing a medicated FET can sometimes ""solve"" issues there -- often it ""fixes"" some timing or lining issues.)

Your AMH is average so that itself isn't a concern, but your AMH can't tell the whole story. Your AFC being 6-8 is a bigger concern than your AMH. A ""normal"" AFC is 3-8 per ovary, so 6-8 is on the lower end for sure. FSH helps you know how you'll respond to stimulation meds, and your normal number is a good indicator for IVF, too.

Your odds of conceiving again without assistance seem good. And your odds of having a successful pregnancy this way are actually statistically decent, too!  So many would be inclined to say ""try again!"" and see how it goes before seeking further assistance.

But, let me give this perspective. At 32, right before I had success, my AMH was 2.4 and my AFC was 14. When we decided to TTC a 2nd, 3 years later, my AFC had PLUMMETED and was now 0.54. What? How? That was FAST. I was now 35 and .54 is below average even at 35.

Due to this, our journey to #2 sent us right back to the RE...who told us we could try naturally or with fertility meds for awhile and maybe conceive, even with low reserve, but that we needed to move through the options more quickly if we truly wanted another biological child. We tried, conceived, and had yet another CP. Our 6th loss.

I was like, F this, lets do IVF -- which was an easier decision this time due to the great insurance fertility coverage that we did not previously have. We jumped in, had to do 2 stimulation cycles, and have had success so far with IVF...at age 36.

If I were you, and I had great coverage, I'd probably do IVF now. WHY? Because your eggs are the youngest they will ever be. If you have a success naturally anytime soon you will then be looking at 2+ years down the road before you try again. You WILL have less eggs, your AMH/AFC will likely drop some (even if they don't plummet quickly), and you may not have the coverage you have now. PLUS you'll be doing IVF with a child around, which adds more factors.  OR EVEN if you try again and have a couple more losses instead of a success, you will still have gone through a lot, your eggs will have aged, etc...

IVF is not a cure all. It is not a guarantee. And you seem to realize that. It IS tough, emotionally and physically, and it is expensive and time consuming. BUT if you want more than 1 child, it's often a better option to start sooner rather than later.  As my RE says, ""IVF fixes everything we know HOW to fix.""

MANY people put off more invasive treatment for a long time - due to cost, time, or just the general invasiveness. And a large majority end up regretting that because the older you are, the harder all of it really is.

Best of luck.  


EDIT to add -- if you were to do IVF and get embryos, it isn't out of the realm of normal to keep trying without assistance even with embryos banked. And return to those embryos if it becomes necessary.

I know I am, thanks to many of you ladies, my support group, my counselor, and my immediate family. But its still the whole not having him that makes me feel less than a mother. That is, until two things happened. First, I read a book (suggested by either someone on this sub or over on <a href=""/r/babyloss"">r/babyloss</a>) titled <em>You Are the Mother of All Mothers</em> and second, my family and friends started asking questions. When they learned that we had pictures of Ethan, everyone suddenly wanted to see him. They wanted to hear about his birth, his 3 precious days on Earth, and tragically, the night we lost him. </p>

<p>So basically, I&#39;ve just started to feel like people (outside of the amazing women like you all who know what it is to lose) acknowledge that Ethan existed, he matters, and that I am a mother. And I need that. We as moms ALL need that. I see you. &lt;3</p>

Especially when you‚Äôve just gone through a loss or having a fertility treatment not work out. I did really struggle a couple months ago. I was pregnant. We were 3 months behind my brother and sister. We‚Äôve all struggled with infertility so we were all excited and hopeful that this was it because the cousins being close together would have been perfect. When I miscarried (around Mother‚Äôs Day) they were heartbroken too. They were sensitive but it was just so devastating. I don‚Äôt know why things don‚Äôt work out. I hate that we have to go through this loss, waiting, and constant let down. We are here for you. You are not alone with how you feel. It will get better either way eventually. I‚Äôve seen the other side of this pain so I know it‚Äôs possible to not hurt like this anymore whether we have a healthy baby soon or not. I wish happiness for me and I wish happiness for you no matter what that looks like. You aren‚Äôt alone on this journey. Thanks for sharing.‚ù§Ô∏è</p>

<p>I&#39;m grateful my husband is the man he is. He left it up to me to decide what I was comfortable with, without any pressure. He&#39;s now snuggled up with me on the couch, despite always being warm, and even let me choose the TV for the night (it was supposed to be his turn). </p>

<p>One of these days might be normal again. Trying for a little bit at a time, and each bit is so hard to reclaim. I tried to start back at work this week, and it was devastating and exhausting to talk around the loss. I ended more days with  migraines than not, and nightmares. It&#39;s probably time to reach out to the councilor, and get on the schedule for more therapy.</p>

Low dose aspirin is THOUGHT to help prevent early miscarriage where there is a possibility of a blood clotting disorder. In order to get tested for those, ideally you need to be 3 months out from your most recent loss because the antibody levels need to normalise first. The main one you want to get tested for is called lupus anticoagulant, but there's others. If you bruise easily or get nosebleeds generally in life, it's worth asking for a blood test if you are not pg again within 3 months. Remember that even low dose aspirin can be dangerous with certain conditions (I think asthma is one??) so you should be asking your doctor if there is any reason you shouldn't give it a go, if you want to give it a shot.


You should also ask if progesterone supplements are right for you too in a future pg. This is another area of early MC prevention that is under clinical trials at the moment; like aspirin theory, some people swear by it, some people think it's a load of old tosh. 


In terms of conceiving again, once you get your first period you're on the same odds as anyone else who hasn't had a loss. You can absolutely try before your first period but I've never managed it despite trying. You will likely be told not to attempt it, this is usually advice given for dating purposes if you are successful, but I would ask if there are any other reasons as to why you shouldn't. If for example you want to be tested for weird antibody shit, you may be advised to wait (advice I duly ignored).

They did a normal ultrasound and then a transvaginal to check for endometriosis as well. </p>

<p>Oddly enough, when I was going through the routine of checking a possible LH surge, it was never detected on the tests so I gave up hope with that. </p>

<p>I hope you find the answers you‚Äôre looking for! Good luck!</p>

Because of covid, I had to go by myself. Checked in and learned--surprise!--they had me signed up for bloodwork. That's not what we had discussed, just an AFC ultrasound. Off to a great start. 

Doctor comes in and asks why I don't want to do bloodwork. Well, for starters: I just did labs in November. During our consult last week you told me I didn't have to do hormonal labs again. You didn't tell me in advance that I would have to spring for a $1,000 genetics test. Oh and this is all to prep for IVF, which we hadn't agreed was a next step.

Then the ultrasound. The last time I saw an ultrasound was when we miscarried last time. It sucked not having my husband there. The good news: AFC was good! The not good news: my lining is thin, 5.6 mm, 1DPO. 

The doctor had told me that we would go over results the next day in our consult (and my husband would be there). But instead I was half naked on a table by myself learning that my lining was thin. 3 minutes and $225 later I was ready to GTFO. 

I cried on the way home. My husband: ""But now we know--and now we can do something about it."" True. But then I thought about my doctor who ordered the original labs and asked me if I was \*sure\* I did my labs when she told me to, because my estrogen was low. And then I thought about a few weeks ago when I revisited those labs and emailed my RN about the low estradiol levels. ""They're fine."" Well guess what, Alice. They're not fine and it's probably played a role in us not getting pregnant. Fuck you very much. 

Why is the medical community so against advocating for and supporting women? Why didn't my OB tell me we should do an ultrasound so we could check my lining months ago? Why didn't my RN listen to me? Instead, we've been trying and trying and nothing since our \*second\* miscarriage in February.
