Your lines will be so faint at 8 DPO that you should barely be able to see them. http://imgur.com/wrsQ19Y here are my tests from last week. The earliest I got a line was 9 DPO (but remember every pregnancy is different so getting one at 8 DPO is fine too! Its all good JShell). They may seem like they are not getting much darker in the beginning but that is just because hcg is still so low right now. 

**Things to keep in mind if you continue testing:**

*Remember, all different hpt brands have different amounts of dye so on one test brand a line might be so faint you can barely see it where another might have a nice strong positive. 

*Only use your fmu for testing. 

*Don't dehydrate yourself just to get good lines on a pregnancy test. You are pregnant, you need water. Because of this I think you should use fmu only while testing. 

*Try not to obsess about progression and line thickness. At the end of the day pregnancy tests were designed to be a yes/no test and never meant to show just ""how pregnant"" you are. 

*Stay away from TTC forums. They have always just left me panicked for no reason.


So sorry you are feeling this way.

EDIT: I misread this as you being worried about ectopic because of your faint line. Sorry, I am just out of it.

Weighing risk is so personal.

Since you asked, here are my thoughts/circumstances so far:


Care provider:

I've chosen to work with a midwifery group attached to a hospital that is nationally rated ""[Baby Friendly]( http://www.babyfriendlyusa.org/)."" I have this option because i am a low-risk pregnancy. 

 I want the comfort of knowing that help is immediately available (NICU and OR if necessary) in the attached hospital. Their philosophy is hands off for prenatal care and birth. Their c-section rate is 15%. 

The other hospital near me has a c-section rate of 35-40% and abandoned the Baby Friendly certification because their clientele was seeking more and more elective c-sections with separation from the baby in a nursery). In my state, midwife-attended home birth is illegal. And I live in an apartment building with thin walls. If not for those factors, I might consider home birth.


Doulas:

I haven't thought through a birth plan, but I have ideas and will use those wishes to help me interview doulas.

For a doula, I plan to use Birthways, a national service that offers classes and good matches with doulas (delivery doulas, postpartum, lactation coaches, etc).


Labor management:

My midwife group *only* offers active management in the third stage of labor, and not earlier. You will not be admitted if you arrive too early. They strongly encourage the use of a doula to help you determine timing, and even offer free doula services if you can't afford one. No one discusses induction until you've gotten to 42 weeks. Other alternative modes (acupuncture, movement, massage, etc) are used to induce before 42 weeks. Breech presentation is handled by alternative modes as well, then if still unresolved by spontaneous labor starts, an ob is called in from the hospital to take over the birth (which pretty much guarantees a c-section) <-- this situation scares me most.


Pain management:

I'm not sure. I don't want an epidural for many reasons. ( And, related, I don't want pitocin or other synthetic oxytocin.) The idea of laying on my back to push seems utterly unnatural to me, and so I desperately don't want to lose the ability to move, walk, wiggle, squat, or whatever I might feel like I need to do to work through pain. I'm nervous/anxious/curious about the pain. I know it will be outrageous, and unlike anything ive felt before, but i believe that if i have coping mechanisms and know the contractions move along with short breaks, i can handle it. Moreso, i believe that the pain will help me understand the process, and so will help me help myself labor (if that makes sense). It's part of the process I *want* to experience. So I plan on working with a doula to develop coping skills and skills to rreally listen to my body.

So much to think about.

In short, she told me to get a life!  I'm being flippant here, but it's the TL;DR of our conversation.  

She made me see that in the year I've been TTC, my sole self-given purpose in life has been to have a baby.  And as my pregnancies have failed, I've felt that I'm failing the one thing I am supposed to accomplish.  So it's no wonder I was feeling lower than low, ready to die and give up on my life.  How could I feel good about myself if I deemed myself a complete and utter failure at my one purpose?

She encouraged me to develop the other aspects of my life, broken in four broad categories.

**Hobbies**: Currently, I have none. I think this is a huge part of my problem.  I need new things to learn and focus my mind on, other than obsessing over my failed pregnancies and TTC endeavors.  I have signed up for a guitar class and a belly dancing class through my local community college that will run over the summer, and am looking forward to learning something new. 

**Social**: Make plans with friends.  Make new friends.  This is hard for me since I am pretty reclusive, and I am usually content to stay in with my husband every night.  But I am going to try to initiate more, and stay in touch better.

**Spiritual**: Does not need to mean religious, but taking time every day to do something that brings you peace.  Can be meditation, prayer, yoga, a hot bath, journaling, etc.  I am definitely enjoying this part so far.

**Physical**: Taking care of myself physically, exercising and eating right, not smoking or abusing alcohol.  I am setting fitness goals for myself, getting back into lifting weights and running again (never felt comfortable doing much while pregnant).

Also... feeling good because my husband and I celebrated our first wedding anniversary over the weekend.  We got away to the beach, stayed at a romantic B&B, did an 11-mile hike through the forest, ate an amazing Italian dinner, drank a lot of wine, rode a roller coaster, and just had a blast!

Home birth isn't really a thing in here so we are going to hospital, would have chosen it anyway. I'm not actually afraid at all. Last time I gave birth it went okay for me. Main reason still is that almost every woman I know me included have told about this urge that comes during end of third trimester, it could be described as ""I don't care how this baby comes out but it has to come out and it has to do it now, or even better, yesterday.""

I'll explain how it went for me last time, nothing interesting happened, sorry:

03 water broke, I was so excited that I couldn't sleep anymore so went to play WoW.

06 contractions started, headed to shower and shaved my legs, mid wifes have never seen hairy legs right?

08:30 GoT season 3 started and I was determined to watch the first episode. We had to pause during contractions but I did it!

10 Hospital and to the nice small pool. Honestly, it wasn't for me, I felt like a whale stuck in water that wasn't deep enough to move properly.

12 Started shakind between contractions almost violently so I was stuck in that pain feeling all the time, it was horrible.

13 Epidural, god bless medical science. Even took nap

17:30 Finally open but not feeling need to push but throwed up.

Home birth isn&#39;t really a thing in here so we are going to hospital, would have chosen it anyway. I&#39;m not actually afraid at all. Last time I gave birth it went okay for me. Main reason still is that almost every woman I know me included have told about this urge that comes during end of third trimester, it could be described as &quot;I don&#39;t care how this baby comes out but it has to come out and it has to do it now, or even better, yesterday.&quot;</p>

<p>I&#39;ll explain how it went for me last time, nothing interesting happened, sorry:</p>

<p>03 water broke, I was so excited that I couldn&#39;t sleep anymore so went to play WoW.</p>

<p>06 contractions started, headed to shower and shaved my legs, mid wifes have never seen hairy legs right?</p>

<p>08:30 GoT season 3 started and I was determined to watch the first episode. We had to pause during contractions but I did it!</p>

<p>10 Hospital and to the nice small pool. Honestly, it wasn&#39;t for me, I felt like a whale stuck in water that wasn&#39;t deep enough to move properly.</p>

<p>12 Started shakind between contractions almost violently so I was stuck in that pain feeling all the time, it was horrible.</p>

<p>13 Epidural, god bless medical science. Even took nap</p>

<p>17:30 Finally open but not feeling need to push but throwed up.</p>

I have 2 high-risk conditions--an antibody that puts the baby at risk for heart block (as bad as it sounds), and an elevated risk of obstetric cholestasis, which can result in fetal death. So all my decisions are from the standpoint of someone who has had to think about the fact that there may be very real reasons for interventions--either one of these conditions can result in a stillbirth (or, the need to implant a pacemaker at birth, in some cases). 

Thus, a birth center or home birth do not feel like options for me. I might have considered them otherwise. But on some level, I need to know that if heart block or cholestasis occurs, my baby will have a chance to survive. 

I want to work with a doula, so that my husband does not have the entire burden of caring for me and advocating for our wishes. Anyone have advice on what to look for in a doula? 

I am scared of induced labor. If I develop cholestasis, they will probably have to induce me. I say ""have to"", because I believe in the medical necessity of this. My cousin had cholestasis, it was not detected, and her baby died within the hour. So, if they tell me to induce due to to cholestasis, I am sure I will have questions, but I will not refuse. 

I am scared of an emergency C section. Not so scared of a planned C section (if that were to happen for some reason...?). But the idea of being rushed away and cut open without knowing what was happening--is very, very scary to me. 

I am nervous about the pain of labor, but not scared. More like...interested in what it will be like. I would like to give birth unmedicated if possible. I am nervous about knowing when to question, and how much to question about interventions or medications.

What are your thoughts on the birth process?

I haven't been around in a little while (work and stuff).
 
I'm still considering the book club idea. There wasn't much of a response, and no one volunteered for the non-pregnancy book club that was brought up to balance, so I think the idea may be back-burnered. 

BUT...

I originally had the book club idea because of one book in particular: 
[Pushed: The Painful Truth About Childbirth and Modern Maternity Care](http://www.amazon.com/Pushed-Painful-Childbirth-Modern-Maternity/dp/0738211664/ref=ed_oe_p), by Jennifer Block, and Block's companion blog [PushedBirth](http://pushedbirth.com/).

*Pushed* offers an overview of the American approach to birth. Based on historical data, meta-analyses of medical literature, ethnographic data, in-depth interviews, participant observation, Block explains the limits of a woman's choice in childbirth and maternity care, ranging from hospital care to midwifery, as determined modern medicine, historical trends, changing social standards over time, and more.

I am overwhelmed at what I have learned from this book. Mind-blowing doesn't even come close to describing it. A warning: this book can be terrifying, enraging, and reassuring all at once, and repeatedly nearly on every page. If you are faint-of-heart, or feel you already have a firm grip on your birth experience, and are confident in your decisions, I'd *strongly* recommend you avoid it. 

I chose to read it for a very particular reason: *all* of my friends who gave birth for the first time had planned a vaginal birth at a hospital or birthing center, but *none* got it. Every last one ended up with an emergency c-section. I wondered why, and this book seemed like it might have an answer. (Several have gone on to successful midwife-assisted VBAC at home or at a birthing center).

After reading, I feel empowered to make decisions and ask questions about things during the birth process that previously I would have just taken for granted as ""medically necessary"" or never had the presence of mind to question. And so it has gotten me thinking:

What are you all thinking about birth? Anything yet? Are you planning to work with a doula? Writing a birth plan? Planning a home birth? Scheduling induction? Choosing elective c-section? Have previous birth experiences influenced your choices this time?

Are you scared at all? What are you afraid of?

I am working with a very hands-off midwifery group attached to a hospital (free-standing birthing centers are illegal in my state). I will work with a doula, and now have some pretty specific ""over my dead body"" wishes about how to manage my birth. 

I am scared out of my fucking mind. I am terrified of synthetic induction. And *terrified* doesn't even come close to how I feel about having a c-section. I'm afraid that at some point in the process, when I am most vulnerable, that my choice of how to handle my own body and pain will be taken from me, and that I will be trapped in a process I cannot get out of. I cannot begin to describe how terrified I am of being strapped down to a table, awake and aware, and numbed from the chest down for major abdominal surgery. (In the book, there is an incredibly powerful chapter reporting on many women who equated their birth experience as ""medical rape."")

I am *not* afraid of the pain of labor, or a lengthy labor, but I am afraid of a long recovery from abdominal surgery. I am afraid of complications and recovery from episiotomy. I am afraid of not having the presence of mind during labor to stop procedures I do not want (like pitocin or episiotomy).

Edit: I think this goes w/o saying here... This discussion is meant to be civil discussion, and not judgment. Each birth experience is individual and I know we all respect and support each other here, so please, if you were thinking a little judgy, remember the golden rule: if you can't find something nice to say, say nothing at all.

One app says baby girl is the size is a turnip and Ovia says she's the size of a pomegranate. This week my nausea has finally subsided some, but if I wait too long to eat I get horribly dizzy, so I have to remember to feed my little girl every couple of hours! I feel little twitches and pokes from time to time but I'm not always positive it's the baby. We've also decided on the name Lily! It's so real now knowing that she's a girl and having THE name. 

We took a trip to Illinois to visit my dad and grandmother over the weekend. My grandmother fed me all weekend, resulting in a substantial bump increase that I'm sure is mostly bloat. Guess we'll see after I'm home for a day or two. It was mostly smooth but somewhat, uh, interesting at times this weekend. My dad's wife takes a cocktail of mood stabilizers and pain killers and who knows what else that drive her on extreme ups and downs from day to day. I feel really bad for him because she's so unstable and basically spends her days draining his bank account while he's out working way too hard for a man his age to support her. I wish he'd leave so he can just focus on taking care of himself, but I guess that's none of my business. 

Anyway....I start work in 2 weeks and we move in a little over 3 weeks so life will be crazy! Packing, moving, trying to build a work wardrobe that fits...getting my dog used to 8 hours alone every day. Poor little thing. I feel terrible about that but I guess lots of dogs do it.

Edited for grammar. ",[],,t1_cqxz570,False,0,[],False,"<div class=""md""><p>17 weeks today! One app says baby girl is the size is a turnip and Ovia says she&#39;s the size of a pomegranate. This week my nausea has finally subsided some, but if I wait too long to eat I get horribly dizzy, so I have to remember to feed my little girl every couple of hours! I feel little twitches and pokes from time to time but I&#39;m not always positive it&#39;s the baby. We&#39;ve also decided on the name Lily! It&#39;s so real now knowing that she&#39;s a girl and having THE name. </p>

<p>We took a trip to Illinois to visit my dad and grandmother over the weekend. My grandmother fed me all weekend, resulting in a substantial bump increase that I&#39;m sure is mostly bloat. Guess we&#39;ll see after I&#39;m home for a day or two. It was mostly smooth but somewhat, uh, interesting at times this weekend. My dad&#39;s wife takes a cocktail of mood stabilizers and pain killers and who knows what else that drive her on extreme ups and downs from day to day. I feel really bad for him because she&#39;s so unstable and basically spends her days draining his bank account while he&#39;s out working way too hard for a man his age to support her. I wish he&#39;d leave so he can just focus on taking care of himself, but I guess that&#39;s none of my business. </p>

<p>Anyway....I start work in 2 weeks and we move in a little over 3 weeks so life will be crazy! Packing, moving, trying to build a work wardrobe that fits...getting my dog used to 8 hours alone every day. Poor little thing. I feel terrible about that but I guess lots of dogs do it. I&#39;m totally rambling. I&#39;ll shut up! Have a great Monday everyone!</p>

U/S after 1 week of BC means I can begin follistim next week. Received two big bags of meds. But two almost totally unrelated-to-fertility stresses left me nearly in tears in the office:

- Questioned my doctor about the need for ICSI (husband's sperm quality has been the only saving grace of this whole debacle, and Internet research strongly suggested it wasn't indicated in our case.) It took a lot of back and forth before I was finally OK with it, and it still starts to give me the feeling like I'm playing games with my potential kids' lives, and maybe I shouldn't be doing IVF at all. But the hardest part of having these conversations is that I'm sitting there with no underwear on and a paper napkin over my naked legs. It's so fucking hard to be a diplomat and an accountant and a patient. But I thought that would be the only battle I'd have to get into...

- Then I found out during the scheduling/meds tutorial portion that somefuckinghow I came in for my appointment ON THE WRONG DAY. That I was scheduled for tomorrow! And this is the SECOND time this has happened with this scheduler (once I gave myself the trigger shot on the wrong day.) Look. I'm paying attention as hard as I can. This doesn't happen to me at work. This doesn't happen to me at the dentist. If I'm fucking up scheduling because infertility is making me stupid, FINE. I'll take responsibility for that. BUT I CAN'T FIX IT. I can't pay attention any harder than I can! I habitually repeat back the date and time to the person who makes the appointment. Did I do that last week, when I made the appointment in question? I have no idea. I can't prove it. I write everything down that I can. I put it on my calendar as soon as I can. But somehow something's still not getting through, and I can't work harder than I am. 

I'm less furious now about this than I was twenty minutes ago because, checking through my emails, I can see how the appointment information was there (in a PDF calendar attachment... in an email chain that already had attachments...) But that level of imparting/confirming information would be kind of iffy even where I work (normal boring office.) In a medical situation, where there's physical and emotional and financial and scheduling stuff going on at the same time, I can't see any fucking reason why someone doesn't send me off with an appointment card with the date and time on it, same way they do at the dentist.

I'm just so frustrated with myself and the situation. I know it's not 100% the scheduler's fault, but I'm so frustrated with her, too (when this happened the last time, I told her, ""It would be a big help if you wrote this stuff down, like this,"" and still it didn't happen, and still there was another fuckup, and she doesn't pay the price for that. I do.)

1. on the 1st of each month we post a book in the Alum Post (with the list of EDDs).

3. People who want to discuss can reply to the book post within the alum thread on the 30th.

Interested?

I&#39;m also trying to spend time packing since we&#39;ll be moving soon but every time I start I wear myself out and get worried about picking up heavy things. I would like to get out and walk but being outside of the house by myself is sadly a huge issue for me, that&#39;s where my anxieties are most prevalent. My anxiety is mostly of the social sort so unless I have someone I know and trust with me, I&#39;m a huge mess. </p>

Me: Er...OK, and how would that work?

DH: Well, you just stop worrying! Because it won't help anything. So you just don't worry.

Me: Yes, that seems like a good idea in theory, but a *little* more difficult in practice!

Sigh. Sure, and we can just tell all the people with anxiety problems to stop feeling anxious, and all the people with depression to stop feeling depressed, and all of the mental health problems in the world will magically be fixed. It'll be awesome. :/

Age and spouse's age: I'm 32, he's almost 30. 

Where do you live: DC Metro area

How long trying: About 6 months. Mandatory benched for 2.

Describe your positives and the results: Got our first BFP in January (cp), took a month off, started using OPKs and then got another in April. Constant testing should have tipped me off because the line never got as dark as the control. Just finished miscarrying. 

Any changes from the last positive that you're trying to make: I am now ""recurrent"" - so getting blood work done and continuing to monitor with OPKs. 

Where are you in your cycle today: If miscarriage counts as day 1, then CD 8.

Any diagnoses?: Ehlers Danlos Syndrome - a benign connective tissue disorder, verdict is out on whether it's associated with miscarriage. Nothing to do about it though. 

Name 5 random favorite things: Picnics, wine, yoga, photography, hiking.

I thought I would hate this part but it was great. She managed to reassure or explain or help with each person's thing but also generalize it to the group and pregnancy. It was like getting your own appointment with a midwife and getting to sit in on the appointments of lots of other women. Then we did about 45 mins of yoga. If you are an experienced yoga practitioner and you've been keeping up with it during your pregnancy it would have been on the easy side, but she had us hold poses for a good long while so even easier poses required solid work and some good focus on breath. None of the poses themselves were advanced and they were all very well adapted for pregnant ladies. I was one of the earliest along there. Most other women had nice huge bumps. One lady is due this week! It wasn't intimidating and people were at all different levels and ability. She gave lots of modifications for poses if something didn't work for you and encouraged breaks and water. We had a few folks who had never done yoga before, including my friend who went with me, and the instructor was great about making sure everything was easy to follow. I feel wonderful today and nicely sore. I am definitely going back and finally have the motivation to start my at-home practice back up again.

For my CP it wasn't much more than a regular period. This time I was almost 7 weeks along, but ultrasound showed only 4 weeks - so again, the bleeding was lighter than a period but definitely dark and muscousy. Spotted for 5 days, only had what I would consider ""period like blood"" for a day. Honestly, with the CP the cramps were intense. This time it was horrible back pain. A heating pad helped quite a lot. 

*When did you cycles stabilize after?* 
For my cp, it stabilized almost immediately. I am still waiting for the next one as the bleeding just stopped yesterday. 

*How was your support network?* 
I feel like I have a wonderful support network. However, I think it's best to gather a bunch of different people for support. My parents are very matter-of-fact and positive, and my good friend will just let me wallow. Both types are helpful. Having said that, nobody I know in the real world has had a miscarriage, so that's why I am here. 

*How was your SO?* 
The first one hit him really hard, this one too but he is more optimistic than I am. He is extremely supportive. Personally, I think it's harder to cope when you are the one experiencing all of the symptoms around the clock. 

*How long did you wait to try again? How successful has it been?*

We waited a month after the cp, and then got pregnant on the second cycle (which I am not miscarrying). The doctor wants us to wait 6 weeks for blood tests before we start trying again.

What is your experience with bleeding? How long does it last?


I had very little bleeding. I wasn't even sure I was miscarrying until it was confirmed on the ultrasound. I ended up in the emergency room because I had contractions and the pain was too much for me to handle. I had a shot of pain relief and took NOS gas until it stopped. I also had an infection that I hadn't realised (it was a missed miscarriage at 11 1/2 weeks) and required IV antibiotics for that. After I went home, I passed clots spontaneously for the next 2 weeks but still the bleeding was no worse than a period. It all stopped after 3 weeks. 

When did you cycles stabilize after?

The next period came 2-3 weeks later. It was incredibly heavy, it was almost to the point of having to go to the hospital for blood loss but it slowed down after 2 days. I then had bleeding for another 3 weeks but it got increasingly lighter. 

How was your support network? How was your SO?

My support network was mixed. My SO was brilliant. He stayed up all night and held me while I cried. He got me out of the house and made sure I ate and encouraged me to see people again. My family, best friend and his granny were incredibly supportive and talking it through with my family and best friend really helped me get through it. I got an incredibly strong impression from his parents that I should 'get over it' and they criticized me for still grieving a week later. His friends pretended it had never happened despite all knowing about the pregnancy and the first night I went out with them, they all ignored me completely, probably due to not knowing what to say, and I felt awful. It took weeks to feel comfortable seeing any of them again. 


How long did you wait to try again?

We are not trying at the moment due to money troubles from complicated visa problems. The pregnancy was unplanned (but very much wanted) and the plan now is to wait until we get married and I have permanent residency before trying again. There is a lot of fear for both of us that it will happen again and I don't know that I can go through that again. 

Any complications related to your recovery?

The only complication I had was the infection from the missed miscarriage. Once it was over there were no more drs visits as they are only paid for when you are actually pregnant. There does not seem to be a follow up appointment available for miscarriages. As far as I am aware, everything is physically ok now.

*What is your experience with bleeding? How long does it last?*

I miscarried at ~8 weeks. My experience was that I bled very heavily for 1-2 days, heavily for another 3 days, then spotted for about another week and a half.

*When did you cycles stabilize after?*

My first period came 31 days after the miscarriage/heaviest bleeding. I suspect that I did not ovulate that cycle. My second cycle was a mess and lasted 41 days. My third cycle was more normal and I ovulated around C22. 

*How was your support network?*

Generally my support network has been good, although I think you do find that people who you thought would be supportive avoid you, and people who you thought would be less supportive somehow come through like absolute champs. You just never really know who you can rely on until it happens. 

*How was your SO?*

My husband has been...OK. I think he just didn't feel the miscarriage as deeply as I did, which seems to be pretty common. He mostly tries to be supportive but I can tell that he doesn't really get it.

*How long did you wait to try again? How successful has it been?*

We tried again after my first period, so cycles two and three. Cycle two was pretty much a loss, the timing was all wrong and I think both of us had a lot of hangups to work through. Sex was tricky at first. I started feeling more myself again on cycle three and we fortunately conceived again, so we'll see how that goes. At first I was overjoyed, then I was just plain terrified, now I'm settling down more into quiet hope/light paranoia.

*Any complications related to your recovery?*

I believe I had a tiny bit of retained tissue since I still had HCG in my system even after my first period started. It didn't cause me any major problems, though. Luckily I did not end up needing a D&C. The main complications have been mental ones, I think. Sometimes it feels almost like PTSD when I have a flashback, or bad dreams that cause me to wake up screaming, or anxiety attacks about miscarrying my current pregnancy. You lose something after a miscarriage, your innocence, your naivety, your positivity that bad things happen to other people and not to you. Trying to work through that has been the hardest part of this whole situation, I think. 

There can also be a lot of anger when you start TTCing again, the idea that you shouldn't be having to do this, that you should be at X week right now, and it's just not fun any more. Getting pregnant again is suddenly not a light-hearted hope, but a desperate need and every lost month feels like a dagger in the heart. Holidays become emotional minefields, and jealousy of people who are able to have successful pregnancies (especially in the month you would have been due) is hard to avoid. You start wondering if you'll ever be pregnant again, or if you'll end up with a long string of miscarriages and losses with nothing to show for it.

At the end of every gardening day, I wash them with soap and water and let them dry.  And then I take my nail brush and give everything a good scrub before I go do anything else.</p>

Aaand sudden breakdown in aisle 8. Over baby food. For eff's sake brain. So now it's a purposeful steer clear. 

And avoiding that checkout line if there's a stroller. 

And I have completely avoided two hairstylists, and now my pharmacy tech knows *everything*, I get the sad smiles of compassion when I pick up my antidepressants. I send my husband now. 

Skipping aisles in stores if there's small kids or babies. 

Panicking when a nice Mom makes her toddler wave hi. Smile and walk briskly.

Reddit name: Biscotti_monster

Any meaning behind that?: I love food and Italy

Age and spouse's age: Me 26, husband 29

Where do you live: Texas :)

How long trying: Stopped BC in July 2014, trying since September 2014

Describe your positives and the results: First cycle resulted in a BFP, we actually thought ""wow that was almost too easy!"" And jinxed ourselves it seems. Baby stopped developing at 5w4d and after a long drawn out series of scans, hopeful thinking, and zero further development we had a D&C at 9 weeks in November. Two cycles after, another BFP in February 2015. Had one day of intense nausea at what I thought was barely 4 weeks (actually was 5), then no symptoms until 2 weeks later got an intense pain associated with a bowel movement. After that pain dissipated there was a lingering twinge on the left side. Waited out the weekend and had another intense bout of nausea on Monday so checked it out, ectopic. We actually had a heartbeat that time measuring 7 weeks, little one was just in the wrong place :( so had to have emergency laparoscopy in March 2015 and lost the left tube. Now we're waiting for my body to get back at this again. 

Any changes from the last positive that you're trying to make: Not really. Doing my best to exercise regularly, eat healthily, and not worry too much. Trying to reduce caffeine intake. 

Where are you in your cycle today: Who knows. 40 days since surgery

Any diagnoses? ""bad luck""

Anecdotally, I did get bad withdrawals on SSRIs and  my understanding is that this is not uncommon, so you may need to prepare your self for that happening.  I know some SSRIs, such as zoloft, have been blamed in Australia for bringing out suicidal tendencies *while* withdrawing.  They are no longer used in children (and I think teens) in Australia for this reason.  With the stresses of TTC, I imaging this could be amplified.  So if you go off them, I think having a plan in place is important and that you are very smart to ask.

For me, the point I can identify when my the haze starts to lift and I can think clearer (not a cure, but able to deal) is when I am in a routine of exercising.  For me the only thing that really works is regular, routine exercise. 3-4 times a week on the same days (usually) that I do not skip.  One day off can really throw me.  I hate cardio, so heavy lifting/power lifting is it.  So this is my management suggestion.

How long I have had it (a while they think based on the numbers) and whether it preceded and caused depression or whether it merely amplified it I don't know. I am guessing though, you have already had this assessed, but as it can also pop up in previously undiagnosed people after pregnancy, I would consider a recheck if you haven't already.

It can be a rough ride and anecdotally I think for many the ups and downs of TTC combined with coming off SSRIs may be very difficult, but going in prepared and maybe even taking a month or so not TTC while going off the SSRIs may be useful (although who wants to hear that as an answer!).

I think that SSRIs can be 100% necessary during TTC and pregnancy for some people and it's a decision you need to make for yourself, with your doctor. But for me, I'd have to be REALLY, really depressed (like, suicidal depressed) to get back on an SSRI. Incoming wall of text.

Backstory - I started having panic attacks when I was 17 and got put on SSRIs. I was then diagnosed with hypothyroidism. The doctors think that my panic attacks began because of my thyroid, but then continued because they became a learned habit, if that makes sense. For instance, my first panic attack happened at school, and then whenever I was at school, I'd worry about having an attack, and then I'd have one.

I was on various SSRIs until I was 26. I was taking Zoloft at the time, hadn't had a panic attack in like 3 years, and my doctor agreed that I could try to taper off. It was HELL. Like, my panic attacks came back full-force, I felt suicidal, I could barely eat, I had ""brain zaps""... etc. The withdrawal lasted fooooorever and was much worse than I expected. After several months of that, I said fuck it, started taking a low dose of Prozac (10mg, I think) and I felt better.

A year after that, I got pregnant with Oliver. I was feeling good, and I didn't want to take an SSRI if I didn't have to, so with my doctor's blessing I tapered off when I got my positive HPT and completely quit at 6 weeks. Since I was newly pregnant, it's hard to say what symptoms were SSRI withdrawal and which were from being pregnant - but I was CRAZY emotional, depressed, and had extreme nausea for about 3 months after quitting. Like, I honestly didn't get out of bed some days and I sobbed daily.

Anyway, as you all know, in my late second trimester we discovered Oliver had a urinary tract blockage that caused his kidneys to quit working completely. Basically, when I was between 6-8 weeks pregnant, his urinary system did not develop properly, so he couldn't pee out the amniotic fluid he drank, which caused urine to back up and ruin the whole system. I asked the doctors if Prozac could have been the cause for his birth defect - since I quit at 6 weeks and the drug was still in my system when all this important organ creation (that got fucked up) was happening. They all said no, probably not, there aren't any studies linking SSRIs to this - but we can't tell you for certain... there are limited studies on SSRI use during pregnancy, and this specific birth defect is very rare.

Obviously I was really, really depressed after we lost Oliver, and my doctor suggested going back on an SSRI. But I knew I wanted to TTC right away, and even though the chances were that Prozac had nothing to do with Oliver's birth defect, I couldn't shake the idea that *maybe* it did have something to do with it. So I figured, unless I'm legit suicidal, I'm not going to take an SSRI. 

(trigger below - subsequent pregnancy)

I'm now 15 weeks pregnant again. Even though I am still dealing with the grief of losing Oliver and the anxiety over this new pregnancy, I still think I am in a much better place emotionally than I was at the same point in Oliver's pregnancy. That makes me think that my mood swings, depression, etc. during his pregnancy was not ""normal"" pregnancy stuff, but withdrawal from Prozac. I'm not saying I'm 100% happy, because I'm not, I still struggle.. but it's not ""bad enough"" for me to consider going on medication again. I just don't think I was that different of a person when I was on an SSRI. I might've been slightly less anxious, slightly happier, but not that different. 

All of that said - I am definitely open to going on an SSRI if I develop PPD and it's completely necessary. I know that I have multiple risk factors for PPD. I feel safer being on medication while breastfeeding than I do while pregnant. And, if for some reason, I was to become extremely depressed or suicidal during this pregnancy, I'd consider taking something. But at this point I think I'm ""okay"" enough not to need them.

<p>All of that said - I am definitely open to going on an SSRI if I develop PPD and it&#39;s completely necessary. I know that I have multiple risk factors for PPD. I feel safer being on medication while breastfeeding than I do while pregnant. And, if for some reason, I was to become extremely depressed or suicidal during this pregnancy, I&#39;d consider taking something. But at this point I think I&#39;m &quot;okay&quot; enough not to need them.</p>

Any changes from the last positive that you're trying to make: Im trying not to smoke weed again (please dont judge me) as soon as I learned I was pregnant I have stopped, but lately its been hard not too... Help me disconnect a little

Where do you live: Northern California

How long trying: Almost exactly 1 year.  We started on our wedding night, May 3, 2014 :)

Describe your positives and the results: First positive after 6 months, in November 2014.  MC'ed at 11 weeks, on New Years Day.  Second BFP in March 2015, and MC'ed at 9 weeks just last weekend :(

Any changes from the last positive that you're trying to make: Really would like to lose some weight!  I've gained about 15 pounds since our wedding.  I think in part due to being pregnant for a few months, in part due to the sadness and stress of the losses, and in part just due to laziness and relaxing into married life.  Hoping that eating healthier / more veggies will help our chances next time.  Also switched from a plastic water bottle to glass when I freaked out about BPAs and miscarriage correlation.

Where are you in your cycle today: Still bleeding / spotting from MC.  It's pretty light at this point.  Hoping my cycle will get back on track promptly.

Any diagnoses?: No diagnosis.  I do have long, slightly irregular cycles.  Usually ovulate around CD20-25.

Name 5 random favorite things: my cats, anything gold or leopard print, hot fudge sundaes, 90s alternative music, and whales.

Partly because I just dropped off the face of the earth during a really busy time where I had a lot of obligations, and partly because I needed to know I wasn&#39;t alone and that there were people I knew who understood what I was going through. I knew of two friends who had struggled with recurrent miscarriages and fertility. They have both since conceived and delivered healthy babies.</p>

<p>What I didn&#39;t expect was someone I had gone to high school with. She messaged me privately and poured her heart out to me, though we aren&#39;t and were never close friends. She told me about her struggles to conceive, her roundabouts with medication and treatments and tests, and her loss and that she was there if I needed to talk about it or needed support.</p>

<p>Edit to update: there&#39;s nothing wrong except my vagina is a troll. The nurse practitioner suggested that my ph might be off so I can try baking soda baths or something called Rephresh gel. Got to hear baby&#39;s heartbeat, so that made the whole trip worth it :)</p>

Today was not a great day.  Went to the GP for TDAP (new nephew born on Sunday).
First the nurse congratulated me on being 15 weeks pregnant.  Despite all medical records from the D&C and ultrasound and OB being sent to them and despite speaking to a GP 2 weeks ago re my HCG, no one has updated my file.  The nurse was having trouble trying to change it, so no guarantees it will be done next time.  She was very nice and apologetic and I didn't make a big deal of it as it was not her fault, but she did admit to not reading deeper into the file where it had this information.

Then the Dr who came in to do the cross check that the correct vaccine was being given was clearly 20+ weeks pregnant.

I was told to wait 15 mins to monitor for signs of reaction including swelling throat.  Ummm don't know how I'm going to monitor this as my throat is already swelling from trying not to cry.
The nurse did promise to try and update the summery information on  my file.

And the Australian government announces today that pregnant women and their partners will now be vaccinated for free.  So should have saved myself $50 and pretended yes I was still pregnant.

I have also been having bad dreams/thoughts that the ultrasonographer got it wrong the second time and the heart rate had not stopped.  He was so fast and while I could clearly see the foetal measurement was the same size as the week prior and that there was no doppler blood flow, he seemed like he wanted me out quickly.  That was another case of medical people not reading their notes.  He had been the one to see me 6days prior and when I arrived for the final ultrasound he was alll chirpy and ""so why have you come here to see me today?"" 
""Um because my foetus' heart rate was slow last week and you told me to come in today and confirm it had deceased...""  He apologised for not reading his notes, but was clearly embarrassed and wanted it all over.  So 5 weeks later I am questioning whether he was correct (I know he was) and whether I killed my foetus.

On the upside? I have been so angry and feel like my blood is boiling over, so must be PMSing? CD1 very soon please?

I just want to sleep for days.

Where do you live: Palo Alto, CA. 
  

How long trying: Since we lost our son in November, this is our third cycle. First two were a bust since I had a bunch of submucosal fibroids that weren't going to allow for successful implantation. I'd had the same problem before trying for James as well, but once the fibroid was removed it took us four cycles to conceive.
  

Describe your positives and the results: Got a positive in July 2014, but our baby died at 18 weeks when he was born too early due to  incompetent cervix.
  

Any changes from the last positive that you're trying to make: I've started group therapy. Hopefully it will help me have a less anxious, stressful pregnancy this time round. I've also turned into a crazy pill popper. I have been supplementing with vitamin C, b complex, probiotics, fish oil, evening primrose oil and l-arginine. Is crazy because I take the epo and the l-arg two pills three times a day, and then on to of that I have all other supplements, plus a prenatal, SSRI, low dose aspirin and iron.

  

Where are you in your cycle today: CD1. :(

  
Any diagnoses?: Anxiety and depression, fibroids, incompetent cervix.
  

Name 5 random favorite things: birds, beautiful paper, fruit, tea, chocolate.

  

What are you doing this weekend: going to a burlesque show on Friday night, having a beach picnic on Sunday, Saturday probably relaxing and preparing my Mother's Day surprise for my recipient!

Think of your whole cycle like a chain reaction - or better yet, like a Rube Goldberg machine.  Infertility means that one piece (or maybe a few pieces, who knows) of the machine goes a little wrong and then the whole chain reaction is messed up and the end goal of the machine doesn't happen.  Oral fertility meds set the beginning part of the Rube Goldberg machine on precisely the right course, which allows everything else to run smoothly.  

It generally goes something like this: FSH stimulates your follicles.  Eventually, one of those follicles becomes dominant and estrogen starts pumping up to mature it.  (Estrogen also thickens up your lining.) Once estrogen reaches a certain threshold, LH spikes, which causes that mature follicle to pop and you ovulate.  The cells that line the follicle produce progesterone, which gets your nice, thick lining ready to snuggle up to a fertilized egg and which will help that egg develop into an embryo.  Progesterone peaks around 7DPO, at which point if the egg isn't fertilized production drops off as all the progesterone your follicle made has been released.  Once progesterone drops below a certain point your lining sheds, you get your period, and the process begins again.  

Do you like graphs?! http://en.wikiversity.org/wiki/Reference_ranges_for_estradiol,_progesterone,_luteinizing_hormone_and_follicle-stimulating_hormone_during_the_menstrual_cycle

Imagine all these graphs overlaid with one another and you can see how different hormones dominate during different days of your cycle. 

How does this play into how Clomid and letrozole work?  Well, Clomid works in your brain - that's right!  your brain! - and blocsk receptors that bind with estrogen; as a result, your brain thinks you haven't made enough estrogen even though you have, and you make extra FSH to compensate and go into overdrive making follicles.  When you go off the Clomid, bam, you make even more estrogen, maturing those follicles nicely.  However, (and this is the part I'm always a little unclear on), this feedback pattern tends to not allow your lining to thicken as well.  It can also cause cysts on your ovaries after a while, and since it works in your brain can even result in vision changes.  Hence why the number of times you use it is limited. 

Letrozole, on the other hand, blocks certain other molecules in your body from turning into estrogen and actually lowers estrogen production early in your cycle rather than making your body just think you haven't produced enough.  You get the same effect - added FSH boosting the maturation of thole follicles.  Once you come off letrozole your body pumps up the estrogen production again, which is why I think (warning: not 100% sure here, might be talking out of my ass) your lining doesn't thin as much on letrozole.  

So, different mechanisms of action, same effect at getting the chain reaction of your cycle to happen the right way with the right timing :) ",[],,t1_cqmt2q9,False,0,[],False,"<div class=""md""><p>Exactly.

Age? 30 His age? 30

Where do you live? Indiana 

How long trying: I had a surprise pregnancy in August 2014 that ended in a surprise miscarriage at 10 weeks.  After that, we started trying immediately - five cycles later, we were pregnant again, but for only 8 weeks this time.  I only have 5 cycles actively trying under my belt so far, but the journey started 8 months ago.

Describe your positive results: The first BFP scared the shit out of me for about two days before I finally started to get a little excited. My SO was excited immediately.  The second BFP, we were both overjoyed.  My OB told us that the chances of two consecutive miscarriages were very low, so we allowed ourselves nothing but optimism, although the worry was there from the beginning.

Any changes from the last positive that you're trying to make? I changed my prenatal to a more complete one, added a B complex, CoQ10, Inositol, and baby aspirin.  I'm watching caffeine and other stuff that could be affecting egg quality, and trying to exercise more and lose weight.

Where are you in your cycle today? CD22 after D&C.  I thought I had ovulated but the ovaries said ""nah""

Any diagnosis? PCOS in 1999 but I ovulate/cycle regularly after years of weight management (that's now gone to hell after two pregnancies + 40lbs).  SO has a narrow urethra, but his end seems to be contributing nicely, all things considered.

What are you doing this weekend: work! ugh!  ",[],,t1_cqmohtc,False,0,[],False,"<div class=""md""><p>Reddit Name: Sentient Celery</p>

<p>Any meaning behind that? I mainly liked the alliteration but... there&#39;s that creepy talking celery from Veggie Tales that cracks me up for some reason</p>

<p>Age? 30 His age? 30</p>

<p>Where do you live? Indiana </p>

<p>How long trying: I had a surprise pregnancy in August 2014 that ended in a surprise miscarriage at 10 weeks.  After that, we started trying immediately - five cycles later, we were pregnant again, but for only 8 weeks this time.  I only have 5 cycles actively trying under my belt so far, but the journey started 8 months ago.</p>

<p>Describe your positive results: The first BFP scared the shit out of me for about two days before I finally started to get a little excited. My SO was excited immediately.  The second BFP, we were both overjoyed.  My OB told us that the chances of two consecutive miscarriages were very low, so we allowed ourselves nothing but optimism, although the worry was there from the beginning.</p>

<p>Any changes from the last positive that you&#39;re trying to make? I changed my prenatal to a more complete one, added a B complex, CoQ10, Inositol, and baby aspirin.  I&#39;m watching caffeine and other stuff that could be affecting egg quality, and trying to exercise more and lose weight.</p>

<p>Where are you in your cycle today? CD22 after D&amp;C.  I thought I had ovulated but the ovaries said &quot;nah&quot;</p>

I'm going to recommend one big thing if you're going on letrozole - ask your doctor if she is comfortable monitoring you while you're on it via ultrasound and/or bloodwork.  You are *very* right for thinking you should have asked about that.  A *lot* of OBs prescribe first-line fertility drugs like clomid and letrozole and then don't monitor patients while they're on them.  You will want baseline bloodwork after your period and an  ultrasound - this is to make absolutely sure that you are not pregnant and that there are no cysts or uterine issues that could be aggravated by the medicine.  Additionally, without monitoring you can't be sure that the drugs helped you ovulate!  

There are internet horror stories everywhere of women on these drugs, specifically Clomid, who wound up worse off than they were before their OB prescribed the meds because no one was watching what they were doing to their bodies.  So...a heads-up.  If your doc doesn't feel qualified to monitor you, I might ask for a referral to an RE to have them do that.  

To answer your other questions - Clomid and letrozole, through two different mechanisms of action, suppress your body's ability to either make or know that you're making estrogen, and as a result your body ramps up production of estrogen and/or FSH because it think you're not making enough hormones to mature an egg.  The result is that the egg that winds up in your dominant follicle will mature better and at a more appropriate rate under the influence of stronger hormones.  As to your question about your lining, sometimes ovulation-inducing drugs can help, especially if you wind up making more estrogen; that's the hormone that builds up your lining.  I got pregnant when my lining at 14DPO was just over 7mm, so although 8mm is maybe ""ideal,"" a little less is possible.  If it's a concern, sometimes docs will prescribe a little boost of estrogen a few days before you ovulate to build it up a bit.  Additionally, progesterone after you ovulate can make a so-so lining nice and cushy for implantation - that's what helped me last year.  

There is a general thought that you can only do 6 cycles of Clomid in a lifetime, because Clomid has the side effect of thinning your uterine lining with time.  There is no limit to letrozole that I'm aware of, but since under perfect conditions you have about a 20%-30% chance of getting pregnant every month, after 5 or 6 months, well...a change of game plan will make sense from a mathematical standpoint.

Describe your positives and the results: First positive was weird, I thought I had a period, thought nothing of it , took an OPT and it was super positive (like more so than ever before) so I thought, why the heck not and took a HPT and it was positive. Shocked was an understatement. Lost the heartbeat at around 8 weeks (Dec 23rd Dr could not find heartbeat on regular ultrasound but had to wait until Dec 27th for confirmation with a better ultrasound, that christmas sucked).

Again I had what I thought was a period before and thought nothing of it, took the test and very light positive. Started bleeding two days after that so never really got excited for it, the Dr suspects ecotopic but doesn't know for sure... That was June 15th and my birthday is June 16th, so crappy birthday!
Any changes from the last positive that you're trying to make: Last positive was just under two years ago so not much really. We stopped trying for quite a while and right now are still kind of unsure about trying again.

* Where do you live: Charlotte, NC
* How long trying: Coming up on 1 year anniversary :(
* Describe your positives and the results: Got our BFP Monday before Christmas and was ecstatic!  Usual first trimester nonsense until around 9 weeks.  Thought I was just coming out of morning sickness early. Had some spotting off and on but was told by the midwife that was to be expected since I had a subchorionic hematoma. Found out nearly 3 weeks later that I had miscarried.  Subsequent D&C. 
* Any changes from the last positive that you're trying to make: On BCP for several cycles to regulate me again and since there was a chance I would be changing jobs.  One more month of BCP then I am to start taking baby aspirin (sweet irony) to thin me out and decrease risk of clotting when we get back on the baby train.
* Where are you in your cycle today: On BCP--getting ready to welcome AF on Monday.
* Any diagnoses?: Bicornate uterus.
* Name 5 random favorite things: dogs, junk food, reality tv, shopping, warm weather
* What are you doing this weekend: Driving to Georgia with DH to pick up our new puppy!! :)

Any meaning behind that?: Just a nickname my friend gave me in high school. No one except my brother uses it anymore but it's my online username of choice.

Age and spouse's age: We're both 28.

Where do you live: Northern Alberta, Canada. Brrrrrr! 

How long trying: About 8 months so far. 

Describe your positives and the results: BFP at the beginning of March. I was so happy and excited and had NO thought that it wouldn't go well. To make a long story short, I miscarried earlier this week. 

Any changes from the last positive that you're trying to make: Not really. I know I'm going to be a lot more cautious with my excitement. 

Where are you in your cycle today: Still waiting for HCG to leave my system so I can start a new cycle. 

Any diagnoses?: A doctor suggested a few years ago that I might have PCOS because I have 50 day cycles, but another dr since then says I don't have it... and I have no other typical PCOS symptoms, so who knows... 

Name 5 random favorite things: Mountains, hiking, skiing, the ocean, board games! 

What are you doing this weekend: Taking it easy Saturday and trying to ease back into normal life. Sunday helping a friend prep their house for selling.

How long trying: It will be a year in May

Describe your positives and the results: I had a positive at the end of January, I was super shocked. Unfortunately I miscarried at 7 weeks, two days after my birthday. I ended up getting a D&C because I thought it would be too hard to wait for my body to do it on its own.

Any changes from the last positive that you're trying to make: Not really. We're actually taking a few months off because we're getting married in June. SO kind of dropped the ball on this though and went for it anyways.

Any diagnoses?: Endo stage III when I was 16, also had my right ovary removed at that time. Last surgery was 2 years ago and endo was between stages I and II, just located in places that caused severe pain.

Age and spouse's age: We are both 33. I'm a few months older than my husband

Where do you live: on the border of Iowa and Illinois.

How long trying: We've been trying with OPKs and temping since my first cycle off of BC back in November, 2013.

Describe your positives and the results: Our first positive was in October 2014- the last natural cycle before we did a Clomid/IUI.  It was a total shock- our ""miracle"". We saw the strong heartbeat at 7 weeks but it measured a bit behind. By the 8 week ultrasound, it was gone. 24 hours after that last ultrasound, I MC'ed on my own. Our miracle was too good to be true.

Any changes from the last positive that you're trying to make: We tried naturally(per my husband's request) after the MC. We're now at almost six months since the MC, so we are doing a Clomid/IUI this next cycle.

Where are you in your cycle today: CD30... which is super strange for me. my cycles are ALWAYS 28 days.  My tests I keep taking are so, so negative. My body's just f*cking with me.

Any diagnoses?:Stage III Endo when I had my lap back in 2002- probably worse than that now. Also mild MFI.

I am a wreck though. Husband is in AFIB. I stay awake all night and just sob hysterically, and go check on him every half hour expecting him to be dead. Every kiss goodbye or goodnight I expect to be the last one so I have tears streaming down my face. I'm shopping for a home defibrillator  (they're a thing now), and carry around the aspirin and have a bag ready for if I call 911. 

I'm too terrified to have sex with him now.

[Triggers- some honest stuff ]

I'm trying to not make him stressed as that is bad but I feel exactly how it was when I held my son as he died, just ""No no no it is coming I cant stop it no"". My husband almost took me to the hospital last night as I was so distraught I was inconsolable and begging him to let me die so I didn't have to experience his death. Luckily I am prescribed Ativan and that stopped the hysteria. Just man...this is rough.

I'm not doing well ladies. I keep listening to his heartbeat when he sleeps and it sounds so crazy, no rhythm, just chaotic mess of sounds. I keep expecting it to stop as I listen to it. I haven't done my hair in days and went yesterday to wander the hospital that caused Kieran's death. Everyone who is supposed to be getting me answers went home at 4, doors locked and lights off. It must be nice to just forget and go home for supper and tv while I am left just waiting and wandering in agony. One guy went on vacation. How about he pays for ME to go on a vacation. His hospital and his staff killed my baby, but yeah, just go on vacation, no worries, lalala.

I called my nurse from the hospital cafeteria for support, and she is so awesome, she laughed with me about crazy lady jokes and said if it helps me then just wander the hospital. She gets how it makes me feel like I have some sort of power in this place and a presence. I can't go near the ER yet, but that's for the best probably. 

I want to go into the ER to see if I can find this nurse who knew my baby was going to die and didn't say anything (who I have the name of), but not to talk to her, just to see what her face looks like so I can have a picture of who to forgive. But I can't do that, I get it's pretty stalkery and could affect our lawsuit. I don't hate her, I just want to ask her what happened. 

So I'm just sitting at home not wanting to do anything. I slept till 3pm because I didn't want to be awake anymore. 

Last night I played with the cats for 3 hours straight. Just laid on the carpet and stared at the ceiling while they pounced on me and brought me toys. It was actually kind of calming. 

Oh and my mom (not bio, just *my mom*), who has MS, in a wheelchair, and a failing heart valve, called and said they think she has colon cancer. She's been bleeding and they found a polyp. She goes for more investigative surgeries tomorrow. She lives in the US and I want to go to her right now but I can't leave my husband. 

Anyway, sorry to vent all that. 

Here's hoping my test in 6 days will be a BFP. 

**Update:** Thanks everyone <3 We decided to just go shopping and stay out of the house all evening. I got him anything he saw and smiled at. $100 shirt? Fuck it, ring it up. I'll be a stripper later if it means he is happy now. Anything to make him feel better. Sad that material things do make us feel better, I know. Just it's a distraction and I tried to make it fun for him as he never gets himself nice things. Then I bought him dinner at the pub, found his friends and they watched the game together. 

He's in bed now and they gave him new pills to prevent stroke so I feel a bit better tonight. Didn't melt down. Lots of kisses but no tears. 

Thanks for all the kind words. ",[],,t1_cql7d8g,,0,,False,"<div class=""md""><p>4DPO and temps are staying up, slow climb, so a good sign. </p>

<p>I am a wreck though. Husband is in AFIB. I stay awake all night and just sob hysterically, and go check on him every half hour expecting him to be dead. Every kiss goodbye or goodnight I expect to be the last one so I have tears streaming down my face. I&#39;m shopping for a home defibrillator  (they&#39;re a thing now), and carry around the aspirin and have a bag ready for if I call 911. </p>

<p>I&#39;m too terrified to have sex with him now.</p>

<p>[Triggers- some honest stuff ]</p>

<p>I&#39;m trying to not make him stressed as that is bad but I feel exactly how it was when I held my son as he died, just &quot;No no no it is coming I cant stop it no&quot;. My husband almost took me to the hospital last night as I was so distraught I was inconsolable and begging him to let me die so I didn&#39;t have to experience his death. Luckily I am prescribed Ativan and that stopped the hysteria. Just man...this is rough.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not doing well ladies. I keep listening to his heartbeat when he sleeps and it sounds so crazy, no rhythm, just chaotic mess of sounds. I keep expecting it to stop as I listen to it. I haven&#39;t done my hair in days and went yesterday to wander the hospital that caused Kieran&#39;s death. Everyone who is supposed to be getting me answers went home at 4, doors locked and lights off. It must be nice to just forget and go home for supper and tv while I am left just waiting and wandering in agony. One guy went on vacation. How about he pays for ME to go on a vacation. His hospital and his staff killed my baby, but yeah, just go on vacation, no worries, lalala.</p>

<p>I called my nurse from the hospital cafeteria for support, and she is so awesome, she laughed with me about crazy lady jokes and said if it helps me then just wander the hospital. She gets how it makes me feel like I have some sort of power in this place and a presence. I can&#39;t go near the ER yet, but that&#39;s for the best probably. </p>

<p>I want to go into the ER to see if I can find this nurse who knew my baby was going to die and didn&#39;t say anything (who I have the name of), but not to talk to her, just to see what her face looks like so I can have a picture of who to forgive. But I can&#39;t do that, I get it&#39;s pretty stalkery and could affect our lawsuit. I don&#39;t hate her, I just want to ask her what happened. </p>

<p>So I&#39;m just sitting at home not wanting to do anything. I slept till 3pm because I didn&#39;t want to be awake anymore. </p>

<p>Last night I played with the cats for 3 hours straight. Just laid on the carpet and stared at the ceiling while they pounced on me and brought me toys. It was actually kind of calming. </p>

<p>Oh and my mom (not bio, just <em>my mom</em>), who has MS, in a wheelchair, and a failing heart valve, called and said they think she has colon cancer. She&#39;s been bleeding and they found a polyp. She goes for more investigative surgeries tomorrow. She lives in the US and I want to go to her right now but I can&#39;t leave my husband. </p>

<p>Anyway, sorry to vent all that. </p>

<p>Here&#39;s hoping my test in 6 days will be a BFP. </p>

I had a CP right around the same time as you. I started spotting on April 7th, and the 2nd blood test on April 8th confirmed the CP because my HCG had gone down by 1 point instead of doubling.

Another weird thing is that my OPK this morning was practically positive, and I normally don't ovulate until CD20-25, and today is just CD11. Took a HPT for the first time since I found out about the CP, and it was still a faint positive - the same as it'd been when I got my first BFP. Fucking sucks.

I just want to reassure you that what you are feeling right now is a normal reaction to a traumatic event. You are still you, the same wonderful person you have always been, you're just trying to find a way to process an awful pain. Everyone grieves differently, but feeling like you never want to try again, the numbness, the hysteria, the devastation at having to untell people, feeling lost - it's not something that you need to suppress or feel guilty about. Many of us have gone through something similar after losses, and it's OK to let yourself grieve in whatever way helps you to process the shock and the sadness. 

I also want to encourage you to lean on other people in your time of need. Find someone you love and trust and let them do the untelling, this should not be your burden to bear. Don't feel like you should be ashamed, or that you need to quit your job (unless you really want to), because you have done absolutely *nothing* wrong. Be glad that you were able to celebrate the life of your little one with the people you care about while you could. Hopefully these people are now going to become your support network as you try to process your loss - but if you don't want that, that's fine too. Just tell your trusted person to pass around that you are not ready to talk about things and would like business as usual. Most people will respect your need for space in this difficult time.

So have that beer and that nap, and give yourself time to heal. There's no need to make any decisions before you are ready. A quote that often gets posted around here explains that grief is like waves in the ocean. Some days the waves swamp and drown you, other days everything is calm, and over time the big waves get further and further apart. All I can say is that I promise that it does get better. This day is a bad day, but there will be good days to come even if it seems impossible right now. Your losses will always be a part of you, but it becomes more manageable in time. 

Remember that we are always here if you need to talk and that you never need to feel scared or ashamed to post what you are feeling. We care, and we do understand at least some of what you are going through. Sending love and support, and once again I am so sorry for your losses.

Edit: I also just want to emphasise that *you were pregnant*.

My ClearBlue digital monitor says I ovulated on CD13 and 14 but FF told me 15, which is weird and hasn't happened before.

And both times after I hopped up to shower and freshen up. 

Now, I'm not getting my hopes up, I swear I'm not, but I find it so odd that I'm either 5 or 7 DPO and for the first time I have not spotted yet. Usually I start spotting 3DPO. I have lots of creamy CM. The only thing I'm doing different this month is taking baby aspirin daily. And I feel tugging down by uterus, similar but much more faint to when I was pregnant last month. I know it's early, and implantation hasn't even started yet, or just did, so I can't explain it. And I am usually one of those people that does not read into symptoms because you can always ""think"" yourself pregnant. I just can't imagine, the one month we don't try, I don't lay in bed with legs propped up, I don't plan it, we don't do it 10 days in a row, can you effing imagine?

 He died from bacterial meningitis caused by E.coli. In easier-to-understand terms; when he was born, E.coli (on everything, it's normally fine) got into his blood. It sits and causes a few symptoms but in the case of E.coli they are normal new-baby symptoms. The hospital forgot to tell us that they knew he had E.coli from a blood test. He needed antibiotics but because he didn't get them, the bacteria got into his brain and then exploded in growth, causing sepsis and destroying the brain very quickly (within hours). As a result he was incompatible with life and we chose - after an extensive MRI to make sure he could not somehow recover even if partially - to remove life support and to hold him while he died. We sang him songs and talked to him. I got to give him a bath after.  It took a long time for that to happen as the primitive parts try to keep him alive, and so eventually he did pass in his Dad's arms just as I had gone to a hospital bed to nap for shifts, as we didn't know if it would take days or longer. 

So yeah, I get a bit sensitive to anyone suggesting I didn't do enough or that he wanted to leave me or that his death was a good thing. My sister told me the day he was dying that she hoped I didn't choose to let him go as she would still love him anyway.

There are some theories about miscarriage and males i.e. women may be more likely to miscarry a male fetus but they are just <strong>theories</strong>. I have mostly heard this as a theory for why some women miscarry frequently but have live births as well. Both of my parents come from families of almost all girls and from the perspective of evolution it makes sense but I have yet to see any scientific back up.</p>

He&#39;s had them shock his heart dozens of times before and it has been six years since the last AFIB. </p>

<p>I am feeling pretty scared. I know that the whole trauma of losing Kieran, the legal issues after and him dealing with my mental problems plus our grief has probably caused this. If something happens to him...well I won&#39;t think about that today. </p>

<p>He&#39;s the healthiest guy too. Ex body builder, eats organic and nothing with additives, vitamins every day, in great shape. So it&#39;s not fair..</p>

<p>But, after he told me, I realized I am 100% done being wishy washy about wanting to be pregnant again (emotionally I mean). This cycle is bad timing (due date would match up with Kieran&#39;s death), but screw it. Time to get busy.</p>

So the RE thinks it's not going to grow much more, and she's worried that if we keep waiting the egg will get too old.  

Protocol now is to keep testing with ovulation tests today and tomorrow, and if I haven't surged yet, trigger tomorrow night and IUI Saturday morning.  If I do manage to surge today or tomorrow, then to trigger right away and come in the next morning for an IUI.  My money's on the not-surging-IUI-Saturday scenario.

Other than that, we also had a regular check-in with our RE, and talked about the overall plan.  She thinks we have about a 30% chance this cycle with the IUI and the follicle that I do have.  Next cycle, she wants to up my dose of Femara from 5 to 7.5 so hopefully we get consistently two good follicles.  Then if that doesn't work, the third IUI cycle will be Femara 7.5 plus some injectable FSH.  With that whole plan, she estimates a 60-70% chance that we will get pregnant in those three cycles.  If we don't, she said the odds drop pretty dramatically.

If after 3 IUIs we're not pregnant, she said there's typically some other underlying issue that can't be identified.  She said we could go on to do 3 more with injectables-only, but that at that point we only have a 10-12% chance of any of those working.  And then if nothing, we have to decide if we want to do IVF.

So basically I'm really scared and sobbing a lot this morning.  Why couldn't my follicles have grown better over the past two days so at least we have better odds this cycle?  Why is this all so fucking hard for us?  And the big one, I'm just so scared that we won't get pregnant in the next 3 cycles.

My husband got snappy with me this morning because I haven't followed up with the insurance company yet about the Rhogam shot they denied coverage for when I was miscarrying.

So I guess it makes sense that he's not there for this either. It just sucks that I have to keep dealing with this every damn day and it's mostly by myself even though it was half his baby.
