I was actually feeling really good! Then yesterday I had light brown discharge. Today I'm spotting brown. 

&#x200B;

This is month 4 of brown spotting a week before my period, and month 6 of TTC. So I called my OB's office and they got me in today. 

&#x200B;

I love my OB, and she's just as confused as I am - why did I have two textbook-perfect periods right on time after a full-term delivery followed by this nonsense? We decided on testing progesterone, prolactin, and thyroid levels. After I left the office she gave me a call after consulting with some colleagues specializing in infertility and ordered more tests (I'm an idiot, I didn't save the message...) as well as a transvaginal ultrasound, just in case there is any retained placenta. (I had a velementious insertion as well as a placental abruption, and my placenta came out in pieces, but I wouldn't stop hemorrhaging until TWO OB's got it all out, so I'm really hoping it isn't this...) To make things even more exciting, I'm going to be in Florida when I will likely need the progesterone test, so Monday I need to call the lab chain my hospital uses and see if their Florida locations can take an order from my OB. (Also it means I'll spend a day of my vacation ubering to get blood drawn, but whatever.)

Me: I am about 3 and a half weeks post a D&C for my third loss in a row. This one was at 13 weeks—the other two losses, both in 2018, were under 6 weeks. I just had to rant as I’m getting my period now and it is so very heavy I can’t even. Like, I’ve been bleeding through my jeans and through PJ bottoms for two days now and while I am not depressed about the miscarriage to the point that this is triggering, it has at the least become very old, very fast. 

No specific advice wanted but I’m going for RPL first appointment on Monday at a fertility clinic and all good vibes are welcomed. I’m soon to be 39....have one LC, aged 7, from a previous (not that it matters, but abusive), marriage, and want to have a second child with my now husband. 

My husband is an amazing step-dad and just an all-around amazing person and I want this for him almost more than for me, although I want it badly, too. It’s frustrating to me—though I know I’m not alone—that conceiving isn’t the issue at my age but hanging onto the baby is. Having gotten to the second trimester with this last one felt like a dream just got snatched away from me. I was blindsided—it was a MMC discovered at the 13 week nuchal scan, when I was on paper about exactly 13 weeks, and baby measured “about 12”. I had all my symptoms daily....it was just very hard to come to terms with at first.

I asked for genetic testing on this recent loss—I have hope that they’ll have the results back on Monday because waiting for that has been hard. I felt so strongly that that baby was a girl, and I’m anxious to confirm that if possible too.

I fell pregnant in January 2018 only to suffer a missed miscarriage at the 9 week mark. I had a D&C in March 2018 and then on the second post-D&C cycle got pregnant again only for the same thing to happen: missed miscarriage followed by a D&C around 8 weeks in July 2018.

&#x200B;

I want to find a set of dainty stackable birthstone rings to honor my children, both living and dead (I like the idea of wearing all of their birth stones together, to symbolize that my loss baby was just as important as my living ones.) This sort of jewelry is everywhere, all over Etsy and Amazon, but I want ones that are going to be durable over time.

I remember that when we bought wedding rings, my husband got some sort of synthetic metal one that was extremely inexpensive but highly durable. I think it was called Tungsten? It looks silver but it was about $100 rather than $1500 for the same things made of actual silver.

46,2048,confidence,<praw.reddit.Reddit object at 0x7f12a630cd90>,,ttcafterloss,"Hi all, joining you today after finding out I’m having a CP. I got a squinter last week and my beta was 9 at 12 dpo. At 15 dpo, it was 33. I was testing all weekend and the lines weren’t darkening, so I knew it was going to be bad news today. My beta results this morning was 7. Even though I was only pregnant for a week, I was surprised how hard the loss it me. I cried about it and said goodbye last night because I knew I’d get the news today at work.   

I was diagnosed with PCOS as a teen, so I always knew getting pregnant would be a struggle. After months of seeing if/when I’d ovulate, this was our first medicated cycle. I didn’t respond at all to the first dose of letrozole so they increased it in the same cycle. I was also really sick with the flu at the beginning of this cycle so everything just felt *off*. I wish there was a better way of describing it, but nothing felt right with me or the timing the whole month.

I cried about it and said goodbye last night because I knew I’d get the news today at work.   </p>

<p>I was diagnosed with PCOS as a teen, so I always knew getting pregnant would be a struggle. After months of seeing if/when I’d ovulate, this was our first medicated cycle. I didn’t respond at all to the first dose of letrozole so they increased it in the same cycle. I was also really sick with the flu at the beginning of this cycle so everything just felt <em>off</em>. I wish there was a better way of describing it, but nothing felt right with me or the timing the whole month.    </p>

On January 16th, I tested with a FRER and got a positive result (albeit quite faint). January 18th, I started what I figured was my period. Moderate to heavy bleeding (a bit heavier than normal for me), minimal cramps, no clots. It lasted until the 22nd, at which point I tested with a wondfo and got a negative within the timeframe. This was the first negative HPT I’d gotten since the D&C. A few hours later, there was a very faint pinkish line on it, though I’m aware that it’s an invalid result due to the time passed.

6 days ago (January 29th) I began to bleed VERY heavily and passed a clot approximately 2.5-3 inches across. The bleeding stopped almost immediately afterward, save for a little bit of brown spotting the next day. I haven’t had any cramping or pain, either.

I’ve been testing very faintly positive on HPTs ever since. My tests (wondfos) have been roughly the same darkness for the past 6 days. They’re not darkening, and not lightening. I had one FRER left that I took a few days ago, and the test line was approximately the same darkness as the one that I took on January 16th, two days before my “period.” I haven’t had any betas drawn since the d&c, and when I called the nurse I was told that I should only come in if I’m still getting positive tests/no period by 8 weeks.

I don’t think it’s even possible that this could be a new pregnancy. We had unprotected sex at 2 weeks post-d&c, but other than that we’ve used condoms. If I DID get pregnant from that one time, 6 weeks ago, I’d assume that my tests wouldn’t be these terrible little squinters by now. None of this makes sense. I thought that my period would only come back once hcg went below 5, so maybe my bleeding from the 18th-22nd wasn’t even a period. Maybe the negative test I had was a false result.

Fuck. I am so fucking done already. I want this to be over. I want my body back to normal. I am so angry and frustrated and I can’t do a goddamn thing until my husband comes home later this week. I will be going to the hospital as soon as he’s home.

So, backstory, I have PCOS and I am 32 no LC. Husband and I had agreed to start trying last year around this time when doctor said if you want one now is the time to start. Since i have PCOS, we knew that we would need help with ovulation. Started seeing OB/GYN that is known for helping women get pregnant quickly. He made me start metformin in Feb. Last year and up the dose gradually. Well it was already the end of June by the time we actually did the first dose of clomid, which resulted in no ovulation. End of July, upped clomid, again no ovulation. End of August, upped clomid, finally ovulated and got BFP end of September. 
Two weeks after BFP started spotting, ended with a DnC at 8 weeks and MTX shot because it was ectopic. No surgery to remove tube, which I am thankful for. Took 9 weeks to get HcG to zero. BC for one month to get through MTX wait time. HSG done end of Dec. That showed tubes were open. OB/GYN refers to RE because he says I meed more monitoring.(he did this even before hsg, he was leaving practice at the end of the year, which makes me wonder if that is why he referred me?)

Now to this week, had my appointment with RE and they want to test husbands sperm, do another ultrasound with saline to see my uterus because HSG didnt show it clearly, and charge me $1000 a month to do timed intercourse with clomid(drugs not included in cost) right off the bat. Insurance will cover testing and that is it. Hubby and I are both teachers, which means that cost will be a huge burden, amd I know kids cost money, but shit man, $1000 a month is a lot of money with no guarentee that I will actually get pregnant and be able to carry to full term.

Now here is my issue, we were really only trying for 3 months, were successfully pregnant after the first month I actually ovulated, even though it was ectopic. I dont think I need that much monitoring yet!

I have made three different appointments for the next two weeks, with the only other offices and a new OB/GYN at the same office to get second opinions and see if any of them will give me 3 more months of meds with at home monitoring of LH to see if I can get pregnant again, before sending me to the RE. 

Old doc would only prescribe clomid, and I asked repeatedly for Letrozole due to PCOS studies saying it is better. And he didnt do progesterone because that is how he was testing to see if I ovulated. These are the things I want to try before going to an RE.

Here is the question, am I fighting a losing battle,  should I just give up and work with the RE, or am I right to try the less involved route first, if I can get one of the docs I am seeing on board?

I feel like I am going crazy about this crap, and I just want to have a freaking baby! I am making changes in my life to be as healthy as possible for this next pregnancy. I feel like we got so close and now its unattainable.

I know I’m fortunate my state has mandates to cover IVF, and my husband has a good job with excellent insurance that doesn’t even require preauthorization for ivf coverage, and that we have the money to pay for the out of pocket cost of the testing (which isn’t cheap).. but I’m still left feeling torn about it all. 

I walked into my TTC journey with these ideas of no intervention, one ultrasound and a home birth.. and now I’m like BRING ON THE SCIENCE. Better living through medicine, I guess. Am I selfish for not trying again naturally? Am I playing god with this? It’s consuming my thoughts. 

Before they will send all the meds to the pharmacy, they required us to pay for the testing so I’ve put the down payment on my pregnancy all ready. It’s just the weirdest feeling, like I’m scheduling my pregnancy. I’m putting a down payment on a baby. I’ll know the gender, like we will pick the embryo before we have it implanted. 

It’s just hard to wrap my head around. I don’t want any more sadness, so this is my way of having control, but it’s such a shift in mindset. It’s not a guarantee, but with the testing, the likelihood of a pregnancy jumps from something like 30% to 70% more likely to be successful. Like in a few months I could actually be growing a viable baby, I’m so excited but so so scared. And it’s not a guarantee, we could continue to have bad luck, and it’s so hard not to think of at this point.

Wednesday 1/30 I went in for a normal ultrasound, should have been 10.5 weeks for this. 

So I get there and they do a t/v ultrasound, and my ultrasound tech tells me after ten long minutes of silence that there’s 3 babies measuring 6.5-7 weeks and no heartbeats in any. We had an abdominal ultrasound 1/03 and there was just one baby measuring around 6.5 weeks they thought, but for some reason they didn’t do t/v as this was a stand alone clinic just for confirming the pregnancy. It just looked like a black circle back then. 

So at this point I’m shocked and heartbroken. My midwife reviews these ultrasound pictures and says the next day at my follow up that there’s no chance, and that I can always try again. I get sent to an OB next door to start the miscarriage process since I’ve had no symptoms or bleeding. 

I get to my OB appointment today, and she says based on the ultrasound pictures she’s received, she has no proof I’m miscarrying at all. She said it’s extremely hard to diagnose triplets unless you’re an MFM and that she doesn’t even believe it’s triplets. She said 50% of the time this happens with her patients and there’s a healthy baby on the next ultrasound. Very bold statement to say to someone who spent all of yesterday uncontrollably crying and mourning. 

Now my head is spinning. She’s sending me to get a high risk ultrasound with an MFM next Wednesday and thinks I still “have a healthy baby” in her words. But there’s no way I would only be 6.5-7 weeks pregnant. I had a positive pregnancy test December 15th, and to have a 7 week old fetus I would’ve conceived after Christmas. The OB knows these dates as well. 

Has anyone had anything like this happen? Am I crazy for maybe believing her? Is there a chance it’s twins/triplets and they’re just measuring a week or two behind and because it was multiples my pregnancy test was positive faster? Am I grasping at straws here? I refuse to get my hopes up but it’s impossible not to wonder.

74,2048,confidence,<praw.reddit.Reddit object at 0x7f12a630cd90>,,ttcafterloss,"Hi all,

I'm so sorry we're all on this sub :(

Just want to quickly tell my story: after 1 year and 3 months of trying I finally got pregnant end of October. I found out mid-November and we were so happy but I unfortunately had a miscarriage at 8 weeks mid-December. I was terrified of miscarrying but had an ultrasound with a good heartbeat at 7 weeks so I felt more ease. But about a week later I ended up at the emergency room with intense bleeding and cramping. Had another ultrasound there which still showed a heartbeat, but slower than the Dr. wanted it. I was told to stay calm and wait/hope for the best  (50/50 odds) but ultimately miscarried 2 days later. It was a horrific and traumatic experience (especially the pain from the 'contractions' and seeing the fully intact embryo) and I am absolutely not 'over it' as most people seem to expect from me. Especially as it had taken us quite a while to conceive. It is still absolutely heartbreaking.

&#x200B;

This brings us to today, 6 weeks after my miscarriage. A week after my MC I had an ultrasound and the dr saw some leftover tissue (even though I passed the embryo fully intact). I was given misprostol (cytotec) pills. I used the pills (vaginally) the day before Christmas and passed more tissue and blood (though not heavily).

I had a 'period' 2 weeks ago. According to my cycle tracking app (I'm back to using Clue) I'm supposed to ovulate on Monday. (I had an ultrasound this week which showed my uterus was clear).  I used the Clearblue Digital Advanced Ovulation tests before (they really helped me in finally getting pregnant so I am definitely using them from now on) and they are indicating low fertility (empty circle) even though I'm really supposed to be getting high fertility (not yet peak) right now.

So my cycle seems to be off. I know it's 'normal' for your cycles to be off after a miscarriage, but I'm really panicking. I am constantly on edge, stressed out like crazy. I feel like time is ticking (I was going to be just shy of 32 by the time this baby was born) and am desperate to get everything back on track so we can start trying again (although I'm dreading the whole process and the waiting, because really TRYING is NO FUN no matter what people claim. They have NO idea :-/).

Hi everyone. I lost my first pregnancy at 6 weeks last week. I had a complete natural miscarriage, so no d&c. I’m heartbroken, but trying to look forward. 

We are planning to eventually TTC again. I’m not ready yet, but I know I will be in the next few months. We’d like to conceive this year for sure. 

So, my question is, when should I start charting (temping, OPK’s, CM)? Should I wait for my first cycle to begin, or should I temp now so I can know when I ovulate? I don’t think if I ovulate in 2-4 weeks that I’ll be ready to conceive, but I’d like to know if it happen so that I don’t accidentally get pregnant. 

What is your experience with charting after a miscarriage? Is it worth it to start now or should I just wait for my first period and then start? I don’t know what to do. This might be a stupid question but I’m in uncharted waters.

I'm coping, and not in any danger atm. didnt want to worry anyone unecessary but dont wanna delete this in case it help someone else**

When I was 15 I got pregnant as a result of abuse. I told no one, and even though I wanted a baby badly, I decided to terminate.

At 18, I got pregnant again. I was young and broke but desperately in love, so I kept the baby.

She lived for 3 days. She was pretty sick, and I'd been given the choice whether to keep trying desperate measures, or to let her go in peace. I was selfish and tried to hold on even though she was in pain.

When she died I completely lost my mind for a long time. I almost didn't ever come out of it.

That's been well over a decade, and I swear, I thought I was fine. I've had multiple relatives and friends go through losses and been okay helping them through it.

I've had a baby since then... and he's in grade school now and perfectly healthy.

And I've had 2 miscarriages, which was hell... but I got thru it just fine.

I thought I was fine.

But the other night I was on reddit, being an idiot posting advice to people with ridiculous problems... and I saw a post that wasn't ridiculous. Someone faced with the decision to terminate a tri-13 pregnancy or not.

I wanted to help and started to reply and i don't even know what i wrote. A couple lines in i was sobbing uncontrollably and rambling.

I'm trying to just be okay and act like nothing is happening. I don't want to scare my friends or my kid.

But I am so damned devastated right now and I don't know why it hurt so much when it hasnt for so long. I feel like instead of helping I might have made it worse for this woman but im scared to find the post again to check or to delete it.

Every time I can duck out of the room to be alone im crying and crying and i dont want to fall into a dark place again

I&#39;m coping, and not in any danger atm. didnt want to worry anyone unecessary but dont wanna delete this in case it help someone else</strong></p>

<p>When I was 15 I got pregnant as a result of abuse. I told no one, and even though I wanted a baby badly, I decided to terminate.</p>

<p>At 18, I got pregnant again. I was young and broke but desperately in love, so I kept the baby.</p>

<p>She lived for 3 days. She was pretty sick, and I&#39;d been given the choice whether to keep trying desperate measures, or to let her go in peace. I was selfish and tried to hold on even though she was in pain.</p>

<p>When she died I completely lost my mind for a long time. I almost didn&#39;t ever come out of it.</p>

<p>That&#39;s been well over a decade, and I swear, I thought I was fine. I&#39;ve had multiple relatives and friends go through losses and been okay helping them through it.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve had a baby since then... and he&#39;s in grade school now and perfectly healthy.</p>

<p>And I&#39;ve had 2 miscarriages, which was hell... but I got thru it just fine.</p>

<p>I thought I was fine.</p>

<p>But the other night I was on reddit, being an idiot posting advice to people with ridiculous problems... and I saw a post that wasn&#39;t ridiculous. Someone faced with the decision to terminate a tri-13 pregnancy or not.</p>

<p>I wanted to help and started to reply and i don&#39;t even know what i wrote. A couple lines in i was sobbing uncontrollably and rambling.</p>

<p>I&#39;m trying to just be okay and act like nothing is happening. I don&#39;t want to scare my friends or my kid.</p>

<p>But I am so damned devastated right now and I don&#39;t know why it hurt so much when it hasnt for so long. I feel like instead of helping I might have made it worse for this woman but im scared to find the post again to check or to delete it.</p>

<p>Every time I can duck out of the room to be alone im crying and crying and i dont want to fall into a dark place again</p>

<p>idk why im posting here... figured ya&#39;ll might understand more than most, maybe?</p>

<p>im sorry </p>

&#x200B;

It's been 3 years this month since my brief experience with pregnancy -- a CP. My spouse and I have been TTC on and off since, with more serious efforts the past several months.

My mom passed away last month. She had been very ill and suffered a lot this past year, but it was unexpected all the same. We had a complicated and painful relationship. I'm glad she's not suffering anymore, but still, I just miss her. Even with the bad times, I wish she were here. And it's hard waking up each day remembering that she's gone.

TTC-wise, it's so complicated today, and I just need to wait it out, I think. I'm past the two-week wait, and I'm only getting BFNs, but my period hasn't started yet. I have slight spotting, but nothing staining. My period has been like that for a number of years since the CP -- a little spotting a day or two before my period starts -- but it's frustrating to have it so late with this occasional spotting and BFNs the past four days. I have period-like pains, and my mood is very low like it usually is before my period, but that makes sense while I'm grieving, too. The uncertainty is frustrating. I keep holding onto a shred of hope, but even if I were to be pregnant, it would still be a complicated blessing while I'm grieving my mom.

It's hard, too, trying to figure out what it means that my mom isn't here, and that I can't talk to her about any of this. I never told her about the CP -- she only ever knew that my spouse and I wanted to have kids ""someday"" and we left it at that -- but there's so much I wish I could talk to her about. And part of me wishes I talked to her about some of this when she had been well even two years ago. But I'm also glad she didn't know in some ways; I remember as a child that she really suffered whenever I suffered, and since I still don't know if I can have children even, maybe I wouldn't have wanted her to know after all if she would never get the chance to know, either. It's a lot of what-ifs for me.

Anyway, thanks for listening to my rambling, folks. :) I know we're all coping with our suffering and our pain as best we can. :) Best wishes for healing for you all, too. <3

I thought I was pregnant for two weeks. I was beyond excited. We had been trying and I got pregnant on my 3rd cycle after having 3 IUDs for a total of 11 years. I began to get worried when i wasnt having any symptoms of pregnancy. I had morning sickness very bad when I had my first child so i just had this feeling something was wrong. I began spotting 4 days before my first apt and it turned into full on period. I called my doctor and she had me go in right away. There was absolutely nothing on the ultra sound. I was so heartbroken. For two weeks I was so excited. I had about 10 different boards on Pintrest going. Was planning out a nursery. My whole mind was consumed by the thought of this new baby. I wouldn't wish a chemcial pregnancy on anyone. 
My midwife told me this happens often and I couldn't have done anything different. It wasnt my fault, she explained. This helped me feel a little better but you still feel so much pain. 

I bleed for 10 days and now I'm done. I'm waiting on my OPK tests in the mail. I ordered 20 pregnancy tests and 50 OPKs. I just got my basal body themoter in the mail as well. My cycle was 37 days long before I got pregnant but I was only able to calculate this based off two periods since I just had my Mirena removed. I have no idea really when I'll be ovulating so ill be testing. 
I'm just wondering how many woman out there were able to get their positive after a CP and how quickly? I'm 30 years old and just now found the man I'm meant to be with and we want to start our family asap. I want nothing more than to be pregnant again.

I got 3 positive tests in December. Then started bleeding. I called my OB and got stat bloodwork done. The result was 2. My baseline is less than 1 so I HAD been pregnant but it was gone. The next day, the tests were negative. 

I fell into a depression after this CP. I had to have my antidepressant increased to be able to pull myself out of it. Right about the same time, I was 8dpo in my second cycle. I had ovulated late due to the CP.  I got a positive Wondfo. Rather than calling my OB, I went to an outpatient lab that doesn’t require a doctors order for a quant hcg. I got the results the next day, after another positive Wondfo. It was less than 1. What the hell. I decided no more cheapies and bought 2 boxes of FRER.  But I figured, I’m not out yet, it’s early. 

12dpo, I take an FRER. And there’s a second line! But when I wiped, there was pink on the toilet paper. In disbelief, I take another when I have to go pee again. The line is darker, but now the toilet paper is red. I call my OB, asking for bloodwork and telling them I got a positive but am spotting red. That’s at 8:30am. They don’t get back to me until 1pm, by which time I am bleeding like a period. I go in for bloodwork at 2 (which i still haven’t gotten back) but my OB says what I already knew - this sounds like a chemical pregnancy. 

The next morning, I take another FRER although Im bleeding like a moderate period. As I suspected, it’s negative. Stark white. 

So now we’re at 2 CPs in a row. 4/5 pregnancies have ended in loss. I don’t have a problem GETTING pregnant, it’s the staying pregnant that’s the issue. I want to ask my OB for a referral to an RE for a RPL panel but a) my first 2 losses were with a different OB and b) I’m not sure they even count CPs as losses for that purpose. 

I want a second so badly. I know people try a lot longer so this may sound whiny, but I don’t know how many more losses I can handle. The CPs don’t hurt as badly as the MMC, but they still hurt. 

UPDATE: My OB agreed that seeing a RE would be “prudent”. I have an appointment on April 1 which was the first available. I’m really torn on whether to try again before then.

7 months ago had a missed miscarriage. Started TTC this month AF showed up this week. Feeling frustrated....

Went to a work conference today. First thing I get asked ‘do you have kids?’ On my way home from work I see 5 PREGNANT WOMEN. 

My MIL bought my husband and I a cot and baby change table when I was pregnant. I told hubby today I had a bad day it seems like everywhere I go I am reminded of our loss. I told him the baby stuff needs to go. He started getting annoyed saying it would be rude to get rid of it and I need to stop feeling sorry for myself. 

As you can imagine that didn’t go down well. Then he said he can’t keep coming home to a miserable person and I should go get help. He also said he ‘deserves better’. 

I don’t even know what to do. I am trying my best to feel better again but it seems like everyone has kids and I’m the odd one out at 31 and no children. This makes me sad.

111,2048,confidence,<praw.reddit.Reddit object at 0x7f12a630cd90>,,ttcafterloss,"TW -- living child, multiple losses, ectopic pregnancy

I'd been pregnant five times with my late spouse before meeting my now-husband. Those resulted in, in order, a miscarriage, a missed miscarriage, a chemical pregnancy, a living child (woo-hoo!), and another chemical pregnancy. I also had PCOS and was anovulatory. I made sure my husband was aware that it was likely going to be a struggle when we started TTC.

Last year I had a pretty rare type of weight loss surgery. It had an immediate metabolic effect (before any weight loss had even occurred) that gave me regular ovulatory cycles for the first time in my life. But we had to wait for the rapid weight loss to be over before TTC. My uterus, however, had other ideas. It expelled two IUDs in the first nine months after surgery. For several reasons this left us out of contraceptive options. My weight loss had slowed enough to a point I could maintain instead of lose  by making a few simple changes so we decided to hell with it, let's TTC. I felt ovulation pains from both ovaries that cycle and hoped for twins.

I got a faint positive on Christmas that was negative two days later. I thought it was another chemical. I was so upset but I didn't know what was coming. 

Five days after that initial faint positive I was late. And the tests were positive again. I was thrilled but still sad. I figured I got my wish for twins but only one had stayed implanted.

A couple of weeks later I ended up in the ER with one-sided pelvic pain and spotting. They found very low hCG levels that, upon retests, weren't doubling appropriately. I had a lot of ultrasounds. We watched as an intrauterine gestational sac measuring behind developed a yolk sac but kept getting further behind, then watched as that sac began to reabsorb. The expected miscarriage never came. I had a failed round of misoprostol to pass it. Then another round of misoprostol that seemed to work. I passed a sac. Ultrasound yesterday showed an empty uterus.

Except my hCG levels were still rising. Because it really was twins. The intrauterine one passed, but somewhere, not in either tube because they've had multiple people looking at both tubes for weeks now, there's an ectopic pregnancy still chugging along. They can't find it on ultrasound. We're hoping two rounds (because I'm over 8 weeks so I'm past the point where one is likely to be effective) of methotrexate will take care of it, because if not I'll need potentially extensive exploratory surgery just to find and destroy The Little Embryo That Could before it kills me. 

I cannot believe I have to kill The Little Embryo That Could. What if that stubborn little shit is the best chance I had at another living child? The Womb of Doom tried to take them all. Even my living child is only here after headbutting a decaying fibroid out of his way, then overcoming a huge SCH, preterm labor, and preeclampsia.

I can't do this. I have to do this. And I'm not even done because goddamnit, I'm not quitting until I have another living child or two even if it kills me.

I had some super intense anxiety in the beginning weeks that I had a hard time getting control of. I finally relaxed a bit, especially after we had a good dating scan, and a few weeks later heard her heartbeat on the Doppler at my midwifes office. 
Of course you always have nagging/worrisome feeling in pregnancy, that’s normal, right? I didn’t get big fast like they say happens with your second baby.  No big deal, I have a long torso. But this nagging feeling that I should get genetic testing done would not subside. So I got it. It came back with a 1:5 for Trisomy 18. I was absolutely devastated by this phone call, and in my heart I knew, even though this was just a screening. 
This is the very condensed version of the story, but a week after we got the results from the SIP, we had a detailed ultra sound which showed concerns and then had amniocentesis right after.  The next day we had confirmation, our baby had full Trisomy 18. Our little girl whom we wanted so badly. Our dreams for the future already included her. Our life already included her.  Her parents and big sister were so so so excited she’d be joining our family. Our friends and family were already to welcome her.
With the extensive abnormalities that are often associated with T18, our girls’ were devastating. There was no hope she would survive pregnancy, let along birth and infant hood.  
You have to understand that we wanted this baby so much. We loved this baby. We still cry for her. We still love her. 
I was induced because we decided to take the pain-I would take all the pain so she didn’t have to suffer. It’s an incredibly awful feeling. Our hearts are shattered. We are slowly coming out of the worst of it (I think?) but it’s only been six weeks. 
Trisomy 18 (full) is a total fluke...just bad luck.  So I’m writing this to share my story in part because it makes me feel better to talk about it, partly because I don’t want anyone to forget about my daughter or to pretend she was never here.

The next day we had confirmation, our baby had full Trisomy 18. Our little girl whom we wanted so badly. Our dreams for the future already included her. Our life already included her.  Her parents and big sister were so so so excited she’d be joining our family. Our friends and family were already to welcome her.
With the extensive abnormalities that are often associated with T18, our girls’ were devastating. There was no hope she would survive pregnancy, let along birth and infant hood.<br/>
You have to understand that we wanted this baby so much. We loved this baby. We still cry for her. We still love her. 
I was induced because we decided to take the pain-I would take all the pain so she didn’t have to suffer. It’s an incredibly awful feeling. Our hearts are shattered. We are slowly coming out of the worst of it (I think?) but it’s only been six weeks. 
Trisomy 18 (full) is a total fluke...just bad luck.  So I’m writing this to share my story in part because it makes me feel better to talk about it, partly because I don’t want anyone to forget about my daughter or to pretend she was never here. 
We just picked up her cremated remains today and it stings so deeply. We are TTC which gives us something positive to focus on, but I still am filled with the fear of what ifs. Can we get pregnant, will it be healthy...Overall, trying to stay positive.</p>

My DH and I have been TTC for about a year. 1 blighted ovum and 2 CPs in that time.

Here is my challenge: we have two weddings that we are both standing up in, however, they are at the end of November, one week apart from each other both out of town. One is for a family member and the other for a super close friend. Both weddings are in the same area, just halfway across the country from where DH and I live.

I gave myself a little breather these last two months to get my body back to normal and have some time to process. Our plan is to start trying this next cycle -end of Feb/early March- however, I AM GOING CRAZY!

I have this battle in my brain constantly, sizing up missing two important events I truly want to be a part of OR saying f-it I want a baby and a wedding doesn’t matter. My regular brain knows I want to be able to travel for these weddings, I want to be there and that 3 more weeks of waiting to try isn’t going to make a difference one way or the other. My ‘I need a baby’ brain is making the daily struggle even harder.

My husband and I have been TTC for almost a year. Due to PCOS that’s proven to be only 4 cycles. The last two we were given Femara to induce ovulation and I don’t ovulate naturally. 

Upon getting the PCOS diagnosis I cut gluten, sugar, and dairy from my diet completely as well as made other life changes to remove environmental toxins. 

Imagine my glee when I experience my first natural period (not induced or on birth control) last month. However, the days continued to tick by and I continued to bleed. On day 23 of the bleeding I felt the urge to take a pregnancy test and was shocked by a positive result! 7 more tests all read the same and I’ve never cried harder than saying hello to my husband “you’re going to be a dad”. 

I had blood work done on Friday to confirm and my HCG levels put my at 4 weeks pregnant. The size of a poppy seed. My OBGYN had me repeat the test on Sunday to be sure things were moving in the right direction. 

Today he called with the heartbreaking news that instead of doubling or increasing by 50%, my levels had decreased and it’s indicative of an impending miscarriage. 

I feel so stupid for thinking this could be a healthy pregnancy when I’ve been lightly bleeding for the entirety of it but here I stand devastated. I had 5 days of glimmer and hope and now am stuck with the reality that due to my PCOS this will likely happen again. 

I’m so incredibly impressed by the strength of the women in this sub who have endured far more heart-wrenching losses while I feel totally leveled by the loss our little poppy seed.

&#x200B;

I have a daughter who is 2 years, 3 months. We decided to start trying for a baby in June (She was 20 months), I got pregnant in September, miscarried naturally, after 10 days of spotting in November. I was 9 weeks, the sac measured 5 weeks.

&#x200B;

We started trying to conceive 12 days after miscarriage. My cycle returned 25 days after miscarriage, so we must've missed the egg. We tried December and now January. I thought for sure I'd get pregnant right away; everyone said you're more fertile after miscarriage! I use opks and pay attention to cervical mucus. This past cycle, I got ewcm on day 12 which was way early that I hadn't even begun opks yet. The previous month I got a positive opk on day 15. When I saw ewcm I took an opk and it was positive, so we made sure to have sex an hour later. My husband even came home from work, it was perfect timing.

&#x200B;

The next day I had even more ewcm, and still a positive opk, so my husband came home from work that day as well. Everything was timed perfectly and I got ewcm which I normally don't even get. And it didn't work. And my cycle is still irregular after miscarriage so I'm feeling like it will never work. Like my body is broken now. I normally don't get ewcm so how will sperm ever get to the egg...

&#x200B;

It really sucks to want something so bad, get it, and it doesn't work out and you have to start all over again. When something doesn't go according to plan. We were hoping for a 2.5 year age gap, and now it'll be over 3.

Next month’s cycle came six days early but was also a (mostly) normal period. Abnormalities were that it started with a day of brown spotting and it came early, nothing too concerning just not totally normal. 

This cycle I started my period eight days early, and it’s really concerning to me. The blood is BRIGHT red, when it is normally a deep red. It is really clotty, to the point where when I pee there’s blood drops in the toilet and occasional small clumps coming out. I have never had a period this color or with this type of clotting, and it is very reminiscent of the MC. I am going through tampons much more quickly than normal. There is also low cramping (though nothing close to the intensity of the MC, more like a pressure). 

I tested right before I got my period and it was negative, but I’m really weirded out by the type of period this is and how early it came. Does this sound like anything to anyone? We have been trying since cleared from the MC, so my theories are that maybe an egg was fertilized but didn’t implant?

137,2048,confidence,<praw.reddit.Reddit object at 0x7f12a630cd90>,,ttcafterloss,"The birth of our first child:

Week 19- The anatomy scan was “perfect” except for one small thing that they wanted to check on in two months. (Little did we know there were other things wrong that weren’t mentioned.)

Week 27- The one small thing turned in to a much much larger issue. The doctor downplayed the issue (probably because I was crying and close to a panic attack) and referred me to a high risk doctor. This began the worst month of my entire life. After that appointment, I went into a deep depression filled with the worst anxiety I’ve ever had. There were moments I wished I wasn’t alive. I started taking Zoloft. I lost my personality and wanted my old self back. I wanted nothing more than my baby to be healthy. Every second of every day I worried about him. We had been saving for years to buy a house for our new family. We literally closed on our dream home two days after we found out something was wrong with the baby. It was heartbreaking. It was supposed to be one of the best moments of our lives. We bought this house with our baby in mind and moving in was unimaginably hard.

Week 28- The MFM confirmed the diagnosis and ordered an amnio and TORCH test. Those came back fine in the next week.  She wasn’t overly concerned with the baby.

Week 29- I had a horrible feeling and requested an MRI. The doctor told me that most people in my situation would not get an MRI but she ordered one for us anyways.

Week 30-The MRI came back showing extensive damage. Scientific research showed that babies with this condition would have a very poor quality of life so we decided to TFMR. We told the MFM our choice and she tried to give us so much hope for the baby. I wanted so badly to believe that ""false hope"" and it still haunts me. (We live in a very religious area and through this process so many medical professionals were openly against termination no matter the circumstance.) We requested our MRI report and were shocked to see we were never informed about the other issues with our baby. I cried every hour after we made our choice. Every single baby kick was horribly bitter sweet. He was happy inside of me and it killed me to know what was going to happen to him.

I called the clinic and scheduled the procedure. I was shocked with how professional, understanding and compassionate the ladies were who worked there. Once all my medical documents had been received proving that I was in fact terminating for a medical reason, they put me on the schedule. We booked our flights and hotel.

The night before the procedure I cried the entire night as I held my bump. My husband felt him kick for the last time.

Week 30+4 Day 1: We arrived at the clinic where the procedure would happen. We told nobody. I was terrified. My husband was so strong. I was yet again shocked with how kind the staff was to me. My husband wasn’t allowed to be there for any portion of the termination. He had to wait in the lobby for all 4 days. They did an ultrasound, thankfully they had the screen turned from me and they didn’t make me look. Then they took me to talk with a counselor. She explained the procedure to me and they wanted to make sure nobody was forcing me to get it done. I cried most of the morning thinking about my little boy. Thinking about what would happen to him. How much I would miss him. I was scared. Pretty much anytime anybody spoke to me, I cried. They called my husband in at the end of the counseling to explain to him how to care for me over the next few days and see if he had any concerns. They told me they were ready to start the termination. I asked my husband if we were sure that we were making the right choice. He said yes. We cried and hugged, I didn’t want to let go of him. That was the last time the 3 of us were together. They took me to a room that looked like a regular doctors office room. They put in an IV and gave me an anxiety and pain medicine. It did nothing for me. I had about 5 people helping to calm me down as the doctor inserted that thing that opens up your vagina. I couldn’t stop crying. I felt him kick for the last time. I couldn’t control my crying or my thoughts, I cried so loud. I knew they were about to end my baby’s life. I wanted my husband. They inserted the needle through my cervix into my baby’s head which allowed him to go to sleep peacefully forever. I screamed when they told me it was done. None of it really physically hurt but my heart was shattered. They inserted 4 laminaria sticks to help induce me and I was done for the morning. They had me come back in the afternoon to verify that the injection worked. We went and picked up a prescription for oxycodone and I took one. It numbed all of my body and emotions. When I went back later that day, the doctor did an ultrasound and I asked if my boy was gone. She said “yes, but you knew that though.” She was right, I hadn’t felt any kicks since the injection. I took more oxycodone and didn’t really process the fact that I had my dead sons body in my stomach.

30+5 Day 2: They inserted an IV along with more anxiety drugs. They took out the laminaria sticks and inserted 8 more. My cervix wasn’t ready so they gave me a pill to soften it. They sent me back to the hotel for the day. I took oxycodone as directed on the bottle and slept most of the day. I started to get bad cramps in the middle of the night but nothing too crazy.

30+6 Day 3: They gave me two pills of misoprostol first thing in the morning to hold between my cheek and gum for 30 minutes. I started to get concerned that I didn’t have any cramps. The other women there seemed to be doubled over in pain. My flight was scheduled for the next day and I didn’t want to get sent back to the hotel to try again tomorrow. I asked for a double dose of the IV anxiety meds because I swear what they were giving me didn’t work. They took out the laminaria sticks and said we would try and see if my body would respond. I completely forgot until now that they broke my water. They sent me into a room with 2 other women. We weren’t allowed an epidural and we had been informed that the concentration of drip pain meds wouldn’t do much once we actually started to labor. I heard the lady next to me give birth and get taken away. I was jealous. I sat in my bed and wished I had contractions. They gave me 2 more pills of misoprostol then the pain hit me hard. Any time I moved, the contractions killed me. It was the most intense pain of my life. My expanding cervix blocked my urethra and I was unable to pee. I gladly accepted the catheter as they emptied my bladder. I never thought I would be cool with getting something shoved up my pee hole without an epidural. I felt every bit of it and the relief was worth it. My contractions were so bad they made me wish I had killed myself back in week 27 when I had those thoughts. I cried and screamed for 3 more hours. I pooped myself trying to push out a baby that wasn’t close to being ready to be pushed out. About an hour later I gave up and let the pain take over and thats when he finally started to lower. I pushed and pushed and finally made some progress. They saw his head so they covered my legs so I wouldn’t see. I saw them grab the bag they were going to put him in. I yelled that I wanted them to pull him out and I felt the nurse help spread my vagina and try. I pushed and pushed. My baby’s head was measuring 33+ weeks due to the damage and it sure felt like it. Once his head was out, I gave up. They kept asking me to push more I couldn’t. Once I managed to get his whole body out, fluids spilled everywhere they ran down my back. I was soaked, my sock was soaked. I pushed out the placenta and then I looked up and saw them take my boy away in his bag. At this point everything happened so fast. I went limp and they sat me up, contained all my fluids and whisked me away to an empty room. I don’t remember the trip to the other room, all I remember was feeling so empty and lifeless. They quickly transferred me to a different bed. I felt like I had nothing left. My vagina felt like shredded meat and they very urgently did a uterus massage. The doctor came in and did a D&C to remove what was left of my placenta. She told me that I had torn my cervix. I don’t remember what else happened…all I know was that I felt so sad. They made me stay for the next few hours to watch my bleeding. I think I saw pitocin was in my IV bag. I was still unable to pee so they did another catheter on me. I was able to pee on my own later that afternoon and then they sent me on my way. I don’t remember much about what we did that evening, I guess I slept.

Week 31 (4th day at the clinic) We stayed in bed until about 11am then we packed our bags and went to the funeral home. My husband picked out his urn. It was the exact urn that I was thinking of. When I told my husband it was beautiful, he had a breakdown. It broke my heart to see him so sad. We signed the paperwork to have our baby cremated and mailed to us. We got lunch and then went back to the clinic. They took us into a private room to show us our baby. I was terrified to see him. Completely terrified. This is my first child and I had no clue what kind of emotions this would bring out. I was shaking with fear. What would he look like after I so violently pushed him out of my vagina? What would he look like after being dead for 3 days. Would I be overcome with tremendous guilt? The counselor was there to talk us through these emotions before they brought him out. Once we were ready, they brought him out in a cute little basket. He was under a blanket. I uncovered him and he was swaddled with a blue hat on. He was beautiful. We both had a breakdown. We took turns holding him and being his parents. I can’t stop crying as I type this. We unswaddled him and looked at his cute little hands and feet. They let us stay with him for as long as we needed. It felt like nearly 45 minutes and I didnt want to leave him. Although he was cold, he still felt perfect. He was our child. They gave us a memory box with pictures of him and his hand and foot prints. When they took him, they brought us back his little hat and swaddle blanket. I miss my baby so fucking much. When we left the clinic we went straight to the airport and were home just a few hours later. We walked in our dark, new, empty house and cried. (I know I didn't say too many good things about the clinic for obvious reasons...but they did an absolutely amazing job of caring for me and comforting me in the worst time of my life. I am very thankful for them and how they took care of me and my baby.)

Today: My milk came in with a vengeance (super engorged, hot and painful but I haven't actually seen any milk....)  I have about 3 oxycodone left and will take one per day along with the ibuprofen they prescribed to help me through the next few days of boob and vagina pain. Hopefully by then I won’t need anymore medication. I’ve been struggling to go through the motions this weekend. My husband has been making sure I get out of bed each morning and take care of myself. I’m planning on going back to work sometime this week. Everybody knows my baby was stillborn and I think I have a good support system. I’m hoping we can start trying again around my due date (late march/early April.) We want to meet with a different MFM who will help us figure out if it was genetic before we try. Anyways…I know this was long and I’m not sure what the point was. I guess it was therapeutic to type out. We are calling counselors tomorrow to see if we can get help.

<p>Week 19- The anatomy scan was “perfect” except for one small thing that they wanted to check on in two months. (Little did we know there were other things wrong that weren’t mentioned.)</p>

<p>Week 27- The one small thing turned in to a much much larger issue. The doctor downplayed the issue (probably because I was crying and close to a panic attack) and referred me to a high risk doctor. This began the worst month of my entire life. After that appointment, I went into a deep depression filled with the worst anxiety I’ve ever had. There were moments I wished I wasn’t alive. I started taking Zoloft. I lost my personality and wanted my old self back. I wanted nothing more than my baby to be healthy. Every second of every day I worried about him. We had been saving for years to buy a house for our new family. We literally closed on our dream home two days after we found out something was wrong with the baby. It was heartbreaking. It was supposed to be one of the best moments of our lives. We bought this house with our baby in mind and moving in was unimaginably hard.</p>

<p>Week 28- The MFM confirmed the diagnosis and ordered an amnio and TORCH test. Those came back fine in the next week.  She wasn’t overly concerned with the baby.</p>

<p>Week 29- I had a horrible feeling and requested an MRI. The doctor told me that most people in my situation would not get an MRI but she ordered one for us anyways.</p>

<p>Week 30-The MRI came back showing extensive damage. Scientific research showed that babies with this condition would have a very poor quality of life so we decided to TFMR. We told the MFM our choice and she tried to give us so much hope for the baby. I wanted so badly to believe that &quot;false hope&quot; and it still haunts me. (We live in a very religious area and through this process so many medical professionals were openly against termination no matter the circumstance.) We requested our MRI report and were shocked to see we were never informed about the other issues with our baby. I cried every hour after we made our choice. Every single baby kick was horribly bitter sweet. He was happy inside of me and it killed me to know what was going to happen to him.</p>

<p>I called the clinic and scheduled the procedure. I was shocked with how professional, understanding and compassionate the ladies were who worked there. Once all my medical documents had been received proving that I was in fact terminating for a medical reason, they put me on the schedule. We booked our flights and hotel.</p>

<p>The night before the procedure I cried the entire night as I held my bump. My husband felt him kick for the last time.</p>

<p>Week 30+4 Day 1: We arrived at the clinic where the procedure would happen. We told nobody. I was terrified. My husband was so strong. I was yet again shocked with how kind the staff was to me. My husband wasn’t allowed to be there for any portion of the termination. He had to wait in the lobby for all 4 days. They did an ultrasound, thankfully they had the screen turned from me and they didn’t make me look. Then they took me to talk with a counselor. She explained the procedure to me and they wanted to make sure nobody was forcing me to get it done. I cried most of the morning thinking about my little boy. Thinking about what would happen to him. How much I would miss him. I was scared. Pretty much anytime anybody spoke to me, I cried. They called my husband in at the end of the counseling to explain to him how to care for me over the next few days and see if he had any concerns. They told me they were ready to start the termination. I asked my husband if we were sure that we were making the right choice. He said yes. We cried and hugged, I didn’t want to let go of him. That was the last time the 3 of us were together. They took me to a room that looked like a regular doctors office room. They put in an IV and gave me an anxiety and pain medicine. It did nothing for me. I had about 5 people helping to calm me down as the doctor inserted that thing that opens up your vagina. I couldn’t stop crying. I felt him kick for the last time. I couldn’t control my crying or my thoughts, I cried so loud. I knew they were about to end my baby’s life. I wanted my husband. They inserted the needle through my cervix into my baby’s head which allowed him to go to sleep peacefully forever. I screamed when they told me it was done. None of it really physically hurt but my heart was shattered. They inserted 4 laminaria sticks to help induce me and I was done for the morning. They had me come back in the afternoon to verify that the injection worked. We went and picked up a prescription for oxycodone and I took one. It numbed all of my body and emotions. When I went back later that day, the doctor did an ultrasound and I asked if my boy was gone. She said “yes, but you knew that though.” She was right, I hadn’t felt any kicks since the injection. I took more oxycodone and didn’t really process the fact that I had my dead sons body in my stomach.</p>

<p>30+5 Day 2: They inserted an IV along with more anxiety drugs. They took out the laminaria sticks and inserted 8 more. My cervix wasn’t ready so they gave me a pill to soften it. They sent me back to the hotel for the day. I took oxycodone as directed on the bottle and slept most of the day. I started to get bad cramps in the middle of the night but nothing too crazy.</p>

<p>30+6 Day 3: They gave me two pills of misoprostol first thing in the morning to hold between my cheek and gum for 30 minutes. I started to get concerned that I didn’t have any cramps. The other women there seemed to be doubled over in pain. My flight was scheduled for the next day and I didn’t want to get sent back to the hotel to try again tomorrow. I asked for a double dose of the IV anxiety meds because I swear what they were giving me didn’t work. They took out the laminaria sticks and said we would try and see if my body would respond. I completely forgot until now that they broke my water. They sent me into a room with 2 other women. We weren’t allowed an epidural and we had been informed that the concentration of drip pain meds wouldn’t do much once we actually started to labor.

I have a sister-in-law who has a kind of martyr complex about her kids, and I am having a hard time being around her.

For example, I do kick-boxing, and someone asked her if she does too, and she responds ""I would, but I have kids.""  She does this constantly.  First, what a messed up view of being a parent.  I feel so bad for her kids having to hear that.  And second, she knows exactly what we've been going through these past 2 years and still does this around me and expects my support about how hard it is to be a parent. 

I had one of my miscarriages on a family vacation, and she comments later, when I had not brought up the subject, ""You must have had the worst vacation in history, except for that one lady who killed herself.  And at least she got what she wanted.""  Like, thanks?  I think she might legit have Asperger's, but she's super defensive about it - insisting everyone else keeps misinterpreting her words and never apologizing.  I've tried to be patient with her the whole time I've known her, but I just can't handle it now.

We used to spend a lot of time with them, but I have been reducing contact with her.  Unfortunately she's taking it personally.  I tried to explain over email why her comments hurt me, but she took it personally and did the ""I can't just forget my children!"" and tried to guilt trip me about how much her kids love me and I'm abandoning them.

How do you deal with insensitive people you can&#39;t avoid?  I have a sister-in-law who has a kind of martyr complex about her kids, and I am having a hard time being around her.</p>

<p>For example, I do kick-boxing, and someone asked her if she does too, and she responds &quot;I would, but I have kids.&quot;  She does this constantly.  First, what a messed up view of being a parent.  I feel so bad for her kids having to hear that.  And second, she knows exactly what we&#39;ve been going through these past 2 years and still does this around me and expects my support about how hard it is to be a parent. </p>

<p>I had one of my miscarriages on a family vacation, and she comments later, when I had not brought up the subject, &quot;You must have had the worst vacation in history, except for that one lady who killed herself.  And at least she got what she wanted.&quot;  Like, thanks?  I think she might legit have Asperger&#39;s, but she&#39;s super defensive about it - insisting everyone else keeps misinterpreting her words and never apologizing.  I&#39;ve tried to be patient with her the whole time I&#39;ve known her, but I just can&#39;t handle it now.</p>

<p>We used to spend a lot of time with them, but I have been reducing contact with her.  Unfortunately she&#39;s taking it personally.  I tried to explain over email why her comments hurt me, but she took it personally and did the &quot;I can&#39;t just forget my children!&quot; and tried to guilt trip me about how much her kids love me and I&#39;m abandoning them.

I won't be able to have a full infertility panel done until after my third MC, but I'd rather avoid this as I'm sure everyone would. My nurse has agreed for me to call in when I do fall pregnant again so they can monitor my HCG and Progesterone.

Things I'm doing now to be proactive: Progesterone Cream 2x per day (double dose as far as number of pumps. Haven't felt any side effects so figure I could be very low), 81 mg baby aspirin per day, vitamin B Complex, Magnesium and CoQ10 to aid in potential estrogen dominance.

Is there anything else I could ask my doctor to do during my next pregnancy? Any other blood work, medications, pregnancy-safe tests? Will the progesterone cream that I'm using make my progesterone numbers seem fine and prevent me from being prescribed progesterone suppositories?

<p>I won&#39;t be able to have a full infertility panel done until after my third MC, but I&#39;d rather avoid this as I&#39;m sure everyone would. My nurse has agreed for me to call in when I do fall pregnant again so they can monitor my HCG and Progesterone.</p>

<p>Things I&#39;m doing now to be proactive: Progesterone Cream 2x per day (double dose as far as number of pumps. Haven&#39;t felt any side effects so figure I could be very low), 81 mg baby aspirin per day, vitamin B Complex, Magnesium and CoQ10 to aid in potential estrogen dominance.</p>

<p>Is there anything else I could ask my doctor to do during my next pregnancy? Any other blood work, medications, pregnancy-safe tests? Will the progesterone cream that I&#39;m using make my progesterone numbers seem fine and prevent me from being prescribed progesterone suppositories? </p>

<p>I&#39;m really not wanting to go through heartache again. I appreciate your suggestions!</p>

I had two very different kinds of losses last year (stillbirth at 39-4 in August and a MMC at 8 weeks in December), and I’ve really been struggling lately with guilt over grieving those losses differently.

(TW: details of stillbirth)

Basically I’m feeling guilty about being disproportionately sad about the stillbirth in comparison to the miscarriage. Everything about the stillbirth (the experience, the baby, the aftermath, the what-could-have-beens, etc) dominates my thoughts and completely overshadows the baby I lost in December.

I know it’s partly because the experience was traumatic (I went to the hospital in labor, thinking everything was fine - only to discover when we got there that she didn’t have a heartbeat).

I know it’s partly because I felt her moving inside me for months and got to know her rhythms and preferences. She got the hiccups almost every evening. The last couple of weeks, when I tapped my belly a certain way, she would tap/kick back. It was like getting to have a conversation with her. I felt like I knew her.

I know it’s partly because I gave birth to her, saw her, held her, and named her. I have pictures of her. I know exactly what we lost.

I know it’s partly because when I got pregnant again in October I so closely guarded my heart that I didn’t let myself get my hopes up that the pregnancy would actually lead to a live baby. I couldn’t bear to feel that devastation again, so I didn’t let myself “buy in” to the pregnancy that early on. When I found out I was miscarrying, it seemed like an inevitability.

But despite all this, my miscarried baby was my child too. I saw its little heartbeat. It mattered too. I feel so guilty for crying so many tears over one and not as many over the other. It really sucks to feel all the sadness, and then guilt over the sadness on top of it.

I’m currently in the TWW hoping to get my rainbow baby. If/when I do get pregnant, I’m going to try REALLY hard to give that baby the love and confidence and hope from the start that I denied the one I miscarried. I’m afraid of getting crushed again, but I think not getting my hopes up last time hurt more than it helped.

I don’t really know if I’m asking for advice or what. This has just been weighing on me and I can’t really talk about it with friends or family without feeling like a crazy person. Thank goodness for this space.

It is truly heartbreaking to hear your stories, tho it has been very comforting to know I’m not alone in my sadness. Although this is my first ever Reddit post, I have been reading your posts and comments for several months. I’m reaching out to you because I am conflicted about whether to see a RE or just keep trying. I have two healthy kids (2 yrs and 4 yrs old), but this past year I had two miscarriages. The first one we found out in May at the 12 week ultrasound, the baby stopped growing at 9 weeks and I had no signs that I had lost the baby. It was devastating. In November we found out at 8 weeks that we had another miscarriage, this time it was a blighted ovum.  After both miscarriages I had to have D&C’s b/c I didn’t miscarry naturally. A few Ob/gyns at my practice have said that they are 99% sure it’s a chromosomal issue and they think I should just keep trying. I don’t know if I can handle another miscarriage so I insisted on blood work and a semen analysis. The blood work was all normal (thyroid, diabetes, antiphospholipid syndrome) The semen analysis said “very mild esthonospermia” which impacts motility, but we have not had any issues getting pregnant . My insurance wouldn’t cover an RE after two miscarriages so I became comfortable and trusting of the idea to try again without more tests. We were just getting ready to try again, when my dr told me that because of how long we have been TTC I can see an RE at the end of February. I feel like I just adjusted and began to trust enough to try again and I’m just afraid that the RE’s tests delay will delay us TTC and put us on an emotional roller-coaster without a benefit. I don’t want to do IVF so I’m not really sure what benefit the RE will provide for miscarriage when we don’t have trouble conceiving. My ob/gyn also said that babies conceived within 6 months after miscarriage decreases risk of miscarriage and health issues. I’m 36.5 yrs old btw. Thank you very much in advance for your advice.

The genetic testing revealed trisomy 16. The doctor said while he hates to use the term ""good news"", this is fairly good news because it doesn't indicate anything wrong with my husband or I and it is more just a ""bad luck"" situation. I was feeling (relatively) good about our conversation. He said genetic counseling is available but probably not needed at this point. 

Today I logged onto the patient portal to review the full pathology results. The first thing I saw was ""XY"". I searched the karotype information an confirmed that meant the baby I lost was a boy. That was really hard - I would have been happy regardless of gender but my preference was a boy, though I thought surely we'd have a girl (for no real scientific reason, just a feeling). It kind of shifted my thinking from ""I lost a pregnancy incompatible with life"" to ""I lost a son"".

Then I went back and read the report again and noticed a line that said ""It has been reported that there is a 1.8-fold increase in risk for a different viable trisomy (like trisomy 21) after a previous nonviable trisomy has been detected in a spontaneous abort!on."" I very much want to get pregnant again and had some vague fears around having another miscarriage or not being able to get pregnant but now I am scared I am going to get pregnant and my baby will have something wrong with him/her. When pathology came back with an ""answer"" I thought I was fortunate to know what happened, but now it seems to be giving me something concrete to worry over. I really want to be positive, I know the odds for bad things happening are still low, and I know it's in my best interest to be calm and unstressed. However I can't help but to feel so unlucky - I read it was a 3% chance of having a MMC, and a 1% chance of having trisomy 16 - and like I might get unlucky again. And then I feel like by thinking these things I am just attracting more bad - like I am putting my negativity out into the universe and the universe is going to give it back. 

I know this is all ridiculously illogical, I just needed to say it. The few people I've shared that I've had a MC with have tried  to be supportive but mostly have said (unintentionally) insensitive things, I feel like I have no one to discuss this anxiety with. I reviewed the report with my husband but I don't want to tell him the extent of my worry, and maybe make him worry more too.

Hey there. We've had two losses since beginning to try for #2 in October (chemical pregnancy in November, and MC at 8 weeks this past weekend). We have only had one other pregnancy prior to this, which resulted in our son 4 years ago.

&#x200B;

I posted in /r/CautiousBB, and someone mentioned that we should ask our OB for testing based on these two losses. My OB noted that as soon as I get a positive test, I should call her and she will do bloodwork and more monitoring for any future pregnancies. But should I ask her for any testing now to rule out problems? I know the number that always gets used is three losses before they will test, and I'm not sure that they would count the chemical as a loss (which makes no sense to me, by the way). If we were to try again and experience another MC, I don't know that we'd have the strength to try any more after that. 

&#x200B;

Additional info: I have a slight autoimmune issue that causes a lupus rash on my skin from time to time. It's very mild, and I've only ever had mildly positive ANA test results. During my pregnancy with my son, I tested positive for a Sjogren's antibody and so I was monitored by a Maternal Fetal Medicine specialist to ensure there were no cardiac issues with the baby. However, there were no abnormalities found at the anatomy scan and I was allowed to return to my regular OB after that.

So my 6th and 17th chromosomes have a equal sized piece switched.

It was a whole shitload to unpack - did a lot of crying yesterday...

Posting this for my sanity and to help anyone searching for symptoms like theirs if they’re worried it’s ectopic. I had trouble finding experiences that looked like mine and was in limbo for a week + thinking I might be crazy or pushing my doctors for no reason. If anyone who finds this ever feels the same—-push your damn doctors. You will feel better to be proven crazy than to have something horrible happen to you. Trust your gut. 

On New Year’s Eve my faint positive went away and what I thought was AF started, so I assumed I was experiencing a CP.

Two weeks later—two weeks filled with highlighting my hair, too much wine, and not being great with prenatal vitamins because sad—I took a test on a whim and had a big ass BFP. I was immediately concerned and practically had to fight my OBGYN’s office to see me and check my levels and the first doctor I saw told me it was probably leftover chemical at first. But I pushed for blood tests and it turned out that Hcg was rising normally with progesterone just a little on the low side. I had no regular ectopic symptoms other than what I had thought was AF two weeks before and no risk factors so then they told me not to worry and wait it out. 

I pushed for an ultrasound where they didn’t find anything but referred me to a radiologist to double check because I must have seemed a bit “I will sue you if you fuck this up.” Radiologist found swelling in my right tube Thursday, but because my HCG was rising normally but still too low to see anything via ultrasound, they recommended waiting until Monday when they thought they would be able to confirm where the pregnancy was.

Yesterday the radiologist confirmed the swelling in my right tube had gotten bigger and I got two very dignified injections of methotrexate into my butt. Now I’m trying to figure out what I can and can’t eat (my doctor said to eat like normal but doctor internet hive mind disagrees) and hoping my levels go down the way they should. One of my cats has been attached to me since my first BFP and my biggest fear is that she’ll springboard off my uterus and cause my tube to rupture. 

I’ve been weepy on and off but I don’t think this has fully hit me yet. Being in limbo for the last week was the worst part. I was convinced every twinge or feeling from my middle meant it was a normal pregnancy and that it would be ok and it wasn’t. We’re on hold for at least three months now and my OBGYN has recommended an HSG before we start trying again, which I’m happy about. 

This is a terrible club to join and I’m so sorry for everything anyone here has experienced. May this be the worst thing that ever happens to us (a mantra DH and I keep repeating). ❤️

Last  January I got pregnant and my husband can't keep a secret to save his  life - he told EVERYONE. He just gets so excited, he can't contain  himself. He told family, friends, everyone, and I even joined in a  little, because yeah, it's exciting!

Two  weeks after I found out, I started bleeding. For a couple of weeks it  seemed like the pregnancy could be saved, but no... not if it's that  early. I was around seven weeks in.

Two  weeks of incredibly heavy bleeding and plate-sized clots, a D&C,  then six months of not ovulating because my body decided it needed a  break, apparently, and then exams, and everything went back to normal  and we began to try again.

My husband is on a work trip and my period is quite late, but I can't be sure because it's been really irregular lately.

I  have a pregnancy test in my bathroom cupboard but I don't want to use  it. I'm not the kind of person who postpones stuff, I always think that  it's better to know than not to know, but this time... I can't.

If I'm pregnant, I don't want to know, I don't want anybody to know.

The  possibility of going through all that shit again is paralyzing to say  the least - and I don't even mean just losing the pregnancy (it's not  even a baby at this point). I don't want to deal with the EXPECTATIONS.  With the grandparents hovering and going crazy, with people asking me  how I'm doing, friends getting excited, dealing with the pressure of it -  because if it goes wrong again, I don't know how I'm going to deal with  this. I was never comfortable with giving explanations, with justifying  what I do and how I behave, and this is... so private.

So I'm working really hard not to talk about this to anyone. Not even my sister, not even my best friends. Not even my husband.

Have any of you gone through this? How did you deal with it?

223,2048,confidence,<praw.reddit.Reddit object at 0x7f12a630cd90>,,ttcafterloss," In 2018 we suffered two pregnancy losses. I don't have to explain to this group how devastating these experiences were, how broken I felt. The first one, our first pregnancy, was especially painful physically, and I felt shattered for a while. I wanted to share with you guys some things that have helped me feel better emotionally. To be clear, I don't want to preach. This may not resonate with you and that's ok, but I do hope that this is as helpful to you as it has been for me. 

My husband is a social worker and he introduced me to the concept of 'radical acceptance'. As first I balked at it, but it rang a bell with things that I've learned through years of meditation. To start with, there's a bit of a linguistics issue with the phrase 'radical acceptance' in that the word acceptance has a positive connotation. To say ""I accept you"" conveys a sense of positive endorsement. In this case, radical acceptance means accepting circumstances as they are and not resisting what you cannot change. This applies perfectly to pregnancy loss. Every doctor I saw told me there was nothing I could have done differently to stop the miscarriage from happening. This is the circumstance I cannot change. 

Radical acceptance differentiates between pain and suffering. Pain is the immediate feeling. It was the moment it really hit me walking down the sidewalk after our doctor's appointment when we knew the baby was gone, when I just broke down on my husband's shoulder. Pain was the loss of our hopes. Pain was calling our parents to tell them. 

Suffering is built on pain, but different from it. Suffering is what you do with the pain and the mental interpretation you put into the pain. Suffering was that, for months and months after, I would cry every day, sometimes at random times. Suffering was when I would get lost in my ruminations about how I was getting too old to have a baby and every pregnancy would be a loss and then we'd never have a family and....

The point is that the pain is not optional; the suffering is. The circumstances are that I've had two pregnancy losses and I can't change that. However, I can change how I interact mentally with my pain. This sounds easier than it is. Radical acceptance is hard work because you have to learn to accept what you don't want to be true. I've learned to say to myself, ""This seriously sucks. It hurts. But I can't change it. I don't have to agree with it, but I do need to accept that it's a part of my life."" That's why the acceptance is radical; to say that I accept it as a part of my life even though I desperately want it to be different. By not accepting these painful circumstances is what leads to long drawn out emotional suffering. 

To be clear, radical acceptance does not mean inaction. It doesn't mean we've stopped trying to get pregnant. It doesn't mean I'm going to stop trying to figure out what the issue is and fix it. It's something that I'm still grappling with. Sometimes I start going down the mental path of thinking about how we were supposed to have a month old baby right now. Or I get angry that my friend, who I love, got pregnant on the first try. Or upset that I have to participate in yet another baby shower at work. But I'm learning to tell myself that yes, this sucks and it hurts, but I have to accept it. And through that acceptance, I've found healing and peace.",t2_p8ed5,False,,0,False,Radical acceptance - about what's helped me cope,[],r/ttcafterloss,False,0,,0,,,False,t3_ahxrz5,False,dark,1.0,,public,57,0,{},,,False,[],,False,False,,{},,False,57,,False,self,False,,[],{},,True,,1548021088.0,text,0,,,text,self.ttcafterloss,False,"<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=""md""><p>In 2018 we suffered two pregnancy losses.

I've had three miscarriages, the most recent one this last week resulted in my second ectopic pregnancy in my right fallopian tube that ruptured and an emergency surgery after I started hemorrhaging so... no more right tube. I'm sitting here in bed nursing my wounds and trying not to have a full on mental breakdown. Naturally.

I'm convinced my other tube is damaged as well. I had an IUD that my body rejected years and years ago and I'm sure the scarring in my tube is what caused the ectopics so, yeah. I'll be getting testing done to see if the left one is healthy once I'm healed up from this last fiasco but I doubt it.

I know I'm emotional, I'm on pain meds, I'm angry, I'm depressed, I'm probably not in my right mind but I almost just told my husband I wanted a divorce because he said he doesn't consider IVF nor having a surrogate ""natural"". 

He's known from the beginning that I've always wanted children, my own children, and that I have health issues that might make having my own children ""the old fashioned way"" difficult, not only including my damaged reproductive system, I also have a few minor physical disabilities. 

He praised the doctors that just saved my life, was so grateful for the medical interventions that just kept me alive but for some reason rejects the medical interventions that could give us children? I don't get it. 

I even have a best friend who's offered to be a surrogate for me since I was a teenager and suffered the major injury that caused my disabilities. She reminded me of this offer when I got married. She's an amazing person and we'd be LUCKY for her to carry our child. We wouldn't have to worry about her eating unhealthy, drinking, smoking, or using drugs which is a huge concern for people using surrogates (what they do when you're not looking), not to mention she's practically a sister to me and would be involved in the child's life and a great influence.

I'm just lost for words and emotions and I'm afraid I'll end my marriage over this. Then I'd have nothing. No husband and no children. Is this a hill worth dying on? I don't know. I'm afraid I'll resent him for the rest of our lives if he denies me the chance to have our own children any way we can.

Again, I just lost my third baby. I probably shouldn't even be talking about this with him but it's all I can think about for obvious reasons and I'm just APPALLED that he'd say no to having our own children because it's not ""the old fashioned way"".
