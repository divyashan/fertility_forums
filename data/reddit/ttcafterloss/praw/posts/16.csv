2015 was supposed to be the best year of mummies and daddies lives. I had my 21st birthday in January and daddy and I began to plan our beautiful wedding in Florida in October. Grandpa lives there now, we were so excited to see him and get married, just the two of us and Grandpa. 

Then you surprised us baby boy, two pink lines on a test strip. Daddy and I were so scared to be parents, but you were so loved from the beginning. I was 16 weeks pregnant with you when daddy became my husband, on the pier on a beautiful lake in Florida on the 13th of October this year.

I remember when he saw me in my dress, he smiled at me and said ""hello beautiful"" before taking my hand and leading me up the pier to make me [his wife](http://imgur.com/JXS9v50).

Afterwards we posed for pictures, holding up a balloon reading [""it's a boy!""](http://imgur.com/k4EwhiQ). We'd found out the day before that you were our son, our little boy. We shared the news in our wedding picture.

I remember your [gender ultrasound](http://imgur.com/Ypz6rgn), you patted your belly and waved at us. You were being a little stinker and refusing to give away your gender. We heard your beautiful heartbeat and had it put into a toy turtle.

I was so sure you were a girl, I had a name picked out and told daddy he could pick the name if you were a boy. Well he didn't forget that son, and daddy insisted on naming you. James George Campbell he named you, after both of daddies grandparents.

Back home mummy and daddy had a wedding party for family and friends, the DJ asked us if we wanted a first dance to which we replied that it wasn't our thing, we were quiet people. Well that naughty DJ heckled us on to the dance floor anyway. He played [""Heaven"" by Bryan Adams](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3eT464L1YRA) and the three of us [shared that dance together](http://imgur.com/npDsh5J). The music was so loud you were kicking and wiggling in protest.

A few days later you went still, and the hospital told us that you were gone. Our precious James, oh how we sobbed for you.

We thought we were promised you. We should have had you until the day we died. I was induced and on the 11th December 2015 you were born weighing 1lb 5oz. [So tiny but so so perfect](http://imgur.com/yJE8sAW). [Daddy was so strong for me](http://imgur.com/FEdjlXt), he kept me going for you, for us. 

You had daddies lips and mummies nose, and your [second toes were longer than your big toes](http://imgur.com/CNCVVqS) like both of us! My heart felt like it was going to burst with love when I set eyes on you. [I could have drank in that sight forever](http://imgur.com/dVVrPBx). But 14 hours after you were born, you were carried away from us. The next time we saw you, you were in your [little blue coffin](http://imgur.com/dVVrPBx). So small but still miles too big for you.

I cried when I remembered about the turtle containing your heartbeat, I'm terrified to press it in case it stops one day, just like yours did. 

Your funeral is on December 30th, we're playing ""Heaven"" by Bryan Adams again as your coffin goes away.

I have a UTI.

I've been peeing a lot all day, even though I've had barely anything to drink (I know dehydration is bad, but drinking makes me nauseated....I'm trying to balance...).  I had similar symptoms last week for 2 days, and I asked people around here what they thought.  I heard stories of women having UTIs with no pain, and even without symptoms at all.  I thought I'd give it one more day before seeing my doctor, and on the last day, my frequent urination went away, so I thought I was fine.  I felt fine for a week, then the frequent urination started today.

Since I'm leaving the province (including a 5 hour plane ride!) first thing Monday morning, I thought it would be wise to see a doctor, just in case, and to have the peace of mind.  I really wanted to hear that it was just baby sitting on my bladder, and that I would have to get used to it.  Turns out, it's a UTI after all.

Is it normal to get faint lines when you usually don&#39;t get anything at all? Thanks again for everything. You all are amazing people.</p>

Even though this is my first post, I want you all to know that I have been lurking for the past week and you all have been so incredibly helpful. I found out that I was pregnant a week ago today. Two days later I began bleeding and cramping. I went in on Tuesday for a blood test and my hcg and progesterone levels were very very low. I pretty much knew I was miscarrying due to the amount of blood and cramping. The nurse called me in the evening on Wednesday and said that the doctor wanted me to come in on Thursday for another hcg and progesterone test. The problem: I won't find out the results until Monday. I feel like I am in this weird twilight zone. Question: How long can I expect to continue bleeding heavily? I feel like it's never going to end and every time I go to the restroom it's another reminder. 

My second question: My husband's company is having a Christmas party tonight. I desperately do not want to be around people.

My husband and I started trying to conceive this year.  I was excited when I became pregnant on my second cycle.  But sadly that pregnancy ended as a missed miscarriage.  We decided to try again, and I got pregnant again on the first cycle we tried.  That was in September.  But again, I had a missed miscarriage.  I just had the D&C at the beginning of this month.

We were able to get genetic testing done on the ""products of conception"" (I really hate how that sounds... It's not a product, it's my baby) this time, and we found out the baby had a genetic problem called trisomy 10, which is not compatible with life.

The doctor said this most likely points to it being a random anomaly, but me being me, I started googling trisomy 10 like crazy.  There wasn't much information, but what little I was able to find says this almost always happens due to a balanced translocation in one of the parents.  My husband and I are getting blood work done at the end of this month to check this, but I'm really confused and anxious now.  We want to try again as soon as possible, but these losses are ripping me to shreds both physically and emotionally.  I don't want to go through it again.

I'm hoping to find others who have experienced a trisomy 10 loss, because basically everything I found was scholarly articles and Wikipedia type pages.  

Has anyone here experienced this?  Where you able to go on to have a healthy pregnancy?  Was it just a random thing, or did it point to a greater problem like a balanced translocation?

Hi everyone.  I've been lurking and posting a bit so I thought I should introduce myself.  Not sure if that's a ""thing"" that people ""do"" here but I feel weird commenting without saying who I am.

My story, if you're interested, is as follows.  I was diagnosed with PCOS at 16.  Started TTC about 6 months after my husband and I got married.  Got pregnant on our first try.  At my first u/s, they said the baby was measuring 10 days behind, but it was fine (I knew it was a bad sign because I had been charting, and based on my chart and our timing I knew my dates weren't that far off).  Went back for a follow up u/s a week later.  There'd been some growth and there's a heartbeat now (still measuring behind though).  Another u/s another week later and the heartbeat is gone.  I tried 2 rounds of cytotec, which did nothing, and ended up with a d&c.

We started trying again as soon as we could, and 10 months later I got pregnant.  I had just switched to a higher dose of metformin and gone on a low carb diet, and the BFP came the next cycle.  My pregnancy was generally healthy and uneventful, and my son was born in May 2013.

We started trying for #2 in September 2015.  I jumped right in with charting, low-carb, and metformin.  Two cycles later, pregnant again.  At u/s #1, the baby was measuring over a week behind.  At u/s #2, some growth and a heartbeat.  At u/s #3, no heartbeat.  I went straight for the d&c, which I had the day before Thanksgiving.

So, those are the quick & dirty details.  I've been struggling a lot with loss #2.  The first loss was hard, yes, but this time around I am blaming myself, which I didn't do the first time.  The first time around I felt like it was a fluke, bad luck, one of those things, whatever.  Yes, I was sad, and I grieved.  But this time I can't shake the feeling that my body choked the life out of a baby.  It's completely irrational but it's how I feel.

Other things....I'm 37 and my husband is about to turn 40.  I work in a healthcare-related field and he works in education.  We have a dog.  We like Netflix and pizza.  I'm addicted to Diet Coke.

Nice to meet you.  Sorry we're all here.

Started spotting last night. My bleeding has picked up to the point today where I'm essentially just having my period. It was due today, so despite the positive test I saw this morning, I guess I have another CP on my hands pending HCG results.

The doctor I saw today sent me in for an ultrasound (?!) after telling me ""well, it could be an old wives tale but maybe you should just stop until things calm down"" (?!?!), which made me feel like this is all my fault for even TRYING to have a baby. I burst into tears the moment I walked into the ultrasound room. It was the same tech I've seen all three times and she was like ""I know, I know -- 4 weeks 1 day, why did they even send you here?""

The doctor said he would base whether or not to do a repeating test based on what he saw on the ultrasound which is obviously going to be nothing at all even if I WAS pregnant with a healthy baby. She did an external and internal, just in the name of doing what they had asked. I am so frustrated, and also so beyond caring about results or hope this time -- I just want the doctor BS to be over. I want to feel peace, somehow. 

So she was going to call him, and he's supposed to call the nurse practitioner and SOMEBODY is supposed to call me at some point. I have a January 8 appointment already booked with the NP and will be asking her about a) next steps -- are we being referred to a fertility specialist? b) do we just stop trying now, because I feel like my body is fucking toxic and I'm just asking for more trouble, and c) I want some anti-anxiety meds. 

I have no idea where to go from here. This is insane. All semblances of what I expected, what I thought I could salvage from my original hopes, they're gone. I don't feel as sharply bad as I did with the 6 week loss, because I was barely pregnant this time, but I'm fucking MAD. And sad, and so very scared of the future. 

Thank you for listening to me while I've been a brief member of the alumni group. I am probably taking a big step back from social media/online activity for awhile until I get my feet under me, because I hate this telling/untelling/telling/untelling cycle, and I want to find a way to seek out whatever peace I can.

I told him that is not healthy and I want him to be able to grieve. Obviously I know we are different and he may have to come on his own terms.

My boss has given me till next Tuesday to come back, unless I need more time. She's an amazing woman. I love my job and feel like it will be rharapy for me so I'll be glad to go back and distract myself. One of my coworkers is 10w and I'm not sure how I will feel, but we'll see.

I have random moments where I break down and cry, but mostly I feel like a zombie. We've not talked about it since we left the doctor and made no decisions about the future, he just holds me when I cry.

My husband is incredibly patient and would wait months more if that's what I wanted. But I felt like we should resume normalcy. We have to use protection as I'm not cleared to TTC yet due to the methotrexate / my AVM diagnosis being unclear.  

So last night I bought some wine for me, some mixers for him and we had a few drinks. Then I just *could not stop*. I finished the entire bottle, then had *two gins* to cap it off. My husband isn't a huge drinker, and is twice my size, so wasn't anywhere near my level of trashed.  

It was a fun night, don't get me wrong, probably not wise on a work night, but we did have a bit of a ""letting our hair down"" evening.  

It took me till 11pm to get the courage up, and we did the deed. I honestly have only blurry memories of the entire night. I know it was loving and what not, but my whole night is patchy (and I'm seedy today).  

I don't know why, but I'm beating myself up a bit about being so trashy re-instigating our sex life. I'd pictured candles and romance. Instead I fell arse over tit in the bathroom afterwards and woke up craving greasy, greasy bacon. I feel a bit embarrassed and ashamed.

A TFMR that left me emotionally broken. The wild hormonal shifts of being pregnant and then not being pregnant. The fucking partial molar cloud that will follow me forever.

52,2048,confidence,<praw.reddit.Reddit object at 0x7f12a630cd90>,,ttcafterloss,"Hi all,  

You may remember me from [this post where I detail how life keeps throwing me spanners](https://www.reddit.com/r/ttcafterloss/comments/3v7osl/and_then_it_got_worse_so_much_worse_now_a_partial/). Well I had my follow up today after last Friday's Methotrexate.  

My HCG is 24, I have 3 more pathology slips for weekly blood draws. Hopefully it will zero out soon.  

The lack of bleeding is a good sign, still passing a bit of ""debris"" (grey tissue) in tiny streaks. My obgyn said that looking at my uterine lining from last week's scan, I should expect a very heavy period in the next week or two.  

He's hoping that when I'm re-scanned on 18/01/16 I'll get the all clear on AVM ... Here's hoping. Because that would mean surgery in Sydney and from what I hear, it's brutal.

But then ... he hits me with this beauty. The doctor in Sydney who he consulted with last week re the use of Methotrexate? He's the ""guru"" of hysteroscopies. My obgyn mentioned my subseptate and he immediately said ""oh we operate on those commonly now"".  

So ..... at January's scan, they're going to get good pictures of my uterus (my god damned fertility specialist in August said it was ""heart shaped"" and no one has had cause for concern since - and 6 doctors have now had a peek at it) to send to the guru in Sydney. Then he will determine whether it's best we have an appointment with him. And from there, whether to operate to correct it. Comes with risks, as all surgeries do, and it couldn't be done until AVM is ruled out / operated on and healed.  

It apparently can lower the risk of miscarriage though?

[tw- 2nd trimester loss]

We lost our little boy at 17 weeks about a month and a half ago. Weirdly, it seems like it happened a long time ago and just yesterday. He was our first after a year of ttc.

Everything was going fine. We had made our big fb announcement safely after 13 weeks and were so excited, even though we were cautious.

At 16+5 I had some increased discharge, like a little rush of fluid. I googled frantically (I know, not smart) and called my OB. After calming down and chocking it up to pregnancy being weird, I went about normal life.

A few days later I felt cold after spending a few hours outside. I couldn't shake it after some hot cocoa and couch snuggling, so I took my temp. 103. Another call to the OB and my principal to get a sub for the next day, just to make sure the baby was ok.

I miscarried that night at home. My amazing husband somehow got us to the hospital. He's some kind of superhero. Thank goodness for the nurses there who talked me through the rest of the process. One of them gave me a teddy bear, which I've since learned is normal. 

My OB team figured out my water must have broken at 16+5 which caused the miscarriage and a nasty infection. I ended up having to spend 5 days in the hospital on antibiotics. 

The day I got to go home was so happy! The leaves were the perfect shades of red and yellow and I just felt lucky to see it. What happened to us all sucks so badly. There aren't words and it shouldn't happen to anyone. But I felt comfort in knowing that once the lightning strike had happened, there was nothing I could do.

A month later I started to really feel like myself again. DH has continued his superhero ways. I had to deal with iron deficiency and what my OB called ""the yeast infection from hell,"" :) but he's been there the whole time. 

We are both so excited, so ready to start ttc again. We will always miss our little boy (in my head, oddly, I call him Bryson... I don't know where that came from!) but we feel confident that we will get to see him someday.

We've been together for close to 10 years and marriend about 1 1/2. We left for our honeymoon the day after our marriage and had a great time. Upon return my wife took a pregnancy test and it was positive..then negative...then positive. Many doctors appointments later we are told it's positive. A week later she began bleeding and we saw another doctor who had her rushed to the ER for emergency surgery. The pregnancy had gone ectopic and was causing some serious internal bleeding. She ended up having 1 of her Fallopian tubes removed. ...and life went on.
We weren't actively trying to have a kid but it happened, we were happy and then devastated. We both love the idea of having a child but agree we're not in the best financial position to do so but we would've made it work,I have no doubt.

Fast forward to now, we recently moved across country so we are alone in a new city , far away from family and friends and trying to make something for ourselves. 
Recently I came home from work and my wife informed me that once again, she was pregnant. I was again happy and terrified. She was too since the chance of ectopic pregnancies go up after the first one. A few days after she told me, she started seeing blood and feeling simalar symptoms to the first one. We ended up spending a day at the ER (no insurance as we had just moved and I had just started a new job). It was too early to tell but all signs were pointing towards another ectopic. At this point my wife was more concerned about saving her remaining Fallopian tube as this one seemed to be going ectopic again. We had a ton of DR visits with the nicest DR's on the planet who really bent over backwards to help us on the financial end of things since we did not have insurance. After a lot of trips to the DR's it was determined that it was in fact ectopic and she was given a shot to abort the pregnancy. HCG levels dropped appropriatly and the pregnancy was over. 
Yesterday we went for a checkup and the DR informed my wife that she has scarring on her remaining Fallopian tube and it is likely that she will not be able to have kids naturally, although a test is pending on this and we have to wait 3 months for it. But my wife is distraught, and already convinced that there is scarring, that she wont be able to have children and that IVF will be too expensive and that she is broken and she keeps apologizing. ...
..
..
I really don't know why I'm writing this. I feel empty. I feel terrible that I made her move away from her family and that no sooner than she was here this all happened and she has no support system. She doesn't want to talk to anybody in her family about it since she feels embarrassed by it all.

<p>We&#39;ve been together for close to 10 years and marriend about 1 1/2. We left for our honeymoon the day after our marriage and had a great time. Upon return my wife took a pregnancy test and it was positive..then negative...then positive. Many doctors appointments later we are told it&#39;s positive. A week later she began bleeding and we saw another doctor who had her rushed to the ER for emergency surgery. The pregnancy had gone ectopic and was causing some serious internal bleeding. She ended up having 1 of her Fallopian tubes removed. ...and life went on.
We weren&#39;t actively trying to have a kid but it happened, we were happy and then devastated. We both love the idea of having a child but agree we&#39;re not in the best financial position to do so but we would&#39;ve made it work,I have no doubt.</p>

<p>Fast forward to now, we recently moved across country so we are alone in a new city , far away from family and friends and trying to make something for ourselves. 
Recently I came home from work and my wife informed me that once again, she was pregnant. I was again happy and terrified. She was too since the chance of ectopic pregnancies go up after the first one. A few days after she told me, she started seeing blood and feeling simalar symptoms to the first one. We ended up spending a day at the ER (no insurance as we had just moved and I had just started a new job). It was too early to tell but all signs were pointing towards another ectopic. At this point my wife was more concerned about saving her remaining Fallopian tube as this one seemed to be going ectopic again. We had a ton of DR visits with the nicest DR&#39;s on the planet who really bent over backwards to help us on the financial end of things since we did not have insurance. After a lot of trips to the DR&#39;s it was determined that it was in fact ectopic and she was given a shot to abort the pregnancy. HCG levels dropped appropriatly and the pregnancy was over. 
Yesterday we went for a checkup and the DR informed my wife that she has scarring on her remaining Fallopian tube and it is likely that she will not be able to have kids naturally, although a test is pending on this and we have to wait 3 months for it. But my wife is distraught, and already convinced that there is scarring, that she wont be able to have children and that IVF will be too expensive and that she is broken and she keeps apologizing. ...
..
..
I really don&#39;t know why I&#39;m writing this. I feel empty. I feel terrible that I made her move away from her family and that no sooner than she was here this all happened and she has no support system. She doesn&#39;t want to talk to anybody in her family about it since she feels embarrassed by it all. I work long days, she works part time so she spend a good deal of time at home along in a strange place with 2 cats and a dog for company  . I feel like I could cry but I won&#39;t because I feel that one of us needs to keep it together and I know right now she is eaten up inside.

I went for a scan / follow up. The good = RPL bloods were fine. My uterine lining was 12mm and my ovarian follicle was gearing up to do its thing so a period will likely come in a few weeks ...

The bad? Pathology results from the second D&C (the one where they went in with a camera) showed a partial molar, which is why I *still* have retained tissue, and some HCG (62 as at Monday) ... They also discovered a mass of blood vessel activity next to the retained tissue which *might* be [Uterine Arteriovenous malfunction - AVM](http://radiopaedia.org/articles/uterine-arteriovenous-malformation) which is rare, but can occur after a miscarriage / D&C. 

Soooooo .... it can be life threatening if they try to re-operate, and instead I have to have a shot of a chemo drug (?? can't recall the name) soon to kill the last of the tissue, the **pray** that the blood vessels clear up and were there just because of the lingering tissue. 

I should get the chemo drug shot tomorrow. I should have a period by the end of the year and I'll be re-scanned in the early new year. If there's no AVM, I'm going to be ok to resume normal TTC. If there is, it's surgery in Sydney and a few more months waiting after that. They stressed that I must stay relatively close to a city / hospital over the holidays. And that I **must not** fall pregnant until AVM is ruled out as it would be very, very bad. 

Oh and my bicornurate uterus is actually subseptate, which made the ops hard ... 

I'm in shock, I'm broken. I want to quit everything I know in life and run away. Standard treatment for AVM used to be a hysterectomy. For child bearing women it's a softly, softly approach. At this stage I'm so numb and can't even care, take my womb. Maybe I'm not meant to be a mother. 

**UPDATE** : Thank you all *so much*.

It's done now after some confusion at the public hospital who weren't on the same page as my obgyn until they too had a scan / bloods. It was a long day. I think the doctor that administered it said I **cannot** TTC for a couple of months but the pamphlet on the drugs says three. Although that pamphlet relates to ectopic pregnancy so maybe my dose was lower? I see my obgyn for follow up Wednesday (more HCG testing Tuesday, today's was 37). 

I'm pretty gutted about being benched for so long. Praying I don't have an AVM now because surgery would count us out for longer and I ain't getting any younger. 

As /theotterisntworking said, the public hospital today mentioned non surgical treatment of AVM. So thanks for the heads up on that. They were talking progesterone treatment. 

Again. Thanks guys. I'm exhausted. But you all rock and are superstar supporters. It means so much to me. I hope it's ok to lurk here till we are back to TTC.

84,2048,confidence,<praw.reddit.Reddit object at 0x7f12a630cd90>,,ttcafterloss,"Hi ladies. I commented on a couple of thread yesterday after my blighted ovum diagnosis, and I posted in /r/miscarriage about what happened. In a nutshell, I had an early loss in October, and was diagnosed with a blighted ovum yesterday via ultrasound at 7w+5d. That empty circle was just awful to see. I saw it as soon as they put the wand in for the ultrasound. 

Anyway, I have a couple of questions. 

1. About the blighted ovum, are there any folks here who actually miscarried naturally? The doctor thinks I will but they took my HCG to see how high it is, and I stopped my progesterone supplements (given b/c of the loss in October). I'd like to avoid a D&C procedure since I have endometriosis and tend to scar internally like nobody's business. My body is really good at producing scar tissue, apparently. I'd also like to avoid continuing to be nauseous, constipated, having sore breasts and a damn tiny little bump making me feel like I'm still pregnant. I really want this to be over with. Anyone have a BO vacate naturally in a short time frame? 

2. I have a five-year old son, and since I've had two losses in quick succession, my mood is affecting him. I've got an appointment with my therapist, physical therapist, OB, and psychiatrist next week, so I'm trying to take care of the process of healing. And I'm giving the boy tons of attention and love. Still, he knows mom is really sad, and he saw me crying in the car on the way to school this morning. I'm wondering if I should tell his teacher what's up because he had a meltdown when I dropped him off this morning and didn't want to let me go. My heart almost broke in half. I told his teacher that we have a lot going on (I said that last week too, hoping I could tell her this week that we have a pregnancy going on and little dude will be a big brother, but no dice). 

I'm wondering if I should email her and let her know what's actually going on. I'm a bit of an over-sharer due to my open personality, so I don't naturally know the limits on what to share. His teacher is extremely compassionate and tuned into the kids, and I read a worried look on her face with what happened this AM. 

I was thinking of writing something like this. ""Hi Teacher ____. I said we had a lot going on, and I just wanted to clarify that everything is okay at our house. I have had two recent pregnancy losses, and I know it's affecting [Son's Name] because he knows Mom is sad."" 

Or hell, I don't really know how to continue that email. Fuck. But I know it's relevant since the kid has had a bit of trouble listening at school since the first loss. I'm not fishing for the teacher's sympathy, but I also want her to know what's going on with my kid. Should I email or leave it as is? 

TLDR: Ugh.

I had a MMC in June at 11 weeks (baby passed between 6-7); this was an unexpected but very much wanted pregnancy. I'm physically all clear and have had several cycles since, so on that front, I'm good to go whenever. I don't want to bring this up with my husband just yet, since I know he's ready to try again right now and I don't want to get his hopes up until I'm sure. 

I'm in the middle of a weight loss journey; I'm 31 lbs down from my starting weight, and would ideally like to lose another 19-20 before trying again (I don't want to get back up over 200 lbs during pregnancy, and 170 would put me in a position where I'd be pretty secure in that). Lately, however, I've been feeling a very strong desire to try again despite not being at an ideal weight. 

I know a lot of things are factoring in to this-- I am coming up on what would have been my due date (Dec 27th), I'm extra hormonal due to good old Lucifer's Waterfall, and I have a close friend whose due date is the same as mine would have been (so I'm seeing her constant Facebook updates, talking to her about it frequently, etc.) Furthermore, I'm in better shape now than I've been in since at least high school, I've got my lupus under control, I just ran my first 5K ever this past weekend, and I don't want to lose all the progress I've made toward my goal. I know it sounds kind of vain to think of it like that, but my head is a mess right now and I just don't know what to do. I am not sure whether my feelings are so strong only because of the reasons I mentioned, or whether I'm actually ready? I know there's never really a good time, but is it worth it to wait an indefinite amount of time to hit my goal? Would I be better off just trying to maintain through a pregnancy now, with moderate exercise and a good diet, and then just picking back up after? 

Arg. I got a little rambly there, I'm sorry; any advice anyone might have is greatly appreciated!",t2_5ma64,False,,0,False,Conflicted on wait time before trying again-- help?,[],r/ttcafterloss,False,0,,0,,,False,t3_3v0bul,False,dark,0.86,,public,5,0,{},,,False,[],,False,False,,{},,False,5,,False,self,False,,[],{},,,True,,1449013649.0,text,0,,,text,self.ttcafterloss,False,"<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=""md""><p>Hi all, I&#39;m having some conflicting feelings here, so I hope someone who&#39;s been in a similar situation can offer some guidance.

<p>I had a MMC in June at 11 weeks (baby passed between 6-7); this was an unexpected but very much wanted pregnancy. I&#39;m physically all clear and have had several cycles since, so on that front, I&#39;m good to go whenever.
