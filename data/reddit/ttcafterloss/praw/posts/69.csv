Thanks to u/skittlewig‚Äôs post, my husband and I had an awesome conversation about our miscarriages. We‚Äôve had 4 losses total, all early, from chemical pregnancy to 9w4d.

Though we are very happy with the practice we go to, the one thing we can‚Äôt get past is just how little resources there are for people going through miscarriage. We literally get told our babies are gone, here are the options for next steps, and that‚Äôs it ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è.

Only one time was I told that one of our hospitals has support groups, but in the midst of my grief, I lost the papers & didn‚Äôt really think about it again.

After each miscarriage diagnosis, I went straight to work. I worked through 1 of my miscarriages, travelled during one & took my youngest to a community activity during one, and took a half day to take cytotec during one. There was no space for grief, because no one told me it was ok to grieve. 

Any resources I did find were through my own internet search and usually through forums like reddit and baby center. And while I value that real person to person sharing, it would have been nice to not have to find it on my own.

So, what would have helped you during your losses?

Would it have been helpful if there was a resource kit they could give you- that includes local support groups, websites, remembrance ideas? Something tangible to help through your grief?  What if, like u/skittlewig does, they shared bereavement doula‚Äôs information with you? I just wish there was a deliberate action given to women & their partners during miscarriage.

My husband and I have had one successful pregnancy, a precious 2 1/2 year old who lights up our world. About a month after he was born, we got a card signed by his nursing team in the hospital.  I keep thinking, what if women who experience loss got a card month later honoring their loss? Something that says they are loved and not alone. 

I get 4 hours a month from my job to volunteer. I keep thinking there has to be something I can do to honor the pregnancy loss community, but I just can‚Äôt figure out what that is.

5,2048,confidence,<praw.reddit.Reddit object at 0x7f12a630cd90>,,ttcafterloss,"When I was 18 almost 19 weeks pregnant in December of 2015, we were told our baby might have spina bifida and were sent to a perinatologist for further screening. There, the perinatologist determines that our baby did NOT have spina bifida, but that the amniotic fluid was very, very low. She sent us to Children‚Äôs Hospital for more screening. Our appointment was a few days later. By that ultrasound, there was no fluid left. They told us that our baby would likely die, but wanted to do an MRI just to check a couple more things (determine whether or not it was PROM - premature rupture of membranes or if baby just didn‚Äôt have kidneys and/or a bladder). The MRI was two days later and the results came a few days after and determined that baby did in fact have kidneys and a bladder, but that at some point I had begun to leak fluid. 

They told us that we could remain pregnant, but that baby would die in utero due to infection and the weight of my organs would crush him (we didn‚Äôt know gender yet at this point though), or we could terminate the pregnancy. We talked and cried and cried and talked some more and ultimately decided on termination. We wanted to sleep on it though and wait until morning to call the doctor and schedule the termination. 

That night, I started cramping pretty badly. After a few hours, my husband made me call my primary OB. I hadn‚Äôt seen anyone in this office in weeks since I was being seen by specialists for the past two weeks, so they didn‚Äôt really know what was going on. I informed the on call midwife of my cramps and that our baby was dying and that we had decided on termination but hadn‚Äôt informed the doctor at Children‚Äôs yet, but that something was wrong. She was cold and rude. She said there was no way I could be in labor because I was only 20 weeks along. I explained to her that while I understood that, that something was wrong and I felt like I needed to be seen immediately. (This was overnight around 10pm). She said ‚ÄúWe just don‚Äôt have the resources for you here.‚Äù I began crying and she asked ‚ÄúWhy are you crying? Are you afraid of going into labor at home?‚Äù I said ‚ÄúYes, especially since I‚Äôm only 20 weeks along and a homebirth was never in my plans anyway.‚Äù She said (brace yourselves) ‚ÄúWell you can just squat and deliver in the toilet.‚Äù 

I understand that I was not full term, but she wanted me to deliver my baby in the toilet at home, and just what? Flush him? He was too big and developed for that. This crushed me. I hung up on her and continued to labor through the night. At about 9am, I called again and spoke with a different midwife who again told me they didn‚Äôt have the resources for me there. She wasn‚Äôt as awful though. At that point, my husband insisted that we call Children‚Äôs Hospital. They told me to get there immediately and that they had a room ready. 


The doctor there confirmed that I had in fact been in labor all night. My body had recognized that it was time to deliver. About 4.5 hours later, our beautiful baby boy, Knox was delivered vaginally weighing in at 8 oz. He had a heartbeat up until birth and died at birth since he didn‚Äôt have fully developed lungs. We spent the next four hours loving on him and soaking in the love he brought to our lives. Leaving the hospital that day was insanely difficult, knowing we would never see Knox again. 

The first year was the hardest, but six months in, I was lucky enough to attend a yoga bereavement retreat in Canada with other loss moms. It changed my life, as did losing Knox. 

I came home and a year later hosted my own yoga bereavement retreat here in Colorado (Boulder). It was even more healing to be able to provide that to other loss moms. 2 months after the retreat, I had a miscarriage at 7w5d. I felt devastated - like are you fucking kidding me? A loss after a loss? 

Fast forward to today. Knox‚Äôs 3rd birthday was Dec 22, 2018 ( a week ago tomorrow), and I am fortunate enough to finally have a rainbow baby boy, Jack, in our lives (4 months old). My grief has become a little more peaceful, but I‚Äôll always miss Knox. I was so angry that first year, and feel so thankful that I‚Äôm feeling more peace. 

I now host pregnancy and infant loss workshops here in Denver, would like to host another retreat next summer in Boulder, and host an Instagram page for loss moms. It‚Äôs set up so that a new loss mama (or papa) takes over the page each week telling their story in a safe tribe of loss parents. 

TLDR; My baby died at 20 weeks due to PROM, had a subsequent miscarriage at 7w4d, and now host pregnancy and infant loss retreats and workshops.

12,2048,confidence,<praw.reddit.Reddit object at 0x7f12a630cd90>,,ttcafterloss,"TW: LC mentioned

Hello everyone.  Happy to be here, but wish none of us were here.  Thought I'd tell my story, if only to get it off my chest.  I apologize for it's length.  For context, I'm 34, this was my second pregnancy, I have one LC, and I live in Ontario, Canada.

We conceived baby #2 on the first try, which was a surprise.  Baby #1 will be 2 in March.  Due date was early/mid may for #2.  Went in for a regular appointment on November 28th, and my doctor couldn't find a heartbeat with the Doppler, so she tried her little handheld ultrasound machine and she couldn't see a heartbeat there either.  She sent me over to the hospital for a ''real'' ultrasound, at this point my husband had left work to join me as we knew it was probably going to be bad news.  The blacked out monitor at the ultrasound only confirmed that news further.

Went back to the doctor, she confirmed the baby had died.  Based on measurements it was around 15/16 weeks old.  I'd been feeling movement for about 2 weeks already, or so I thought.  I couldn't help but think I'd done something that morning and that the baby had been alive until then.

The next morning I got a call from the hospital to come in and be induced.  My mom drove down to take care of our LC, as we didn't know how long it would take.  Went to the same L&D ward that we'd had our son at.  Same room type.  It was heartbreaking.  Got into a room around 9am, sat around and watched The Office on my husbands laptop all day.  Didn't see a doctor until six pm, I guess they got busy.  They started me with cervidil to dilate the cervix.  They checked me every 3 hours from that point and gave me another dose if needed.  I started cramping and being uncomfortable in the night so I asked for pain relief.  They gave me the good stuff.  I was in and out of sleeping and painkiller fog the rest of the night.  I tried to get up to pee at one point in the early morning and almost passed out.  Also vomited everywhere.  My BP was 70/40.  Guess I shouldn't have gotten up so fast.

More doses of cervidil, more The Office, more sleeping.  At around 2:30pm the day after we'd gone in I really had to pee again.  Got up, sat on toilet, peed, and felt the baby coming.  I was warned it could happen like this, and they'd put something into the toilet to collect the baby if it occurred.  Called in the doctor, they confirmed the baby had been delivered.  They cut the umbilical cord with me sitting on the toilet, after having me try to push to get the placenta out.  They took the baby away, we wanted to see it, but not in the toilet.

They gave me another dose cervidil to try to get my placenta to pass, but it didn't want to come out.

They brought in the baby for us to see.  It was a little boy.  He was small and red and we said we were so sorry to him.

I had been prepared that if the placenta didn't come out that I would need to have a D&C.  So off we went.  What was supposed to be a 6 minute surgery (I was under general anesthesia) turned into over an hour because I hemorrhaged and lost over a litre of blood.  My poor husband just sat in the waiting room with no answers wondering why I wasn't out yet.  I also lost a lot of blood leading up to the delivery, so they were pretty concerned with the blood loss and thought I may need a transfusion.  I didn't end up needing one.  I'm still feeling the effects of the blood loss over a month out.

I had to stay the night again to be monitored, we just wanted to get home and see our son.  I'm still nursing him, though only twice daily, and he had never been put to bed by anyone but myself or my husband before.  My mom said he was pretty good though.

I'd announced the pregnancy on Facebook on November 24th.  That made it even worse.  I ended up posting about the loss, and had so many people reach out to me with stories of their own losses or families losses.  It really helped.

SUPER LONG STORY COMING TO END

I found out yesterday that the baby showed some signs of my high blood pressure (controlled by medication, or so I thought).  He may have died because my placenta wasn't effectively transferring what he needed to him.  Everything else looked normal.  Still waiting on the full genetic testing.  We had the 12 week NT scan and bloodwork and everything was negative, so I doubt it was genetic.  Hurts to think that he died because of my blood pressure issues.  Will be talking to my doctor in the next few weeks about adding an additional medication to make sure it's controlled because we are already actively trying to conceive our rainbow baby.  I had a negative pregnancy test a week ago already, no period yet, but we figure why not try.

I‚Äôm trying so hard not to quit, but it‚Äôs all I want to do.

---- *OP*:

I've been in here for about a week. I deleted the account I used for my July Baby Bumpers group, but I had to create a new one to post here when I felt too overwhelmed and alone. 

My MMC was discovered at 10+4, a week ago yesterday even though it feels like 6 tedious months. A week ago yesterday we lost our future and realized how much love and energy we'd poured into our little nugget. We were going in for a dating ultrasound, but instead learned that baby hadn't grown in 2 to 3 weeks and there was no heartbeat. It was heartbreaking, embarrassing, and confusing. I started bawling during the transvaginal ultrasound while she continued to check my ovaries. It felt so much more real to lose our baby than it had felt when I was pregnant. My husband and I were both blindsided by the grief. 

The doctor around that evening (not my doctor) gave us some vague info, smiled altogether too much, and spoke about the ""products of conception."" I was not impressed but I was in no mood to be. He said we were on no timeline to make our decision on how to proceed. 

We went home, had my first gin and tonic in months, and alternated between crying, comforting each other, napping, and eating pizza for the rest of the day. 

Thankfully the next day I called my actual doctor and she was able to give me much more helpful information, more precise options, and a better idea of when we lost the baby, as well as a timeline. 

After reeling and crying and anger, the only way I could make my decision between D&C and misoprostol was cost, and potential complications with fertility. Misoprostol won out. With a plan, I could finally stop crying. 

The holidays meant that I had to stay frozen in a painful limbo until I had the opportunity to stay home. But today is finally the day. I'll be taking my miso soon and hopefully taking my first step forward in what feels like forever. I am terrified, but I am also so relieved. I think I will be able to begin the new year with a clean slate. 

And you guys -- I dont think I would be ready for today or would have learned everything I have about this awful process without you. Many people I know have had miscarriages, but no one I'm close with to talk to about it. I don't know how I would have made it through without you.

I'm 25 years old and have been with my boyfriend for 3 years. I miscarried last year at 3 months.. We weren't trying to get pregnant but it happened. We were happy, scared, hopeful... We told immediate family (moms, dads and siblings) about a week before my three month mark because I figured I was in the clear and to be completely honest it never crossed my mind that I would miscarry... I was naive enough to think that I was young and healthy and that it never happened to anyone in my family so it wouldn't happen to me. The night I miscarried was the most emotionally and physically painful experience of my entire life.. The doctor at the hospital told me it wouldn't hurt anymore than period cramps and I'm still so angry that he compared the pain of a miscarriage to a period. I was off week for a work and the placenta didn't leave my body until about 7 days after while I was in the middle of the mall trying to take my mind off things.

My boyfriend and I had planned on telling the entire family on Christmas Eve last year. I envisioned the entire night and I was SO unbelievable excited. But it didn't happen... Fast forward a year and this Christmas Eve my brother and sister in law announced their pregnancy. She is only 2 weeks pregnant. I hate to admit this but I am mad and resentful. I'm mad that the both of them knew that we were going to announced our pregnancy last Christmas Eve and neither of them thought to mention it to me or my boyfriend.... it would have been way easier to handle if I got a heads up. Im mad that everyone has just decided to pretend that what happened to me never happened. Everyone was poking me and saying ""you're next!!""...... I understand that it might be an uncomfortable situation for other people and maybe none of these people understand the hurt and devastation a miscarriage brings but I just thought that as a woman, my sister in law would be more thoughtful. I'm happy for them and I know this is such an exciting time for the both of them. But I would be lying if I didn't say that I was jealous, angry and hurt. Being in the middle of conversations about her early pregnancy symptoms, baby shower plans, gender reveals, possible names with the entire family - made me feel like I was going to throw up. It was so hard to fight back tears and put on a happy face for her. 

&#x200B;

Admitting that I am jealous makes me feel like a horrible person but its the truth... I just want to get past this. I have no friends or family who have suffered a miscarriage so I have no one to confide in who understands and I feel so alone. My boyfriend is incredibly supportive but I just feel like he cannot grasp my sadness.

&#x200B;

Am I a horrible person? How did you cope with you miscarriage? Is it normal to still cry over it a year later... I'm sorry for such a long post... I've let this bottle up for a long time.

<p>I&#39;m 25 years old and have been with my boyfriend for 3 years. I miscarried last year at 3 months.. We weren&#39;t trying to get pregnant but it happened. We were happy, scared, hopeful... We told immediate family (moms, dads and siblings) about a week before my three month mark because I figured I was in the clear and to be completely honest it never crossed my mind that I would miscarry... I was naive enough to think that I was young and healthy and that it never happened to anyone in my family so it wouldn&#39;t happen to me. The night I miscarried was the most emotionally and physically painful experience of my entire life.. The doctor at the hospital told me it wouldn&#39;t hurt anymore than period cramps and I&#39;m still so angry that he compared the pain of a miscarriage to a period. I was off week for a work and the placenta didn&#39;t leave my body until about 7 days after while I was in the middle of the mall trying to take my mind off things. </p>

I'm 28 and from the UK, and 6 weeks and 4 days post-miscarriage. I'm supposed to be 12 weeks pregnant today. I was going to tell my parents today.

My husband and I started trying again as soon as I started my period again. I ovulated four days ago (according to those sticks) and so now it's just a case of waiting for my period, which should be due next week. In the meantime, I'm finding it really hard. 

I told my parents while I was having a miscarriage and they we're trying again, and they were brilliant about it, but now they're being really strange.

I've been doing some reading on this sub about people who have used misoprostol and it's starting to freak me out. 

The D&C is much more expensive and I'm uncomfortable with the whole idea and the (unlikely) possibility of infertility, so I am really hoping to deal with this at home. 

My MMC was discovered at 10+4, and baby was measuring about 7 weeks. By the time I will be taking misoprostol, I will be 11+4, but idk if that matters.

It seems like people's experiences differ vastly based on how far along they were, and idk if that's based on what the baby was measuring or based on how long I've been ""pregnant."" 

Do you know what this is based on? Should I be panicking?

Please let me know if I need to edit at all. I hope it is not too long. I'm feeling sort of lost right now, I know you all can understand.

I was here in 2014 following a missed miscarriage that was discovered at 11 weeks (baby stopped growing at 9weeks). That ended in a D&C. I was 34 at the time. I found a lot of support in this group back then. It took an incredible emotional toll on me and we ended up waiting 5 months to try to conceive again. That first try 'worked' and I went on to have a healthy baby daughter the next year.

After 8 months of trying--charting, temping, OPK, etc.--I became pregnant again in August of this year. NIPT results came back low risk and we were very excited to welcome a baby boy in May 2019. My sister, who struggled for years with infertility, is pregnant, due in July and we were excited about planning for these two new cousins. My closest friend is also pregnant, due in June. It was a happy 4.5 months of pregnancy joy for the three of us. My daughter was so excited for her baby brother. He had a name, a Christmas stocking, presents under the tree, etc. At nearly 20 weeks I thought I was in the clear.

I have a home doppler and hadn't been able to find a heartbeat for the last three weeks. This, coupled with lack of moment had me a bit concerned, but people say the reason *not* to get a doppler is because if you don't find a heartbeat, you might get needlessly upset. So, I didn't let myself get too upset and chalked it up to a potentially anterior placenta. At my 20 week appointment last Thursday (I was 19+2), the doctor confirmed a lack of heartbeat and that the baby stopped growing at about 16.5 weeks.  Because of the holidays and the size of the baby, it was difficult to find a doctor who could perform a D & E. I desperately did not want to go through labor and delivery and was heartbroken to think I'd have to continue on through Christmas. My OB's office continued to call around and luckily, a clinic in DC took pity and fit me in yesterday. I spent the day there and got the D&E. I was awake through the procedure; maybe if people are interested I will write up about that experience. Maybe I will do it anyway to help with healing. I don't have to post it if it's uncomfortable for people.

So I realize I'm rambling. I'm so glad for this sub. I am hoping to find some hope here with you all. I turn 39 in March and am very concerned about my chances for another successful pregnancy. I'm also struggling with the holidays and I'm not sure how to get through them.

Again I am sorry for the length of this and I hope I didn't break any rules. Thank you for reading.

I've been talking with friends and family a lot about how being open regarding mental health can help with the stigma. Both mental health and fertility challenges are without blame, usually. Yet, there's still this quiet shame or fear surrounding miscarriages. I know that I did nothing wrong, yet I haven't opened up about my miscarriage publicly (on social media) and I carefully choose who to tell.

Here‚Äôs my story. I‚Äôm 32, dh is 33, and we started TTC in February of this year, after waiting longer than we wanted due to life stuff. I got pregnant in October and we were so happy. Then on Friday our NIPT results said there was a 30% chance the baby had trisomy 18. We were going to go in on Monday for a cvs to find out. Instead, I woke up Saturday morning with some bleeding so we went to the hospital. The dr took a look and said the bleeding wasn‚Äôt a miscarriage; that was a small relief, until we did the ultrasound.

Also, I realized I sound pretty judgmental in this post, I don't mean to judge anyone for their life choices, this is just directly impacting me.



First my introduction. 

My husband(33) and I(30) have been trying to have a baby since January 2017, almost two years. We we're thrilled to find out we were expecting in May of this year, right after we closed on our first home, it was perfect! Sadly, it didn't last and we had a MMC at the end of July, I should have been 11 weeks but our baby stopped growing at 9. I actually thought the morning sickness had passed  and was thankful.. I was able to pass the fetus, but did end up in the ER with the pain.

Both of our families were so supportive, some of them didn't know what to say and said some of the ""cardinal sins"" of things not to say to someone who lost their baby, but I had no doubt that it came from a loving place, and so brushed them off. 

My husband did the best he could to support me, but he just wasn't quite  attached to the baby as I was, which I can't blame him. For him, even though he was thrilled, he just had a sick/sleepy/excited wife for a few months. But my husband's aunt came forward and told me about her two losses and multiple years of trying as well, she got me through this.  Most days now are ok, but there's still not a day where our baby doesn't cross my mind, and the desire to be pregnant is overwhelming. I really hope that it doesn't take another year and a half.

After the miscarriage, I tracked HCG with at home pregnancy tests until they were that all to familiar stark white again. Then, on my next cycle, another positive! But it must have been a cp, because my period started late that night. I don't think I even processed this one, I did my best to delete it from memory. Two losses, back to back, I don't know.. I still haven't allowed myself to talk about it with anyone except my husband.

So here we are approaching the holidays, which I love and am so looking forward to! Now it's just shadowed by a bit of sadness as well, since I should be about to pop in 1-2 months. And instead, we're still trying.

The frustration..

My cousin(M,30) is a mess,he has anger/drinking issues, and has been married 3 times and divorced 2 times, and has had babies with all but the third one. As a side note, I offered to adopt his first baby. But they were ""so happy"" because his wife was told having a baby would be difficult. She also smoked/drank the entire pregnancy. He ended up divorcing her and leaving the baby boy with her, his poor life has been a mess that I won't get into on this post. He then immediately married his second wife (who was also told her chances to have babies were slim to none), and had two more babies. He stayed with this one for 3-4 years, but still they ended in divorce. Now he's married again and she refuses to have kids, so we'll see how that goes. FYI, He's military so if he remains unmarried, his paycheck is less.

The infuriating thing is, he is signing over custody/forfeiting all rights for all of his kids now, he doesn't want anything to do with them and doesn't care what happens to them..

How.. how does he get to have baby after baby with multiple women, and throw them all away.. and we can't have our own? I'm sure this is just a build up of the holidays, my nearing should-be due date, and my next cycle being due in 1-2 days, but I can't help but feel so hateful and spiteful towards him. I'll probably end up avoiding him at all costs at Christmas..

If you've read this insane rambling, thank you, I really appreciate you. Merry Christmas and happy holidays to all of you very lovely people.

TL;DR: TTC 2 years, 1 MMC 7/2018, 1 CP 9/2018. My dead beat cousin has 3 kids, and two baby mommas, and is forfeiting all rights to his children (one of which I offered to adopt, and was shot down).

I&#39;m sure this is just a build up of the holidays, my nearing should-be due date, and my next cycle being due in 1-2 days, but I can&#39;t help but feel so hateful and spiteful towards him. I&#39;ll probably end up avoiding him at all costs at Christmas..</p>

<p>If you&#39;ve read this insane rambling, thank you, I really appreciate you. Merry Christmas and happy holidays to all of you very lovely people.</p>

<p>TL;DR: TTC 2 years, 1 MMC 7/2018, 1 CP 9/2018. My dead beat cousin has 3 kids, and two baby mommas, and is forfeiting all rights to his children (one of which I offered to adopt, and was shot down). I am very sour. Also merry Christmas.</p>

I've unfortunately been part of this community for a while now, since I lost my first (and only) baby due to ectopic in October. I just need to vent a bit...

One of my best friends was 3 weeks ahead of me, and is having a healthy and happy pregnancy so far. I am still so genuinely happy for her and her husband even though we lost our baby, and cannot wait to meet their little babe. However, today she told me they are having a boy, and they are so excited. They desperately wanted a boy and found out today. All I could think was, ""Great, another thing goes perfectly for them."" All I wanted was one healthy baby, yet here they are blissfully ignorant to loss and ALSO getting the gender they wanted, which I never would have cared about with my baby, as long as it was healthy and alive. And it's not that I don't want them to be happy, I truly am so glad everything is going well, it's just that I thought I was going to be okay and clearly I'm not. We recently decided not to go to their new years party either, just because she will be showing then ( we dont live in the same town so dont see each other often) and I'm afraid it will trigger me. And clearly it probably will since just the amazing news of them having a boy did. I feel so guilty, and of course would never say anything, I just wish I was not having these feelings of jealousy (or anger? I don't know), because they are awful.

Nov 1, day after I expected my period to start, took another test‚Äî nope.  I figured I was out, my hormones were still self-regulating and that Sunday, mentioned how annoyed I was to my husband who said ‚Äúwell.. what if it isn‚Äôt coming?‚Äù.  That prompted me to take one more test that afternoon, which was positive.  We were so happy and shocked, although trying to be cautious since I know quite a few friends who have miscarried early on.  \n\nI immediately called my obgyn on Mon morning to book an ultrasound and also decided to go to a local health clinic to discuss a blood draw, since I have a form of anemia and wanted to check on whether I should be increasing iron or anything.  While there they took my HCG- 357- and confirmed it was about right for around 4 weeks.\n\nLess than a day later, early morning on Tues I wiped and there was a bit of pink.  I tried to reassure myself that might be normal, but I started brown-spotting more as the day went on, and by the evening it was bright red.  At that point I was feeling sad and told my husband I felt like I was miscarrying.  Thank goodness I had taken the test, though, because any other month I would‚Äôve just thought it was a slightly odd period.  Wednesday morning I kept bleeding bigger clots and started cramping on my left side, so I called the obgyn and they told me to come in for a scan and a blood draw that afternoon.  Nothing on the scan except for uterine lining (was less than 5 weeks at that point, but not even a sac), and HCG was 352.  \n\nI went for a follow-up blood draw Fri morning, assuming and processing that my body was miscarrying naturally since I was still bleeding.  Later that morning the nurse called and asked me to come in that afternoon‚Äî it had gone up to 478 and they mentioned possible ectopic.  I was in disbelief, but went in and the obgyn explained that with HCG rising between Wed and Fri and my symptoms (bleeding, cramping, nothing on ultrasound), she wanted to give me methotrexate to start treating for a possible ectopic.  They didn‚Äôt have Mon‚Äôs HCG level since that was a different clinic, but once I told her she was even more convinced.  At that point I hadn‚Äôt processed what was happening, but got the two shots with instructions to come back on day 4 and 7.\n\nWell, methotrexate was awful.  In addition to now being super anxious about the ectopic, being restricted to basically meat, dairy and white potatoes with a tiny bit of white rice and some lower folate fruit, it made me extremely tired with gastro symptoms, and the lowered immunity resulted in a cold that weekend.\n\nBy Monday night Nov 12, I was feeling a bit more pain esp in my shoulder (around a 5- not unbearable but I wasn‚Äôt sure how much pain I‚Äôd be in if it ruptured), so my husband and I went to the ER.  Another ultrasound, saw the corpus luteum cyst on my right ovary and a small amount of fluid in the pouch of Douglas.  Since I was supposed to go in for my 4 day draw Tues morning, they took my blood that evening anyway.  I was in a room close to the nurse‚Äôs station and overheard her gasp while getting my HCG results over the phone- 1417.   They expected an increase on day 4 but not that much.  After consultation with the obgyn on call and some talk of possible surgery that night, they decided to try another dose of methotrexate since I was generally stable, and to keep me overnight for observation.  I was fine, they released me and I anxiously waited for the Fri blood draw, now even more tired thanks to the second dose.  In between, my bleeding mostly stopped.\n\nFri morning Nov 16 I go to the lab at the hospital for the 7 day draw.  I have super small, deep veins so I‚Äôm a hard stick, and the guy tried twice with no luck.  Right after the second try while he was finding someone else to try, I started to black out, get super cold and sweaty (unusual for me, I‚Äôd never before fainted at a blood draw nor am I bothered by it).  As I was blacking out I told the lab tech that I had a suspected ectopic and might have to go to the ER, then don‚Äôt totally remember what happened.  I do know I was having a hard time fully regaining consciousness after 10 minutes, so they called for the ER and I got wheeled down the hall to get checked out, got another ultrasound and my blood drawn there.  Cyst smaller, less fluid and HCG now 1747- smaller increase so the obgyn thought we could wait till Monday blood draw.  Still no sign of anything else on ultrasound, and once I felt better from fainting I was released.\n\nSpent the weekend in high anxiety/grief mode (hyper vigilant about every feeling now) but hoping against hope that the rates were decreasing, even though I hadn‚Äôt bled for days.  Mon morning Nov 19 I decided I needed to try to feel normal so after my blood draw my coworker drove me to work (missed the entire last week due to fatigue and the cold).  \n\nEarly afternoon, I get a call from my obgyn office, and first thing the nurse says is ‚ÄúPlease stop eating or drinking immediately, come in as soon as you can‚Äù.  Crap.  HCG now at just under 2200, so it was clear the two doses of mtx didn‚Äôt work and I‚Äôd need surgery that night‚Äî but they hadn‚Äôt even found where the embryo was yet.  Thank goodness for my coworker, who saw me starting to bawl, drove me to the doctor right away and stayed with me until my husband came.  The office did another ultrasound, I told them I still thought it was on my left side given the pains, and they were finally able to find the embryo in my left tube.  \n\nIt was a weird feeling of overwhelming relief that they knew where it was and could do something about it, thankfulness that my tube hadn‚Äôt ruptured yet (although the bleeding/cramping restarted after the ultrasound and I came to find out after surgery I had started bleeding in the tube), and anxiety about the surgery (had never had anything more complex than wisdom teeth surgery before).  My obgyn did tell me pre-op that I would lose my tube as they generally remove it completely, and possibly my ovary.\n\nSurgery was thankfully uneventful except for the 4 sticks it took to get an IV in.  I lost my left tube but kept both my ovaries, the obgyn removed some adhesions (not clear on whether they were because of the ectopic or if they existed before), and said my right tube looked healthy.  Post-op, I had bleeding for about 3 days, my hcg dropped to 28 one week after and 3 the week after that. \n\nMy physical pain and scars are subsiding but the emotions and grief hit me hard this week, especially with the holidays coming up- I‚Äôd hoped we could announce to our families around Christmas.  I‚Äôm trying to take it one day at a time, counting the small victories when I start to feel more like myself each day, but giving myself the space to cry when I need to.  We still need to wait at least 3 months before trying again due to mtx, which is totally fine by me as I‚Äôm currently terrified of trying again right away. \n\nI‚Äôm curious about a couple of things:\n\nFirst period:  I‚Äôm waiting on my first period post surgery to come sometime in the next week, but will be traveling around that time too.  I‚Äôve read it could be crampier and heavier for some‚Äî what was it like for many of you?  \n\nHSG:  I‚Äôm debating whether to push for an HSG test for my remaining tube early next year.  I just thought it was weird that I ovulated from my right ovary but the embryo ended up on my left tube, so I‚Äôve been wondering if there‚Äôs something wrong with my right tube.  My obgyn thinks I‚Äôd be better off trying naturally for awhile (if it‚Äôs open, it‚Äôs fine, if it‚Äôs blocked I‚Äôd be treated for infertility anyway), but since I‚Äôm 33 already, I‚Äôm trying to decide whether I should just find out if the remaining tube is blocked and if so, skip straight to IVF.

Met with my OB to discuss the birth and go over any questions I had regarding that and subsequent pregnancies. He was very nice and invited me to come in to talk whenever I needed. Promised that my next pregnancy would be heavily monitored and after 20 weeks I‚Äôd have ultrasounds very frequently. In his words ‚Äúyou‚Äôll see me more often than your best friend!‚Äù.

The long and short of it is my placenta failed to properly implant and proceeded to throw a shit fit, probably once I got out of the first tri. I did not develop the preeclampsia and HELLPS symptoms until a week or so before delivery, once things reached a critical level with the placenta. He said their best theory is I was ‚Äúallergic‚Äù to the placenta, but having the same partner again can help mitigate risks of improper implantation. 

He was very firm that I could not have done anything and they had no way to detect the placenta wasn‚Äôt working, even if they had been able to there was nothing they could do. My son wouldn‚Äôt have survived either way, even if we had been at a hospital with a higher level NICU. If by some miracle he had, his chances of permanent physical and mental disabilities were over 80%. 

I am getting further testing to check that I don‚Äôt have a clotting disorder and he feels taking aspirin prior to conception would help mitigate some risks. I will, without exception, only ever deliver through c section due to my vertical uterine scarring. 

The bad news: he generally has people wait 9 months between delivery and subsequent pregnancy, but he would like if I waited a year. Great. So I have minimum another 6 months of sitting in the house mourning my loss and watching everyone else move on with their lives. If I wait that long I guess I can forget having a third child before I‚Äôm 30. What if I have trouble conceiving?? My husband and I were going to wait until April and maybe start NTNP then but that has in all likelihood been derailed. 

Worse news: I am looking at a 50% chance of preeclampsia again; no way to tell how severe it would be, but it‚Äôs usually less so. However he said since I was in the top 1% of severity, it makes everything ‚Äúless severe‚Äù. Chances of HELLPS recurring is around 20%. And there‚Äôs nothing that can be done to prevent it either, only try to manage symptoms and pray I am at an advanced enough gestation that my next baby doesn‚Äôt die too. 

To sum it up, I have to wait what feels like forever to become pregnant again. I will likely see a recurrence of at least one major complication - if this happens, there is the added potential of living, in the hospital, in a major city kilometres away from my home and family for an unknown period of time. Add that to the good chance of preterm delivery and a possible NICU stay; it all makes for a bad morning.

&#x200B;

I had an appointment with a new doctor yesterday.  The whole feel of the office was much different.  Everyone seemed to know that I wasn't another happy pregnant woman.  My initial appointment was with the NP.  I chatted with her for a while, explained why I was leaving the other doctor's office.  She kept apologizing for the other staff, and even went over old test results with me, she wanted to make sure that I knew what was going on, even if it doesn't have any effect on me now or in the future.  I was never told exactly how far along I was, so she went over that with me too.   She wasn't sure what kind of testing the doctor would order, if he would consider both miscarriages  as related, so she asked if I would like them to SQUEEZE ME IN to see the doctor that morning or if I would like a phone call.  SQUEEZE ME IN!... that day! That's something I never heard from my previous doctor.  It was always ""doctor can't see you until (insert far away date here).  

&#x200B;

The doctor explained that my miscarriages (18 weeks and 9 weeks) were unrelated, but I'm still considered high risk due to the late miscarriage.  (Life loves to fuck with me)  He does want us to wait a few months to start trying again. Which was our plan, I'm starting school in January and I'm in a wedding in March (that I would love to be able to drink at).  I'm like a kid though, once I was told that I can't do something, it makes me want it even more.  Even though I had decided I want to wait, now that we have to wait, I want to try nowwwwwwwww.   

&#x200B;

I left there feeling hopeful, listened to and comfortable.

Just looking to see if anyone has similar stories. We want a child very much but after learning we conceived easily the first time (to my SHOCK) and knowing how awful pregnancy was for me, we wanted to wait a few months at least. 

My d&c was November 7.  It was 8 weeks but measured 6.  I thought I tested out on cheapies by nov. 31. Figured not fertile. Had sex once on dec 2. On a whim took a test December 10. Faint positive. Took a million more. All faint positive, but didn‚Äôt get darker in the three days of testing.  My feelings at the positives were SHOCK. Then crying. I was not ready to be pregnant and feel awful and helpless and unable to do anything for myself again so soon. But also thrilled, because of course.

After three days of very faint positive but *definitely* there lines on 5 different brands of  pregnancy tests, my blood hcg is 3 and my progesterone is 0.7, which is not pregnant.

I feel very relieved and very sad and very foolish all at the same time and it is a very uncomfortable feeling. I prefer my feelings to happen one at a time.

The doctor is surprised I got these positive tests at all, but figures they are leftover hormones from the miscarriage. After my miscarriage, I stopped peeing on the cheap test strips when I got the first negative. So I guess probably if I had kept peeing on them, I might have seen very faint lines and negatives fluctuating for a bit longer. I guess? And the two FRERs i got lines on a couple days ago are probably because they can detect as little as 6.5 hcg, and if I was at 3 yesterday, that makes sense I suppose. It may theoretically be possible it was a super early chemical pregnancy but that seems highly unlikely.

I guess my hormonal crying yesterday was just normal emotional crying??

Good news is I feel productive with my Ritalin today and a Catzrgood who can do the things turns into a Happy Catzrgood pretty fast. I will be able to complete my Christmas tasks and enjoy them. Still have the sads and the feeling foolish though.

2-weeks later, at 10-weeks, I miscarried. 

I went in after the miscarriage completed itself for a follow up with my OB. It was not until then that they looked at my blood work I had done 2-weeks earlier and told me I had a severe thyroid disorder and that was likely what caused my miscarriage. 

I am now on thyroid hormone therapy and we are working to get my levels back online so we can try to conceive again. 

But, why didn‚Äôt my OB look at my test results back when I originally took the tests? Why wasn‚Äôt my disorder discovered then when my baby was still alive and had a confirmed, strong fetal heartbeat? If the thyroid hormone therapy had been started then, would my baby still be with me? 

Maybe it wouldn‚Äôt have made a difference. But could it have? Should my OB have been more on top of my test results at the time I took them, especially considering I was already diagnosed as high-risk?

Nine weeks ago I had a D&C on October 8th. October 24th I came back for my followup which felt very... brief? He sat me down, stuck a finger up there for less than 10 seconds and told me I was good to go.

Now I don't know what to expect because I had never been pregnant, or had a miscarriage before this. I had sort of expected an ultrasound to make sure everything was cleared out, or a blood test to check my HCG was falling or under 5. But the man with the degree didn't seem worried, so I shrugged down my worries and left.

It's now been 9 weeks since my D&C and about 5 weeks worth of negative FRER pregnancy tests. Each one is a little icepick to the heart. Combine that with my newborn nephew and the winter blues, and I could pretty much eat my weight in boozy ice cream. 

So I called the doctor today finally-- because I kept hoping one of those tests would be positive and I could schedule a new prenatal appointment, instead of a what-is-wrong-with-my-baby-maker appointment. 

I explained to the nurse that I hadn't menstruated or had any bleeding since the week of my D&C, and she called me back to tell me that my doctor had filed a prescription for Provera for me.

I kinda feel that maybe I should have at least had a blood test done first. Or an ultrasound to check on things. It feels a little bizarre to have a prescription written for me before those two things were done or I was seen again, but I'm not a doctor.

147,2048,confidence,<praw.reddit.Reddit object at 0x7f12a630cd90>,,ttcafterloss,"Hi everyone,

After months over at TFAB  I decided to join this community as I continue my TTC journey. 

I'm 28 years old, TTC for 5 months (though, from the looks of my charts, my timing was a little off for a few of them), and I am TTC as a single-by-choice mother after losing my son, Andrea, in 2013.

He was stillborn at 39+2, suspected meconium aspiration. He was born and died abroad (I was living and working in another country at the time). We scattered his ashes in a public garden in one of the capital cities of Southern Europe. I have a handmade blanket, a small slipper-shoe, and a book as artifacts, but not much else. The experience radically changed my world view, and I'd say even my personality to an extent. I started therapy right away (good life decision!) and continue going to this day. 

I actively avoided having another child in the years following Andrea, mostly because I was very focused on my career and my dating life was tepid at best. I'm still a career lady, and I live in one of the biggest metropolises in the USA with my two little dogs. I decided to take the plunge and have a baby on my own and am working with a known-donor (so, it's mostly regular ol' sex with a little bit of artificial at-home insemination).

While there's nothing in my journey to indicate that I'll have trouble conceiving (good test results, I'm pretty young, etc.) it often feels so out of reach for me. I can't imagine getting a BFP, having a baby, and having him live. 

I've found that ""real life"" people are remarkably uncomfortable talking about this type of loss, especially years later, and I tend to avoid it lest I receive a negative or inappropriate reaction (I've had many... to many to list).

Since beginning my TTC journey, I've had surgery to remove some polyps and am currently taking 4mg progesterone twice daily. And here's my [current chart](https://www.fertilityfriend.com/home/olive2490), in case anyone is interested.

I had a completely normal pregnancy, a normal 39 week checkup, and two days later I started what seemed like normal labor (I have a 2 year-old and a 3 year-old, no previous complications or losses, and this labor seemed exactly the same). My husband and I arrived at the hospital expecting to meet our 3rd and last baby within a few hours but instead the nurses and doctors couldn't find a heartbeat. We were completely blindsided and devastated. 

Less than 3 hours later I delivered a beautiful and seemingly perfect but sleeping 8lb 7oz baby girl. We declined an autopsy because I couldn't bear the thought of it, and her cord was wrapped extremely tightly around her neck two times. My doctor explained that the most likely scenario was that everything was fine leading up to labor, but when my contractions started and she began lowering, the cord tightened until she asphyxiated.

There are so many things that I could describe as ""the worst part"" of all this. I feel so much emptiness, anger, sadness, and jealousy. Everyone tells me how lucky I am to have my 2 older children (and they do bring me so much joy), but that doesn't mean I didn't want HER. That I didn't need HER. My SIL had a baby just a few days before mine was born, and being around them is such a devastating reminder of exactly what's missing. We're a close family, but the feelings of jealousy and anger are extremely difficult to deal with, especially during the holidays. They showed up for trick or treat with the baby wearing the same pumpkin hat I had bought for my daughter, but mine was of course still in the nursery closet, tag still on. My FIL has an annoying habit of plopping the baby unexpectedly into my lap, completely oblivious to the fact that it takes me hours to prepare myself to be able to hold any baby, much less the one that I so closely associate with the one that I lost. 

Despite how incredibly hard this has been, my husband and I decided we wanted to try again pretty much immediately. We were lucky to get pregnant in October after waiting two cycles. I had appropriately rising HCGs during week 4 and saw a strong heartbeat at 6.5 weeks. Then one morning around 8 weeks I started spotting. The next day an ultrasound revealed there was no heartbeat and the baby was measuring about a week behind. I had a d&c on 12/7.

I think we're going to wait at least a cycle or two before trying again. I'm looking at the urn containing my daughter and am just so sad that instead of holding a chubby and smiley 4 month-old, I'm mourning the loss of both her and what I thought was my rainbow baby.

Both in the aftermath of my stillbirth and now I am so grateful to everyone here who is willing to share the details of their experiences, both practical and emotional.

158,2048,confidence,<praw.reddit.Reddit object at 0x7f12a630cd90>,,ttcafterloss,"Hi All,

Just thought I'd share my hCG level decline. I shared as it was declining over in ectopicloss, but wanted to post here as I have finally reached 0 so my ectopic loss and methrotrexate journey is finally over. When I first started this journey I found it hard to find accurate info and real life experiences with methotrexate with positive outcomes, especially with hCG as high as mine when I first got the injections. There were many stories with it dragging on and levels not going down, etc. so I didn't know what my positive outcome could be. So hopefully this helps someone one day.

For my first pregnancy I was diagnosed with a left ovarian ectopic pregnancy on October 16th 2018 at 9 weeks pregnant, after some spotting for two weeks and tracking my hCG levels, which weren't going up appropriately. I listened to my body and advocated for myself, which got me the diagnosis before it ruptured.

My OB said once the methotrexate shots have been given, they consider a minimum 15% decrease each week to be acceptable. Usually if your levels are at 5000+ they don't recommend the MTX shot because there is less chance it will work. However, my doctor gave it to me at 9 weeks pregnant when my levels were in the 9000s.

Oct 16, 2018 (9 weeks pregnant) - 9000s (did not get exact number because it was in the ER). Received two shots of MTX

Oct 23, 2018- 4746

Oct 30, 2018- 1656

Nov 6, 2018 - 839

Nov 13, 2018 - 432

Nov 20, 2018 - 226

Nov 27, 2018 - 70

Dec 4, 2018 - 22

Dec 11, 2018 - 3 (Less than 5 is considered 0 or not pregnant)

So, that took a total of 8 weeks to go from 9000s down to 0. It was a long and tedious process, very painful emotionally, but now this gives closure to move on. I am genuinely happy that I can begin to take care of myself physically (Can start eating healthy foods with folate, and workout again) and prepare my body for the next time we start trying for a baby. 

If I can take away any positive from this experience, it is that I refuse to take my body for granted, and promise to nourish it with only good things (I really noticed how badly I felt these past two months not being able to eat anything healthy since almost everything has folic acid in it and not being able to workout). I also know I will not take pregnancy for granted, and will appreciate everything that comes my way. I yearn for the morning sickness, bloating, and everything else I was denied this pregnancy. I will appreciate all of it when I get pregnant with my next baby.

I listened to my body and advocated for myself, which got me the diagnosis before it ruptured.</p>

<p>My OB said once the methotrexate shots have been given, they consider a minimum 15% decrease each week to be acceptable. Usually if your levels are at 5000+ they don&#39;t recommend the MTX shot because there is less chance it will work. However, my doctor gave it to me at 9 weeks pregnant when my levels were in the 9000s.</p>

<p>Oct 16, 2018 (9 weeks pregnant) - 9000s (did not get exact number because it was in the ER). Received two shots of MTX</p>

<p>Oct 23, 2018- 4746</p>

<p>Oct 30, 2018- 1656</p>

<p>Nov 6, 2018 - 839</p>

<p>Nov 13, 2018 - 432</p>

<p>Nov 20, 2018 - 226</p>

<p>Nov 27, 2018 - 70</p>

<p>Dec 4, 2018 - 22</p>

<p>Dec 11, 2018 - 3 (Less than 5 is considered 0 or not pregnant)</p>

<p>So, that took a total of 8 weeks to go from 9000s down to 0. It was a long and tedious process, very painful emotionally, but now this gives closure to move on. I am genuinely happy that I can begin to take care of myself physically (Can start eating healthy foods with folate, and workout again) and prepare my body for the next time we start trying for a baby. </p>

<p>If I can take away any positive from this experience, it is that I refuse to take my body for granted, and promise to nourish it with only good things (I really noticed how badly I felt these past two months not being able to eat anything healthy since almost everything has folic acid in it and not being able to workout). I also know I will not take pregnancy for granted, and will appreciate everything that comes my way. I yearn for the morning sickness, bloating, and everything else I was denied this pregnancy. I will appreciate all of it when I get pregnant with my next baby. </p>

I'm a first time poster, so let me introduce myself and give some background on our story. My husband and I started TTC in August, and got pregnant on our first cycle! We were over the moon excited! We began planning for our first baby and thinking about all things pregnancy, birth, and nursery. That pregnancy, unfortunately, ended in a miscarriage. I started bleeding around 6 weeks, and my miscarriage was confirmed when I was 7 weeks by HCG quantitative testing. My levels were too low for how far along I was, and they kept dropping. Fortunately, my body passed everything naturally.

After our miscarriage, we called and told our families about the miscarriage. My MIL shared her experience with several miscarriages before successfully having my husband. She mentioned that when she was pregnant with his younger sister, she found out she had a Robertsonian Translocation (RT). She mentioned to us that my husband might also be a carrier. At first, I was upset, since she didn't tell us BEFORE we started TTC, but then I launched into research mode and began looking into RT and asked my OB's office to run the karyotype testing. 

We went to our hospital's lab and got 2 vials of blood drawn each, it was a very simple blood test. We got the results about a week later that my husband has a balanced Robertsonian Translocation on chromosomes 14 & 21. I was devastated by the news. All of the research I had done seemed to indicate high risk of miscarriage, high risk of a child being born with Down syndrome, and IVF with PGD seemed like the only option. My OB's office set us up with an appointment with the MFM Genetics team to discuss what our results mean and what our options are.

After an excruciating 6 week wait for our appointment, we finally met with the genetics counselor and high risk OB this week. It was really helpful for her to describe in detail what RT was and what our true odds are. Since my husband is the carrier, fortunately, our odds are better than if I was the carrier. **DISCLAIMER** While these odds may not be right for everyone in our situation, I figured posting it may help people, like me, who were searching for some answers before their follow-up with genetics. See a genetic counselor if you suspect you or your partner might have a translocation or other genetic issue.

If Male carrier of RT 14:21,
‚Ä¢ Odds of miscarriage are 33%
‚Ä¢ Odds of having a baby born with Down syndrome are 1%

The genetic specialist recommended us to continue trying naturally to get pregnant. She reports that in her experience, most couples in our situation go on to have a healthy child relatively quickly. She did discuss assisted reproduction options such as IVF with PGD as well as IUI with donor sperm. She said these are less common and most couples end up successfully conceiving naturally. 

This was a huge weight off of our shoulders. Our odds are still higher than average for miscarriage, but we are looking forward to trying for our rainbow baby after the holidays.

**Please note:** this may be a triggering post for some, so please note I will be mentioning our miscarriage and some if my experience.

We'd begun to see bleeding and cramping as of Sunday into Monday, and since we hadn't yet announced to family and friends, I was feeling very anxious and lonely and reached out to the community at /r/babybumps (who were so greatly supportive). Unfortunately, while we were hoping it would turn out benign, my symptoms escalated yesterday morning to the point I had horrific cramping and was passing massive clots - at one point every 10-15 minutes, filling up pads by the hour or sooner.

I knew it wasn't good when we went for ultrasounds and there was no mention of viability from the tech (although held out hope it was only because it was the doctor's role to do so). I knew just before they told us as, originally when the cramps got bad, I'd been given a low dose of morphine with reassurance that ""it wouldn't harm the baby"" and then hours later, they doubled my dose without a word of a baby or risk.

And then our doctor broke the news. There was no heartbeat. Our little ""snowman"", as we'd dubbed him/her from the adorable snowman shape on our sonogram where we heard their beautiful heartbeat for the first time, was gone. Later a nurse would ask first we were at 8 weeks and when we clarified 10, she mentioned apparently our baby didn't look like it had developed much past 8. This was horrendously sad news.

We're absolutely heartbroken. We do hope to continue to try as we feel ready, physically and emotionally. We were so ready to have our own little family, still ready in spirit to have our own little baby.

I'm already planning some tentative timelines for conception, but it's also so much waiting for my body to heal and see what unfolds. I can only try as my body allows me.

And even physically, I'm nervous for what this means for me. We got reassurance that this is common, that our loss doesn't mean we will continue to have problems ahead, but I would be lying if I wasn't nervous. Again, fresh off our loss, but it's still been traumatic and we won't easily push this aside.

I remain hopeful as we move into our new lives post-miscarriage, as we look towards trying again once we've healed enough in body and spirit.

<p>I remain hopeful as we move into our new lives post-miscarriage, as we look towards trying again once we&#39;ve healed enough in body and spirit. And I&#39;m grateful this community exists, because I have been nervous for what TTC means after losing our child. So thank you for being here.</p>

I had a D&C on Nov 19th, and just got the results from the genetic testing. Turns out my baby had Trisomy 22. Specifically the report says ‚Äú‚Ä¶the presence of Trisomy 22, which is the likely cause of intrauterine demise. There is no evidence of cytogenetic abnormality with a potentially increased risk of recurrence in future pregnancies‚Äù.  I‚Äôve read the second sentence a million times and I‚Äôm still not sure what it‚Äôs saying.  

Anyway, I think I‚Äôm relieved to have found a cause. I‚Äôm also horrified with my body for allowing this to happen. I had two CPs in the three months prior to this pregnancy, which I originally thought was caused by a small polyp. But now I‚Äôm seriously concerned about the quality of my eggs. I‚Äôm 35 and my boyfriend is 36 and I‚Äôm feeling a little defeated about it.

After reading ‚ÄòIt Starts With the Egg‚Äô I‚Äôve started on the typical supplement plan (Ubiquinol, etc) as we await our first RE appointment on Feb 14th.

I have a question to ask regarding my upcoming appt with a new OBGYN. I don‚Äôt even know if this is too soon to even consider since I will be new to the practice but I do know many people who were prescribed fertility meds through their office. No matter what I had to leave my former OB- I really feel that they mismanaged my care following my loss and on my last appointment I was told they wouldn‚Äôt/couldn‚Äôt assist with medicated cycles and referred to an RE I met with several years ago when I was first diagnosed with PCOS. I was told by the Dr I would never get pregnant naturally and need IVF to ever conceive- two pregnancy‚Äôs later (1 birth,1 MC) I don‚Äôt fully trust his advice. 

I will give a little more clinical background on my MMC/D&C (to the best of my ability/knowledge). 

MMC diagnosed in July at 11 weeks - baby stopped growing around 9 weeks. D&C July 27th, bled from the 7/27 until 8/16.

I‚Äôm assuming that the bleeding in November was not a period therefore my last cycle was 50 days. 

I‚Äôm going to meet with a new ob on 12/13 (cd5). I want to discuss starting clomid or letrozole ASAP. 

Does anyone have any advice on what I should ask/say to the doctor? And what should I expect her to prescribe/suggest? I‚Äôm assuming she may refer me to an RE- I‚Äôm just feeling so impatient and need a timeframe for when I should be able to start a medicated cycle.
