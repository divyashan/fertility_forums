I've consulted with the head mod of /r/babybumps and she has kindly consented for us to put together a post about loss etiquette to be posted in and added to the wiki of the sub.

The aim of this is to educate people on the appropriate and inappropriate things to say to someone who has had a baby die. There's sadly a lot of things being said to loss parents when they announce their sad news on the sub that is causing a lot of extra upset and hurt to grieving parents, and we feel it would benefit everyone to have a post to refer to so that people can be a bit more understanding and reflect on their words before commenting on a loss announcement. 

What I'm looking for: 

•people who want to help brainstorm exactly how we are going to present this information and help structure our post.

•people who are willing to share their experiences of helpful words and advice following loss - we may quote real users if you consent

•people who are willing to share their experiences of words or advice that were hurtful or generally not helpful or appropriate following loss - we may quote real users if you consent

•words of advice as a loss parent to someone who is looking to support someone else through a loss

I liked him pretty well and will probably move over to him permanently. The procedure hurt like a mother effing bitch. I was not at all scared because I'd read it was quick and like a severe cramp. NO. It felt like I was getting 3 IUDs inserted. I said ""shit"" like 10 times. He said when he first inserted the catheter and blew up the balloon that it fell out - THEN asked me if I'd only had the two miscarriages....I *think* implying I was loose for never giving birth...LOL. So he said he blew it up really big and was sorry, and doing that did make it hurt more. 

I truly, honestly felt that everything was going to be all clear with this HSG. I never thought I'd have a blockage or anything else wrong and this would be the end of the road as far as procedures go. We had a plan to NTNP for three months. Nope. HSG revealed an ""intrauterine mass"" or ""polyp"" - he used both words. He said I need surgery to remove it, especially with having two miscarriages and that a pregnancy could attach on or near it and it could suck the blood supply from it. THEN, he showed me that near the end of one tube, where they want the dye to spill out, it didn't spill out as much as he'd like. I could clearly see the dye go everywhere on the left tube, but on the right, it kind of pooled in one area. He asked if I had pain, and I said no. He said there may be adhesions or scarring or something there and it might be something to look at with laparoscopy, but he wasn't sure. He said my tubes looked perfect though. I asked if I should not have sex and try - he said to go ahead and there's no reason not to. So yeah, I'm comfortable just chancing that and hoping a pregnancy doesn't attach to the mass that's sitting in my uterus - NO WORRIES. Ugh. 

Guys - what the fuck now? Calling all polyp removal AND laparoscopy recipients - what can I expect and how long until we can TTC?

I've had two miscarriages this year, one at the end of April and one beginning of July, both right around 5-6 weeks. We are in our mid 30's and are pretty healthy. 

With the first, I miscarried the day after a positive test so it all happened very quickly. With the second I had some light bleeding and got in for an ultrasound the next day, saw what would have been our baby on the ultrasound, and miscarried the next day. 

My doctor has said that they generally do not do any special testing until 3 miscarriages. She said it was possible, although uncommon, that I may have antiphospholipid syndrome and could do a blood test for that. First result, even if positive, is not always accurate, so you need to do the second test 12 weeks later. Treatment for this is apparently aspirin during the pregnancy. I have not done this testing yet. 

I was told that with my next positive test they will start treating me with progesterone (apparently controversial because it doesn't prove to make a difference, but doesn't do anything bad) and will do hcg levels more regularly to ensure they are going up.

We decided to keep trying and are hoping for a positive test soon. My knowledge that this is common, and that some people have many before having a successful pregnancy, is keeping me relatively sane so far. However, while I'd love to proceed with the thought that this next time it will work, I can't shake the feeling that it's not going to.

Hey ladies, I thought that I would finally formally introduce myself over here. I couldn't bring myself to introduce until we were actually trying again but now that we are I'm sure I'll be more active.

A little about me. I'm 29 and was diagnosed with PCOS when I was 17 and the doctor at the time told me that I would no be able to get pregnant without fertility treatment. No doctor that I have had after him agrees with that statement. I had 28 day cycles which made them all hopeful; one said maybe one day I might need clomid but we'll cross that bridge when we get there.

Well, DH and I decided to start trying after we got back after a big vacation. So I took my last pill at the end of June and CD1 was July 1 and then the tracking began. I love data, so temps, OPK and saliva microscope were all acquired. I had major symptoms during my TWW, but because it was the first off BCPs I had no idea if they meant anything. Then I got my ""period"" with a 27 day cycle. It was light and lasted for about 5 days with spotting.

Well, on what I thought was CD9 I woke up to get ready for work and knew that something wasn't right. There was one spot of rust colored blood on my underwear. I got ready for work, threw on a liner and grabbed a cheapie pregnancy test and a cup to pee into and brought it to work with me. I figured I can take the test get a negative and then tell my body to get it's shit together.I only did a two hour hold, but I hadn't had anything to drink that morning yet. I dipped that test and it was blazing positive immediately. 

I got a doctors appointment for the next day, and when I got home from work I told DH. He said he was not surprised and that I had been glowing all week. The happy was short lived because when I went for my appointment my uterus was empty and my HCG level was too low for 5 weeks that I should have been. 

We took August off on the doctors recommendation and we are now back to trying. I'm on CD11 and we're giving it our best shot this month. I'm hopeful but not optimistic.

Its not fair, and it pisses me off. To be completely honest I am getting better, I think this D&C today is really a stepping point to know that I actually can move on and try again soon, but right now I dislike all pregnant women, is this just my only child mentality where I want what I want and I'm mad when others have what I don't?

46,2048,confidence,<praw.reddit.Reddit object at 0x7f12a630cd90>,,ttcafterloss,"Hi, ladies!

As I posted [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/ttcafterloss/comments/4qtriw/experiences_with_misoprostol/), I had an MC about 8 weeks into my pregnancy back in July. I ended up having a D&E at the end of July after two rounds of misoprostol failed to do the job. 

My period returned last month, about which I was SUPER relieved. I was worrying and worrying that it would take at least three months to start up again, and the inexorable passing of each day was freaking my biological clock the fuck out. My kids were supposed to be less than three years apart!!!! What if they're more than FOUR years apart? LIFE WILL BE RUINED FOREVER. 

However, AF made her appearance near the end of August, and according to my period-tracking app, I should ovulate around tomorrow or so. OPKs to date have been negative, and my CM seems awfully sticky, though. 

We started trying on the first day of my ""fertile window"", and I've been using PreSeed to help the spermies get to where they need to be. I hadn't realized that PS is pretty much only useful for people who have shitty CM, but once I figured that out from some PS AMA, I was pretty glad I had decided to use it this week! 

I can't tell if my cycle is just kind of wacky post-MC and ovulation is just going to be a bit late, or if it's completely wacky and I'm not destined to ovulate any time soon. Ugh.

<p>As I posted <a href=""http://www.reddit.com/r/ttcafterloss/comments/4qtriw/experiences_with_misoprostol/"">here</a>, I had an MC about 8 weeks into my pregnancy back in July. I ended up having a D&amp;E at the end of July after two rounds of misoprostol failed to do the job. </p>

<p>My period returned last month, about which I was SUPER relieved. I was worrying and worrying that it would take at least three months to start up again, and the inexorable passing of each day was freaking my biological clock the fuck out. My kids were supposed to be less than three years apart!!!! What if they&#39;re more than FOUR years apart? LIFE WILL BE RUINED FOREVER. </p>

<p>However, AF made her appearance near the end of August, and according to my period-tracking app, I should ovulate around tomorrow or so. OPKs to date have been negative, and my CM seems awfully sticky, though. </p>

<p>We started trying on the first day of my &quot;fertile window&quot;, and I&#39;ve been using PreSeed to help the spermies get to where they need to be. I hadn&#39;t realized that PS is pretty much only useful for people who have shitty CM, but once I figured that out from some PS AMA, I was pretty glad I had decided to use it this week! </p>

<p>I can&#39;t tell if my cycle is just kind of wacky post-MC and ovulation is just going to be a bit late, or if it&#39;s completely wacky and I&#39;m not destined to ovulate any time soon. Ugh. What a pain in the butt this all is - especially factoring in a husband with so-so libido and trying to BD around the unschedule of our toddler. </p>

<p>No questions, really - I just felt like sharing all of this with people who would understand and wouldn&#39;t mind knowing about my cervical mucus (it&#39;s crazy how my sisters don&#39;t want to know all about it!) and ovulation cycles and how much sex I&#39;m having (we&#39;ve managed four successful times in the past five days).

I would really appreciate some feedback from others who have had a D&C or gone the chemical route . What was the recovery like? Was it painful?

I had a checkup with my obgyn today (I am in Germany, if it's relevant.) She was happy that my body seems to be doing everything it should, bleeding has stopped, HCG is down to 9.7 (yesterday) and there's nothing left in my uterus, so there are no concerns.

Now she wants me to come back in 3-4 weeks for more bloods (OK, fine) and to not try to conceive again until I've had two normal periods. I tried to ask why and she just said it's for the security of the next pregnancy. That says to me that there's no real reason, she just for some reason feels like it would be better?

I just feel like it's such a time suck every time we miscarry because that takes an entire cycle and a half out, and to have to wait an extra month, or two, on top seems ridiculous. I'm not running out of time, we are only 28, but I already have an almost 8 year old, and the gap is getting larger all the time. We've been TTC since March so it's frustrating to not have a viable pregnancy yet, and I don't see a point in waiting around.

I wonder if she's concerned for my mental wellbeing since I feel so pragmatic about the whole thing and am not coming in really distraught or anything? It just feels frustrating. Everything I read about miscarriage says there is no reason to wait to try except that it makes it more difficult to date a pregnancy.

Does anyone have any advice? I am going to speak to my husband and see what he thinks - last time he was like ""Why don't we just NTNP during the first month after"" and I think I'd be down for that again, but aargh.

She was happy that my body seems to be doing everything it should, bleeding has stopped, HCG is down to 9.7 (yesterday) and there&#39;s nothing left in my uterus, so there are no concerns.</p>

<p>Now she wants me to come back in 3-4 weeks for more bloods (OK, fine) and to not try to conceive again until I&#39;ve had two normal periods. I tried to ask why and she just said it&#39;s for the security of the next pregnancy. That says to me that there&#39;s no real reason, she just for some reason feels like it would be better?</p>

<p>I just feel like it&#39;s such a time suck every time we miscarry because that takes an entire cycle and a half out, and to have to wait an extra month, or two, on top seems ridiculous. I&#39;m not running out of time, we are only 28, but I already have an almost 8 year old, and the gap is getting larger all the time. We&#39;ve been TTC since March so it&#39;s frustrating to not have a viable pregnancy yet, and I don&#39;t see a point in waiting around.</p>

<p>I wonder if she&#39;s concerned for my mental wellbeing since I feel so pragmatic about the whole thing and am not coming in really distraught or anything? It just feels frustrating. Everything I read about miscarriage says there is no reason to wait to try except that it makes it more difficult to date a pregnancy.</p>

<p>Does anyone have any advice? I am going to speak to my husband and see what he thinks - last time he was like &quot;Why don&#39;t we just NTNP during the first month after&quot; and I think I&#39;d be down for that again, but aargh. Plus I&#39;m kind of half expecting a lecture now if I <em>do</em> show up pregnant before November!</p>

I hate to be part of the club of those have lost a pregnancy but unfortunately I joined in June with a MMC at 11weeks. I posted a similar post to TTC30 and just wanted to become a part of a supportive and necessary community for those that have endured similar things as myself. I have been a reader on here since my loss and am in awe with the support you offer one another and how incredibly strong you all are.

I have fortunately had the opportunity to carry a baby earlier this year. Unfortunately at 9 weeks we found out that it had a rare disorder (likely Turners Syndrome) with a serious heart defect and that the pregnancy wasn't viable. This was my first pregnancy and a fluke that we even conceived. At the time we weren't actively trying for children and we made a choice one night to not use a condom and I was so fortunate to have timed it perfectly and it stuck. At week 11 we found out she had died, and I proceeded with a D and C as it was a missed miscarriage at 12 weeks. 
My D and C was in June and I had my first real AF August 1st. (That day my partner also proposed so I guess it was not only a disappointing day but also a pretty good one). 

I am 29 nearing 30, a type one diabetic, negative blood type and have been informed I may be a carrier for sickle cell disease (but then on second and third opinions was told probably not).

Mainly I am here to offer support to others that have had devastating pregnancies, or devastation just in the process of trying to conceive. Today marks my second AF post miscarriage and I really thought it had stuck. I was 7 days late, or so I thought, we had been actively trying this cycle and today I realized that I am likely on a 35 day cycle and will have to just keep that in mind for the next round. 

It has been a disappointing few months for me and as much as my first pregnancy was not planned it was not unwanted. Now that we have had the chance to be parents both my partner and I are desperate to try and conceive again. 

Thank you for reading (my novel) and I hate to be a part of the club but after reading how supportive and incredible you all are towards each other over the past 3 months, I couldn't be more grateful to know there are others that get it and care. Thank you for all your kind words to one another they have helped me through what I never expected to be a part of my story and I have found comfort in knowing there are really strangers out there who understand and support one another.

But then I remembered that these are people who I normally really like. And no one is trying to be mean. How can they be sensitive to what they don't know?

So I sat there and took a deep breath. I made it my goal not to sound pissy or judged. I just quietly told them. I said, ""well to tell you the truth we've been trying since March.

We first made the decision to try in November 2014 and have been on again/off again trying since - diagnosed with PCOS and wondered what the point was for a few months, put too much pressure on ourselves, etc - before having positive test in early June while using Metformin/Provera/Clomid. The feelings that came up that day and after were indescribable. Had our first OB appt and learned I probably ovulated later than we thought, she guessed I was around 4-5 weeks and even thought she saw a second sac. We had our minds blown for the next week when we went back for another u/s and she said it's not growing as fast as it should but don't be alarmed. Went back the next week and she said still no heart beat and HCG levels in blood test were going down. She gave me time to consider passing naturally, ultimately had D&C 7/15/6 (the day after the worst birthday I've ever had!) and I've been trying to grieve ever since. I learned a few weeks after the procedure that my SIL told my mom the day of that she was pregnant with their 3rd (my parents are the only family members who knew). I was crushed. I later learned they miscarried but we're very distant and haven't discussed. 

We didn't tell many people and I still have mixed feelings about that - it's utterly isolating but I'm also glad I don't have to constantly talk about it with others.  There are so many assumptions and judgements about ttc and loss. I'm also super frustrated because we were 'in a really good place' right before testing positive. I was accepting that it wouldn't happen on my own timing, my husband and I were closer than ever, and life just seemed to be going well. It's challenging to try to put the pieces back together now. 

We're trying to decide what the right timing is for us to start trying again. My OB  recommend I do Provera since I haven't had a period since then. I started spotting today and would usually start Clomid cd5-9. We're talking about it but I think we've agreed I'm going to give myself the grace to see how I feel about things on day 5 and try not to pressure myself (that's not an easy thing to do!). 

Things I've learned while working on the process of acceptance:
-Things don't happen on your time - you don't decide to try and become pregnant the next week.
-Stay hopeful. Hope gets you through. Mentally I was preparing myself for anything possible but I think I would have been more crushed without hope.
-Someone voiced concern I may not have 'closure' with a d&c like I would naturally miscarrying. That day was one of the worst. When they ask how far along you 'were,' how to handle the remains, and regularly say 'I'm sorry for your loss' (first time we'd heard it), the door of closure keeps slamming in your face. 
-Women must talk about this more. This has been one of the most isolating, despairing, shameful experiences I've ever been through. When the time is right, I'll open up with more friends/family. If we conceive again, I think I want to celebrate any part of that new life as early and long as possible. 
-Baby Center, Facebook, Enfamil (who knows who sold them my info), the freaking insurance company... They don't know you had a loss and want to slap reminders in your face regularly. Deactivate that shit!

77,2048,confidence,<praw.reddit.Reddit object at 0x7f12a630cd90>,,ttcafterloss,"Well, I guess this is where I belong now.

We are currently trying to survive a missed miscarriage. It was our first pregnancy, conceived during our honeymoon after only three months of trying. We were over the moon! 8 week scan looked good with a strong heartbeat and some on-screen wiggles, and we more or less stopped worrying so much. After all, the doctor said we were essentially good to go after such a good scan so early.

12 week scan came. The baby measured only 11 weeks and had no heartbeat. We had no clue. That was last week Wednesday and I finally started spotting on Saturday. The bleeding slowly increased over Sunday, Monday, Tuesday...finally Wednesday morning I went into labor. 9 hours later, the doctor said my cervix wasn't dilating at all and I needed a D&C. Unbeknownst to us, in the time it took them to get the OR set up and all of that, my cervix did in fact start to dilate, but we didn't learn that until I was already under. The OB told my husband it probably would have taken it several more hours at that rate anyway and that the cervix dilating made the procedure easier, so I guess that's good? I'm mostly glad to know my body did eventually start to respond the way it's supposed to...

The remains are at pathology right now but we should get to bury her at the end of next week sometime. Chances are we'll bury her on or at least somewhere very near my 30th birthday on September 11th. (No, we technically don't know if it was a girl or not, but my husband and I both had a strong gut feeling she was going to be a girl and it feels better than saying ""the baby"" or, worse, ""it"" for the rest of our lives.) The doctors seemed to think it was a little...odd, for us to be so adamant that we want to bury her, to the point where I was even fighting against getting the D&C at all until they could assure me that we would still get the remains in the end, but it means the world to us and I'm so, so, so glad I insisted on it even through everything. 

At this point, honestly, I'm partly missing her terribly and feeling more empty than ever and crying more than I did the entire week leading up to this...and I'm partly thankful her body is out and we can start processing the next steps. We felt very...stuck, just sitting and crying and waiting for that week between the ultrasound and the D&C.

<p>We are currently trying to survive a missed miscarriage. It was our first pregnancy, conceived during our honeymoon after only three months of trying. We were over the moon! 8 week scan looked good with a strong heartbeat and some on-screen wiggles, and we more or less stopped worrying so much. After all, the doctor said we were essentially good to go after such a good scan so early.</p>

<p>12 week scan came. The baby measured only 11 weeks and had no heartbeat. We had no clue. That was last week Wednesday and I finally started spotting on Saturday. The bleeding slowly increased over Sunday, Monday, Tuesday...finally Wednesday morning I went into labor. 9 hours later, the doctor said my cervix wasn&#39;t dilating at all and I needed a D&amp;C. Unbeknownst to us, in the time it took them to get the OR set up and all of that, my cervix did in fact start to dilate, but we didn&#39;t learn that until I was already under. The OB told my husband it probably would have taken it several more hours at that rate anyway and that the cervix dilating made the procedure easier, so I guess that&#39;s good? I&#39;m mostly glad to know my body did eventually start to respond the way it&#39;s supposed to...</p>

<p>The remains are at pathology right now but we should get to bury her at the end of next week sometime. Chances are we&#39;ll bury her on or at least somewhere very near my 30th birthday on September 11th. (No, we technically don&#39;t know if it was a girl or not, but my husband and I both had a strong gut feeling she was going to be a girl and it feels better than saying &quot;the baby&quot; or, worse, &quot;it&quot; for the rest of our lives.) The doctors seemed to think it was a little...odd, for us to be so adamant that we want to bury her, to the point where I was even fighting against getting the D&amp;C at all until they could assure me that we would still get the remains in the end, but it means the world to us and I&#39;m so, so, so glad I insisted on it even through everything. </p>

<p>At this point, honestly, I&#39;m partly missing her terribly and feeling more empty than ever and crying more than I did the entire week leading up to this...and I&#39;m partly thankful her body is out and we can start processing the next steps. We felt very...stuck, just sitting and crying and waiting for that week between the ultrasound and the D&amp;C. A burial isn&#39;t exactly the baby plans we wanted to make, but being able to do <em>something</em> is a help. I&#39;m going to make a tiny baby quilt for the bottom of the coffin and my husband has taken on organizing everything with the cemetery. If nothing else, it helps distract me from how incredibly quiet and empty the apartment feels now.</p>

On August 12 I called my OB office slightly concerned because I hadn’t felt my baby move in a few days.  I was 24 weeks with an anterior placenta, they didn’t seem very concerned.   They got me in and put a Doppler on my stomach, told me they could hear the baby’s heartbeat and to not worry about counting kicks until I was 28 weeks.  I wish SO hard that I could go back in time to that day, to tell them to do an ultrasound or a stress test or anything to take me more seriously.  My baby girl was alive that day, and I felt a couple kicks the next day, but that was it.  I told myself it was all my placenta’s fault and not to stress.

I had a regularly scheduled appointment on August 19.  I told them about the lack of movement, but again they didn’t seem too concerned.  The physician finally said “well as long as you feel a little something every day” and that’s when my heart began to race.  I hadn’t felt movement in days.  She did a Doppler check and told me that she heard a heartbeat but said “Let’s do an ultrasound just to make you feel better.”  The ultrasound tech laid me down and initially was cheery but quickly got quiet.  I noticed the baby wasn’t moving at all, I couldn’t see her heart fluttering like it had just 5 weeks before at her anatomy scan.  The tech said the words no one wants to hear “I’m so sorry” and after that I went into shock and just bawled for an hour until my husband could get there.  

We went to the hospital and got a second ultrasound, but it just confirmed the first.  They put me on an IV and gave me my first dose of Cytotec at 9 pm.  Nothing happened for a long time.  I was given more Cytotec every 6 hours.  My mom came from 2 hours away and I’m so glad she was there for me and my husband; I was pretty out of it and so he had to do most of the talking to nurses and doctors.  24 hours  and 4 doses later he spoke with the doctor about his concern that things weren’t progressing, and they quadrupled my dose.  Finally at 12:30 am on August 21 my contractions started.  I got an epidural and at 2:30 my water finally broke.  My baby girl Riley Elizabeth was stillborn at 3:06 am.  I had held out some tiny sliver of hope that they were wrong, that I would hear a cry when she came, but of course that didn’t happen and it broke me over again.  

My husband, my mom and I all took turns holding her for a few hours.  We took pictures, which felt wrong at the time but now I am so glad we did.  She was perfect.  10 tiny fingers and toes, blonde fuzz on top of her head, nothing to tell us why she passed.  We still don’t know.  The doctors suspect a cord accident, but there was no definite proof other than my placenta was functioning fine but she had no blood moving through her.  

It’s been a little over a week and we’re home now, in the big empty house we bought after learning we were pregnant.  I can’t fucking function, waking up each day hurts all over again.  Everything I see around me is a painful reminder she’s gone.  I don’t have motivation to do anything.  It’s a good day if I remember to eat.   My mind is going crazy, I am constantly thinking about how we need to have another baby but I’m not even emotionally stable enough to shower at the moment so that seems a little premature.  I just want my baby inside me again.  I keep feeling phantom kicks and then I cry some more.  My milk came and went, but that just made me sad again.  

And here’s the real kicker: I am fucking surrounded by pregnant women all due at the same time I was.  My two best friends are due with girls a week before and after me.  Also due that month are my two neighbors, my cousin, and my coworker.  I’m staying off social media but that just makes me feel even more detached from my friends and family.  Everyone's trying to be really supportive but I've just shut them out.  I only really talk to my husband and my parents. 

So here I am, on my couch for the third day in a row crying, stinky, anorexic, and looking at pictures of my dead baby.  I just don’t know how I am supposed to get through this.

103,2048,confidence,<praw.reddit.Reddit object at 0x7f12a630cd90>,,ttcafterloss,"Hi all, I'm a new member of the baby loss club. Warning- this turned into wall of text, sorry. I didn't realise how much i needed to get it all out.

One week ago today, my waters broke and  I gave birth to my ID twin girls, Chloe and Cara at 24 weeks.

This was my first pregnancy,  and we were shocked when it happened after only 3 months of NTNP. My mother and all of my sisters have had fertility issues and miscarriages, so I had prepared myself for a long wait. At 8 weeks, we found out it was twins and we couldn't have been happier. Everyone else would only tell us how hard it was going to be, and how we would need so much help, but we were over the moon.

I knew the pregnancy was going to be high risk because the girls shared a placenta. I read all about TTTS, and was worried about it, but I told myself it only affects 10% of monochorionic twins- that's a 90% chance that we will be fine!

Even so, I was cautious. We had scans every 2 weeks, and I was so nervous before each one. My mother was on my back about planning a baby shower, getting the nursery set up, getting ready, but I didn't want to buy a single thing for fear of jinxing it.

When I was 19+5,  I bought a pack of diapers and wipes which were on sale. At 20 weeks on the dot, I went in for a scan and found out the girls has TTTS Stage 1. I KNOW its stupid and illogical, but I wish so badly that I could go back in time and not buy those diapers- would that have changed anything?
 
We went through a rollercoaster with TTTS. Within a week, they went from Stage 1 to Stage 3. Initially, we were told laser surgery was the way to go- that gave both babies a 60% chance of surviving, and 85% of one surviving. Then at 21 weeks we were told that we couldn't have laser surgery because my placenta was completely anterior and they had no place to enter. Baby A's brain was showing ventriculomegaly which meant probable brain damage, and our dr had little hope of either of the babies surviving, and if they did they would likely be disabled. He told us our options were to terminate or to wait and see if they survive.

My husband and I decided to wait and see, to hopefully make it to 26 weeks for an MRI and see what the damage was like before making a decision. At 22 weeks, our ultrasound showed a slight improvement- our donor baby had a visible bladder which we hadnt seen for 2 weeks, and her dopplers were normal. They had gone from Stage 3 back to Stage 1.

3 days later, I lost my mucus plug. Went to Emergency, they checked for amniotoc fluid (none) and did a cervical exam (closed)  and sent me on my way with instructions to just attend my regular scan appointment on Friday.

On Friday, everything looked good. Still Stage 1, and the donor baby had a visible bladder AND a tiny amount of fluid! Cruelly, we began to have hope that both babies would be okay.

Two days later, my waters broke. I went straight to Emergency and was admitted. They did the test and confirmed amniotoc fluid. We had an ultrasound expecting the worst, but both babies had heartbeats and there was still plenty of fluid around the recipient baby. Our Dr said that there is a 50% chance of delivering in the next few days, but if we can avoid that then we may be able to keep them in until viability. Our dr had already told us at a previous appointment that although some babies can survive at 24 weeks, he was of the opinion that ours would not, and likely wouldn't be able to until 26-28 weeks. He reiterated that to us again that day.

We went back up to L&D, and another Dr told us we needed to make a decision- they can give me steroids and commit to doing everything they can for the babies if I do go into labour. Or we can do nothing, and if labour happens then we let nature takes its course. We chose the second. It's a decision that I struggle with. Sometimes I think we did the right thing, and other times I wonder- would at least one of them still be here if we had tried? I don't know what the answer is.

They sent me from L&D to the antenatal ward and said I would be here until birth, however long that may be. We were only in that room for a short time when I started getting pains. Were they contractions, the mifwives asked. Well, I don't know, I've never had contractions before. They said if they were contractions, they would come and go regularly and I would feel my stomach tighten. Mine pain was more constant at the start- they never really went away.

As I got more uncomfortable, they decided to take me down to L&D again. ""Just in case"".

In L&D, they confirmed that I was in labour. They gave me some endone for the pain, and one of the midwives told me that sometimes when your waters break, you can have labour that stops. Sometimes even the pain relief is enough to get labour to stop on its own. I focused on that, just hoping that it would stop on its own. 

Nobody was really checking on me. I never had a cervical check after labour started. The pain moved from my belly to my tail bone- I had heard of 'back labour"" before, and I thought that was what I was experiencing. I paged a nurse, told her that the pain had moved lower. She gave me some Panadine Forte and told me the Drs would assess in 30 minutes. I waited about 10 minutes. I was feeling what I now know is the urge to push, but I didn't know it at the time. I paged the nurse again and asked for the Dr to assess now. He came in about 5 minutes later, got a speculum and sat down between my legs. As soon as he sat down he put down the speculum and said 'It's right there'. The next part is a bit of a blur, but our donor twin Chloe was born. Her nose was a bit squashed and her head was a funny shape - I believe she died in the birth canal, I had the push feeling for so long before they checked me. How I wish I had known to make somebody pay attention to me earlier- but I hadn't done any birthing classes yet, I didn't know what to expect or what I would feel.

I held Chloe while we waited for Twin B, but my contractions completely stopped. I was put on a drip to induce and the Dr broke Cara's waters- there was so much, litres and litres. After an hour or so, Cara was born alive. She made a few tiny cries and I held her. One nurse asked if we were going to try and resuscitate and we had to say no. I kind of hate that nurse.

Cara lived for around 45 minutes and my husband and I got to hold her. She was so perfect. I was trying to birth the placenta but it wasnt happening. I could feel gushes of what I thought was fluid, but was actually blood. They told me I'd need surgery to remove the placenta. 

Initially I was going to have a spinal, but I kept losing blood and the anesthesiologist said I had to have a GA. They took me to the theatre and were prepping me, and I was feeling really lightheaded. I told them so. Then I blinked and when I opened my eyes, someone had a mask over my mouth and I was gasping for breath. There were about 30 people in the room, and one of them was saying 'Code Blue Adult female...'. One nurse was holding my hand telling me I was going to be okay. I heard somebody say I had 'no outputs' for 30 seconds. I was scared. They told me they were going to put me under, and I remember thinking that I wouldn't wake up. I thought that at least I will be with my babies, but I felt so terrible for husband who was going to lose us all at once.

Thankfully though I did wake up. I had lost 2.5 litres of blood and needed a transfusion, but they didn't really have an explanation about why I crashed. My discharge paper list the reason as 'cervical shock'.

I went back to my room and our families were there to meet the babies. I was so tired, I just wanted them to leave but didn't want to say so. I didn't want to hold the babies because I was scared that I would drop them, i was so tired.

We kept the babies in a cold cot with us for 2 days, but in hindsight I wish I would have spent more time with them in my arms. I think I was in shock- it wasn't until the last day that I realised that this is it- I have to leave them here. I will never hold them again.

Its now been a week and I am just so sad- I just want to scream with it, i just want to go back in time to when they were with me.

I can't stop thinking about TTC again. I want to start straight away, but I'm scared of how I will feel being pregnant again. Part of me is desperately hoping for twins again (the odds are very low), and part of me is terified that it will be twins and we will go through this again.

I am scared that if we wait, we will have trouble TTC and we won't be able to have a faily. I'm scared that if we do get pregnant, I'll hemorrhage again and die.

I am so full of contradictory emotions. I miss the girls so much already. Tomorrow is their cremation and I don't know how I will get through it.

My husband and family have been so wonderful but nothing helps. Sometimes I feel normal, and it feels so wrong. Sometimes I can't breathe with how much it hurts.",t2_wpbq3,False,,0,False,Intro: Loss at 24 weeks,[],r/ttcafterloss,False,0,intro,0,,,False,t3_4zwqxa,False,dark,0.98,,public,29,0,{},,,False,[],,False,False,,{},Intro,False,29,,False,self,False,,[],{},,True,,1472368153.0,text,0,,,text,self.ttcafterloss,False,"<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=""md""><p>Hi all, I&#39;m a new member of the baby loss club.

<p>Cara lived for around 45 minutes and my husband and I got to hold her. She was so perfect. I was trying to birth the placenta but it wasnt happening. I could feel gushes of what I thought was fluid, but was actually blood. They told me I&#39;d need surgery to remove the placenta. </p>

<p>Initially I was going to have a spinal, but I kept losing blood and the anesthesiologist said I had to have a GA. They took me to the theatre and were prepping me, and I was feeling really lightheaded. I told them so. Then I blinked and when I opened my eyes, someone had a mask over my mouth and I was gasping for breath. There were about 30 people in the room, and one of them was saying &#39;Code Blue Adult female...&#39;. One nurse was holding my hand telling me I was going to be okay. I heard somebody say I had &#39;no outputs&#39; for 30 seconds. I was scared. They told me they were going to put me under, and I remember thinking that I wouldn&#39;t wake up. I thought that at least I will be with my babies, but I felt so terrible for husband who was going to lose us all at once.</p>

<p>Thankfully though I did wake up. I had lost 2.5 litres of blood and needed a transfusion, but they didn&#39;t really have an explanation about why I crashed. My discharge paper list the reason as &#39;cervical shock&#39;.</p>

<p>I went back to my room and our families were there to meet the babies. I was so tired, I just wanted them to leave but didn&#39;t want to say so. I didn&#39;t want to hold the babies because I was scared that I would drop them, i was so tired.</p>

<p>We kept the babies in a cold cot with us for 2 days, but in hindsight I wish I would have spent more time with them in my arms. I think I was in shock- it wasn&#39;t until the last day that I realised that this is it- I have to leave them here. I will never hold them again.</p>

<p>Its now been a week and I am just so sad- I just want to scream with it, i just want to go back in time to when they were with me.</p>

<p>I can&#39;t stop thinking about TTC again. I want to start straight away, but I&#39;m scared of how I will feel being pregnant again. Part of me is desperately hoping for twins again (the odds are very low), and part of me is terified that it will be twins and we will go through this again.</p>

<p>I am scared that if we wait, we will have trouble TTC and we won&#39;t be able to have a faily. I&#39;m scared that if we do get pregnant, I&#39;ll hemorrhage again and die.</p>

<p>I am so full of contradictory emotions. I miss the girls so much already. Tomorrow is their cremation and I don&#39;t know how I will get through it.</p>

<p>My husband and family have been so wonderful but nothing helps. Sometimes I feel normal, and it feels so wrong. Sometimes I can&#39;t breathe with how much it hurts.</p>

(Trigger warning- missed miscarriage)
(Some profanity)

I have PCOS. Have had it for many, many years now. I am obese, and all interventions to help bring my weight down have failed. I have had two miscarriages in the past three years, and last year we went through a long and expensive IUI battle that ended with nothing. IVF is not an option. The kicker is that I can produce eggs (thank, Clomid), and my husband has good sperm, so it's really like unexplained infertility once you get to this point.

I have tried to be open about my later term miscarriage. I want the people around me to know that I once was pregnant, and that it sucked going in every week for ultrasounds and getting bad news. I guess I've also been open about that because I feel left out of the whole rite of passage that is pregnancy. 

As a result, whenever a friend is pregnant, they usually let me know first, privately, before posting their announcement online. This, I guess, is a blessing and a curse. I'm glad they spare me the trigger of their too-cute-to-stand announcement photos, and the inevitable profile picture switch to sonogram mode. But I am also angry that they feel like I'm so fragile that they have to consult me before posting their news. I just get angrier when I realize that they're right, and that I'm going to be bitter, angry, and cry when I get the news, no matter when.

I am so pissed, guys. I'm angry that another friend is getting to have a baby. I'm angry that my body is so fucking destroyed that it can't function properly. I'm angry that I can't get the help I need medically to help me lose weight, which I'm told would make it SO EASY (sarcastic doctor voice) to get pregnant. I'm especially angry that they get to post their pictures and get the world's approval- that they will have 300 acquaintances tell them, in 24 hours, how incredibly special they must be, and how great they'll be as parents.

I'm so over it. I'm violently angry, but I feel like I have no space in which to let it all out. That's why I'm here, I guess. I even created a new account so that I could talk about it without risking discovery by the very friends who think I'm delighted. I figured if anyone must know how I feel, it will be women who have had the pinnacle of womanly experience placed right in front of them, within arms reach, and then have had it snatched away, never getting the experience of reveling in their pregnancies. 

I hope there's a next time for us. I hope someday we'll get to change our profile pictures, too. Maybe I'd feel differently about the news I'm getting if I knew there was a struggle involved. But I don't really want to get into humanizing these mothers-to-be; I just want to be delivered of the red hot, burning ache that is filling my heart right now. 

Thanks.

My periods are usually 1-2 days heavy bleeding with strong cramps, then 4-5 days of decreasing bleeding. For the last 4 or so days I've had light bleeding. No cramping at all, which never happens with my period - I ALWAYS have killer cramps. I had moodiness (shocking) and a few breakouts on my face also typical for my period. But this bleeding is light flow, pinkish red color (nothing dark or brown) like what I'd expect a day before my period really hit - but nothing big ever came. At first I thought possible implantation symptoms, but it seemed it was more light bleeding than just a bit of spotting. According to my BBT tracking and monitoring cervical mucous (I don't remember all the acronyms for this stuff), I did ovulate but then started light bleeding roughly six days after that. Thoughts? Random mid-cycle bleeding post D&C or is this an actual period? What was y'alls first periods after your D&C?
