I found out yesterday that I had a MMC about two weeks ago. We were waiting until our NIPT was completed with clear results, so only my partner and I know. I chose medical management, but I am waiting until this weekend to utilize the pills due to my work schedule.

I know neither of us have really processed it yet, and my partner expressed concerns about not wanting to try again, which of course makes me panic. In this moment, my only consolation is trying again. I know that he could change his mind and be okay with more attempts, but the fear that he won’t be is overwhelming.

Is it irrational to think that if we do try again successfully that I should wait to tell him until I have low-risk NIPT results in hand? It’s not that he isn’t supportive, but he is so much more hesitant than I am and I want to protect him and our future attempts. Is that selfish? Deceptive? Am I losing my mind completely???

This loss was the worst because there was a baby and a heartbeat only weeks ago. Everything  looked perfect, until it wasn’t. My other losses never had a confirmed heartbeat, which led me to feel so much safer this time, an obvious mistake.

It took 8 months to get pregnant with my son, my former doctor reassured me that I would get pregnant fast, as most of her patients do. 17 months later, I'm not pregnant again. I've had to switch doctors due to insurance, and my new doctor isn't worried, but he basically said my old doctor was wrong - there is no correlation between having been pregnant and getting pregnant again. It's anecdotal. On top of which, secondary infertility is a real thing, especially when grief causes stress and anxiety. His plan was to instead sent me to a fertility specialist to make sure everything was okay. Spoiler alert, both my husband and myself are completely fertile and should have no issue. 

Still, the fertility specialist offered to do a round of IUI if it would help me feel better, as that's the only way he's comfortable prescribing fertility medication, especially when there is no indication of true fertility issues (as I've said, my hormones are good, my husbands sperm looks great, there's no indication of anything wrong beside it just taking time).

I don't know if this is the appropriate place to post this, and I apologize if it isn't. I just really need to vent to people who understand.

My husband and I have been ttc for going on three years now. In 2017 we became pregnant and right when I thought we were in the clear for first trimester shenanigans, we were told three things one right after another. 

1. What we thought was one baby was actually two.
2. The twins were Monoamniotic-Monochorionic.
3. They were already gone.

I miscarried them naturally four days later.

We've been trying ever since, including going to fertility doctors, but no luck so far. I've been diagnosed with PTSD because I'm weak I guess and still cry regularly. My husband puts on a better front but he hurts a lot too.

Now to the point. My husband has recently promoted into a new position, and his manager has a child about the age our twins would be. Any time my husband says anything like 'I stayed up pretty late last night' or 'We went out this weekend' his boss always says 'I can't wait until you have kids, then all of that will be gone.' He says it jokingly, but it hurts my husband every time. He told his boss that we've been trying to conceive for a long time and that we miscarried a set of twins, but his boss just keeps on going. 

The punch to the gut felt 'round the world was when my husband mentioned not sleeping well because of our cats sleeping in the bed with us, and he said ""At least you don't have a 16 month old sleeping in bed with you."" That's exactly how old our kids would be and my husband said to me ""I wanted so badly to tell him how much I wished I had my 16 month olds sleeping in bed with me.""

I'm not sure what to do. I'm worried my husband will snap soon and say something to his boss that he'll regret. But he doesn't want to make things awkward by going to HR. We thought telling him our background with children would stop the comments but it didn't. 

I was wondering if anyone else has dealt with a person like this and/or has any advice on how to handle it?

Thank you, sorry this is so long.

I had read that you can start ovulation testing based on your MC date. So I did that. I also took 2 pregnancy tests before to see if they were still reading positive.

I'm guessing that my hormones are still really all over the place from the MC.

35/f, trying for baby #1. 

I miscarried last week, at around four weeks. My first loss after a few months TTC. It was sort of a fluke that I even realized I had been pregnant. I had what seemed like a period, and had started to take OPKs a few days after it finished in prep for the next cycle. But the OPK was blazing positive which seemed weird.

<p>I miscarried last week, at around four weeks. My first loss after a few months TTC. It was sort of a fluke that I even realized I had been pregnant. I had what seemed like a period, and had started to take OPKs a few days after it finished in prep for the next cycle. But the OPK was blazing positive which seemed weird.

I understand this is not the normal protocol (some clinics will wait until after 3 losses), however, I’m in the military so for any treatment to occur I’ve got to be diagnosed. She ordered a number of tests and stated she’d call us when they were ALL back. we have an online portal where they’ll upload results and I have been stalking like crazy, mostly working myself up instead of being helpful because I am not a doctor and have no clue what any of this shit means LOL.

My husband and I both had chromosome tests, but those had to be mailed to some lab In Mississippi so that’ll be a while. 

I’m getting tripped up because she ordered a number of tests for clotting disorders, and I had to come back for more that weren’t expected. On my online portal, these tests are the only ones that results aren’t displayed, it says “contact your provider for these results.” 

Don’t want to bother her too much since we’re waiting for tests to come back still, but also, I do not like that they are being withheld. Am I being ridiculous? I understand her desire to get a whole picture and finish the tests, but on the other hand, if something has been identified I kind of want to start treating it now so that we can make progress on this!

I (29) had a miscarriage last March at 6 weeks. I wasn’t trying to get pregnant at the time but it was something me and my husband (32) were going to start trying for later this year. I only had 2 days between a positive test and then finding out at the doctors that I was likely going to miscarry, followed by a week of blood tests to confirm that it wasn’t a viable pregnancy.

I was devastated, had to take time off work and found it hard to leave my house. I’ve wanted to be a mother my whole life, having a family is the only thing I’ve ever been completely sure that I want.

Recently I had been doing much better emotionally, I got back into my routine and even enjoy spending time with my best friends baby who I adore. We started trying to conceive again on a holiday back home to Europe last month (I currently live in Canada) and since then I’ve had a lot of moments of intense anger and sadness. I feel as though the happiness of a first pregnancy has been taken away from me and now all I have is anxiety.

What has made it worse is that I’ve been referred for a pelvic ultrasound next week to check because I’ve been having unexplained cramps for over a week and negative pregnancy tests. I’ve convinced myself (this is without any doctors suggesting this to me at all) that I will find out that I have either miscarried again and my hcg levels never got high enough for a test to confirm or that I have a problem with my uterus or ovaries that will mean getting and maintaining a pregnancy really difficult.

Does anyone have any advice on TTC after a miscarriage and how to stay sane? How can I help my anxiety about miscarrying again and believe that I will have a baby? I feel so angry about losing my first pregnancy and keep thinking that I should be planning my nursery and birth plan now and instead I’m worrying about whether I’m infertile.

A bit about me: I'm 34 and have been TTC with my husband (40) since 2017. We had two losses in 2017, a single pregnancy at 6 weeks in August, and a twin pregnancy at 6.5 weeks in December. We decided to take some time from trying but lost again in November 2018 at 6.5 weeks, not confirmed until 8 wks. I've been seeing an RE since December 2018, with RPL panel providing no answers (aside from slightly elevated TSH for pregnancy), and a potential minor uterine septum, which was resected in February. We've been trying naturally since the procedure with no luck. 

I'm writing today because the last two years have taken a toll on us (we've also both lost our fathers in this time so it has only added to the grief and anxiety), and while we have generally always been able to communicate pretty easily and manage conflict in a healthy way, I'm finding that TTC is really starting to put a strain on our relationship.

We were to find out the gender of my first child, Xeno (jokingly nicknamed after the Xenomorphs from Alien). They were to be the first grand baby of my family and, while I had not planned them, I was so utterly in love with them.  We made an event of it, my S/O and myself going to the clinic; my parents driving in two hours to join us to see the reveal of their grandbaby. We were going to find out then go out to have lunch and celebrate before finally starting out shopping....

As the lab tech worked on the ultrasound, I noticed something was wrong. Xeno wasn't moving, and I couldn't hear or see a heart. She kept asking me to move, reposition myself, and empty my bladder... But I knew already what it was. I asked her over and over where the heart was, but she would never answer me, instead walking out, leaving my family and myself in silence. As my OBGYN came into the room, I knew what it was-- my Xeno had died. No warnings, no notice, just a silent fetal demise. 

I gave birth to them on February 15th at 11:30 PM. 23 weeks. 8 inches long.  A mere 145 grams.  Something was very wrong, but we weren't able to find out what. We weren't told a gender, and I wasn't able to hold them.

As August approaches, I'm going to try again. As a teacher, I have to time it for an August pregnancy so that the baby will be born during the summer-- FMLA had wiped me out from losing Xeno and having to take time off. I'm still dealing with the repercussions of being docked over 1,000 dollars a month. 

I'm not going to lie.... I am terrified, and I don't know how to handle it. I am so scared to go through the journey for a second time only to lose again. I had actually considered waiting until I was 20 weeks to tell anyone, but I realized quickly that I would be cutting off my support system if I did.

I never knew how desperately I wanted a child until they were taken away from me... I know I want to try-- that I will try in August-- but the thought of having to go through all that again... Finally telling my family, friends, my students, and my coworkers.. Only to lose it all and then, in a way, be punished for not being able to work afterwards.  I couldn't function for weeks after losing them. My support system was amazing, but.. I don't know if I can go through that again; I don't know what I will do if I go through it again.

I've always been irrationally paranoid about not being able to conceive. Probably because being a mom is the only thing I've ever wanted since I was a kid. My younger brother and his wife are expecting their second and I feel like I'm losing time.  My husband and I had been TTC for about 6 months when I got a BFP. 

At first I wanted to be cautious and not get excited, but the test kept getting bolder and more reassuring. I just felt that paranoia lift off my shoulders even though it still felt surreal. Then I was over the moon, constantly looking at baby stuff, talking about names, just genuine excitement over the whole situation. 

I had a MC near 6 weeks, and felt completely gutted. It was a mortifying experience and led me to feel like trying again would not be worth risking going through this utter heartbreak again. In a way I feel lucky that it wasn't a later MC because I don't know how I could've been even remotely salvageable after it. Even at early in the process, I felt like my heart was being ripped out of my chest. 

Now, a few weeks later, I feel like trying again and oddly I feel completely displaced from that whole experience. Like it didn't even happen. Logically I know it did, and logically I'm terrified of another MC. But emotionally, I now feel like that never even happened. Like a weird nightmarish dream almost. 

Idk why I'm telling you this, maybe to just get it out. I never really told anybody about the pregnancy or loss. I want a child desperately but I struggle with also trying to feel okay if I never do.

I’m not sure if this is the right place to post, but r/miscarriage freaks me out a little bit and I’m not really sure where else to go — for support, for advice, or I guess really for someone to just know I’m here today.  

Yesterday, my husband and I learned that we lost our baby — I go in for the procedure tomorrow.  Today is my 2nd wedding anniversary. We hadn’t planned anything just yet because I was experiencing some really severe nausea over the past 2 weeks and could barely eat anything other than bread. I’m feeling better now I’m that respect. Unfortunately, my husband had to go into work today because he is only allowed so many days off and wants to be there with me tomorrow — his company doesn’t recognize this loss as bereavement, of course. He’s pretty devastated, especially because his mother died a few months ago and sustained several very unfortunate losses of babies that I won’t go into for fear of TWs.  He feels she would have been able to provide some much needed perspective on the situation and I think generally he just misses her, of course. 

I guess the last piece of this puzzle is that our due date would have been the 14th anniversary of my father’s passing. I had really moved past the sadness of the day, but I’m expecting it to be a particularly hard one this year now. 

I’m not really sure what I would like to achieve by this post —- but I’m just not really sure to go from here. How do I celebrate my anniversary on a day like today? Do we just wait until this weekend or a day where we feel more ourselves? What do I do with myself today? What do I say to all my friends who keep reaching out to us either about our anniversary or simply to offer their condolences? Thinking to the future: what do I do on this particularly awful due date? I’m at a loss today. I tend to pride myself on having pretty good coping skills, but this is a new one for me.

He’s pretty devastated, especially because his mother died a few months ago and sustained several very unfortunate losses of babies that I won’t go into for fear of TWs.  He feels she would have been able to provide some much needed perspective on the situation and I think generally he just misses her, of course. </p>

<p>I guess the last piece of this puzzle is that our due date would have been the 14th anniversary of my father’s passing. I had really moved past the sadness of the day, but I’m expecting it to be a particularly hard one this year now. </p>

<p>I’m not really sure what I would like to achieve by this post —- but I’m just not really sure to go from here. How do I celebrate my anniversary on a day like today? Do we just wait until this weekend or a day where we feel more ourselves? What do I do with myself today? What do I say to all my friends who keep reaching out to us either about our anniversary or simply to offer their condolences? Thinking to the future: what do I do on this particularly awful due date? I’m at a loss today. I tend to pride myself on having pretty good coping skills, but this is a new one for me. I just keep having this overwhelming feeling like I want to escape but I’m trapped right here in my own body. I’m just looking for people who are trapped right alongside me, I guess? Thanks, guys.</p>

6 years ago I was 23 and living in NYC. A thousand miles away from family or anything familiar. I wanted love. I searched for love. Love I never received at home, in the way I wanted it. I  looked for it and gave it to people that had no business receiving it. Long story short, I met a guy who was no good for me. I knew it from the start. But he said he loved me. No man has EVER said they loved me until that point. (My dad was never vocal about his feelings.) 

Arguments turned from yelling, to pushing, to hitting, to locking myself in the room and him tearing the door down. He told me he’s sorry afterwards and that he loves me. I believed him. 
2 months later I find I’m pregnant. I take 5 pregnancy tests to make sure. They’re all positive. I have $18 to my name. It’s 10 degrees and snowing outside. I take the train and the bus to get to him to tell him so we can figure something out. I now have $13 to my name. 

I get to his house.. I’m scared and excited at the same time. Maybe this will mean things will turn for the better between us. Everything was a blur. I remember trying to get up from the bottom of the cement steps outside. I was in shock. It was hard to catch my breath as literally the wind was knocked out of me. Did he just really kick me down the stairs? But I’m carrying his child...?! How can he? 

I walked home. An hour and a half walk home in the cold. I tried to brush it off. I’m gonna make it without him. I’m gonna make this work. My roommate was home when I got there and she asked if I was hungry. I said no and went into my room and closed the door. 

Maybe 2-3 hours later, I have an alternating of dull and very sharp abdominal pain. I go to the bathroom to find my underwear in blood and I sit on the toilet to hear a clot drop in the water. 

I quickly get out of the bathroom and asked my roommate and get friend that just got there to drive me to the hospital. I told them I slipped on ice and fell down the stairs.

5 hours later.. an ultrasound, a CT, and a pill. I was no longer pregnant. They gave me a bucket to put in the toilet, told me to go to the bathroom and sent everything my body rejected into pathology. The nurse said, “it’s probably for the best” as he handed me the discharge papers and a pamphlet for grieving after miscarriage.

I was numb. I told no one (and only 2 people since that day). I have not spoken to my ex since. I moved back home 3 months later. 

6 years have gone by, I’m in a loving relationship and I still wonder what my child would have looked like... was it a boy or a girl? What are their interests? Favorite book? What funny things they would do or say.. 

I get jealous of any pregnant woman I encounter. I’m so happy for them, but secretly I get jealous because I want that to be me.

192,2048,confidence,<praw.reddit.Reddit object at 0x7f12a630cd90>,,ttcafterloss,"I’ve had diagnosed depression and anxiety since I was 18, but came off the meds to conceive, and have been off ever since 2016. After trying off and on since 9/16, we got pregnant in June 2018 (I found out on July 2), but we lost the baby at 8 weeks. Even with this loss, I wasn’t feeling LOW LOW. Just like a sadness, and a blow. But, I was optimistic about us conceiving again because the midwife who checked me out, and OB/GYN who helped me through the miscarriage were optimistic. Plus, I was happy to realize my body could actually conceive.

Months went by. Ovulation and periods, no conception. When the baby’s due date approached, I started to feel some old depression/anxiety symptoms come back: avoidance, difficulty sleeping/terribly critical inner voice and negativity, stress. Plus, the due date really started to make me sad: my baby would’ve been born by now, I thought. 

So, suggested by my OB, and at the urging of my best friend (who conceived via IUI after a year of fertility treatments) and my sister (a lesbian paying out of pocket on her sixth failed IUI), I contacted a fertility specialist. 

I can’t begin to explain the dread of this. I 99% chalk it up to my anxiety and negativity, but... the specialist made me feel so old, fat, and terrible. She explained that they wouldn’t want to start treatments on someone of my weight, but that we would need to start soon because of my age. She questioned me about why I would get a D&C (because it was offered to me when I was afraid and in a lot of physical pain?) and had a few lines of questioning overall that made me feel small and negative and kind of like a piece of shit. I just nodded and scheduled all the tests, gave my blood, and thanked everyone. But... When I got in the elevator to leave, I just broke down. Crying. And couldn’t stop, and walked out of the building and kept walking, past the parking lot, just walking and walking blindly, and having the worst anxiety I’ve ever had since I stopped the meds. 

I’ve given more blood, had genetic testing, a fluoroscopy, my husbands given his tests, things LOOK normal, still ovulating... not conceiving. Specialist wanted me to see a nutritionist, and referred me offsite to some place I’m not familiar with; they contacted me. I wasn’t okay with that because I don’t drive, it was kind of far away, so i contacted my own pcp instead for a referral because these specialist bills are already racking up. But, I’m really scared to go back. I’m mid-30s and need to drop 60 pounds stat, and I’m afraid to go back because weight has always been an issue for me since childhood, and I know it’s scary, but I keep thinking about how I did conceive that one time and I feel so terrible going back to that doctor still fat and old and just the feelings of hopelessness in that office...compared to the feelings of hope every time we try conceiving in our own. I think it might be in my head, but I have bad vibes like this doctor is annoyed by my fat ass just being there.

You know I want a baby, we all want a baby. But, I’m just so freaked out about the fertility specialists and all the appointments (in my first two weeks, I had 4 appointments), the atmosphere of hopelessness, that I mentally shut down. I haven’t been in 2 cycles. I keep thinking it can happen again, like before... I just need someone to talk me down.

She questioned me about why I would get a D&amp;C (because it was offered to me when I was afraid and in a lot of physical pain?) and had a few lines of questioning overall that made me feel small and negative and kind of like a piece of shit. I just nodded and scheduled all the tests, gave my blood, and thanked everyone. But... When I got in the elevator to leave, I just broke down. Crying. And couldn’t stop, and walked out of the building and kept walking, past the parking lot, just walking and walking blindly, and having the worst anxiety I’ve ever had since I stopped the meds. </p>

<p>I’ve given more blood, had genetic testing, a fluoroscopy, my husbands given his tests, things LOOK normal, still ovulating... not conceiving. Specialist wanted me to see a nutritionist, and referred me offsite to some place I’m not familiar with; they contacted me. I wasn’t okay with that because I don’t drive, it was kind of far away, so i contacted my own pcp instead for a referral because these specialist bills are already racking up. But, I’m really scared to go back. I’m mid-30s and need to drop 60 pounds stat, and I’m afraid to go back because weight has always been an issue for me since childhood, and I know it’s scary, but I keep thinking about how I did conceive that one time and I feel so terrible going back to that doctor still fat and old and just the feelings of hopelessness in that office...compared to the feelings of hope every time we try conceiving in our own. I think it might be in my head, but I have bad vibes like this doctor is annoyed by my fat ass just being there.</p>

<p>You know I want a baby, we all want a baby. But, I’m just so freaked out about the fertility specialists and all the appointments (in my first two weeks, I had 4 appointments), the atmosphere of hopelessness, that I mentally shut down. I haven’t been in 2 cycles. I keep thinking it can happen again, like before... I just need someone to talk me down. Sorry, ladies, for the rant...</p>

First some backstory: So my little sister’s baby shower is coming up in a few weeks. I just had my second 2nd trimester loss back in February. My sister is due at the end of September and I would’ve been due at the end of this month. Her shower will be the week of my due date. 

I have had very little contact with her since she announced her pregnancy shortly after my most recent loss. It’s just so hard, especially since my SIL (on my husband’s side) was pregnant along with me last year at the time of my first loss so I already have a niece who is a month younger than the first baby I lost would’ve been. I’m super happy for my sister but it’s just super crappy timing for me. It’s been hard being around my SIL’s baby a lot of the time and now I’ll have another niece or nephew that’s also a reminder of my other lost baby. (I don’t even know what the gender of my sister’s baby is yet).

So for my question: sitting through a baby shower right now is honestly the last thing on this planet that I want to do right now. I just don’t think I could do it. However, I don’t want to regret missing my little sister’s baby shower for her first baby. I am very fortunate and grateful to have an LC so I regret and feel bad already that I haven’t been there for her to answer questions and support her during her pregnancy. If it was for anyone other than my sister, I would absolutely skip it in a heartbeat. But I don’t want to regret not going. I feel like I’m damned if I do, damned if I don’t here. She lives out of state so I only see her a few times a year at most. She is traveling back home for the shower.

How could anyone know what to say in these circumstances. I was just trying to let it roll off but I would end up perseverating over it.</p>

<p>Today when a coworker used that term I tried to explain that I did not have a misscairage. He was totally receptive of that.</p>

<p>My question is, does it seem like I&#39;m overreacting with this? It always feels like a very awkward exchange.</p>
