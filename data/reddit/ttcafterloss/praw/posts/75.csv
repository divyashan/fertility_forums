I've been lurking around or a year or so - recently had my 3rd mc and decided to finally make an account. I'm still unfamiliar with most of the lingo and pretty naive when it comes to the more scientific ttc procedures. I'm 31, and will be married for 4 years this year. Probably will be long, but I'll share my journey so far anyway - will maybe update this as I continue my adventure. TW on some spoiler tags - feel free to skip.

2017: Spoke to my PCP and found a obgyn - cleared health with both drs, we were going to start ttc! Started taking prenatal vitamins. >!Red flag: I have a 4cm cyst, but it's also 4+ yrs old.!<

April 2018: My body might be HCG sensitive, and I mentioned it to my PCP at my annual exam there was a chance I was experiencing symptoms before my period was due. (I can feel my boobs just by walking around in my pjs - very odd since I never experienced boob changes during my period. >!Red flag: I've also been brown spotting for a couple of days !<) He adds HCG to my annual blood test, I get a call a week later -""congrats!"", and make appointment with my ob 9 days after my first blood test. She pokes around - ""I don't think you are.."" but my blood test was positive! I run over to my pcp's office and grab my lab work and rush back - 1804. ""Oh, you're still very early, lets run another blood test"" Get a call 2 days later, ""potential issue, it's at 1900. See me asap."" Another blood test. >!Brown spotting finally progressing to full period bleed.!< ""Your last test showed you were at 800.."" ""Yeah, I think I'm starting to mc."" Blood test 2 weeks later - 6. Unknown/unexplained, fluke, it was the first try - feel free try again after your next period.

July 2018: Starting to feel symptoms again, didn't want to see ob until it was further along. >!Red flag: felt a significant amount of (red) blood drop out of me while walking to bus stop!< Went to OB same day - ""yes, you're bleeding, I don't see anything yet, lets run blood test."" I go home and pass out - bleeding stops overnight. 8,088, progesterone 14.5. Blood test 2 days later: 12,580. See her again in 2 weeks - looks good, >!we have a heartbeat, measured at 6+3!<. >!Red flag: in my head - that's almost a week behind. I've also had (2) 1 day of sporadic brown spotting!<. ""Not sure if you were notified, I'm no longer delivering, I can recommend this OB""  Make an appointment with new OB for 3 weeks later. Attend a wedding out of town >!brown spotting!< . Day of OB appointment - received call ""Sorry OB is delivering today, please reschedule"". >!Day later, more spotting. ""Something is wrong."" !< Wake up next morning and text boss ""health issue"" not going to make it in. Stayed home, >!spotting progressed. It was a punch in the gut in every sense, it was physically painful.!<Next day, call up old OB, I need to see you, I think I mc'd. Confirmed loss, she sends retained tissue for testing, ""see me in a month"". Tissue appeared healthy, >!it was a girl!< , lets do more tests. Both you and your husband look healthy, though you might want to redo your MMR vaccine. Vaccinate, 3 months of no ttc. Healthy, unexplained.

April 2019: Some symptoms, no spotting, decided to do my annual and see new OB same day. >!Red flag: day before appointment-spotting!< Annual: confirmed through urine test, ""congrats, let us know if the ob wants to add any tests"" (no additional blood draw necessary). New OB: confirmed,>! no more than 6 weeks. Cyst increased to 7cm though.!< .>!Red flag: that's a week behind. And it very likely we conceived early based on when symptoms started. Got a fitbit late 2018, resting heartrate suggested I stopped supporting it 2 weeks ago. Cyst doubled in size.!< No blood test at ob, he's optimistic, despite knowing I had 2 mc already. I call PCP, please add HCG and progesterone to lab work. >!Spotting progressed.!< Call up old OB, pretty sure I mc'd. Confirmed. I would like to remove the cyst, ""I'll refer you to RE, and surgery etc."" Blood test. HCG was 3251 from annual exam 3 days ago.

They called today with my results. 6.8, confirmed miscarriage, not CP, no more testing, what to expect for the future, etc. We’re good. My OB’s recommendation is waiting two cycles to allow the uterine lining to rebuild. 

I’ve read as much as possible about others mc experiences and mine was nothing like them. I probably filled two or three pads in the entire 12 days of bleeding. I had one day of cramping (the night the spotting started) and one day of very small clots. Honestly, it was not as bad as what I was expecting. Regular periods are worse than the MC was for me. Regular menstrual cramps make me so uncomfortable, it’s difficult to sit, I’m constantly going to the bathroom because it’s hard to differentiate between cramps and feeling like I need to have a bowel movement. I can leak through a super tampon in an hour or two on my heavy flow day. I didn’t experience anything like that with this MC. 

I believe I found out about the pregnancy very early (wasn’t tracking that cycle) and I had back pain from the day before my expected period and that lasted a week. My guess is that as soon as that pain stopped, the baby stopped growing and I didn’t miscarry for another week and a half after that. 

That being said, there wouldn’t have been a ton of tissue to pass since it likely was around 5 weeks when it stopped growing. I’ve read everything from wait 6 cycles to wait no cycles. I just started tracking LH and temps again this week as my bleeding has finally stopped.

Started spotting at 8 weeks and went for check up ultrasound on Monday which showed no growth since week 7 and no heartbeat. It was devastating news because hubby and I really wanted this baby...
Obgyn warned me that the bleeding will get heavier before it gets better, said the embryo is still tiny at this stage.

Question and TMI : 
Dis anyone try to see the embryo in the blood your body was evacuating ?  I have no one else to ask and this seems so weird that I really want to see it. Despite the fact that all of my pregnancy symptoms are gone and I saw no heartbeat on the monitor I just need tangible proof that it's really over although I'm usually really easily grossed out by everything....

We had a little farewell ceremony with hubby and burned the ultrasound pictures from before so I have said my goodbyes but it's hard to get over it while my body is still in the process of getting rid of whatever is left of this pregnancy.

Any input or suggestion is appreciated. I have therapy scheduled in a few days but the days seem to last a million years at the moment and I just need something in the meantime. Please tell me it gets easier.

Upd :  after 2 hours of excrutiating pain it's really over. The pain was gradual so by the time I decided to take a painkiller and for it to have an effect I was howling like a wild animal just couldn't help it. It felt horrible. Now the pain is cometely gone.
I saw the embryo, it looked like nothing - a tiny ball of cells. It made it easy to detach from the vision of a baby we had, this is not it at all. I am glad my body did its job and expulsed it and I didn't need a medical intervention.

I had my first loss - a missed miscarriage - in October 2018. Went in for our 8 week appointment and there was no fetal heartbeat. It was somewhat easy to handle as we were told it was a random thing and my odds of another miscarriage were less than 2%. So we tried again.

<p>What tests should I request be done? I assume these should be done before I get pregnant again? Can someone walk me through the process of what steps there are? </p>

<p>Thank you ❤️</p>

On April 24, 2018, we lost our first child, Jeremiah, at 17w. I'd been in the hospital the week before on Wed/Thurs with a high fever, but we heard his heartbeat and they did an ultrasound. Nothing to be concerned about except that my cervix was a bit short, so I made an appointment with my OB for the next Tuesday expecting to just be put on bedrest. Instead, I was told that my baby had passed and was sent back to the hospital to be induced. It was about 4 hours from the time I got the news to the time I delivered. However, the process of getting answers about what happened took months, and it was ultimately concluded that either the virus I'd gotten had passed to him or that there was some kind of infection. I was basically told it was bad luck and to try again.

&#x200B;

The past year has been intense. I've never felt a grief like this before, and it was compounded by a MMC in Oct and the loss of a dear friend in Dec. Both times I conceived was with the aid of Clomid as I don't ovulate on my own, but it doesn't seem to be working anymore (waiting to see if an increased dose will work this month, but I'm on CD19 with no temp shift). Now I seem to be facing infertility issues and trying to decide how far I'm really willing to go. I suspect I'll make an appt with an RE and decide from there. I know there are still plenty of options, but I'm just not sure if I can handle putting my body/emotions through that.

&#x200B;

Meanwhile, nearly every woman I know has given birth in the past year or is currently pregnant. One of my high school friends gave birth on the 24th to a little boy, and I felt like I'd been punched in the gut. I feel so isolated. I can't relate to anyone with LC, and it's still painful to be around children at all. I also can't relate to those who have never had kids. I'm in motherhood purgatory, and I feel like I have no place in the world.

&#x200B;

A few weeks ago, I was in a business meeting and finally got the question I'd been dreading for a year: ""Do you have any kids?"" My rehearsed answer was always ""none living"" as I want to acknowledge my lost babies and don't really care about making people uncomfortable anymore, but in that moment, my instinctive response was ""no."" I didn't want to talk about it with that woman, and definitely not at work when I was already feeling fragile because of the upcoming anniversary. Afterwards, I felt physically ill. I felt like I'd just denied their existence and minimized their importance. There doesn't seem to be a good response to that question, honestly.

My wife and are expats living in Shanghai. On Friday, I was travelling in Beijing and received a phone call from her worried about tummy pains. We got her off to a clinic to be told baby was fine...but her cervix was 3cm dilated and that she had an infection. I rushed back to Shanghai and got to the hospital near midnight; 30 minutes later her waters broke. After a sleepless night where we were petrified about ongoing contractions, we were told the risk of further infection was very high and odds of carrying even to 25 weeks very low. And, even if we did get to 25 weeks, there were high risks our boy would not be well.

So we made the decision to terminate. Our boy was perfectly healthy at the time but we couldn’t put him through what was to come. And I couldn’t risk my wife.
Our little boy was born later that afternoon but the placenta retained. We had no family with us and our close friends in China all abroad. It was a terrible day which seemed to build in terms of stress and fear. The next was the same, as the placenta still retained and eventually had to be surgically removed under general anaesthetic.

Now I’m lying in bed in the hospital, my wife’s infection seemingly under control. I’m sure we made the right decision, but it is so heartbreaking knowing he was fine in there until we took the pills. That it was our decision to hurt him. We got his little footprints yesterday and he had my long second toe.

The experience was so terrifying, the two of us all alone and with no prospect of a happy ending, I’m so scared of going through it again. We want to be parents - I didn’t know how much until it was too late - but this was just so horrible.

I know it’s early days and this is probably normal fear, guilt and grief, but I needed to articulate things somehow.

Before my MMC in December, I could tell when I ovulated based on my body’s signals. It lined up with my glow app’s predictions and I rarely used OPKs,  and never tried wondfos for ovulation. Now, though, I’m supposed to test days 10-21. I started at day 8 just to have a “control” to compare my variables. OPK said no, but the wondfo had a faint line.

Day 9, same thing.
Day 10, OPK said YES + and wondfo’s line got marginally darker.
Day 11, OPK said NO - and wondfo got lighter.

Before I used the smiley face predictors that lead me up to peak day, so I guess I’m confused why I’d be getting no now, and why my wondfo lines never got definitively dark. Do the cheaper OPKs only read the surge once? I was under the impression I’d get dark lines from the wondfo at least for a few days during ovulation. I’m just really confused.

I just spent the last 3½ months getting a workup done at a fertility clinic and talking to other specialists. As of today this is what we have learned since trying to get answers:

\-Officially diagnosed with PCOS, now on Metformin 3x daily and Dexamethasone 

\-Uterine polyp found in 2019, formed sometime after MC #2 because saline ultrasound came back clean in 2018. 

\-Positive for MTHFR C677T variety, taking 5mg of folate daily

\-Positive ANA 1:640 (high), referred to rheumatologist. Doesn't seem to be causing autoimmune disease currently but will need a yearly follow up. 

\-Positive HLA (not sure which marker, I didn't get a copy of the preliminary report and we won't get the actual summary for 3-4 more weeks), indicates autoimmune activity. This plus positive ANA has the RE concerned. Prescribed daily Lovenox/Enoxparin injections. 

We TTC this cycle and I'll find out next week if it took. I don't have a problem getting pregnant, just staying pregnant. I can't seem to keep them. Growth always stopped at 5-6 weeks, 2 were missed MC and lasted between 7-8 weeks before my body was ready to let them go. 

I've got a gnarly bruise from my first shot, I just did my 3rd one tonight. This shit stings! I watched a youtube how to video 3 times to psych myself up for it. I want it to be worth it, when I said I would try anything I didn't realize the universe would throw needles at me.

I ended up In urgent care today because AF decided to take her sweet time (due 4/19/19 but spotted got half a day on 4/17/19 and then no AF in sight), and of course the UPTs have all come back negative, but I felt like trash (hot flashes, nausea, light headedness) and I thought maybe something serious was wrong with me so I went in.

This month has been particularly hard on me. I turned 26 (yea, still young, blah blah) but I feel the weight of my fertility on my shoulders more and more as the days pass by. It’s getting to a point where I don’t even think I’ll ever be able to get pregnant at this point and I want to give up.

I’m so over throwing myself pity parties on the couch at 11 PM once a month because my body isn’t doing what it’s supposed to do. 

And then I read all the other women’s experiences and feel like shit because my situation isn’t nearly as awful as it could be, but I still feel lost and broken like so many of the women out there who have had worse.

I’m not looking for advice or pity, I just wanted to vent. I’m thinking about going to see mental health about my stress and anxiety over my fertility status.

<p>I’m not looking for advice or pity, I just wanted to vent. I’m thinking about going to see mental health about my stress and anxiety over my fertility status. </p>

<p>tl:dr TTC for 3 years. First and only pregnancy an Ectopic pregnancy 1 year ago. Just bitching about my current situation and feeling lost and over it all.</p>

That was devastating and I didn’t get out of bed for a couple weeks.. But, all the research said you’re more likely to conceive in the first three months following a loss, so we made it our mission, and succeeded after the only once cycle ! 

It was crazy, and I thought it was a sign that nothing would go wrong this time! EDD for this one was August 5, 2019. But, after a bunch of back and forth, and presumptions (but no proof) of ectopic or molar, we lost that pregnancy too.. proceeded to bleed for over 6 weeks. Now I have gone over 3 months without bleeding at all, even after taking provera! 

I’m currently taking a month of birth control to regulate things, like I did a year ago, so I’m really hoping to be able to start back on the clomid again in a couple more weeks. It’s been so hard being in ‘limbo’, and not actively trying, but I’m hoping for better luck in the next year, for myself and everyone else here!

I apologize if this comes off all over the place, but BC makes me feel so emotional, rage-y, and sad, basically all at the same time, on top of feeling distressed by knowing I should be very pregnant right now, or a new momma..

We have two boys, one of which was from IVF. Between them I had two chemical pregnancies and a stillborn baby girl at 25 weeks. We were desperately hoping for another girl from our IVF to help fill that massive hole a little, but I miscarried our only female embryo.

I’ve had 3 more early losses since our IVF success. It’s now to the point that I don’t even bother telling my husband if I get a positive test, because what does it matter? Our most recent loss about a week ago ended with a D&C and I opted for genetic testing just to be safe (didn’t tell my husband this because I didn’t want to stress him out). Results came in today and of course it was a genetically normal female that I lost...again. Most likely cause of the loss was a SCH - exacerbated by blood thinners I was on as part of an autoimmune protocol (lovenox + baby aspirin). I’m absolutely crushed. I know my husband would be too if I were to tell him. Thing is...I don’t feel like I want to tell him.

We have two boys, one of which was from IVF. Between them I had two chemical pregnancies and a stillborn baby girl at 25 weeks. We were desperately hoping for another girl from our IVF to help fill that massive hole a little, but I miscarried our only female embryo.</p>

<p>I’ve had 3 more early losses since our IVF success. It’s now to the point that I don’t even bother telling my husband if I get a positive test, because what does it matter? Our most recent loss about a week ago ended with a D&amp;C and I opted for genetic testing just to be safe (didn’t tell my husband this because I didn’t want to stress him out). Results came in today and of course it was a genetically normal female that I lost...again. Most likely cause of the loss was a SCH - exacerbated by blood thinners I was on as part of an autoimmune protocol (lovenox + baby aspirin). I’m absolutely crushed. I know my husband would be too if I were to tell him. Thing is...I don’t feel like I want to tell him.

Some of you may have seen me bellyaching in the daily chats about my wild hormonal saga post-MMC - my uterus has gone rogue! I am now on day 31 of bleeding after kickstarting the MC part of my MMC with misoprostol on March 23rd. The thing is, at my first follow-up test after the MC, I was on day 17 and the bleeding had been slowing down and was just spotting at that point. Since then, however, it picked back up again. I am worried he's going to dismiss me as having had a long period starting on ""CD"" 21, since that's when the bleeding started back up again and it's back down to spotting again now for the last few days.

My BBT makes it VERY clear that this is not a period - I had (a) positive LH tests on CD 19 and 20, and (b) BBT well above 98.0F starting CD22. So that's not my period (period BBT for me are usually below 97.9F). The increased bleeding and resumption of spotting is strongly correlated with days where I either move around a lot or had sex with my husband, which makes me quite concerned that I may have an injury of some sort that is getting reopened and bleeds again whenever I overexert myself.

I need my doctor to take me seriously and am worried I will be dismissed. I've assembled my BBT chart and overlaid all the relevant info including my LH test results, bleeding and spotting days, physical activity, and sex days on it as well.

<p>I have only read a few research on it but the success rate looks promising and I&#39;m now getting out of bed to start my day. </p>

<p>My husband is at work and we&#39;ve not discussed our fertility struggles with anyone else so you guys were the only ones I could share this with. </p>

<p>A big thank you to everyone who shares. The stories I read here have helped me to cope with my loss and not feel alone. I still cry but it&#39;s getting better.</p>

126,2048,confidence,<praw.reddit.Reddit object at 0x7f12a630cd90>,,ttcafterloss,"Hello beautiful people! It's 1 AM right now where I'm at and I am just not able to sleep. I just needed something off my chest, this is going to be a long read so please bear with me. (also i have not really posted so much, so if i have broken some kind of rule about posting, PLEASE PLEASE correct me/educate me, thank you)

Back in early 2017, my husband and I decided to finally have children. we have been married for 4 years and are still in our early mid 20's and thought that THIS is the time that we should try and make and addition to our family. And with all our friends pretty much announcing their pregnancy one after another, in a way i felt pressured but at the same time I truly always imagined myself eventually being a mom, and i felt now was the time to try.

\*Pressure: from friends and most especially from My MIL\*

Came august 2017 my supposed period never came, I felt nervous but didn't want to be too hopeful. My period was kind of predictable then, and i thought it was just late for a day like how it would be in some of the months. But it didn't come, so only one way to find out now I had to test, and.. it's positive! I was so happy. Finally I am going to be a mom! 

I was 6-7 weeks in and because of all this stupid pressure esp from MIL, even though I felt like it was too early to announce it to the in-laws but I still did,  because of excitement and so MIL would stop pestering me about when are we gonna have babies.

 Little background about MIL, my FIL remarried my now MIL , who spoke the same native language i do, and she's nice, and a very religious woman. She always shares about how she prayed for that right man to come into her life even at her age (early, mid 40's) and that, she was happy and lucky that a good man like my FIL was the one that came into her life. I couldn't be more happier with how things turned out. couldn't have been more thankful because previous MIL and I did not get along. 

Anyway, for the past probably year, give or take, before we even TTC she has asked me  a dozen of times, when were we going to try and have a baby? That she'd really love to have a baby in our family, since she is older now and probably won't be able to make any children (she was never married before and never had any children). Every time in our casual conversation never fails to ask about it.

So we announce the pregnancy and everybody was happy.. but she just had to make it weird.. by later touching my belly. Like, I'm 6-7 weeks only that's probably my fats your rubbing (which it is) and it's f\*cking weird!!!! \*sigh\* We continued on with our lives, trying our best to keep a healthy pregnancy,  then the most terrible thing happened. I miscarried. I won't go into more details about that, but as all women that went through this, it does not matter how long the pregnancy has been. A loss IS a loss.

I started questioning everything, if i did something wrong, maybe i just was not ready, I was not prepared for this, that it just was not my time. Asked God why? but then accepted that ""He probably knew better, I just don't understand it now"" It's just that, I never thought it would be me. I know it happens, but i didn't think it would be me.

So as I go through that my MIL just had to asked, how did it feel and say that that I can just try again (cause you know it's all easy she probably thinks) and said that they are praying for me so we can try again. Really? I just suffered the greatest emotional heartbreak of my life and you tell me that you are praying for me so we can have another baby. I know she meant well, I know she does, but right now I just need to mourn. I just needed my 1st baby to know how much it hurt for us to lose him/her. I hope you understand.

And days passed, I tried to continue no matter how hard. But like I said MIL just never fails to do something so inconsiderate. after our loss, she goes on to rub my belly again and say that she is always praying for me that we can be blessed with children. You know how much of a punch it the gut that felt and how much self control i had to exert to not say anything rude. BTW if you want to read something in line with this topic to this read this:  [https://www.tabletmag.com/jewish-life-and-religion/187758/dont-pray-for-me](https://www.tabletmag.com/jewish-life-and-religion/187758/dont-pray-for-me) It was a good read for me and somehow help me feel like this were all natural emotions. I felt all this conflicting emotions because i just felt more bitter than thankful about being prayed for. It almost felt like she slapped me on the face. Actually I would have felt better if she just slapped me, than say anything.

So again i let it slide, She would still talk about children, about how she prays for us, because she knows it's not for her anymore, she wanted to but she knows she can't. All that kind of talk that I know and I can sense that she wants to have children of her own but she follows that rule that you have to pray more for everybody else than for yourself (like in the article). Which again I know her intentions are nice, but just tell me upfront that you and FIL are trying. and don't try to use me in your prayer so you can ask for your own wishes, or tell me that you are praying for me. I already have enough people rubbing it in my face everyday that I don't have a child. That everybody else is getting pregnant except for me. 

In our journey to TTC we ran along some few health issues, i kept getting infection after infection after my MC. Not sure if it's because of stress or what, but on one of our Dr's appointment, we told them we were gonna be late on visiting them because we gotta see the doctor. I left it at that and hoped she would, But as usual, she just had to pepper me questions   
as soon as we met them that day,  if"" is it because im pregnant???"" and I said ""no"" AND she just would not stop, and asked that same question again like did tou not hear me?..  like, you just can't get a clue?? do you, so I answered,  ""NO, I am not pregnant!! I have an infection >:( "" (and I don't want to tell you, because its MY BUSINESS but you just have to make it yours too. Now will you leave me alone) and She was just ""ok, \*rubs my back\* it's ok"" Like really you tell me to calm down when you triggered me!!

So fast forward to present (recent time). We received a news from my hubby's FIL, ""you're gonna be a Big brother again."" ""...YAY! "" I was not sure how far along she is now but,  I did not have the courage to ask, 'cause you know, I exerted too much of my energy to be fake happy for them while trying my hardest to hold back tears. 

 I felt so betrayed by the world. I felt denied. I just wished I die right on the spot so I don't have to endure this BS anymore. 

Came next day, we had to see them (I was reluctant but my relationship was more important than my stupid ego/jealousy) and I had to take in more, ""i congratulated her"" and without fail she just had to say ""Oh, we beat you."" in a casual way, again i know she probably thought it was a funny comment, seeing as how they are a lot older than us. (and probably in her mind, they were not trying, because they were older even though, let's be honest they were hopeful - nothing bad about it- and WERE trying, I just had enough of the Hypocrisy) 

Wow thanks. That's just what I needed to hear... to die inside, to hate the world , to hate everything! Oh and I have to endure more, So came Easter, after a tough battle with myself and my sanity for half of the day(thanks to my hubby who was so, so supportive <3 I love him so much, I dunno how i could have survived this hurdle without him) I picked myself up again and went to see them and be a family on this day and be truly happy for them. I came to terms with myself that I am being being too petty, that i should stop this jealousy and get my shit together. That she just didn't mean all the things she said to be mean, and even if it IS mean, that was NOT her intention.

So we went. And I felt lighter and more collected, but not smart as you'll see because of course, I had to ask her about all this questions , about when did they know, and all those pregnancy questions, but that was a mistake (I just never learn) So she started telling me about all this things that she was doing so weirdly before she even knew (which is understandable and normal or not normal i guess depends on the ""pregnancy symptom/ craving"" you are having lol.) How she was praying for us  AND (in a casual what-I'm-gonna-say-next-is-not-as-important-so-I-passingly- say-it) was praying for themselves too, But of course praying for US first and foremost.  Bless us first as a couple and them maybe them if its ""His will""

....I just feel so evil, So bad about even feeling this hatred and annoyance and all this emotions, that I just can't sleep. I cannot have peace with myself. The person I least expected to have problems is giving me all the stress and grief... I just don't know how long I can go on with this.

How she was praying for us  AND (in a casual what-I&#39;m-gonna-say-next-is-not-as-important-so-I-passingly- say-it) was praying for themselves too, But of course praying for US first and foremost.  Bless us first as a couple and them maybe them if its &quot;His will&quot;</p>

<p>....I just feel so evil, So bad about even feeling this hatred and annoyance and all this emotions, that I just can&#39;t sleep. I cannot have peace with myself. The person I least expected to have problems is giving me all the stress and grief... I just don&#39;t know how long I can go on with this. </p>

<p>Thank you for letting this off my chest. I just needed to let it out so I can hopefully, finally go to bed and have a bit of this baggage off me,</p>

I'm 31, and my husband and I have been married for a while but just started trying last summer. This whole process has been incredibly frustrating, heartbreaking. I'm doing okay now but I'm really stuck on trying to decide my next steps. I do have an appointment with my Ob/Gyn to discuss this next week, but I guess I'm just trying to think ahead.

After my second loss, I started on Prometrium (progesterone) supplements after ovulation for presumed luteal phase defect, as my luteal phase was only 10 days with very very light periods. Obviously that didn't work. 

I've had some more blood work drawn now, my thyroid is normal, clotting time is normal, and I do not have antiphospholipid syndrome. So there goes a bunch of ""fixable"" things to blame for the repeated losses. I'm still waiting on a karyotype. I also had a transvaginal ultrasound and that was normal.

To make all this a bit more complicated, I'm moving across the country in a few weeks so will be needing to look for a new Ob/Gyn, and probably won't have time to get done much more testing before I go (like if my OB recommended an endometrial biopsy or anything like that).

It's hard to stop my brain from jumping to conclusions. I keep thinking about how even with the progesterone supplements my period is very light, perhaps I could need an estrogen supplement too? I've started on some extra vitamins/supplements (vitamin C, co-q 10, & L-arginine in addition to the prenatal, vitamin D, and omega-3s I was already taking) now as well, because I figure, it can't make things worse than they already are...

I&#39;ve started on some extra vitamins/supplements (vitamin C, co-q 10, &amp; L-arginine in addition to the prenatal, vitamin D, and omega-3s I was already taking) now as well, because I figure, it can&#39;t make things worse than they already are... </p>

<p>So after all that rambling I guess I just wanted to share. Maybe hear if anyone here has gone through something similar. Reading the posts here is really helping me. &lt;3</p>

&#x200B;

I don't really have a question as such, just wanted to share my story, and start by saying the support in this community is amazing, and even just reading through everyones posts, you feel like you aren't alone - so thank you all so much for that!

&#x200B;

I lost my baby 4 weeks ago, I was 22 weeks when I had to deliver him. He had hydrops and we still haven't had any answers yet, just that we know it wasn't caused by Down's, Edward's or Patau's syndrome. 

&#x200B;

He had a slightly higher than average NT at 12 weeks, we got private tests done to rule out the chromosomal disorders. These came back as extremely low risk, so I relaxed and got on with the pregnancy. Come the 20 week scan and he had a lot of fluid under his skin, and some in his abdomen I think, he also wasn't moving. I had amnio at this point and was told that the outlook was bleak. We got a second opinion at a different hospital and they told us that it was highly likely his heart would stop in the coming weeks.

&#x200B;

We made the extremely difficult decision to terminate the pregnancy, and I had to deliver him that weekend. I got to hold him, and take some photos with him which I'll treasure forever.

&#x200B;

Now we're waiting for results from the post mortem, and it's only been 4 weeks, but I feel like I'm waiting forever. I want answers and I want to try again. We're just so upset that this happened to us, we're both young and healthy and this was our first pregnancy, but reading through posts on this subreddit helps me realise I'm not alone, and my heart goes out to every single one of you!

Had my first MMC last month (took miso to complete it), and at first DH and I decided to wait until after the summer to TTC again, but now we're starting to get baby crazy again and want to try sooner. I am terrified. So many 'what ifs' are running through my head. What if it happens again? What if it happens again but further along? What if I ruin the pregnancy for myself by being so scared during the whole thing?

My question(s) here is; 

What do you guys tell yourself to make you less scared?
How do you get yourself away from the what ifs? How do you become more positive?

I want to enjoy pregnancy, and I know I'll naturally be nervous, but I don't want to be overly neurotic and be miserable the whole time.

This is almost a carbon copy of the MC I had last year.

This time basically everyone agrees that it doesn't look good, though they want to do another HCG draw and actually see the numbers going down before taking any action. I'll do that tomorrow, and if HCG is lower than the last one I could have misoprostol tomorrow. Or I could wait till Monday and have a D&C. If HCG is not decreasing, I may have to wait and keep testing or wait for another ultrasound.

So sorry to post here and bother you with this, but I figured I might have better luck getting advice from people who are further out from their loss. Long story short, I had a MMC and a d&c 4 weeks ago (was 10 weeks at the time). My recovery has been absolutely brutal in terms of bleeding. I will spare you the details, except to say that it had stopped about 10 days ago and I thought I was in the clear.

Then, yesterday I started bleeding bright red blood. I had been feeling PMS symptoms for the couple days before (emotional, weepy, bloated), spotting, and watched my HCG get fainter on my test strips, so I was hoping this was finally my period since it had been 4 weeks since the surgery.

Today, I passed what I \*know\* is placental tissue. It is about the size of a quarter. I had this same complication after my son's birth 5 years ago - retained placental fragments - which I only realized when I started passing the actual tissue 6 weeks after the birth. I had to have a d&c at that time.

I am so, so pissed about this happening again. I warned the doctor doing the surgery that this had happened to me before, I told my midwife at the follow up that I was terrified it was happening again because of my crazy bleeding, and everyone dismissed my concerns.

I called a high risk Obgyn and will be seen next Tuesday but...anyone else ever go through this and manage to avoid another surgery? I'm scared of having another d&c, desperate to start TTC, and just feeling so mad at the universe right now...

&#x200B;

\*Update. New Obgyn found tons of ""debris"" and a retained placental fragment still attached to the back of my uterus. He was stunned at the amount remaining. I managed to get through a manual d and c in the office with just motrin and he dislodged the fragment successfully. Painful beyond words while it was happening but it seems like they got everything and I was glad to avoid another round of anesthia.
