I'm hoping everybody is doing better today than they were yesterday - one foot in front of the other, right? It has gotten a lot easier to find the happiness in my day-to-day over the last 5 months. I can't believe it has been that long. Every other day or so I still find myself saying, ""I would be (in the case of today) 7 months along..."" This seems to happen a lot when I'm lying in bed at night unable to fall asleep. I lay on my side and think how I wouldn't be able to curl in such a tiny ball if I was still pregnant. I know it doesn't help me one bit to think that way, but try as I might I can't prevent ALL of my sad thoughts from coming out on occasion....

Prior to our MMC we had been TTC for about 9 months, but really only had 5 cycles that we were able to *actually* TTC (surgery for me, or DH out of town...those type of things). The week before we got our BFP we had visited our OB/GYN for some perspective and a plan for the future. DH had a semen analysis done and that came back normal and we had planned on my starting Clomid within the next month, but having the BFP stopped us from (obviously) needing to do that. 

Now I'm 5 months out from the MMC and we've set a tentative date of October (my 32nd Birthday) to head back to the doctor to try the Clomid route if we're still without another BFP by that point. 

Are we jumping the gun here? Should we wait longer than that? I hear from friends who've had MC's and one of them said it took her another 7 months after for her to get pregnant again, but I guess my hangup is that it did take 9 months the first time and I'm so scared it'll take that long (or longer) again.

What has y'alls plan of action been in regards to this? Surely I can't be the only one already bordering on panic every time my period starts back each month...

I've been taking Metformin (500 2x/day) to regulate my PCOS and it seems to help kind of? And the last 2 months I've been using Wondfo/generic ovulation tests. This month I started using the tests daily, beginning a few days after my period ended. The last period (Aug 3rd) was the first ""normal"" period I've had in months (heavy flow for a few days, lasted ~5 days total). The 2-3 cycles prior weren't as late as usual, but were extremely light flow and I don't know if they were even real periods. At that time I was on 500 mg 1x/day. The ""real"" period came after a month of increasing Metformin to 500 2x/day. 

I have yet to get a ""positive"" result from my daily ovulation tests, though I've had the test line go from nothing to really light, to a little more solid, and then back to light then nothing. But never the solid, dark line that indicates ""positive"" for ovulation. However, I'm not great about testing first thing in the morning. I end up testing when I get off work around 5:30 pm. I haven't noticed much difference between the 1st morning testing or later in the day. 

Does anyone have recommendations regarding the ovulation tests? Could I be missing a ""positive"" result by not testing 1st thing in the morning? Does it mean anything that I get light lines then nothing? 

My regular doctor gave us a referral to a fertility specialist, but I'm dragging my feet. I wanted to try the ovulation testing w/ Metformin for awhile first. But I'm getting frustrated with not seeing results and/or not understanding the results I get.

I just turned 32 and my husband and I are trying for our second child-- first living child-- after a TFMR at 24 weeks.  We found out at our 20-week scan that our baby had only one artery in his umbilical cord, went for a level-2 ultrasound a few days later which found a heart defect, excess amniotic fluid from a swallowing problem, and some unusual physical features.  We had an amniocentesis and got the results at 23w5d.  Baby had DiGeorge Syndrome, aka 22q11.2 deletion syndrome, which is a completely random genetic mutation that's not related to the age or health of the parents.  

We were very concerned, especially because many children with this disease are not detected until well after birth, but our little boy was already showing physical symptoms at 20 weeks gestation.  We just didn't want to subject our child to a life of physical and mental anguish, and made the absolutely horrible decision to terminate.  I would never wish this situation on my worst enemy, but it happened to us, we became a statistic.  I never in my life thought I would ever terminate a pregnancy for any reason, but now am the wiser.  No one can ever understand what it's like to be in that position until they've been there.

So it will be two weeks tomorrow that we went through labor and delivered our peacefully sleeping baby boy, who we gave a name that we loved.  We took pictures, we have his footprints, and we will soon have his ashes to keep forever.  We loved him so much.

I am waiting for my lochia to stop and hoping to get my fertility back soon.  I have been charting for years, to avoid pregnancy naturally, until we conceived on our second cycle trying for our first pregnancy.  I am hoping that my body gets back to its normal self, though I don't have the most regular cycles, and I'm afraid that my post-pregnancy body will be confused or that the grief we are experiencing will cause my body to not ovulate for a long time.  Only time will tell so I have to be patient.  I see my doctor on Tuesday for my first postpartum visit and am hoping to get the go-ahead to resume our normal life and try for another baby soon.  

We are hoping to eventually have at least 2 children but I am 32 and now regretting that we waited this long and praying that we don't end up heartbroken and childless.  Or I guess we'll just be the rich aunt and uncle or we'll adopt...

Any words of wisdom regarding the physical or mental aspects of this process of recovering from a TFMR or stillbirth and moving on to trying for another after this are welcome.  It is very scary to realize that having a healthy baby is not as easy as it seems, from conceiving in the first place, to the chances of losing that child or of having a child with serious physical and/or mental problems.  I never knew that trying to have a family could be such an uncertain process.

Anyway, I think we will take a leap of faith and hope for the best, hope that lightning doesn't strike twice, and hope that my body cooperates and we can have a healthy little sibling for our baby boy in heaven very soon.",t2_jh5ia,False,,0,False,Intro (TW- TFMR),[],r/ttcafterloss,False,0,intro,0,,,False,t3_4zivpj,False,dark,0.94,,public,12,0,{},,,False,[],,False,False,,{},Intro,False,12,,False,self,False,,[],{},,True,,1472165623.0,text,0,,,text,self.ttcafterloss,True,"<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=""md""><p>Hi all, I&#39;m (unfortunately?) joining you in TTCAfterLoss.  I just turned 32 and my husband and I are trying for our second child-- first living child-- after a TFMR at 24 weeks.  We found out at our 20-week scan that our baby had only one artery in his umbilical cord, went for a level-2 ultrasound a few days later which found a heart defect, excess amniotic fluid from a swallowing problem, and some unusual physical features.  We had an amniocentesis and got the results at 23w5d.  Baby had DiGeorge Syndrome, aka 22q11.2 deletion syndrome, which is a completely random genetic mutation that&#39;s not related to the age or health of the parents.  </p>

<p>We were very concerned, especially because many children with this disease are not detected until well after birth, but our little boy was already showing physical symptoms at 20 weeks gestation.  We just didn&#39;t want to subject our child to a life of physical and mental anguish, and made the absolutely horrible decision to terminate.

And for the 2nd time, I'm not even pregnant again while remembering our baby and being torn apart by the due date. Oh and I am at my job, which I don't even like much anymore...and in pain from knee surgery. AND - we just canceled Europe. :(  Yay for today?

If that isn't enough, my friend had her baby boy 2 days ago. And I have 2 other really good friends who are due in the next 3 weeks.

But if that isn't enough, either...lets just do a rundown of my 2016 so far:

* January: Pregnant and so excited and scared
* February: Miscarriage and D&C
* March: CP
* April: Go under contract on our ""dream home"" ...my job makes that impossible and we have to back out on the house, losing the house and money. (Decide to go to Europe for a vacation since no baby and no house)
* May-June: See my RE multiple times for testing...find no reason...but find out I likely can't get pregnant on my own again. Argh.
* July: Tear my stupid ACL and have surgery. Now I can't play softball or cycle, help on our house remodeling, drive, walk, etc...and am in pain.  Oh and got offered/accepted a new job...but then lost THAT due to a crazy manager (I think I dodged a bullet here but still).
* August (so far): Cancel our Europe trip due to my knee. :( Work and PT and not much else. And now it's my EDD.

I honestly can't catch a break, it seems. These things just keep piling on and while some don't have to do with my pregnancy loss, they are losses and I just feel like I can't win. 

We talked just last week in my local support group about not letting TTC rule your life and getting out there and doing things. One girl in our group wasn't leaving her house or signing up for things she loved due to ttc. Me on the other hand -- I started cycling tons, was back to playing softball multiple times a week, was working on our house, and was planning this amazing trip with my husband. We decided to take a leap and make a big move/buy another house...everything! I was purposely going out and living life, doing the things I wanted to do/love...and life has been beating me down at every corner. No baby, no new house, no new job, no sports/etc, no vacation...AND top it off with knee surgery. 

I'm at a point where I'm not even sure how to handle my feelings. I just feel so down all the time. About so many aspects. And people can say ""Oh well try to switch things up""...well, I've been trying. See where that has gotten me?

AND THEN...my husband and I just don't relate well about our losses. He wants to ""fix me"", I swear. I can't be FIXED. And he hates to see me sad, so he just wants to not talk about it or he literally tells me ""don't be sad"". Umm that doesn't work. He is sad, too, I know it -- but doesn't express it almost ever, so that hurts me too. I feel alone. And when I just need hugs and cuddles and to cry, he is wanting to fix things. It's so hard to relate and it makes things worse. 

I know changing the year is arbitrary...but I am so over 2016.  In 2015 I had my first MC and I just wanted the year to end. I found out I was pregnant again in December and was so looking forward to 2016. But this year has piled shit on the entire time and I am over it. But I also can't say ""bring on 2017"" anymore, like it's gonna HELP anything. So, I know its arbitrary, but Fuck 2016. 

Ahhhhhhhhhhhh. I AM SO OVER IT ALL.

First, I'll try and give a short synopsis of my situation.  I'm 31, and after trying unsuccessfully to conceive naturally for 17 months, I finally saw on OBGYN.  He noted cysts on my ovaries and some insulin resistance, so I started Metformin in May and Clomid for my June cycle.  In early July, I got a positive HPT (and then about 30 more over the next several weeks) and we were elated.  I went for my first prenatal appointment at about our weeks and there was no heartbeat.  HCG tests over the next 48 hours went from 81k to 89k, so I was told I was or would miscarry.

I totally freaked out and had a lot of trouble coping.  I needed to get the baby (or embryo or whatever) out ASAP, so I had a D&E on Friday the 12th.

As of now, I'm still cramping and spotting a little bit and am just generally miserable, but I also am having a weird sensation when I urinate.

- Why does it feel weird when I pee?
- Should I still be concerned about the cramping and spotting?
- I'm EXHAUSTED all the time.  Depression?  Something else?
- When can we start trying again?
- Will I use Clomid again?
- Is there anything within my possible control that I can do to make sure we get pregnant again and that I don't go through this devastation?

I had a D&C on April 20, 2016. My cycles that followed were:

I've been testing and had a blood test four days ago, which came back negative. I truly thought I was pregnant, as I was having many symptoms I had with my first pregnancy. 

I was talking to someone over the weekend who had a similar experience, and she ended up having some issues that she didn't know about after her d&c, which prevented her from getting pregnant.

All of this is leading to my question. Should I go see my doctor about my irregular cycles, or just wait? I don't want to waste his time, but I'm becoming impatient.

I had to understand that he went through the same pain as I did, he might not show it but we both lost someone we had so many dreams and late night conversations about. 
Recently I applied for a job and ended up getting it a week later. For me whatever the job I'm extremely excited, mostly to get out of the house but also contributing an income to the household. 
Silly me, trying to share the excitement with my family who can never be happy with anything.

We realized it became too much for us 6 months in.  It wasn't right for us to start out our marriage with distance, so I moved everything and closed the distance. My parents weren't happy about that but hey, I'm a married woman and what I do is my business.
Long story short, my mother keeps on trying to get me to start school here, which I don't want to. She basically stated that I ruined my life getting married and moving.

It felt like a surreal dream, however over those intervening three weeks, I got symptoms and began to believe that it was real. Unfortunately, on Tuesday of this week I started to have some light spotting. This picked up on Wednesday. Finally on Thursday, with bright red bleeding. I was seen by my doctor and had a transvaginal u/s. This showed an ""inevitable miscarriage."" I ended up taking misoprostol, because I felt so powerless in the situation, and I'm a resident physician so I have an absurd schedule. To top off the terrible week, my husband is out of the country on a business trip, so it's me and the cats. Today, the bleeding is lightening up.

We are hopeful that at least now we know it is possible to get pregnant which is a big step, and we are so grateful that it is possible. I'm hoping we will be trying again soon. 

Thank you to the wonderful community here in this sub-reddit, reading your posts has given me significant support and made me feel less alone. Lots of love to you all.

Told my husband, ugly cry and all. Called my doctor and ordered the blood test. The next day I called and sure enough my blood test was positive!

I was a poster here not too long ago, following my first miscarriage and I received some great advice and support and I'm hoping to receive some advice on how to support my SIL who is having difficulty moving forward. 

My SIL has suffered 4 miscarriages between October 2015 and June 2016. Her first miscarriage was a chemical pregnancy, as were her third and fourth. Her 2nd miscarriage happened just shy of 11 weeks. 

My husband and I had a miscarriage in February 2016, and conceived again the following cycle. We are now 21+ 3. 

This is a difficult situation for all because while we are overjoyed, we are also sad because we want my SIL to get pregnant and to feel better and make peace with what has happened, and we would like for her to be involved in our child's life. But she is detached and avoidant about our pregnancy. 

We understood and have given her space, and were conscious about not discussing it with her or around her. She has known for 16 weeks now, and we were hoping that she would be feeling better but she seems to have fallen down further. 

We suspect that she might be suffering from PTSD, because she is avoidant of pretty much all pregnancies and she keeps reliving the due date for each lost pregnancy. 

We don't want to have the relationship damaged, but I am looking for ways to be able to support her through this in a way that can foster a more positive relationship since she essentially avoids me in every way possible (which isn't hard because we live across the country from each other). 

Any insight and advice on how to navigate this would be appreciated.

The baby had stopped developing around 6.5 weeks. It was a devastating experience for us both, especially considering we had such an easy pregnancy with our daughter the first time around and took it for granted things would probably be ok.  I opted for the misoprostol which had me bleeding heavily off and on for weeks after. It took a long time to return to normal.

After several months we got another positive pregnancy test in July. We were optimistic, but both very reserved about this pregnancy understandably. I have been very nervous waiting for the first appointment scheduled for 9 weeks, but tried my best to put it in the back of mind so as not to focus on it. I had all the classic pregnancy symptoms and could even feel some of the pressure of my uterus growing. I was cautiously optimistic.

Yesterday we finally went in for our first appointment at 9 weeks. As soon as it was time for the scan I began to tremble and cry as the memories of the last terrible experience came rushing back. The doctor and husband were wonderful in trying to comfort me.  I couldn't see the monitor during the scan. The doctor said she could see the baby in there... She didn't say anything again for a few moments. My heart was pounding. Then she finally sighed and said those words I never hoped to hear again, ""I'm sorry, I don't see a heartbeat."" The appointment for was exactly 9 weeks and the baby measured exactly 9 weeks in size. I had just lost it, maybe even that morning.

We opted for a D&C this time and I went into surgery that evening. So far the bleeding and pain has been minimal compared to last time, though I am convinced I retained some tissue previously. We had the fetal tissue sent to the lab for testing and I will be getting some additional bloodwork done this time around. I am getting much better care from this doctor than the other I saw previously which has made a huge difference.

Last October I found out I was pregnant after our first month trying. It was crazy- every doctor I ever saw told me that I would likely have fertility issues and I was fully prepared to dig in and patiently take whatever steps I needed to. So imagine my surprise when, on our 4 year wedding anniversary, to find out that we were having twins. It was a shock to say the least. I had mixed emotions about it to be honest. I was scared. It certainly wasn't the plan I had for us- I was overwhelmed just imagining how our life would be with two. Then, as time went on and my pregnancy progressed, I let myself get excited. Everyone said how they would have a best friend for life, and that being a twin parent was special. Crazy hard, but incredible. And so we got comfortable. We found out they were girls. We picked out names and bought two cribs. 

On May 7th, I went in to the emergency room with extremely high blood pressure. I had severe pre-eclampsia. At 34 weeks, they were going to induce me. On May 10th, Nora Lux and Lena Rose were born via C-section. They were perfect. Lena scored a 9 on her APGAR and Nora was a 7. They went up to the NICU and I couldn't go see them because I was on magnesium for the pre-e. Later that night we got a call from the NICU that something was wrong with Lena, without going into too much detail, she had an infection and was not responding to antibiotics. The nurses helped me out of bed and we went up to see her but when we got up there the doctors made it seem like she was doing better so we went back down to the room. Early the next morning they called us again and told us that we should come up and hold her. Lena Rose died in my arms 26 hours after she was born. 

Nora is home and doing well now. To say life has been hard would be an understatement. How do you grieve a child at the same time you want to celebrate one? Every thing Nora does is a reminder that Lena is not there, too. I never knew that you could literally feel your heart breaking. You go from one special club of being a twin mom to another special club of being a mother of loss. Some days I feel so lost in my own emotions.

My husband and I have decided to try again. Nora was not supposed to be an only child. I'm scared of being pregnant again. No baby will ever replace Lena. I'm scared that it will be twins again- and I'm scared that it won't. I wonder how I'll feel if its a boy when I was supposed to have two girls. There are so many worries when I want to be excited.

90,2048,confidence,<praw.reddit.Reddit object at 0x7f12a630cd90>,,ttcafterloss,"Hi ladies, I'm here to give my introduction to a group I just never thought I'd be a part of, but am now so happy that it exists. 

My husband and I have a happy, healthy two year old son. My pregnancy was a surprise; I was on birth control. We weren't married or even engaged at the time, and had been on the fence about ever having kids in the future - we could see the appeal of both sides, and just never had a reason to officially decide either way. Then, I got pregnant. Once we made the decision to continue the pregnancy, we never looked back and have been so happy with where our life has taken us. The pregnancy was perfect, easy, no complications, and I delivered a healthy full term boy at 40 weeks and 4 days. Life is good. 

This past winter, we decided to casually try for #2 and I had my IUD removed. Again, we were kind of on the fence for another, but ultimately made the decision that we didn't want our son to be an only child. We didn't track anything, periods or sex. I wound up making the decision to eat better and get more active, and lost 50 lbs while getting in the best shape of my life. I was enjoying my new fitness level and healthy body, and then boom - found out I was pregnant in late June. 

I was initially somewhat depressed about being pregnant, which my husband understood. It took about a week to really get back into pregnancy mode and being excited. Since I wasn't tracking anything g, I had no idea about my last period. I just couldn't remember. My OB made a ballpark guess for my first ultrasound and said if it was early, no big deal. Husband and I show up for our first appointment, and surprise, it's identical twins! What a ""holy shit"" moment. They estimated I was around six weeks, and two heartbeats were present. Doc wanted me back in two weeks for a better dating ultrasound. I was terrified, and scared, but husband was excited. Twins run in my family, and I was the first one to ""carry on"" the lineage for my generation. 

In those two weeks between ultrasounds, I got really, really excited about having twins. Terrified still, but excited to be a part of an exclusive club. I bonded and instantly felt that they were girls. I had the same weird intuition with my first pregnancy, that turned out to be correct. Of course this could just be coincidence, but I still bonded with what I believed to be twin girls. Two weeks went by and I felt OK. Pregnant, tired, nausea all the time. Nothing changed. 

Next ultrasound, and I'll never forget the sonographer when she just said, ""oh..."" And I just knew. No heartbeats. I was devastated. Luckily my husband was there with me. It was so terrible, that moment of everything crashing down. I had no symptoms of a miscarriage at all, and had been vomiting as per my normal nausea that very morning. I was so completely shocked. I made the decision to have a D&C. 

My procedure was uneventful, medically speaking. Doctors were all compassionate and understanding. Emotionally it was horrible. I was a mess when I was brought into the OR. The anesthesiologist was great and I was asleep almost immediately. My pathology was normal. 

I've had no complications and things have been going well in my recovery period. Every day gets a bit easier, but some days just suck. I had my first post-op appointment yesterday and was in the sam room as I was when discussing the miscarriage, so I was pretty emotional. My husband was with me so that helped. 

I was give a clean bill of health and the go-ahead to start trying again. Doc recommended waiting one cycle for dating purposes, but ultimately said if I get pregnant this cycle it means my body is ready as there is no research that shows any disadvantages to getting pregnant immediately. He said whatever I want to do is ok. My husband and I agreed to just let things happen and if it happens this cycle ok, but if not that's ok too and we can try more precise tracking next cycle.

My emotions have been such a whirlwind, from being somewhat sad about being pregnant at first, to getting excited, to being terrified about twins, to being happy, and now dealing with loss. I'm also angry that my first, accidental, pregnancy was such a breeze, and now here I am in the best shape of my life, making an informed decision to try to get pregnant, and I miscarry. It just seems so cruel and backwards. I know my story is has some of those obnoxious ""wasn't even trying to get pregnant"" parts to it, and I can totally understand how frustrating that is to those struggling with TTC, but it doesn't mean I didn't come to love being pregnant with twins. I realize now how badly I did want it, even if it took an emotional roller coaster to figure it out. I'm now trying to get back to where I was before I learned I was pregnant again, and I know I can't. Instead, I'm trying to be sensible and learn what I can from this recovery process and be strong going into TTC again. 

Thanks for reading my story. I just never thought I'd have a miscarriage, despite how naive that sounds. I'm 35, so I'm terrified of how I'll feel during the next subsequent pregnancy, and I'm worried the fear of another miscarriage will be overbearing. My age makes me feel like I waited too long. I just hate being on this side of things. 

My question being, has anyone else made the decision to let things happen immediately after a D&C/miscarriage, aka not waiting a full cycle? I enjoy the closeness and intimacy, and kind of feel like whatever happens is just meant to happen. I'm not obsessed with getting pregnant immediately, more along the lines of just letting whatever is meant to be take its course.

I'm 31, starting TTC in February and got very lucky that first time, but then had a miscarriage at 9 weeks in April. Have been trying again for 3 cycles now (as long as has been possible since getting my period back after my D&C).

I'm definitely not the most unlucky of people nor have I had an especially frustrating journey so far compared to many folks out there. But you know how it is - some days ""count your blessings"" still gets entirely overwhelmed and crushed by just feeling like nothing will go your way. 

I've definitely come up against the feeling that everyone but me in our lives is pregnant or has a baby, that we started talking about this long before anyone else but couldn't try right away and now it seems so unfair that ""everyone"" else got there first, that that one friend who ""never wanted kids"" changed her mind and got pregnant immediately and everything went just peachy keen smooth for her, and that even when I want to be (and am!) happy for pregnant friends I also just get more sad for me. Plus being even more anxious after losing the first pregnancy that we'll get unlucky in that regard again, and having lost trust in my body to do what I want it to. It's a big messy stew of not-very-comfortable feelings.

So that's me, but I know I should still be optimistic and shy away from the pity party given that it hasn't been that long, really, in the great scheme of things. I'm just a few days into this cycle's TWW now, and I seem to get a little more neurotic about it every month, so I thought I'd come spend some time here and try to maybe get some perspective as well as encouragement. 

Thanks for reading and letting me join in around here!
