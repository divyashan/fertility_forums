I pushed for some preliminary testing, and I really had to push. My OB was strongly against it, citing the fact that data shows there is not a high likelihood of finding physiological programs after two losses (and/or finding a level that's ""high"" per lab-specified ranges but is not actually related to miscarriage and is a false positive). It increases greatly after three, though. 

I already know my TSH level is normal, but she did write me a prescription for prolactin testing. I would really like to look at progesterone levels, but her position is that progesterone supplementation is not clinically shown to decrease miscarriage. Despite her position, she wrote me an order for progesterone testing as well. She counseled that in all likelihood, this testing will not reveal anything helpful. 

In summary, she strongly suggests I try for another pregnancy with the hope that it is a healthy one. If we should experience another loss, that would give more clinical evidence to do testing. 

I'm really torn. The blood work will mean two additional months of waiting on top of the one month we already know we want to wait to allow my cycle to normalize. I don't know if I want to add that time on the off-chance testing will reveal an issue -- or if we should try again with the knowledge that statistically speaking, we are still highly likely to have a healthy pregnancy. 

Obviously this is a discussion my husband and I are having, but I'd love to hear how some of you may have approached similar situations.

Background: 1 MMC in January 2016 at 5 weeks, 1 MC end of June 2016 at 12 weeks (though they think it happened at 8). I had to wait to TTC again for awhile, as there was residual tissue they needed to remove. Currently on cycle 5 of full-time TTC again.

My Dr prescribed Sterephene, which I took days 2 - 7. Went in CD 8 and had 4 follicles over 10mm. Went in today (CD 11), and I had 1 follicle at 17mm, 1 at 13mm, and 3 around the 10mm mark. I'm worried that seems low - was hoping for some better results after being on the medication to increase the number of follicles and the sizes are. I was given Ovidrel and am waiting for a call on when I should take it (a bit nervous about giving myself a shot - I have no issues with needles, but it'll be weird).

Not totally sure what my question is, but wanted to see if anyone else thought the number of follicles as low, or the sizes were low. I usually ovulate CD 16, so there's still time (depending when I'm told to take the shot) for them to grow, but the technician didn't think the 13mm would grow in time.

6,2048,confidence,<praw.reddit.Reddit object at 0x7f12a630cd90>,,ttcafterloss,"Yesterday I should have been celebrating one month with my newborn baby girl.  I should be home on maternity leave enjoying all of the ups and downs of being a first time mom.  I should have a sleeping baby next to me while I post obnoxious photos to Instagram.  Instead - I have been thrust into the category of a ""bereaved mother"" - something that no one ever expects and no one should ever have to experience.

On October 25th Addison was born silently into this world.  She was born far too early at 23 weeks gestation.  The one thing that, as a woman, my body is supposed to be good at is growing and nurturing a baby.  My body failed me, and Addison, in this regard.  They called it an Incompetent Cervix, something that cannot be diagnosed before it occurs.  Incompetent?  Are you fucking kidding me?  That's what you're going to call me right after I lost my baby? (yes, I know they're not actually calling me that, but it sure felt that way). That term makes it sound like I'm to blame - which is exactly how I feel sometimes.  I know, I know... My brain knows that it's not my fault, but my heart feels differently.

I remember every detail of October 25th.  I was telling my mom the other day how crazy it is that the memories you really want to keep - your wedding, birthdays, graduations, etc. - are so easily forgotten.  But not October 25th.  I can tell you verbatim what the doctors said to us, the look on my husband's face as he heard the news, Addison's tiny hand that lay outside the blanket when the nurse handed her to me.  Everything.  I can vividly remember the feeling of leaving the hospital empty.  You're not supposed to leave the hospital without your baby - I was wheeled out broken and devastated.

I feel like we weren't able to fully grieve our loss of Addison until months later.  After October 25th I bled for seven straight weeks.  Something that is not uncommon or common.  I didn't want to go back and see my doctor as I knew I would step into that office and be surrounded by happily pregnant women.  When I did go back it turned out that my hemoglobin was down to 6.8 (women are supposed to be up towards 13) and I was told to go to the ER.  I went - they transfused me with blood and iron and scheduled me for a D&C the next day where I hemorrhaged during the procedure and needed more blood.  A week later, I hemorrhaged again - back to the ER we went.  This time I needed an emergency D&C bedside in the ER while they transfused me with two units of blood.  No drugs, no anesthesia - how they do it in 3rd world countries according to the doctor.  The bleeding was so severe I went back down to a hemoglobin level of 6.5 (I arrived with 8.5 an hour earlier).  If he couldn't get the bleeding to stop soon I would need an emergency hysterectomy.  What?  Are you kidding? FUCK that.  I told everyone who would listen that I was only 30 and there had to be another solution.  Thankfully an extremely high dose of progesterone got the bleeding under control.  It wasn't until we got home after our final trip to the ER that we felt like we could grieve Addison the way we needed to - a process that I'm not sure will ever end.

Everyone means well -  but that doesn't mean they have the right things to say because there is NO right thing to say.  Nothing helps, nothing makes me feel better, nothing fills the emptiness I have inside of me.  To those who tell me that time heals all wounds - you (thankfully) haven't gone through a loss like this.  Time will not heal me.  To those who tell me that I can have more children - I don't want more children, I want Addison.  I want to hear her laugh and smile.  I want to watch her learn and grow.  I want the child that was stolen from me.  To those who say it gets easier - it doesn't.  It simply does not get easier.  I refuse to believe that.  Nothing about this is easy or will ever be easy.  I can only believe that we get stronger from this.

I miscarried earlier this week, was only 5w 3d, so maybe chemical pregnancy? Although I did pass a clot that could have been a gestational sac so who knows. 

Anyway, for that pregnancy I had been trying for a few months just based on Ovia's predicted ovulation date, but since my periods were all over the place I tried some OPKs and it worked (until the loss). 

Anyway, and I'm a little embarrassed to admit it, I have no idea how to go about charting (what exactly are you charting?)...  is it just body temp? How do you get BBT? (Basal Body Temp?). I thought just a temp reading when I wake up, but I saw some people temp vaginally? I didn't know that was a thing.  

Anything else I should be charting? 

What other things have you all considered or done to promote fertility to try to get the baby to ""stick"", so to speak? I've heard of different vitamins, aspirin, etc.

What are your favorite apps for charting/tracking?

I've been lurking in this sub since my first loss in December 2015. It was my first pregnancy, and I found out just two weeks after my husband deployed. HCG was bouncing all over the place, and we were hoping it wasn't ectopic. Woke up with cramps in the middle of the night, drove myself to the ER, and the ultrasound tech found a mass in my right tube. That pregnancy was successfully treated with one round of methotrexate. Devastating to handle by myself. 

I got pregnant again a few weeks after my husband came home from deployment in May 2016, and we were cautiously optimistic. What were the odds of an ectopic and a miscarriage back to back? Early scans looked good, everything was in the right place, and we told our families the good news. Had no idea anything was wrong until I went in for a 10 week ultrasound, to discover the baby stopped growing at 7 weeks, just after the last checkup. It was a MMC, and I took cytotec to miscarry at home. 

Third loss was today. After 7 months of trying and a couple days of positive pregnancy tests, I started bleeding. Went to the doctor's to get it checked out, and they suspect a chemical pregnancy. At least I hadn't let myself get excited about this one. The only thing I associate a positive pregnancy test with is fear, pain, and disappointment. Anyone else feel the same way? 

I just don't know what to do anymore. I'm 26 years old, super healthy (was a collegiate athlete), and we have had 3 losses in 18 months. Do I insist on an appointment with an RE?

I'm 33, husband is 37, TTC since Aug 2015.  I have unexplained ovulation issues, regular periods but don't seem to do it on my own. Started fertility treatments Aug 2016 and conceived with letrozole + trigger + IUI in November.  Unfortunately the fetus stopped growing around 6 weeks, which I found out right around the holidays.  That was really hard, I still don't know how I managed to be normal but I think... wine.   

I had a D&C early January, one of the silver linings I could find was that I could go back to playing soccer.  Which I stopped doing when I found out I was pregnant.  I've been playing several times a week since I was  a kid, I love it so much.  In my first game back (5 days post D&C), I freaking broke my fibula in 3 places.  Worst injury I've ever had.  I ended up needing surgery, and taking most of January off work to recover from it.  It was such an interesting juxtaposition of the two events, a miscarriage barely any one knew about and then this very obvious injury.  People brought flowers, food, dropped by for visits.  It was strange but also comforting to have something so tangible to focus on instead with a clear recovery path.

I just started letrozole again and will likely have an IUI next week.  I'm cautiously hopeful, but so worried about being gutted by another unsuccessful cycle and/or another loss.  I feel surrounded by babies, pregnancy, it cannot be escaped in my workplace or my friend group and I hate that I now hate it.  I hate that one of the shows I like (Girls) has an unplanned pregnancy story line... This week she held up a lentil to represent the size of her baby and I screamed ""Not all lentils end in babies!"".  Day 3 of meds MAY have me emotional.

This group has been very comforting to me as I gear up to TTC again, with all that entails.  My lady friend group is divided into people who want to get pregnant and then do, and people who are still on tinder.  So it's nice to have some space where I know folks more readily understand.  XOXOXO to all.

<p>I&#39;m 33, husband is 37, TTC since Aug 2015.  I have unexplained ovulation issues, regular periods but don&#39;t seem to do it on my own. Started fertility treatments Aug 2016 and conceived with letrozole + trigger + IUI in November.  Unfortunately the fetus stopped growing around 6 weeks, which I found out right around the holidays.  That was really hard, I still don&#39;t know how I managed to be normal but I think... wine.   </p>

<p>I had a D&amp;C early January, one of the silver linings I could find was that I could go back to playing soccer.  Which I stopped doing when I found out I was pregnant.  I&#39;ve been playing several times a week since I was  a kid, I love it so much.  In my first game back (5 days post D&amp;C), I freaking broke my fibula in 3 places.  Worst injury I&#39;ve ever had.  I ended up needing surgery, and taking most of January off work to recover from it.  It was such an interesting juxtaposition of the two events, a miscarriage barely any one knew about and then this very obvious injury.  People brought flowers, food, dropped by for visits.

Having to call my work to take time off last minute, so of course I had to tell them what happened. Because everyone knew I was pregnant. I walked around excited, telling everyone, because at 15 weeks, I was safe. 

At 10 weeks, finding out I was pregnant with twins, but 1 had no heartbeat and a large cystic hygroma. I dealt with that, and still remained positive for the health of the other baby. I sat for weeks waiting for the NIPT results, even after finding out they messed up and had to rerun it. Genetics came back great. Baby looked great on the 12 week ultrasound. 

I heard her heartbeat with my home doppler just 2 days ago.

There were no symptoms, no bleeding, no cramping. I still had all my pregnancy symptoms. But somehow I just knew. Something felt different. Before my doctor appointment, I broke out the home doppler to reassure myself and my husband. No heartbeat.

Drive to the OB office, Dr tries to reassure me I'm not trained on doppler and baby is fine. His face changes when he can't find the heartbeat. We head to the ultrasound and it's confirmed. A 2nd baby didn't make it. 

I didn't know my heart could break like that. My grief is all encompassing. Then I looked at my husband, saw the misery and tears running down his face and my heart shattered into dust. His excitement at being a father, his attachment to the little girl growing in my belly that he talked to even though she couldn't hear him yet, all was replaced by a soul crushing sadness. 

This can't be happening. This can't be our lives. They said we were young (27 & 28). They said we were healthy. They said we'd have no problems having children. I guess they were wrong.

The next week, we had to put our dog to sleep the day after my DH's birthday. He had been by my side for 8 years and we were still grieving the loss of our other dog 10 months before. We had finally decided to start TTC at the new year, however my best friend became extremely ill and passed away last month. I just feel like I've lost so much and just don't know what to do. We gave our best effort this cycle because I know my friend would want me to carry on but ended up with a BFN. I just don't know how much I can take.

* Period was supposed to start on/around 1/30
* Got positive pregnancy test on 2/1
* Bleeding/MC started on 2/7
* Bleeding stopped by 2/13
* Got a positive ovulation test on 2/17 (note, husband and I decided to hold of on TTC until after my next period)
* Saw OB on 2/25 who confirmed via urine and blood test that pregnancy was over
* Most recent period started on 3/6
* I think that period ended on/around 3/13, but historically I tend to have a few days of very faint bloody discharge before.

All in all, things seemed to be going normally and per usual schedule with the typical amount of bleeding, just offset by one week due to the 5 week pregnancy.  Since December I've been using ovulation test strips and per the instructions, I was to start testing CP7.  I forgot, but figured I was still having faint period spotting so it's okay.  I actually used the first pee stick on CP9 (on 3/14), and the results came back informing me that I am at peak fertility.  Husband and I also had a roll in the sack that morning right before getting up and in the evening just before going to sleep -- morning was for-fun, evening was just-in-case.

I know that I haven't really been testing for that long to be reliably track a trend and imagine that the exact day of ovulation can vary from cycle to cycle.  But, the previous months I've tested my peak fertility fell on CP 12-15 or so.  Though I suppose technically if I was to start testing on CP7, having peak fertility on CP9 shouldn't be out of the question.  I'm wondering if the MC may have thrown off my body a bit and it I should just consider this cycle a wash, or just roll with it.  I'm also, as I'm typing this, realizing that maybe my husband's semen might have gotten mixed in with the pee stream and could have affected the ovulation test results.

This is our last month to try before we're officially at the year without a baby, and it's been weirdly emotional for me.

And this would be a great month for it to happen too (not that I wouldn't just take any month...). It would be perfect for a conference I'm going to, for time off work... It just...figures.

We miss you everyday, and not a moment goes by that I don&#39;t think about you and what I would be doing if you were still here. Stay beautiful my angel boy, Mommy and Daddy love you.</p>

When Great Trees Fall, by Maya Angelou

&nbsp;

When great trees fall,  
rocks on distant hills shudder,  
lions hunker down  
in tall grasses,  
and even elephants  
lumber after safety.  
When great trees fall  
in forests,  
small things recoil into silence,  
their senses  
eroded beyond fear.  

&nbsp;

When great souls die,  
the air around us becomes  
light, rare, sterile.  
We breathe, briefly.  
Our eyes, briefly,  
see with  
a hurtful clarity.  
Our memory, suddenly sharpened,  
examines,  
gnaws on kind words  
unsaid,  
promised walks  
never taken.  

&nbsp;

Great souls die and  
our reality, bound to  
them, takes leave of us.  
Our souls,  
dependent upon their  
nurture,  
now shrink, wizened.  
Our minds, formed  
and informed by their  
radiance,  
fall away.  
We are not so much maddened  
as reduced to the unutterable ignorance  
of dark, cold  
caves.  

&nbsp;

And when great souls die,  
after a period peace blooms,  
slowly and always  
irregularly.  Spaces fill  
with a kind of  
soothing electric vibration.  
Our senses, restored, never  
to be the same, whisper to us.  
They existed.  They existed.  
We can be.  Be and be  
better.  For they existed.

I finally received my blood panel results today. I was tested for all of the antiphospholipid syndromes, thyroid, blood clotting issues and mutations, protein s + c deficiency, factor V leiden, prolactin levels. 

I'm within normal ranges on everything. 

Last week I dug up the 2013 3d CT scan results of my pelvic area (I had a kidney stone then) and found that they defined my uterus as ""unremarkable"".

So I'm normal on that too.

I have mixed feelings. After two back-to-back losses (one missed miscarriage, one blighted ovum), like many of us, I was hoping for some kind of answer. The only thing I haven't been tested for is MTHFR and the type of testing RE's would get into with egg quality and gene karyotyping. I'm hesitant on going to a RE just yet, and was sort of hoping to return to TTC and give this one more go.

I am currently experiencing incredibly long cycles after my miscarriage.  I am so desperate to be regular and while I do plan on calling my OB tomorrow to ask what I should be doing (today is CD37), this isn't ok.  I don't know if I ovulated this month (thermometer is a piece of crap) and my cycle dates have varied so few and far in-between since I've miscarried. 

I've been looking into Vitex and red raspberry leaf tea, has anyone tried either for long cycles?  I'm leaning towards trying raspberry leaf tea as soon as CD1 hits. It seems like it helps based on what I've found from basic googling but I was wondering if anyone here had any success in shortening their long cycles.  I'm not trying to go into inducing ovulation with medication just yet since this was my first cycle actually trying since the miscarriage.

111,2048,confidence,<praw.reddit.Reddit object at 0x7f12a630cd90>,,ttcafterloss,"My wife is a wonderful and beautiful woman of 28 years old and I am a lucky husband of 29 years old. We are high school sweethearts, each other's best friends for what seems like forever, and the only one each other has been with so we are very much in tune with each other's feelings, wants, and needs. She is a NICU nurse with a great heart and a fierce love for animals. She does struggle with confidence (if only she saw what I see.. but that's another topic) and anxiety pretty badly (genetic). We will have been married for six years in June and the last year has been easily our most difficult. We have miscarried twice since July and quite honestly it had been damn hard on us both. We have cried together, argued, and just struggled with life. She has gone from being her happy self to person who just doesn't expect anything good from life. She is changed as anyone would be. Please don't mistake this for complaining about her. She is my world and our marriage has only gotten stronger over the last few months. Even our sex life has improved which I honestly expected would dwindle to nothing. We are more intimate with each other (sexually and not) and have relied on each other more and more. I say this to show how this has changed us. 

Our story:
She stopped taking birth control back in April of last year and we were pregnant by the end of June. We were ecstatic. We had waited until we both had jobs that would financially allow us to do anything we needed to do for our baby and while the waiting was difficult (wife had baby fever for years but was in nursing school so it wasn't reasonable for us), our time was finally here. We called her doctor and got our first appointment scheduled for when we would be about 8 weeks. 
The next couple of weeks were uneventful. Minimal symptoms on her end which concerned her (my wife is very much a worrier. She expects the worst to happen in almost any situation so I usually end up having to be the optimist and try to keep her mindset as positive as possible.) Anyways, minimal symptoms, so she is a nervous wreck thinking something is wrong, that she should be sick or nauseous or something. I try to convince her that maybe she is just a lucky one that doesn't have to experience those symptoms or maybe that they will come once we are further along. 
Appointment day hits and we go to the doctor together. She is very nervous to the point of almost being sick whereas I am happy and eager to get her mind at ease. We are called back to the ultrasound room and judging from dates we should be 8 weeks give or take a few days so a heartbeat should be detectable. Excitement builds.

And then that terrible image comes up. 

The gestational sac was there but it was empty. My wife being a nurse (NICU nurse at that) knew immediately what it meant. Dumb husband over here didn't know what was going on at first but from my wife's face I figured it out pretty quickly. We were taken to a room after she got dressed and she lost it. I was alternating between holding her and getting tissues for her all the while I am just stunned. It had never occurred to me that we might not get a baby out of a pregnancy. 
Doctor came in and we talked about the possibilities it could be. Miscarriage, ectopic, or really early. I freaked out internally at the word ectopic cause i knew that could be really serious surgery and could affect her long term. I made myself sick over the next few days worrying about that so I never really grieved the miscarriage like my wife did. Thankfully that didn't happen. We got levels checked for a few days, confirmed the miscarriage, and had a D&C done with no complications. We both struggled with the emotional roller coaster in the next couple of months; grief, anger, jealousy, depression, fear, repeat. I basically played the parts of emotional support for her during recovery and let her vent when she needed it all the while dealing with my feelings when not with her.
Fast forward to October. Wife has recovered physically from surgery and we have been given the green light to try again. We both agree that it's best to try again right away (every new pregnancy announcement is like a dagger that starts the cycle over again so we need our own to get back to normal). We get pregnant right away and with alot of nerves and fear have our first appointment right before Thanksgiving.
A few days before our appointment, my wife starts bleeding. Not heavy but still very concerning. Panicked, she calls the doctor and we get in a day sooner. Ultrasound shows one sac and a second spot that could be a second sac or blood. At this point we were between 4 and 5 weeks so nothing was visible. They pull her numbers and say nothing looks alarming at this point. When we go to the original appointment a few days later, the Ultrasound looks the same and her levels have barely gone up. 

Another miscarriage. 

(TMI warning) Doctor prescribes a medicine to make her miscarry at home (didn't want to do another D&C so close and risk her developing scar tissue). That was horrible. She started bleeding about Thanksgiving and it didn't quit for a few weeks. Every time she went to the bathroom there were bits of tissue which was heartbreaking to watch so I can only imagine how badly it must have hurt feeling it as well. This one was much more emotionally trying because of that. 

We went to see a specialist in December to get a plan and run some tests to try and determine a cause. All genetics screens on both of us were normal, her clotting factors and physiology (uterus, ovaries, tubes, etc.) were normal. The only thing off was here TSH level. For a normal person who is not pregnant, below 4.0 is normal. Hers is 3.5 so it's fine for a normal person. For a pregnant person the level needs to be below 2.5 however. Anything above that raises the miscarriage rate drastically (basically seems like the odds of a miscarriage are about 2/3s of the time if the level is above 2.5). So I think we have a cause but she doesn't see it that way (grief is blinding her to it I think). 

We go to have her level checked again tomorrow and if it is below 2.5 we will have the green light again which would mean we could conceive again right after our first would have been due (March 24). We are both as emotionally ready to have another go as we can be and have had good talks about how fun a Christmas baby would be so I really hope this works out as she needs something to be happy about again. 

All of that to ask this, ladies who have had multiple losses is there any advice you can provide that can help me keep her spirits up and keep her from worrying and stressing more than she already will? What did your SO do for you that really helped during your next pregnancy? What was the hardest part of being pregnant again?

I just finished a CP, which happened two months after a mmc at 9 weeks. I'm ok, but frustrated and anxious. I just turned 34 and I know we waited too long to try. 

My doctor is concerned about low progesterone in both pregnancies and also about the fact that I tend to ovulate late (usually day 20, last month day 30).

She's putting me on Clomid to shorten my cycle and hopefully bump up the progesterone. She's an OB and I don't think she'll be tracking anything except a 21-day blood test. I'm expected to ovulate on day 14 or 15. I know this isn't ideal (the not testing or visualizing part), but my insurance is shit and I'd rather not spend for an RE just yet. 


I read through all the threads on Clomid here and it sounds like I just need to take it at night, use the OPKs from day 8 and BD every other day from there too. Today is CD2 so I start tomorrow.
