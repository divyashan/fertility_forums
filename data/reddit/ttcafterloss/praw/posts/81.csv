I’ve been lurking a while so I want to give a quick background on my situation – we’ve been TTC since October 2018, I had a CP in the first cycle of trying (4w6d). We continued trying again right away and became pregnant in February 2019 but I had a MMC at 8w (measured 6w1d). We started trying again as soon as we were able in May of 2019 and it’s been nothing but BFNs since then. After the second loss we became very worried that something was wrong and pushed for testing even though my doctor tried to have us wait for potential third loss (I will never understand this…) but we pushed and I have had the following tests:

&#x200B;

* Karyotyping
* Beta-2 Glycoprotein I, IgG and IgM
* Anti-Cardiolipin IgG Ab, IgM and IgA
* Lupus Anticoagulant Screen - PTT-LA and DRVVT
* Prolactin (I have hyperprolactinemia that I have been treating for years)
* TSH Reflex

All results have come back normal and I also had a SHG that showed no abnormalities with my uterus. My next step was requesting additional hormone testing throughout my cycle to make sure everything there is normal. My OBGYN ordered a CD3 hormone test which I assume will test FSH, LH & E2 – I followed up with her to see if there would be additional tests throughout my cycle and her response was “There are only 2 times during your cycle that it makes sense to test for hormones. Early days of your period and after ovulation to confirm you have ovulated. If you have anything specific in mind, just let me know.” 

Is she right? Does anyone have any recommendations of additional hormone testing I should ask for? Would they be testing my progesterone to confirm ovulation? 

Sometimes I feel a little crazy trying to get tested for as much as possible – but if there’s anything that I can do that will help I will do it.

I am a 33 yo American teacher living in Germany. I have one LC and I had one miscarriage. I have a lovely  German husband. I love nature and hiking and animals. I am a mediocre knitter and I dabble in painting and drawing. I periodically try out jogging. I probably have adhd (not joking about it, I just haven't been able to get a diagnosis). I like scifi and thrillers. 

I had a miscarriage two weeks ago at 8 weeks. I had a D&E. Please no consolation. I appreciate the thought but it's just hard for me to hear ""sorry for your loss"" right now. I just don't want to think about it anymore. 

My husband and I have tried having sex a few times, and I want to, but all I can think about is my fear of getting pregnant again too soon and having another loss. It's a real mood killer. It really sucks too because I used to wish my husband would initiate sex more often (he has a high stress job that kills his libido sometimes), so I don't like turning him down. 

I really want to try again in a few months, but I worry that I won't be ready emotionally. We were so excited to try for #2 before this happened. We were so excited for another baby. I was set and determined to enjoy and savour what I thought would be my last pregnancy. Now, if I get pregnant again, I don't know how I will get through it without constant fear of another loss. 

It was/is so hard. I feel like I am mourning this baby alone because nobody else had a connection  with the baby, only me. My friends and family are very supportive but it's naturally not such a tender wound for them as it is for me. On days that I feel better, I feel guilty for moving on.

I just finished my LPN program about a month prior (March, so I found out I was pregnant April) and I was preparing for my NCLEX. That day changed me and my fiancée's life. We're both young, with him being 22 and in the military, he was also terrified of what to come. But we decided to take the responsibility head on, because that's how much we loved our baby.

I'm going to get to the meat and potatoes of this post because if I go on about the whole journey, it will be a novel. Considering that the both of us are young, and we thought the chance of us having genetic complications with our daughter would be low, we thought we were in the clear. Boy we were wrong. We had our 20 week anatomy scan about 2 weeks ago, the doctor said they couldn't find kidneys, long story short, that's a very big deal and the amniotic fluid is low. We decided to wait for another torturous 2 weeks, so last Thursday for confirmation. It's the same thing, nothing has changed. I found out just today they found some markers of an aneuploidy, I had no idea what that was until I found out it was something genetic. Even though my genetic test I took for my 20 week scan came back low risk and normal. The doctors still have no clue what is going on with my baby. 

I've been to two different doctors and they have said the same thing. The baby will most likely, or even 100% die in utero or I will deliver a stillbirth, but they don't know the reason why. They have given us the option to terminate, which is what we will most likely do, I am too terrified to even think about it right now, but I know it's more necessary if anything. I don't want to deliver a stillbirth or let my daughter suffer on the table for 10 minutes for my sake. 

I'm honestly so tired of repeating myself of what is going on, but I really need support. I've already gotten people indirectly telling me what to do-one being the director of nursing for the company I've recently been hired for.

I finally got a positve pregnancy test and we were over the moon. We wanted our child to have a little sibling and expand our family. I set an appointment, started taking prenatals and continued my already healthy lifestyle. 

Then I felt the pain. I called the doctor right away and was brought in for bloodwork and an ultrasound. I was trending up correctly with my hcg levels but I was diagnosed with a cyst which was what my pain was attributed to. No biggie, I could handle that, better safe than sorry. 

Not one week later the pain was unbearable and I began to bleed. I was back in the doctors office for another round of bloodwork and ultrasound. The worst was confirmed. I had a miscarriage. Or so I thought. 

I was scheduled to continue bloodwork to trend down the hcg levels before we could try again. I had an appointment Monday. By Wednesday the pain was once again bordering unbearable. I was told to come in right away. I was told my pain was perplexing to them but they would do another ultrasound to see what was going on. When the doctor came in I was told I had not had a miscarriage after all but instead had an ectopic pregnancy and needed surgery that day. 

After being checked into the hospital I was told that I was in danger of losing a fallopian tube because of how far this progressed. The surgery happened and when I woke up I was told that the embryo was an impressive size and caused my tube to be so distended that it had to be removed. My stomach was also filled with blood even after bleeding so much because the embryo was causing it to leak into my abdomen. 

I had three ultrasounds over the period of less than three weeks from the first sign of pain and I still had to go through surgery, have multiple medical Bills and a significant decrease in my ability to conceive. 

I did everything right and still mourned the loss of my child twice. I am devastated knowing that this was missed on the first two ultrasounds and by the time I received the correct diagnosis my choices were made for me. It was too late for medication intervention and it was surgery or die.

We started trying for a baby in January after many agonizing years of waiting for the ""right"" time. I am 35 so a little antsy. My husband wanted to wait for several good reasons, but it was difficult for me to say the least as like most of us I suppose having a family is a key life goal and dream. Since January I have had 3 losses - 1 chemical, 1 eptopic, and this week one MMC at 11 weeks.

We'll start trying again right away, but I am feeling very drained. I was SO fatigued for about 5-6 weeks,  I could barely function at work. It was so embarrassing, as I had recently been promoted. I also just felt terrible. And it was all for nothing. :(

It's so hard not knowing how many more times I'll have to go through this? Since this was miscarriage #2 it will be genetically tested, so we are waiting for that. The uncertainty of it all is a real psychological challenge...

I am grateful that we are blessed in that we have been getting positive tests easily, and I know that is a major major blessing. God willing that remains the case.

<p>I’ve been trying for #2 for over a year. Within that time I had a MMC, CP and then 9 months of nothing. This is my 3rd month at the RE. We did Femara the first cycle then last cycle did Femara and Ovidrel trigger, which my body reacted well to. My husband hasn’t done a SA but it wasn’t ordered because I’ve had 3 pregnancies and at least 1 was successful. I requested an IUI this cycle and my doctor is saying that he doesn’t recommend it because statistically it’s not that much better than timed intercourse and since my body responds so well to the meds, he would like to do another medicated cycle, but is willing to do the IUI if I want it.

For some background, husband and I have been TTC since August 2017. In January 2018 my husband was diagnosed with testicular cancer which was luckily very easily treated with surgery only. No chemo or radiation. In June 2018 I got pregnant and then had a miscarriage at 8 weeks. I took some well needed time off from TTC to fix my mental health after the miscarriage. Since then my husband had a semen analysis which came back good and I had seen a doctor about starting Provera, having some blood tests and then we would be figuring out the next steps from there. 

My husband has regular CT scans because of his testicular cancer to watch for it to come back somewhere else. He went to an appointment on the 16th where they told him it had come back in a lymph node in his abdomen. He is starting radiation next week. Radiation for this type of cancer has a 90% success rate so again we are very very lucky that this is so treatable. 

Here comes the selfishness on my part. We were told that we need to take a break from TTC naturally during radiation and for 140 days after. This would put us at mid-February before we can start trying again. There is also a chance that the radiation will affect his fertility. I’m devastated. And I feel like a piece of shit for it. 

My husband is incredibly stressed because he didn’t expect the cancer to come back, the chances of it happening were relatively low. While I’m stressed about this too, I’m not too worried because his doctor is extremely confident that he will react properly to the radiation and be completely fine. 

I’m very upset because this has felt like a long hard two years of TTC, I was just starting to get somewhere with seeing the doctor about it. And now my husband may end up with fertility problems and we have to wait a long time to find out. I can’t talk to him about how upset I am because I feel so selfish for it. He wants to have kids but if I didn’t want them right away he would have no problem waiting. So he’s not really worrying about that right now, just his own health. Rightfully so, if I were him I’d only be worrying about myself. 

I feel so selfish and like such an awful person for being more upset at the setbacks in TTC than I am about him needing treatments. 



TL;DR
Been TTC for two years, one pregnancy resulting in miscarriage. Husband had cancer and was fine. Cancer came back and now he needs radiation (which has a 90% success rate).

If it were up to me I would’ve started trying to have a kid a month or two ago, but my husband doesn’t feel ready.

I’m already taking folic acid because my doctor told me to take it for 3 months prior to trying to conceive (and I’m anxious as hell about having a birth control failure again so I’m going to do everything in my power to help things work out regardless of when it happens.) I’m on some meds because of my hypermobility spectrum disorder (similar to EDS)/GERD/migraine/mental illness combo, but they are all relatively safe in pregnancy. No super serious genetic disorders seem to run in my family. I’m Ashkenazi Jewish, but my husband isn’t, so we probably don’t need to do carrier genetic screening, I guess?</p>

<p>Am I missing anything that I need to do or should do? I know this is probably me trying to exercise control over a situation that I ultimately have no control over, but doing everything in my power to help this go well makes me feel better, I guess.</p>

For those who don't know my history, here we go. 

I have been pregnant 6 times with 5 losses and 1 success:

1. May 2015: Heart stopped at 10+4, we found out the next day, there was no known reason, D&C, no testing
2. February 2016: Heart stopped at 7+4, found out at 10+3, D&C with testing, no abnormalities found, it was a boy <3
3. March 2016: Chemical pregnancy - loss at 5+1
4. October 2016: Chemical pregnancy - loss at 5+4
5. December 2016: Ectopic pregnancy, took weeks to diagnose and had a D&C to be sure because we couldn't find it. Then I took methotrexate.
6. December 2017: Full term successful pregnancy

We did TONS of testing and never found a reason. My successful pregnancy was tracked very closely and had no issues. So confusing and hard. All of it. 

Now we want to TTC again. It's been a hard time agreeing to do it, due to all the pain and issues. Plus I am 35. With my crappy history, I decided to get some testing done. I found out that my AMH has plummeted...to below average (I'll be honest..I cried and went to a bar). Now, instead of getting to pretend things might just work out this time, and just trying, I am seeing my RE this week to make a plan. 

I had to remove my IUD and I'm waiting for my first period so that we can test some more things. We need to test my FSH (so it can correlate with my AMH) and we'll see what else my RE suggests...

So, back in the TTC game and also straight back into RE-land. Sigh.

93,2048,confidence,<praw.reddit.Reddit object at 0x7f12a630cd90>,,ttcafterloss,"Hi everyone, 

I'm a lurker, not really a poster.  I have a pretty graphic story.  I'll try to keep it short and sweet, but please be cautioned I wouldn't want to trigger anyone.  I just really need somewhere to get this off of my chest tonight and maybe find someone with encouraging words.  

To give some background; two years ago I lost my youngest son Leighton at 25 Weeks.  He was admitted to the NICU after an emergency classical c-section.  At DOL 4 we discovered he had a Grade 4 brain bleed with a midline shift.  My poor baby was braindead and suffering.  I could tell something was different when I walked into the NICU that morning.  He was much more ""active"" squirming around, grimacing...I didn't know what to do or think.  When we were given our decision to provide comfort care or withdraw care, I didn't know what to do.  I didn't want my baby to suffer, but selfishly I wanted, prayed, hoped he would pull through..by some miracle it would all go away and he would live.  Ultimately, after consulting a chaplain, social services, many medical doctors, we decided to withdraw care and give our baby the most snuggles and comfort we could.  

To begin, I was 18 weeks pregnant and woke up in the middle of the night to go to the bathroom and began dripping bright red blood.  I went into the nearest ER where I was told I was having a miscarriage...and to go home.  This was devastating, what was even worse was worrying all weekend.  Luckily, I was able to get in that following Monday with my OBGYN.  This brought some peace as I found out that I wasn't having a miscarriage, in fact, the baby was healthy and fine.  I was put on pelvic rest and was sent home...feeling great.  Then, at 20 weeks, I again had a massive bleed in the middle of the night.  I returned to the ER and this time was admitted.  I was monitored and placed on bed rest in the hospital for 3 days.  By that time the bleeding had slowed to a rust brown and I was cleared to return home.  At 22 weeks, I again had another bleed.  I returned to the ER where I was admitted for the second time.  I was late in the 22d week and they made the decision to give me steroids for the baby, just in case.  I was told I would be admitted until the baby came, which was the scariest thing I ever heard.  I stayed at this hospital for one week until I was transferred to another hospital with a NICU capable of caring for an early infant.  At 25 weeks 1 day, I woke up in the morning and began to hemorrhage.  The toilet pan was filled with blood, the floor, my bed..it was everywhere.  I pulled the rip cord in the bathroom and before I knew it there were, what seemed like, a hundred people in my room.  I could not stop crying. Why was this happening, I was so angry, with myself, with God, with everyone around me.  I was moved from the antepartum wing to the labor and delivery floor, ""just in case"".  I knew what this meant for me.  I was hooked up to monitors, poked and prodded, then at around 5 PM that same night I began feeling intense contractions.  I called for a nurse who checked and I began pouring blood.  The look on her face still haunts me.  Within probably 5 minutes I was in the OR.  I remember hearing everything, I felt like again there were a million people in the room.  I heard them announce his time of birth: 5:23pm.  I never heard him cry.  He was placed in this little bag, as my husband recalls, placed under a warmer and immediately transported to the NICU.  It was well after midnight before I even knew if he survived.  There were many more medical complications (to include a punctured lung and a torn esophagus from medical negligence - in my opinion)...after-all it was a training hospital.  But I was optimistic, when I finally got to go see him I was so scared.  He was tiny, big for a 25 weeker (2 full pounds!!)..but still tiny.  So the story goes on and as you've already read, he does not make it.  But, I'll save those details for another day or a PM if anyone is truly interested...because I'm off topic at this point and torturing myself.

As it's already been written, it's been two years since all of this.  My husband and I have been trying now for a year and a half...we've done 6 months of fertility treatments after a year of trying without assistance.  With our first son it took us 4 years to get pregnant, our second took two, and now I'm afraid I'll never get pregnant again.  I'm afraid the trainees practicing the classical incision scarred me to the point of no repair.  I'm afraid that my stress and anxiety about it all is hindering my ability.  We already have MFI but with our current treatments, there is ""no issue"".  We are just ""secondary unexplained infertility.""  I'm so exhausted, mentally, emotionally, physically.  I feel like no one around me understands the desire I have for more children or the stress I feel with all of my treatments.  I keep telling myself that I'm content, that if I never get pregnant again I will be okay.  But I'm such a liar...I want more kids...I always have!  I can't come to terms, I don't know how to accept it.  I feel so selfish.  I have a living child, and I feel so inadequate.  I feel like in wanting another child so bad, it's as if he is not enough.  He is, but I so badly want him to experience a sibling, I want him to have that bond for life, I want to grow my family.  He knows about his brother, we do not hide that.  He sometimes cries for him, I'm not sure why as he is somewhat young still.  He'll ask where his brother is, and we explain but inside it kills me little by little.  I have multiple friends and family members who are pregnant or have recently had babies...and while I'm so happy for them, I'm so sad.  I write my texts, with tears in my eyes, and tell them how I'm so happy, but I lie in bed and cry that this isn't and may never be me again.  

I've been to bereavement counseling and marriage counseling.  I have come to terms and accepted where I'm at as far as my loss.  But as I continue to see other people carrying babies around the stores and park, I see pregnant ladies all around me...and I can't help but feel like I've lost so much more than my son.  I have friends who I've tried to confide in and they insult with ""well you could always foster or adopt,"" so I grin and say yeah, that's a great idea...but really...it's just different.  And this is why I'm selfish...because I want my children...I want to be pregnant....I want to have what everyone else gets....I guess I just need more...I know fostering and adoption is a great way to give children a chance...but I really just don't feel like I'm at that point where I can accept it's not going to happen...I'm doing doing the fertility treatments, because I need a break...but I really, really can't handle knowing I have no control...I can't just let go. 

I feel like I'm rambling, I probably look like more of an a\*\* that I intended to...and I'm so sorry this is so long.  If you're still with me, thank you.

I&#39;m afraid the trainees practicing the classical incision scarred me to the point of no repair.  I&#39;m afraid that my stress and anxiety about it all is hindering my ability.  We already have MFI but with our current treatments, there is &quot;no issue&quot;.  We are just &quot;secondary unexplained infertility.&quot;  I&#39;m so exhausted, mentally, emotionally, physically.  I feel like no one around me understands the desire I have for more children or the stress I feel with all of my treatments.  I keep telling myself that I&#39;m content, that if I never get pregnant again I will be okay.  But I&#39;m such a liar...I want more kids...I always have!  I can&#39;t come to terms, I don&#39;t know how to accept it.  I feel so selfish.  I have a living child, and I feel so inadequate.  I feel like in wanting another child so bad, it&#39;s as if he is not enough.  He is, but I so badly want him to experience a sibling, I want him to have that bond for life, I want to grow my family.  He knows about his brother, we do not hide that.  He sometimes cries for him, I&#39;m not sure why as he is somewhat young still.  He&#39;ll ask where his brother is, and we explain but inside it kills me little by little.  I have multiple friends and family members who are pregnant or have recently had babies...and while I&#39;m so happy for them, I&#39;m so sad.  I write my texts, with tears in my eyes, and tell them how I&#39;m so happy, but I lie in bed and cry that this isn&#39;t and may never be me again.  </p>

<p>I&#39;ve been to bereavement counseling and marriage counseling.  I have come to terms and accepted where I&#39;m at as far as my loss.  But as I continue to see other people carrying babies around the stores and park, I see pregnant ladies all around me...and I can&#39;t help but feel like I&#39;ve lost so much more than my son.  I have friends who I&#39;ve tried to confide in and they insult with &quot;well you could always foster or adopt,&quot; so I grin and say yeah, that&#39;s a great idea...but really...it&#39;s just different.  And this is why I&#39;m selfish...because I want my children...I want to be pregnant....I want to have what everyone else gets....I guess I just need more...I know fostering and adoption is a great way to give children a chance...but I really just don&#39;t feel like I&#39;m at that point where I can accept it&#39;s not going to happen...I&#39;m doing doing the fertility treatments, because I need a break...but I really, really can&#39;t handle knowing I have no control...I can&#39;t just let go. </p>

<p>I feel like I&#39;m rambling, I probably look like more of an a** that I intended to...and I&#39;m so sorry this is so long.  If you&#39;re still with me, thank you.  I hope you all find peace.</p>

We are trying for child number two. Conceived baby number one in under six months and he is a healthy toddler. 

Got pregnant for the second time this summer after 4-6 months of trying. Silent miscarriage at 6w, discovered at 9w.

The actual passing of the tissue occurred naturally.  About 12 days after, I felt like I was ovulating and had a very dark opk. Had sex on what was probably O-1, O, O+1. So now I'm maybe in the TWW? Are opks accurate that close to a miscarriage?

Also I can't decide if I want to start testing hcg tomorrow (10 dpo) or wait awhile. For what it's worth, I did take a (negative) hcg test a couple days back just to verify it was negative so I know any positive test going forward is a new pregnancy.

Still waiting on karyotype and genetic carrier screening on my husband and I. Also waiting for my goddamn period to come so I can get my cycle day 3 testing, and what I call the pictures of my parts tests. (Ultrasound of ovaries, HSG, and the saline one). Semen analysis is later this week.

The two big things: my recently miscarried embryo was chromosomalLu normal. This was a standard cultured karyotype, not a microarray.
I was very upset when I first learned this. Was hoping for a random trisomy, but I now know that it could have had some other random occurrence thing wrong with it that didn’t show up. Thanks reddit users for telling me things my medical team didn’t. 

My AMH is 0.881
At age 35, they like to see it at 1.0 or above, but The patient care coordinator telling me my results said this is only a little bit low.  She said it’s still a good number and not at all something to worry about. Obviously I’m still worried because of course I am! Anyone have any feedback or advice about that number?

Everything else normal. Thyroid, autoimmune, blood clotting, glucose, and whatever else they tested for was all good. Which I think is good?
Sucks there is no answer, and there might not be. But good there isn’t a known major issue. I think.

I also asked her about the possibility of  endometriosis and the receptivadx test. She said endo doesn’t typically cause problems unless it’s a blocked tube or something and laparoscopy isn’t usually done unless it is really causing problems. Also they usually only do receptivadx test for people doing IVF, but that I should bring it up with my doctor at our follow up. Anyone have dissenting opinions on the endo thing? I have read some emerging studies about receptivity of the endometrium going in cycles and sub-clinical endo causing problems.  I will certainly bring this up with the RE at our follow-up visit once all tests are completed.

I have not been diagnosed with endo, but my mom and I both had/have excruciatingly painful menstrual cramps. Mom conceived only once in 15 years of trying. I conceive easily but miscarry. Could be coincidence but I just wonder if there is something we could both have.

The major problem comes from anovulation. So I’ve been on clomid. And I can’t tell y’all how much money I’ve spent on the ClearBlue Advanced Digital OPKs. I’ll pee on those damn things every day, sometimes more than once a day. I have a stick and test strips in every bathroom. And I’ve noticed that one stick is always negative/“low”. The other one is always a flashing smiling face indicating “high” LH surge. I’ve only ever had one solid “peak” test, and that’s when we conceived our last, which ended in a miscarriage. 

So today I peed on both sticks at once, because it’s annoying the piss out of me (pardon the pun). And sure enough, at the exact same time, one test strip had the stupid flashing face, as it’s had for two weeks straight. And the other had a big old O, indicating nothing. Wtf is up with these tests? What’s the threshold? They’re both clear blue advanced digital tests. I’m using the same stream of urine. Can I even trust this brand going forward??


So I’m at my wits end with these tests. It’s not my only method of tracking; temping has been a bitch to interpret this cycle, I’ve had no other physical signs of O.

The analysis is a standard karyotype, not the more specialized microarray that would pick up some translocations. The RE said that’s fine since we’re getting karyotypes on ourselves to check for that anyway.

Since it’s our second miscarriage, we ran to a fertility clinic for testing right after. Still waiting on the preliminary results and waiting for my period so I can have the cycle-day specific tests.

My background:
My husband and I got pregnant in early/mid-July without trying. I'd gone off my birth control, we figured it'd take a few months for my cycle to even out, and then in the fall we'd start actively tracking l when I was ovulating and trying. When we got the positive test after I missed my second period post-birth control, we were pretty shocked, but excited. We felt some pretty serious levels of being undeserving, or like we didn't ""earn"" the pregnancy, as we'd watched friends struggle with fertility. Coming to Reddit, I felt that even more strongly seeing all the acronyms and testing and conversation surrounding trying for a baby.

Before getting pregnant, we'd had a trip planned to Tahiti with another married couple who we're incredibly close with. We asked the doctors after finding out about the pregnancy to make sure it was still okay to go, and it was. Just the usual be vigilant about mosquito bites and don't drink the water, etc.
Upon arriving in Tahiti last week, I went to the bathroom and saw blood in my underwear. I was just shy of 7 weeks. I immediately messaged my doctor, she said to monitor how much I was bleeding, consistency, and color. At first I was sure I was having a mc, but after doing some research it seemed possible that it was a SCH. We went from completely distraught to very cautiously optimistic. We of course couldn't see a doctor in Tahiti, so we spent our 9 day vacation just trying to put it out of our minds as much as possible until we knew for sure.

We got back into the states today, and I immediately went in for bloodwork. It confirmed that I had in fact had a miscarriage.

We're just so sad. I feel like my body has betrayed me and my husband. Why did it let me get pregnant so easily, just to lose it... Obviously things are still very raw. 

My sister in law has had one loss and knew we were expecting, so she's been a great resource. But this sub is my new reality now, rather than the April 2020 Bumpers. Today I've found some comfort in hearing others' stories, so wanted to add mine in hopes it resonates with others, too.

Last week while I was working I began spotting and passing tissue clumps. I had an ultrasound the next day that revealed I was not as far along but there was cardiac activity. Yesterday morning I had my follow up ultrasound ; they completed a trans abdominal and transvaginal and concluded that there was no longer cardiac activity as well as no growth since last week. I should be 8w3d but instead the embryo was measuring around 5w5d. This is devastating to me. I know I can try again someday for a rainbow baby but I wanted this baby. I was very excited making plans. My sister in law is pregnant as well as several friends due around the same time. I have to decide between misoprostol or a D&C. I’d rather take the pills and be at home but am concerned with a history of anemia and strong family history of hemorrhage and blood transfusions related to OB issues.

I am devastated. Last week while I was working I began spotting and passing tissue clumps. I had an ultrasound the next day that revealed I was not as far along but there was cardiac activity. Yesterday morning I had my follow up ultrasound ; they completed a trans abdominal and transvaginal and concluded that there was no longer cardiac activity as well as no growth since last week. I should be 8w3d but instead the embryo was measuring around 5w5d. This is devastating to me. I know I can try again someday for a rainbow baby but I wanted this baby. I was very excited making plans. My sister in law is pregnant as well as several friends due around the same time. I have to decide between misoprostol or a D&amp;C. I’d rather take the pills and be at home but am concerned with a history of anemia and strong family history of hemorrhage and blood transfusions related to OB issues.

I had a D&C on August 2nd for a Partial Mola Pregnancy (PMP). At the moment of the D&C they did not suspect a pmp so they didn't test my HCG levels.

<p>So my levels are dropping quickly. I tookan early pregnancy test on Friday had a faint line and yesterday a squinter. So my HCG levels are very low that my 20mg/ul can barely test it.</p>

<p>Now my question is, does anyone have experience with a pmp? And how long did you have to wait  after reaching HCG0 from your doctor.</p>

<p>Hubby and I were planning on waiting 3 months to ttc again. But now I don&#39;t think I can hold out so long. Especially now my bff just found out that she is pregnant.</p>

I just had my third missed miscarriage and I'm really struggling. I was thinking of making a pros and cons list and then thought I'd ask other folks going through this if they'd continue or not.

**Reasons to Stop TTC:**

* I turn 40 in September which is when I have always said I'd be done with birthing kids.
* I have diminished ovarian reserve (DOR) with an AMH of .22 and FSH of 14.9.
* My eggs are the equivalent of a 43-year-old due to endometriosis (stage 4) and endometrioma in 2014. The age equivalency is is according to my fertility doctor.
* Even if we did have a viable pregnancy my risk of chromosome disorders is high due to egg quality/age.
* The last 2 pregnancies were at 6 weeks when they stopped growing and this last one (D&C was last Monday) stopped growing at the 5-week mark.
* I'm am not myself when I'm pregnant. I'm incredibly stressed out, forgetful, and sensitive as fuck. It is unpleasant to be me, and it is unpleasant to be around me. I try so freaking hard to not burn down bridges at work (or home) but it's like all I want to do is light the world on fire. This white-hot rage at the drop of a hat. I can't stress enough how deeply my psyche is affected by the pregnancy hormones and stress of knowing I'll likely miscarry.
* I have been pregnant twice this year. My weight has ballooned and my sense of myself has crashed. I work really hard to lose weight when not pregnant and then a pregnancy throws me into a tailspin of swelling and depression and stress eating. Since I'm high risk for miscarriage I am not allowed to keep working out. Grrr.
* I have a beautiful, amazing 3-year-old.

**Reasons to Try One More Time:**

* There is a small chance I will conceive a viable and healthy baby. We're going to check on the percentage with the fertility specialist we're seeing, but my understanding is it's very small. Like 15% or so. I'm not sure if this percentage includes babies with or without chromosome issues.
* Sweet, sweet baby smell from sweet baby head. This last pregnancy was full of phantom smells where I just smelled baby head and baby formula in random places and would start crying.
* Another amazing little person to meet and be a part of our family.
* A brother or sister for my kid.
* I've wanted a second child since the moment we brought our son home.
* My husband would understand if I decided I couldn't continue but he'd be so disappointed. I've told him I'm struggling and he knows I'm writing this here. He'll respect whatever decision I make, but I love him so much and hate to be the one to kill the dream.
* **The doctor thinks we'll have better luck with Clomid.** I don't understand how this will help me. I ovulate just fine. Like a clock. I get pregnant in one try. I'm not kidding. My quality is crap. I can't imagine how super-ovulating multiple shitty eggs is going to help my chances when my chances are so poor to begin with.

**So what should I do?**

* Should I try the Clomid?
* Should I stop trying?
* Should I try something other than Clomid?
* Should I try one more time (with medicine) but wait until November? This would be despite my doctor telling me not to wait because my egg quality is just going to keep dropping. November is when work calms down so I may be less stressed and it would be a better time of year to be off my rocker. Waiting also feels stressful. Being in limbo is really stressful for me.
* Other variations on this?

I'm really having a hard time allowing myself to back away from this journey. Lots of grief and disappointment but also a lot of fear around trying again without much of a chance. If you're wondering what I've done already I've been following the recommendations for Recurrent miscarriage in It Starts with the Egg since May.

Thanks in advance for any advice you can give.

**Additional Info:** 

I'm going to start seeing a counselor who specializes in fertility and infertility issues. 

I've been seeing a RE since May.

November is when work calms down so I may be less stressed and it would be a better time of year to be off my rocker. Waiting also feels stressful. Being in limbo is really stressful for me.</li>
<li>Other variations on this?</li>
</ul>

<p>I&#39;m really having a hard time allowing myself to back away from this journey. Lots of grief and disappointment but also a lot of fear around trying again without much of a chance. If you&#39;re wondering what I&#39;ve done already I&#39;ve been following the recommendations for Recurrent miscarriage in It Starts with the Egg since May.</p>

<p>Thanks in advance for any advice you can give.</p>

<p><strong>Additional Info:</strong> </p>

<p>I&#39;m going to start seeing a counselor who specializes in fertility and infertility issues. </p>

<p>I&#39;ve been seeing a RE since May. </p>

<p>Baby adoption, donor eggs, and IVF are not viable options for us for multiple reasons. Primarily it is the cost and low chance of success for each option. Taking on a large amount of debt doesn&#39;t feel wise when we have a child that it might impact negatively.</p>

I finally got a positive opks on CD 29/30 of my cycle post mmc - at the beginning of this cycle I took HCG tests and they were negative, so I started my 'cycle' knowing that I had no HCG in my system.  Had low opk scores until around cd28, then got a true positive on cd 29/30.  

I also had horrible ovulation pain + sickness  on CD 30 - the body aches and cramping have gone away, but I still have a sore throat, so I discarded my temp on CD 30 because that was the day I felt the most sick and it was higher than it should have been for O day.

I had a missed miscarriage. Found out about it at 11 weeks, on July 30th (for future people reading this post, it is now August 16th) and since then have had a series of strange events. Baby was fine at 10w3d (heartbeat of 178, in fact) but perished sometime between then and 11w2d

July 31st - The D&C. Bled for just 2 days after.


August 3rd and 4th - Had a fever of 100.4 and then 99.4 for about 24 hours


August 4th - Sex with the hubs


August 5th - Extremely sharp right sided ovary pain. Felt a lot like ovulation pain, but worse. Went away after a few hours. (This plus fever makes me wonder if I ovulated really early?)


August 12 - The nausea begins again. Ugh. I thought I was done with it. All previous pregnancy symptoms disappeared immediately after d&c. (I had very intense nausea and vomiting)


August 15th -  TMI. Started bleeding black blood. Super scared me. It was basically like black coffee in color and texture or whatever. Sorry to be gross. Stopped after a few hours. I wasn't in pain so I didn't see a doctor about it.


August 16th - Positive pregnancy test, also I puked in the book aisle at Walmart and can never show my face there again.

Could I actually be pregnant again so soon? There's no way, right? It was a very dark line on the test. 
How long does it take after a d&c for the pregnancy hormone to disappear? I'm so confused. Did anyone else have their symptoms disappear and return after a miscarriage, only to not be pregnant? Help me. :(
(Guys, I'm so sorry about the formatting of this post. I can't figure out how to do line breaks.)


August 17th UPDATE: I went to a OB/GYN Urgent Care. There isn't any ""fetal product"" leftover and I don't have an infection. The bleeding stopped yesterday and hasn't returned. They took blood to check my hcg levels and will do so again in a few days at my OB's office. Thanks for all of your responses, they really pushed me to actually see a doctor. (I wasn't going to. I am so tired of doctors right now.)
I saw a NP and she said the black was just old blood that finally found it's way out. She also said she didn't see any signs on the ultrasound of a cyst having ruptured recently (I was worried that the pain I felt days ago might have been a large cyst and not ovulation. I occasionally ovulate really early.)
The NP called and my HCG was 32.
