My wife and I just experienced our sixth loss. We've been looking for answers since after the first loss. Doctor has given up on endocrine causes, since my wife's hormones are great. We're young so she's not concerned about egg or sperm quality (although we're getting it tested). 

Anyway, I've been doing research. I've read about immunological, structural, hemotological, and genetic causes of loss. One thing that surprised me was how willing people were to accept tests for extremely rare conditions before more obvious ones were ruled out.

Many of us are familiar with the Rh system. Basically, you can be Rh positive or negative. If you're positive, you have an extra chemical on your red blood cells. If a man is positive and a woman negative, there is a 50-100% chance their baby will be positive. In this case, a woman may become sensitized to the rh factor, either during a birth, miscarriage, or stillbirth. If this happens, depending on the man, subsequent pregnancies carry a very high risk of miscarriage, stillbirth, or early infant loss. Being Rh negative is rare, but not that rare -- 10% of caucasian women will be Rh negative. Thus, the chance of an Rh positive man with an Rh negative women are around 9% -- not rare at all.

Of course, problems with Rh are incredibly rare in the modern world because every pregnant women is routinely tested for it.

However, there are *many* blood antigen systems -- ABO and Rh are only the two most commonly studied. Most don't have an effect on pregnancy, since the antibodies don't cross the placenta, but some do.

I was reading today about the Kell antigen system. It works like the Rh one. If a man is Kell+ and a woman Kell-, a first pregnancy with a Kell+ baby can sensitize the woman to Kell+ blood, regardless of how that pregnancy ends. Depending on the man's status, future children will have a 50-100% chance of being Kell+, and in a Kell- sensitized mother, these children have a high risk of pregnancy complications -- miscarriage, stillbirth, or early loss.

This effect is [not controversial](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hemolytic_disease_of_the_newborn_(anti-Kell%29). If the mother is sensitized, future pregnancies with Kell+ children need better management, or there is a risk of hemolytic disease of the newborn or stillbirth.

Unlike Rh, being Kell positive is quite rare -- 10% of men will carry the gene. However, due to the way statistics work, that still means 9% of couples will be Kell-heterozygous with the woman being Kell negative. Thus, this could potentially account for 10% of recurrent later loss. Like Rh, Kell is incredibly immunogenic -- after ABO and Rh, it is the most immunogenic antigen, and it readily crosses the placenta.

Moreover, unlike Rh, which is relatively rare outside of Europe or Africa (it is *very* rare for an Asian to be Rh negative), Kell is much more homogeneously distributed. This [study](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3705660/) indicates that about 9% of caucasians are Kell+, 4% of Indians, and around 3% of Africans. 

[Some historians](http://www.history.com/news/did-blood-cause-henry-viiis-madness-and-reproductive-woes) think that this is what caused Henry VIII's problems with repeat stillbirth, despite the number of wives he had. 

Anyway, given how readily many doctors will conduct a karyotype, despite less than 3-5% ~~1%~~ of recurrent loss sufferers actually having a reversal or translocation, I'm surprised couples aren't readily tested for the Kell antigen, given how much damage it can do. The blood test is readily available (I found it on [Quest's website](http://www.questdiagnostics.com/testcenter/TestDetail.action?ntc=8626)). Unlike Rh, being Kell positive is rare. Since Kell positive mothers are not at risk for complications, only fathers need to be tested to see if they are heterozygous or homozygous Kell positive. The treatments aren't as well developed as Rh, but they exist. Either way, you'd need to be seen by a high risk doctor and someone specialized in under-studied blood types. [More information here](http://contemporaryobgyn.modernmedicine.com/contemporary-obgyn/news/clinical/obstetrics-gynecology-womens-health/kell-sensitization-can-cause-fe?page=full)

I'm planning on asking our doctor about this, and while there is a low chance that my wife and I have it, it is quite likely that there is a couple on this board who is Kell-heterogeneous and may find an answer from this testing.

Last June around my wifes birthday we took a test and got the best news ever, we were finally going to be parents. We were both ecstatic. Trying to keep this news a secret was the hardest thing I had ever had to do.  But it was right to wait until we were ready.

(I am going to write the rest of this like I am talking to my daughter, I apologise)

I don't know if you know this, but the first time I saw your scan, your daddy cried, tears of absolute happiness and joy to see you for the first time. I couldn't wait to meet you. 

It was during your 20 week scan we got advised you had an anomaly, a few scans later and you were diagnosed with an umbilical vein varix. This basically meant part of your vein was widened and may cause issues but it will be monitored. 

It was still amazing to see you grow every few weeks. The changes were amazing. You were so beautiful even in those scan photo's, they caught your good side.

The day I will never forget was Thursday, 15th of December 2016, your mammy went to the doctors to see if you were okay and the midwife could not find your heartbeat. Your mammy called me and asked me to take her to hospital. We both thought you were just hiding and we were convinced. I even called your grandma to tell her we were going and that you would be fine.

I dropped your mammy off at the hospital doors and went to park the car. I found the ward where mammy was and I heard it. That scream, that cry, that noise that our world had ended and that you were no longer here with us. I hope you didn't hear that because you should never hear your mammy in such pain. 

We got home and discussed everything and decided we would buy a star in your name so you will live on forever. 

We got back to the hospital on the Saturday where mammy was to be induced to bring you out so we could see you. The midwives in the hospital were lovely to us all. They made sure we were looked after and comforted us in our time of need. We couldn't have asked for better people to be around us. 

On Tuesday morning the 20th of December at 5:18 am you were finally brought into this world. You were here, Our little Lexi Jayne. Even then we hung on to the hopes that you would cry and that you were okay. The doctors could have been wrong. Unfortunately we were the ones who were wrong. 

I am sorry i couldn't look at you straight away, I had to clear away the tears. I got to watch the midwife give you a bath and clothe you. You were such a cute baby. little bit of dark hair, brown eyes, cute button nose and red lips. You were perfect, my little angel. You would have been as tall as us too with legs like that. Mammy did say you had one hell of a kick lol.

Everyone came to see you, your aunt's, great aunts, and grandparents. They all loved you so much and still do. We all still miss you.

We gave you your little bear as we couldn't stand for you to be alone, I hope you're still looking after him. He will be there for you when you get scared or feel alone. 

On the day of your funeral, I got to hold you one last time as I carried your coffin to the alter of the church. That still to this day will be the hardest thing daddy has ever had to do. But nothing would stop me doing it for you. Your last journey would be with me, not a stranger.

It's been 5 month since you left us, we still talk to you, we still miss you, we still cry for you. That will never change.

Please know you will always be in our hearts and you will never be forgotten by anyone who's life you touched.

Every day is still a battle as me and your mammy discuss what we would be doing if you were here. Walks down the beach or just nights in all snuggled up together, as a family. 

We love you to the stars and back again,

Fly high my little angel.

Mammy and Daddy will always love you

Still trying to muster up the emotional strength to try to put my story into words. But I wanted to just give a little context to my situation. Last October I lost my son, Ashton, at 38 5/7 weeks. I'm 25 and he was my first pregnancy. I'll go into more details when I decide to write my post. But anyways... I am a Neonatal ICU nurse and I had just started my job as a nurse when I found out I was pregnant. It was kind of scary to see all the things that could go wrong but as I got further along in my pregnancy, I started to get comfortable. Then, of course, everything went to shit.  Going back to work was really really really hard. I didn't think I could even do it. I actually had to come back several times t the hospital to just cry and get a lot of the trauma out before my FMLA was over. I didn't want to see babies 12 hours a day and watch parents swoon over them or complain about how they hated having to be in the NICU. I mean I could go on forever about that. But it's been 8 months now, and with the help of supportive coworkers ive been able to handle it better and I've channeled a lot of my sadness into helping ease the suffering of the parents and the babies. I actually feel like work is a safe place even though it's just one floor above where I lost my son. 
But then....
A float nurse (coming from the float pool because we were short staffed) came and she is a big gossiper. She's really tactless and blunt. I happened to be over helping swaddle a baby, this baby had a twin and the twins' mom was next t the other baby like 10 feet away. This float nurse comes up and bluntly says, ""so how's it been since your baby died?"" I'm pretty sure my jaw hit the floor. Because it is totally inappropriate to have such a conversation at a patient bedspace. But also she didn't seem sad or caring at all, she just wanted the drama and the gossip. I wanted to just blow up on her and said ""what do you think asshole, it's been just sunshine and rainbows"". But instead I just whispered, ""umm... it's been hard?"" Then she proceeds to say, ""yeah I bet it's really hard to have to work here and see all these babies all the time"". I had to walk away at that point. I mean. I was just beside myself. Then later when I was trying to chart she said, ""yeah I bet it would be different if you had a living baby before that"". She won't even ask his name. She just calls him baby. I was so livid. I told my charge nurse later that night and I decided to write her an email the next night telling her how I felt that it was inappropriate and I was very uncomfortable and what not. Well she ended up having to come back to our floor that next night and the charge nurse basically had to tell her to come talk to me about it (which is my worst nightmare, I hate confrontation). But I felt it was the right thing to do despite how much I hate her and don't think she deserves it. Then when she apologized, she actually looked upset that she had to apologize to me.... like that was the upsetting part. She said, ""well when hard stuff happened to me, I didn't like when people walked around on eggshells around me and didn't want to talk about it."" And I'm thinking, ""there's a difference between caring and asking how someone's doing and being an outright, uncaring, asshole"". Btw... the hard things she has had to go through are having two kids with cystic fibrosis. She has three completely healthy living children with no loss.

My fiancé had been sewing clothes for her homecoming, I've built the nursery. We tried long and hard for this to happen and didn't want to get our hopes up but with each doctor visit we got confirmation that not only was she doing fine, she was exceptionally strong, excelling all tests and looked so beautiful!

At week 35 we took a trip to summer house where she was made, last trip before she arrives. The kicking that has been accompanied us for so long suddenly stopped after a few unusually active hours. We expected as much because she had not yet turned and wasnt alarmed. After all we are past the week where they could keep her alive even if she came early.

A few days later we went for a extra checkup since we were getting a little bit concerned but not alarmed. The nurse measured, then left the room, came back with doctor now and my fiance started looking to be for comfort. I could see in her eyes the fear suddenly washing over her. 

The doctor checked a bit and said. Your babys heart is not beating, I'm sorry but she is not alive. My fiancé starting shouting ""how could this be? How could this be? What do you mean?"". I sat with her for a bit and then I had to go outside to inform my mother in law who was with us. This was such a sudden chock she collapsed in my arms. Everything came crashing down around me...

We went into induced labour the next day. It was all like it should be, only we knew we were giving birth to our dear daughter. I knew better but still a part of me hoped she would come out fine and we would find the all the machine had been wrong. 

Outside the window of the room a rainbow was shining and inside my room we screamed of pain and sadness as we untangled the umbilical cord from around our daughters neck.

For two days they have kept us under observation now. My fiancé can not sleep and we both take turns calming the as the tears just never stop. I feel no purpose of living any more and try to hide this feeling from her because she needs me strong. She is missing the kicking, keeps looking at our last ultrasound 3d picture saying how perfect our daughter were because she looked like us, she looked exactly like we hoped and dreamed. Every word from my fiancés mouth breaks pieces inside of me, she deserves to be a mother, she deserves nothing of what she must go through.

I still can't understand everything that has happened. I don't know what to do and the only thing I want is to fall asleep because that is the only time I feel less. Every time I wake up I take a second to see if this was all just a bad dream, only to find it was not and then I break down again. The screams of new born babies outside our room makes me miss her so, so much!

I left for a few hours yesterday to pack away the cradle at home, pack all the baby clothes and to get the onsie we sewed for her, as that will be her burial dress. 

I'm so forlorn and scared. I don't know how to deal with this and if this indeed was our last chance I struggle to see a reason to continue living.

After all we are past the week where they could keep her alive even if she came early.</p>

<p>A few days later we went for a extra checkup since we were getting a little bit concerned but not alarmed. The nurse measured, then left the room, came back with doctor now and my fiance started looking to be for comfort. I could see in her eyes the fear suddenly washing over her. </p>

<p>The doctor checked a bit and said. Your babys heart is not beating, I&#39;m sorry but she is not alive. My fiancé starting shouting &quot;how could this be? How could this be? What do you mean?&quot;. I sat with her for a bit and then I had to go outside to inform my mother in law who was with us. This was such a sudden chock she collapsed in my arms. Everything came crashing down around me...</p>

<p>We went into induced labour the next day. It was all like it should be, only we knew we were giving birth to our dear daughter. I knew better but still a part of me hoped she would come out fine and we would find the all the machine had been wrong. </p>

<p>Outside the window of the room a rainbow was shining and inside my room we screamed of pain and sadness as we untangled the umbilical cord from around our daughters neck.</p>

<p>For two days they have kept us under observation now. My fiancé can not sleep and we both take turns calming the as the tears just never stop. I feel no purpose of living any more and try to hide this feeling from her because she needs me strong. She is missing the kicking, keeps looking at our last ultrasound 3d picture saying how perfect our daughter were because she looked like us, she looked exactly like we hoped and dreamed. Every word from my fiancés mouth breaks pieces inside of me, she deserves to be a mother, she deserves nothing of what she must go through.</p>

<p>I still can&#39;t understand everything that has happened. I don&#39;t know what to do and the only thing I want is to fall asleep because that is the only time I feel less. Every time I wake up I take a second to see if this was all just a bad dream, only to find it was not and then I break down again. The screams of new born babies outside our room makes me miss her so, so much!</p>

<p>I left for a few hours yesterday to pack away the cradle at home, pack all the baby clothes and to get the onsie we sewed for her, as that will be her burial dress. </p>

<p>I&#39;m so forlorn and scared. I don&#39;t know how to deal with this and if this indeed was our last chance I struggle to see a reason to continue living.</p>

<p>If there was anything I could do to change the past I would in a heartbeat, the heartbeat my daughter is missing! </p>

I've been told not to eat or drink the after midnight the night before. I'm supposed to go in 2 hrs before my scheduled procedure. Is that when I'll take a pill (or pill in vagina) to soften my cervix? Will I be in a pre-op private room or back to the waiting room? Will I be cramping? Will my husband be able to to be with me during those 2 hours? (If not, I might send him home.) Do they shave you? Were there a ton of people in the Sx room? Did you feel like cattle waiting your turn? Thanks.

Edit: Thanks so much for sharing, everyone! I will add my experience after my procedure.

Edit: It's the day after my D&E, so here's my experience. I arrived at the hospital 2 hours early. At registration, I was told my co-pay would be $250, which I was glad I could just get a bill for. Then went to Surgery to check-in. I was called back pretty immediately, and my partner was allowed to come in with me. The pre-op area was one of those areas where there's a large center ""nursing station"", and around the edges are sort of private rooms. It's like separating side walls and large glass slider/curtain in front. The woman who took me back took my vitals and told me how to change. The transition from ""regular person"" to ""patient"" was super weird, and I was in my hospital gown sitting in a chair, and nurse had to ask me to get up on the bed. :P Then my pre-op nurse came in to hook up my IV. Waited maybe half an hour, then the anesthesiologist and OR nurse came to ask a few questions. Then my doc came in to explain all the risks again (same as pre-op office visit). [i specifically asked for one last ultrasound, so he rolled one down from L&D and we also did that during this time]. Then it was my turn to get wheeled in. My gurney got rolled right next to the OR bed, they had me sit up for them to untie me, then I scootched myself over, now with my butt directly on the sheet. They laid my arms wide, which felt weird like a sacrificial way. In the room was my doctor, anesthesiologist, OR nurse, and 1 more person who I hadn't met before (she's the one who had me scootch down, put my hat on). Anyway, I went out quick, then woke up in recovery. I immediately started crying from the loss. The recovery nurse was very nice. She gave me an antibiotic, water, and crackers (which I threw up on the way home). After my okay, she called for my partner to join me. She took care of paperwork with me, helped me change, and wheeled me out to where my husband was now waiting with the car.

Quick thoughts based on what I've read about others' experiences:

- I did not have to take pre-meds night before or during the 2 hour wait to soften my cervix or anything like that. My doc said that's an older practice that hasn't proven to be beneficial.

- I did not take an anti-anxiety med

- ultrasound (to confirm MC, as an example), is not standard at my hospital. i had to make a specific request

- your doc may not know about release of remains to you or funeral home, but they'll figure it out after asking L&D, who have more experience with it

- I thought arriving 2 hours early would be long and boring (brought tablet, podcasts, etc), but there's actually not a long downtime period.",[],False,,0,False,PRE-d&c experiences?

Or so I thought.

When we showed up, MIL and SIL were sitting at the table sewing cloth diapers. I felt like I couldn't breathe. I wanted to run away. I stepped back to gather myself and I hear SIL say ""lol why are you hiding jokersmadlove"". We spent the next 2 hours sitting at the table watching them sew cloth diapers.

The whole family knows about our miscarriage. This is the second Mothers Day I have gone through since the MC without getting pregnant again. They know this and yet they still chose to continue sewing in front of us. Acting as if nothing is wrong. I'm sure SIL noticed that I couldn't look her in the eyes, but I don't even care at this point if she thought I was rude.

My husband has tried to be strong through everything but even he broke on the way home. He said that he doesn't understand his family. Either they still know about the miscarriage and didn't care enough to consider our feelings, or they completely forgot it even happened. Both scenarios hurt.

I know that loss can be an awkward topic for some. Maybe they are afraid of making us sad by bringing it up. Why can't you ask if we are ok? We are not ok. We could really use someone to talk to.

My first pregnancy. I had a near perfect pregnancy, ate right, did yoga/exercised throughout, never drank/smoked, did all the testing, even amnio and baby was always fine.

At 34 weeks, my doc made me get steroid shots to boost babies lungs since they thought ""he will arrive early - no later than 36 or 37 weeks probably"" and was put on bedrest. The weeks passed and I had horribly increasing searing pain in my back and some period cramps. The docs always said I was fine and that it was normal and would use a heart doppler every appointment - baby's heart was always strong. I would go in weekly and baby had dropped and I was 80% effaced since 34 weeks but not dilating. It hurt to walk, that's how low the baby was. My doc commented at 38 weeks, ""I've never seen a baby so low last this long without being born"" and said they'd induce me around 41 weeks if baby still wasn't here. Well, every week passed and nothing. At 39+3, I felt my baby hiccup in the morning (he always hiccuped) and less movement throughout the day. I had my 39 week ob appointment the next morning, where the doctor could not find my baby's heartbeat. There are no proper words that can describe what I felt at that moment. I started to cry and had to drive to the hospital to labor and delivery. It was confirmed my baby died, that it was ""horrible luck,"" and worse, they said, ""You have to have your baby now.""

I was induced and given pitocin. I labored for a few hours, horrible contractions not even a minute apart and got an epidural and spinal tap. I had the best labor ever - I only pushed 1.5 times and baby came out - not a single tear at all. I would recommend the epidural to everyone as contractions are painful - it was the only thing that helped me get through the trauma of what I was going through - and the pain. Also, after not having a drink for so long, it was so nice to feel ""high"" from the epidural. I went from screaming/crying to feeling amazing physically (and loopy). My baby was born some 6 or 7 hours later, 5 lbs, 11 lz, 20.5"" long, beautiful baby boy with the most golden blonde hair I've ever seen. He was still warm and beautiful. I held him for a long time, rocked him, kissed him and enjoyed the few hours I had with him. We had our family come and hold him, too. It was so sad and yet I felt so much joy and pride in my baby boy - he was perfect with a little button nose and long fingers/feet. I never got to see him open his eyes, hold onto my finger or hear him cry after feeling him every day for months.

While I was laboring, I could hear other babies being born in the hallway, crying and it was absolutely the worst day of my life. We had just installed his carseat the morning before, sterilized his bottles and hung up the last of his washed clothes the day before. While laboring, I was asked if we were going to cremate or bury our son, if we wanted an autopsy, etc. We buried him 2 weeks later. We were and still have never been given any reason for why this happened. It wasn't a cord issue, it wasn't a placental abruption - baby had no issue, which is why this has been even harder to accept. I couldn't get out of bed for 2 weeks. It hits me in waves all the time, the reality of what has happened and I truly would not wish this on my worst enemy. While all the new parents walked out of the hospital with their new babies, in our same stroller/carseat that we'd bought, we had to leave our baby in the morgue. As I picked out his funeral plot at the cemetery, I still had his carseat in the back of my car. Coming home to a nursery without a baby, and all his bottles on the counter still, was the most horrific and tragic thing ever. I had 3 baby showers and was given so many gifts for him. I think over 70 items were purchased from his registry. I haven't had the heart to take his nursery down and still cry every day and it's been 7 weeks now. Yesterday for mother's day, I went to take him flowers at the cemetery. It's a strange thing to be a childless mother.
I honestly feel that had I been induced earlier, this would not have happened. The doctors told me he was so low all the time and did nothing. I was always waiting for contractions to be minutes apart and it never happened but I now think that all my back pain was my contractions (back labor?). The docs always told me I was fine though.

To add insult to injury, my breasts leaked forever, I bled so much, all the physical reminders and I've not been able to lose the 20 lbs I put on. My pregnancy was one of the happiest times of my entire life and I am now living one of my saddest. I usually find comfort in prayer/God but that has all been thrown in the trash. I find no solace in that. My doctor told me at my postpartum appointment that he had ""no doubt"" that had I been induced earlier, baby would still be here. :(
I am posting this story because my beautiful boy existed in me for so long and I loved him, knew his patterns, felt him, experienced so much joy with him. All I wanted was to have him. I feel a huge void and as if I had nothing to look forward to. My hubby's father died 2 weeks before our son which has been hard on him. I want to try again but I am so terrified of this recurring. This happens less than 1% of the time in pregnancy. No matter if I ever do fall pregnant again, I know I will be terrified the entire time and the naivety I had over pregnancy with a happy ending is gone. Had this happened early in my pregnancy or even in the middle, I would feel different. But to have had it all go away at the finish line was so heartbreaking. It is the great tragedy of my life.

Who wouldn't be dreading their very first Mother's Day as a mom when their child won't be alive for it? How many women spend their first Mother's Day as a mom without any live children? It's horrible.

The day before Mother's Day, I got a message from a friend in Canada. (I live in the US.) She told me that she was thinking of me and that I was just as much a mother as other moms being celebrated. I cried. It meant so much to me to have her say that. That same day, another friend of mine gave me a cute planter of carnations. She didn't have any fancy words to say, but the action was so appreciated. I told her and another friend why I loved the gift and why carnations meant something to me. I had heard, probably somewhere on reddit, that carnations symbolize a mother's love because they don't lose their petals as they die. So if mothers are carnations, then we all still have our petals (children). I really like that symbolism, and I think carnations are my new favorite flowers.

I also read up on the founding of Mother's Day. Ann Jarvis is considered the founder. She had thirteen children, and only four of them survived to adulthood. I was floored. 9 losses. This woman advocated for children's health by holding ""Mothers' Day Work Clubs"" to improve health and sanitary conditions in a time when infants and children died much more commonly than they do now. After Ann died, her daughter helped it become a national holiday in the US. She later regretted it, and protested it, because it had become so commercialized and lost much of the original meaning. 

Learning some of this really made me stronger for Mother's Day. I went to church, but still skipped out on the service because my pastor likes to show videos with terrible songs and lots of clip art, and I didn't want to hear about how much we should appreciate our mothers because of all the stuff they do for us. *eye roll* Don't get me wrong, I love my mom. I appreciate her, and I bought her flowers even though I didn't expect any from her. But in the end we choose to have our children, and getting special attention for taking care of the human you chose to make, doesn't seem all that important when I was denied my right to do those things.

After church, I went to a family lunch with my husband, and I had a nice time. Luckily, I'm the oldest and none of my siblings have chosen to procreate yet. I wasn't triggered or depressed, and I have never appreciated my six siblings as much as I did then. Then my husband told me he had a surprise for me. My 17-year-old sister came out with a beautiful painting of my Raffael. The likeness is incredible! I was going to post the picture, but I wasn't sure if that was against the rules, so I didn't. If it's allowed, I might edit and paste a link. 

Anyway, I wanted to affirm the motherhood of each and every woman on this subreddit. I got lucky this Mother's Day and didn't have to deal with family drama or triggers or anything. But I know many of you did. You don't deserve that. You are a mother, and you deserve to be loved and taken care of. Please accept my virtual carnations as a gift to you.

After the shittiest start to the year with my MMC, I decided to remove myself from FB on Saturday because of all the pregnancy/new baby announcements. Every time I saw one, even after I think I'm moving on and doing ok, makes me slip into a horrible depressive state where I am in tears for hours and unable to sleep and function normally. 

I am also on day number.... 43 of my cycle with no discernible period for May in sight, after a three week period from hell at the start of April, after two and a half months of nothing after my D&C in January. And before anyone asks... no I'm not pregnant, I checked today.

I feel like my body is completely broken and I have no idea when I would be ovulating so the thought of even trying is ultra stressful and I am kicking myself that we didn't try starting for kids sooner (I'm 33 today so some great birthday this is... not!) so that we could deal with all this bullshit if it had come up.

It's been almost a week since we found out our baby boy's heart had stopped beating at 9 weeks. There were no outward signs or bleeding. He was perfect and so were the numbers. There was no warning or explanation. Our 9 week ultrasound appointment turned around our lives in less than ten minutes. I had my D&C yesterday. We are trying to look towards the future. 

There was a lot of good and bad from the whole experience. DH and I still cry randomly in public places when we are reminded of Basha. I've cried so much, I don't know why my body can't produce progesterone like it does watery tears and snot. The surgery experience itself was not too bad, but someone let in a pro-lifer chaplain right before I went into surgery and she grilled me on what I thought my baby's remains would look like in a box after the D&C suction. Obviously that was incredibly traumatizing and they kicked her out to wheel me into the OR. I woke up in a recovery room crying hysterically for someone to please let me see and hold my baby, or be kind and put me out again. (They sedated me with Xanax and Oxycodone and I quieted down after the anesthesia wore off.)

We decided that we just could not let Basha go as ""medical waste"" . We are going to be going through a company called ""Life Gem"" to turn his ashes into a diamond to put as a peek-a-boo stone on my wedding ring. (So that his stone touches the vein directly on the left hand.)

 But, I did find out I was RH negative and got the shot. I got progesterone supplements and a new wonderful Ob-gyn team. My tubes are clear, and my uterus was scraped from any endometriosis scarring. 

We are both 27 years old and the doctors are super hopeful that we can become pregnant quickly on our own within the next few cycles. Currently I'm still bleeding from the D&C and can't have sex. They told us to use condoms after I stop bleeding. Of course, grief and the repulsion I feel from my empty baby belly is pretty effective from stopping initiation to begin with. 

We are trying to keep things positive in between crying and asking the universe why. We are trying to think of things to look forward to within the next six weeks before we get the green light. It seems so long of a wait! We are really ready to go, but we have to figure out some way to occupy the time.

99,2048,confidence,<praw.reddit.Reddit object at 0x7f12a630cd90>,,ttcafterloss,"I realize this question is very open ended and very personal.  Just wondering whether any of you had been in a similar situation and what you decided to do.  In case it matters, I turned 35 earlier this year.  Personally, I can make peace with not having children if it doesn't work out, but I know my husband wants kids so I want to do all that I can to understand what's going on with my body.  The only way I can really do that is being proactive about collecting data (temping) that can be presented to an OB/RE/whoever in case it helps with diagnoses.  Or maybe I simply need to feel like I'm in control even if I really am not, I don't know.

Anyway, husband and I have been actively TTC since January.  We had a positive (using a digital test) the first month, but lost the pregnancy at exactly 5 weeks.  We waited one cycle before resuming TTC, and got a barely-there positive on a dip test, but lost it at 4+3.  We didn't wait a cycle after that and just tried again right away.  For the third attempt I got two faint but definite positives along with all the same symptoms as the first pregnancy before my period was supposed to start, then at 4+1 I started spotting.  Two days later at what would have been 4+3 I started bleeding heavily.  I'm currently on CD4 after the most recent CP.

So now it's been two, maybe three CPs within 4 months, each of them ending under 5 weeks.  I only went to see my OB after the very first pregnancy loss, and she suggested I relax and stop stressing about getting pregnant.  She recommended that husband and I take a trip somewhere, chill, and don't worry about the whole baby-making business because the stress is likely not helping the situation.  Instead of relaxing per her advice, I did some research and decided to start temping sometime in the middle of the cycle that led up to the second CP.

Well, a two-week trip is coming up.  I won't be taking any of the OPK stuff, but did plan on continuing to temp.

Just wondering whether any of you had been in a similar situation and what you decided to do.  In case it matters, I turned 35 earlier this year.  Personally, I can make peace with not having children if it doesn&#39;t work out, but I know my husband wants kids so I want to do all that I can to understand what&#39;s going on with my body.  The only way I can really do that is being proactive about collecting data (temping) that can be presented to an OB/RE/whoever in case it helps with diagnoses.  Or maybe I simply need to feel like I&#39;m in control even if I really am not, I don&#39;t know.</p>

<p>Anyway, husband and I have been actively TTC since January.  We had a positive (using a digital test) the first month, but lost the pregnancy at exactly 5 weeks.  We waited one cycle before resuming TTC, and got a barely-there positive on a dip test, but lost it at 4+3.  We didn&#39;t wait a cycle after that and just tried again right away.  For the third attempt I got two faint but definite positives along with all the same symptoms as the first pregnancy before my period was supposed to start, then at 4+1 I started spotting.  Two days later at what would have been 4+3 I started bleeding heavily.  I&#39;m currently on CD4 after the most recent CP.</p>

<p>So now it&#39;s been two, maybe three CPs within 4 months, each of them ending under 5 weeks.  I only went to see my OB after the very first pregnancy loss, and she suggested I relax and stop stressing about getting pregnant.  She recommended that husband and I take a trip somewhere, chill, and don&#39;t worry about the whole baby-making business because the stress is likely not helping the situation.  Instead of relaxing per her advice, I did some research and decided to start temping sometime in the middle of the cycle that led up to the second CP.</p>

<p>Well, a two-week trip is coming up.  I won&#39;t be taking any of the OPK stuff, but did plan on continuing to temp.  My husband thinks I should just leave the thermometer at home and relax, but didn&#39;t object to me wanting to continue temping if it would make me feel better.  By the time we come back it will be about time for the next cycle to start assuming I&#39;m not pregnant again.  What are your thoughts?</p>

I'm TTC with PCOS after a miscarriage mid-April. AF returned right after my miscarriage bleeding (4/9-4/25), so counting cycle days is tough this cycle. My final HCG was negative on 4/25 after being positive 4/19 (33) & 4/17 (201), so I don't know exactly when CD1 was for me. This has made CM watching, BBT temping, & OPKs far more frustrating than they already were. I have no idea if I'm on CD13, CD17, somewhere in between, or another CD entirely. 


Saw my OB 4/4 & was approved to start trying after my miscarriage, so we've been trying daily since then, but it sure would be nice to know when I'm actually ovulating before my next AF!


I thought I ovulated on 4/4 due to EWCM on 4/3 & 4/4 with a temp drop 4/4, but my OPKs were negative. Now I have EWCM again on 4/7 (with a little 4/6), but far less than a few days ago, & mismatched positive/negative OPKs.
