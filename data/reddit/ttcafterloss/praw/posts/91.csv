After a dnc which caused uterine scarring and irregular periods, I had to do a hysteroscopy procedure.

I had no trouble getting pregnant 6 years ago with our daughter. I was one of those obnoxious people who got pregnant on our practice try, literally 2 weeks after stopping my birth control pills. I figured, oh wow, we must be really fertile, cool. I had my IUD for just under 5 years and I got it removed in June of last year, did birth control pills in June and July, and stopped in August to start trying for a second. We tried for 4 months, and then got pregnant. We lost the baby to a MMC on January 10. I can't even deal with the feelings of devastation that thinking about that is bringing up today, so I can't talk about it.

 I had a weird period in February (lasted for 5 hours, that's it) that was preceded by a LH spike, and the cervical mucus. And then I ovulated early on CD 9 right after that, so we missed that ovulation. Had a normal period for March so I though, okay cool, looks like things are back to normal! We can try again.

 I started doing my LH strips again and I had a sudden spike from .47 to .94, and then CD13 was .95 and that day I had the EWCM. The next day was the highest peak I've ever had and it was 1.64!! Then, it went back down to .96 and then back to .39. I figured, holy hell, a spike like that, I had to have ovulated. Since a few days after that, I've been nauseous, my boobs have been hurting, I feel swollen, and I'm exhausted. I figured awesome, we finally got it, we're going to get our rainbow! So I got up early today (9DPO) and peed in my little cup and I did the strip... And it's a big fucking negative. I was going off of the EWCM to count DPO. 

I'm just discouraged and depressed and so fucking angry. I'm letting my husband sleep so i can delay telling him. I just feel fucking broken. Like this was so fucking easy the first time.

So I got up early today (9DPO) and peed in my little cup and I did the strip... And it&#39;s a big fucking negative. I was going off of the EWCM to count DPO. </p>

<p>I&#39;m just discouraged and depressed and so fucking angry. I&#39;m letting my husband sleep so i can delay telling him. I just feel fucking broken. Like this was so fucking easy the first time. Why can&#39;t my body cooperate now? Why can&#39;t I have another baby? What did I do wrong?</p>

It feels more appropriate here.

About three weeks ago i struggled through my 3rd consecutive miscarriage. I am scared I may never have children. 

On March 8th I had my 3rd pregnancy loss at 9 weeks. The longest duration of any of my pregnancies. It was honestly so painful. Physically and emotionally. 

My boyfriend and I were very happy by the surprise. We are not trying for a baby but are not exactly preventing it either. We saw the heartbeat at 7 weeks. We were told everything looked healthy and normal. 

Then for a day or two I felt nothing. No sore breast no cravings and no sickness. All things I was feeling before. Then that was it. Gone in a single breath. 

I lost my first in February of 2014 at around 5 weeks. I was younger at the time and thought nothing of it. Then in November of 2017 I miscarried again at 6-7 weeks. I didn't even know I was pregnant until I went to the hospital and they told me I was losing my baby. 

At this time i was about 20 and was concerned. OB said I have PCOS and this affects my ability to get pregnant. Problem is, I am getting pregnant but not staying that way. 

With basic insurance I really have no options. I met with an OB who wanted to do tests but with the virus commotion right now it is all on hold. They did check my ovaries which besides a cyst look fine, and my uterus is normal so they tell me. My boyfriend got his sperm tested and they're all good other than a lower than average count.

I was told my 3rd loss could be due to my blood type (rh negative) and my body probably rejected the pregnancy. That if i had gotten some shot it may not have happened. I don't know how true this is. I looked into it and it is a strange explanation. 

I'm so sad and so scared. I know I am still young but the fact that my young body doesn't work right is what scares me. I hear the same stories from women in their 30s not people my own age. 

My boyfriend and I want to try again in a few months. We were so ready for this little one. I am just scared that it will just happen over and over again. Or that i may never be able to carry to term. 


I have read on here some miracle stories. A lot of them with ivf or just a miracle baby. I do not have the resources to get fertility treatments. I just wanted to get this off my chest. 

It feels so strange. To be in this somewhat limbo. The possibility that I may never have a family of my home really bums me out. Id love to be a mommy one day.

<p>It feels so strange. To be in this somewhat limbo. The possibility that I may never have a family of my home really bums me out. Id love to be a mommy one day. All i can hope is that when the time is right ill have a beautiful rainbow baby.</p>

The OB/GYN suggested we go straight to reproductive endocrinologist because it seems something prevents me from staying pregnant early on and my med history is too complex for ob/gyn generalists. I get that OB/GYNs aren't there to help you get and stay pregnant -- they're there for more routine monitoring and delivery. She said that if I get past 8 weeks, I will probably be referred back to the ob/gyn practice and they will bring in a MFM consultant to follow me through. That's all fine and makes sense to me. 

What I'm not sure about is whether or not I should stop TTC (by starting birth control pills) until I consult with the repro endo next month. This was suggested by the OB I think mainly to avoid additional heartbreak, and by the repro endo nurse to prep for IVF cycling in case we end up needing to try that route. I have already undergone extensive workups in gynecology, hematology, rheumatology, and genetics. They have never identified autoimmune markers, uterine malformations, blood disorders, or any significant genetic findings that could lead to infertility. 

We have previously seen the repro endo because we were considering genetic screening for 2 mutations I am a carrier for (but luckily my husband is not) and that could be responsible for some of my health problems, but after consulting with several geneticists about the risk to our offspring we decided there wasn't enough evidence to go through preimplantation testing/IVF, and to TTC on our own.

A little backstory:

We found ourselves unexpectedly (and thrillingly) pregnant in September 2019. A miscarriage at 10 weeks triggered a massive depressive episode in me, and I was fired from my job in November. It’s been rough, but I’ve been certainly on the upswing the last month or so. We have recently been talking about trying again. And while not trying, we haven’t been preventing this month.

I literally told my husband Tuesday that it wasn’t going to happen this month. I’ve been passively tracking my periods at least, and we were fully several days after the ovulation my app predicted. But of course, those things can be notoriously wrong. Or maybe I’m just telling myself what I’d like to hear.

My app predicts my period in six days. It’s been a few days early in its predicting the last few months. Last night I noticed that my nipples were very, very sensitive. And this morning I noticed something that could be implantation bleeding. 

Please tell me I’m crazy, that I’m interpreting things in a manner that tells me what I want to hear. I am sure I’ll get my period in a week, and I’ll feel silly. But the next six/seven days will be incredibly difficult, trying not to hope, especially right now, when all we need is hope for anything.",t2_5ge47tbp,False,,0,False,Interrupting early signs,[],r/ttcafterloss,False,0,question,0,,,False,t3_fpg7be,False,dark,1.0,,public,3,0,{},,,False,[],,False,False,,{},Question,False,3,,False,self,False,,[],{},,True,,1585274250.0,text,0,,,text,self.ttcafterloss,False,"<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=""md""><p>*Interpreting</p>

American Horror Story: GYNO

I have experienced an OBGYN straight from the depths of hell..

Tw: mention of loss.

I just got off the phone with my OBGYN, i scheduled a phone call weeks ago to go over our next steps. I had an early loss on Valentine’s Day, i took two tests and got my blood tested, my HCG was 7. 

She started out by confirming what had happened “so you got a positive pregnancy test then started bleeding shortly after?” Then said that I must have had a false positive and she wouldn’t count this as a pregnancy/miscarriage and i shouldn’t either because “no one wants to be in that category” she said that there’s a hormone that circulates in your body that turns the test positive but you’re not pregnant, she said that an egg just looks at a sperm and this hormone circulates because we want to be pregnant so badly. Since my blood test was 7 it doesn’t “count” (she said this multiple times). She said 0-5 is negative, 5-25 is inconclusive and 25+ is positive. She told me to not stress because then i wouldn’t get pregnant because, you know, cortisol. She said 1 in 4 pregnancies end in miscarriage and since people test sooo early it’s probably more like 1 in 2 but most of those people get false positives as well. She said that i should wait a week after my missed period to test so this doesn’t happen again.

I was crying really hard at this point but just trying to get through the conversation.

She went on to say that even IF it was a super super super early loss, then at least we know that everything is working right and that I’ll get pregnant. She told me that if other doctors or anyone asks me if I’ve ever had a pregnancy, i should say no or say 0 because i was never pregnant. She said that documented pregnancies don’t happen until 6-8 weeks and that’s a “real miscarriage”. 

I mustered up some words and said “so what are our next steps” she said i should wait until 12-14 months then the first thing would be to get my husbands sperm tested then after that i would get an ultrasound, then a really expensive test where they “shove dye through my tubes”. I said “we don’t care about the money we just want a child” she said well then that wouldn’t apply to you. 

I now, can’t stop crying and I’m questioning everything. Have i been moping around this whole time thinking that I had a miscarriage when I really just wanted to be pregnant so bad that my body faked the HCG? How could a doctor that does this every day say such hurtful things and minimize every emotion I’ve had.. she never once said sorry, she never once considered my emotions.

I am lost, I’m angry, I’m upset, I’m heartbroken. And most of all, I’m not pregnant and no one seems to want to help me get there. I will not be returning to this doctor and I will attempt to file a complaint.",t2_4pz979a0,False,,0,False,Cross posted from TFAB,[],r/ttcafterloss,False,0,trigger,0,,,False,t3_fkv08w,False,dark,1.0,,public,6,0,{},,,False,[],,False,False,,{},Trigger - mention of loss,False,6,,False,self,False,,[],{},,True,,1584586848.0,text,0,,,text,self.ttcafterloss,False,"<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=""md""><p>I just posted this in TFAB but thought this group would be helpful too..</p>

My husband and I had been trying to get pregnant for a little over 4 months. To our surprise and delight, we conceived on what we thought was an “off” cycle with bad timing. I found out I was pregnant on Valentine’s Day. After one month of being elated, we went to what was supposed to be our first prenatal appointment and 8 week ultrasound yesterday. Though this is my first pregnancy and I am new to ultrasounds, I knew from seeing many 7-8 week scans that what was showing on the screen wasn’t normal. A gestational sac and nothing within. The tech was unable to find the fetal pole or heartbeat. After speaking with my doctor about how this is likely not a viable pregnancy I am sent to the lab to check hcg, progesterone, and TSH. After discussing medical management to start the process of miscarrying, I know that there is no chance of this pregnancy progressing. 

My doctor said I would likely get my period 4-6 weeks later, and that we could try again after that. Thinking about going back to tracking my temperature, cervical fluid, OPKs again just makes me want to scream. I don’t even know if that will be effective given all the hormonal changes to come. I would love to hear anyone’s experience or tips with tracking after a loss. 

I am angry and sad that after months of trying, we finally get a positive pregnancy test only to discover that it basically never developed. I am devastated to see my husband cry. He was so excited about this pregnancy. I am shocked that this almost exact scenario happened to a close friend (who was in my wedding party) just 6 weeks ago.

History: D&C when I was 15 (2001). Failed attempt to treat MMC by medical management at around 12 weeks followed by haemorraging and emergency D&C (Summer 2019). Diagnosis of incompetent cervix, 5cm dilated at 19+0, 2 weeks ago, followed by emergency stitch. Almost two weeks hospital bed rest but heavy bleeding and clots started on Thursday. Went into labour Saturday and delivered our beautiful baby son at 22.56, 20+4. He spent a few precious minutes with us before passing away.


I am 34 and in the UK, my local hospital is specialist in preterm prevention. 


Any help any guidance please I am so desperate.


1. We are going ahead with a full postmortem (autopsy). We owe him answers. We spent most of Sunday with our boy taking as many photos as we could, handprints and footprints and I held and snuggled with him. We saw him again yesterday for 50 minutes and we have the option maybe to see him again today but I don't know if I should? Today may be our last chance before the PM goes ahead, which may take 2-3 weeks. They have promised we can see him again before the funeral but I don't know if that is going to be enough.


2. How long will the bleeding last for? When will I get my period back and can I ovulate before does anyone know? They gave me a drug to stop my milk coming in could that affect it? I am desperate to start trying again. Anything else I can do to improve our chances it took 3months ish to conceive our boy last time.


3. They said in the hospital it would be 6 weeks before my check up but we read the discharge letter and it says 12 weeks. I can't wait that long to start trying again what the hell do we do my midwife didn't know.


4. I know they will probably have to put in a preventative stitch in if we are able to conceive but does anyone know if having had a late miscarriage is more likely to cause another early miscarriage? Critically they don't know if the IC that caused this was caused by an infection (I had small amounts of infection markers in my blood but asymptomatic. I am now on antibiotics) or the two D&C that I've had.



I will ask these questions and more to official providers but I am not currently getting in front of the right people. I am desperate to put this right for my boy, my Thomas John William. Is there anyone out there who can help with any of the above?

I have short LPs. With the last two pregnancies my period has started before I got a positive HPT. I can't think that's not related at least in part. How could an embryo grow with reduced lining? And how many possible pregnancies have I lost through early shedding? 

Anyway, I'm considering asking my Dr for a progesterone rx. After the second loss, when I brought up short LPs she said (I'm paraphrasing) ""that's not a thing, but I'll prescribe you progesterone if you want"". I said no at the time, but after reading the prism study (which I learned about here) I'm thinking of going ahead.

Hi everyone, I shared this with my Bumpers group and someone advised to share here too. 

As a bit of background, I'm a FTM currently 35w pregnant and based in the UK. My hubby is my best friend and the greatest support I could dream of. We are not British but we are lucky to be surrounded by my brother and amazing friends that have shown themselves to be like family by taking care of us and making sure we are not alone and that we are ok.

\_\_\_\_

We’re almost certain we are losing our baby...

On Wednesday I went for my regular 34w midwife appointment; as my bump was (again) measuring small, she referred me to a growth scan the following day. It’s relevant to say that here in the UK you don’t get any scans after 20w unless something needs checking.

I asked hubby to join me for this one and we were concerned but thinking maybe I didn’t have much amniotic fluid or maybe baby needed to come a bit earlier. During the scan the ultrasound technician told us that the growth was alright, baby was alright, but then they saw a big black spot in his brain, occupying almost a quarter of it... I looked at hubby and we kinda knew... they called in another senior technician and they took the images to show the OB. They didn’t tell us anything besides that is seemed to be a large pool of fluid and asked us to come back later that day for a second scan with the OB.

With the OB, she showed us that baby was measuring quite small actually, the little legs only 31w, the tummy around 30w... she also showed us that there were two pools of fluid in baby’s brain, one on each side, measuring 18mm and 21mm. We were explained that it’s normal to have spinal fluid in our brain, but the normal is under 9mm. Anything between 11mm and 13mm is considered severe. Our baby has much more than that. The five possible diagnosis we were given are one worse than the other, with the best one being an infection I might have passed. Even if that is the case, more than a quarter of our little one’s brain never developed.

Where we stand: We have been referred to a specialist hospital in London. On Monday they are going to do more scans and probably an MRI. A diagnosis is not confirmed but the hopes of this being nothing are almost none. Almost likely, the OB said, this is one of those genetic abnormalities not tested during the 12w tests. The 20w scan also didn’t show anything...

We know that even with a diagnosis, our little one’s chances of not suffering are very small. Who knows if he will have developmental or learning difficulties, how severe, of even if he’s going to make it the first day, the first hour... We don’t want him to suffer, we know what it’s best if that is the scenario we are looking at. But meanwhile we are in this horrible limbo, where my baby keeps kicking as if nothing was happening and we are battling between being broken and trying to keep a cold head to make rational decisions.

We are shocked, we are heartbroken. I have had such an easy pregnancy, only with a compact bump as I kept telling people! But then again, hubby and I were both small and healthy babies! Today was going to be our co-ed baby shower... Nothing prepared us for this...

I’m just looking for a bit of support and advice...

167,2048,confidence,<praw.reddit.Reddit object at 0x7f12a630cd90>,,ttcafterloss,"We didn’t try for pregnancy for long. We’d waited years because I struggled with massive ovarian cysts. My first cyst was 11.5 cm. I had it removed laparoscopically 6 months after we got married, along with half my ovary. 7-8 months later the familiar pain came back, and it culminated in the removal of another, larger cyst on our second wedding anniversary during a more involved, longer surgery. Life continued, and family plans got delayed. Through it I remained anxious, wondering if I’d get a cyst on my remaining ovary, if I’d feel let down by my body again, and if I was playing a game of chicken with time.

Fast forward to this December. We’d decided to try. And 10 days after I ovulated I saw the faintest of pink lines. Barely there. So pale, but so life changing.

We moved forward with excitement. Slowly sharing our secret. Seeing parents get tears in their eyes with the news and friends celebrate our joy. Our first ultrasound was perfect. I was nearly 9 weeks, our baby was perfect, and its heart so strong.

So we kept planning- the nursery in our new, under construction house, how we’d introduce our dogs to the baby, and the time they’d have with their new cousin, because we’d also found out my sister was expecting too. Just 19 days behind me.

I entered this week rounding out my first trimester. My nausea was mostly gone and my energy was returning. I was starting to look forward to the second trimester bliss everyone talked about. Then, I spotted. The tiniest bit. It wasn’t bright, heavy, or painful. And it stopped. It was so minor I decided to tell my doctor at our ultrasound 4 days later.

24 hours later I spotted again. A little heavier, a light cramp, and a small bit of bright red. I called my doctor assuming they’d tell me to monitor, but instead they sent me to the ER. 

At the ER they assured me many, many women are just fine. They took blood and urine. We waited amongst the flu stricken patients, the teenager with what sounded like pneumonia, but was clearly taking every opportunity to smoke weed outside, and the woman with the kind of long, curly nails you see on cheap reality shows. It felt surreal.

Our ultrasound tech warned me my HCG had come back low. Between her face and my husband’s I knew, and we were sent to wait for a doctor to give us official news.

9 weeks 3 days. I’d miscarries roughly 3.5 weeks before.  My doctor was fortunately on call in labor and delivery, and came down to give us options. She had to do a pelvic exam, but in the ER they’d put me in a room without stirrups, so I had to use a plastic bedpan to raise my hips. Everyone kept apologizing.

Despite being past 9 PM, my doctor offered to call in an OR team for a D&C, as I’d chosen to move forward quickly. At 10 PM I was wheeled in, and woken up 30 minutes later to painful cramps, quickly helped by pain meds. 

Because it was so late, we were the only two in the outpatient surgery ward. It brought back memories of my first surgery, when I was the last patient to go home. I hated it.

My nurse was amazing. She gave me ice chips when we realized the anesthesia mask had cut the underside of my tongue badly. She wiped the blood off my shoulder from the mouth injury. And when the pain meds made me nauseous, she rubbed peppermint oil into my back, massaging it in to relax my lower back.

We got home after midnight, still numb to the previous 7.5 hours. I ate a bit, but my mouth hurt so much I barely could.  At 3 AM I fell asleep while crying. 

My husband and I spent the last few days holding each other, crying, cracking jokes to ease the hurt. We got our report and found out I bled excessively during my procedure- over 700ml. It was controlled with medicine and uterine massage, but the massage left bruises on my abdomen.

I’m recovering, but I’m sad, numb, and angry all at once. Grieving what isn’t to be for us now, numb to the full reality of it, and angry that the whole process seems to feel like punishment. The ill equipped emergency room pelvic exam, the mouth injury that’s limited me to liquid and soft foods for three days, and the fatigue and bruises from the blood loss and ensuing interventions.  My doctor confirmed miscarriage after an ultrasound with heartbeat at nearly 9 weeks is uncommon statistically, and so is missed miscarriage. I know somebody has to be in the unlucky group- I just wished after my other surgeries we’d catch a break. 

I know it’ll get better. We’ve been very open about our experience and I’ve received messages of love from literally dozens of friends and family familiar with our pain. Still, it’s new and raw. 

We now move forward knowing we want to try again.

Hi friends,
I work in a hospital and received this cdc webinar link from the chief of staff today regarding pregnancy and covid 19. It is designed for clinicians. I haven’t watched it in full, but wanted to pass it along to folks who may be interested. 

After five months of waiting, we were finally going to try again in two weeks.  Are people putting their ttc on hold? Maybe I’ll have a better idea for myself once I watch this. Hope this helps someone.
