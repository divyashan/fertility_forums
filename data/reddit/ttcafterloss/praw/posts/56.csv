2,2048,confidence,<praw.reddit.Reddit object at 0x7f12a630cd90>,,ttcafterloss,"Hi everyone. I am finally getting the courage to post something on here. I have been wanting to for a couple weeks, but have been too nervous to actually do it. So here goes. I'm sorry if this is too much to read. I wanted to share my stillbirth story, so please don't read any further if it will upset you, and I'm sorry this is so long.
I am 35 yo and lost my baby girl, Vienna, at 28 weeks. I found out she was gone on February 19th and delivered her on February 20th. Everything was (seemingly) so normal up until the few days before I found out she was gone. I had noticed her movement had changed and wasn't as strong. I had a routine OB appt the Thursday before I found out, and at that time she had a strong heartbeat and I was measuring appropriately. My OB reassured me that she had probably just settled in to a different position and to just try to pay attention to kick counts. By the following Monday Feb 19th I was concerned so they sent me in for a non-stress test. That's when I found out she was gone. That was the most traumatic and horrible experience in my life, I won't go into the exact details here. The crazy thing is that I thought that day that I had been feeling her move more then I had, but I wasn't, it was just Braxton-Hicks or my mind playing tricks.
I don't need to describe the utter devastation. Waiting for my husband to arrive at the hospital was the longest 30 minutes of my life. He was under the assumption he was just going to be sitting with me during the 2 hr non-stress test. I was alone when I found out she was gone, and had to wait for him to get there. At delivery we found out that she had a true knot and a large stricture in her umbilical cord. She had not been growing well for at least a few weeks because she was smaller than normal. Even if something had been done the day of my OB appointment it would have already been too late. I don't know if that is solace or not, but it helps to believe that there was really nothing I could have done... or at least that's what I tell myself. 
I'm here because we are TTC again. For me there is a desperate need to be pregnant again. I feel like that is the only thing that will give me hope again. I haven't even gotten my period yet after delivery, so I'm not betting on this happening any time soon. Thank you all for reading, and I'm glad (and sad) to know there are others of you out there who can really understand.

I lost my first pregnancy at 10 weeks this past January, but our journey began a few years ago and it is becoming so difficult to keep waiting and waiting. I’m trying to believe the “it will be worth the wait” promises I hear from everyone, but I’m just feeling especially down today.

March 2016- Stopped my birth control in anticipation of TTC the upcoming summer
June 2016- After having no period for 3 months after stopping BC, had blood work done.
July 2016- Blood work results showed high prolactin levels, referred for MRI.
August 2016- Growth on pituitary gland found on MRI, referred to neurosurgeon.
September 2016- Neurosurgeon confirms benign tumor on pituitary gland, scheduled surgery 2 weeks later.
October 2016- First period in 8 months, but had just begun alternative teacher certification program. Had to delay TTC so as not to become pregnant when I would be due during my first year teaching during the 2017-2018 year.
Waiting, waiting, waiting...
September 2017- TTC officially begins
December 2017- Yay! Pregnancy!
January 2018- MMC confirmed 4 days before our first ultrasound. Told to wait 3 cycles to TTC again.
February 2018- First period comes on time, a little lighter than normal.
March 2018- Still waiting for second period, coming up on one week late (not pregnant, using protection).

I know 2 years is just a drop in the bucket compared to some journeys others are currently experiencing, I am just feeling especially impatient today. I am scared my irregular periods are the result of some underlying health issue which will result in more doctor appointments, and more waiting... I know I’ve gained weight from some stress eating the last several months with the miscarriage and school, and we are one week out from our first round of standardized testing, and the last week especially has been extra stressful every time I use the bathroom and anxiously check for my period to no avail- all of which can affect my period from coming on time...

I had been super stressed throughout this pregnancy, waiting to miscarry at any moment, cautious until last week at our perfect 12 week scan when I finally let myself believe that this could actually be happening, that this could be my happy ending. The blood tests came out great, we started announcing (due October 2nd), I bought maternity wear etc. 

I had some spotting throughout but every scan showed no problems and the cause of the bleeding was never discovered. I had a stomach ache last weekend and some bleeding on Monday so went in for a scan where I saw a strong heartbeat and my little one waving at me. 

On Tuesday my abdominal pain worsened so I went to the ER. While waiting there I went to the bathroom to throw up and then I miscarried on the bathroom floor. It was horrible and I started screaming and then there was a whole thing, it's all a blur. We got to see him (we are waiting for tests for gender confirmation) later and say goodbye, we got his tiny footprints to take home. He was so tiny but perfect. They think an infection may have been the cause of the miscarriage but we won't get the test results for weeks. 

The thing is, I have been waiting for my rainbow for 7 years now when I had my first miscarriage (mmc) discovered at 8 weeks. After two abdominal surgeries to remove fibroids, one LEEP on my cervix and one natural CP we finally tried IVF last year and went through 3 full treatment cycles. The first was unsuccessful with nothing to freeze, the second resulted in a pregnancy and miscarriage at 6 weeks and the third was a complete failure. 

We were told in December that the combination of low sperm, few eggs and my wonky uterus plus our older age (38) means that our chances are slim and we should start looking at other options. We weren't ready for that so decided to take a few months off and revisit IVF in May. 

You can imagine my surprise when I got a positive pregnancy test in January! And suddenly the world made sense and our troubles had meaning. It just seems so cruel to give us a miracle pregnancy for this long if it wasn't meant to be. 

I simultaneously feel like I won't be happy until I'm pregnant again and that I will never be able to go through this again. 

Sorry for the long post, I think I just needed to get it out. I'm back at home now, still bleeding, crying and trying miserably to cope with the grief which seems like an impossible task.

I'm super struggling with grief and feeling alone in this - the due date is also my dog's supposed birthday (and my and my partner's bdays are also on the 6th of other months, so I know I won't ever forget). I've been so weepy and irritable. How have you taken care of yourself around your due date? Any ideas on how to mark the loss or prepare for the day? 


Also, one of my really close friends just had a kiddo and another friend was getting a bunch of us to go in on a gift for them. I was talking to her about my due date and sadness and ended up explaining about some of my mixed feelings of being excited and happy for them, but also insanely angry and jealous and scared for my future pregnancies.

40,2048,confidence,<praw.reddit.Reddit object at 0x7f12a630cd90>,,ttcafterloss,"I just got back from our first recurrent pregnancy loss appointment. We're in Canada, and our RPL clinic is at our local women's hospital.  Here's a little write-up in case it's helpful to others. 

Our history:  I've had 4 losses. 

Loss 1, May/June 2017: MMC at 11 weeks, embryo measuring a little under 8 weeks.  We saw a heartbeat at 7+5, but it was low at 129 BPM. Slight spotting at 11 weeks led to investigation. Used misoprostol. 

Loss 2, July 2017:  CP immediately after first MMC.  Two days of positive tests, then nothing.  Bleeding 2 weeks later. 

Loss 3, January 2018: MMC at 9 weeks. Embryo measuring at 6+1, sac at 7+2ish. U/S a week later (10 weeks) showed embryo at 6+2ish, but no heartbeat. Used misoprostol, had eventual D&C. 

Loss 4, March 2018 :  CP.  3 days of positive but declining tests, then my period (about 3 days late). 

Today's appointment was... interesting.  We met a fellow and our doctor, who is both an OBGYN and an RE.  He has serious credentials, although a somewhat lacking bedside manner.  We learned that our second MMC had Trisomy 13, which was a bit of a trip.  I'm still processing that news. 

They did an ultrasound, which was normal (although the most uncomfortable vaginal ultrasound I've ever had, and I've had a few by now).  They have ordered a hysteroscopy, which is standard procedure.  No HSG, which is fine - my tubes are clearly open, or at least one of them. They said my ovaries looked good. I found the ongoing talk about investigating my ""cavity"" amusing. Let's fill that cavity, boys! 

Both my husband and I have had bloodwork ordered.  Bloodwork includes karyotyping for both of us.  I get basic thyroid (which I already know is normal), lupus anticoagulant, anticardiolipin antibodies, prolactin, hemoglobin A1C, TPO-ab, antiphosphatidylserine antibodies, and b2 glycoprotein 1. 

The doctor said that for now we have a good prognosis, at 70-80% chance of live birth in the next 5 years (honestly, I'm not wild about that gaping 20-30% hole, but hey, you get what you get). 

We are supposed to go back after the hysteroscopy and the initial bloodwork (everything but karyotyping). Karyotyping will take 8-12 weeks to come back, but he wants to follow up before that. 

The clinic will follow us closely with betas and ultrasounds every 2 weeks until we are 12 weeks if and when we get pregnant again.  We're not supposed to get pregnant before our follow-up (no prob bob - we played with fire last cycle and got burned). 

I was a bit stunned by the trisomy 13 news, so I feel like I didn't get a chance to ask everything I would have wanted to.  I did ask the fellow (not the doctor) about sperm dna fragmentation testing.  I have been a bit worked up about some of my husband's lifestyle choices (smoking, level of drinking)). The fellow said that typically sperm DNA fragmentation is more often used during IVF, but we could talk about it more if the other tests came back negative. 

Basically, here's the deal:  we have about a 50% chance of finding something to treat.  Some of the issues they could find are treatable, as many of you know.  Some of them are less treatable.  If our karyotypes come back abnormal (about a 2-5% chance, I think), the only treatment is IVF with PGS testing (or trying and crossing our fingers). The clinic does not do IVF, and there is no public funding for IVF here (I have friends with a rare genetic disorder whose doctors applied for special funding, to no avail). 

Overall, I feel positive (but am, of course, obsessively googling Trisomy 13 and everything else).  It helps to know that we're taking steps to move forward. I've been struggling a bit emotionally, and this feels like movement.  I was pretty into the non-medicalization of birth and and pregnancy before, but I'm over it now. Bring on the blood tests. The trisomy diagnosis has also made me determined to have an NIPT test if and when the time comes (which we did not want to pursue during our last pregnancy). 

Let me know if you have any questions or advice! I'll follow up with results when we have them.

<p>Loss 1, May/June 2017: MMC at 11 weeks, embryo measuring a little under 8 weeks.  We saw a heartbeat at 7+5, but it was low at 129 BPM. Slight spotting at 11 weeks led to investigation. Used misoprostol. </p>

<p>Loss 2, July 2017:  CP immediately after first MMC.  Two days of positive tests, then nothing.  Bleeding 2 weeks later. </p>

<p>Loss 3, January 2018: MMC at 9 weeks. Embryo measuring at 6+1, sac at 7+2ish. U/S a week later (10 weeks) showed embryo at 6+2ish, but no heartbeat. Used misoprostol, had eventual D&amp;C. </p>

<p>Loss 4, March 2018 :  CP.  3 days of positive but declining tests, then my period (about 3 days late). </p>

<p>Today&#39;s appointment was... interesting.  We met a fellow and our doctor, who is both an OBGYN and an RE.  He has serious credentials, although a somewhat lacking bedside manner.  We learned that our second MMC had Trisomy 13, which was a bit of a trip.  I&#39;m still processing that news. </p>

<p>They did an ultrasound, which was normal (although the most uncomfortable vaginal ultrasound I&#39;ve ever had, and I&#39;ve had a few by now).  They have ordered a hysteroscopy, which is standard procedure.  No HSG, which is fine - my tubes are clearly open, or at least one of them. They said my ovaries looked good. I found the ongoing talk about investigating my &quot;cavity&quot; amusing. Let&#39;s fill that cavity, boys! </p>

<p>Both my husband and I have had bloodwork ordered.  Bloodwork includes karyotyping for both of us.  I get basic thyroid (which I already know is normal), lupus anticoagulant, anticardiolipin antibodies, prolactin, hemoglobin A1C, TPO-ab, antiphosphatidylserine antibodies, and b2 glycoprotein 1. </p>

<p>The doctor said that for now we have a good prognosis, at 70-80% chance of live birth in the next 5 years (honestly, I&#39;m not wild about that gaping 20-30% hole, but hey, you get what you get). </p>

<p>We are supposed to go back after the hysteroscopy and the initial bloodwork (everything but karyotyping). Karyotyping will take 8-12 weeks to come back, but he wants to follow up before that. </p>

<p>The clinic will follow us closely with betas and ultrasounds every 2 weeks until we are 12 weeks if and when we get pregnant again.  We&#39;re not supposed to get pregnant before our follow-up (no prob bob - we played with fire last cycle and got burned). </p>

<p>I was a bit stunned by the trisomy 13 news, so I feel like I didn&#39;t get a chance to ask everything I would have wanted to.  I did ask the fellow (not the doctor) about sperm dna fragmentation testing.  I have been a bit worked up about some of my husband&#39;s lifestyle choices (smoking, level of drinking)). The fellow said that typically sperm DNA fragmentation is more often used during IVF, but we could talk about it more if the other tests came back negative. </p>

<p>Basically, here&#39;s the deal:  we have about a 50% chance of finding something to treat.  Some of the issues they could find are treatable, as many of you know.  Some of them are less treatable.  If our karyotypes come back abnormal (about a 2-5% chance, I think), the only treatment is IVF with PGS testing (or trying and crossing our fingers). The clinic does not do IVF, and there is no public funding for IVF here (I have friends with a rare genetic disorder whose doctors applied for special funding, to no avail). </p>

<p>Overall, I feel positive (but am, of course, obsessively googling Trisomy 13 and everything else).  It helps to know that we&#39;re taking steps to move forward. I&#39;ve been struggling a bit emotionally, and this feels like movement.  I was pretty into the non-medicalization of birth and and pregnancy before, but I&#39;m over it now. Bring on the blood tests. The trisomy diagnosis has also made me determined to have an NIPT test if and when the time comes (which we did not want to pursue during our last pregnancy). </p>

<p>Let me know if you have any questions or advice! I&#39;ll follow up with results when we have them. </p>

<p>I am so mad at myself and worse yet, DH didn&#39;t want me taking anything so I have no one to complain to. I just want to kick myself in the rear. I was willing to try anything and now my own rashness and stupidity has messed up my cycles. I don&#39;t even know what I&#39;m looking for by writing this. I just wish I could go back in time and slap myself silly. </p>

He's offered
#
* Let it pass naturally, could take up to 5-6 weeks, no way to know of course, could be pretty painful, could have a fair bit of blood loss (I'm anemic so I worry about this, although he said he doesn't think it's an issue)
* Do vaginal misoprostol and expect a miscarriage 12-36 hours later with a follow up ultrasound to check for retained tissue, again, painful, potential for bloodloss
* D&C, get it over with, control blood loss, risk Asherman's

I get next to no time of work, and also **waiting** sounds like a personal hell for control freak me, like.... I can't fathom just now knowing when it's going to happen.

I've also heard the miscarriage with misoprostol can be pretty painful, and having next to no time off work makes that not a great option.

I'm leaning towards D&C, but I know about the risk for scarring/Asherman's.... not insignificant at 25-30%

I don't know, does it make me cold to just want it out and done with so I can move on?  That's how I deal with trauma in general so it's not out of the norm for me.  

No matter how I handle it we can't start trying again until July/August-ish for various logistical reasons, so being able to TTC again quickly isn't necessarily a factor here, I'm mostly considering what will cause the least amount of physical and emotional trauma.

Thoughts?

Had a miscarriage on March 5th at 8 weeks. I honestly didn't experience much pain, just a lot of bleeding. It was enough to warrant hospitalization due to straight up clotting (not tissue).

I was going to wait until my first period to have sex again because I wasn't comfortable with the idea any earlier, but tonight I was feeling confident and ready to go. Hubby was going at it from behind. He ""switched sides"" and I immediately felt pain. By switched, I mean instead of kneeling with his weight on his right knee, he had weight on his left.

I know that in the hospital, they said they saw something on my left side that could be an ectopic pregnancy or a cyst. My HCG is at 0 so I'm assuming it couldn't be an eptopic... right?

Unfortunately, I live in Texas and have been informed I will have to have an ultrasound on Tuesday and the image must be described to me (though I can choose to look away). My husband is not even allowed to be with me during this time. It adds such insult to injury and I am devastated to have one more hurdle to bear before the procedure.

I am exhausted. I don&#39;t know how to keep going but I also don&#39;t know how to quit. </p>

tl;dr context: husband (almost 38) has confirmed high OSA and high normal DFI, as well as borderline MFI. We have continued to get pregnant naturally but miscarry. I had done a full RPL panel, have had two HSGs, an endometrial biopsy, SIS, etc. We do two cycles of IVF with PGS after so many unexplained losses. First cycle -- lots of eggs, lots of high quality embryos -- then only 2 blasts beyond Day 3. Abnormal. Told it's a fluke, do a second cycle -- same amount of eggs, worse fertilization but still all excellent quality embryos until Day 3, then 4 blasts -- again, 75+% abnormals. Took a leap of faith and transferred two mosaics as they were still deemed high quality and our doctor swore by seeing healthy pregnancies despite this. Got pregnant, chemical -- 8 total losses now.

Husband has a confirmed varicocele and is getting an ultrasound in a few weeks to see whether he has more than meets the eye and does in fact need it repaired for any potential success before donor sperm (which two REs had already mentioned after these cycles). I know if he does have surgery recommended, it's still several months until the sperm are ideally better.

In the meantime, the only measure I have not had done is a lap. The only doctor that has mentioned it is Dr. Braverman after my phone consult with him -- but as many in the loss community know, he has his patented 'silent endometriosis' he assumes every woman with unexplained losses has. He said I should do a lap.

My AMH is 2.7, which is normal but low normal for my age, but my LH, FSH, AFC (Often 20+, ER have yielded 16 and 17 eggs respectively), etc. are all fine, my eggs were deemed fine after two ER (though I did have a slightly bigger drop off in mature eggs than expected, though still my total normal of mature eggs put me in 'normal territory,' and the RE wondered if it was a protocol issue since I stim very quickly), we have had one unassisted success at the beginning of all of this, and we do at least have a confirmed issue in all of this unexplained RPL with my husband's OSA/DFI.

Is it worth doing a lap? I have no symptoms of endo, which I know doesn't necessarily mean anything -- but if I continuously get pregnant naturally but lose them, and have had HSGS confirmed my uterus is good, would endo be affecting it? Braverman suggests endo affects egg quality, but then in my research it specifically can affect the shell of the egg affecting fertilization/getting pregnant, which is not our issue.

Would endo in tubes have been noticed at all during egg retrievals at all, too?

I guess I'm asking because there is just nothing else on my end to do, and I guess I'm desperately looking for something to ""get a jump"" on things. But then I looked into laps being more invasive than I thought, as well as some things showing exploratory laps are no longer recommended. And so far, no one who's been all up in my junk has suggested it. I even read that Metformin has been used to treat endo, and that NAC is even more effective than Metformin -- and I've been on that for ages just for its miscarriage reduction effects. So I feel like I've already been treating any hypothetical endo in this method, too? But again, would endo not have been seen between a SIS, two HSGS, two egg retrievals, a million ultrasounds, etc.?

I just need to get this down somewhere. I'm 28, husband is 27, and we've been undergoing infertility treatments for a year - I have stage III/IV endometriosis confirmed by laparoscopy. After 3 failed IUIs, an IVF egg retrieval, OHSS, and a CP with my first FET that was awful, we finally found out we were pregnant last month with a PGS normal girl. We were beyond overjoyed - we told our families, I downloaded a pregnancy app, joined the subreddits I had always wanted to join. A week ago, at six weeks, we had an ultrasound that showed a yolk sac but no fetal pole - but they kept saying it was too early, and not to worry. They told us to come back in a week to see a heartbeat.

So we went back today, at 7 weeks. After 30 minutes of transvaginal ultrasound, the tech looked sadly at me and went to get the doctor. There was a tiny fetal pole - measuring 5w3d, with no heartbeat. The gestational sac measured 5w. I knew then it was over, but we waited 45 minutes in silence for the doctor to come in to confirm it for us. I could feel pure grief at the edge of my mind, pushing against me, trying to get in. I pushed back, held myself together, gripped the chair with my hands. My RE doctor is always smiling - today, he walked in looking devastated. As soon as he walked in the room, all my strength disappeared and I started sobbing. He explained that with no heartbeat and measuring 2 weeks behind with a known transfer date, there is no hope. It was essentially a missed m/c. He's doing a scan for me on Friday to confirm, but explained that it is mostly for closure so that I don't have to wonder in the future. He sat with us for almost 25 minutes, hugged us, and cried with us. 

I really thought this was the one for us. We were so happy, so relieved, so full of hope. Now I am so tired, and so so sad.

First off, I have appreciated this sub so much over the past month or so as I've coped with my miscarriage. Reading about all of your journeys has made me feel much less alone. I had a hysteroscopy today (at the tail end of my first period post-miscarriage 8 weeks ago). The doctor said I had a small amount of retained placenta. She attempted to dislodge it and said she thought she had loosened it enough so that it would come out with my next period. I asked if there was any reason we couldn't try this month, she said no. She was in a rush so I didn't get to follow up about it--my question is, isn't retained placenta a problem? If it's only ""loosened"" and not completely gone, couldn't that cause problems for us conceiving again? And how will I know if it actually comes out during my next period? Will it be obvious?
 The hysteroscopy hurt like a bitch and I have been bleeding like crazy all day, so perhaps it's already come out and is now a non-issue.

Most of you know my story, and it's all in my post history, but I had two miscarriages, a healthy pregnancy resulting in my 2-year-old, and recently another miscarriage.  I am now 10DPO in our first cycle of trying again after finally getting all the tissue removed from my November 2017 positive pregnancy test.  I took a test today because I'm a fucking moron, and of course it's completely negative.  This has sent me into an emotional tailspin more than usual.   

Why do I have three dead babies?  This month is now 9 months we've been trying this time around (including all the time I was pregnant, the MMC, blah blah), and I was ready to have a baby already.  I thought I would be nearing having a baby by this point.  Instead I'm staring at another negative test like a moron because I stupidly thought maybe this would be our month and just couldn't wait for my period to come.  The robotic fertile week sex feels like it kills our relationship--my husband, I know, feels crappy because it seems like I only want to have sex during that week each month.  And you know what?  That's what it feels like to me, too.  It takes so much energy to be constantly wondering what I should be doing differently, what if I might be pregnant, when we should be having sex, if we had sex enough, if something's wrong, if nothing's wrong, etc., etc., etc.  I think he thinks maybe we won't get another one.  I don't know how to keep looking forward and thinking I have to do this for more months to *maybe* get a baby.  More fertile weeks, more two week waits, more symptom spotting, more planning, more energy.  It sounds impossible.  How do I keep up hope?  I'm tired, you guys.  I'm so, so **tired**.    

I know I have a child already.  Shouldn't that be enough?  Shouldn't I just be grateful to have had him?  I mean, I am, I am.  Every day when I see this perfect wonderful little toddler I know how lucky I am.  And I also know how much I desperately want his sibling(s), and then it hurts.  I feel guilty I didn't appreciate *quite enough* being pregnant with him, and having those beautiful newborn days with him.  Then I feel guilty I'm not appreciating *right now* enough because I'm so sad and spent with trying to get another baby.  Every month that ticks by, I'm so aware of the growing time between him and his future sibling.  Today he patted my chest and said ""baby in there?""  I have no idea where he got this, but it was so amazing it almost broke me.  And then I feel guilty that so many who are going through what I am with respect to miscarriages haven't gotten that at all, and then I feel like absolute shit for being sad in the first place.    

On top of all the regular TTC feelings, the terror over repeated loss, and the worry I'll never get the family I've always wanted, my skin is a mess and after the recent miscarriage I've gained a few pounds that just make me feel...off.  Nothing fits me in a way I like, and it's just a concrete reminder of how uncomfortable I feel in my body.  

Thanks for letting me air this.  I'm sorry it's not organized, I'm sorry for being offensive, I'm sorry it's so long.  I don't know anyone to talk to about this.  I'm just so mad, and so sad.  I feel completely hopeless.  Will I ever get the living babies I want?  It feels like maybe not, and it's terrible.

Today he patted my chest and said &quot;baby in there?&quot;  I have no idea where he got this, but it was so amazing it almost broke me.  And then I feel guilty that so many who are going through what I am with respect to miscarriages haven&#39;t gotten that at all, and then I feel like absolute shit for being sad in the first place.    </p>

<p>On top of all the regular TTC feelings, the terror over repeated loss, and the worry I&#39;ll never get the family I&#39;ve always wanted, my skin is a mess and after the recent miscarriage I&#39;ve gained a few pounds that just make me feel...off.  Nothing fits me in a way I like, and it&#39;s just a concrete reminder of how uncomfortable I feel in my body.  </p>

<p>Thanks for letting me air this.  I&#39;m sorry it&#39;s not organized, I&#39;m sorry for being offensive, I&#39;m sorry it&#39;s so long.  I don&#39;t know anyone to talk to about this.  I&#39;m just so mad, and so sad.  I feel completely hopeless.  Will I ever get the living babies I want?  It feels like maybe not, and it&#39;s terrible.</p>

So I just had my second miscarriage in a row two weeks ago. I'm feeling so heartbroken and alone. Really, I just need ""someone"" to tell all this to who will understand.

TW: I have two LC. My first dd was conceived pretty easily after four months of trying. Uneventful pregnancy. I needed to go to an RE for my second as my prolactin stayed elevated after breastfeeding and was causing me to have a short luteal phase. Also discovered to be slightly hypothyroid. Was put on meds to manage both and conceived my second dd the next cycle. Another uneventful pregnancy.

Last summer we were ready for #3 so I just had my OB prescribe me bromocriptine for my prolactin. My thyroid had been well managed since being diagnosed. Prolactin went down and we conceived the next cycle. That pregnancy was uneventful until 16 weeks. I had had the genetic testing done at 12 weeks because I was 37 and all came back normal. 12 week visit baby had a heartbeat. At 16 weeks I woke up spotting one morning. Went to get checked and there was no heartbeat. Baby only measured 12 weeks 3 days. I ended up passing everything naturally at home that evening. Devastating and traumatic to say the least. We weren't able to get any answers since I passed the baby at home and we weren't offered any testing. Despite being super sad I was able to reason that it was just a random fluke, these things happen, and there must have been some issue that we just couldn't test for.

After that I immediately went back to my RE bc I was at a new OB anyway and knew they wouldn't want to manage my hormone issues. Got back on bromocriptine and meanwhile did a saline ultrasound. Saw that I had a small polyp so had that removed in January. Was supposed to wait a cycle but I just knew I needed to try. Got pregnant in January with twins. I was so, so excited. I felt like it was just meant to be. I had a bleeding episode early on at like 6 weeks. My RE was already doing weekly ultrasounds and she saw a small area of bleeding in my uterus. She wasn't concerned and it wasn't near the babies. Continued to have instances of bleeding and got checked every time. Babies were growing and had heartbeats. Doctor just said sometimes it happens, it may resolve or may stick around the whole pregnancy. At 8 weeks 5 days I had another gush of blood. Went to get check and babies were great but the area of bleeding had grown. Doctor still wasn't concerned. That night I passed a ton of clots and saw one of the babies. Confirmed the next day that both had indeed passed. I am beyond crushed. They were fine that afternoon. Growth on track and healthy heartbeats. And then just literally ripped from inside me. Interestingly I developed a fever that same day and my doctor put me on antibiotics just in case. Although my white cell count was normal. The fever stuck around for a week until I passed a final, large clot/tissue. My doctor doesn't really have an answer for this one either. Probably related to the bleed getting larger but who knows. Not able to do testing on this one either. I blame myself because I didn't wait a month after the polyp removal so my uterus must not have been healed yet. I thought the polyp was so small it couldn't make a difference.

Anyway, thank you for reading this wall of text. I just turned 38 ( day before this latest mc - thanks universe) so I feel like the clock is ticking. My family is not complete and my heart is ripped to shreds. Half the time I reason that these two miscarriages don't seem to be related and were unfortunate events. The other half I go down a rabbit hole of convincing myself my body is failing and I've got some sort of issue that is causing my body to reject my babies.

I know its the hormone dump but I'm just feeling so hopeless this week. I miss the three babies I will now never know. I'll never know what they look like or hear their little voices. My husband has been great and taking care of our girls a lot while I recover. But he can just never understand the pain of losing the babies growing inside you.

My RE is following my hcg down and I'll go back on the bromocriptine and she'll do another saline ultrasound to make sure everything is gone. Then we'll try again. This waiting game is brutal. I just want to be pregnant again. Not looking like we will have a baby in 2018 now.

Anyway, thanks again for reading. I know the ladies here understand. I'm having a much harder time this go round. How do you get out of your own head? Even the daily basics are so hard right now.
