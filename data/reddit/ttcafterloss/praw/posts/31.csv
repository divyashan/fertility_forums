I have posted here once before but will introduce myself again.  I found out about a month ago, when I would have been 8 weeks, that I had a blighted ovum.  I wanted to wait for it to pass naturally, but my body just wouldn't recognize that anything was wrong, so last week I confirmed it with a second ultrasound and had a D & C at what would have been 12 weeks--a few days after my 30th birthday.  This would have been my first child, and my husband and I are very eager to start our family.

Although everyone in my life has been incredibly supportive, I am having a tough time coping.  I have always been introverted, but have a wonderful family.  My parents and in-laws both live about 1/2 hour away, and we have always enjoyed and placed a high priority on spending time with them, even though all the social stimulation can be exhausting for me.  I have really not wanted to see anyone but my husband outside of work since the miscarriage, and although we have seen our families several times, I have also canceled plans and turned down invitations several times due to not feeling up to it.  I know it's important to be gentle with myself, and everyone has been very understanding.

Along similar lines, I have always had trouble controlling my eating, and I have been very indulgent in that regard as I go through this difficult time.

I am torn because part of me wants to do everything I can to make this time easier and less horrible for myself.  But I am a person who can very easily fall into bad habits.  I can imagine it being much harder to go back to combating my introversion and overeating in the future if I don't start being stricter with myself now.  

I was wondering if anyone here has had experiences on either side of this conundrum--either forming bad habits while grieving and then fighting them later, or trying to stay strong while grieving to make things easier later on.  How did it go for you?  Do you have any advice for me?  I would really appreciate any help.

<p>I have posted here once before but will introduce myself again.  I found out about a month ago, when I would have been 8 weeks, that I had a blighted ovum.  I wanted to wait for it to pass naturally, but my body just wouldn&#39;t recognize that anything was wrong, so last week I confirmed it with a second ultrasound and had a D &amp; C at what would have been 12 weeks--a few days after my 30th birthday.  This would have been my first child, and my husband and I are very eager to start our family.</p>

26,2048,confidence,<praw.reddit.Reddit object at 0x7f12a630cd90>,,ttcafterloss,"So my fiance just introduced me to reddit, telling me that I may be able to find some comfort in talking to other women who have been through the same thing. I've been reading the posts on here.  It's crazy how many stories are exactly the same as mine. 

So I found out I was pregnant on February 20th of this year. I went to the hospital because my blood sugars had been running really low for about 2 weeks (type 1 diabetic). Anyway, they did the regular urinalysis & come to find out, I was pregnant. The hospital I was at didn't have a woman's center & since I was automatically considered ""high risk"" because of my diabetes, they wanted to transport me to a woman's center immediately. I was just about to leave the hospital but I had to pee for the 50th time since I had gotten there. I was spotting. I called the nurse in top show her & she said I had nothing to worry about. 

They sent me to the woman center & by the time I got there, the pain started coming. I was getting really light headed & was bleeding significantly more. I told the ER nurses that I was pregnant & that something was wrong & they showed no sense of urgency. Now, after 6 hours of waiting in the waiting room, covered in blood nearly screaming in pain, a nurse finally comes out. She tells me she's just drawing blood so we can get results. I told her that I was covered in blood & how much immense pain I was in. Again, no sense of urgency. I sat there for another 4 hours. 
(This is kind of graphic, I apologize.) At that time, I had already had the miscarriage. I body had already discarded the baby. My baby. I was no longer pregnant. 

By then, I knew what had happened  (I went through this back in 2013). I just wanted to go home. But no, they proceeded to take me back (after nearly 12 hours of sitting in the waiting room) for testing. They did every test imaginable. 

The worst part about it had to have been when they took me back for an ultrasound. The part most mothers look forward to, I was dreading the most. I knew there would be nothing to see at this point & was just going to get my worst nightmares confirmed again & again. The doctors gave me an estimate on how far along I might have been based on my hcg which at the time was 2200. They said I was anywhere between 10 & 12 weeks. 

It all happened so slow, yet so fast. I wish the time after I found out & the time before I lost her (I believe it was a girl. My little princess.) was at least long enough so I could have seen her. Just once. Heard her heartbeat. Got a estimated date of delivery. Anything. 

It's been 8 months now & I still carry my pregnancy test around in my pocket every single day. It's my motivation. If I don't have ""her"" with me I feel lost. The pain seems like it gets worse, never better. My body can't take it, let alone my mind. My body is always convinced I'm pregnant, even if I know I'm not. That's the worst part. I want a baby so bad. I always have. But at the same time I never want to experience this again. Not a 3rd time. I cant.

I&#39;ve been reading the posts on here.  It&#39;s crazy how many stories are exactly the same as mine. </p>

<p>So I found out I was pregnant on February 20th of this year. I went to the hospital because my blood sugars had been running really low for about 2 weeks (type 1 diabetic). Anyway, they did the regular urinalysis &amp; come to find out, I was pregnant. The hospital I was at didn&#39;t have a woman&#39;s center &amp; since I was automatically considered &quot;high risk&quot; because of my diabetes, they wanted to transport me to a woman&#39;s center immediately. I was just about to leave the hospital but I had to pee for the 50th time since I had gotten there. I was spotting. I called the nurse in top show her &amp; she said I had nothing to worry about. </p>

<p>They sent me to the woman center &amp; by the time I got there, the pain started coming. I was getting really light headed &amp; was bleeding significantly more. I told the ER nurses that I was pregnant &amp; that something was wrong &amp; they showed no sense of urgency. Now, after 6 hours of waiting in the waiting room, covered in blood nearly screaming in pain, a nurse finally comes out. She tells me she&#39;s just drawing blood so we can get results. I told her that I was covered in blood &amp; how much immense pain I was in. Again, no sense of urgency. I sat there for another 4 hours. 
(This is kind of graphic, I apologize.) At that time, I had already had the miscarriage. I body had already discarded the baby. My baby. I was no longer pregnant. </p>

<p>By then, I knew what had happened  (I went through this back in 2013). I just wanted to go home. But no, they proceeded to take me back (after nearly 12 hours of sitting in the waiting room) for testing. They did every test imaginable. </p>

<p>The worst part about it had to have been when they took me back for an ultrasound. The part most mothers look forward to, I was dreading the most. I knew there would be nothing to see at this point &amp; was just going to get my worst nightmares confirmed again &amp; again. The doctors gave me an estimate on how far along I might have been based on my hcg which at the time was 2200. They said I was anywhere between 10 &amp; 12 weeks. </p>

<p>It all happened so slow, yet so fast. I wish the time after I found out &amp; the time before I lost her (I believe it was a girl. My little princess.) was at least long enough so I could have seen her. Just once. Heard her heartbeat. Got a estimated date of delivery. Anything. </p>

<p>It&#39;s been 8 months now &amp; I still carry my pregnancy test around in my pocket every single day. It&#39;s my motivation. If I don&#39;t have &quot;her&quot; with me I feel lost. The pain seems like it gets worse, never better. My body can&#39;t take it, let alone my mind. My body is always convinced I&#39;m pregnant, even if I know I&#39;m not. That&#39;s the worst part. I want a baby so bad. I always have. But at the same time I never want to experience this again. Not a 3rd time. I cant. </p>

<p>I just don&#39;t know what to do. So now I&#39;m seeking help, advice, stories. I need insight. Please. I need some relief. I can&#39;t do this anymore.</p>

- **[Just One of the Guys - Jenny Lewis](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Irvcf6dCk-k)** for obvious reasons
- **[Reaper - Sia] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XeM0lzQhigg)** for when the depression/anxiety has just about taken you but you're not ready to give up
- **[Local Girl - Neko Case](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpLx0qw3TsM)** - I have no obvious reason as to why I love this song so much. It helped me when my best friend told me she was pregnant 5 days after my loss and on my birthday. Drama ensued, obviously. I love everything by Neko Case, especially from her album Fox Confessor Brings the Flood
- Bonus song:  **[Jenny Lewis - Happy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crUK6jSQSw8)** from her album Rabbit Fur Coat, which is so hauntingly dark it's beautiful. This song is about being a control freak

I have PCOS and, as a consequence, I have long(ish) irregular cycles which (up until this point) are ovulatory, albeit late (CD22-25). I've had two early MCs this year, and I'm just getting further and further away from my goal and here's why:

In March I got my BFP. A nice DARK DEFINITE one. Then in late April I lost it. In June, I conceived again. Never got quite the line I saw for my first positive test, but I was definitely pregnant. Lost that one in July, but was put on progesterone during my luteal phase for future pregnancies to prevent loss. We got pregnant the first two times immediately. Then I had a two ovulatory cycles immediately after which were ""normal"" where I started progesterone at 3 DPO. No pregnancy with either of those cycles. I get it, it's about chance, and I get it that we were lucky to get pregnant the first two times. I can live with trying unsuccessfully for awhile knowing that I have the progesterone now.

But now here I am, and my temps are all over the place. Usually I get textbook ovulatory BBT charts. I started to get darkening lines on OPKs two days ago, but none were true positives and they've since faded. It's CD23 and I have no EWCM and no ovulation cramps like I usually get. Absolutely no clue what my body is doing. So I've gone from pregnant, to less pregnant, to just plain ovulatory cycles, to now what I think is going to be an anovulatory cycle. I'm going backwards and I just want to cry. I'm not overweight, I take my vitamins, I'm not sedentary, and (other than this TTC crap) I don't have a lot of major stresses in life. I just don't freaking get it. Thanks for reading, folks.

E.g, my husband and I started TTC#2 in January and got pregnant in May on cycle 4, but then we started over in September after my MC in July. So, technically, this is cycle #2 post-MC, but if we are thinking about how LONG it's been that we've been trying to Have A Baby, it's been, like, ten months.

""Alright, here goes. I'm old. What that means is that I've survived (so far) and a lot of people I've known and loved did not. I've lost friends, best friends, acquaintances, co-workers, grandparents, mom, relatives, teachers, mentors, students, neighbors, and a host of other folks. I have no children, and I can't imagine the pain it must be to lose a child. But here's my two cents.

I wish I could say you get used to people dying. I never did. I don't want to. It tears a hole through me whenever somebody I love dies, no matter the circumstances. But I don't want it to ""not matter"". I don't want it to be something that just passes. My scars are a testament to the love and the relationship that I had for and with that person. And if the scar is deep, so was the love. So be it. Scars are a testament to life. Scars are a testament that I can love deeply and live deeply and be cut, or even gouged, and that I can heal and continue to live and continue to love. And the scar tissue is stronger than the original flesh ever was. Scars are a testament to life. Scars are only ugly to people who can't see.

As for grief, you'll find it comes in waves. When the ship is first wrecked, you're drowning, with wreckage all around you. Everything floating around you reminds you of the beauty and the magnificence of the ship that was, and is no more. And all you can do is float. You find some piece of the wreckage and you hang on for a while. Maybe it's some physical thing. Maybe it's a happy memory or a photograph. Maybe it's a person who is also floating. For a while, all you can do is float. Stay alive.

In the beginning, the waves are 100 feet tall and crash over you without mercy. They come 10 seconds apart and don't even give you time to catch your breath. All you can do is hang on and float. After a while, maybe weeks, maybe months, you'll find the waves are still 100 feet tall, but they come further apart. When they come, they still crash all over you and wipe you out. But in between, you can breathe, you can function. You never know what's going to trigger the grief. It might be a song, a picture, a street intersection, the smell of a cup of coffee. It can be just about anything...and the wave comes crashing. But in between waves, there is life.

Somewhere down the line, and it's different for everybody, you find that the waves are only 80 feet tall. Or 50 feet tall. And while they still come, they come further apart. You can see them coming. An anniversary, a birthday, or Christmas, or landing at O'Hare. You can see it coming, for the most part, and prepare yourself. And when it washes over you, you know that somehow you will, again, come out the other side. Soaking wet, sputtering, still hanging on to some tiny piece of the wreckage, but you'll come out. Take it from an old guy. The waves never stop coming, and somehow you don't really want them to. But you learn that you'll survive them. And other waves will come. And you'll survive them too. If you're lucky, you'll have lots of scars from lots of loves.

*****

Today is National Pregnancy and Infant Loss Awareness Day. I posted a few weeks ago, but it was restricted to my friends, so now I'm making my public post to help spread awareness about what is so often taboo and suffered in silence.

Some of you know that I adore the nunber 3. It's my fave number, as dorky as that sounds. I have some residual OCD, and 3 often plays into that. Imagine my joy at finding put I was pregnant on September 3rd in my 3rd cycle of trying. It was the day before my wedding anniversary and I'd intended to test on them but got impatient.

If you've never been pregnant, I can't truly describe the joy and terror that comes with seeing those 2 pink lines, no matter how faint. I took a ridiculous number of home pregnancy tests over the next week and told my family, my close friends, and some of you FB lovelies. I woke up every morning smiling so hard because I was pregnant.

All the while, however, I was panicking to myself. I was obsessing over the possibility of losing the baby. You see, I've literally always felt like I wasn't going to keep my first baby. I can't explain it, it's just a bone deep knowledge I have felt for YEARS. It didn't help that my due date was in May and May is my cursed month. So much sadness happens then so it naturally ramped up my anxiety. I tried to ignore the apprehension and as the weeks crawled by, my chances for a miscarriage lowered and I let myself hope.

Then came the spotting. It was light at first, but I sobbed hysterically. I knew it was the beginning of the end. Everyone told me I was overreacting and that it was normal. So many anecdotes about how it happened to people and they had healthy pregnancies. I knew I wouldn't be one of them.

3 days after the spotting, I took a Clear Blue Digital with Weeks Estimator and it didn't say I was as far as I should be. Again, everyone told me they're not accurate or maybe I was slow tonprogress, but I knew. It hurt that almost no one seemed to take my fears seriously. Then came more spotting and cramping so I went to the doctor. He said the same things others had, did an exam, and drew blood. He said as of right then, it looked like I hadn't started miscarrying. I let myself feel hope and relief. Then the cramping got worse and not even my husband could deny things.

On a Friday morning on what should have been my 6th week of pregnancy and almost 3 weeks after that first positive test, I miscarried at home. The feeling of knowing what was happening was indescribable. I'd been right all along and I was now a member of a club no one should have to join.

I posted on FB and got a crazy amount of support and love. Truly, I couldn't ask for more supportive friends. A heartbreaking number of you have been in this position and you're all amazing <3 

I hope by sharing my story, it helps someone else because this has been such a lobely road. It doesn't matter how many others have suffered this, you still feel alone in your grief, esp when it's an early loss. Some people seem to think it's easy to move on after an early loss, but it's agony sometimes. It's getting easier though.

To everyone who has lost their baby, I'm so sorry. To everyone who hasnt, I'd never wish this pain on my worst enemy.

83,2048,confidence,<praw.reddit.Reddit object at 0x7f12a630cd90>,,ttcafterloss,"This is what I posted this morning (replaced husband's name w/ SO):


Today's date, October 15th, holds a very new meaning for me this year.  It is National Pregnancy and Infant Loss Awareness Day, and although I rarely share anything personal on Facebook, I have decided that it's the perfect time to tell you all my story.

Today, after 3 years of battling infertility, I should have been 12 weeks pregnant.  I was supposed to be planning a cutesy announcement to tell you all that SO and I were happily expecting a baby in April.  But sadly, 12 very painful days ago, I found out that I had miscarried and that this journey would only be getting more difficult.

Some of you may already know this, but SO and I have been trying to conceive for nearly 3 years.  In 2013 we built our house with plenty of space for a family, and were SO excited to start trying once we got settled in.  It never really occurred to us that it would take more than a couple of months. 

About 8 months after we started trying, I was diagnosed with Polycystic Ovarian Syndrome, which makes it nearly impossible for me to ovulate.  I started taking some medicine that was supposed to help, and we continued on.  Several months and a few invasive tests later I was put on a fertility drug called Clomid, which gave me plenty of horrible side effects (intense hot-flashes, anyone?) but after 5 miserable cycles, I was still not pregnant.  Last August, we finally decided to consult with a fertility specialist, who told us that we would likely never conceive without In-Vitro Fertilization (IVF).  We were devastated at the expense, but at least we knew that we had a plan.  I was scared to go through all of the tests, the hormones, the daily injections, and the constant stream of doctors appointments, but we knew that it would all be worth it in the end.  In February of this year I underwent a painful egg-retrieval procedure so that we could start the IVF process, and in May we transferred 2 frozen embryos.  We were convinced that it would work...but it didn't.  It was hard knowing that even this level of medical intervention could fail, but saw it as a sort of trial run for next time. We took a bit of time off this summer, but I started again with the injections, hormones, etc. in preparation for our 2nd frozen embryo transfer this past August.  We just KNEW that our 2nd round would work, and I even did extra things such as acupuncture to boost my chances.  At the end of August, we were elated to find out that the transfer had worked, and we were officially 4 weeks pregnant!  After the crappy journey that had taken us here, we both knew we needed to be cautiously optimistic, but the fears died down after we heard a healthy heartbeat, and we began to really dream of the future for this child.  I started thinking about a registry, was excitedly looking up nursery decor, and we even put a deposit down on a daycare.  Everything was finally on track!  

The morning of October 3rd, at a routine ultrasound, four words changed my world forever.  ""There is no heartbeat.""  Four words, and everything SO and I had dreamed of, everything we had gone through these past months, was all for nothing. At ten weeks, our baby had died. Sitting there in the doctors office, listening to options, and walking out into a waiting room full of blissfully pregnant women was probably the hardest thing I've ever had to go through.  I had a surgical procedure the next morning, and just like that, I was no longer pregnant.

I wanted to share this story with you all, not for pity or prayers, but so that you hold your babies a little closer tonight and think about what this horrible day represents.  I want this story to make you thankful for the sleepless nights up with your kids, for the dirty diapers and the cancelled plans.  Because there are people out there who would do anything to stay up late holding a crying baby, instead of staying up all night crying for the baby they will never get to hold.

I wanted to share this story so that you would think twice when you ask someone why they haven't had kids yet, or ask when they plan to start trying.  It hurts when you ache to be a mother with your entire being and some stranger won't stop pestering you about your biological clock, or tells you how selfish it is to be childless.  I want you to realize that a mother of a toddler may desperately WANT to give her child a sibling but simply cannot (secondary infertility exists too).  I want you to realize that it's not always that easy.  Trying to make a baby is not always fun.  No amount of ""just relaxing"" will give an infertile woman a child when even miraculous medical intervention has failed.  Even the most innocent questions can cause a tremendous amount of pain for someone struggling with losses or infertility.

Statistically, 1 in 4 pregnancies will end in a loss.  For some reason, people tend to sweep these losses under the rug, hide their pain and their stories as if they were in some way taboo.  But I want to break the silence and start a conversation.  1 in 8 women in the US suffer from infertility, and yet most of us never speak out about our condition, afraid that our stories might be viewed as shameful. Afraid of being perceived as flawed. But I personally believe that suffering in silence is unnecessary, and feel that the support I've gotten during my struggle has been priceless. 

I know that our loss happened relatively early, and I'm sure it cannot compare in pain to stillbirth, infant death, or even later-term losses. But this baby was real to us, and so very loved and wanted. This journey has taught us both a great deal about ourselves, about our marriage, and about our respective internal strengths. SO has been an amazing support system throughout all of this, learning to give me shots, and helping me cope with the physical and emotional side effects of the process. His dedication and empathy have made me hope, more than ever, that he will finally get to become a father someday soon.

We will do another round of IVF in a while and hopefully it will all work out in the end...but I will always remember this pregnancy, and the baby that we never got to meet.  I know that SO and I are young and healthy and that statistics are generally in our favor. But the journey sucks, and it's painful and overwhelming and outrageously expensive. I'm just hoping that sharing this will make things a little bit better...for myself, and for all the other couples out there struggling with this painful reality and the heartache it brings.

We took a bit of time off this summer, but I started again with the injections, hormones, etc. in preparation for our 2nd frozen embryo transfer this past August.  We just KNEW that our 2nd round would work, and I even did extra things such as acupuncture to boost my chances.  At the end of August, we were elated to find out that the transfer had worked, and we were officially 4 weeks pregnant!  After the crappy journey that had taken us here, we both knew we needed to be cautiously optimistic, but the fears died down after we heard a healthy heartbeat, and we began to really dream of the future for this child.  I started thinking about a registry, was excitedly looking up nursery decor, and we even put a deposit down on a daycare.  Everything was finally on track!  </p>

<p>The morning of October 3rd, at a routine ultrasound, four words changed my world forever.  &quot;There is no heartbeat.&quot;  Four words, and everything SO and I had dreamed of, everything we had gone through these past months, was all for nothing. At ten weeks, our baby had died. Sitting there in the doctors office, listening to options, and walking out into a waiting room full of blissfully pregnant women was probably the hardest thing I&#39;ve ever had to go through.  I had a surgical procedure the next morning, and just like that, I was no longer pregnant.</p>

<p>I wanted to share this story with you all, not for pity or prayers, but so that you hold your babies a little closer tonight and think about what this horrible day represents.  I want this story to make you thankful for the sleepless nights up with your kids, for the dirty diapers and the cancelled plans.  Because there are people out there who would do anything to stay up late holding a crying baby, instead of staying up all night crying for the baby they will never get to hold.</p>

<p>I wanted to share this story so that you would think twice when you ask someone why they haven&#39;t had kids yet, or ask when they plan to start trying.  It hurts when you ache to be a mother with your entire being and some stranger won&#39;t stop pestering you about your biological clock, or tells you how selfish it is to be childless.  I want you to realize that a mother of a toddler may desperately WANT to give her child a sibling but simply cannot (secondary infertility exists too).  I want you to realize that it&#39;s not always that easy.  Trying to make a baby is not always fun.  No amount of &quot;just relaxing&quot; will give an infertile woman a child when even miraculous medical intervention has failed.  Even the most innocent questions can cause a tremendous amount of pain for someone struggling with losses or infertility.</p>

<p>Statistically, 1 in 4 pregnancies will end in a loss.  For some reason, people tend to sweep these losses under the rug, hide their pain and their stories as if they were in some way taboo.  But I want to break the silence and start a conversation.  1 in 8 women in the US suffer from infertility, and yet most of us never speak out about our condition, afraid that our stories might be viewed as shameful. Afraid of being perceived as flawed. But I personally believe that suffering in silence is unnecessary, and feel that the support I&#39;ve gotten during my struggle has been priceless. </p>

<p>I know that our loss happened relatively early, and I&#39;m sure it cannot compare in pain to stillbirth, infant death, or even later-term losses. But this baby was real to us, and so very loved and wanted. This journey has taught us both a great deal about ourselves, about our marriage, and about our respective internal strengths. SO has been an amazing support system throughout all of this, learning to give me shots, and helping me cope with the physical and emotional side effects of the process. His dedication and empathy have made me hope, more than ever, that he will finally get to become a father someday soon.</p>

<p>We will do another round of IVF in a while and hopefully it will all work out in the end...but I will always remember this pregnancy, and the baby that we never got to meet.  I know that SO and I are young and healthy and that statistics are generally in our favor. But the journey sucks, and it&#39;s painful and overwhelming and outrageously expensive. I&#39;m just hoping that sharing this will make things a little bit better...for myself, and for all the other couples out there struggling with this painful reality and the heartache it brings.</p>

""October is Miscarriage and Baby Loss Awareness Month.

I’ve been relatively open about my experience, but I think we have a long way to go to normalize the conversation and remove the stigma of discussing pregnancy loss (made evident by the fact that I not only removed more than a dozen people but also edited this 15 times before posting).

I know that some people choose to remain silent not out of shame. There are so many others who could use an outlet outside of anonymous internet forums, but feel uncomfortable or ashamed to talk about it because it’s still taboo even though it’s so common; so common that more than 20% of pregnancies end in miscarriage, and factors like lifestyle, diet, quality of genes (see: Beyonce), and stress don’t have a thing to do with it despite what some people assume.

I happen to be totally comfortable talking about my experience, especially if doing so may provide support and let someone know, in the midst of this sad, isolating, and confusing experience, you are not alone. Your story might make people sad, uncomfortable, or tongue-tied, but if it’s aching to be told, share it.

I’m sharing this today because not only is October miscarriage awareness month, earlier this year we lost a baby that would have been due today, October 13th. I have shared with very few people that we have also lost 2 pregnancies since then. Yep, I am now a card-carrying member of the recurrent pregnancy loss club, and it doesn’t come with any exciting benefits if you can believe it.

I’ve learned this year that a lot of people don’t know how to respond after hearing about a loss of this nature. (Side note: I was lucky to receive a lot of loving support, but I have experienced the ugly too). It’s a confusing situation that everyone treats and views differently. No one knows the exact right thing to say and a lot of the time, well-meaning people say hurtful things in an effort to provide an explanation or hope.

Others dismiss it, perhaps thinking they are doing you a favor by not reminding you. But I know you’re likely being reminded of it 100 times a day and maybe all you really could use is someone offering their ear so you can honor your baby’s memory, talk about the magnitude of your loss, and your pain and anger over it; or vent about having to go to your follow-up doctor’s appointments and sit in a waiting room full of huge baby bellies while trying not to fall apart, wondering if they’ve ever been as unlucky as you.

Through the past several months, a rollercoaster of loss, grief, rinse, repeat, (among loads of other happy events for which I am thankful) I started compiling ideas from my own experiences and turned them into hand-painted cards. Mostly it was a way to aid in my own personal healing and fill my time with something healthy to distract from the fact that I’m not preparing a nursery or shopping for cute onesies like I imagined I would be right now. I am also hoping to provide other women like me with appropriate support and empathy.

A year later I'm in a completely different place (as we all are if we are here). I want to post something on social media but I don't know what. My losses were not far enough along to make me feel like I should post to honor a lost child, but I want to honor *something*. I want to honor this journey, all of you that are and have been on this miserable and heartbreaking journey with me, and all of those who suffer in silence. I want those who don't get it to get it. Is that even possible? I'm not on Facebook anymore and haven't been since December. Part of me wishes I was simply so I could post something. But I do have Instagram and am contemplating a post for Saturday, but what? I almost never post personal things - and if I do they are funny.

My god mother saw the Facebook thing and messaged my mother saying she thinks I'm a good mother but I'm lost. Now in the past I've made posts about being pro choice. I personally could never terminate a pregnancy My mother told her that I had miscarried three times and that two of those were this year the first in April and the second in July. I've known this woman all of my life and I had hoped that she knew me and my mother better than that.

These have been incredibly hard. My due date is coming up for the first one and I'm really struggling right now. I should be pregnant getting ready for our new child.

Can you sum up how finding out and going through this has left you in regards to family and friends?

Amanda has felt alienated from a lot of people including her own mum and siblings and she feels the only time anyone talks to her is when she blogs about it.

Everyone always says ""we just want to give you space"" and ""I thought that people in this situation would prefer to be alone"".

I just want to get a summary of peoples experience regarding this and if possible, a message of how you actually wanted to be treated or interacted with.

On a side note, I am going to be doing a leg wax for charity. You could knit a sweater out of my leg hair and I would like to raise some money for the Sands charity and the SiMBA charity who have been amazing to us. Has anyone here ever done anything like this before? I wouldn't know where to begin with starting this. A gofundme perhaps?

My periods haven't been regular since my loss 5 months ago, so I'm not sure how accurate the fertile time in my tracker (ovia) is. My latest period came 10 days early! 

My issue is I can't decide between trackers. The clear blue ones seem the easiest, especially if I need to test in the afternoon at work (which seems yo be the recommended time based on what I've read). But the wondfo and others seem more cost efficient if I need to track for a while, but harder to do when I'm not at home. (By harder, I mean messier and less inconspicuous.)
