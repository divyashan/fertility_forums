Been TTC for a year this month. About 2 weeks ago I had been feeling beyond tired (naps + 8 hours at night, I have horrible sleeping issues so that was way out of my norm) along with consistent low nausea. I had just had my 'period' so it was weird that I wasn't feeling better. It had been a long one with terrible cramps, but I tested along with my OPK on a whim. It was positive (my first ever) but the lines were way too light for how far past O I was (nevermind the bleeding) so I knew right away that it was a CP. Fortunately, I had an appointment with my Dr already scheduled and we confirmed with a couple blood tests that it was a very early MC. 

Emotionality I feel pretty okay, just empty I guess? The usual feeling of being broken somehow which isn't new a year in, and disinterest in doing anything (at this point showing is an effort). I've dealt with depression forever so I know I'm just on a bit of a low swing, but why am I not sad? I feel like I should be more emotional about it or cry but I just had a gut feeling from the beginning that we would have at least one MC. Not sure why, I just knew. My SO has been sweet but it was back to normal for him right away, I guess I'm just not ready to move on yet. Really I just want to sleep and feel normal again, or have a good cry and binge ice cream and grieve. I'm stuck in limbo.

On a better note, I finally told my Mom that we were TTC and that I had a CP. She's pretty religious so I was worried that she would have issue with the fact we aren't married or go all mom on me about us not being ready in her mind. The talk went so much better then I could have hoped, she was wonderful and supportive but didn't give me that crap about God having a plan etc etc. I'm so glad I told her, I feel like it changed how she saw me a bit, more as an adult then her kid.

Did it take anyone some time to get their libido back? I haven't liked being touched at all (at least by humans, animal cuddles are great) since I found out I was having a CP. I want to start trying again once I get the all clear, but sex just sounds terrible. I'm usually pretty HL, so this is weird. My poor SO has been wonderful and patient, but will make the occasional offhanded comment about being frisky that is meant as a compliment but makes me just feel so guilty (that translates as him being kinda gross, but he really isn't pushy or expecting anything - I think he just misses the intimacy).

We were told it would take about six weeks until my period returned, and that was fine with me.  About two to three weeks after my miscarriage, I had some spotting and cramping to the point that I was worried about retained tissue, but after a particularly bad cramp, some tissue did come out and I didn't spot again.  I had EWCM a few days later, so I knew we were back in action.  It also meant that my period was probably inevitable.

Last week, I became a pimply mess, which is normal.  My poor dry hair desperately needed conditioner at the tips, but was so greasy at the roots.  All normal for PMS.  Then, the mood swings hit.  That's normal for me, but not to this extent.  PHEW!  I feel bad for my students who had to deal with constant emotional whiplash from me.

I genuinely didn't understand the PTS/PTSD that some women face after miscarriage until I started seeing the blood.  It was so hard to see and have to deal with.  My first two days are always heavy, but manageable with a super or ultra tampon.  This morning, I was racing to the restroom way too frequently to change super tampons, and I knew work was a bad idea, since I can't always get to a restroom. 

The period today is almost as bad as the day of my miscarriage.  Seeing blood everywhere when I try to shower, having to wipe down the seat after using the restroom, and going through so much toilet paper to try and get clean is so similar to my miscarriage and so different from my normal periods.

It got worse when I passed a clot on the toilet.  I used to pass small, relatively unnoticeable clots during my period.  Feeling them pass during my miscarriage was a new sensation, and it was hard to have it again today over and over.  The cramping is also awful beyond belief.  It's just constant and terrible.

Oh, and worse?  Having to call my boss, who is already stressed with finding subs, and trying to explain why I had to be out again without giving so much detail that I gross her out, and giving enough detail that she knows I have a plausible reason.

And yet, here I am with no baby, feeling like a failure and just.... done. I want to stop to save us the emotional roller coaster month after month, but I know we can’t or it’ll never happen. 

A week before thanksgiving, I had a CP. It absolutely devastated me. Thanksgiving was really rough, and something happened that I can’t stop thinking about. 
A relative and his husband have been openly trying for a baby via surrogate, and there was a lot of talk about babies and conceiving and the process of testing etc. Nobody knows we’ve been trying, and nobody knows about our loss. Then, they nonchalantly mentioned that their last try was unsuccessful, and said:
“The egg implanted but it didn’t take, so she never ACTUALLY got pregnant”.

It was said so casual, so offhand, but hearing it broke my heart even though they had no idea what we were going through that week. I think about that a lot and it makes me feel invalidated somehow - like I was never “ACTUALLY pregnant” either, because it was so early. I feel foolish for being so devastated when they were able to discuss a similar experience so casually. For being so broken hearted over the loss of what I consider to be my baby’s life, when others can just chalk a similar experience up to not even being pregnant at all. Because they were explaining the process of conceiving to the rest of the family, it was like they were telling everyone that this happening is no big deal/not even counting as being pregnant. I‘m afraid if I ever do tell anyone about our loss they’ll think that I’m overreacting in comparison - or like our loss doesn’t actually constitute a loss at all. 

I know that for two men TTC it’s probably a different experience than having it happen inside your own body, I can’t pretend to know. But this whole thing makes me feel so... wounded but stupid at the same time. 

Sorry for the ramble, I figure if anyone can understand how I feel it’s you guys.
The silver lining (if you can call it that) is I have my appointment with my OB this month to figure out what testing needs to be done and to discuss options for infertility treatments, which is at least a step forward.

Quick recap: we were unicorns, but right before Christmas at 13+6 I had a MMC. I've also had the unfortunate distinction of my body taking a particularly long time to recover. 11 weeks later we are still tracking my HCG to zero.

This week my brother let me know he was coming into town, and we planned a summit hike with our younger brother and my husband.

We get to the top and my brother tells me: he's going to be a dad. He's known since December but didn't want to upset me. This is an unplanned pregnancy with a girlfriend of a few months. I am the last to know.

Then he tells me there are complications because his gf is going to move back to Germany with her family in May. We live in the US. I asked if he was going with her. No. In fact, they have been broken up for a while because they fought about parenting styles.

She's due in August. I was due June 1. They probably conceived on our family vacation at Thanksgiving. The one where I was pregnant but unaware that our baby's heart had already stopped.

I couldn't even ask him anything else because I was so shocked and upset, but I tried to keep it together and finish the hike down. I mean, what the actual fuck?

I know he didn't intend for this to happen. That it's all senseless and random- some pregnancies stick and some don't. But even if we hadn't lost our baby, it isn't really a happy situation for him. I don't even know if I will meet our niece.

42,2048,confidence,<praw.reddit.Reddit object at 0x7f12a630cd90>,,ttcafterloss,"Hi friends. Over the last few months I have been scouring the internet and reddit for anyone like me — so that I could know what to expect (even a little bit). I have done many nuanced searches and felt so frustrated and alone when I didn’t find the info I was looking for about my thyroid and my miscarriages. I am writing this post (and encourage others to contribute please!) for our future sisters looking for some comfort and help during a dark and scary time. So here is my story: 

I am currently 33 years old. I sustained a missed miscarriage at 8-12 weeks in mid July 2019 (unclear bc the baby started out “small” but there was a heart beat — so they modified my due date. I came back in a few weeks later and the baby stopped growing and the heart beat was gone) and a blighted ovum miscarriage in mid October 2019 at 6-8 weeks (they saw a gestational sack but no yolk sack — endured a painful 2 week wait to learn the baby never actually “took”) — two uncomplicated d and e’s with normal 2 week follow up results to check for remaining tissue. My period came back both times on day 34 or 35 after the d and e. 

Soon after my second miscarriage we did the full work up — which just concluded this week with my husband’s semen analysis. All things considered,  it has taken a full 4.5 months— including a few weeks where my RE made me take birth control to halt ovulation in preparation for a sonohysterogram— that felt really awful and counterintuitive, but I did it. It has included a full blood panel (full thyroid, lupus panel, rheumatoid arthritis panel d/t family history, blood clotting, metabolic panel), a 3D ultrasound on my uterus (to look for things like adenomyosis), a sonohysterogram (to look for cavity issues, which didn’t work at first bc of my anatomy — wasn’t associate with infertility but just made it hard to get the catheter in— they had to put me under anesthesia and dilate my cervix), genetic testing on my husband and I, meeting with both an endocrinologist and a reproductive endocrinologist. All has come back normal —- except for my thyroid panel. 

My tpo antibodies came back 58 back in November 2019 — which suggested I had an autoimmune condition associated with my thyroid — but there was no way to tell yet which one it was bc my doctor hypothesized that I had postpartum thyroiditis — essentially your thyroid “dumps” all the hormones out into your body when you lose the baby/ give birth and it appears like you’re hyper (in this case, Graves’ disease bc it’s the associated autoimmune condition). After a few months, your numbers tend to swing back to the hypo state (low free t4, high tsh). If you do have hashimotos, you will stay in that hypo state if left untreated. I continued with monthly thyroid panels and a single thyroid ultrasound. In February 2020, my tsh spiked to around 16 within a month (hypo) after months of tsh below 1. This confirmed her hypothesis — she concluded, at baseline,  i have hashimotos and had postpartum thyroiditis for a few months. My doctor immediately started me on 88 micrograms of levothyroxine on February 3rd 2020. This entire month, I have stopped eating around 7 or 8 pm and have waited  45 minutes to 1 hour every morning to eat after taking my pill to help with absorption. I take all my vitamins before bed— usually around 10pm. As of yesterday (March 6th, 2020), I am in the “perfect range.”  My free t4 didn’t change too much throughout the journey, but it was consistent with my tsh (fairly inverted). I was told that once my tsh was below 2.5, I should be able to start trying again — which means I’m now in the clear. I was also told that uncontrolled hypothyroidism doesn’t “cause miscarriages,” but it does increase the risk considerably — I have a PhD in an unrelated field — I’m still not entirely sure what they were trying to emphasize (other than correlation does not imply causation), but whatever. Anyway — I was so worried about how long it would take for the treatment to impact my numbers — no one could tell me what to expect — 1 month? 4 months? A year?!? I imagine it’s different for everyone, but it took a little over 1 month for me.  I’m going to limit my dairy intake and gluten now — from what I can tell there’s a lot of anecdotal evidence to suggest it helps with thyroid function  — and I’m going to try — bc why not?Same thing with progesterone — I’m going to start it as soon as I get my period (per my RE) — anecdotal evidence that it can help with fertility  — but hey, I’ll try it. I am currently on day 36 of my cycle (usually have 35 day cycles), so that’s the one remaining question for me (since every other month has been pretty consistent). I have my follow up endo appt on Monday to discuss next steps and ask where the heck my period is. Any who — my husband made me a graph of my test results, which I hope will help some of you in the future. Ok that’s enough from me. I hope that someday this post helps one of you. Keep fighting the good fight sister... I have no clue if I’ll ever get pregnant, but I finally have hope again for the first time since July — and it feels good. Even if it’s 5 years later, please feel free to message me with any questions and ask for an update if that helps your fears — maybe I’ll have a baby. Maybe I’ll be childless traveling the world - trying to enjoy my life despite continued fertility issues - either way, I know I’ll end up ok.

So to begin.. I experienced a MMC on March 19, 2019. It was an unplanned pregnancy, but very welcome. After the loss I took some time to heal and then changed jobs. Since I'm in the US I waited the minimum amount of time I could before trying again (for FMLA). 

Well here I am about to be 6 cycles into TTC and I'm not pregnant. Since I wasn't trying the first time and I have a history of PCOS I have no idea how long it took the first time. I have developed an unhealthy obsession with peeing on test strips, temping and tracking symptoms. I've started taking supplements to try to regulate my hormones and hopefully ovulate more regularly. I'm spending a lot of money on these things and I'm not even sure if it's what I need. 

So a few days ago I'm watching one of my favorite TTC YouTube channels FieldsFam and she is talking about a kit called Modern Fertility. How it's an at home hormones testing kit to help you get an idea of what is going on with your body. The thing is, it cost $150. I'm really struggling with trying to decide if this is the right next step in my journey.

At what point do you start justifying spending more and more money on TTC? My husband is under the impression we just need to do more baby dancing. Where as I am concerned that this is a much bigger issue.

I had to TFMR my 8th pregnancy at 18 weeks this past January for triploidy. She would have been due just before my birthday in June. For three days, after good 12 week scans and tests and before I found out about the suspected triploidy I felt a joy I hadn't felt in years. My grief counselor says it's as if I was holding my breath until everything would be okay.

I have a living child from my second pregnancy, and the rest of my losses are unrelated and without cause. I have had every kind of test possible, and there is no medical reason anyone can find. My husband is unsure about trying again, and any future child would be 8 years younger than our living child. My family is Catholic but any faith I had left I lost with my daughter.

I am writing today because all of the people I know in real life who have had some kind of loss have had fewer losses, and then babies, all in less time. And in some small way, they have moved on with their lives. Even though my grief counselor works with this population and says I'm not alone in this, she's never actually given me any examples to imply otherwise. With the exception of my first loss, it has been almost five years of living in this void. I feel no sense of relief if I think about choosing to stop (which would mean long term birth control).

I don't know who I am anymore and I have no real interest in figuring it out. I have lived in this grief for years so I can do all the normal life stuff and act like a functional human being. I have a job. I have hobbies. I can make small talk. I am present for my child, but my child is growing and independent. I have tried to fill the void in my life by making sure my child has a relationship with cousins and close friends, and I know people are grateful to me for that, but it has been years and it's not the same thing. I don't feel fulfilled. I don't have the sense of relief I see on the faces of the women I know who had a baby and put this all behind them. And I have to face the fact that I may never get that.

Hey guys. I wanted to post an update about the blood work I had done and ask opinions on how my doctor is addressing my RPL. 

Each test he ordered went to the Mayo Clinic and all came back fine except for those related to lupus anticoagulant. All of those results were weird and one pointed strongly towards me having LAC. 

A doctor at the Clinic shared his insights and interpretations and concluded that my results indicate that I am on heparin or another blood thinner, so basically he doesn’t think I have LAC.

I have never taken blood thinners. 

So my OBGYN called today and said, after reading the results, that I don’t have a clotting issue but he still wants me to do the aspirin/heparin regimen as soon as i have success and i’ll get a referral to a MFM asap. 

I’m at a loss. Why would he put me on an injectable medicine that costs a small fortune if he doesn’t think I need it? Shouldn’t he send me for a repeat test in 6-12 weeks to see what the results say then, and shouldn’t he look into why my results say i’m currently taking heparin when i’m not? Is it dangerous to take heparin if I don’t need it?

It’s been a long road and as much as I thought I wouldn’t have to come back here; I’m so glad this group exists. I wanted to do a proper introduction because so much has changed since I was last in here. 

I’m a 33 turning 34 year old trying to conceive with my 32 year old husband. I’ve gotten every test under the sun done. My husband still hasn’t had a sperm analysis and he has some pretty strong feelings about not getting it done. 

I’m currently going through my fourth loss at home. First three were almost identical. 6w3d stopped growing, found out between 8-10 weeks. Did karyotyping. All came back normal. Was diagnosed with Graves’ disease after my last miscarriage, so I was on PTU for this one and still didn’t work. Was prescribed Letrozole for this round. Got pregnant on the first cycle. Went in at 6 weeks to get my hcg’s done and they were 300. Did an ultrasound and there was nothing there. I have a D&C scheduled on Friday, but hoping it happens at home before then.

So here I am. Going to try a couple things different this time.

71,2048,confidence,<praw.reddit.Reddit object at 0x7f12a630cd90>,,ttcafterloss,"I'm sorry if this isn't the right place to post. I'm also sorry for this wall of text. This is my account of why I had to terminate a wanted pregnancy, due to a condition I had never even heard of.

My husband and I had been trying for baby number 2. On 12/30/19, I got a positive pregnancy test, but my gut told me something was wrong. I immediately went to the doctor's office after work, and even though I was only a few days late, they gave me a sonogram. The technician took one look, and told me I needed to go to the hospital. She brought in the doctor, who confirmed that the pregnancy was in the wrong spot. They couldn't help me in the office, so they sent me to the emergency room with images and a referral note. This let me skip the line in the waiting room.

That first visit lasted from four in the afternoon until about midnight. After multiple, multiple sonograms, they couldn't confirm the exact location of the embryo. The options were it was in the right spot after all, it had embedded in the cervix, or that it had landed within the c-section scar. They let me go home that night, but set me up with an appointment in their OB/GYN clinic for the very next day. That second visit confirmed the embryo had implanted in the c-section scar, the rarest of all ectopic pregnancies, with less than a 1 in 20,000 chance of occurring. The clinic sent me back to the hospital, where I would end up staying for 11 days.

Once I was back in the hospital, the doctors discussed the options with me. Trying to keep the pregnancy was not one of them, as the scar tissue cannot support a developing pregnancy. It would eventually rupture and cause severe bleeding, hysterectomy, and/or death. Because of the rarity of the situation, there wasn't a large pool of data to pull from, but some things were clear. 7-15% of pregnancies would rupture after treatment began. Multiple doses of methotrexate had about a 70% chance of working. If a surgical option were used, nearly all patients experienced severe hemorrhaging, with about half of those leading to complete hysterectomy. To prevent hemorrhage, a uterine artery embolization (UAE) could be done prior to the surgery. A UAE is where a substance is injected into the uterine arteries, greatly restricting the flow of blood. The caveat: only about 50% of patients who had a UAE were able to have a successful pregnancy afterwards. With all this in mind, we opted to try the multiple doses of methotrexate.

I was one of the lucky 30% that the treatment absolutely failed for. Methotrexate is a chemotherapy agent that destroys all rapidly dividing cell tissue in the body, not just fetal tissue. The shots were given intramuscularly every other day, with vitamin shots given on off days. It made me so sick. Every day that a shot was given, betas were also drawn. They were looking to see a 15% decrease over a 48 hour period. This never happened. I received the maximum number of doses they could give, to no avail. 

Because the doctors knew we wanted to have another pregnancy, they offered a semi-experimental treatment. They would insert a catheter into my uterus through my cervix, and inflate the balloon. This would put pressure on the area, and hopefully cut off the flow of blood. This would negate the need for the UAE and surgery. I agreed, and they made the attempt, using a sonogram as a guide.

It was the most painful thing I had ever experienced until that point. Having the balloon inflated caused immense, cramping pain. And unfortunately, it was unsuccessful. They showed me on the sonogram that the balloon was too small to put adequate pressure on the area. They wanted to try again, with a larger balloon. At this point I was crying from pain. One of the doctors reminded me that I could stop at any point. She also pointed out that once the balloon was in place, it would have to remain there for 48 hours, presumably hurting the whole time. I called it off there and then, and the UAE was scheduled for later that same day.

Remember how I said the above was the most painful experience until that point? Recovery from the UAE managed to beat that. It was so bad I was drenched in sweat. My blood pressure and pulse also plummeted, getting down to the 30s. Someone finally took pity on me, and I was set up with a dialauded pump, as well as an oxygen mask. The surgery was scheduled for the next day.

The surgery, thankfully, happened uneventfully. The UAE did its job and I didn't hemorrhage. I was released the next day, 12 days after I had found out I was pregnant, 11 days after being admitted to the hospital. 

The whole situation has sent me into a horrible depression. I wasn't allowed to be outpatient because of the possibility of rupture, and also because of the methotrexate side effects. It felt like I had a bomb strapped to me, waiting to go off. I felt (and still feel) guilt, that my body had betrayed this second baby, that I chose my life over his/hers. On 3/25, I have an appointment for a hysteroscopy, so they can evaluate my uterus. They'll hopefully give us the all-clear to try again, an idea which terrifies me.

I lost my baby two days ago. 

Well, in medical terms, my embryo, as it hadn’t developed a heartbeat nor any distinguishing features.

Another baby to have been born into our wonderful, close-knit, family. I feel like one of the lucky ones in a way, not having to hear the first heartbeat or feel the first movement, the first ultrasound measurements and confirmations. Still, I mourn, because having a daughter who has enriched our lives so extensively, I know what could have been. 

Today, as my body is still processing the loss, I am trying to choose to trust that it knows something I do not.

I also posted this in r/infertility, but after thinking about it, it made sense to post it in here too since many of you have probably been tested for clotting/immune disorders. 

All of my other results so far have been perfectly normal, including my testosterone (which somehow dropped from 56 to 38 in a year, and from 96 five years back) but my results for LAC came back funky.

I know this is not a definite diagnosis and I need to have the test redone in 3 months from the original test date. However, I'm assuming this means I'm also not allowed to TTC during those months, since we don't know if I would need to take aspirin/heparin to increase my chances of a LC. I have a history of loss (4MC, 0LC) which is why the doctor decided to test for autoimmune issues along with my TSH etc. My family does have a long history of blood clots, but I can't find anything definite on whether this is genetic or not. This whole ordeal, and the less-than-ideal pregnancy outcomes, have made me start thinking that maybe surrogacy or adoption is the better and safer route if I do have LAC.

Nice to meet you! I am a 25 years old and from Canada. I’ve had 2 miscarriages and a chemical pregnancy, all since we started trying in July 2019. The first miscarriage was at roughly 6 weeks, I miscarried naturally. The following cycle I got a BFP, that kept getting lighter until it was a BFN. In December I got another BFP and was so excited. I thought I was 14 weeks when bleeding had me sent for an ultrasound to find out I had a blighted ovum that only measured 8 weeks. I was walking around feeling and looking pregnant for 6 weeks with nothing growing inside of me. 

I was sad and discouraged after the first MC and the CP, but this one just hits differently. I took Misoprostol the last two nights and am still bleeding quite heavily. It’s so hard this time because I thought I was in the second trimester. The thought of starting over again scares me. I told my husband I may need some time off before trying again because passing an empty sac and the placenta was so traumatizing. He is supportive of my decision no matter what, but he said “we can’t have a baby if we don’t try” I want to be a mother more than anything. 

The thought of temping and stocking up on more OPKs and HPTs and having timed sex sounds so unappealing to me right now. I am so angry at my body and feel like it keeps betraying me.

Anyway, thank you for listening to my ramblings.

Before pregnancy my cycles were always 28 days long. I have a feeling they will be longer now for a while.

I had a miscarriage at 7 weeks on Christmas Day. My bleeding lasted for about 6 days and then I finally got my next period on January 31st. We were hoping to try that cycle but we waited too long and ovulation was hard to track. I didn’t ovulate until about 22 days after my miscarriage started. 

This month I ovulated on CD 18. I’m not sure when my projected period will be but I’m on CD27 right now.

No repeat losses, no late losses, no massively long time period of infertility. That’s part of why I honestly don’t get why this hurts so much. 

I got pregnant by accident two years ago at the age of 26. I wanted to go ahead with the pregnancy, but it turned out to be a MMC at around the 7 week mark. I was still long distance with my husband, unsupported by my family, incredibly stressed about the pregnancy itself, and had to wait two and a half weeks before getting a D+C. It caused a period of pretty bad acute PTSD and I haven’t been the same since.

Now my husband and I live together and have been TTC for 6 months (7 cycles) now. I have mild endometriosis, but my family has excellent fertility, so I figured it would happen right away. I’ve been doing everything right. Testing, tracking, timing everything, taking the fancy prenatals and a couple other supplements, I won’t even touch caffeine. And...nothing. I can reliably take a pregnancy test in a few days, and I was hopeful about this cycle (I seemed to actually ovulate as per my BBT chart, which doesn’t seem to happen every time), but I’m pretty sure my period is coming. I think my luteal phases are too short (10 days), but there isn’t a whole lot I can do about that now. 

I saw an endometriosis specialist a few weeks back, and she’s not opposed to doing an excision surgery, especially since I last had a laparoscopy 9 years ago. But since I’m not in extreme pain and mainly want to get/stay pregnant, we decided a better plan would be to refer me to a fertility clinic in the same building. My appointment is in June. I know it’s not technically infertility until the one year mark has passed, but because of my diagnosis and previous loss, they’ll take me after 6 months of trying. 

At the same appointment, I saw my old surgical records, and I found out my MMC in 2018 was basically an empty sac with some placenta tissue. Which was gutting. I was talking to an empty mass I thought of as a baby. My husband and I thought he was a boy. We named him. I’m really spiritual and always thought I’d see him again in some kind of afterlife one day. But since I found out about the empty sac, it feels weird and artificial to say his name. And I used to picture him as this little chunky redhead baby (my husband’s a ginger), but I can’t see him in my mind anymore. And I hate it. It gave me some kind of bittersweet comfort, and for now, it’s mostly gone. 

To top it all off, I’m pretty sure someone I considered a good friend, who went radio silent as soon as she would have found out she was pregnant (I only found out this was the likely reason months later by way of a public announcement), has just straight-up ghosted and is not coming back. I think it was initially to protect my feelings, but it’s either spiraled into chronic avoidance, or she doesn’t miss me. I’m giving her some leeway as she’s busy juggling career stuff (she’s a musician, as am I, she was kind of a mentor to me, that’s how we met) and raising her infant daughter, but I just don’t feel good about it.

&#x200B;

Sorry in advance for the wall of text. After my D&C last Wednesday at 11w6d, my boss told me yesterday that he'll be leaving our nonprofit in 6 months at the end of August. So, not only am I facing not having a baby in September, but losing my very favorite colleague. We're a teeeeny-tiiiiiiny group with 3 full-time staff members and I took this job across the country about 4.5 years ago just to be able to work with my boss. OH and I also just bought a house closer to family and in a city we love, so I work from home two days a week and commute about 100 miles each way, three days a week to keep working with my team. I've never worked with an executive director as awesome as my boss and would move mountains for him. I'm devastated on so many levels about all that has gone on in this last week. Anyway...

We are TTC, as soon as the dr clears me, which should be in about 6 weeks. So, best case, if I get pregnant again quickly and all goes well this time, I'd be delivering in January - February 2021. I'm on the older side of TTC and so I'm not skipping any months of TTC, so I need to figure out the best timeline for job hunting, while also considering maternity leave. I've got really transferable skills in the nonprofit world and about 18 years of experience and should be able to find work near our new house relatively easily. That said, my field is small and relies on good relationships and everrrrrryone knows if you burn bridges. Here are my thoughts and I'd love to hear your advice, experience, etc.

\- **Start Job Hunting Now:** I risk upsetting my current colleagues and board of directors (thus, risking future recommendations, etc.). I know my board is expecting me to be an integral part of the search process and staff transition.

\- **Job Hunt After the New Boss Starts:** I could be showing while interviewing, which feels dangerous for my prospects. I also don't love the idea of starting a new job and then going on maternity leave right away.

\- **Take Maternity Leave at Current Job, Stay for a Few Months, then Job Hunt:** I'm leaning toward this, but it just feels like forever. It locks me into staying at my job for probably another 18 months, if all goes well on the TTC front.

Obviously, if I'm not pregnant by the time my boss leaves, all this is moot, but I'm a planner and I like to have a road map.",t2_5d67vhzg,False,,0,False,Job Hunting and TTC?,[],r/ttcafterloss,False,0,,0,,,False,t3_f919dv,False,dark,1.0,,public,1,0,{},,b22615aa-711f-11e4-97ba-12313b0e92a7,False,[],,False,False,,{},,False,1,,False,self,1582590945.0,,[],{},,True,,1582619230.0,text,0,,,text,self.ttcafterloss,False,"<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=""md""><p>TW: mention of miscarriage</p>

I have a two year old son, and I miscarried my second pregnancy last month. Found out it wasn’t a viable pregnancy January 13, and had to be rushed to the hospital for an emergency D&C one week later.

The whole ordeal was traumatic. And I’ve been just devastated at the thought that I may never be able to give my son a sibling or at least not one close to him in age.

Then last week, my son got sick on our cruise vacation with my in-laws. He’s fine, but was feverish and snotty and just in a terrible mood. The three of us slept very poorly all week since he had to sleep between us in our bed and would toss, turn, and scream all night. He threw more and worse tantrums than we’ve ever seen from him.

We still had fun, don’t get me wrong. And we handled it the best we could, but it was rough. He wasn’t feeling good, was in an unfamiliar place, and is two years old. Of course he acted up.

But for that time, I was grateful to be the parent of an only child. Our focus was on him. No older sibling who was losing out on his/her vacation time with their parents because mom and dad kept having to tend to younger brother. No little baby sibling who would be woken up and upset by his tantrums.

I’ve always wanted more than one child. And honestly, I still do. But I’ve been so desperate for another, so dejected by my failure to get pregnant for nearly a year followed by a loss when it finally happened, so eager to know when it’s safe to try again, that I think I lost sight of things. But I’m weirdly grateful for this tough time with my son this week because it’s caused me to believe that the worst case scenario (never being able to have another) may not be so bad.

UPDATE: so, the talk happened and I don’t know how to feel about it. She never apologized, and repeated the same “SIL could have died” story three or four times. She explained how they were devastated about our loss and then everything happened with SIL, and they were grateful not to lose them too. 
She is pushing me to contact and see SIL, who has made it sound like I have been avoiding contact and her reaching out. She even told me that SIL told her that my niece told me to stop in when she ran in the house to check on her mom- she clearly said “be right back!” So no, i was not invited inside.
I am also being pushed to attend the baby shower, which I refuse to go to, and i feel that they should be more understanding. 

Maybe i’m insensitive but bottom line is i feel that SIL is twisting words and is mad that the attention isn’t all on her, and playing to her mother’s concern. 






Okay. Brief history since i’m sure most of you know my story. My husband and I have been married for just over 4 years. We have been TTC since. I’ve had 2 CP’s, one 6 week MC, and one 10 week MMC, which we discovered january 7. I miscarried the embryo with the first round of miso, and a lot of blood, but not much tissue. They gave me a second round two weeks later and that did nothing. They finally did a D&C on January 27, and after passing tissue after that, i stopped bleeding two weeks ago after bleeding for a month. The doctor didn’t do any genetic testing even though i asked him to and he is just now interested in testing for autoimmune issues. It’s a reality that i may never have bio children and that hit me hard while recovering. I am just now starting to feel physically and emotionally a little bit more like myself.

During all of this, my SIL, who was 22 weeks pregnant with a low-lying placenta, decided to go on a cruise, which lasted 5 days and included a 28 hour round trip car ride. On the last day, she woke up around midnight covered in blood and clots. They rushed her to the port and then to the hospital, where they said she had a tear in her placenta. Her baby survived, and she is doing well, and NOT on full bedrest. Her mother was on the cruise with her and therefore experienced her issues firsthand, and learned of our loss around the same time. 

During the weeks since she got home, i haven’t been able to go see her. All she talks about is the baby and who else is pregnant, and then announcing what they’re having (almost all girls, like I was supposed to) so i avoid her. She also has a “meal train” service so friends and family bring her dinners, flowers, etc and take her LC places. 

We were left alone after receiving a few condolences. The family that knew I was so weak from blood loss after miso that I was too tired to cook never offered us dinner. After the D&C, my husband had to pull some strings and come home early from work because I wasn’t supposed to be alone. My MIL suggested I go sit with my SIL. My mother stepped in and sat with me, helped me clean, and cooked dinner a few times. 

Now. MIL and FIL just came home from vacation. After helping them unpack today, my MIL waited until we were alone and unleashed a tirade of anger, about how no one in the family can believe that we didn’t cook for them, how i’m selfish and self-centered, and how they were excited about our baby but now it’s time to focus on SIL and her bay, etc. She then looked at me and said she understood the lack of contact during the first week but that I have no excuse after that. I didn’t say a word and walked out. Now, MIL wants to talk tomorrow and work things out. My husband will be going too. 

AITA? It’s been 7 weeks. I’m slowly becoming okay with baby stuff and I think I will feel better when we’re able to start trying again.

The first day of the blood I woke up to go to the toilet and when I wiped there was 1 small drop of bright red blood on toilet paper. I wiped again and nothing. I checked my cervix after that and got some obvious clear ewcm that stretched about 10cm, with no trace of blood (directly after I had wiped) I figured period was coming any moment as I'd been lightly crampy and moody. But nothing! I took a test because 8days prior my hcg was only down to 573 so I ordered a bunch of tests and planned to do a test every Friday until I got a negative, then hopefully positives again after that with a new pregnancy. The test was extremely faint positive. I thought ok I must be able to ovulate my hcg has quickly gone down, yah! I put my moon cup in just incase my period started over night, when I woke up there was just 1 drop of blood mixed with clear ewcm. Ok weird. I checked my cervix, it was high, soft and open. That night I was sure my period would start as I had been crampy on and off and not to mention totally bloated all week. So I put my moon cup in again. The next morning (today) I took it out and there was even less blood and ewcm then the day before. I checked my cervix and this time it was so high I could almost not reach it, completely open and the softest it's ever been, like mush almost! I did another test hoping it would be completely negative but instead it was slightly darker than the one 2 days prior, but I had drunk alcohol the night before and it may have dehydrated me making the hcg stronger in urine. I was so confused, am I ovulating or am I about to get my period? I wanted to have sex but I felt damp, I wiped and was pink cm. I checked my cervix and when I pulled my finger out it was bright red blood, no mucous. Ok so I AM getting my period. I put the cup in again.

The first day of the blood I woke up to go to the toilet and when I wiped there was 1 small drop of bright red blood on toilet paper. I wiped again and nothing. I checked my cervix after that and got some obvious clear ewcm that stretched about 10cm, with no trace of blood (directly after I had wiped) I figured period was coming any moment as I&#39;d been lightly crampy and moody. But nothing! I took a test because 8days prior my hcg was only down to 573 so I ordered a bunch of tests and planned to do a test every Friday until I got a negative, then hopefully positives again after that with a new pregnancy. The test was extremely faint positive. I thought ok I must be able to ovulate my hcg has quickly gone down, yah! I put my moon cup in just incase my period started over night, when I woke up there was just 1 drop of blood mixed with clear ewcm. Ok weird. I checked my cervix, it was high, soft and open. That night I was sure my period would start as I had been crampy on and off and not to mention totally bloated all week. So I put my moon cup in again. The next morning (today) I took it out and there was even less blood and ewcm then the day before. I checked my cervix and this time it was so high I could almost not reach it, completely open and the softest it&#39;s ever been, like mush almost! I did another test hoping it would be completely negative but instead it was slightly darker than the one 2 days prior, but I had drunk alcohol the night before and it may have dehydrated me making the hcg stronger in urine. I was so confused, am I ovulating or am I about to get my period? I wanted to have sex but I felt damp, I wiped and was pink cm. I checked my cervix and when I pulled my finger out it was bright red blood, no mucous. Ok so I AM getting my period. I put the cup in again.

[Temp Chart](https://imgur.com/a/bAstQiN)

TLDR: Had an ectopic in July of 2019. I'm on cycle three post resolution of that ectopic and my ovulation test just doesn't make sense to me.

Longer version:

I had three rounds of MTX from August to November to resolve an ectopic (my first and only pregnancy thus far at age 36). I had a 40 day cycle after I finally resolved the ectopic where I didn't TTC (doctor's advice).

Then I had a 28 day cycle where I did TTC, but my ovulation tests didn't really line up with my temp data. My chart has an orange dot for ovluation on CD 14 last cycle, which aligns with the peak ovulation test from the day before.

Now I'm on my second cycle of trying again, and got a surprise peak ovulation test today on CD 9. (I've never had one this early before, even when I was TTC last year before my ectopic. I always got my temp shift and peak ovluation test in sync and usually between CD12-14.) The ovulation tests I took on this cycle CD 7 and 8 were negative. Fortunately we did the whole BD thing last night.

Part of me panicked and immmeditely took a pregnancy test, because this is how my ectopic happened last time. I had had my period, and when I had taken an ovulation test it was a dye stealer. So I had then taken a pregnancy test and it was positive. No such positive pregnancy test today, so I'm hoping that's a good sign that I'm not having that bullshit ectopic thing happen again.

I am just so frustrated. Could this be a false start kinda deal, where I don't actually release an egg despite a surge? I've read about some women having two LH surges.

Last month my husband and I were thrilled to find out I was pregnant with our third child. At 37, I was worried it may take us a while to conceive but we were lucky enough to conceive in our third month (my first son took nearly a year, and I was much younger then). The timing seemed perfect and our baby even shared a due date with my younger child--October 9. 

However, as week 5 came and went, I started to get nervous. I had no morning sickness. With both of my living children I had been extremely sick from weeks 4-11. Vomiting up to 8 times per day and just feeling generally awful. With this pregnancy, I felt great. No vomiting, no food aversions. I could even drink coffee. Everyone said to consider myself lucky but it felt wrong. By 6.5 weeks I was really concerned. My OB's nurse told me not to worry, as each pregnancy is different. My OB, however, said she trusted women's intuitions about their bodies and sent me for an HCG draw. I got my test done and that same night while I was awaiting results, I went to the bathroom and noticed pink on the tissue. My heart sank and I started crying. The spotting turned bright red and I was up all night with painful cramping. I cried all night for my little October baby. 

The next morning I called my OB's office and told them what was going on. They said to hang tight and someone would get back to me. I waited 7 hours and tried to stay busy at work but I really should have stayed home. I had an important meeting but I cried all day and was generally useless. My bleeding had intensified and my cramping very much hurt but I didn't want to take anything for it, not knowing for sure that it was a loss. 

Finally I got frustrated and called back. They told me I needed an ultrasound right away so I had to drop everything and run to get one before the radiology dept closed. Because I had to leave work suddenly, I needed to tell my bosses what was happening and that was tough. I was frustrated that no one mentioned an ultrasound when I called that morning. (With my first miscarriage, I did not get one.) 

The ultrasound was uncomfortable and I had to wait a half hour after for the radiologist to review the slides and talk to my doctor. I then (wrongly) assumed that either the radiologist or my doctor would tell me what was going on. Instead, the tech sent me home and said my doctor would call me in the morning and he couldn't say anything else. I was so upset. I knew I'd lost the baby but you're really going to let me go home and bleed all night and not even tell me if my baby died?  My OB did end up calling me in the evening, at least, and did not make me wait until morning. She said there was nothing in my uterus and my HCG was lower than she'd expect for how far along I was. I'd probably lost the baby some weeks back. 

It was a horrible day. My bleeding has slowed down considerably and I am thankful that it does not appear I will need any intervention for retained tissue. But I want my baby.

I had a CP in January on our last cycle before my husband and I planned to start actively trying. I couldn't believe that I might be a largely unintentional unicorn, and got crazy excited. My biggest wish has always been to be a mum, and my biggest fear has always been that I won't be able to. 

My test got darker the morning after my first positive, but my husband didn't believe it was really a positive (he's a ""two lines of equal darkness"" kind of guy). The following day, which was also my first day at a brand new job, I had pretty uncomfortable cramping. I rushed home during the lunch break to take another test, hoping that I'd be able to show the even darker lines to my husband and celebrate together before going back to work. This test was way lighter, and I went back devastated, knowing that I was having a CP. It took a few more days for my period to finally come, with one final negative test the day before it finally arrived. 

This cycle, which is our first actively trying, I tried to be really optimistic. I never got a truly positive OPK, but wasn't able to do these consistently due to work and travel, so figured that was still OK. We hit most of the days we wanted to, and AF hadn't shown up today as expected. I'd also had more CM than usual during my LP.

We are currently on our honeymoon and I thought about how amazing it would be to have a BFP during this trip. I held off as long as I possibly could, and then took a test this AM on what I think is probably 11 DPO. It was the starkest BFN.

I'm trying not to let it get to me, because I know that two cycles is so early in the scheme of things. But I can't help worrying that there's something wrong with my body and I'll never carry a pregnancy to term. I guess I just wanted to vent a bit since I don't feel comfortable sharing how I'm feeling with any friends/family, as I don't want people to know we're TTC.

I peed on a stick at 4:30 and I could tell the line was there 2 minutes later. It was faint but it had color and it was there. I took another test 11 hours later at 3am and it was so there and pink but still faint..

3 hours later i started bleeding, heavy. I couldn’t believe it was already over. I had just gotten the positive test, how could it be happening so soon, my body didn’t even give it a chance. (My HCG blood test was 7)

I only knew I was pregnant for 10 hours and it was the most exciting time of my life. I’ve never wanted something so badly in my life. 

I cried and cried and cried when the bleeding got heavier and heavier. I couldn’t find the words to convey how much I was loosing. This was everything to me. No one else really understood why I was so upset, 

“you’ll get pregnant again.” “God’s plan.” “there was probably a chromosomal abnormality.” “1 in 3 pregnancies end in miscarriage.” “At least you got pregnant.” “Well it wasn’t a full on miscarriage.”

All these things just made it so much worse. I feel like my whole perspective on TTC has changed. All the little things I was so worried about didn’t mean a thing when I lost my baby. Worrying about cervical mucus, or my temps, or how much water i drink. 

I feel like a more dull version of myself. I’m just going through the motions hoping to feel something other than this god awful heartbreak. I know my feelings are valid but I feel like I should just “get over it” because I was only pregnant for a couple hours, i only knew for a little while.

I feel empty, like there’s a pit in my stomach that will never be full again. Another baby won’t make up for the baby i lost, it won’t take the pain away and it certainly won’t make me ever forget the heartbreak.

I’ve only ever had a light, short period with no cramping. So far things have been heavy, I’ve had so much cramping, and I’ve even gained 2lbs. Very different than what I’m accustomed to. 

Is this normal? Should I expect this whole cycle to be strange? I ovulate CD12-14, should I expect this cycle to be different? Do people typically have a longer cycle right after miscarriage? Issues with ovulation? Etc?
