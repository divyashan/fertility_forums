The next step was to visit a hematologist. I had an appointment with her at the end of this month, and was on a waitlist to try to come in sooner.

My husband and I were good for three months and then weren’t so careful on the fourth. I had a suspicion and started testing 11 days after I ovulated. The first one was negative. I got very faint positives every day after that.

But the line never got darker. I suspected it would be a chemical pregnancy, but I called the hematologist to try to get in sooner anyway. She got me in by Friday.

Friday morning (15dpo), I called the RE to tell them I fucked up and got pregnant, so they told me to come in for HCG and progesterone tests. HCG came back at 7.95, PG was 1.4. They prescribed me vaginal progesterone and told me to come back Sunday. That afternoon the hematologist told me she didn’t think my one copy of the Factor V Leiden gene was causing the miscarriages, so we’re still in the dark about that. Then I started bleeding. Heavy, with clots.

The RE told me to continue the progesterone until we knew more. I kept peeing on sticks. The barely visible line got slightly more visible. I started worrying that this was another ectopic pregnancy.

In my head, I reviewed my decision not to take methotrexate again and started making peace with losing a tube and possibly ending my journey of trying to conceive.

Sunday, my HCG was 8.1. Doc told me to keep taking the progesterone. I was resistant because now I was sure it was another ectopic, but I complied nonetheless. I just wanted to eat all the junk food and stay in bed, but Monday I still went to work, and tried not to think about it.

Tuesday, the nurse called to tell me my betas from that morning we’re negative and to stop taking the progesterone. I’m ashamed to say that my response was, “Great!

My whole life I have been told this would be really hard for me (I also have very high testosterone and a pcos diagnosis) and now I’m being told time is running out. </p>

<p>Sadly this pregnancy ended in an MMC and the baby stopped growing at 6.5 weeks. I just had my d&amp;c today. I am so scared of the future, I worry that my past medical issues contributed to my miscarriage and I can’t carry a healthy pregnancy. I’m so scared of this happening again and simultaneously running out of time. Has anyone been diagnosed with DOR and are in my shoes? I know one miscarriage may not have anything to do with my issues, but it’s so hard not to think about that.</p>

The hospital is still charging me as though the whole procedure was done as there was a room I was in and a doctor who met me for five minutes before leaving and meds/equipment taken out (even if not fully used).

I just need to vent and share my story..

MY DH & I started TTC in November after we finally decided we wanted another child ( We have a 4 yr old son). We got pregnant immediately and where very excited. I told my family  right away and started dreaming and hoping for the future. I’ll say naively, miscarriage was not on my mind, until I had a dream where I woke up covered in blood. I shook that off as anxiety and pregnancy dreams.

Then shortly after I woke up one morning to spotting and just new deep down something wasn’t right. 
I Called my OB to get in the next day and was confirmed I was having a miscarriage at 5.5 weeks. It was early, but honestly life shattering.  I guess the silver lining was that I passed it all naturally and it was mostly just like a heavier period that lasted for 8 days.
 
After going back for my follow up appointment 2 weeks later and confirming my HCG had gonna below 5, my OB gave me the go ahead to TTC after my next cycle. I ovulated 2 weeks later and then had my period the first week in January and told my husband it was time to starting trying. 
And it was honestly so awful.. the forced intimacy and how my husband wasn’t taking it seriously.. we have had some awful fights the past month because I’m feeling a lack
Of support and it made me even wonder if he wanted to have another child. 
That in its self is hard but to make matters worse.. I have a group of mom friends who have all conceived multiple children easily and without issue. there are two girls that are both recently pregnant and one of them I actually can’t stand and finding out she was pregnant with her 2nd destroyed me.  Needless to say I have pulled away from this group because I simply can not handle it. I’ve gone off social
Media as well and I’m just focusing on what’s in front of me.

Got my period 16 of Jan and as of the 22nd we're trying again. I just can't help but compare the feelings and mood of trying now to how it was before the loss.

It's weird cause we have coped with the loss. We're at a point where we reminisce about all the beautiful moments and happiness we experienced with our first. The happy mornings, the cuddling nights. We're not thinking of our baby as just a loss. We're in a good place concerning grief.

But in terms of intimacy and sex I feel like I'm in this limbo where I'll never enjoy it again.

39,2048,confidence,<praw.reddit.Reddit object at 0x7f12a630cd90>,,ttcafterloss,"Hi, everyone. I've been lurking here since I found it about a month ago, so it's long past time for me to introduce myself.

I lost a baby girl in November, at just over 21 weeks. It was my first pregnancy, after trying off and on for about a year.

At 13 weeks, I got the results back from the routine genetic screening my OB ordered for me: it turns out I'm a carrier for a fatal X-linked disease. (This was a huge shock, as there's no history of it in my family.) This mutation would be lethal if I passed it on to a son. They did a CVS right away to see what we were dealing with, and we discovered the baby was a girl: bullet dodged, right? I couldn't believe it.

When we did the anatomy scan 6 weeks later, they confirmed the baby was a girl -- and then they found some problems. After a bunch of followups, what we had was a gray diagnosis. The baby was missing one of her arms. She was small, measuring more than a week behind. And there was something weird in the brain scans, which maybe was nothing, but maybe was something. No information was available about prognosis. The maternal fetal medicine people were concerned about whether the pregnancy was sustainable. I tracked down the handful of studies that have been done to follow up similar diagnoses, which indicated that the risk of stillbirth or perinatal mortality was super elevated over baseline, but also definitely not 100%.

Oh, and a fun fact: it seems that these developmental problems had absolutely nothing to do with the X-linked genetic disease I'm a carrier for. Just two completely unconnected (extremely improbable) events.

We decided to TFMR. I hope you won't judge me for that, even though it wasn't a clear diagnosis. (This fear is the major reason why I haven't been completely open about my TFMR in my life, and the reason why I made an alt account when I joined this subreddit.) I don't know what would have happened if I had made a different decision, and I'll never know. That uncertainty is punishingly difficult. But I know I would choose the same way, if I had to make the choice again.

It's been 10 weeks since we said goodbye to her. Honestly, it's been harder than I expected. I want so much to have another child; but with a 1 in 4 chance of passing on a fatal disease to the next baby, we're afraid to TTC again. We're looking into IVF with genetic screening of the embryos, and I am terrified of this big, scary, confusing process... and also of what comes after that. And I miss my baby girl.

If you made it this far, thanks for reading all the way through the giant wall of text. I would love to hear about other people's stories. How did you get through it?

A bit of backstory is needed I suppose. I’ve had two pregnancies and two losses. I had a stillbirth at full term a few years ago. The father was a very abusive man and was not present at the time of her birth, I was alone. I’ve since become engaged to an amazing man who knows about this and is always there to support me when I feel the need to talk about my daughter. He is always willing to listen, provide insight, and be supportive. He acknowledges her as my child and never once has tried to exclude her from our family tree.

A few months ago my fiancé and I fell pregnant and were extremely excited as we’d been “trying but not trying” for a year. At seven weeks pregnant I ended up in the hospital and was diagnosed with an ectopic pregnancy. I was rushed to emergency surgery within half an hour of my diagnosis as it was very near bursting. I thankfully had an amazing surgeon and I will always be grateful to her for saving my life. 

I’ve had a very hard time coping with the loss of the ectopic pregnancy, but decided I wanted to begin actively trying as soon as was medically safe. This was our first cycle trying and I’m 5DPO. I’m terrified. I’m having second thoughts, I’m scared I’m not ready to be a mother. I’m scared to be pregnant; terrified I will have another loss. I really don’t think I can mentally handle three pregnancies in a row with no healthy baby at the end. I don’t know how to confide this in my fiancé. Every day that I get closer to my expected period I get more anxious. I don’t know whether I want the test to be positive or negative. My head is all over the place.

Is this normal? I don’t feel normal. I’m sorry if this post comes across as rambley (is that a word?). I just really needed to get this off my chest and I figured the people here would understand better than anyone. It’s to the point where I have myself in tears and I just don’t know what to do.

I decided to start temping and doing OPKs just to get into the habit. Tomorrow will be 4 weeks since my d&c so I am waiting on my period. I was told I could get it in 4-6 weeks after the d&c.

I am wondering if I have ovulated since my d&c or if I still might ovulate before I get my period.

Here is my timeline:

12/27 - had d&c

1/1 to now - BBT has been anywhere from 97.05 to 97.6. I am getting a lot of 97.33 and 97.18.

1/10 to 1/12 - had peak level double lines on OPK on 1/10 and stayed high until 1/12 although I could see it progressively went down as I tested several times each day. I also still tested positive on a pregnancy test at this time which makes me think the OPK was just picking up HCG. I think it's important to note that 1/10 was the first time I started testing with OPKs so I have nothing prior to that date to compare anything to.

1/13 to now - OPKs have been low. Did not take another pregnancy test until the 16th

1/16 to now - pregnancy tests are negative

Here are my questions:
- Could I have ovulated around 1/10 when the OPK peaked, even though I was still testing positive on the pregnancy test? I never had a rise in BBT so that makes me think I did not ovulate, although I've read it's possible to ovulate two weeks after a MC.
- If I didn't ovulate around the 10th, should I expect to ovulate soon, even though I should be getting a period soon? 

The low temps make me think I might ovulate before getting a period, but I have been having vivid dreams over the last several days. Google tells me that vivid dreams can be a symptom of PMS, which makes me think my period might be around the corner.

80,2048,confidence,<praw.reddit.Reddit object at 0x7f12a630cd90>,,ttcafterloss,"Hi!  Have a few questions I'm hoping you informal experts can help with...  After my MMC in August after 18 months of trying and no luck since, I dropped $300 on a Mira LH tracker and a ton of test strips.  The Mira tracker gives you the actual levels of LH, since I am really bad at telling the difference in darkness of lines and I wanted some actual numbers.  

I've been testing first thing every morning since my period stopped last Wednesday, and I was consistently low (less than 1) all week until yesterday.  My morning test was 14, which is still considered ""medium"" level, and the one I took at home (granted I didn't limit water intake before or wait two hours, I just had to pee) in the evening was also medium at 13.  We had our fun before bed, and I woke up this morning to a result of ZERO LH.

So I'm worried about three things...

One, why did it go up and down so quickly?  Even with the cheap OPKs I was getting positives a few days in a row.  I've read that some women may have a double peak type thing, but I couldn't find anything about the likelihood (like 1 in 70 women).  Plus, they didn't seem to go all the way down to zero between peaks.

Two, the fact that my peak was only 14, am I just not making enough?  I'm 35 and I did start my period at 9.

Finally, could this be in any way related to the miscarriage?  I was 12 weeks by my count, but the last measurement they took gave 8 weeks.  There was a heartbeat at the 8 week scan (by my count) measuring 6 weeks, 5 days.  Maybe a progesterone issue?

I'd go to my doc immediately, but I'm overseas as a military spouse and my regular doctor that went through the last 2 years with us is gone, so I'm having to start from scratch.  Plus, they're just the primary care doctors that write the referrals to the OB/GYN.  I see the new doc today for another issue, but I'm wondering if I should raise this as a concern (maybe he could give me progesterone?).  I'm afraid he's going to take the stance that since I did get pregnant once in two years, my husband and I are obviously capable of having kids.  I have two kids from a prior marriage, and they came without even trying, but that was 12 and 6 years ago (I'm going to be 35 in May).  If I do get a referral out of him, it'll take at least two months to be seen, but at least if that happens I'll have three months of LH tracking to show them...

I appreciate any info you all may have!

Hello and I’m sorry that we’re all here.

I had my first miscarriage today at 5+5. I’ve been researching about my cycle and how to start tracking again. We want to start trying again ASAP. I have postpartum thyroiditis (was diagnosed in August 2019 after having my son March 2019) and have been taking medication for about 4 months. My levels were finally normal when we started TTC and got pregnant fairly quickly. But here we are and I feel like once we did get pregnant my levels may have started getting whacky again. I noticed my hair falling out but I brushed it off as pregnancy hormones.

I’m getting bloodwork today to check my hcg level and TSH level. When I told my doctor that we were TTC he said that we may have to up my dosage of synthroid but that it would be checked at my first doctors appointment, which would have been in early March. I feel like that was so far away and my levels could’ve been off which could have caused this miscarriage.

Does anybody have experience with this? How do you manage your levels if you’re TTC? Should I request to get my TSH checked if we get a BFP in the future?

It’s been a couple years since first one and then we were pretty unsure about jumping into TTC right away. I decided pretty last minute (just before next fertile week) to go back on BC which would’ve been simple (use condoms as backup) if it weren’t for my anaphylaxis-inducing semen allergy. Got in an argument with a shitty nurse about that, who was all, “surely you can manage to use condoms or abstain”. My doctor ended up apologizing about it and said she was counseling the entire practice on semen allergy after that. About five years ago we traveled to Cincinnati where the one doc has developed a desensitization protocol for “seminal plasma hypersensitivity”. It was successful but, like allergy “shots” (please excuse the pun), I would need to be exposed to my husband’s semen about twice a week. Forever.

There’s a lot to talk about there but the point of this post is how it unfortunately relates back to miscarriage: despite the risk of infection with inserting anything into your vagina before your cervix closes, I really, immunologically, need to unleash an oral syringe of semen into my vagina (this in the event that we aren’t in the mood for sex or one of us is traveling) every fifth day (we’ve never tried anything past the holy holy “day five”). 

I used the syringe method actually the day before this mc. I can’t help but wonder whether I pressed the syringe a bit too forcefully and it dislodged the embryo, which I think I saw, attached to what I think is decidua placenta, and scooped up from the toilet in case the doc will send to pathology tomorrow. Ive asked several doctors about this scenario and they seem to think it’s not a big threat (especially if you compare it to thrusting during sex) but it’s not like there are any empirical priors.

I woke up this morning at exactly 2:59 a.m. and I never went back to sleep. I had a very realistic dream that her pregnancy continued and in fact she was starting to have labor pains. This dream was so realistic that we actually paid bills, went grocery shopping and I even was stuck in traffic. I literally lived months of my life, day by day with my wife. But waking up before I got to see that babies face has rattled me and I can't seem to shake the feeling. It's so strange to me to feel so strongly about a dream but I just wanted to see her face.

Due to my wife's new job, stress and so much more it's been difficult to talk to her. I've mentioned it to her in passing but she doesn't seem interested. And I don't mean that in a fowl way like she doesn't care to listen to me. When I finally felt that it was a good time to talk to her I said to her, ""that dream I had really messed me up."" And when I started to go into details, she interrupted me and said she was trying to finish watching her prerecorded Sunday church program that she missed. So I left the matter alone. It seems like I've missed my chance to talk to her about this because she's finally moved on. And now it seems like since it's now my turn to finally talk in order to let it go, I have no one to talk too. Which is why you're currently reading this. Like most men, including myself, I will just have to bottle it up and store it on the top shelf out of reach.

I just don't know how to handle it if that happens.

I became pregnant at the end of October, was confirmed in November, and I had a missed miscarriage in December which was managed with a d&c.

I had my two week follow up from the d&c last Friday and was cleared that I could have sex again but was told to wait a cycle before TTC. The nurse practitioner's reasoning was that if I tried to conceive too soon I could risk not having enough uterine lining. I can't remember her exact words but that was the gist.

So right now I am patiently awaiting AF. I bought an OPK and started using it about 8 days after the d&c to get used to how it works and get in a routine because I did not do this before. I have also been temping every morning since the first of January. When I first started the opks they were reading high, and I was also getting a faint line on hcg tests. I googled and found out that the opks don't differentiate lh from hcg, so I guess I still had some pregnancy hormones in my system that were causing the opks to read high. Ok.

For the last few days opks have been low and pregnancy test this morning showed barely visible, like really have to squint hard to see it, line. 

So, I'm glad that the pregnancy hormones seem to be going down because I really want to get my period and start trying again.

I have read a lot of people have their HCG levels tested. I have never been told, ever, throughout this whole process, what my hormone levels were, and no one has tested them since the miscarriage.

Hi there.  I also posted this in the miscarriage sub.  Hoping to connect for advice!  I have had 4 MCs (3 CP, 1 MMC).  All standard tests came back normal (even the chromosomal testing from my MMC was normal), but 2 controversial tests have come back positive.  I have MTHFR (homozygous for C677T) and I have high natural killer cells (13.84%).  I’ve had a very hard time even finding a doc who would test for the NKC and she doesn’t seem very motivated to treat them.  She basically said, we do intralipids in the office and you can get them if you want, but I don’t really believe in them.

Anyway - I’m hoping to connect with others who may have similar diagnoses.  What does your protocol look like?  Have you been successful?  Specifically - are you using intralipids, IVIg, prednisone, or lovenox or a combo?

I realize the lovenox is a blood thinner and more used for APA/clotting disorders.  I’ve heard some MTHFR carriers are on it.  I do take methylfolate and my homocysteine levels are in the normal range.

I have a planning appointment for next steps with my RE on 1/22 and I’m consumed with trying to self advocate.  She’s making it seem like she will start conservative before combining different therapies and the thought of a “trial and error” approach is repulsive to me. She continues to remind me that 60% of women with 6 miscarriages will go on to have a successful pregnancy with no treatment.  Um - I don’t want to hear that again!

She’s making it seem like she will start conservative before combining different therapies and the thought of a “trial and error” approach is repulsive to me. She continues to remind me that 60% of women with 6 miscarriages will go on to have a successful pregnancy with no treatment.  Um - I don’t want to hear that again!</p>

<p>Thank you in advance - I’m grateful for this community and I’m so sorry we’ve had to endure this hell.</p>

Hey All-

Was hoping to get some advice from folks in this group. I had my first D&C November 12 last year- my doctor told me that, after the initial bleeding from the procedure, a few weeks would pass and then I should get a period. After that first period I can start TTC.

Well after D&C bleeding (lasting about 14 days) and, 4 weeks after that, I had what I can barely even call a period. There was MILD brownish discharge for 2-3 days, not enough in total to fill the lightest of pads (my god... is this TMI?).

Anyway after that first ""period"" I have been testing for ovulation and nothing- all the digital tests are negative. What i use gives you a blank face if no evidence, a blinking smiley if its detecting hormones and you are in a fertile window, and a non-blinking smiley if your 24-48 hours from ovulation. I have only had a blank and im near when I thought I was supposed to get my next period...

So yeah this is making me fucking mad- I am angry at my body.

184,2048,confidence,<praw.reddit.Reddit object at 0x7f12a630cd90>,,ttcafterloss,"Intro post.. TL;DR: 5 years, IVF, fresh transfer, MMC

After 5 long years of TTC, we finally did an IVF cycle in October last year. I have diminished ovarian reserve, so I was a poor responder to stimulation and it looked like the cycle would be cancelled at one point. Somehow, we got 5 mature eggs at retrieval and with a serious stroke of good luck, 4 of those made it to the blastocyst stage (5 days). We transferred one at 5 days after my retrieval. It took. For the first time in 5 years, I was actually pregnant. Betas were a tad slow to rise, but did double (everyone said, ""it's okay! That's normal!""). At 7+3, I had a scan at the fertility clinic. Heartbeat was 129, but embryo measured 5 days behind (""things look good, but not perfect""). Was supposed to go back at 9+3. Clinic called to cancel my scan and send me for one where I live instead (clinic is a 3 hour drive from me). Went to my GP and a maternity doctor, who both gushed about me being so young and healthy and it was SO unlikely that anything could go wrong. The maternity doctor used an in-office ultrasound and ""saw"" a flicker - ""it's definitely a heartbeat!"" And besides, the clinic wouldn't have 'graduated' you if things weren't going well, right? An urgent request was sent for an ultrasound appointment, note on the request was ""patient anxious"". Christmas Eve. 10+4. No heartbeat. Stopped growing at 8+1. Would have definitely found this out at the canceled scan on December 16. It definitely did NOT have a heartbeat at the maternity doctor's office. Merry fucking Christmas. Took misoprostol on December 30 and miscarried after one dose, 6 hours after I took it. Worst experience of my life, hands down. The hormone crash was something that I can't even describe. Such a dark, hopeless hole.

TL;DR: 5 years, IVF, fresh transfer, MMC</p>

<p>After 5 long years of TTC, we finally did an IVF cycle in October last year. I have diminished ovarian reserve, so I was a poor responder to stimulation and it looked like the cycle would be cancelled at one point. Somehow, we got 5 mature eggs at retrieval and with a serious stroke of good luck, 4 of those made it to the blastocyst stage (5 days). We transferred one at 5 days after my retrieval. It took. For the first time in 5 years, I was actually pregnant. Betas were a tad slow to rise, but did double (everyone said, &quot;it&#39;s okay! That&#39;s normal!&quot;). At 7+3, I had a scan at the fertility clinic. Heartbeat was 129, but embryo measured 5 days behind (&quot;things look good, but not perfect&quot;). Was supposed to go back at 9+3. Clinic called to cancel my scan and send me for one where I live instead (clinic is a 3 hour drive from me). Went to my GP and a maternity doctor, who both gushed about me being so young and healthy and it was SO unlikely that anything could go wrong. The maternity doctor used an in-office ultrasound and &quot;saw&quot; a flicker - &quot;it&#39;s definitely a heartbeat!&quot; And besides, the clinic wouldn&#39;t have &#39;graduated&#39; you if things weren&#39;t going well, right? An urgent request was sent for an ultrasound appointment, note on the request was &quot;patient anxious&quot;. Christmas Eve. 10+4. No heartbeat. Stopped growing at 8+1. Would have definitely found this out at the canceled scan on December 16. It definitely did NOT have a heartbeat at the maternity doctor&#39;s office. Merry fucking Christmas. Took misoprostol on December 30 and miscarried after one dose, 6 hours after I took it. Worst experience of my life, hands down. The hormone crash was something that I can&#39;t even describe. Such a dark, hopeless hole. </p>

<p>Now I&#39;m waiting on my period to show so that I can prep for another transfer. I desperately want to be pregnant again, but I am also terrified of this happening again. At least now I know to advocate for myself and fight when I know things aren&#39;t right. Positive thinking and being hopeful solves absolutely nothing in this situation. I&#39;m sad to be here, sad that you&#39;re all here, but glad to have somewhere to vent.</p>

My first 2 cycles had pretty low LH surges and for all 3 cycles I had ZERO ovulation pain—and I *always* have ovulation pain. And despite religiously timing intercourse (at least 4 days leading up to a positive OPK and the 2 days after), we've had 3 months of BFNs.

I made an appointment with my OBGYN for this Wednesday (12 DPO) since I figure I'll either test positive for pregnancy or get a vaginal ultrasound that confirms my hunch. If I'm right, and I didn't ovulate, I'm planning to ask for Clomid or Letrozole to jump start things. 

For anyone who's been there, should I also expect him to order a full batch of tests on both of us or does that usually happen after a few rounds of unsuccessful O meds?

November 15, 2019 was my last period and it has been almost 9 weeks since. 

I took letrozole and ovidrel during this cycle for the first time as I started my cycle monitoring with the clinic. We had a timed intercourse after the ovidrel shot. I also didn't take any progesterone. On Dec 16 (4.5weeks) I went into clinic for blood test and it came positive at 12hcg.
I had some bleeding during this week which I presumed was miscarriage. 
 4 days later (Dec 20) it was only at 24hcg and they declared it as a loss and said it's chemical pregnancy. 
A week later on Dec 27 (6 weeks) the beta went up to 30.45 and they said it's abnormal and to go to ultrasound right away. Ultrasound didn't show anyything but they didn't rule out ectopic pregnancy which was what it was for. I didn't experience any pain that week. 
On Dec 30 my beta went down to 23.24
Jan 3 (7 weeks) beta went down again to 21.06 and they said they were hopeful it's going to get to 0 soon. 
Jan 8 (8 weeks) beta suddenly goes up to 57.95. The nurses tell me to go to ER right away as the beta is abnormal and they want to make sure it's not ectopic pregnancy. My husband took a day off and we went to the ER in the hospital. The doctor there said that my beta is low so ultrasound won't help as it won't see anything and that ectopic pregnancy usually happens when numbers are over 1500. So he basically said we wasted time coming there. He said to have the betas checked again next week. 

The next day my husband and I had an appointment with the fertility doctor and he said that my pregnancy is definitely not viable and that I will have to go to an early loss clinic next week to have them look at it. He also said that my betas have to be checked next Monday before going to the early loss clinic. Most likely I will have to take a pill to end the pregnancy. 

Today - Jan 13 I went to fertility clinic for blood work and I am waiting to hear back from them about my beta. I haven't had any blood or pain. 

Has anyone had such low and fluctuating betas in their 5-8 weeks? Did they confirm what kind of pregnancy loss was it? What are the best ways to end pregnancy without waiting for betas to drop to 0 naturally?

Good evening everyone,

Three weeks ago I had a devastating late miscarriage, which was conceived in a medicated cycle in between IUI and IVF. 

I have my first appointment back with my RE tomorrow morning to discuss some of my post-loss testing and implications of this loss on my fertility going forward.

<p>Good evening everyone,</p>

<p>Three weeks ago I had a devastating late miscarriage, which was conceived in a medicated cycle in between IUI and IVF. </p>

<p>I have my first appointment back with my RE tomorrow morning to discuss some of my post-loss testing and implications of this loss on my fertility going forward. All I know right now is the fetus’s genetic testing was normal, all my basic testing (thyroid, INR, etc.) was normal, and the physical pathology on the fetus and placenta were normal (ie, visually normal it’s gestational age, etc).

In September 2018 I had a TFMR at 21 weeks pregnant. It was my first pregnancy and my baby boy had significant defects in his brain, heart, spine, and kidneys which made him 'incompatible with life'. It was the hardest thing I have ever experienced. Since then I've had multiple chemical pregnancies that miscarried at 4-5 weeks so not nearly as heartbreaking, but still takes its emotional toll. 

Even though it's been over a year, I still struggle with the loss. When I first was grieving, I wrote baby boy a lullaby, sung to a familiar tune but I changed all the words to reflect the hopes and dreams I had for him, and the life I wished I could give him. That helped me to process my emotions and essentially say goodbye. But now I feel like it's been too long for me to still feel heartbroken, and singing to nothing seems silly now. It's making TTC (or even thinking about TTC) hard too.. Too many mixed emotions. My SO doesn't seem phased at all. It never affected him like it did me (he never felt him kick or carried him around though so I guess I understand why it's not as traumatic for him).
