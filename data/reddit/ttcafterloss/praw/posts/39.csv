I'm sorry, this is my first time posting.

We were having another little girl, unfortunately that was the same time we found out we had lost the baby.  I had already known this pain all too well, but not to this extent.  I have had two previous miscarriages, but they were earlier on in the pregnancy.  This pain feels like it's too much sometimes, the events of that time are on repeat in my mind and most days I can't shake it.  

I feel guilty for this, because I still have a family to help take care of, and needless to say I am not functioning at my normal level.

As a sort of therapy for myself I've started telling a small piece of the story from the beginning each week in my blog at http://our-pale-days.blogspot.co.uk/ I also have an instagram @our.pale.days.

I went to my OB after the first CP but didn't after my most recent one because I figured there wasn't a point since it was so early and the bleeding has progressed like a normal period.

For various reasons I am considering changing OBs.  One of the main reasons came from a post I made after the visit to my OB after my first CP where she said I should wait until CD15 to have sex, and that my husband should avoid ejaculating at all in the intervening time period so that he can save his sperm.  The response was a resounding, ""Your OB doesn't know what she's talking about, find another one.""  Which certainly alarmed me, but other comments also pointed out that most OBs don't know much about fertility and are really there to help after a woman gets pregnant.

The other reason for switching is that after getting married last year, I moved in with my husband who lives at the other side of the city from my current OB, making it a 1.5 hour journey each way to see her.  But since I knew we would be moving again this summer, I decided to hold off since I don't know where we'll end up.  Well, the move date is approaching so I'll likely be shopping for a new OB soon.

Aside from one instance of a yeast infection 2 years ago which was treated, all other tests done through the OB have come back normal.

It is not specifically about pregnancy loss, but on everything we love and lose in life: possessions, people, memories. 

No triggers specifically for pregnancy, but the essay is primarily about the writer's loss of her father. 

Here is the most relevant quote, if you don't have time to read the whole thing, which is long:

'Entropy, mortality, extinction: the entire plan of the universe consists of losing, and life amounts to a reverse savings account in which we are eventually robbed of everything. Our dreams and plans and jobs and knees and backs and memories, the childhood friend, the husband of fifty years, the father of forever, the keys to the house, the keys to the car, the keys to the kingdom, the kingdom itself: sooner or later, all of it drifts into the Valley of Lost Things.

There’s precious little solace for this, and zero redress; we will lose everything we love in the end. But why should that matter so much? By definition, we do not live in the end: we live all along the way. The smitten lovers who marvel every day at the miracle of having met each other are right; it is finding that is astonishing. You meet a stranger passing through your town and know within days you will marry her. You lose your job at fifty-five and shock yourself by finding a new calling ten years later. You have a thought and find the words. You face a crisis and find your courage.

All of this is made more precious, not less, by its impermanence. No matter what goes missing, the wallet or the father, the lessons are the same. Disappearance reminds us to notice, transience to cherish, fragility to defend. Loss is a kind of external conscience, urging us to make better use of our finite days. As Whitman knew, our brief crossing is best spent attending to all that we see: honoring what we find noble, denouncing what we cannot abide, recognizing that we are inseparably connected to all of it, including what is not yet upon us, including what is already gone. We are here to keep watch, not to keep.'

First of all I want to say how unbelievably sorry I am for any and all here in this sub.  I'm so glad there is a space for us, but so sad at the same time. So many conflicting emotions going on in my brain.

I just experienced a miscarriage this past week while moving across the country- it sucked (to say the least).

My husband and I have been trying since July, after a suspected chemical in June when I went off birth control and got a super faint positive before getting my period.

This time was different, I had three different brands of hpt, even a digital, all confirming that yes we were actually pregnant. Needless to say we were over the moon. We told my mom, my husbands mom, and two very close friends. Every time we told someone we said ""we know it's super early so anything could happen"" but it really didn't prepare me even though I was super cautious with my excitement. UGH. Then, on the night before we left for our 3000 mile car ride I wiped and found bright red blood.  I took an hpt the next day when we got to our first destination- still pregnant.. remained optimistic.  The next day though, I bled heavily with terrible cramps. I suspected I was losing the pregnancy but we stayed optimistic because I was still having so many symptoms. Fast forward to this morning- negative hpt- went to the er because of pain and they confirmed a completed miscarriage.  I was almost six weeks. I'm so sad and disappointed.. and angry. 

My main issue I'm dealing with right now is feeling really guilty about telling the people we told and having to be the barer of bad news.  I have OCD, so this whole thing has made my brain turn in on itself in terms of my anxiety and guilt feelings that come with it and are usually under control (thanks to Wellbutrin).

My heart is broken for all of us here.  Thank you so much for being here- I'm not sure how I would cope otherwise.

It's been 11 weeks since we lost our daughter. My due date was a few days ago. It was a very emotional day and hit us very hard. I had to get outside of the house and do something.

This was my first time back since she died. We released a balloon and wrote Natalie's name in the sand. We went out for a nice dinner but my mind was in a daze. I spent the rest of the night crying. 

The last few days have been tough. Life after her date date is messing me up. I keep thinking that she should be here with us. My heart sinks looking at calendar everyday. She should be alive and in my arms. I keep picturing how things should be. I visualize giving birth and holding my baby girl with my husband. I think about my family and friends meeting her. I picture putting her in the car seat and bringing her home.These moments will never happen. I can't help thinking about how different life should be. I hate being in this new timeline.

Background: I removed my Mirena IUD in March 2016. DH and I started NTNP from May. Got my first positive ever in October, at the appointment at 7w&6d there was a gestational sac and yolk sac with no fetal pole. Ten terrible days later it was confirmed to be an anembryonic pregnancy (blighed ovum). Had a D&E (vacuum procedure in the doctors office) at 9w4d. Three days after my procedure, I went on a solo trip, this helped clear my mind and kept me away form the christmas revelers. 
 
We were NTNP after the first miscarriage and to our surprise managed to conceive on the first cycle. This time, we wanted a late ultrasound so that we would not be in limbo again. The 10w ultrasound found  a gestational sack and yolk sac and no fetal pole.. deja vu. today at 11w I went in for a D&E. My manager at went through the same process with his wife. He asked me to take as much time as I need. I am lucky to get the day off and recover, make a reddit account and join this group.  

I am currently tired, mentally and physically of being in first trimester the past 5-6 months. I am numb from all the sadness. DH is very loving and supportive, he is keeping me sane. Our plan is to prevent for a few months and run some basic tests. 

I found this sub to be of great help after my 1st miscarriage and was following your 30 day challenge of reading books and running. You all are such a great support system. You give me hope. Thank you and I wish we all get our take home babies.

44,2048,confidence,<praw.reddit.Reddit object at 0x7f12a630cd90>,,ttcafterloss,"I never thought I would be here... at all. My husband and I never planned on having a baby, and we certainly never planned to lose it. We thought parenting wasn't for us and not a life we wanted. But life changes, and when, at the age of 38, my husband decided he wanted to try, I thought, ok, why not? We've been together 20 years. We could make room for someone new. Hell, if we get pregnant and we miscarry, no big deal, it happens to lots of women. We will just pick up and move on. It's better to try than wonder. 

We got pregnant the month after I went off the pill, and I went through a host of emotions ranging from panic and anxiety to acceptance and joy. (It took a while!) We had all the tests done. We found out we were having a little girl. And at our twelve week appointment, all excited to hear the heartbeat, we learned we had lost the baby at 7w3d and I had been carrying around an embryo that had stopped living for five weeks without knowing it. I still cry when I think about it and felt like I needed to reflect on the positive things this miscarriage has brought to my life... even though they seem small in comparison to the loss I felt.

Here's what I learned.
----------------------------------
I know what heartbreak is. 
I had lost people in my life that mattered. I had cried and grieved. But at that ""let's just check"" ultrasound, when I saw the tiny little embryo without a beating heart, I literally felt something break inside of me. The hysterical sobbing and complete breakdown at the doctor's office was NOTHING compared to what I would go through when I got home and the reality set in. (What to do with the Doppler? The maternity clothes? The subscriptions to newsfeeds? The maternity pillow? Answer - have husband hide them before I burn them all!)

A miscarriage isn't ""no big deal"".
The level of depression and grief I felt after my loss was profound. I instantly kicked myself for what may have come across as nonchalant responses to my friends who had suffered the same disappointment. I couldn't believe how callous or unprepared I was to support them. I can do so much better now for the other women in my life.

I have learned sensitivity and empathy.
I certainly wouldn't announce to anyone now how ""easy"" it was to get pregnant. Or talk incessantly about my pregnancy in mixed company. I'm now all too aware of how common miscarriage is, how hard women have suffered to get pregnant and stay pregnant, and now I know how much seeing another pregnant woman can hurt to the core. 

I know what NOT to say.
I know not to tell a woman who has miscarried that ""miscarriage is so common, you should have expected this"" or that ""it happened for a reason"" or ""nature was just taking care of a mistake"" or ""at least you got pregnant at all"". I know not to tell a woman that ""everything will be ok"" or ""you'll get pregnant again"" because that just isn't true for everyone. Now I know to say how sorry I am, listen, and offer whatever support my friends want to have. Everyone is different. But no one wants to hear any of the statements above.

I should listen to my body and trust my instincts.
When the intense nausea dropped off at the 8th week but the other symptoms remained, I listened to my doctor when they said the B6 was working. I listened to my husband when he said i was being anxious and everything was fine. I listened to everyone except me... I felt like something was wrong but we had seen the heartbeat a few days before so I felt like I was crazy for feeling anxiety. I wasn't crazy. I should have spoken up for myself and demanded a reassurance scan. It might have saved me the additional five weeks of growing excitement for a pregnancy that wasn't viable. 

I am capable of change.
I was so worried I would make a lousy mom. I was so worried I could never see a future with a baby. The instant I learned I was pregnant, my mind shifted. I started putting someone else ahead of myself. I had a tiny taste of what being a mother might be like... to always put someone else's needs ahead of my own even though we hadn't met. It's also amazing to me how quickly I reverted back to my old habits and frame of mind after the loss... the human mind is an adaptable thing.

I have experienced a true miracle.
I didn't realize how hard it is to get pregnant and stay pregnant. I didn't know what an absolute miracle it is to have everything work out at exactly the right moment. For all cells to be in the right place at the exact right time. To make it through that first four weeks. I didn't realize that every pregnancy, no matter how short, was a miracle in that it ever happened at all. I don't see miracles in the every day but I now see pregnancy as just that - a moment of magic and timing. I'll always have that, whether or not I ever get pregnant again.

I have no control.
I don't know what happens next. Sure, we're trying again but nothing has happened and frankly, just getting my cycle back to normal after the D&C is taking months and months. There is less joy in me this time around as I know what can happen and that bad things can indeed happen to me. But I do know now that it wasn't my fault. That what happened happened. I can't stop it from happening again. But I can take a leap of faith and give it another go.

Miscarriage shouldn't be a secret or a shame.
The number of women who reached out after my mc astounded me and gave me great comfort. It felt good to be supported and know that I wasn't alone. We had told half the universe when we found out we were having a girl at 11 weeks thinking we were safe and literally had to make some terrible phone calls two days later. But the community of women who held me and carried me through (including this group of women) was unbelievable.

Sorry for the ramble. I just needed to get some positive things out there because most days I don't feel positive at all and I think the first pregnancy was a fluke and it will never happen again. If it doesn't, I think I'll be ok because I know so much more than I did before. But July 21st will always hurt (due date). I will always look at pregnant woman and families with a little hurt now. I'm hopeful that the things I've learned will carry me through. Thanks for letting me vent.

I started having some bleeding a week after that appointment and have had some kind of bleeding (from very light to very heavy) ever since. It&#39;s been almost two full weeks since it started and I wanted to know how long it normally lasts? I&#39;m wondering if I need to call them back and get checked out or if this is normal. Also, since I track my cycle, should I chart all the bleeding days? Will it mess up the algorithms? I never really did bbt charting, only CM and occasionally opks, so I&#39;m hoping it doesn&#39;t mess things up too much to where I might miss prime days when we start trying again. This is the first time I&#39;ve had a miscarriage(?) so not really sure how to proceed from here. </p>

I finally became pregnant with my daughter after doing IVF. We were nervous but the weeks passed by. We survived the first trimester and she looked great at the 20 week anatomy ultrasound. My husband and I knew it would be a girl. We were so happy! My pregnancy was textbook and baby was doing fine. 

My 28 week appointment was routine and we heard the heartbeat. I had an anterior placenta which made it difficult to feel movement. I was told this was normal and that kicks would feel softer than usual. My placenta was in the front and provided more cushioning. I didn't feel much movement days later. We heard her heartbeat recently and assumed everything was fine. Was she was having a lazy day? Did she just kick? I'm not too sure...it always felt so faint. I convinced myself that things were fine. She was probably moving and I couldn't feel it. 

I eventually decided to get checked out. It was too late. There was no heartbeat. I didn't think this could happen. I thought we were in the clear. My heart and soul shattered into a million pieces. This was 10 weeks ago. We named her Natalie. I still feel guilt and shame for not going in sooner. She had died and I didn't know. What kind of mother am I? She was the most important thing in my world and I couldn't save her. I was responsible for her and I failed. They told me there was nothing I could have done to change the outcome. Why can't I believe them? I feel broken beyond repair and am having a difficult time wrapping my head around it all. 

We're still waiting on the final autopsy report. I've been warned that we may never have an answer. My OB/GYN thinks we're going to fall into the unexplained category. I tested negative for infection and clotting disorders. The preliminary autopsy report revealed her DNA was normal and her growth was on track. MFM thinks it was a cord accident based on what we know now. (That she moved into a bad position and cut off her supply, etc) A freak accident that shouldn't have happened. We ruled so many different things out. The placenta results are a huge piece of the puzzle that we don't have now. He made it sound like it ultimately comes down to the cord or placental issues. The final report takes anywhere from 12-16 weeks. I don't know what to think anymore. I just wish I had proof of what happened but I feel like I'll never know for sure. 

I miss her so much and never imagined living my life without her. I feel so lost without her. Her due date is next week and I don't know how I'm going to get through it. I keep thinking she should be here. Why is she denied her place on earth? I cry thinking about the person she would have been. I'm devastated...

76,2048,confidence,<praw.reddit.Reddit object at 0x7f12a630cd90>,,ttcafterloss,"I'm curious to hear everyone's thoughts and possible remedies on this issue. Let me start out by saying that I came off the pill at the end of May 2016; we started TTC in July. After coming off the pill, I would get 5-6 days of preperiod spotting (maybe some mild bleeding) and then get a period of 3-5 days. Although initially long, my cycles quickly normalized to 29-30 days despite this spotting. We got pregnant in October on our 4th cycle and miscarried in December at 9 weeks (baby stopped growing at 6 weeks and no heartbeat). After the miscarriage, my period came back at 5 weeks, and my cycles are now 30-31 days, which is fine. Except I still have this almost week of preperiod spotting. My periods are moderately heavy the first 2 days then lighter. I'm 32 now, I was on the pill for 9 years, and before that my periods were always normal. 
I'm actually an endocrinologist myself (peds tho so a little removed from the repro field) and I'm pretty convinced that I may have a progesterone issue, or at least would like to get it checked out because I think this spotting occurs at exactly the time implantation should be and may be interfering with that process. My obgyn suggested an ultrasound to check thickness; he doesn't seem too keen on labs so I will probably get those myself. He says progesterone supplementation is controversial, and he only recommends that we try for another 3 months before we see a fertility specialist. I did have an ultrasound last year to see if polyps could be causing the spotting, and nothing; also that was the first day of my period and my thickness was 5.1 mm. Even if I build up a good lining, I'm starting to shed it at the time when I most need it! 
I'm just so frustrated because we keep trying, and I see there's signs of a potential problem that could be fixed! And I feel like he's just not listening to me and using the old ""try for a year and then we'll see"". Anybody have a similar experience and what did you do? I started looking into natural ways to build up and stabilize lining and ordered vitamin B complex, vitamin E, and raspberry leaf tea. I looked into vitex, but it actually affects hormonal actions by working on the pituitary gland, and that makes me nervous. Also, it seems to work wonders for most but terribly for some. 
Thanks in advance. 

Update: I started all the supplements (B6, E, C, raspberry leaf tea, pomegranate juice, zinc, magnesium, arginine) and am about to start bromelain for 5 days after my pos OPK. Interestingly I ran into one of our repro endos at the hospital and told her my story and she told me I should start progesterone! She said my story sounded pretty compelling for low prog, and it won't hurt to treat. So I'm starting tmrw for 2 weeks bc I had a pos OPK on Thursday. Completely bypassing my obgyn's advice but reading all of your stories and advice made me want to advocate for myself. I can't keep trying for a few more months if I could help fix a problem that I'm seeing symptoms of and understand now. Thank you for all your advice! Keeping my fingers crossed.

Anyway, I was supposed to have the first grandson, but we just found out shortly after Raff's birth that, of course, she's having a boy. I am freaking out that I am going to hate her and this baby simply because it's going to be a constant reminder of what Raff was supposed to be.

I don't have anything against this SIL, but I can't stand the thought of a baby boy being around at the holidays or family gatherings when it isn't Raff. Plus, he was supposed to be in the middle of the two babies. I can't even look at my other SIL's daughter anymore. I'm terrified that everyone will think I can just be happy about these babies and hold them and say, ""Awww how cute that your baby is alive."" (Obviously joking has become a coping method.) 

I don't know how I'm going to avoid all the gatherings and holidays, or even if I should. I could barely contain my tears the last time I saw them all. We go to the same church, and so far I have run out of every service so no one will see me cry. I'm irrationally scared of bumping into someone I know and seeing their baby and them asking if I want to hold it.  Good gravy, could there BE more women with babies?? And despite the fact that I don't want everyone to see me cry, I don't want anyone to mistake that for me being ""okay"".

How are we supposed to handle all these confusing emotions and family situations when one (or more for some of us) of the most important people in our lives was just ripped away from us? It's not fair. :/

Everyone likes to label my son's stillbirth as a ""fluke."" This is because my entire pregnancy until his sudden death at term, I had no issues--no high blood pressure, no blood sugar, no indication something would go wrong. So it's ""just one of those things"" which I don't really believe, because there has to be something that happened to cause his death, it doesn't make rational sense. So I started to think about my mom and her difficult pregnancies. 

My mom suffered with preeclampsia all three of her pregnancies with us, but with an amazing amount of luck and good care from doctors we all survived. Her preeclampsia was so bad that her doctor suggested she stop having kids after her third daughter because she could die. I was her first child, she ended up having me at 7 months as an emergency c section because her blood pressure shot up, I was born at one pound and one ounce, and she basically lived in the NICU with me for months. I grew up to be normal, healthy and happy. Two years later she got a high risk OB and carried my sister to 36 weeks before another emergency c section, and seven years after that had a surprise pregnancy with my youngest sister which was another emergency section at 7 months. 

Sorry I'm rambling but I always thought my mom had these issues because she was a smoker all her life, even while pregnant, so I glided carefree through my pregnancy while my mom was extremely paranoid for me the whole time because of her traumatic experiences. I did tell my OB a couple times my mom had preeclampsia but they all brushed it off. Then my son died. After, I asked the MFM I met if preeclampsia was genetic--she told me YES, it is. She then checked all my files immediately and became really intrigued by this, but my blood pressure was fine after labor. Anyway I'm thinking there's some kind of tie--did I suddenly get random preeclampsia out of nowhere, did my blood pressure shoot up for a few horrible hours and take my son's life, then go back down?

I know genetically there may be some things...like MTHFR, which I have, and I'm thinking my mom has. Or maybe we both have another mild clotting disorder. Who knows. It just seems like too much of a coincidence between my mom and I, and despite my blood pressure being ""perfect,"" I was horribly swollen towards the end and I always wonder if this was why.

Ok I guess I'm really just rambling now. But at least my MFM took me seriously, even though it was too late :( and my OB didn't while I was actually pregnant. I feel like I should have insisted more that my mom had issues and I should be treated as high risk, but with great vitals all the time and the belief I had that she was a smoker, so that caused her problems, how could I have known?

I got pregnant on the birth control mini pill, and though it was a surprise it was so wanted and welcomed. We found out the 14th. I had a confirmation test done the 15th and started bleeding on the 20th. 
I spent 5 hours in the er waiting for answers and all they could tell me was I was threatening miscarriage but my cervix was closed and to follow up with my ob doctor within the next few days for a repeat on my hgc levels. 
I went the 22nd, still bleeding and cramping horribly and had more labs drawn, and my numbers were not changing at all, so I had to go back the 24th (an extremely emotional two days later.) my numbers were going up! Still not normally but it gave me some hope. They called me back and I made the one hour trip back to the hospital for an emergency ultrasound because they thought I was having an ectopic pregnancy.
I have never been so scared as I was during that ultrasound and I just knew I wasn't going to see anything but to my utter surprise I seen our little baby with a heartbeat of 105, and I'll never forget the look on my fiancé's face when he realized we were ok. 
I had a follow up appointment the 7th, for another ultrasound and routine visit..but the 25th at 7:00 pm I started bleeding heavy and my cramps increased. I got a shower a little but later and when I got out I set down to see how much I was still bleeding. *graphic* I wiped and it felt weird so I looked down and seen something poking about a half an inch out of my vagina so I grabbed it with a baby wipe and pulled. 
It was my placenta. I text my fiancé at exactly 8:00 and asked him to come to the bathroom and see. 
We waited out the next day because we both just knew, and didn't see the point in going to the er. 
This morning I went for an ultrasound with no heartbeat. It was an incomplete miscarriage and I'm currently waiting on the pills to be filled to help my body along because I didn't want the surgery. 
My baby died 24 hours after I seen it's beautiful little heartbeat. I feel so lost right now. 
I just wanted to get my story out and vent some as I've not even really Registered what's happened yet I don't think. I feel like I'm dreaming.

He was born at 23 weeks 5 days and he weighed 1.6 lbs and measured 31 cm. Unfortunately, he was too small to make it and he passed on the morning of the 19th. (You can look in my post history for more information). It's been a week now since we lost him and it still doesn't feel like it's sunk in. I've hardly accepted that I even birthed him; that he's not inside of me anymore.

People keep asking me how I'm doing, and I honestly don't know. I feel lost. The things I used to enjoy just seem meaningless and I don't know how to explain what's going on or what happened. I'm 20 and my boyfriend is 22, and no one has been able to give us any sort of reason as to why this happened to us. We found out we were expecting on November 4th, but none of our family/friends knew that we had been trying. We were scared, but we were so excited and so happy to have been given the opportunity. I went to every appointment, I bought prenatal vitamins the day I found out, we did everything we could. But still we didn't get to take him home. 

Now we're faced with trying again and even though we both know that we want children and we both know that we're ready, I'm so scared of what might happen and I know he is too. I think of terms like DPO and BFP/BFN and I thought they were behind me. I didn't think I would need to feel this way again, this hoping and praying and charting. And then they tell us to wait, and I just don't think it's fair. We waited 3 months to find out, and another 4 for him to come - we shouldn't have to wait any longer. I'm just so frustrated that I don't know what to do, and I feel so alone in my struggles that I don't know who to turn to.

I've read a lot of your stories and I think it would help me to share my own. I experienced my miscarriage in August. Actually, I only knew I was pregnant for 6 days before it happened. It was my first pregnancy, and unplanned. My boyfriend and I had only been dating for a few months, but things felt right. Within those 6 days, I had wrapped my head around the fact that I was going to become a mother. We are young, (24/24) and I was afraid, but I've wanted to become a mother all of my life. At first I was so scared, but something clicked inside me, that this was something that I wanted. I didn't even know how bad I wanted it until suddenly it was taken from me. Over the course of a week, I went from deciding that I would leave law school to start our family together, to having to flip off that switch just as quickly as I had turned it on when the mc happened. My immediate family and my boyfriend's immediate family already knew. We are states apart attending grad school so it was extremely hard to deal with the loss not being able to be together. At first I didn't know if I should feel some sense of relief, that because it was unplanned and because I was going to have to leave school, if now I should just try and forget about it and continue with my plans. Needless to say, I've continued with my plans, but now we feel like that opened up a door that can never be shut, now. I never knew how badly I wanted to have a baby and start a family until I was denied that opportunity. I know my boyfriend is the one, and starting a family is extremely important to him, as well. But I am so. Scared. To even attempt again. I'm young and healthy, I've been an athlete my entire life. I don't do drugs. I drink occasionally. I've never been told that I would struggle to get pregnant. But I lost my first pregnancy. I never imagined that that would ever happen to me in a million years. I remember thinking, wow, this actually was unplanned, I wonder why it was so easy. And I had spoken way too soon. I haven't stopped wanting a baby since then. I can't emphasize enough how much I did NOT know I wanted, needed this in my life, until I couldn't have it anymore. It's all I see on Facebook, on tv, at the grocery store, etc. Babies everywhere. I know many of you ladies have experienced the same feelings. I'm jealous. My heart is still broken, I will never forget those 6 days where I laid in bed realizing that I wasn't alone. That there was a second person there. It's like something turned on the moment I saw the positive test, and I can't turn it off again no matter how hard I try. But I am so afraid to try again because I never want to feel as helpless and sad as I did/do after the loss. I know positivity is key, and I'm trying not to consider all the negative outcomes that could happen. I'm just afraid. Apologies for this post being so long, I just don't talk about it much at all and feel like this community is one that will understand.

Reading about the experiences of others helped me in the early days following my loss. I lost my baby boy Luka at 20 weeks in December 2016.

I had a pretty uneventful pregnancy - I felt pretty good, apart from being extremely tired. It was a planned pregnancy and both myself and my partner were extremely excited to be parents. I had an 8 week ultrasound for dating and also paid for the NIPT test for screening plus gender. The NIPT can back with great results and low risk for all. We also found out we were having a baby boy. We named him Luka and we were looking forward to being parents. 

I requested a 13 week ultrasound just to check up on the little guy. The sonographer claimed all was fine - little Luka was quite active and I left this appointment feeling joyful, unaware of what was to come. I booked my 20 week ultrasound at another clinic and went on with my life unaware that my little boy was unwell. 

Fast forward to my 20 week ultrasound. My little boy was kicking like crazy once again and my fiancé looked so happy. The sonographer checked Luka's head and profile, when his whole demeanor changed. He asked me, ""If something was wrong, would you prefer that I tell you?"". My heart sunk whilst I responded, ""yes"". I knew something didn't look right but I didn't know what was happening. He simply said, ""I'm sorry, but something is very wrong - please go to the hospital, I will fax through the report as soon as possible."" He apologised once again as me and my fiancé left to go to the hospital. 

We went back to the car and I broke down crying. I couldn't keep it together, I just cried and cried. I got to the hospital and asked them whether the report had come through from the sonographer. They told me they had not received it yet and I was asked to sit in the waiting room. I was surrounded by pregnant women there for their antenatal appointments. I couldn't handle this, waiting there surrounded by pregnant women whilst I knew something was very wrong with my baby, and eventually I broke down again until a nurse came to console me. I was then quickly seen by the obstetrician/doctor. 

It was then explained to me that my baby had anencephaly. I had never heard of the term before and I was in a state of shock. My fiancé broke out in tears whilst I sat there quietly taking all the information in. She, the doctor, advised it was ""incompatible with life"". My baby had no chance at survival. This was on a Friday and I agreed to be induced a few days later on Sunday. Feeling Luka kick on Friday night and Saturday killed me. I couldn't bear it knowing he would die on Sunday. I was broken. No one knew how this was not picked up at the 13 week ultrasound.

I went in to hospital at noon on Sunday, was induced and Luka was delivered silent before midnight. I didn't hold him as I couldn't bear it. It was too much for me, I couldn't handle it. I don't regret it as I prefer the image I have of him in my mind. I took home a bear donated by another couple who had lost a baby, that is the only physical representation of him I have. Reliving the labor and delivery is hard as I have somehow managed to push it away deep within as it is too upsetting to think about now.

I was discharged the following day. I remember leaving the hospital, hearing crying babies and seeing families celebrating the births of their babies. My and my fiancé left feeling empty without our baby. I knew he was not well and I do not regret our decision, but this was the hardest thing I've ever experienced.

I've had follow up appointments with clinical genetics which advised they did not know the cause, it was nothing I had or had not done. We are both healthy and young (myself 25 and my fiancé 24) with no history in the family of such abnormalities. This was a planned pregnancy so I was taking a prenatal with folic acid for months prior to conceiving. I've come to accept there are no answers. Doctors have advised me to take 5mg of folic acid (a large dose) when trying to conceive next to try lower the risk of another NTD, but I don't know whether I want to try again. 

My fiancé and I took turns crying in the early days after losing Luka. I would break down and he would comfort me, then he would break down and I would comfort him. It is all a blur now, but sometimes I find myself crying myself to sleep even months later. I avoided all friends and family for as long as I could as I couldn't cope explaining what had happened.
