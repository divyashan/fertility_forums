Background: totally unexplained since I got my cycle back in 2016 after a year of post pill amenorrhea. This was my first pregnancy. 

We learned it was a girl which I felt like I knew in my heart the whole time, but she had Triploidy 70 and lab wasn’t able to discern whether it was Diandric (sperm) or Digynic (egg). Triploidy 69, XXX/XXY/XYY includes 3 copies of every chromosome and is represented in <10% of all clinical losses or 1:1000 chance. She had an extra X chromosome on top of that. I had a hard time finding many mentions of triploidy in general on here. The other things I learned (I think I read every research study mentioning it) are that it’s not related to maternal age in the same way Trisomy is. Also that a version with 70 is EXTREMELY rare, and not even really google-able, so like <1:1000000. Of the largest triploidy study to date, with like 500+ cases, only one case had 70 chromosomes. 

My OB said due to the rarity and our history she definitely recommends Karyotyping and probably straight to IVF with PGS/PGD. Haven’t spoken to my RE yet. The only other weird genetic thing I know I have is Homozygous MTHFR C677T which is often implicated in higher chance for losses but euploid ones. 

Would love to hear from any others on this board who found out triploidy was the reason behind loss, please DM or reply. Given our history of this being our only pregnancy in over 3 years (and I’ve been trying to avoid IVF but seems like all roads lead there, I turned 37 today) this just feels weird.

11,2048,confidence,<praw.reddit.Reddit object at 0x7f12a630cd90>,,ttcafterloss,"On Tuesday my wife was having back pain all day. I came home after work with the intention of going back to work. When I got home she was having immobilizing back pain so I took her to the hospital. 

Once we got there they whisked her back while leaving me in the waiting room alone. By the time I was allowed back they had her disrobed and in the pelvic exam position. They went to start checking and her water broke. At 7:05 our boy Lucas was born with his placenta. At this point we frantically asked about our girl twin and they did an ultrasound and she seemed to be ok. 

About 15 minutes after Lucas was born her water broke again before they could do anything. Lily Anna was born shortly after without her placenta.

We got to hold them and Lucas survived around an hour before he passed and she only survived around 45 minutes. They tried so hard to live and it was heartbreaking watching them gasped for air. 

That night they gave her meds to try and pass the placenta but by Wednesday it still hadn't passed. Around noon they made the decision to give her an epidural and do a d&c to remove everything. During this time I made the painful calls to find the best funeral home for the cremation. 

The hospital wrapped the babies in their own blankets and kept them in the room with us so we could mourn them and allow our visitors the chance to say goodbye. They also provided a nonprofit professional photographer to take photos of them and us with them. It was so painful doing those photos but I know we will appreciate them later.

We ended up staying the night again and we made our final goodbye today right before they transferred them to the funeral home.

I came home after work with the intention of going back to work. When I got home she was having immobilizing back pain so I took her to the hospital. </p>

<p>Once we got there they whisked her back while leaving me in the waiting room alone. By the time I was allowed back they had her disrobed and in the pelvic exam position. They went to start checking and her water broke. At 7:05 our boy Lucas was born with his placenta. At this point we frantically asked about our girl twin and they did an ultrasound and she seemed to be ok. </p>

<p>About 15 minutes after Lucas was born her water broke again before they could do anything. Lily Anna was born shortly after without her placenta.</p>

<p>We got to hold them and Lucas survived around an hour before he passed and she only survived around 45 minutes. They tried so hard to live and it was heartbreaking watching them gasped for air. </p>

<p>That night they gave her meds to try and pass the placenta but by Wednesday it still hadn&#39;t passed. Around noon they made the decision to give her an epidural and do a d&amp;c to remove everything. During this time I made the painful calls to find the best funeral home for the cremation. </p>

<p>The hospital wrapped the babies in their own blankets and kept them in the room with us so we could mourn them and allow our visitors the chance to say goodbye. They also provided a nonprofit professional photographer to take photos of them and us with them. It was so painful doing those photos but I know we will appreciate them later.</p>

<p>We ended up staying the night again and we made our final goodbye today right before they transferred them to the funeral home.</p>

Three weeks ago I went to the hospital for bleeding. Turns out I had a partial placenta abruption with a very large blood clot. My doctors were hopeful, saying everything should be okay as long as we monitor closely. 

Fast forward to last week, I went to the hospital for intensely painful cramping. Apparently my body tried to get rid of the clot by going into early labor. Additionally, my sac had dropped, leaving my baby with little to no amniotic fluid. Doctor came in to tell us and we were shocked to say the least. She gave us our two options:

1) Wait it out to see what happens. They said that there was no way to tell how long I would continue laboring or if my sac would recede. Doctors guessed that I wouldn’t last longer than 1 week and even if I made it to 24 weeks, baby may have lung issues due to the lack of amniotic fluid around her. Not to mention the slew of other issues that come with premature birth. 

Or 

2) Break my water and induce labor.

I decided on option 2. At the time I was confident that my choice was the best one. And I’m not beating myself up or anything but I’m starting to wonder what if. What if I had waited. Sure it would have been super uncomfortable and I would have spent at least an extra week or more in the hospital but what if the doctors were wrong and she did make it.

I found out today (8-ish weeks) I had a MMC (stopped developing mid-5). I kind of knew this was coming - slow rising HCG, intermittent bleeding that at two points seemed like a miscarriage but were diagnosed as threatened miscarriages. No bleeding and minimal cramping since a mid-5 week scan showed a normal gestational sac, though, and my HCG kept going up. So while I knew today’s scan was most likely to confirm the loss, a few weeks of feeling normal-pregnant and I accidentally let myself get my hopes up. I have a consult tomorrow for a D&C...I just want this to be over so I can grieve completely after weeks of limbo and hopefully get back to trying ASAP. This makes two MC for me but the first was 6 years ago while I was on nuvaring and with a violently abusive ex, so it doesn’t feel like part of my story in the same way but of course does make me worry this is somehow a pattern. We actually got pregnant on the first full cycle off my IUD which felt like a freaking miracle - I have endometriosis and lupus, and was born with a neural tube defect myself (tethered cord, resulting in two cord surgeries and some disability). We had months of preparation for TTC with MFM and high risk OB consults, genetic testing, etc. I didn’t expect “the plan” to work out so quickly — or so poorly. Anyway, enough of my moping.

No bleeding and minimal cramping since a mid-5 week scan showed a normal gestational sac, though, and my HCG kept going up. So while I knew today’s scan was most likely to confirm the loss, a few weeks of feeling normal-pregnant and I accidentally let myself get my hopes up. I have a consult tomorrow for a D&amp;C...I just want this to be over so I can grieve completely after weeks of limbo and hopefully get back to trying ASAP. This makes two MC for me but the first was 6 years ago while I was on nuvaring and with a violently abusive ex, so it doesn’t feel like part of my story in the same way but of course does make me worry this is somehow a pattern. We actually got pregnant on the first full cycle off my IUD which felt like a freaking miracle - I have endometriosis and lupus, and was born with a neural tube defect myself (tethered cord, resulting in two cord surgeries and some disability). We had months of preparation for TTC with MFM and high risk OB consults, genetic testing, etc. I didn’t expect “the plan” to work out so quickly — or so poorly. Anyway, enough of my moping. Hoping the consult goes well tomorrow and the D&amp;C can be scheduled quickly!! Glad to have found you all here.</p>

About 10 days ago I found out I'd had a missed miscarriage. On Thursday morning I consulted with my OB and we decided to go ahead with a D&C. Thursday at 6pm, I had the D&C under general anesthesia.

I can’t tell if I’m being impatient or not. I’ve had a previous pregnancy that resulted in a living child. We tried for #2 and got pregnant on the 3rd cycle. That pregnancy ended in a MMC at 9+5. I ovulated two weeks after my DNC but didn’t conceive. The next month I had a CP. It’s been another 3 months with no positive HPTs. I’m feeling like if I’m not pregnant this cycle I should contact my OBGYN to ask for testing, although I’m not sure what to ask for specifically. 

I’m about to turn 33 in a few months and technically we’ve been trying for 9 months since trying for #2 and I’ve had 2 losses, although I didn’t receive medical attention for the CP. When they ask how long we’ve been trying is it since the MC or since the start? 

I’m in the US and I’m worried they’re going to tell me to relax and give it more time. Am I being too impatient or does this seem like cause for additional testing? Perhaps there’s an issue staying pregnant? Perhaps there’s been some scarring from the DNC? Perhaps I’ve developed polyps or something since baby #1?

At 8 weeks, baby was gone. Still measured 6 weeks, and one day smaller than before. No heartbeat. I stopped taking my progesterone supplements so my body could let go.

My endocrinologist (who was doing all my care) scheduled a follow-up ultrasound just to be sure. 4 days later, nothing had changed. I started bleeding the day before the last ultrasound, but nothing substantial. 

I wasn't sure if letting nature take it's course was the best thing or not. But after a few days of unproductive and very painful cramping with very little blood (less than day 1 of a period for me), I opted to take the Misoprostol that my doctor had prescribed me. The way her nurses described it to me was that nothing was happening because my cervix was still closed, and the misoprostol would open it. 

I realized that I couldn't deal with not knowing when and if things would ever move along, and I didn't want to wait painfully in bed for weeks. I had called this week off work, so now was as good of a time as any. 

I felt like having the medicine gave me some measure of control over this awful process, so it could happen on my terms. I'm really grateful for that.

So on Thursday, after a morning obligation, I asked my husband to come home from work to be with me. I took the medicine at around 3:30, four pills inserted vaginally. 

The doctor had also prescribed me Vicodin for the pain (thank you!) since I'm allergic to Advil. 

I stayed in bed for a few hours. Cramping slowly ramped up, and got quite painful despite the Vicodin around four hours after I took the pills. 

I was still only spotting minor blood for most of the time. 

At one point, I went to the bathroom and thought I had passed the sac, since there was something white and round in the toilet. But there wasn't any other blood or tissue, so I realized it was just a pill falling out. 

About half an hour later, the floodgates opened. After half an hour of really severe cramping, I sat on the toilet and a ton of blood and tissue fell out. Over the next hour or two, this happened a few more times (each time with less tissue). 

Since then, I've had minimal bleeding again, and almost no tissue. It's like a light period with the cramping of a bad one. I occasionally take a Vicodin if the cramps are too bad, but don't really like it. Apparently Vicodin makes it hard to urinate, which is a pain in the ass. 

I'm feeling human again, though weak and tired. I feel well enough to go back to work on Monday (took the meds on Thursday afternoon). I could probably have gone back a few days earlier, but it's nice to have that time off to relax and recover mentally also. 

Now I just have to schedule my blood draws to ensure my levels keep dropping appropriately. Not sure if I'll get my period four weeks from now, or four weeks from HCG hitting zero (advice is welcome!)

Editing to add:

I’m out of surgery and everything went great. Went under a general and it was easy, coming out of anesthesia was fine, and now just waiting in recovery to be discharged in an hour or two.

How terrible is IVF? Money aside, is it worth it to hedge our bets? Can you talk about the mental/emotional/physical toll? Even if you haven’t done IVF, would/have you consider/considered it?

Background:

I TFMR about a year and a half ago, 9 months later I was hospitalized for a month after a large pelvic abscess caused sepsis and peritonitis. Also relevant: one of my Fallopian tubes is pretty battered - i get cysts and have had two removed laparoscopically in association with cyst-caused torsions.

I didn’t have issues conceiving or carrying my daughter (incompatible with life diagnosis), but my doctor referred us to a fertility specialist after the whole debacle because apparently I’m now at increased risk for future infection and ectopic pregnancy. 

That specialist is recommending IVF

Obviously I don’t want to end up with another infection and an ectopic would be extremely traumatic (plus any procedures=opportunity for infection). Specialist says there’s a decent chance we could conceive naturally and without issue... but she doesn’t want to do an HSG to check my tube health (infection  risk).

Then there’s the TFMR layer; I know there’s no guarantee but IVF does offer a little comfort in terms of screening for potential issues.

If we don’t go IVF route doc recommends transvaginal ultrasounds every cycle to determine which side is ovulating. I have a realllly hard time with these emotionally ever since our TFMR. But maybe it’s the better option?

Sorry for the rambling/medical history dump. I know it’s a lot. I’m just pretty confused/torn.

I had a TFMR on March 1st, and finally got my period on the 10th of May. The bleeding stopped yesterday. Today my mood swings are wild, and my breasts are HUGE.

The threatened miscarriage started on Mother’s Day with some light bleeding and a clot. I got in to see my doctor first thing and the ultrasound showed we were still pregnant, but my gestational sac was scalloped. Doctor said there was a chance the pregnancy would go on, but he wasn’t optimistic.

The next few days I had light bleeding and a couple hours of bad cramps, but I was starting to feel more hopeful. It seemed to be lessening and I thought our little one might make it. Then yesterday happened. 

I woke up feeling a little fevery. By the time I got to my doctor’s it was 101.3. Another ultrasound showed the pregnancy hadn’t progressed, but there was still a very very slight chance for a baby. Unfortunately, the fever meant I had a uterine infection and high risk of sepsis which can be fatal. He said the infection was progressing rapidly and recommended a D&C.

My heart sank. Thinking we were having a miscarriage was hard enough, but knowing we had to make the decision to end it was unbearable. Our baby had a very slim chance of making it while there was a good chance I could become gravely ill and do irreparable harm to my uterus or even risk my life if we didn’t. When my fever hit 102.6, I felt more secure in our decision, but it didn’t make it any easier.

I’m sitting in the hospital now after our surgery yesterday. I’ve cried a lot.

Hello, new to this sub so let me know if I didn't post this correctly.  I have a toddler (3 in June). We were lucky to conceive him our first try with no complications during pregnancy.  

I wanted the next baby close after but due to my husband's work we held off. Last summer we decided to try and got pregnant on the second cycle and were really excited.  I always had some caution about the possibility of miscarrying. I started to worry that my symptoms were pretty much non existent compared to my first.  But everyone says ""every pregnancy is different"". At just under 9 weeks I went to the ultrasound by myself (no family around and my toddler was with a sitter). Right away I could tell something was wrong and when she asked about my dates and wanted transvaginal I started crying because I knew. Sure enough baby had stopped growing at 6.5 weeks.  We had a trip out of country planned ten days later so we opted for the d&c.  I  had to wait on call for 3 days to get in (fasting each time). Once I got in we went to the hospital.  During the prep I was holding it together and they told me I'd be recovering on the mom's and babies ward.  I stopped being able to listen and said ""you mean with the new babies"" and she said ""yes I know it's not ideal"" and I just broke down crying and asked they try to find something different.  Luckily they did find another room.  I only spoke to obgyn as I was on surgery table.  Luckily the procedure went well.  

My husband was not very supportive and the next day wanted to leave me with my toddler so he could go to the gym. He never brought up the miscarriages again and wasn't very empathic.  On our trip I was so irritated, angry and anxious.  We ended up getting pregnant a few weeks after d&c and that's when I started realizing I wasn't over the miscarriage and all the ways it was affecting me.  I spent more time crying about the loss than being excited for the pregnancy.  

I was having lots of symptoms but I was still nervous despite lots of hcg blood tests that looked great (stopped them around six weeks). I had an ultrasound booked at 9 weeks but a couple weeks before I started freaking out and having severe anxiety.  My midwife told me to stay positive and at 8 weeks I asked her thoughts on me going to ucbaby to just check for a heart beat.  She suggested I just wait but I booked an appointment a few hours later. I took my toddler in tow and sure enough the lady couldn't find a heartbeat but couldn't tell me the size or any other info.  Now I was really panicking and called my midwife.  I had no childcare and they don't allow kids in ultrasounds so I had to wait four long days to go for an ultrasound.  Once again I immediately knew it wasn't good and they let me know baby stopped growing around six weeks.  

I was floored.  I opted for misoprostal this time. My experience with it was okay.  Went back for a check and needed a second dose (which was much easier than the first). It was about 3 weeks from the first ultrasound to getting the all clear.  

As I was going through this my ten year old dog that I'd had since a puppy became sick.  I was driving her to appointments and it kept worsening.  Eventually found out that we had to say goodbye.  I was crushed,  this was the final straw and I felt so broken.  I couldn't believe everything life was throwing at me.  I was crying constantly and my poor toddler was clearly being affected by everything.  It was hard to balance caring for him and taking time to heal.  The one good thing was that my husband and family felt grief and loss for her with me.  I finally didn't feel so alone.  Neighbors sent cards and flowers,  people messaged and shared memories.  It was an acknowledged loss unlike the miscarriages.  I could share on social media and people could understand.  I began counseling,  journaling,  talking to others,  exercising. Anything I could think might help I tried. 

Eventually I started feeling a little better and even having good days.  Then six weeks after losing my pup my grandfather had an embolism.  He was in the ICU for two weeks before losing him.  It was so challenging being there for family.  I feel like I haven't even fully grieved him because I've just had it with grief and need some denial.

<p>Hello, new to this sub so let me know if I didn&#39;t post this correctly.  I have a toddler (3 in June). We were lucky to conceive him our first try with no complications during pregnancy.  </p>

<p>I wanted the next baby close after but due to my husband&#39;s work we held off. Last summer we decided to try and got pregnant on the second cycle and were really excited.  I always had some caution about the possibility of miscarrying. I started to worry that my symptoms were pretty much non existent compared to my first.  But everyone says &quot;every pregnancy is different&quot;. At just under 9 weeks I went to the ultrasound by myself (no family around and my toddler was with a sitter). Right away I could tell something was wrong and when she asked about my dates and wanted transvaginal I started crying because I knew. Sure enough baby had stopped growing at 6.5 weeks.  We had a trip out of country planned ten days later so we opted for the d&amp;c.  I  had to wait on call for 3 days to get in (fasting each time). Once I got in we went to the hospital.  During the prep I was holding it together and they told me I&#39;d be recovering on the mom&#39;s and babies ward.  I stopped being able to listen and said &quot;you mean with the new babies&quot; and she said &quot;yes I know it&#39;s not ideal&quot; and I just broke down crying and asked they try to find something different.  Luckily they did find another room.  I only spoke to obgyn as I was on surgery table.  Luckily the procedure went well.  </p>

<p>My husband was not very supportive and the next day wanted to leave me with my toddler so he could go to the gym. He never brought up the miscarriages again and wasn&#39;t very empathic.  On our trip I was so irritated, angry and anxious.  We ended up getting pregnant a few weeks after d&amp;c and that&#39;s when I started realizing I wasn&#39;t over the miscarriage and all the ways it was affecting me.  I spent more time crying about the loss than being excited for the pregnancy.  </p>

<p>I was having lots of symptoms but I was still nervous despite lots of hcg blood tests that looked great (stopped them around six weeks). I had an ultrasound booked at 9 weeks but a couple weeks before I started freaking out and having severe anxiety.  My midwife told me to stay positive and at 8 weeks I asked her thoughts on me going to ucbaby to just check for a heart beat.  She suggested I just wait but I booked an appointment a few hours later. I took my toddler in tow and sure enough the lady couldn&#39;t find a heartbeat but couldn&#39;t tell me the size or any other info.  Now I was really panicking and called my midwife.  I had no childcare and they don&#39;t allow kids in ultrasounds so I had to wait four long days to go for an ultrasound.  Once again I immediately knew it wasn&#39;t good and they let me know baby stopped growing around six weeks.  </p>

<p>I was floored.  I opted for misoprostal this time. My experience with it was okay.  Went back for a check and needed a second dose (which was much easier than the first). It was about 3 weeks from the first ultrasound to getting the all clear.  </p>

<p>As I was going through this my ten year old dog that I&#39;d had since a puppy became sick.  I was driving her to appointments and it kept worsening.  Eventually found out that we had to say goodbye.  I was crushed,  this was the final straw and I felt so broken.  I couldn&#39;t believe everything life was throwing at me.  I was crying constantly and my poor toddler was clearly being affected by everything.  It was hard to balance caring for him and taking time to heal.  The one good thing was that my husband and family felt grief and loss for her with me.  I finally didn&#39;t feel so alone.  Neighbors sent cards and flowers,  people messaged and shared memories.  It was an acknowledged loss unlike the miscarriages.  I could share on social media and people could understand.  I began counseling,  journaling,  talking to others,  exercising. Anything I could think might help I tried. </p>

<p>Eventually I started feeling a little better and even having good days.  Then six weeks after losing my pup my grandfather had an embolism.  He was in the ICU for two weeks before losing him.  It was so challenging being there for family.  I feel like I haven&#39;t even fully grieved him because I&#39;ve just had it with grief and need some denial.  </p>

<p>It&#39;s been a few months since the last miscarriage and we&#39;ve decided to try again.  This time we just randomly had unprotected sex but plan to get more serious next cycle if I don&#39;t get pregnant.  </p>

<p>I feel like the joy and excitement of pregnancy has been robbed from me. I&#39;m coming out of the shadows but I&#39;m forever a changed person.  Definitely a more empathic person.</p>

I’ve been lurking for a couple of weeks now and I thought I would introduce myself. I delivered my son (stillborn) at 23 weeks on March 5th. It’s been a really shitty past 6 or so months.

My pregnancy was fine up until 13 weeks, at that point I thought I was having a MC but it was a subchorionic hematoma. They said baby was fine and that it wasn’t a big deal and that women make it to term all the time with them. We monitored but I kept bleeding. At 20 weeks my water officially broke, completely. I was on strict bedrest, doing everything I possibly could but one early morning I went into labor and delivered my son, Silas. They think he passed earlier the day before or something. His weight was great and we would’ve tried to save him/intervene but he was already gone. I always knew that this was a possibility…but it all happened so fast. From my first contraction to giving birth it was a 2 hour span. I ended up taking an ambulance and that ambulance got hit on the way to the hospital. Then I ended up having to have a D&C after giving birth cause my placenta wouldn’t come out. It was a horrible experience. I’ve started going to individual counseling to try to work through some of my feelings and PTSD. It’s hard.

Starting in September we are going to try again and I’m scared shitless. They say it was a fluke and shouldn’t happen again but it doesn’t matter….my anxiety will go through the roof. I’m also scared to give birth because of the pain. Delivering Silas was so freaking painful, it was horrible.

I'm really miserable to be joining this club, but I've heard the support is awesome. 

My story-after 8 months TTC #2 we fell pregnant. I had a bad feeling about the pregnancy from the beginning - my tests were very light for a few days, but eventually picked up. I didn't get a 3+ weeks on the CB digital until I was 6 weeks pregnant. I went into for my first scan at 7+2 on Wednesday, and my fears were confirmed - little bean was measuring 5+5 with a HR of 90. It was a monitored cycle with my OB, so we're 100% sure of my dates.

I go back on Tuesday for another scan. My OB was trying to keep us a bit positive and said that a bean in the right place with a heartbeat isn't the worst news - but I can't see it ending happily. My pregnancy symptoms are all gone (after vomiting and nausea up to 6 weeks) and I suspect the heartbeat will be gone on Tuesday. 

I want to think about my options before I see him on Tuesday so I'm not blindsided. My priority is to get pregnant again ASAP, so if there's no heartbeat, I would like to nudge the miscarriage along rather than wait it out. I have a slight preference for a D&C over pills to avoid the trauma of seeing everything, but I ultimately want to do what will get me fertile again quickest. I've also had a c section and we were worried about scarring before I got pregnant, so I wonder if a D&C might also give my doctor a chance to have a look at that too?

Any advice or tips would be much appreciated. This is so fucking hard - harder than I even imagined.

I recently found this group after I had a loss at 19 weeks because of what doctors suggested was cervical incompetence. I had growing back pains for a couple of days and went to the ER with bleeding and bulging bag. My water broke later that day and we chose to get a DandE done.

The last month so far has been tough. We have net with my ob and mfm both and talked about next steps.  Two out of three doctors we have met so far have advised us to wait an year before trying again, with the mfm mentioning that the cervix would regain strength in this time... while my ob said ""whenever your cycle resets it's fine""

It feels to be such a terribly long wait. It would be great if anyone can share their experience about what timeline they felt was right in terms of trying again after loss, and what steps I need to take to ensure I am healthy before a next attempt.

Sorry for the long rant. I have tried to keep up the strength but it's been hard and each time I think about the wait and anxiety that would ensue in the next pregnancy I just fall once again.

Lots of contraction like cramps and super heavy bleeding for one day, then light spotting for two days, then cramps and bleeding for two more days (worse than period pain and heavier bleeding) followed by heavy spotting for another week. My ultrasound today showed 3 cm of tissue still there so I’m scheduled for a D&C Friday. Anyone with insights into what to expect from a D&C when there isn’t much tissue left? Or the comparison between misoprostol?

UPDATE for anyone going through something similar: had D&C this morning. My understanding is vacuum was primarily used if not exclusively. I was put under rather than the light anesthesia options due to pre-existing unrelated conditions. Prep was just blood pressure, heart rate, temp, etc. I didn’t have a pelvic exam same day before the actual procedure. IV was put in. They gave me something to relax as the wheeled me away to the OR (I didn’t ask for it and didn’t think I needed it but figured it might make their job easier). That hit in about a minute. In the OR they put the mask over my face fairly quickly. I went under at just before noon. Next time I looked it was one. I felt suddenly very awake and aware though they said I had been awake for several minutes by that point. My Dr talked to me but I have zero memory of that, then talked to my husband to tell him everything was fine and that I was very inquisitive (this makes sense-I ask many specific questions always- it cracked me up) then she came back to talk to me again. I’m sure I asked all the same questions of her again lol. 

In the recovery room, I still had an IV in. I was asked repeatedly if I was comfortable. At first there was some discomfort but not quite pain- more vaginal than uterus. A few minutes later I felt a little bit of cramping so he upped my IV pain medicine to make sure to stay ahead of it. I felt maybe about five cramp twinges after the procedure. Nothing too painful- similar to cramps before a period. Just light pain that’s gone quickly. 

Bleeding has been minimal. For me, this is similar to the days after heavy period bleeding. It hasn’t been long but so far no clots or lumps anymore which is a relief. The pain medicine is just wearing off now. I feel a little achy in my uterus- again similar to period pain but not bad. I’m debating taking something for it. If I wasn’t just on the couch alone thinking about how I feel I wouldn’t even notice the pain. 


Mentally, I had strong feelings of “I don’t want to do this” last night and this morning. But once I was in the pre-op bed, I felt better and more settled. After the procedure I felt good. It was very cathartic after so long! I would have been close to 12 weeks now and there were problems starting at 5 weeks so it’s just wonderful to feel like I’m really done! There was a six week old baby just a curtain away from me crying and I wanted to hold that baby or just see it so freaking bad!!! The staff apologized for putting me next to a baby and offered to move me but I said I liked being near a baby. More tears but not sad tears. 

If there was no risk of scar tissue I would have chosen D&C right away and today confirmed that for me. I’ve sorta experienced all three options this miscarriage and D&C was the least painful, least messy, and easiest (for me) emotionally.

<p>Should I return the device, wait for the update, look into Tempdrop, or give up on wearables all together? I am waiting to see an RE so not sure if I will need the temps long term but I sure do like confirming O and getting a heads up when my period is coming.</p>

I guess this is my intro post! Last week I had my first MC at 5w5d. This was my first time pregnant after 3 or 4 cycles of trying

Last Monday I went to EPU for spotting, suspecting it was innocent but the ultrasound suggested my bean stopped growing a week prior. My bloodtest came back with HCG levels of 900 and progesterone of 2.8 which confirmed this wouldn’t be a viable pregnancy. 
My body miscarriaged relatively quickly and i’m ready to start trying again next week. Exciting but scary at the same time. 

I’m obviously super anxious about things. I want to understand if this was bad luck or if there’s something wrong that needs fixing. I don’t want to rely only on ‘time will tell’, i want to start investigating if my fertility meets the fundamental basic requirements. I’m looking for answers to questions as: Are my progesterone levels normal? Do i suffer from hypothyroidism? Do i suffer from blood clotting? Is my uterus lining in optimal condition? etc. 

I live in the UK and am at the mercy of NHS who wont do a thing till i’ve miscarriaged 3x. I’m happy to go private but i simply don’t know where i should start.

What type of specialist should i see, what testing should i prioritise and when? I will have to pay out of pocket. Any advise would be super useful. I’m just looking to empower myself with information, with the hope it will put my anxiety at ease -or- help me identify solutions as soon as possible.  As an FYI- I’m based in London in case there are any London locals.

Thank you all

Unfortunately that pregnancy was short lived and I miscarried at 6w in April. My OB gave me the go ahead to try as soon as I wanted and said it was unnecessary to wait until I'd gotten a period. 

I had a lovely LH surge on April 19-20 and thought my body was returning to normal and treating the MC like a period, which is what my OB said would happen. Except I'm now 9 days past my LH peak without a single progesterone symptom in sight. Normally they start almost immediately after ovulation, never this late, so I'm pretty certain I didn't ovulate. 

I'm now on cycle #3, a totally wasted cycle out of the very few I have left before I'm supposed to get fertility help. I feel like there's a countdown until cycle #6, like I'm halfway to infertility. Next cycle I'll be 2/3 of the way there. 

I feel so much disappointment in my body. First I could've carry my baby, and now I'm not recovering like my OB said I should. Right now my body just feels hormonally dead. Not a twinge of breast soreness or swelling, not a hint of a cramp or even a bit of bloating. My LH is the lowest I've seen it in any cycle (PreMom says .1 - .15, when my usual lows are .2 and higher). I just feel absolutely nothing when usually I can feel various somethings all throughout my cycle.

I don't feel like I can talk to anyone about how I feel right now. My soon-to-be husband just tells me it's normal after a miscarriage. I know it is, but now by body has failed again and we're one month closer to an infertility diagnosis. I look much younger so he just doesn't get that my likelihood of conceiving is lower and risk of miscarriage higher. 

We are getting married in 3 days and I keep thinking about how different everything would be if I were still pregnant. We were planning to tell his parents even though it would have only been 10 weeks because they're here from out of the country and it would have been the only way to tell them in person. Now I just feel sad and can't even tell anyone why I'm acting so moody.

I feel so disappointed right now. My OB thought I would conceive again quickly and easily and that my body would return to normal immediately, and instead here I am poking my breasts for the hundredth time to see if they're sore yet and realizing that they are but only because of the other 99 times I've jabbed them.

204,2048,confidence,<praw.reddit.Reddit object at 0x7f12a630cd90>,,ttcafterloss,"   So here we go.  I don’t know how much detail intros usually go into, I’ve just begun researching today... Thursday was supposed to be my anatomy scan, for my second pregnancy but my third child. (The first I have raised and have custody of but is not biological or legally my own child.) I put on my cutest new maternity clothes, a little make up, felt cute. My husband recently started a new job working nights and forgot about the appointment. He told me to wake him to go, and I tried once, but he looked at me bewildered and didn’t truly wake up, so I let him sleep. My stepmom was meeting me there, and we were not planning on finding out the gender, so I thought everything would be fine. He’s not missing much, I’d just bring him pictures. I felt a little dread in that decision.. what if something was wrong? No, I’m paranoid. That was definitely a little kick just then. 


   I walk in and explain why my husband didn’t come with me. My stepmom jokes about telling him there was a twin they missed in the first ultrasound. I check in, we’re called back. Asked if we plan to find out the gender and stepmom says she would lovvve to but knows we aren’t going to. I was nervous about that because she was begging from the day she found out I was pregnant to know the sex, that she could keep a secret and be the only one. She completely accepted our decision when it became relevant. Feeling more at ease. Things begin and I can’t really tell what I’m looking at. That’s a head but how is baby laying? Weird. I’m no expert, she says that’s an arm bone. Neat. 


   She asks me to go leave a urine sample and come back for a vaginal ultrasound. I didn’t feel like I had to pee but I do my best and I can make out the rib cage and spine. I see the head again and notice it measures at 16w3d. Weird, I was 20w1d. Also hadn’t gained weight yet this pregnancy, so maybe the baby was just measuring small? Oh well. I won’t panic until the doctor tells me to. Shortly after this she checks the ribs out again and I didn’t even notice... then she leans over and tells me she isn’t finding a heartbeat. Everything feels blank? My stepmom is asking questions. Ultrasound tech repeats that she doesn’t see a heartbeat and is going to ask the doctor how she wants to proceed. My stepmom panics and cries instantly. Her tears bring my tears. She calls my husband and tells him to come up there immediately. 


   We move to a room and it takes a long time and people keep apologizing and I just feel bad for making them uncomfortable. The doctor says my baby’s heart stopped just a couple days after my last appointment at 16w. I realize I’ve been carrying a dead fetus for nearly a month... she tells me my options are to go home and wait for my body to react or I can go to the hospital and get things started. I don’t have to decide right away. I definitely want to get this over with. My job involves a lot of standing around and being left with my thoughts and I was supposed to work the next day. I couldn’t face that... I couldn’t face staying at home with my thoughts either. I needed to deal with this immediately. 


   We get the car situation figured out since we had three vehicles and I was no longer allowed to be alone, so I was left with my grandmother while they fixed the cars and packed my bag. We head to the hospital and it becomes real. I cry again. Two people at registration ask me what I’m there for and no one really told me... I didn’t have words. My stepmom handled the first person. The second one I was alone for and just said my baby’s heart stopped and broke down. I get into my room and see the baby things everywhere and panic and cry again. I don’t sit on the bed until they ask me to put on the gown. Liquid diet from here on out. Then so much more waiting. My children visit and my oldest is having a really hard time accepting that she can’t be in the room for the birth like we originally talked about. I told her it’s not going to be the way she thinks but all she keeps saying as she sobs is that she wants to be able to say goodbye to the baby. I was broken for her.. she eventually calms down and asks me when we will try again. Another awkward conversation. They stay for a while and distract me from all the awfulness happening. 


   Loads of cytotech all night. No progress. My dr described it as enough cytotech to “birth a horse.” She starts pitocin. It takes most of the day to make progress. My water finally breaks. I wake up to another cervical check and cytotech dose but she determines my baby is right there and asks if I would like to push. I push twice and out comes my little 3oz baby boy. My husband, aunt, stepmom, and I are all crying. I hold my baby once, for only a minute and hand him back once she tells me he was a boy. They take him and I sob some more. Then my aunt and stepmom leave me alone with my husband. I spent a lot of time staring at the ceiling. Trying not to cry anymore because I still hate crying in front of people. Even when it’s appropriate. It takes 4 hours and they call a dr to come help remove the placenta because I was unable to push it out. They wake my husband for me so he can hold my hand because my vagina was sore from all the cytotech and the speculum is NEVER comfortable. It was over and even more real. The next morning I cried. And cried. And cried. Finally getting to go home after getting my memory box with his tiny footprints and my aftercare instructions and note for returning to work. Showered and spent the rest of the day trying to feel normal again. Sleep in my own bed was wonderful. 


   And here I am now. It’s been a few days and I’m becoming more curious about what happened. I know grieving will take a while and some moments I’ll be okay and not others. I know that pathology may not bring me answers and I’m prepared for that as well. I know it was nothing I did and probably/hopefully not going to happen again. Now I just want to know how to proceed. I’m calling to set up my two week follow up tomorrow and trying to make a list of questions for my doctor. I know I want to try again and yet I know it’s going to be the longest wait and there’s going to be so much worry... this lost pregnancy was almost flying by. Anyways, that’s my story. I hope I made this inappropriately, I was hoping typing it out would make the last few days feel real. I still have my baby’s ultrasound photos on display in my room.

My husband and I have been together since high school and, after 11 years together, we finally got married in October 2017. We have 2 daughters who are now 11 and 8. After we got married we decided to start trying for a sibling for our girls.

In September of last year I found out I was pregnant after trying for nearly 6 months. During the time that I would've conceived, I was under immense stress from a job that I hated, fighting with my husband, and contemplating going back to school. After a particularly stressful day, I decided to take a test and it came back positive. I wasn't as excited as I hoped I would be because of the stress from work and the fights with my husband. He didn't seem too excited either.

About a week later my oldest daughter fell off her bike and suffered a concussion. I was so worried about her but I couldn't show her so I just held it in. She was very confused and for a couple of hours she had loss of short term memory. I kept trying to soothe her but I think just my presence and the fact that I'm an EMT helped make her feel ok (she kept saying ""I'm so glad you work for the ambulance!"" haha). At one point I even contemplated telling her she was going to be a big sister again just to give her something else to think about, other than being in the ER. I didn't end up letting her in on the secret, and I'm thankful for that.

A week after my daughter's accident, I miscarried. It didn't hit me right away. I think because I'm an EMT I knew what was happening and didn't let myself feel the emotions that come with it. Eventually though, I broke. I was at work, trying to act like everything was normal, and then I just couldn't be there anymore. I broke down in the middle of the day and told my boss. She sent me home and I just let myself feel. It was the worst pain I had ever felt.

Eventually things got back to normal for me. I ended up starting school 2 weeks later. It helped me get through my grief and I'm still going strong, but I don't know if I'll be ok tomorrow.
