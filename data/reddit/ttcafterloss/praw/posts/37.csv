I tried so hard to find a place where I felt like my story would fit in. It was wonderful to come across /r/ttcafterloss because I saw that this wasn't just about trying to conceive, but it also seems like a place to speak about what happened, so here is the story of my Five day old warrior Cole Jordan. 

Cole was born full term on February 10th 2017, to my husband and I, but he was born very sick. I don't even really know how to explain it anymore because it hurts to talk about it. He was born with Vein of Galen Aneurysmal Malformation, Ventriculomegaly, Heart Failure, Pulmonary Hypertension, Kidney Failure, and was Jaundiced, which caused him to be put on a ventilator and sedated at only a few hours old. Soon after he Developed Hydrocephalus and was transferred to a bigger hospital with neurosurgeons and interventional radiologists who could help him better, and he went through an embolization procedure to block off one of the feeder veins that was connected to this Malformation. After that procedure we sat down with the doctors who showed all of my family and I MRI scans and what his Brain looked like compared to a child who wasn't born with this Malformation and problems, and we found out that he was practically brain dead. That was when we decided to take him off of the ventilator and put him on comfort care, so that he could be with us and we could hold him in his last moments. He fought for 30 minutes while my husband and I held him and loved him and read to him until he finally closed his eyes for the last time. It's been almost two weeks now and I miss him more and more everyday. It hurts to know that in two weeks he will have already been gone a month.

3,2048,confidence,<praw.reddit.Reddit object at 0x7f12a630cd90>,,ttcafterloss,"I've been lurking on this sub for the last few months since my miscarriage in October, but I don't post to Reddit much in general and I haven't posted here at all. This was my first pregnancy and first miscarriage. When I went in for my first ultrasound at 7 weeks, they said I was measuring at 5 weeks and scheduled me to come back 2 weeks later. So when I should have been 7 weeks at the second ultrasound, I was still measuring at 5 weeks. So I was somewhere between 7-9 weeks pregnant when I had my missed miscarriage. 

I had a rough time through the holidays and basically until the end of the year. I saw too many pregnancy announcements from people who got pregnant around the same time I did, so I deactivated my Facebook for a while. The holidays were hard because we had planned to announce to extended family on Thanksgiving, and we would've found out the gender sometime in December near Christmas. So I wallowed in my sadness during that time, ate a lot of junk food and watched a lot of Netflix.

Then around the new year, I was finally feeling better. I started to get in a routine to get back in shape - all that junk food and wallowing really helped me pack on the holiday weight. I redecorated the room that was supposed to be a nursery into a very cute guest room that I am super proud of. I stopped creeping on this sub as much, and all in all things were good.

Until yesterday, when one of my very good friends said she had something to tell me. We were supposed to get together the day before, but I cancelled because I'm going out of town next week and had a lot to get done before I leave. So she messaged me yesterday with a big build up that she had something she was going to tell me the day before. She said she wanted to tell me sooner, she wasn't sure how to tell me and didn't want to upset me, they were telling people this weekend but I won't be in town, so she didn't want me to find out another way. At this point I could pretty much guess where she was going with this, but I went ahead and asked what was going on, and of course she's pregnant. 

At that point I was so glad I cancelled on her, because it was way easier to act excited through text instead of in person. So told her congratulations and asked her all the general questions you usually ask when someone says they're pregnant. I'm not sure I would have been able to do that if she surprised me with this news in person. 

Now I feel like I've regressed all the way back to how I felt in October. It feels like someone's punched me in the stomach, I'm constantly on the verge of tears, and it's all I've been able to think about. Obviously I'm happy for her and her husband, they just got married a few months ago and it's their first. But the thought of being around her and talking to her about anything (pregnancy related or not) makes me want to curl up in a ball and cry. 

I love her to death, but she's one of those people who will complain about a subject in her life *constantly*. Before she got engaged, her boyfriend was dragging his feet with the proposal. So that was all she would ever talk about to anybody who would listen, and I have witnessed (on more than one occasion) her complaining to people she literally just met about how her boyfriend wouldn't propose. Then after she got engaged, it was all about the wedding planning and wedding drama. Now I know it's going to be all about her pregnancy, and I don't think I can handle that. She's already started complaining about it to me when we were messaging yesterday. When I asked her how she had been feeling (so to be fair, I *did* ask), she went into a long spill about how terrible her morning sickness was, how exhausted she is, how she can't paint the nursery, ect. 

So to end my rant - how do I deal with this?? My friend group all know about my miscarriage, but I have the feeling they'll think it's been long enough ago that I should be over it by now and won't even think being around her would be hard for me. I don't want to make a big deal about it to them, and of course she should be allowed to talk about her pregnancy and be excited about it with the people she cares about.  I also work with her husband, so I feel like I also won't be able to escape it at work either (although he won't talk about it near as much as she would). But what do I do if hearing about it puts me in such a fragile state? Will it get better as she gets further into her pregnancy, or will it get worse? Has anyone been through a similar experience?

Vienna Cordelia: born silently on January 25th at 10:30am, 14.5 inches, 2.01 pounds.

V was delivered at 32 weeks and passed during labor. We found out Vienna had Trisomy 18 at 31 weeks. At 32 weeks I was measuring past full term because of the excess amniotic fluid, and because of the health problems the excess weight was causing, was urged to induce as soon as possible. How do you make the decision to give birth, knowing that when you do, you're deciding when your baby will die? I could feel her kicking inside me as I made arrangements with the funeral home -- life can be so cruel. 

A stocked nursery, shelves of books, an assembled stroller...there are many ways to prepare for a baby; there's no way to prepare for the loss of your baby. 

I've been lurking here and thought I'd say hello now. My husband and I aren't trying again, not yet. Thank you all for sharing your stories, for sharing your joy and pain.

Bleeding had stopped at CD16 so on CD21 and CD22 I went running (took it easy), and had (gentle!) BD. The next day, CD23, I had a massive secondary bleed, almost went to hospital but decided to wait it out, and then the bleeding stopped overnight. I've had minimal to no brown spotting since.

I followed up with my GP who was a little concerned about my ""borderline low grade fever"", but I showed her my temp chart and explained I thought I was in my luteal phase which was why my temp was a bit higher than normal. She sent me for a blood test including Beta HCG, and a pelvic ultrasound. Here is what I know:

1/ Temp chart, OPK and CM all support that I ovulated on CD 24, the day after the hemorrhage. This was then confirmed by the US tech who said I'd recently ovulated from my left ovary. 

2/ My FRER was negative this morning so im pretty sure my HCG is back below 5. TBC by blood tests.

3/ I haven't got the ultrasound report but from looking at the images I'm pretty certain things don't look ""normal"" - it looks like there is fluid and/or tissue in my uterus (there is a black space in the middle of the layers of endometrium)

I'll be seeing my GP again tomorrow but I'm hoping to hear if anyone has had any similar experiences in terms of having RPOC despite normal HCG / Ovulation. I'm wondering if I am likely to pass the rest with my next AF (which is due in 9 days based on O date) or if I am likely to need more miso or a D&C.

Obviously the past week has been salt in the wound for me as I was so happy to be Oing again and ""back to normal"", but everything went to hell.

Thank you x

I hate that this is my life. To top it off, many people expect me to be over it. Example A: People telling me about other pregnant people and &quot;how they feel so badly that they got pregnant recently and don&#39;t really want another a child and here I am, trying desperately.&quot; (Yup that was a quote- people suck) Thanks so much. Example B: My husband expects me to go on a work trip with him knowing there are pregnant people.- This means all of the women will be taking about babies so I&#39;ll be stuck in my hotel room. He says I need to stop dwelling on the past. WTF? Our child died.  Example C: People telling me what&#39;s best for me. &quot;Go back to work, it will be good for you.&quot; &quot;Don&#39;t stress about it.&quot; 
I&#39;m thinking of a word that starts with F.....
To top it off, I&#39;m pretty sure I didn&#39;t get pregnant this cycle and that will just set me off. Did anyone else go crazy once they started trying? I hate this...I&#39;m just so sad and miserable. Why is it so hard for some women to have a healthy pregnancy? I&#39;m angry- my life is not suppose to be like this. How am I suppose to accept this for the rest of my life? It&#39;s a really hard pill to swallow.</p>

Almost a year ago, I was amazed to find myself sitting on my couch at home within about 12 hours of her birth.  Just 12 hours after her little heart quit beating while she was in my arms. It was a mix of me wanting to get the hell out of the hospital and them not really having any medical reason for me to stay.  I was more lost sitting on that couch than I have ever been.

One of the first things I did after taking a terribly traumatic shower and going through the motions of trying to eat a meal was to get out my laptop and post Scarlet's birth story on the BabyBumps sub. As we all do here in our role as first responder to baby loss posts, several people jumped in and recommended that I come over to this sub, including our dear Mangoes.  

There was no instruction manual for how to handle my grief. No one in my life to give me any truly helpful advice for how to march on.  Internet searches brought up articles and stories, but it was just that- reading material. It wasn't outreach. You were all my lifeline.  I woke up every day and this sub was my lifeline. My connection to ""my people."" You all became my tribe, and the only people who could truly know and understand what I was going through. 

Scarlet's birthday is on Wednesday.  Time has marched on, whether I was ready or not.  And it has occurred to me that this amazing group of internet strangers went from being internet strangers to some of the people I care about the most and people who were most supportive in helping me survive my first year as a bereaved parent.  

I've been feeling extra thankful for this community lately.  We are collection of broken-hearted people who care so much about helping other broken-hearted people get through similar things as we are going through.  There is so much heart here.  To people new here (I'm so sorry you have to be here), and people who've been here longer than me (I'm so sorry you have to be here), thank you.  I wouldn't have made it through the last year of my life without you.  You've helped me through the broken part. You've helped me through the putting myself back together part. You've helped me through the worst days, and made me feel ok when I started having some good days. You helped me realized that it was ok when joy started creeping back in to my life. You've helped me through surviving milestones, dealing with triggers, and how to handle the people I encounter who don't understand what we've been through.

I wish that the last year of my life had gone differently. I wish that Scarlet could be here in my lap instead of in an urn on my mantle.  I couldn't wish or hope for a better group of friends than you all.  This is the world's shittiest club and I wish that none of us had to be here, but thank you for being there for me the past year.  Thank for helping me to heal.  I wish everyone had a tribe like this to take care of them.  There's a love and compassion here that is very rare to find.

Hi all- I haven't posted in a while but I'm still lurking. 
My birthday is coming up in less than a week and I decided a couple of months ago that I don't want to even acknowledge it.  My husband thinks I'm being silly but it has nothing to do with the age. I'm turning 39 but I am just so sick of seeing all these markers of time.  It's just another reminder that another year has passed and we still don't have a baby at home with us.  Our baby girl died 18 months ago today after 2 weeks in the NICU and I've had a CP 7 months ago, 2 failed IUIs and we just finished off an egg retrieval for IVF.  I'm happy to say that we have 4 frozen embryos that are chromosomally normal awaiting transfer hopefully in April.  That's a great gain for us and we are happy at the results but I've been missing my baby girl so much lately.  I have these vivid memories of her in the NICU and it's just been so painful lately.  This past week marked 2 years since I had my LMP from my pregnancy with her.  I found out I was pregnant a couple of weeks after my 37th birthday and I remember thinking that I had my last birthday without children and I didn't even know it.  So much for that.    
I read that dear sugar article recently and I have it bookmarked on my phone.  There's a sentence where she says- your baby will always be dead... it's really just devastating to read that.  
I don't know what I'm writing but I just feel so alone in this so often.  My life is so different than it used to be. My social anxiety is through the roof. I've become so cold with people who don't know me because I don't want to invite small talk where people could potentially ask if we have children.  I'm just so sick of hiding out and being sad because it is really fucking sad and it sucks.  I'm doing much better than I was a year ago, I just never imagined that I would be here now.  I see a therapist regularly and I know that what I am dealing with is ""normal"" but I don't want to live on ""Planet my baby died"" anymore.

37,2048,confidence,<praw.reddit.Reddit object at 0x7f12a630cd90>,,ttcafterloss,"Just warning that this may be a wall of text but it's a story I believe I need to tell. 

My wife and I have been married for 6 years and have  no children so far.  We began our married life with the agreement that until we were better off financially, we would not try to get pregnant.  She was on the pill and we used condoms if she forgot to take a pill. After three years of hard work, we fill we're ready. We decide at first that we'll just stop using any birth control and if it happens, it happens. 

After a while, we actually begin to try. We charted her ovulation, took her temperature every morning, and reading as much as we could about what we could do to get pregnant. We did everything but go to a doctor. Like most people, we were afraid of being told that we couldn't have children. But then last December, our prayers seemed to have been answered with a positive pregnancy test.  We ended up taking 4 tests just to make sure it wasn't a false positive. 

For the next month, we contacted an OBGYN for an appointment, made plans of how we would announce, who we would tell first, and talking about all the things we would need to get. But our joy was short lived. While my wife was out of town, she called me and told me that she was bleeding and cramping.  When she got home we went straight to the emergency room. They confirmed the pregnancy and then tried to find the baby on an ultrasound but could not. They also said her hormone levels were low. Our OB appointment was later that week so the emergency room doctor told us to go home, be on bed rest, and then go to the OB. However, if there is any change, such as extreme pain or bleeding, to head straight back to the emergency room.  

The next morning I leave for work and my wife stays at home and I tell her to call me if anything happens.  Right as I'm pulling into work, my wife calls me and I can tell that she is in pain.  Our conversation went something like this:

Me: Are you okay?

Her: I don't know.

Me: You don't sound okay, I'm coming home right now. 

I told my boss and I rush home. I had to practically carry my wife down the stairs of our apartment and put her in the car. We rush to the hospital and every bump in the road seems to send waves of pain throughout her body. 

After getting to the emergency room things moved like a blur. They got her into ultrasound and you can seen the serious look on the ultrasound tech's face. As we're heading back to her room, the nurse meets us in the hallway and asks, ""Was it positive?"" and the ultrasound tech just nods. Within a minute, a doctor is in the room with us explaining to us that she will need to be have surgery. She had an ectopic pregnancy, it had implanted in her Fallopian tube, and it had burst. Blood was leaking into her abdomen and she would need to have the burst fallopian tube removed. It wasn't even noon yet and I was giving my wife a goodbye kiss as she was being wheeled into surgery. The surgeon came out and told me that my wife had made it but that if I had waited even just a little while, she would not have made it. 

It's been a month since the surgery and we've received a huge outpouring of support from our friends and family. We've been working through what's happened and it's finally hitting us that we've lost our baby. We're doing everything we can to keep our hopes up for the future but for now, we're still in mourning. We're feeling crushed by the fact that one moment we're getting ready to become parents and the next my wife is having surgery to save her life and our baby is gone. 

TL:DR - We lost our baby and almost my wife due to an ectopic pregnancy.

I have had 5 losses: 1 miscarriage at around 7 weeks in grad school in 2009, then 4 early chemical pregnancies this year. The most recent one was two weeks ago. 

All of this year's losses have been incredibly early, happening around 10 or 11DPO. I get a faint positive pregnancy test, then incredibly heavy bleeding and intense pain. (The first time it happened, I wasn't testing early so I actually went to the hospital, thinking a cyst had burst or something). 

I recently saw an RE who says that they do sound like early losses, and will be doing rpl testing and karyotyping, along with a bunch more thyroid tests (since some of mine indicated problems). I'll also be starting progesterone after my 7DPO progesterone test, to see if that makes any difference.

To be honest, I took the first 3 in stride, but I've been struggling after this fourth loss. I took the negative comments on r/infertility really hard -- harder than they warranted -- and ever since I feel like I've fallen down a dark hole. Three felt like bad luck, but 4 feels like I will never be pregnant. I haven't told that many people, but a few of the people I've told have blamed my busy work schedule and have said I'm pushing myself too hard. I really worry that this will never happen.

For those of you who have had repeated early losses, does it ever get routine? I thought I was handling this well, but I don't think I am anymore.

My expected AF was Sunday Feb. 12th, and with a period that's clockwork and always arrives on either CD26 or CD27, when it didn't show up I figured our efforts paid off and were finally pregnant. On Monday Feb. 13th, using FMU, I took an FRER and it came out positive. Two days later, on the wednesday I experienced some very light pink bleeding, was assured it was fine but took another FRER to see. Went to the store, bought one,  went home and didn't use FMU, but still got a positive that was slightly darker than Monday's result. 

I called my doctor and went in for an appointment the next day, the bleeding had increased and was a bright almost still pink red before attending the doctor. I took a urine sample at the office and some clots were forming. Nurse did a urine test and said it was negative. She sent me for blood tests to confirm, and I received a call today that those were also negative (she said my HCG was around 4, which is considered negative).

I've had what basically is a period since Wednesday, just ending this morning. So, I guess I'm wondering was this a CP? My doctor said I just got two false positives, but it seems odd that I would get two false positives on two different days and with tests even bought on different days.

After getting the horrible news that I had a blighted ovum at my dating scan (confirmation was on January 12, I was 8 weeks then), I had to take cytotec vaginally on the 12th, but two days later it was found to be incomplete, and so I was actually on cytotec until the 19th of January. So my last day of cytotec was less than a month ago. Normally, before I get my period, I have quite tender breasts, moodiness and pimples. I had no tender breasts or pimples (I've been moody for a month, so I couldn't use that), but I spotted a little yesterday and my husband remarked that I might be getting my period (maybe I was moodier than I have been???).

After getting the horrible news that I had a blighted ovum at my dating scan (confirmation was on January 12, I was 8 weeks then), I had to take cytotec vaginally on the 12th, but two days later it was found to be incomplete, and so I was actually on cytotec until the 19th of January. So my last day of cytotec was less than a month ago. Normally, before I get my period, I have quite tender breasts, moodiness and pimples. I had no tender breasts or pimples (I&#39;ve been moody for a month, so I couldn&#39;t use that), but I spotted a little yesterday and my husband remarked that I might be getting my period (maybe I was moodier than I have been???).

Background on my journey- I stopped the BCP last May when I got married and we were probably more NTNP than anything for awhile due to tons of family visits. We were hoping it would happen but we weren't BDing as much or when we should. Around September I believe we were really trying actively. We started with daily BD and then switched to EOD when daily didn't do anything for two cycles. 

We got a BFP at the end of January and we were so excited!! We didn't expect that at all. I had gotten a BFN that Tuesday with FMU on FRER, BFN Friday after work on FRER, and when AF didn't seem to be showing up Saturday, I tested on Sunday with FMU with E@H and got 3 faint BFPs and a BFN on a FRER Digi. I confirmed at the clinic Monday that I was pregnant. 

Well this past Monday I spent the evening in the ER for bleeding. Wednesday my OB confirmed my levels were dropping and I had miscarried. I was only 6 weeks.  DH and I have been pretty upset over it but we are ready to jump back into the saddle ASAP. 

I think what made this more exciting for us and then even more devastating is that DH is getting deployed in a few months and we were happy to have it before he left. Now I'm hoping those fertility rumors have some grain of truth to them because we really want to try to conceive again before he deploys.

So... Yesterday when i went for my 11 week scan the dr saw baby stopped growin a couple weeks ago, and no heartbeat, we scheduled a D&C for today and they told me insurance had me covered, nope, today when i got there they told me i had to pay out of pocket because insurance doesn't cover abort*ons, excuse me?? So after this traumatic experience I had to call my husband and get him to transfer money to our checkings account to pay for something I would've rather not have, I didn't chose to have a d&c, I HAD TO, and then when i go in to check vitals and all that fun stuff, they ask me if i know that my blood type is negative, Yes, I informed the nurse on the first appointment, I also informed that husband's blood type is also negative, and she said it wasn't on file, that I should have gotten an shot for that on the first appointment (thanks awesome nurse), and they also tell me that they found i have a uti, yes, I've known for two weeks, that's how long it took them to get me a prescription, i spent the last 2 weeks calling the Drs office and the pharmacy with no results, so yeah safe to say, looking for a new OB in Los Angeles, if any of you awesome ladies can recommend someone who actually cares about their patients it would be greatly appreciated ❤

First loss at 11 weeks, 7 months ago. Second loss at 7 weeks a few days ago.

""Follow up"" appointment with my GP today. Established that I'd miscarried. (good, we don't have to awkwardly tell her, she's read her files).

Highlights:

2 miscarriages in a row - not worth investigating. Could totally happen to anyone. (I'm irritated, because in my head I'm going it's not 'unlucky', just state it as a statistic, say it's statistically unlikely. Say it's less than 2%. Stop fluff talking me. I'm a big girl who graduated high school and understands math.)

Call us early next time and we'll get you in for bloodwork to track your HCG! And then you'll know if it's a ""good pregnancy"" early! (Oh great. Sounds super helpful. My numbers were good with this pregnancy on the first blood test. Blood tests to don't miscarriages...) Call early next time and we'll get you in for an ultrasound at 8 weeks!  (You said that last time Doc, and here I am, at my first appointment, 4 weeks after I got my positive test. How do I get in sooner if you are so booked up?)

No referral to repeated loss clinic is necessary because you're only 30 and repeated loss clinic is meant of 35+. Because time is more of the essence for those ladies. (This is not what their website says. But never mind, I'm just some broad who's been reading the internet)

No other testing is needed at this time. Everything is fine, we'll see you soon with the next pregnancy! Smile smile smile. (Barf)

I am upset. I am absolutely frustrated with British Columbia health care. I do not understand why I even bother to go to a GP when I could go to the ER and get the basics done there. The ER will do bloodwork at least. The ER will do an ultrasound (if it's between 9-5. If not, no dice, come back tomorrow. Thanks BC system!)

I don't know what I wanted, but I hoped she'd give a shit that I now have two losses, and one chemical loss. (Do Chemical losses not count? Or do they only count in some countries? Provinces? wtf)

My (very pregnant) Doctor asked me if maybe my dates were wrong, but I took OPK's last month and know exactly when I ovulated - should have been 7w3d, just had an empty 5w sac. I kind of had a feeling it wouldn't work out, my betas started on the low side and I had no symptoms for the past week, and as soon as I saw the ultrasound screen I knew it wasn't normal. I'm disappointed and hurt but I'm so much more emotionally prepared for this than I was the first time, so there's that. That makes 2 losses back-to-back, I guess I'm in the minority now?

I have my misoprostol tablets on the counter, just waiting 'til tomorrow morning to take them to start the process.

I asked Doc what testing options were available... so she's running blood tests on my thyroid and on anticardiolipin antibodies. But she didn't really offer anything beyond that, and I'm not sure what else I need to be looking for. I'm O+ blood type so Rh sensitivity isn't a worry.

I heard something about 23andme being able to diagnose MTHFR gene mutations... is that a good first step?

If you wonderful folks know of any other options for testing I'd be most appreciative. My insurance only lets me see specialists through referrals, and Doc didn't seem overly eager to send me to a genetic counselor or anything yet. Should husband be getting a Sperm Analysis? He's currently uninsured as he recently lost his job but if it's affordable out-of-pocket is it something we should look into?

I kind of had a feeling it wouldn&#39;t work out, my betas started on the low side and I had no symptoms for the past week, and as soon as I saw the ultrasound screen I knew it wasn&#39;t normal. I&#39;m disappointed and hurt but I&#39;m so much more emotionally prepared for this than I was the first time, so there&#39;s that. That makes 2 losses back-to-back, I guess I&#39;m in the minority now?</p>

<p>I have my misoprostol tablets on the counter, just waiting &#39;til tomorrow morning to take them to start the process.</p>

<p>I asked Doc what testing options were available... so she&#39;s running blood tests on my thyroid and on anticardiolipin antibodies. But she didn&#39;t really offer anything beyond that, and I&#39;m not sure what else I need to be looking for. I&#39;m O+ blood type so Rh sensitivity isn&#39;t a worry.</p>

<p>I heard something about 23andme being able to diagnose MTHFR gene mutations... is that a good first step?</p>

<p>If you wonderful folks know of any other options for testing I&#39;d be most appreciative. My insurance only lets me see specialists through referrals, and Doc didn&#39;t seem overly eager to send me to a genetic counselor or anything yet. Should husband be getting a Sperm Analysis? He&#39;s currently uninsured as he recently lost his job but if it&#39;s affordable out-of-pocket is it something we should look into?</p>

<p>Thanks much, friends.</p>
