So, 11 months ago my husband and I lost a baby at 20 weeks. 2.5 weeks after that he deployed to Iraq for nine months. He's been back for 10 weeks and we have been trying like crazy. No luck yet. I'm 38 and we don't have any kids yet, so time is running short.

Well, we just got word where we are moving next. Japan! I'm vey excited - what a great opportunity. We will leave in July 2020. HOWEVER. That means that if I were to get pregnant right now, TODAY, I would give birth about two weeks before we move halfway across the world. And if I'm NOT pregnant, that might be even more complicated.

I asked my OB about how soon I can start trying again after I stop bleeding. She kept recommending after my first period. So I had to ask - can I have unprotected sex before my first period? She said of course, but I should give myself time to heal physically and emotionally. She added that I was still young and healthy (I'm 28) so there's no medical reason to be too eager at this moment. 

I guess I'll interpret that as something like ""as long as you feel ok, go ahead"". 

I'm not sure how lucky I'll be, but plan to start tracking my ovulation in a few days. I'm also going to start temping - I've never done it before but thought I'd give it a try... I feel like a data-driven approach will keep me distracted and more informed, so we'll see. 

I feel bad for so quickly replacing thoughts of my first baby with hopes of conceiving again. I won't ever forget that baby, but I guess life goes on and we've got to keep moving with the tick of the clock.

43,2048,confidence,<praw.reddit.Reddit object at 0x7f12a630cd90>,,ttcafterloss,"Hello all, so sorry that we are all here.  I thought I'd do a little intro, share my story and ask a question. 

We've been TTC since January.  All my cycles are approx 31 days.  I've been doing OPKs from the beginning and we've been timing intercourse accordingly.

Cycle 1: luteal phase bleeding from 2dpo until period.  Used digital advanced OPK, no estrogen rise, but LH surge did happen. BFN

Cycle 2: virtually the same as cycle 1, but started using easy@home OPKs (I prefer them).  Bought an Ava to start temping. Suspect no ovulation, BFN.

Went to Dr and she said to wait a couple more cycles because I'd come off birth control and my hormones still need to equilibrate.

Cycle 3: Took vitex this cycle because I'm too impatient (many reasons I chose vitex which I won't list here, for brevity sake) and really started temping.  I got VERY strong and very obvious ovulation pains this month, no luteal phase spotting, temp rise, BFP! 

9 weeks in I have my first ultrasound, everything is going amazingly and I'm over the moon!  Until... Dr calls and says that although the baby is measuring the right size (9w), there is no heartbeat.  She suggests I take Misoprostol.  I ask if I can have a confirmatory ultrasound and she says no - they're sure.  But I'm not sure!  What if my report got mixed up with some other unfortunate soul's?  I can't take Misoprostol without being sure, so I call a fertility clinic and ask if I can pay for an ultrasound just to check the heartbeat... Nope! Not a patient!  So I do something I don't like myself for... I go to the ER and say I'm pregnant and bleeding.  They do an ultrasound and I can tell from the techs face that it is really true.  They call in the on call OB and she is amazing!  Completely understands, offers me a ""second"" ultrasound (of course I didn't tell them I'd already had a first ultrasound in fear that they'd refuse to give me a second).  OB offers an appointment and give me all sorts of advice and eases a lot of my worries.  

At this point, I'm thinking the anovulatory cycles were just because of coming off birth control and everything would be fine from now on... I was wrong. 

Took a full 8 weeks from finding out about the MMC to getting a period.  In there, I took Misoprostol, but had retained products that went unnoticed because the ultrasound clinic in my city books over 4 weeks out... I had a terrible experience passing these retained products in public.  It was a traumatic experience. I had my ultrasound for retained products after this, and there were even MORE retained products, which I passed at home the next day.

Cycle 4: finally! I think I got my period! It's a bit shorter than usual, but I did lose a lot of blood from the miscarriage!  I was still pretty emotionally distraught so I didn't want to stress too much about tracking, so I just did OPKs.  No ovulation pains. BFN

Cycle 5 (present cycle): now I'm into temping, OPKs and other symptoms I'd been tracking before as well.  Of course, the one cycle I felt like I ovulated was the cycle I took vitex, so I started taking it again.  This time, no ovulation pains and I'm on CD 21 (usually O CD18), LH was faint from the day I started testing (CD13) (which is not usual/normal), surge started CD18 (late) and is over now, just a faint LH line.  I have no temp rise at all.  We must have BD'd 10 times or more, since the LH faint line appeared so early (I track that too in FF).  

I'm honestly so defeated.  I know it hasn't been that many tries, but in the last 5 cycles, I had one normal one? And those 5 cycles took almost 9 months! 

I took the miscarriage way harder than I thought, and the whole experience has been really terrible.

I want to make an appointment with my (family) doctor and ask for a full panel for PCOS/thyroid/prolactin, but she was really unwilling the last time I asked and now I feel like the excuse will be the miscarriage messing up my hormones rather than the birth control.  

The wonderful OB said I could come back to her in 6 months if we haven't conceived and she'll get me started with all the testing... that'll be November if I'm really pushing it to be as early as possible.  I'm so sick of this and don't want to keep doing this only to find out we never had a chance! 

I feel like if I'd never gotten pregnant and miscarried, the doctor would be doing an investigation into my wonky cycles by now 😔

What would you do?  Wait a cycle? Try to get testing for the upcoming cycle? Wait until November for the OB?  There are so many options and I just don't know what to do anymore! I'm not sure about the vitex anymore... One great experience and then one not good one, hard to decide if it was good, bad or neutral...

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

Three weeks ago tomorrow I strapped my 2 year old son into his car seat and met my husband at the radiology clinic for my routine 20 week anatomy scan. I had no reason to believe anything was wrong. Other than the common difficulties I'd had in my previous pregnancy (intense morning sickness and GD), everything seemed pretty normal. 

In some ways I couldn't believe our incredible luck because the timing worked out perfectly for me to tell all 4 of my brothers I was pregnant in person at the end of the first trimester, and then we would be having a beach vacation and family reunion just a few weeks after the anatomy scan. In addition to that, my husband's sister was due with her first baby only 2 months before us, and a friend of mine from a hobby group was due with her first only 3 days before me. I fantasized about my son snuggling his baby sibling, our new baby having a cousin close in age to grow up with, and maybe becoming better friends with the woman from the hobby group as our babies rolled around on the floor together. I somehow managed to keep the secret all summer. Our tickets were booked, our swimsuits were bought and I looked forward to cruising through the rest of my second trimester and enjoying our last few months as a family of three.  

I guess the tech had a good poker face. I could hardly believe my ears when she said she thought it was a girl, and my husband and I started joking about how gaga our families would be over the first girl born on either side in 30 years. I wondered if I could honor my mother with her name, since my mom died two years ago and had longed for another baby girl for so long. The tech gave us the grand tour of baby anatomy: hands, feet, her sweet little face. She looked perfect, just like her older brother. The tech cooed over our baby's features as she took a few 3D keepsake shots, gave us our CD, and then left to get the doctor because she ""likes to see things for herself."" We expected the doctor would give the baby a quick once-over and then we'd be on our way to plan the rest of our summer. After a wait that felt like forever, the doctor came in and started scanning. We again joked about how creepy baby faces looked and the doctor laughed along with us. And that's about where my dream pregnancy turned into a nightmare.  

The doctor said there was something wrong with her heart. On the ultrasound she pointed out how the heart was pressed up against our baby's ribs, possibly because there was a mass in her chest pushing it out of position or that she had a hernia in her diaphragm. She told us she would report the results to my Ob and that I would need to see a specialist and that my Ob would call me with further instructions. She tried to reassure me in a chipper voice that it could be nothing! That maybe my very wiggly, tap dancing baby was playing tricks and making it hard to figure out what was going on.  

I got dressed in a dumbfounded silence. My husband and I carried our toddler to my car and kissed goodbye and I tried bringing my toddler to a local play place so he could run around while I figured out what we were up against. Although the doctor didn't make any specific diagnoses, I managed to piece together what she meant and started tapping out ""Fetus... diaphragm... hernia"" in Google on my phone. I felt a pit open up in my stomach as my eyes ran over the mortality rates. Fifty to eighty percent. I couldn't stay there in that play place with the pregnant moms and the moms with fresh-faced babes and so within 10 minutes I was dragging my kicking and screaming toddler out to the car so I could panic in the privacy of my own home.  

The next day my Ob's nurse called me and let me know she was faxing my information over to the MFM practice they use. Like the doctor at the radiology clinic she tried to reassure me that just because they were sending me there didn't mean something was wrong! And like a fool I let myself believe it. I DID just have a very wiggly, active baby. She was stubborn just like her mother, just like her mother's mother, and everything was going to be okay. The MFM clinic got me in for an ultrasound the next day (two days after our disastrous anatomy scan) and I told myself not to freak out just yet as I reviewed her ultrasound pictures on the CD I received.  

The second ultrasound came and I went alone while my husband watched our son. I was again treated to a grand tour of baby anatomy, but this time there was no joy. Only fear. The tech at the MFM practice showed me her hands, her mouth, her profile. ""Here's baby's hands... her are her feet..."" She spent an agonizing two hours running the ultrasound wand over my stomach while I could hardly bear to look at the screen, because even my untrained eyes could see the defect in question was still there: a perfect, beating heart, pressed too close to her ribs. The tech emailed me some select shots of the baby. Then the perinatalogist came in, gave me instructions on controlling my gestational diabetes (thanks but I have it under control), commented on how my baby girl would have a ""strong big brother to take care of her,"" and then scanned me for another grueling hour. It was torturous waiting for him to give me more detailed news while feeling like I couldn't enjoy or get attached to a baby who was probably going to die. I silently begged my baby to be okay, that this was just a fluke, that something was read wrong. Then the doctor finally finished scanning and dropped the bombshell I'd been dreading: my baby had Congenital Diaphragmatic Hernia.  

He suggested amniocentesis to rule out chromosomal abnormalities and I agreed, thinking we'd set it up in a few days... until an ultrasound tech wheeled a cart into the room. As they spread iodine solution on my belly and the ultrasound tech figured out the best place to stab a needle through my abdomen, she happily chirped, ""Do you know what you're having?!"" and I replied, ""... I don't know that it matters at this point."" Finally, 5 hours after arriving at the hospital, I was able to go home to tell my husband the news that our baby girl was seriously sick.  

The next two weeks were a blur. In the first week I joined as many support groups I could find for CDH and devoured survivor stories. I wanted to believe there was hope for our baby girl. I was barraged with Facebook friend requests from strangers who wanted to introduce their CDH survivors. I tried readjusting my vision for the birth of my second child... maybe she wouldn't be rooming in and meeting her big brother at the hospital but we could handle a NICU stay and bring home a healthy baby, right? We were within a reasonable distance of two great hospitals. Maybe a relative could stay with us and help care for my son while we waited for our baby to come home. We could do this. Results trickled in from the amniocentesis showing there were no chromosomal abnormalities and the perinatalogist who first made the diagnosis said her lungs looked ""pretty good."" I clung to hope and waited for my next appointment, a fetal echocardiogram set just over a week out from the first MFM appointment.  

Although I read so many survivor stories and clung to hope, I couldn't ignore the less optimistic survivor stories or the medical literature. I learned the numbers and measurements taken to determine between mild or moderate or severe prognoses. Babies with a mild prognosis might go home after 4-6 weeks in the NICU, but babies with a severe prognosis (liver in the chest and poor lung development) didn't fare so well. Babies with a severe prognosis were more likely to need to be put on machines to breathe for them immediately after birth, which required sedation. If they survived that, then they had to survive surgery to move all of their organs back into place. And if they survived that, they would need to survive being weaned from ventilators. Many babies were too fragile to even stroke for the first several weeks, let alone hold. Most had horrible reflux and often needed drugs or surgery to help with it. Many were too weak to eat AND breathe at the same time, so they had to be fed through tubes or needed a feeding tube implanted directly into their stomach. They needed tracheostomies for extended ventilator support. They developed oral aversions from the trauma of being intubated. They had to be weaned off of pain medications. And they experienced extensive developmental delays from all the months of being hooked up to the machines that kept them alive, but prevented them from doing normal baby things. And those interventions didn't necessarily end at the hospital, as sometimes these babies needed to go home on one or more interventions (trach tube, feeding tube, supplemental oxygen, etc.) to keep them alive. If they lived in the first place. In the support groups I joined, they liked to remind parents that sometimes babies with bad prognoses live and go on to lead very normal lives and that sometimes babies with good prognoses die and that you never knew how a baby would do until they were born! But the medical literature did not lie: babies with a worse prognosis were at higher risk of death and long term complications.  

I had to honestly ask myself... yes, there was a chance we could end up with a perfectly healthy, happy child after a rough couple of years. But would our family survive having a medically complex child? A child with a G tube, a child with a tracheostomy, a child who needed in-home nursing care? We already had an autistic child and, while I love him more than anything else in the entire world, I felt like I already struggled to get him to therapy appointments and out of the house for enriching activities. If I then added a second child who needed 10x the therapy and intervention, where even catching the common cold could land her in the PICU, would I ever see the sun again? And would splitting my time between my developmentally delayed son and a fragile baby in the NICU over an hour away for months during a critical period of my son's development set him back for the rest of his life?   

I thought back to the birth of my son and how comforted he was just to be in our arms. What does a newborn want? To be cuddled by her family, to have a full belly, to sleep soundly in the crook of her parents' arms. What did I see when I looked through photos of babies in the NICU with CDH? I saw babies who were whisked away to be intubated as soon as they were born, babies who couldn't be held for weeks or months. Babies with tape on their faces and tubes coming out of their chests and mouths and babies who lived and died with their blood coursing through machines, never knowing their mother's touch until their life support was withdrawn. While I will never, ever criticize anyone who knows the odds are slim and chooses hope anyway, my husband and I decided that if our baby had a severe prognosis that we would not be willing to risk putting her through that in the hopes that we would have a miracle baby who defied the odds.  

With those guidelines in mind, we went to our fetal echocardiogram to find out if we were dealing with a mild, moderate, or severe prognosis. Everything was downhill from there. While our baby's heart was normal, her liver and gallbladder had migrated well into her thoracic cavity. The MFM could not see her left lung, and her ""lung to head ratio"" for her remaining lung measured at 0.88, where less than 1.0 is classified as ""severe"" for CDH babies. Fluid was starting to collect in her chest cavity around her lungs, meaning there was a chance she would develop fetal hydrops and either die in utero or have to be delivered prematurely. From there we scheduled two appointments: a Hail Mary consultation at a top ranked children's hospital, complete with a fetal MRI for a definitive prognosis, and a terminat!on a few days later. If we got a dramatically more optimistic prognosis after the consultation, we could always cancel the terminat!on.  

But as we sat down with the fetal medicine experts after my MRI and an additional ultrasound, I saw the numbers scribbled on a sheet of paper and I knew it was over. Her prognosis was even worse. Before I wasn't sure if she had a left lung that was just obscured by her liver, but according to the MRI our baby girl had ""no measurable amount of left lung."" The right lung was 13% of the size it should have been for her gestational age. Our baby only had a tiny fraction of one lung to survive on. Half of her liver was in her chest, and now there was fluid collecting in both her chest and abdominal cavities. We were not going to have a miracle baby.  

We spent one more day free of appointments with her. My husband's parents watched our son while my husband and I ate one last, nice meal together before we prepared for the terminat!on. I tried not to think about my baby's kicks too much. Every doctor and tech we encountered described how much she liked to move and I tried not to think about how my feisty daughter would never see the light of day.  

I had my pre-op appointment where the laminaria were inserted. The shots to my cervix were by far the most physically painful part of the D&E process. The D&E happened the next morning but didn't go smoothly, since I hemorrhaged during the operation and eventually needed to get a blood transfusion, but we managed to make it home on the same day.  

Now there is nothing to do but heal from the physical consequences of surgery and process the shock. I was pregnant 2 days ago, and now my belly looks sad an empty. I know that we made the right choice for our daughter and for our family, but three weeks ago we were planning the rest of our lives and now I'm looking at beach photos posted by my extended family while I sit at home, grieving. I miss my baby and wish I had more time with her, but I know that delaying the procedure meant she would only develop more capacity to suffer. Her ultrasound photos, my pregnancy tests and her footprints are all stashed away in my desk, waiting for us to find an appropriate memory box to house them in forever.  

We decided to name her Fiona. It would not have been my first choice of name, but when I was a teenager my mom told me she had a dream where she had a second daughter that she named Fiona. I was horrified in the moment because I already had sooo many siblings, and the thought of having a sibling 16 years my junior was unthinkable, but my mom never forgot that dream and teased me about having a Baby Fiona for years. I am not religious, but part of me hopes that somewhere, this name has led my baby girl to my mother.

While I haven't posted to this group, reading all of your posts has given me encouragement as well as help me to process all of this. As an introduction, I began having brown spotting 2 days before my MC, but I only had some brown spotting. I woke up on the 31st to brown and red spotting with some cramping. I called the clinic and they suggested I come in just to make sure everything was okay. 

&#x200B;

I should have been 13+4 at that point but when my husband went into the clinic, they didn't find a heartbeat and my baby was measuring 10 weeks. We were obviously devastated - we had a great US at 9+4 and made an announcement around 12 weeks, I was still having pregnancy symptoms throughout all of this. That day was the worst day physically and emotionally that I have ever had, it was traumatic for both me and my husband. We were so excited to have this baby - both of my sister-in-laws are due with their first in October and we were looking forward to having children close in age.  Fortunately my husband and I were both able to take some time off of work to grieve and process. 

&#x200B;

Almost 2 weeks after my MC, I physically feel well and emotionally feel ready to begin to TTC again. I have had brown spotting since last week Wednesday (1 week from MC) but no red at all. I had blood work taken that day, and my HCg level was 52. I decided to take an ovulation test (clear blue digital) yesterday which was negative - I was a little sad but I wasn't surprised. Today I noticed some cramping on my left side, similar to ovulation pain I had when we were TTC before I got pregnant. I took another ovulation test and it was a blinking smiley face! Counting 7/31 as CD1, this would be CD 12 which is around when I normally begin to get high level tests. 

&#x200B;

My husband and I haven't had sex yet since the MC, I wasn't sure if we should still refrain with brown spotting even though I know this is old blood. I'm so worried about a possible infection. I would be inclined to think that the positive ovulation test was due to HCg interference; however, I think that yesterday's should have been positive as well. I have another blood draw on Tuesday but if I really am beginning to ovulate I want to take advantage of that!

Today is my cousins baby shower, she’s having a girl. While I’m super excited for her, I’m feeling super anxious about going. I had my MC @ 6 weeks (I missed her gender reveal because I was miscarrying) about two months ago. I was, at first, super excited about going....but now it’s really starting to make me emotional because now I’m just thinking that i may never get to have my own baby shower and I really just don’t want to go anymore. I will also feel really bad if I miss the baby shower. 

Does anyone have any advice on how to handle a baby shower? I really want to go for like an hour or so then leave, but I don’t know if I’ll be able to handle it.

53,2048,confidence,<praw.reddit.Reddit object at 0x7f12a630cd90>,,ttcafterloss,"Hi everyone, I've been frequenting this subreddit obsessively over the past week. I finally feel ready to introduce myself, so here it goes. 

I found out last week I had a missed miscarriage. I had light spotting one morning and took no chances - I went straight to the ER. At this point I had very mild pregnancy symptoms. Deep, deep down somewhere in the corner of my mind, I didn't feel pregnant anymore. I was anxious to find out if it's my imagination playing with me, or if my worst fear would come true.

I was supposed to be measuring at 10 weeks, so at the ER they tried doing an abdominal ultrasound since the fetus might be big enough to be detected. No luck. They ordered a transvaginal ultrasound instead, which took about 30 minutes to set up. Those were the longest minutes in my life. 

During the transvaginal ultrasound, I couldn't see the screen from my bed. I asked the technician if she could walk me through what's happening, but she said she wasn't allowed to. The final report had to come from the doctor. So all throughout, I'm trying to read her poker face and do my best to listen to what's going on. For a short second, I hear a heartbeat. I'm asked to hold my breath, twice. All we hear is the buzzing of the fluorescent lightbulbs and whirring of the ultrasound machine. At this point, I haven't processed what's going on. I thought the initial heartbeat was the baby's. Reflecting back, it was mine - slow and deeper than a fetus. She takes many images of the fetus with the wand deep inside me. It's so painful and I cry. 

When it's over, I get up and have a quick glance of the screen with images of the baby at various angles. It's there! There's my baby!!! I'm so relieved and at this point, optimistic. The technician didn't have a negative, sympathetic expression on her face, so I assumed all was good. However, at one point, she did ask me if I came here alone, and if I had anyone to go home with after this. I thought she was just striking up conversation for distraction, but that may have been a hint that I may walk out of here shattered, my life changed forever. 

My blood results come back, and my hcg level is at 15,000, which the doctor said is an unreliable indicator for anything. He finally has the final results to report. They couldn't detect a heartbeat. The fetus was measuring small, and it stopped growing at 7w5d. I've been carrying it for 2 weeks, and the doctor said I can continue waiting it out for 1 more week. I can decide on my options when I see my OB at my next appointment.

All throughout, I was numb. The doctor continued talking to me, and I was fully concentrated on what he was saying. I asked all the necessary questions. I felt like I was in a business meeting. I felt like a third party witness, experiencing something outside of my own body. It wasn't happening to me, we are talking about another patient in the room. I came home, called my husband (who was on a business trip) and asked him to come home. When he finally did, I felt like myself. I softened up, got emotional, and cried. 

Two days passed since the ER, and I felt uncomfortable with the concept of carrying my dead baby inside me. Every morning I'd wake up and look at my bump progress, and now I felt foolish. My body was tricking me all this time. My boobs still hurt so much. I still felt fatigued.  I scheduled a phone appointment with my OB that day, and she prescribed misoprostol. I picked it up at the pharmacy right away, along with hydrocodone for the pain.

&#x200B;

**My misoprostol experience:** 

Right before taking the pills, I wrote a letter to my baby as a way to dump my feelings and find the strength to do this. It took about 5 minutes to compose myself in the bathroom. I had to insert pills into my vagina to get rid of my baby. It was hard enough to hear that my baby died, but now I had to get rid of it myself. I never imagined I'd be doing this. But here I was, shaking and anxious, saying goodbye to my baby as I inserted the pills vaginally. It was heartbreaking.

I took the 4 misoprostol pills 11pm. I chose the night time to do this because there was something more comforting about going through a bad experience when it's dark than experiencing it during the day. I thought I could sleep through it too. Boy, I was wrong.

I felt it dissolve 30 minutes later and had mild, tingling pulses in my uterus. 1 hour later, I had an urge to pee and the bleeding started when I wiped. One of the pills also dropped into the toilet. Whatever, fuck it. In the next 4 hours, I felt the contractions. They were the worst pain I've experienced in my life. It felt like someone was ripping apart my uterus with their bare hands. I didn't take the hydrocodone for pain - I felt more afraid of the opiates believe it or not. I didn't want to feel drowsy or completely numb to my pain. I wanted to be alert and in control of my body. Instead, I took over-the-counter Motrin, which only helped slightly. 

I vomited and had diarrhea. I felt so much better after that. I knocked out around 4am with a heat pad on my back. For the next 3 days, I still experienced heavy cramps and was on Motrin the whole time. 

Today is my 6th day after misoprostol. I'm still bleeding and get mild cramps. I want it to be over so bad. I can't predict when it will end though. Some days I don't have any blood on my pad, other days it gushes out. 

**Right now:** 

I'm still mostly numb. I did emotionally prepare for worst case scenarios while I was pregnant, especially since I had mild symptoms. But I never knew I'd be part of the miscarriage statistics. Why me? Why my first pregnancy? Why is this process so drawn out in the first place? 9 months to get pregnant? Months to heal over a miscarriage??? I'm feeling angry and bitter. I'm triggered by baby-related songs and pictures and strollers on the street. I break down when I look at my baby's ultrasound images I got on my 6th week. 

I'm still so, so, so hopeful that I'll get pregnant after this miscarriage. But I wish I could fast forward time to when this damn bleeding would stop and I can start getting my periods, tracking my ovulation, that whole business all over again. 

Anything is better than living day by day, continuously expelling the remains of what I hoped would be my first child, my happiness, my future.",t2_3yfd2jas,False,,0,False,My Introduction,[],r/ttcafterloss,False,0,intro,0,,,False,t3_coz8st,False,dark,1.0,,public,27,0,{},,,False,[],,False,False,,{},Intro,False,27,,False,self,False,,[],{},,True,,1565571738.0,text,0,,,text,self.ttcafterloss,True,"<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=""md""><p>Hi everyone, I&#39;ve been frequenting this subreddit obsessively over the past week.

<p><strong>My misoprostol experience:</strong> </p>

<p>Right before taking the pills, I wrote a letter to my baby as a way to dump my feelings and find the strength to do this. It took about 5 minutes to compose myself in the bathroom. I had to insert pills into my vagina to get rid of my baby. It was hard enough to hear that my baby died, but now I had to get rid of it myself. I never imagined I&#39;d be doing this. But here I was, shaking and anxious, saying goodbye to my baby as I inserted the pills vaginally. It was heartbreaking.</p>

<p>I took the 4 misoprostol pills 11pm. I chose the night time to do this because there was something more comforting about going through a bad experience when it&#39;s dark than experiencing it during the day. I thought I could sleep through it too. Boy, I was wrong.</p>

<p>I felt it dissolve 30 minutes later and had mild, tingling pulses in my uterus. 1 hour later, I had an urge to pee and the bleeding started when I wiped. One of the pills also dropped into the toilet. Whatever, fuck it. In the next 4 hours, I felt the contractions. They were the worst pain I&#39;ve experienced in my life. It felt like someone was ripping apart my uterus with their bare hands. I didn&#39;t take the hydrocodone for pain - I felt more afraid of the opiates believe it or not. I didn&#39;t want to feel drowsy or completely numb to my pain. I wanted to be alert and in control of my body. Instead, I took over-the-counter Motrin, which only helped slightly. </p>

<p>I vomited and had diarrhea. I felt so much better after that. I knocked out around 4am with a heat pad on my back. For the next 3 days, I still experienced heavy cramps and was on Motrin the whole time. </p>

<p>Today is my 6th day after misoprostol. I&#39;m still bleeding and get mild cramps. I want it to be over so bad. I can&#39;t predict when it will end though. Some days I don&#39;t have any blood on my pad, other days it gushes out. </p>

<p><strong>Right now:</strong> </p>

<p>I&#39;m still mostly numb. I did emotionally prepare for worst case scenarios while I was pregnant, especially since I had mild symptoms. But I never knew I&#39;d be part of the miscarriage statistics. Why me? Why my first pregnancy? Why is this process so drawn out in the first place? 9 months to get pregnant? Months to heal over a miscarriage??? I&#39;m feeling angry and bitter. I&#39;m triggered by baby-related songs and pictures and strollers on the street. I break down when I look at my baby&#39;s ultrasound images I got on my 6th week. </p>

<p>I&#39;m still so, so, so hopeful that I&#39;ll get pregnant after this miscarriage. But I wish I could fast forward time to when this damn bleeding would stop and I can start getting my periods, tracking my ovulation, that whole business all over again. </p>

<p>Anything is better than living day by day, continuously expelling the remains of what I hoped would be my first child, my happiness, my future.</p>

I had a MMC  on 7/7 at 10 weeks. Baby died at 6 weeks.  Ended up miscarrying naturally 3 days before my D&C after waiting 2.5 weeks for the sac to stop growing and get booked in for the D&C. 

My HCG went down pretty slow but it got low enough 12 days ago for my body to try to ovulate. I was tracking with OPKs and had EWCM for a few days before ovulation along with feeling in the mood. Im not 100% i ovulated then, as i got a second positive OPK 2 days later  and had mild ovulation pain both times. I usually have irregularish periods, but this would have put me at about a 35/38 day cycle which has been pretty normal for me since giving birth in 2018. 

I usually have around 14-15 day luteal phase but if my ovulation is right I started CD1 at 9DPO or 12DPO. Bit disappointing as we were trying again this cycle, 9DPO seems very short. 

Are there many others who have experienced a shorter LP that first cycle after miscarriage? I'm going to start taking vitex again from today to try and help balance my hormones again but just wondered how common this might be?

The practice is headed by two MFMs. For some reason I thought every OB in the practice was an MFM but it looks like the others are just OBGYNs. The OB I was assigned to is super nice. Patient, explains things well. Quickly responsive to emails through the patient portal, will even call sometimes. I like her.
I had two pregnancies with two early losses and two d&cs with her. She has gone over my chart and medication list with me several times.

After my recent loss, I did some reading about hypothyroid management in pregnancy. What I read was backed up by the RE we just saw. 
Basically, for women who are already on thyroid medication, the standard recommended practice is to test the thyroid levels pre-conception, titrate the dose of meds until the thyroid is a certain number. Then, as soon as you have a positive pregnancy test, increase the dose of medication by a certain percent, and frequently test the thyroid levels in the early weeks. Like, test it by 4 weeks pregnant. And make sure the numbers stay within a certain small range. 

My doctor did none of this. She ordered a thyroid test along with all the other first trimester blood tests when I went for my official first appointment at 9+5 weeks. We found no heartbeat, so those bloods never happened. But she completely neglected to test my thyroid before then or tell me to raise my dose when I got pregnant either time. I asked the RE if this was something an OB should know, or if it was advanced endocrinology or something, and asked if should I be concerned. He said that she should have known and he would be concerned. He also said it’s very unlikely to have caused my miscarriages, unless my thyroid levels were sky-high. But it definitely makes me not trust the OB.

I also found out from the nurse after my D&C that my OB is the newest and has only been there a year. According to the hospital’s website, she isn’t board-certified whereas the others are. (I’m guessing she takes boards this year or something).

Anyway, I have my two week post d&c follow up with her next week. I’d like to bring this up, so she knows for future patients. And also just to get an explanation? Or should I report it to someone? I mean, it (probably) didn’t cause me harm. But it still seems important for someone to know about.

But I don’t know how. I hate conflict. I also know that doctors can’t know everything, and everyone makes mistakes. But still - I feel like my care wasn’t managed properly.

Next pregnancy, I will likely stay with this practice but request a different doctor. So I may still see my OB - potentially even be delivered by her! So I don’t want to piss anyone off or be super accusatory. 

Help me find this balance? What would you do?

I’d also like to learn more about how the MFMs operate in the practice. Like, can one of them be my OB next time, or do they only consult?

Sat there chatting about the pregnancy for about an hour and a half before they did the actual exam. Midwife asked me if I noticed any spotting, uh, no, but her fingers were covered in brown discharge. 

So they scheduled us for an ultrasound yesterday. Turns out I was carrying twins and one stopped developing around 5w and the other at 6w. Went to chat with the midwife afterwards. I want things over and done with as soon as possible, mainly because I drive around for work and don't really need to experience an mc a couple hours from home. They were able to get a D&C scheduled for Thursday.

Now what I'm having trouble grasping is the fact I would like TTC again as soon as possible. As in Friday. I'm not sure what is going on with me as I managed to live nearly 37 and a half years not even sure I even wanted to have children and now that I knew I was pregnant for a mere month, I want it to be something that happens immediately.

I posted this in the chat over at r/Stilltrying but thought I might get advice here as well...

My bloodtest last week showed my hcg is down to 21 after being treated with methotrexate for an ectopic pregnancy after our IUI. Almost back to <5! We still have to wait 3 months before trying again and in the meantime we're going to check that my tubes are both still open so I have to call and set that up on the next Day 1. 

I've had the sonohysterogram with foam twice before but never an HSG. They're giving me a choice between the two but are kind of pushing the SHG with foam again. They only do HSGs once a week at the hospital but can do SHG any day at their clinic so I guess I'm worried their just pushing SHG for convenience? I also know that HSGs are supposed to be more painful, so maybe their recommending SHG because of that.

I know both tests will show if my tubes are open, but it seems to me that HSGs give a better image of the tube and I'm wondering isn't that important after having an ectopic? But I have no basis for thinking that other than images I've looked at online. Maybe the doctors can see the shape and any narrowing of the tube just fine with the SHG and it's just not as obvious to untrained eyes.

It took years, a failed IVF, and 6 IUIs to get pregnant so if the HSG could pick up any extra useful detail to prevent another ectopic, I'd rather go with that.

I've seen this topic discussed before, but I am keen for your advice. We've just hit a year of trying to TTC our second child, with a MMC at 8 weeks in May.

I've had very basic testing (bloods around CD 11-12, ultrasound a day later, progesterone at 7dpo), and seem to be ovulating properly. The only possible problem is I have a niche/defect on my caesarean scar, but given I got pregnant and the embryo implanted normally, it hopefully won't cause issues (my miscarriage was chromosomal).

Because of my normal test results, the fact I had a child 2.5 years ago (conceived naturally on cycle 8), and my miscarriage, my OB said we shouldn't have anything to worry about and should try for at least another 6 months before seeking further help.

What do you think? On one hand I'm disappointed, I always saw a year as a magic milestone where we would get some help. On the other hand, I don't want to rush into ART if we probably will be pregnant again naturally.

My dr said I could or could not, but I can’t figure how I’d have a period without ovulating first (unless my body is just totally in Wild Wild West mode...?) </p>

<p>Argh. Would love to hear your experiences 💛</p>

<p>She’s been so good at her job up to now, and this comment left me feeling totally deflated - like another part of me, my grief, the one thing I could own, can’t be mine either. I felt really alone. That I have no right to grieve for my lost pregnancy...</p>

I’m also going to call my OB for a consult. He told me to come in after 6 months with no luck. It’s been a little longer than that, but with my chemical I think it’s time.

TL:DR I want to get pregnant again after MC, DH not cooperating and I am getting frustrated by it.

Late last year I told DH I wanted to have a baby this year. He didn’t really reposed one way or the other but I proceeded with my plan in December because I was supposed to ovulate around Christmas so we did lots of BD while we were both off from work. Come January he was still on the fence about things until one day he told me he was ready to be a dad and even if it didn’t work out this time he wanted to really start trying.

That happened to be the same day I found out that I was pregnant. We got super excited and told our families and some co-workers within about a week. Had the first OB appointment just after 8 weeks and had to convince DH to go with me (he thought it would be weird if he did). There was a strong heartbeat but there was what looked like fluid on the chest so the doctor wanted me to come back in a week and see if they could get a better image when it was bigger but acted like it wasn’t a big deal.

The next week rolls around and I found out Monday that my grandpa had passed away. Went to the OB appointment on Friday and there was not longer a heartbeat, was only measuring about 2 days last the pervious US. We toon the weekend to think and I got the pills on Monday because I was over being pregnant. I wanted to get it over with so we could move on. Took the next two days off work and the one round of pills did their job so no further intervention was needed.

DH isn’t an emotional guy, we have been together almost 10 years and I’ve never seen him cry, but he took it hard. He was so excited then so crushed. I on the other hand just handle death weird, I was upset about it but also rationalized that it wouldn’t have come out healthy anyway so better to lose it at 9 weeks than much later. I still have only had about 1 weekend where it has really hit me hard up to this point.

I wanted to try again right away but knew he needed some time. I also had not desire to be due in February as my dad, both grandpas, and now my pregnancy all died during that month so I knew we would have to avoid trying in April. DH wanted to pull out every time until we were ready. The last two months I have really been trying to convince him to start trying again. He will agree to it but once my fertile window rolls around he changes his mind. He says I only want sex to get pregnant but it really is that my body really, really wants it when I’m fertile (biology is funny that way).

So this month rolls around and my fertile window gets close. I had EWCM a couple days before it was supposed to start so I told him that we needed to try that night or the next. The next night he stayed up to see me and BD so I thought he wanted to try. I should mention that we work opposite schedules, he works 11 pm to 8 ish am and I work 8 am to 5 pm so we really don’t have much chance to BD. Add to our already off schedules that his parent came to visit and he went to the casino Saturday night and his dad stayed with us Sunday night.

Today is when my tracking app says I should be ovulating and a lot of other things have been sucking in my personal life (cat isn’t eating, didn’t get a job that would have made me feel more financially ready for a baby, don’t really like my current job, not getting much sleep due to our puppy, etc.) I decided to leave work after about an hour to take a mental health day today. I figured that DH would be down for BD but I was completely wrong. He didn’t come within 5 feet of me it seemed like.

I am left feeling frustrated because it seems like he is just telling me we can try when he knows I’m not fertile. When we did BD he seemed to judge me for laying there a little longer to let things pool to increase my chances (can’t hurt right lol). I am trying to be sensitive to his feelings but I keep thinking about the study that found getting pregnant again within 6 months reduces chances of another miscarriage (I know there is still a chance but if I can reduce it even a little why not do it). I’m running out of time in that window.

I really just needed to vent. I don’t have anyone to really talk to about this stuff because people keep telling me I haven’t truly coped with the MC or they are people who aren’t ready for kids so don’t really understand. The MC sucked and I feel like people should let me cope how I want to cope with it, which is getting pregnant again and putting it behind me once and for all. When I try to talk to DH he kinda shuts down. I have already decided that when I do get pregnant again I will hide it from him as long as I can. I won’t outright lie to him, but I do plan to be evasive when answering questions. I can’t watch him go through that pain again. I would rather deal with a second MC in my own than have him suffer.

<p>Late last year I told DH I wanted to have a baby this year. He didn’t really reposed one way or the other but I proceeded with my plan in December because I was supposed to ovulate around Christmas so we did lots of BD while we were both off from work.

We are getting genetic testing on the tissue this time around, but I’m wondering what else I should be looking into. I know it could just be bad luck and nothing “wrong” but I’d rather be safe than sorry. I’m looking for pointers in terms of who to see next and what to ask for.

My history: 35, husband 37. I have 15+ tracked cycles and everything I track seems normal.
Both times we conceived on the second or third month of trying. No meds or fertility interventions.

First pregnancy last fall, I had spotting, so I had an ultrasound at 6 weeks. No fetal pole or heartbeat. Sac and yolk measured less than 5 weeks. Hcg continued to double well and spotting continued but did not get worse. 8 week ultrasound had a fetal pole measuring 6 weeks with no heartbeat. So, not a blighted ovum, but an early embryo not growing correctly and likely never had a heartbeat. D&C was uneventful, and I got my period a month later.

This pregnancy, I had early beta hcg drawn three times and they looked great. High side for doubling time, high numbers correlated with good outcomes in several studies.

I had early spotting and had an ultrasound at 6 weeks, 4 days. Embryo measured 6 weeks, 2 days (within the realm of normal) and had a strong  heartbeat of 120! No evidence of bleeding in the uterus so doc and I believe it was just a friable cervix. Spotting stopped shortly after. I also had nausea and vomiting this pregnancy. Today at 9 weeks 5 days, there was no heartbeat and the embryo measured only 6 weeks and was not shaped well anymore- likely already partially reabsorbed by my body. Doctor said it probably died right after the last ultrasound.

<p>When pregnant I was so tired that every once in a while I would do a brief prenatal yoga video and that was kind of it.</p>

<p>Now I probably have a few months to go before I can ttc and I’m bummed about the extra five lbs that is hanging around. </p>

<p>Problem is I’m unmotivated to exercise other than talking my dog for long walks, which is good but not making much of a difference for me fitness-wise.</p>

<p>For those who struggled to get back to your routine - any tips? </p>

<p>I think part of the problem for me is I really resent the cause of my weight gain. This is the heaviest I’ve been (not-pregnant) and it’s pissing me off.</p>
