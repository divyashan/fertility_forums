I'm recovering from my second consecutive miscarriage, and being a data-driven person and someone looking for comfort, I've been trying to get my head around the statistics here. I've heard and read some misleading information, so I just wanted to clear up a few things that I've been thinking about lately. (But! As with all data found on the internet, who knows if it's 100% accurate...)

Most folks have heard that about 20% of pregnancies end in miscarriage (may be much higher including CPs that ladies didn't recognize). The stats generally go on to say that 5% of women go on to have a second MC, and 1% have another after that. (source: [MayoClinic!](http://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-lifestyle/getting-pregnant/in-depth/pregnancy-after-miscarriage/art-20044134): *""Miscarriage is usually a one-time occurrence. Most women who miscarry go on to have a healthy pregnancy after miscarriage. Less than 5 percent of women have two consecutive miscarriages, and only 1 percent have three or more consecutive miscarriages.""*). However, this means 5% and 1% of the TOTAL, not 5% and 1% of women who've *already had* an MC.

So some people are like ""hey, i had one miscarriage, so there's only a 5% chance that I'll have another!"" But no, that's not it. Luckily, the truth isn't so bad:

Let's say there are 100 women who get pregnant.  

Let's say 80 of them have babies, and 20 miscarry.

Of that 20, 5 will miscarry again next time (2 MCs total).

Of that 5, 1 will miscarry again next time (3 MCs total).

(20%, 5%, 1%)

SO! Since ~20 out of 100 is ~20%, and 5 out of 20 is 25%, and 1 out of 5 is 20%, **EACH MC UP TO 3 MC's has nearly the same rate/risk of MC as the first one!!!** For some reason this really helped me.

I've posted here before because I thought I was ovulating after experiencing the loss of my little ones. I have come to the conclusion that this was probably an anovulatory cycle as it has now been six weeks since my loss and there is still no sign of AF. 


My partner and I have decided to give our little ones real names instead of nicknames. Seeing as we were so early on when the loss occurred we have gone with the unisex names, Auburn and River. I feel like by giving our little ones names we have made the experience more real, and therefore there is more closure. I have decided I would like to get a tattoo in remembrance of them, and was wondering if anyone had any ideas? I'm thinking of something approximately the size of a bank card, to go on the inner side of the top of my arm, most likely in black and grey. 


I guess the last thing that I'm looking for advice on is how everyone else is going about TTC. My partner and I got pregnant with our twins in our second cycle, but I wasn't temping, charting or using OPKs, just checking cervical position once a day. Are you following a strict schedule? Or do you prefer to leave things relaxed? I've heard some mixed opinions on Vitex for regulating menstrual cycles, as I have a somewhat irregular cycle. Have you tried Vitex? If so, what did it do for you?

<p>I&#39;ve posted here before because I thought I was ovulating after experiencing the loss of my little ones. I have come to the conclusion that this was probably an anovulatory cycle as it has now been six weeks since my loss and there is still no sign of AF. </p>

<p>My partner and I have decided to give our little ones real names instead of nicknames. Seeing as we were so early on when the loss occurred we have gone with the unisex names, Auburn and River. I feel like by giving our little ones names we have made the experience more real, and therefore there is more closure. I have decided I would like to get a tattoo in remembrance of them, and was wondering if anyone had any ideas? I&#39;m thinking of something approximately the size of a bank card, to go on the inner side of the top of my arm, most likely in black and grey. </p>

<p>I guess the last thing that I&#39;m looking for advice on is how everyone else is going about TTC. My partner and I got pregnant with our twins in our second cycle, but I wasn&#39;t temping, charting or using OPKs, just checking cervical position once a day. Are you following a strict schedule? Or do you prefer to leave things relaxed? I&#39;ve heard some mixed opinions on Vitex for regulating menstrual cycles, as I have a somewhat irregular cycle. Have you tried Vitex? If so, what did it do for you?</p>

<p>Sorry for the long, ranty and question-filled post. I just wanted to update the community a little because in my time here I have always been treated with respect, kindness and honesty, which I am so thankful for. So thanks guys, it means a lot :)</p>

Occasionally, someone gets a weird-looking Wondfo package and isn't sure why they ""changed"". Well, they didn't change -- but there are other manufacturers out there who make counterfeit Wondfo products, and some unscrupulous sellers on Amazon will send you counterfeit goods. (Why? Money, presumably.)

There has been, periodically, some discussion/confusion over how to tell which ones are ""real"", and which ones are ""fake"". Today, I finally unearthed a definitive answer from the manufacturer, which states explicitly that they do not vary their packaging or test appearance, and wanted to share my findings with you all.

OPK: http://wondfousa.com/test/ovulation-tests/

OPK packages should be blue, with the word ""Wondfo"" in the drop logo, NOT ""LH"". The OPK strips themselves should have a BLUE handle, not green, with the letters ""LH"" in darker blue.

HPT: http://wondfousa.com/test/pregnancy-tests/

HPT packages should be pink, with the word ""Wondfo"" in the drop logo, NOT ""HCG"". The HPT strips themselves should have a PINK handle, not blue, with the letters ""HCG"" in red.

If you receive counterfeit Wondfo tests, alert Amazon customer service and they'll make it right.

To avoid counterfeit Wondfo tests, note that their authorized sellers are iFast, Ding!, TEST `A-SURE, Easy@Home, IN-N-OUT, USHealth Tests and Products, Formosa Medical LLC, and Fairview Mart.

Note that some people still receive good results from the counterfeit strips, but there's no way to tell what sort of quality control the counterfeit strips have been subject to (if any) and there's no manufacturer willing to stand behind the results you receive.

This last week has been incredible, unbelievable, wrenching. I tested positive at 11DPO (Friday, only 6 days ago?!), again for 3 days after that, and then on Wednesday afternoon I started to bleed, hard.

I guess I had always been nervous about this pregnancy, partly because everything was falling into place: it was only cycle 2 TTC, my dad's birthday and his grandfather's visit both fell on a week that we were planning to tell our families, the due date was great for our work schedules. And, most of all, starting a few days before my BFP, I had a mysterious pain in my right pelvis that felt a lot like ovulation pain. This is why I kept POAS for so many days--just to see the line get darker.

It turned out the right pelvic pain may have been a clue as to the cause. I went to the ER almost as soon as I saw the blood, where I got a urine test, bloodwork, and an transvaginal ultrasound. Negative urine test. hCG of 9. NINE! And the US pointed to the possible cause: a leiomyoma (fibroid) on the right side. I had ovulated on the right, and there was evidence that the fibroid may have been the site of implantation.

At the time we had scheduled a first appointment with an OB that wasn't close to where I work, so I called an OB near me and they sent me to the ER. I have a followup appointment with our original OB in two weeks, and I have a million questions that are just going to plague us until we see the new OB. The ED doc didn't have a lot to tell us. So I thought I'd ask my questions here.

First, has anyone experienced a miscarriage caused by implantation on a leiomyoma?

Does anyone know whether a leiomyoma can cause problems with pregnancy later on, even if it's not the site of implantation? 

Do you have any, any, any advice!? Anything we should prepare ourselves for in terms of further diagnoses?

Right now I'm waiting out the bleeding and exploring the wikis here. Since yesterday afternoon I've been resting and my husband has been working from home. I'm hoping my cycle gets right back on track so we can start trying again. I got back into a regular cycle immediately coming off the BCP, so I'm hopeful for that.

I have a followup appointment with our original OB in two weeks, and I have a million questions that are just going to plague us until we see the new OB. The ED doc didn&#39;t have a lot to tell us. So I thought I&#39;d ask my questions here.</p>

<p>First, has anyone experienced a miscarriage caused by implantation on a leiomyoma?</p>

<p>Does anyone know whether a leiomyoma can cause problems with pregnancy later on, even if it&#39;s not the site of implantation? </p>

<p>Do you have any, any, any advice!? Anything we should prepare ourselves for in terms of further diagnoses?</p>

<p>Right now I&#39;m waiting out the bleeding and exploring the wikis here. Since yesterday afternoon I&#39;ve been resting and my husband has been working from home. I&#39;m hoping my cycle gets right back on track so we can start trying again. I got back into a regular cycle immediately coming off the BCP, so I&#39;m hopeful for that. I&#39;m terrified that this cycle of MCs will continue.</p>

I've made this alternate account for baby stuff only because I have friends who see my posts on my main. You may or may not recognise info from my main account and that's totally fine; just trying to prevent family from finding out early when the time comes. :)

I'm going to try to give a quick rundown of my cycles since the MC to set up my question:

FEB 10-28 - Complete MC (2days spotting, 11days normal bleeding, 6days spotting)

MAR 21-28 - 20 days later (6days bleeding, 2days spotting)

APR 19-25 - 21 days later (5days bleeding, 2days spotting)

MAY 19-25 - 23 days later (5days bleeding, 2days spotting)

JUN 18-23 - 23 days later (4days bleeding, 2 days spotting)

TODAY - 29 days and counting

Despite having a MC, my cycles jumped back quickly and look pretty consistent. I know I'm still in a recovery stage technically as a MC may change what is considered normal for my cycles, but they seem to not have been affected much.

Now for my inquiry: my gut instinct is that I'm not pregnant (mostly because I don't quite want to be; I planned to start trying again next month), but I can't help feeling like I'm spotting symptoms like crazy. AF is about 5/6 days late and I'm experiencing cramping (for 3 days or so) with a brief period of more painful cramps this morning. Last night I was experiencing a crazy amount of very white, very thick CM. This morning there was less CM and some tinted pink. I've also been experiencing horrible constipation today and yesterday (never ever ever happens to me!). I ended up taking a test this morning after seeing the pink CM, but I got a BFN 

Does anyone have any similar experiences or opinions about my info?

* [Whole30](http://whole30.com/whole30-program-rules/)
* [A 30 Day Fitness Challenge](http://30dayfitnesschallenges.com/)
* Keep a thought journal for a month
* Write down your dreams for 30 days

* Learn a new skill (even if it's small) every day 
* Write a letter (by hand) to someone daily
* Say only positive things to/about your SO, no complaining

Anyway, there's a ton of room for creativity. You can pick something from this list or come up with your own.
