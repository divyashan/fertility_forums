After suffering my third loss (1st blighted ovum, 2nd Triploidy, 3rd chemical pregnancy), I pushed for testing. My doctor ordered a slew of blood tests for me and I had what seemed to be 273 tubes of blood taken. I don't go back for my follow up until the 15th, but the results are slowly rolling in on my insurance page. Of course, most of the results are in medical jargon so I've been on a google frenzy every time a new result is available. So far everything has come back normal except for my MTHFR. 

This result states on my insurance page as follows:
""This individual is heterozygous for the A1298C
 variant and negative (normal) for the C677T
 variant in the MTHFR gene. This result is not
 associated with a significantly increased risk for
 coronary artery disease, venous thromboembolism,
 or adverse pregnancy outcome.""

However, upon doing some research and mass amounts of googling, I'm getting mixed information. Everything else I've read has either stated that people with this mutation may have recurrent pregnancy loss or that it is not known what effect this has on pregnancy. It's my understanding that women with this mutation mostly just take straight folate supplements, avoid folic acid, change their diet, take baby aspirin and sometimes lovenox. I'm not sure about my homocysteine levels, that will be something I will bring up to my doc when I see her next week. That seems to be a deciding factor in if treatment is necessary or not. 

I guess my question is does anyone have the same mutation? It's apparently very common. Did your OB/RE suggest treatment? What treatment plan do you follow? 

I'm almost excited that this may be causing my issues. It just makes sense to me that I'm having egg quality/chromosomal problems when my body can't process folic acid properly.. maybe it's hopeful thinking I've found the problem.

Is there anything I should ask about that you guys can think about so it&#39;s not a pointless appointment?</p>

I had a D&C yesterday for a 9-week pregnancy that went terribly wrong (the pregnancy - so far it looks like the D&C is fine). I started bleeding at 5 weeks, but they found a heartbeat at almost 7 weeks, so I was told to go about my merry way with pelvic rest.

Well, I guess I get the satisfaction of being right. I like knowing things and being right about things. I also like to research, and I thought that because I'd done my research AND because it was my second pregnancy after an unexplained loss (no heartbeat at six weeks... that was back in July), that this one would be fine.

So after two different RE visits saying, ""IVF with PGS is the way to go for you,"" my original RE finally tested my progesterone. 8.3 at 6DPO. She wants 15.

I had been on Prometrium vaginally last cycle and still had a CP anyway. Now I know the controversy is that progesterone might lag if the egg or embryo itself is not going to survive because of chromosomal issues (our karyotypes are both normal) and that the supplements won't do anything, but here are my panicked variables:

I had an 11 day LP after ovulation on CD18/19 for ages. RE wasn't concerned, but my acupuncturist (I know, I know...) felt otherwise. I finally weaned my toddler and took some TCM herbs during a ""month off regrouping"" which included no progesterone supplementation 4dpo and onward -- boom, ovulation 4 days early (temp confirmed). I thought that would have helped any numbers, but that call really surprised me. And was sort of hoping maybe those were the last steps I needed to do to get to a good place.

Now the RE is suggesting a medicated cycle of Femara plus Ovidrel then Prometrium... but if (and by my RE's own words) low progesterone is an effect rather than a cause, is that yet another cycle of heartbreak in my future if I don't just do IVF with PGS?

I found out I was pregnant on August 23rd after our first cycle trying. It felt too good to be true.

There were issues with the pregnancy almost from the get go. I experienced a light bleed at 6 weeks, then a massive bleed with clots at 8 weeks where I was convinced I had lost the pregnancy. Each time I went in for an ultrasound, everything looked great and they couldn't find the cause of the bleeding.

We made it to 12 weeks with no more issues, so we started announcing that we were expecting to our family and friends.

Last Friday as I was walking home from work I felt a warm gush of fluid. When I finally made it home, I could see that the fluid was clear and didn't really have an odor. I tried not to jump to conclusions, but I was convinced that my water had broken. I called the nurse line at my practice and she told me it almost certainly wasn't amniotic fluid because of how early it was in pregnancy (I had just hit 13 weeks that day), and I should only really call back if I start bleeding.

I spotted Saturday, it went away. Then I started spotting again Sunday. I went in to get checked out Monday, and it turns out I was right. My water broke extremely prematurely, and there was virtually no amniotic fluid left. The worst part about it is my baby was still hanging in there with a strong heartbeat.

I had an ultrasound with my regular OB and another the same day with a high-risk OB and both said that this pregnancy was going to end one way or another because the prognosis for babies without any amniotic fluid this early in pregnancy is very bad. They both independently recommended termination to prevent any infection from setting in. 

I had the laminaria inserted yesterday (which hurt like a mother) and had the termination for medical reasons/D&C today at nearly 14 weeks. 

The doctor who performed my D&C said that the heavy bleed that I had experienced at 8 weeks either reflected the cause or was the cause of the premature membrane rupture. He also kept mentioning how extremely unusual it was for something like this to happen so early in pregnancy, and recommended a chromosomal analysis, which we decided to do.

I'm worried there's something wrong with me that caused this to happen, and I don't know that I have the emotional strength to put myself through this again to find out for sure. I'm supposed to wait three months before trying again, which I think I would need to do anyway for the sake of my mental health.

So we just got back from our visit with our RE to go over our test results. My husband's karyotype testing and sperm analysis are completely normal. I have two genetic mutations, PAI 4G/4G and ACE Insertion/Deletion mutation. Simplified by my doctor, the PAI mutation means that I don't break down clots well enough and the ACE I/D mutation means that I make too many clots in the first place. He did say that there wasn't a lot of consensus whether the PAI 4G/4G mutation caused repeat pregnancy loss, but he is very convinced/confident that the two mutations together are causing my issues.

Okay, so what do we do about it? Well he said we have two options. First, the ""Do Nothing"" option, is we try to get pregnant again naturally and then go on baby aspirin and lovenox upon getting a positive HPT. The second option is we do IVF. He says the pros to do IVF is that we can genetically test the embryo before implantation, so we know right away there won't be any genetic issues and we can start the blood thinners 7 days prior to implantation. According to him, the ""Do nothing"" option means we are just playing catch up because we wouldn't start blood thinners until after implantation had already occurred. He also said that with three miscarriages, the likelihood of having another miscarriage on a subsequent pregnancy is in the ball park of 60-70%. IDK where he got those numbers from, but in this book I've read, ""Miscarriage: What Every Woman Needs to Know,"" it says the risk of a subsequent miscarriage after three is approximately 43%. Now this book was published in 1997, so it is probably outdated, but I don't think the risk has gone up that much since that time. Right?

IDK I feel frustrated because I feel like he is trying to push us into IVF with fear tactics. Even calling the first option the ""Do Nothing"" option bothered me because we aren't doing nothing, we are coming up with a treatment plan that includes baby aspirin and lovenox. I have nothing against IVF and it is an option we definitely might chose, but it is very expensive! I have infertility coverage, which I am very grateful for because I know a lot of women don't, but it is still expensive even with the coverage. 

So I am leaning more towards trying again naturally, but maybe take the baby aspirin for my entire cycle and then start the lovenox with a positive HPT. I think my husband is a little more conservative and wants to go to the IVF because he thinks that will guarantee a health baby, since we would know there wouldn't be genetic issues. I had to tell him that nothing guarantees we get to take home a healthy baby.

Sooo what do you guys think? I know ultimately it is up to my husband and I, but we're a little up in the air right now. For anyone on IVF and who is willing to share: Did you pay per cycle/round of IVF or were you able to get multiple rounds of IVF for a payment? How was your experience with it? Is the egg retrieval painful?

Thanks!

Regular warnings - long.

I've been a member of this god awful club for a bit but haven't had the guts to post till today. 

We started trying in April of this year and were pregnant by June. We were terrified and excited all at once. I went from having panic attacks at lunch to looking at nursery ideas that night.

At 7 weeks to the day, right at the end of the month, I lost the pregnancy. I don't have a lot of details on what happened that time, by the time we got the ultrasound at the ER whatever had been was gone and all we were left with was a bill bigger than my deductible and for me to have a bunch of nurses tell me they were sorry and offer me Tylenol. I took the next day off to cry and got pretty plastered over the weekend at a lake house. My HcG was back to 0 by the end of the week. I lurked here a bit that first week, but I was optimistic enough that I didn't lurk beyond that.

In the follow-up to my first loss my OB said to wait until I got my period before trying again, but things did not go to plan. We oopsed our way into pregnancy 2 before my period could return which got me an almost immediate ultrasound. I was so shocked and terrified that the nurse assumed that I didn't want the baby. (She was very wrong.) 

By my best guess, I should have been 6w4d but development showed an empty sac, so I was no more than the end of week 5. The doctor scheduled me for follow-up the next week, assuming the dates were off, I tried to stay optimistic- said more than a few positive affirmations to my reproductive organs- but knew something wasn't right. The next appointment showed no changes. I was measuring exactly the same. I gave it a week to see if things would happen naturally but my uterus refused to believe what was happening and so I ended up opting for a D&C. I surprised the nurses by cracking jokes as I came off anesthesia, because nothing masks the pain so well as self depreciating humor.

Again I was told to wait till my period came back, which - spoilers - we managed to do, but it was a long wait. I was still showing positive on home tests two weeks after the procedure. I told my doctor that I knew it was going to take a while at my two week follow-up which a) he didn't believe (even when I pointed out I have a 35 day cycle normally and the last loss pushed things back already)  and b) caused him to suggest I take progesterone, which I declined because I forgot it can be used to encourage a period. 

I did, however, take him up on a recommendation for a preconception visit with a MFM... which he only did after I mentioned some of my mother's pregnancy horror stories and he remembered that my blood pressure has been nearly ""send her to the ER"" levels every visit. Making that appointment was it's own soap opera as the nurse didn't realize I had miscarried and I gross cried in the reception area after she asked me my due date twice despite having the referral with my diagnosis in hand.

That brings us to now:
My period finally came back, my regular doctor reluctantly put me on BP meds, and according to my tracker my fertile window is just about here. My appointment with the MFM Dr. is next week and hopefully we will get some actual answers because I am sick of people telling me this was just bad luck and I'm sick of people telling me I will ""for sure"" have a baby.

Jan 2017 I found out I was pregnant after having sex once around ovulation. Miscarried late Jan/early Feb at 7w4d. Took a few months off to heal emotionally. Started trying again in July and got instantly pregnant again. No fetal pole/heartbeat at 8 weeks. No fetal pole/heartbeat again at 9 weeks. No fetal pole/heartbeat yet again at 11 weeks so Dr finally called it and gave me Misoprostol to get things going. Took those on Sept 22 and miscarried basically everything within 4-5 hours. Last week I had laparoscopic surgery to remove the very large cyst on my left ovary that had been caught on my first ultrasound back in Jan. Unfortunately, I ended up losing that ovary and my left tube. That brings us to now.

At my 11 week ultrasound to triple confirm that I did not have a viable pregnancy, I asked my OB about fertility testing because I am quite honestly a fucking mess after 2 miscarriages, that I can't stand the thought of doing this a third time. I'm desperate for answers as to why this has happened to me twice now. My OB's nurse just called me a bit ago to give me 2 fertility clinics to look into, so I can discuss the next steps at my post-op follow up next week. As we were talking, my first post-miscarriage period showed up.

I'm stuck. Do we start trying since it's CD1 for me and I'll be cleared for sex right in time for my potential fertile window? Or do we wait and go the fertility clinic route?

I told my husband that I want to discuss this and that I want honest feedback and opinions from him, but I already know he will tell me that he wants to do whatever I want to do. He's supportive almost to a fault sometimes because he just wants me to be happy and to do whatever I am comfortable with. Basically, he is zero help.

My real questions to all of you out there: if you have a history of recurrent miscarriages, did you go to a fertility clinic? What was the process like for you? What made you decide to go to a fertility clinic? Did it help diagnose what was causing the miscarriages? Were you able to go on to have a successful pregnancy?

Multiple rounds of misoprostol and miscarried with lots of bleeding Saturday, Oct 14. Things seemed to progress normally so I waited until Monday morning to call Drs office. They said everything sounded fine but they would check with Dr. to see if I needed to come in. Had me come in for US to see if I passed everything (48 hrs after MC). US tech showed results to Dr while I waited (still some thick lining, potential tissue remaining) and then sent me home with birth control and instructions to come back in two weeks for an hcg beta to see if my levels where back to 0.

They were told that I am A- and that the father is O+ and confirmed this before my MC. This was my first pregnancy and I trusted them to take proper precautions. A couple days ago, I realized that they did not give me Rhogam within 72 hours of my MC and called the office. The front desk woman did not sound like she even understood what I was talking about and at first told me I was 'just A', not A-. Then the nurse called me back and told me that they only give it to pregnant women and there is no risk of sensitization from MC, which I know is not true. 

I called my Drs cell directly yesterday and she said that I should have gone to the hospital after my MC (which they never told me to do) and they would have given me the shot there but I can get it on Monday. I expressed concern that we are not even close to the required 72 hr window and asked for a sensitization test and she said that she was told it was a 32 day window and they wouldn't give me a test until months after my Rhogam shot on Monday.

I am so angry and frustrated. Everything I read from trusted sources indicates that the '32 day window' is not a thing and that I can't change it if I am sensitized now. If I am, then my future pregnancies will be high-risk because of an entirely preventable immune response if they had given me Rhogam when they saw me for the US. I don't believe that the office, nurse, or doctor know what they are talking about at this point. If I get the shot on Monday (which is likely to do nothing this long after potential exposure), then I won't be able to get an accurate sensitization test before we planned on started ttc again. 

Sorry for the extended explanation! Any thoughts on whether or not I should get the shot on Monday? Should I refuse and get the sensitization test elsewhere?

I had a CP/ early loss at the end of last month, with a BFP on Sept 25th, a week of bleeding and fading lines and then a BFN (blood) on October 2nd.  I haven‚Äôt told anyone (apart from DH, obviously) not because I am afraid of stigma, but because I don‚Äôt want anyone knowing we are TTC again - I am yet to start back at work after having my first child 18 months ago, and I work in a birthing hospital where it would be all people could talk about.  Having that external pressure of getting pregnant because other people are expecting it would be really stressful.  And, I don‚Äôt want to risk my job if for some reason my boss heard about my plans (not actually that unlikely in my line of work!)

Hoped so badly that we would be able to conceive this cycle, and BD every other day from the day after the bleeding stopped for a good couple of weeks, and sporadically thereafter.   I thought that would be enough. 

Then, my grandad died a week ago.  That hit me hard. 

I took test after test from what I thought was 10-11DPO, all negatives, all heartbreaking.  
I got my period two days ago, and it is crampy and sore and awful. 

A friend sent me a photo of a very obviously positive FRER on the same day my period arrived, saying ‚Äúomg I‚Äôm not going crazy right?! We weren‚Äôt really trying! I guess someone had to be the first in our group to get pregnant again!!!‚Äù and I wanted to cry, congratulate her, tell her about my loss and take away her victory, and punch her all at once.  I settled for the first two. 

Grandad‚Äôs funeral was yesterday, and it was lovely, but I‚Äôm just in a very sad place at the moment.  But, at least I can have a wine or two with my family to toast Grandad (myself and my son are staying with my dad in a different city from home, while DH works). 

I think I might try temping this cycle (haven‚Äôt done it before) just to try to feel like I have some kind of control over something.  Is this a totally silly idea?

Since we first started TTC, I've had off and on spotting before my period, usually lasting about 3-4 days, but sometimes up to 7 or 8 days. I brought this up with my OB and she wasn't concerned - just told me to count CD1 as the first day of red.

We lost our first in June. My body stopped responding to my oral progesterone two months ago, and I am now on hCG injections to extend the length of my cycle. We did one month without TTC to see how I would react. Everything went as expected, so now this month we are TTC with the shots.

That's the thing, though. No one deserves this. I don't take comfort in knowing other women know how this feels because it's shit. No one should ever know this feeling. But here we are.

I was six weeks and 3 days pregnant. Everything was fine and dandy. I was starting to get all the signs. Until last night when I started bleeding. Just spots. So, I thought. Fine, no biggie. Must be just some spotting. I also couldn't make up my mind if the cramps I felt were dull aches or aches, so I just thought it was normal.

This morning, I woke up and there was so much blood. Husband and I went to the hospital. We went to the OB, she recommended an ultrasound, which I did. When I came back to her, she said it.

""There's no more baby. You had a miscarriage,"" she said other things, but this is all I heard before I burst into tears. I was crying for a good five minutes. And she just let me.

She'd explained lots of things to my husband and I. But I'm not sure I was hearing it. I was and I wasn't. I started crying in between her telling us details. She would ask me if she shouldn't go on, but I said, she should. I wanted to know why. 

I'm going back there in a week for tests. I still have all the signs. My boobs still hurt like hell, even as much as a brush against something makes them sore. I've been dead tired the whole day. But there's no more baby. I'm experiencing all this shit for absolutely nothing. 

I'm sitting here. It's past midnight where I'm from. I'm trying to work on my backlog (I work from home). My boss said for me to take the week off, but I can't just sit and do nothing. I'll end up crying every time. But maybe I should take her offer anyway because it doesn't matter. No matter what I'm doing, I end up crying out of nowhere.

My inlaws and parents are trying to make me feel better by saying I shouldn't worry. I'm still young, there will be more chances, it wasn't even fully a baby yet. They're not fucking helping. I just want them to leave me alone. I don't want them to make me feel better. I don't feel better. I feel like I will never be better.

It came out of nowhere, with no signs that anything had gone wrong. I sat down to give a urine sample in the ER and felt big pieces of tissue fall out of me. Without even thinking, I caught what I could in the cup and gave it to the nurse in case they could analyze it. With my baby literally falling out of me, I have no idea how I had the sense to save it. I couldn't look but also couldn't look away. All I saw were big lumps of red tissue. 

I left the hospital bleeding, distraught at how literally empty my uterus felt. It acquainted me with a sense of loss like I had never experienced.

My water had broken and we were on our way to have our baby girl. So full of anticipation and excitement, with no clue about how significantly our lives were about to change. Just three years ago, we walked into the hospital with a broken amniotic sac; this time, we left the hospital with broken hearts. 

The coming weeks brought a few answers. The ""products of conception"" (ugh) were tested and revealed no genetic abnormalities. That knowledge brought fresh tears. My perfect little baby. My son.

It's day 3 and the physical pain is so bad at some points. Contractions that feel never ending and then suddenly I'll feel physically fine for hours at a time and I hope it's over but then I get hit again with the pain and blood and sadness. 

Day 1 I was spotting and flying home from Phoenix to Canada and was going to go to the hospital at my first layover because I was concerned for the baby. 3 hour flight. Throughout the flight I'd clench my stomach in pain every few minutes. I shifted in my seat and felt a gush. I quickly got up and walked to the bathroom feeling it running down my leg wishing it was pee. It wasn't. The stewardess got my husband for me as I panicked on the toilet. One of the stewardesses came into the bathroom and comforted me, she had a miscarriage once on a plane also at 11 weeks. 

They call the paramedics for when we land and I took the ambulance to the hospital. After an ultrasound and unstoppable bleeding it was confirmed. The ER doctor suspected the baby had stopped growing a few weeks earlier and my HCG levels had finally dropped low enough to miscarry at terrible timing. Constant labour pains in my uterus and back. They monitored me for 6 hours and did a physical exam to get rid of a lot of the clots and then I was released told I would bleed for up to 3 weeks and could try again after my next cycle. 

The airline was amazing and got us a hotel room and changed our flights to the next day, 

Day 2 we told our families. I was feeling okay throughout the day physically maybe every 10 minutes would cramp a little. We get home around 5pm my sister brings us supper and as the night goes on the pain becomes excruciating. First it was every 5 minutes then it was every minute knives digging into my uterus and twisting and more blood clots. My sister gave me some stronger pain meds she had and it didn't do much but finally after 3 hours of pain it started to come less frequently until I could finally sleep. 

And now it's day 3 and I'm so sad and it still hurts. 

Day 4 tomorrow is another ultrasound and a doctors appointment. 

I'm still here. I wish I wasn't in this situation. My first baby and my first loss. My husband has been amazing. Thanks for welcoming me in this community. 

Edit: Thank you everyone for your kind words. Its almost been a week now and I am becoming more at peace with what happened. <3

It started yesterday when I had something like a vision (I‚Äôm hesitant to call it that because it sounds stupid and unrealistic but it‚Äôs the only thing I can think to call it) that when I wiped there was blood and I miscarried. 

It happened as I sat to have a morning pee yesterday before work. I wiped and it was brown spotting like it would be right when my period would start. By this time I was 5 weeks and had gotten several positive tests so I know it wasn‚Äôt just my period. I ended up bleeding heavily and passing clots. I never saw any tissue being passed. I went to my doctor and turned in my very bloody urine sample. My doctor came in saying ‚ÄúCongratulations, foreverambrea!‚Äù. The nurse didn‚Äôt even brief him on the fact that I was about to possibly loose my baby. Fuck. 

So I finish up with my Dr and he tells me he just wants to get labs to test the HCG in my blood to see where the numbers are going. So he leaves to write up my labs and he comes back a couple mins later and tells me the urine sample I provided came back negative. Cool. So he said it isn‚Äôt even worth doing labs and to go home and be comfortable as possible while I pass the rest of my baby. 

My breasts aren‚Äôt sore anymore. I don‚Äôt have any more symptoms. I feel empty. 

Is there ANY chance that there COULD still be a baby in there? Has anyone had these things happen and there still be a baby?

I had my first miscarriage at 9 weeks in Nov 2016 after 1.5 yrs of trying. Got pregnant first month trying after that, but miscarried at 8 weeks in April. I decided to take a break for a while because I was heartbroken and didn‚Äôt think I could handle it if the worst happened again.  I did the testing my OB recommended, which all came back normal. I also wanted to make sure my husband was taking supplements, etc. before starting again.

Anyway, here we are. I think I ovulated a couple days ago, but the OPKs were unclear so I can‚Äôt be sure. We tried to follow the sperm meets egg plan, but with illness and an unclear ovulation date it didn‚Äôt go quite according to plan. We did ok, but Im a little disappointed we didn‚Äôt do everything we could. Maybe it‚Äôs for the best... I tend to get a little obsessive (more than a little), but if I don‚Äôt know the exact ov date it might force me to embrace the unknown a little more.

While we were waiting to try, I was really focused on healing and got to a much better place. I told myself I would keep up my hobbies and stay busy to avoid obsessing about TTC. About a week before we started I was beating myself up a little for not having done enough (we never saw a fertility specialist - only our OB), but felt pretty good and relaxed about everything overall. Then after we started trying, one of my closest friends announced she was pregnant. I am very happy for her and she‚Äôs coming off a miscarriage of her own, so she gets it, but I feel like it‚Äôs put some additional pressure on me to get pregnant soon. The longer I go without getting pregnant, the harder it will be to see her growing belly. I don‚Äôt want to have to put space between us. Hearing her news took some wind out of my sails that‚Äôs been hard to get back.

Most of the time I‚Äôm either sad, angry, or worried. And the worst part is I know that getting pregnant is only step one of the long battle ahead.

I left this subreddit in May when DH deployed because I was expecting to be out for the rest of the year. However, due to a major death in the family, he‚Äôs home and I‚Äôm back in the game. I‚Äôm not sure if anyone here remembers me but here is some BG info-

Been TTC since May 2016. Came off the pill in that same month. Got pregnant in January of this year but MC‚Äôd around Valentine‚Äôs Day @6wks. I started tracking at that time but did not get pregnant again before DH left. 

I‚Äôm coming to an end of a cycle and I wanted to ask you ladies a question. I‚Äôm starting to suspect I have low progesterone levels due to the following: trouble conceiving, staying pregnant, spotting during my LP, short LP (12 Days give or take) among other random symptoms I‚Äôve seen with it. 

Here‚Äôs the Q- could low progesterone affect my pre-pregnancy HCG level and how fast it rises if I conceive? 

I‚Äôm asking this because in January I took an FRER and got a BFN a day before I expected AF to come. I wasn‚Äôt tracking so I could have been off but there was a window of time we were BDing and a long gap where we didn‚Äôt so I had to have O‚Äôd sometime around that BD period. I didn‚Äôt get my BFP until the day after I expected AF (expected was CD27, BFP was CD28). It was super faint. I almost didn‚Äôt call it a BFP. 

So now I‚Äôm at the end of my cycle. I read LP shouldn‚Äôt change much. Mine from my tracked cycles is 11-12 days. I‚Äôm on 13/14. No BFP. That‚Äôs why I‚Äôm asking about the progesterone effect on HCG. It is possible I O‚Äôd later since I was really sick during my fertile window but there‚Äôs no way I could have gotten accurate temps (if I had been temping) at the time to confirm if O happened and I wasn‚Äôt going to continue to pee on OPKs.

110,2048,confidence,<praw.reddit.Reddit object at 0x7f12a630cd90>,,ttcafterloss,"[Intro] Hello everyone. I'm sad to have to be here but also glad I don't have to suffer in silence. 

Back in 2009 I was 19 and had a surprise pregnancy. This pregnancy turned out to be a blighted ovum. I had a D&C and was heartbroken. My boyfriend and I at the time decided to actually try and got pregnant again right away the next cycle. That pregnancy seemed absolutely normal until my gender scan at 19 weeks. It was to be the happiest day and made an ugly turn for the worst. The ultrasound tech wasn't saying anything and had to get up to go get the doctor. They explained that the baby was measuring only 16 weeks and seemed to have quite a few abnormalities. I was sent to a women's hospital for an amniocentesis which confirmed that my baby girl had Triploidy. A rare, random chromosomal defect which is incompatible with life. I had to make the decision to carry on and wait for my baby to die and deliver her, risking health complications for myself or to be induced and deliver her. I made the difficult decision to deliver her then. 

My doctor and the specialists assured me that the blighted ovum and baby with triploidy were not related at all. They assured me these are completely random and unavoidable. They are not signs of a chromosomal or genetic defect in myself and there is no reason I could not go on to have a healthy baby. I simply was having bad luck. I was young and with the stress of losing our baby, my boyfriend and I at the time split not long after her death. 

Fast forward 8 years later and here I am again. I'm now 26 and in a very loving relationship with a great man. We decided I would go off birth control in September. I again got pregnant right away. I had 8 positive pregnancy tests between last Monday-Wednesday. We were both ecstatic and I was so sure of this pregnancy. 

Friday evening I started to have some cramping and light spotting. By the time I woke up on Saturday I was full on bleeding. I called my OB on call staff and they told me to go to the ER. I was evaluated, had blood work and an ultrasound. My hcg was only 16 and there was nothing to be found in my uterus. The ER doctor said he couldn't even tell me if I was pregnant for sure or not and blamed faulty, too-sensitive pregnancy tests for giving me false positives. I know he was just trying to make me feel better, but I know how unlikely that is. 8 false positive tests with varying brands of tests with my period over a week late? Not likely. I knew from doing research I was having a chemical pregnancy. I'm supposed to follow up today with more blood work to rule out an ectopic pregnancy. 

So, here I am. Young and healthy with 3 losses under my belt. I'm frustrated because I keep hearing it's just ""bad luck"". That there's no reason I can't go on to have a healthy baby and pregnancy. All 3 of my losses can possibly be from chromosomal abnormalities. I'm starting to think I have poor quality eggs..

I don&#39;t want to ask inappropriate questions because I don&#39;t feel it&#39;s my place to prod into such a bad time in his life, especially since I know therapy worked wonders for him. 
Has anyone here experienced loss with a different partner than you&#39;re currently with? What would you want to hear from your current partner? I guess my concern is I don&#39;t want to become pregnant and he experience major anxiety throughout my entire pregnancy because of his past experience. How can I help be supportive of him without dredging up old crappy memories? </p>

A few weeks ago a few of you had suggested that I may benefit from therapy.  I agreed that it could be helpful.  I wasn't really sure what to look for in a therapist or what I'm hoping to get out from therapy, so I figured I'd just find some potential therapists while I figure out what I wanted.  Popped my location, insurance company, and some other preferences into some sort of therapist/psychologist database and got back a handful of names in my area.  I was feeling mostly OK at the time so I left it at that and put the therapist search on a back-burner.

Since then a bunch of small things came up, and it triggered an avalanche of resentment, anger, hurt, and sadness that I've clearly been in denial about.  To keep it short, I'll put it in bullet points with things listed mostly in reverse chronological order.  I also apologize for how long, rambly, and ranty this all is :(...

* A week ago SisterA sent me pictures of SisterB trying on bridesmaid dresses for SisterA's wedding in the early spring.  Mom and SisterB liked one of the dresses, I replied back that I agree that looked the best.
* This prompted me to recall that a few weeks earlier while looking at wedding dresses with SisterA, she told me that she was thinking of having me handle seating instead of being a bridesmaids because I'm super organized and would be ""more useful behind the scenes.""  She would instead ask a friend to be her second bridesmaid.  Her wedding, her call, so I said, ""OK no problem.""
* This subsequently reminded me that a few weeks further back while I was 6 weeks pregnant, I found out that she was considering a date within 2 days of my EDD for her wedding.  After some consideration, I decided to go ahead and give SisterA a head's up.  During this conversation she mentioned she was going to ask me to be a bridesmaid but given the timing, it probably would be difficult for me.  I agreed with her assessment.  A week later I found out I was going to lose the pregnancy.  Since timing was no longer a problem, we had several conversations indicating that I would be a bridesmaid as planned.
* I remembered that SisterA had previously insinuated that she and her husband-to-be planned to start trying for kids ASAP, and it got me thinking that she'll probably beat me to kids, *even though I know it is NOT a competition*.
* Mom was with us while looking at wedding dresses for SisterA, she had made some really rude comments about SisterA's weight and short stature, comparing her to the tall slender woman next to us who was also trying on dresses and looked amazing in everything.  This reminded me of all the shitty things my parents said to me over the course of 3 years when I was dating, engaged, and planning a wedding.  How they tried to convince me to break up with my husband because of his race and lack of religious beliefs (I'm atheist, too), then called me a slut because I had gone on a trip with him after we were engaged.  My sisters jumped on the slut-shaming bandwagon, too.  Shockingly(/s), I only minimally involved my family in my wedding--they were really more like guests who happened to be family of the bride--and dad told SisterA how unhappy he was that I didn't have him give me away, or include a father-daughter dance.
* I was already feeling kinda down with SisterA sending me pics of SisterB in bridesmaid dresses, but what really sent me over the edge was yesterday when my childhood best friend posted an album with family photos of her parents, brother, husband, and MIL with their two kids, celebrating her youngest's first month.

I'm sure her family has had disagreements and fights too, and I'm fully aware that FB walls are typically curated to present the best moments... but damn did that album make me feel like utter shit.

To be clear: I am truly happy for my friend, and for all I know she could have had her own struggles with infertility and simply never advertised it.  But her FB wall is filled with photos of all her kids' milestones, personalized hashtags for each of them, and lots of candid photos of them doing cute, silly kid things.  I'm considering whether to simply stop following her (while still being friends), but other friends' posts of their kids don't bother me.

Anyway, I thought I was being pretty good about hiding my feelings while I processed them, but my husband knew something was up and asked me about it.  I had planned to talk to him once I figured out what I wanted to say, but since he asked I gave him a brief overview of what's been bothering me, he gave me hugs and kisses, and I've come to the realization that I really need to talk to a professional about all these issues.  But now, I'm not even sure what sort of specialties I should be looking for since it seems like I could fall into a lot of categories ranging from miscarriage/infertility to feelings of inadequacy to ... I don't know, maybe general depression??  I've also been drinking a lot more recently, and it takes a bit of a conscious reminder to myself to NOT pour myself a drink every night, so I suppose you can add at-risk-alcoholic to that list.  Should I find one therapist with experience in all these areas, or see more than one simultaneously (which seems overkill to me)?

I know I would like to avoid taking any sort of medication, and I also know I don't want to really address any of these issues with my parents because it is simply not going to go anywhere.  Their words and actions are very Asian Parent Style Tough Love.  As an example, when SisterA rolled her eyes at mom's comment about her begin fat, mom said, ""You just don't like hearing that because you know I'm speaking the truth.  I'm telling you the truth for your own good.""  Also, since getting married they've mellowed out and our relationship is much better... though I think it's mostly because they now consider me my husband's responsibility and I because see them only once a month despite living in the same city.

My first instinct is to start planning when we can try again. Our doctor told us we must wait two cycles--the first will be in 4-6 weeks, and I'm like a Swiss clock so then another 4 weeks after that. Then we're in mid/late December for our first attempt.

So much of who I'd planned to be over the next 5 months was wrapped up in this pregnancy, and now I realize that wasn't ideal. I lost a lot of myself, and disconnected from my lovely husband in many ways, too. Yet I really, really just want to get back on this train, even with all the heartache we've experienced. Our specific circumstances aren't indicative of any fertility problems, and the chances of having conjoined twins again are almost impossible.

Aside from grieving, which seems an unpredictable element, I don't see a reason to wait. Am I missing something? I'm not thrilled by the prospect of being super pregnant in summer, as I would be if we got lucky our first time trying again and things went better than they did this time, but aside from that I don't see an issue.

Those who consciously decided to wait to try longer than the minimum advised by your doctors, what made you want to wait? Did anyone have a disconnect with your partner about when to try again, and if so, how did you resolve the disconnect?

For context, my husband and I have been married almost a year, known each other for two, and this was our first pregnancy. We have no other children, and both desperately want to start a family. We are very solid in our marriage, have a lot of family support, and are generally well put together people.",t2_6w9mx,False,,0,False,How do you know when it's time to try?,[],r/ttcafterloss,False,0,,0,,,False,t3_77bpt0,False,dark,1.0,,public,6,0,{},,,False,[],,False,False,,{},,False,6,,False,self,False,,[],{},,True,,1508410094.0,text,0,,,text,self.ttcafterloss,False,"<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=""md""><p>Our twins were removed from my body yesterday afternoon.
