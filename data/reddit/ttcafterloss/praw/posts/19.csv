I got a faint positive on DPO 13, but on the following day the tests were even fainter, then I got a heavy period, which was right on schedule. This was such a textbook CP that I never even called my doctor. It CRUSHED me. I've not been the same since. &nbsp;

Well, that was all about 11 days ago. We're getting back on the TTC horse. As of yesterday I'm monitoring LH again, and it seems like I'm about to surge tmw. Out of curiosity, I took a couple pregnancy tests along with my LH. Well, the pregnancy tests are *positive*. Clearly positive. I don't get it. My LH seems to be increasing, which shouldn't happen during pregnancy, but likewise the pregnancy tests are still positive, and actually they are darker than they were when I got my original (or so I thought) BFP. Yet, they're not as dark as you'd think if I was pregnant, I'd be about 6 weeks by now. 
&nbsp;

My temp also is more similar to what it had been post ovulation, and never went down during AF. But this was a HEAVY period I had. One day I had some serious clots, more clotty than I usually see. It also dragged on a couple days longer; 7 instead of my usual 3 or 4, which brown spots at the ending. The emotional pain was too great after the CP for me to get my hopes up again, so I want to hear if anyone else has experienced this. Have you had pregnancy tests remain positive after miscarriages or CP? For how long? Did they ever get stronger? What the heck does all this mean?!

Also, if I am pregnant, FUCK, my husband and I drank like a bottle of wine for two days straight when I thought I'd lost the baby, we were so filled with grief and sadness. If I never lost it... what have I done now??

I've just arrived home to an empty house (my husband is out with friends) after my 9th day working in a row and I am feeling a bit emotional. And wanted to chat to someone, anyone! 
Just a bit about me: I live in Melbourne Australia, I am 25 and my husband is 30. We have been married for 3 years and are looking at buying our first house in a few months time! 
We lost our first baby on November 17th 2015 but were trying for 13 months before we conceived.
I lost our baby at 7 weeks and 2 days, but I didn't know until I thought I was 9 weeks! I had a complete miscarriage naturally and I was very lucky to not need a d&c.
I have had 3 cycles since the pregnancy and haven't been successful yet, my period arrived yesterday and I am feeling so empty and so devastated that I am considering calling in sick tomorrow! I feel as though I lost our beautiful baby because I work too hard (I am a chef at a big hotel in the city and work upwards of 60 hours in a week!) 
I have been crying every night on the way home from work because I have 2 colleagues and 3 friends who are having babies and it makes me want to have my baby back, and be able to feel him or her in my belly! 
My husband keeps saying that we can try again next month but I find it so devastating to have to wait so long (32 days) only to see a negative test.
I am terrified it will take another year for us to have another baby. 
I know we are young and have a lot of time but I feel as though I will never truly heal until I have another baby with me!

I was really curious to see how my body would respond to the loss and how quickly it would bounce back. I got my usual strong 2 day LH surge right on time. But we were SUPER stressed.... one of my husbands employees (direct report) passed away the first day of the surge. Usually my temp spikes the day after the surge, but this time it was FIVE DAYS after the surge!! I never believed stress could have that much of an impact on ovulation. I was convinced it was going to be anovulatory, but there was a clear temp shift!

[The chart](http://www.fertilityfriend.com/home/believer/)

Pre-CP I had a clockwork-like 26 day cycle. I was really curious to see how my body would respond to the loss and how quickly it would bounce back. I got my usual strong 2 day LH surge right on time. But we were SUPER stressed.... one of my husbands employees (direct report) passed away the first day of the surge. Usually my temp spikes the day after the surge, but this time it was FIVE DAYS after the surge!! I never believed stress could have that much of an impact on ovulation. I was convinced it was going to be anovulatory, but there was a clear temp shift!</p>

She talks about how our society says you can't have grief and joy at the same time, and that the only way you can find joy again is to pack away the grief and find ""closure""....but that's not how this works....its been over a decade since I lost a high school friend and I still think of her often (I thought of her just yesterday when I heard time after time in the restaurant I was at with my husband) this doesn't mean I haven't found closure or that there is something wrong, it means she was important to me and I shared a lot of joy with her and I honor that every time I think of her or smile when a memory pops back into my head...

It's been 128 days since my first miscarriage and 13 days since my second. There's nothing wrong with the fact that I still want to talk about it and deal with it. It's been 17 years since my friends stillborn and almost 3 years since my best friends miscarriage...all three of us find comfort in talking to each other and talking about our expiriences and there's nothing wrong with that whether it's been 2 weeks or 17 years....but society and other people make you feel that way because it makes them uncomfortable.

 one thing I reflected on too when listening to this talk, was that I see this flaw in our society's view of grief work the other way around too...that you can't be happy when your grieving... someone can still smile and joke with the ones they love and be productive at work but still be struggling with grief, and just because someone may have started to pick up and smile and not cry all the time doesn't mean it doesn't still hurt...I went right back to working and smilling and living my life because although I am sad for the loss of two children I never got to hold, I'm still alive and I want to enjoy that....my mother and Nana mean well, but because I'm not hysterical about it they feel it can be part of casual conversation and that hurts and they're suprised when I cry because I'm not outwardly grieving in a way that makes them think they need to be sensitive.

This also doesn't mean I need anyone to remind me I should be sad, trust me, i know how sad it is....grief is a process that everyone handles differently, and each loss is different....When someone is ready to talk about their grief they will, just be open to hear it and meet them where they are, don't try to force it out to ""help them heal"" in your way, let them heal in their way because it's their loss not yours.",t2_8ahjb,False,,0,False,Could be a trigger...reflection on a talk about grief,[],r/ttcafterloss,False,0,trigger,0,,,False,t3_45ynaf,False,dark,0.94,,public,12,0,{},,,False,[],,False,False,,{},Trigger,False,12,,True,self,False,,[],{},,True,,1455598177.0,text,0,,,text,self.ttcafterloss,False,"<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=""md""><p>I just watched <a href=""http://esme.com/resources/content/bereavement-grief/writing-ted-talk-help-for-single-moms-grieving-the-loss-of-a-child"">this</a> ted talk about why mother&#39;s should talk about the loss of children...but it isn&#39;t just grieving mother&#39;s...it&#39;s about grief and loss in general. </p>

<p>She talks about how our society says you can&#39;t have grief and joy at the same time, and that the only way you can find joy again is to pack away the grief and find &quot;closure&quot;....but that&#39;s not how this works....its been over a decade since I lost a high school friend and I still think of her often (I thought of her just yesterday when I heard time after time in the restaurant I was at with my husband) this doesn&#39;t mean I haven&#39;t found closure or that there is something wrong, it means she was important to me and I shared a lot of joy with her and I honor that every time I think of her or smile when a memory pops back into my head...</p>

So looking at the low betas and the tenderness on left side, he is ruling this as suspected ectopic. I am supposed to get the MTX shot tomorrow, really hoping that resolves this mess.

My first pregnancy came from us not actively preventing. I wasn't 100% sure I wanted kids quite then as we had just gotten married and were still adjusting to our new city. However, when I found out I was pregnant last Father's day, I realized I was ready. My doctor was never able to firmly tell me how far along I was; development appeared to have stopped around the 6 week mark or so but it had been roughly 10 weeks since I had gotten my positive test when I started miscarrying. At first, I was sad but not entirely surprised - I had had a D&C and leep procedure the year before for some abnormal cells and my mother had taken 10 years to conceive me after her first miscarriage. ""This is not abnormal"" I said, ""I can enjoy drinking at Oktoberfest and football now"", I said. Most days, that was fine, but others not so much. My EDD would have been this week and trying not to focus on it too much, especially after losing it when I messed up the cake I was baking for a coworkers shower last week.

We agreed to not try again though until our house sold and we got through the second round of layoffs. (My husband and I both do IT work for an oil and gas company) The stress of it all we figured would just make things worse. So here we are, oil is still crap but we're looking at moving to a new city and our house has sold. So we are trying again, yay!

My cycles were SUPER off prior to my first pregnancy - 50+ days long. I had had blood work done and was taking a couple of different hormone pills, one of which increases fertility. Since my MC, my first few cycles were right at 31-33 days til this last one (39 days), so I figured things were fine. I've started temping this week and watching my MC. Should I go ahead and still have a visit with my NP to recheck hormone levels and see if I should be back on the pills I was taking?

So I had my first miscarriage 120 days ago today...I took that one really hard because I was trying to MAKE myself okay, and I wasn't...I wasn't  letting myself be sad or talk about it...I eventually opened up and cried it out and started moving on in a more healthy mannor...however (and this could be upsetting to some given the audience here so please stop if you're still sensitive)

Last week in our 6th cycle of actively trying (over a year since we ""stopped preventing"") and 3rd cycle from my first miscarriage...I did get a faintly positive test, and then promptly started bleeding the next day. This continued into the night where it became so heavy I can only describe it as ""gushing"" and I not only bled out of a pad but also down both my legs and passed about 4 clots the size of my palm (is my uterus even that big?)....this was very nerve rattling so I called the doctor and went in the next day...

The doctor explained early loss to me and what it can mean and what it can look like, and symptoms to watch out for and sent me for blood work to confirm that the hcg was out of my system and the pregnancy was complete. 

But it wasn't, my hcg came back inconclusive and they explained that I still had hcg present but not enough to be considered pregnant, but also not little enough to be considered not pregnant. So I have to go back in Monday to be tested again.

Then the bleeding abruptly stopped...is assumed that meant the miscarriage was over and I made the stupid mistake of taking a pregnancy test again at home to confirm this...I was hoping to see a stark white test...I just wanted this to be over and done so i can move on...but it wasn't stark white...I still have a faint line, and it might even be darker but I'm not sure and now I'm so mad at myself that I even took a test.

I'm so confused now and I don't know what to think....am I still pregnant? Could this be viable? Or does this mean I need medical intervention to complete the miscarriage? Can a pregnancy survive bleeding like that? Could it be ectopic even if I don't have pain?

We waited 5 months to try again (on purpose) and got pregnant on our 3rd cycle. We were so excited and felt blessed...but I was obviously nervous.

I purposely made myself be excited and buy things/tell people/talk about it. I didn't want to feel disconnected or keep myself from being excited due to our previous loss. I thought it was only fair to that baby to give it my all. And I did a decent job of that, while still being nervous.

I went through hell during my 1st trimester, again. Sick, sick, sick. Every single symptom you can think of, I had it. People kept telling me that's a good sign and I was annoyed by those comments. Because I had all that crap during my 1st pregnancy and loss, too. But I tried to remember they were trying to help/be nice. 

I was incredibly open about our 1st loss. That helped me, but later it helped others, which I was happy about. If I had to go through it, the least I could do is help others. So everyone who learned about my 2nd pregnancy was overjoyed for us, more so than they might have been if they didn't know about our 1st loss. I was able to talk about it a lot and had many prayer warriors and people thinking of us. Everyone knew how nervous I was, of course.

In the last 1.5 weeks, two of my closest friends told me that THEY are pregnant. They are due in September, and I thought I was either late August or early September. HOW EXCITING, right?!  I was pumped to get to be pregnant at the same time as them and we chatted about it daily.

I went to my first appointment on Wednesday 2/3...I wasn't POSITIVE how far along I was, due to some weird periods after my previous D&C, but I was thinking either 8+6 or 10+6....leaning towards further along.

Well, obviously that appointment didn't go well. I knew it IMMEDIATELY when the ultrasound started...my husband didn't...I looked over at him and saw he was looking at the screen and trying to see what was going on. He glanced at me, I was staring at him, and he gave me a questioning look. So I whispered ""It's not good. Its not good at all...""

The tech let us know that the baby was only measuring 7+3....and had no heartbeat. But my uterus was measuring 10+5. So, I would have been due in late August. I'd have had a baby this summer. And now...no. Just no. I likely won't even have one in 2016 now.

From there it was a bit of a blur. My husband held me and we cried. Then we saw the doctor. I was given all the options, again, and chose a D&C.  It felt like deja vu. Same office, same tech. UGH. I chose the D&C for many reasons, but a big plus is that they offered to test the baby. I was worried they wouldn't until I maybe had a 3rd loss, but I was going to ask. I didn't have to, they immediately offered. And to test us, too.  

I had my D&C yesterday...<24 hours after hearing/seeing the bad news. It's so surreal that 2 days ago I was going in to the doctor hoping to hear a heartbeat for the first time ever and find out my due date and get extra excited. Then BAM. No heartbeat, have surgery, no more baby. What is going on?! :(

I'm in some pain from the D&C, but its manageable. But emotionally I'm...feeling numb, I guess. I am sad sometimes, pissed off other times, but mainly I feel like I just can't process it. Is that normal?

I'm already worried about my ability to be a good friend to my two pregnant friends. I know they'll both be sensitive of this and try not to talk to me too much about their pregnancies, but then I already feel bad about that. I am overjoyed for them (when I'm not numb), but just don't know how much I can handle. 

People keep telling me their stories of people they know who have had 2-5 miscarriages and now have healthy babies. Well that's great for them. It really is. And yes its LIKLEY that I could have healthy children in the future. But right now I wanted THAT one and I won't ever get to have that one. And yes, I'm worried there may be something wrong that means my husband and I can't make a living baby. Of course I'm worried about that. ARGH.

We would be amazing parents. We WANT to be parents. WHAT THE HELL?!

I figured I'd make a separate post about the hubby's follow up results because I know a lot of you have been with me on this journey over the past few months and have requested to be kept up to date. For those of you that don't know, my husband was diagnosed with testicular cancer in October. He actually had the appointment that discovered it on our EDD, but got the news the next day. What a way to make that day even worse, right? He had to have his right testicle removed. His semen analysis at that point was not very good. Basically, the cancer was most likely the reason we haven't been able to get pregnant since our loss last March.

It's been over three months since his surgery and we just did his follow up SA this week. His results are AMAZING!!!!! Back to normal!!!!! I am so relieved and feel like there's finally hope again.

Here's the October results with the cancer:
Count: 64 million/ml (surprisingly not terrible, but not great)
Motility: 28% (I think. I don't have that report on me at the moment) only about 21% was progressive
Morphology: 1%
Many of the other factors, like viscosity, were ""abnormal""

January's results:
Count: 241 million/ml (wow! That's a lot of sperm)
Motility: 85% with 80% progressive
Morphology: 5%
All the other factors were back to ""normal""

Thank you all for your support over the last 10 months since our loss and a special thank you for being there for me during the cancer diagnosis. Last year was the absolute worst year of our lives. I don't know how I would have managed without this sub.

P.s. When I asked the Mr. to screen shot and send me his new results, he gave me the strangest look and asked why I needed them. I told him, ""I have to update Reddit!

I'm getting my progesterone levels tested next month. Very happy about that. Interestingly, she said that having bad cramps during your period is actually a good sign of having sufficient progesterone.

I feel like this is just the beginning of a long, long journey to get pregnant. Meanwhile, so many people around me are pregnant or have kids.

89,2048,confidence,<praw.reddit.Reddit object at 0x7f12a630cd90>,,ttcafterloss,"Hey guys. So I miscarried last week on Wednesday. I'm still trying to process it all... I basically knew it was happening the second it started. When we got a BFP I was cautiously optimistic due to all the statistics I was reading about spontaneous loss in early pregnancy, so thankfully convinced my DH and immediate family to keep the news to themselves. Thankgod, because I can barely get through talking about it to anyone, even my husband. I feel detached from the whole situation. I’m not angrily wondering “why me?!”, but even though we were taking precautions, I never really thought it would happen to me.

I don’t want to go into graphic details about my MC. But weirdly and coincidentally I went to get my hair done 4 days before it started, and my hairdresser confessed she had a MC in December and DID describe it in graphic detail. Al her graphic details were almost exactly my experience. So as soon as it started happening, I knew. I just knew. And of course I couldn't get into the doctor until almost 24 hours later. So I went online and Googled stuff about MCs  for hours. Almost every single comment I read said bleeding was normal and don't worry. Yeah, right. 

I stayed home from work for the first time in YEARS. It took some mental prep and convincing myself, but finally I figured if there was any time to take a sick day, this was the time. My husband stayed home, too. We went to the doctor and it was confirmed. We went to brunch  and I got a mimosa because why not. We slept all day. The worst of it happened the day before while I was at work, and I was back to work the next day. All in all, the MC lasted 4 days, which is about 1 day longer than my regular period. It was seriously like a maybe-a-little-heavier-than-normal period, and with less cramping. You would think something of this life changing magnitude would be worse.

So. My hairdresser is now 7 weeks pregnant. Only 1 week farther along than I was! But she thought she was farther along - she didn't really know, because she miscarried in December and they got pregnant the next cycle. Accidentally! They weren't trying, especially because they were NTNP in the first place, the doctor told her to hold off at least one cycle, and she was traumatized by it. 

Her story gives me hope. I feel bad I’m not more sad about it all. I am sad in a very selfish way: I allowed myself to get excited, and start planning, because I’m an over planner. We started talking about dates, child care, home improvements, nurseries, and announcements. And then almost as soon as this big life change happened, it wasn’t happening anymore. I’m disappointed all the planning I had done in my head isn’t going AS PLANNED anymore, and it’s not in my control. But I’m not sad about the baby, because it wasn’t a baby yet. I’m not in denial, or angry, or wondering “why me?”. It was too early, my body did exactly what it was supposed to, and we’ll continue trying.

So. I’m still a little sad because it didn’t go as I planned, but I’m hopeful and eager to get pregnant. My coworkers have noticed I’ve cut back on drinking alcohol and wonders about my one day out of the office and have actually hinted to or asked if we’re expecting. Here’s to hoping the old wives tales of getting pregnant soon after a MC is true, so we can pick up where we left off without missing a beat.

We got our BFP last Sunday.  Excitement ensued.  Then the cramps came... horrible, horrible cramps.  Worse than a kidney stone.  Happened for three days.  Finally went to the ER on late Friday night / early Saturday morning.  ER doc & radiologist convinced it was a ruptured ectopic, gyno convinced it was a typical miscarriage.  
Spent the next day in the hospital.  Early yesterday morning, I had my second ultra sound, where they confirmed it was ectopic and I would need surgery to remove both the pregnancy and my left tube.  
  
My first surgery, ever.  It went well, thankfully.  Woke up sobbing after anesthesia [no idea why, lol].  I'm still in quite a bit of physical pain, but emotionally I'm quite stable.  Is this normal?  I know it is still soon and I could just be numb.

I was finally feeling like things started to feel ""normal"" again and then 2 weeks ago I found out I was pregnant. Of course we are very excited, but I'm also terrified. I've been having nightmares about bleeding (even though I never had any bleeding before my MMC) and last night I had a nightmare that I found out I wasn't pregnant. 

The past few days there has been a lot of baby talk - my MIL was talking about all of DH's cousins who are about to have babies in the next few months. And then today DH's best friend told him he'll be in our area all week because his sister (who lives near us) is about to be induced. Hearing about everyone else's perfect pregnancies and how theyre in their third trimester has really gotten to me and today, while DH and I were eating lunch, I made a comment that I would probably just kill myself if we were to lose this baby too. 


I've been having some suicidal thoughts this weekend because I am so overwhelmed with the thought of the onslaught of births that are about to take place. I would never actually do anything, but I made the comment and I couldn't take it back. I know I need to go to therapy and work through what is going on with me. I think in part it's hormones and also just a deep fear that this pregnancy isn't going to work out, but I also think I should have seen a grief counselor right after the MMC happened. We were on expensive insurance at the time and weren't able to afford it, but we've since switched providers and it is covered fully now.

I was finally feeling like things started to feel &quot;normal&quot; again and then 2 weeks ago I found out I was pregnant. Of course we are very excited, but I&#39;m also terrified. I&#39;ve been having nightmares about bleeding (even though I never had any bleeding before my MMC) and last night I had a nightmare that I found out I wasn&#39;t pregnant. </p>

<p>The past few days there has been a lot of baby talk - my MIL was talking about all of DH&#39;s cousins who are about to have babies in the next few months. And then today DH&#39;s best friend told him he&#39;ll be in our area all week because his sister (who lives near us) is about to be induced. Hearing about everyone else&#39;s perfect pregnancies and how theyre in their third trimester has really gotten to me and today, while DH and I were eating lunch, I made a comment that I would probably just kill myself if we were to lose this baby too. </p>

<p>I&#39;ve been having some suicidal thoughts this weekend because I am so overwhelmed with the thought of the onslaught of births that are about to take place.
