After my D&C bleeding stopped I had 2 weeks blood free, then what I assumed was my 1st period for 2.5 days. (wasn't perfect with my temping 100% but there is a temp & RHR shift 12 days prior to the period so I'm assuming that ovulation & LP occurred).

Edit 1/19 if anyone comes across this: What I detailed above was not an actual period. I had residual HCG up until CD 77 & ovulated the next day. That cycle resulted in a CP with 6 days of very faint positive tests, followed by 2 days of spotting (never had LP spotting), a very heavy bleed for 2 days (never heavy before), then 3 days of light, 2 days of spotting.

I've posted here about 3 weeks ago, after getting the diagnose that my son's heart was not properly developed. I don't know the medical term, but the veins from the heart to the lungs where either very underdeveloped, or not existing. The only reason he held on for this long was that I was breathing for him, and therefore his body didn't know that it couldn't on its own.  

November 30th and 00.32 I gave birth to Max Amadeus. He was incredible beautiful and looked like his big brother. 

I am trying to deal with all of this. I am finding a lot of peace in the fact that he was sick and never was suppose to be here. Mother nature just wasn't fast enough in realising that.

&#x200B;

I was wondering how many people here have become pregnant after a miscarriage with no period in between? I was just wondering if you'd be able to answer some questions.

1. Did you carry to term? I heard that women who conceive after a miscarriage have a higher rate of being able to carry to full term. If I was positive again, I would feel petrified of a repeater and a little bit of reassurance would greatly help.
2. When did you feel that you were at ""the safe spot"" to tell people?
3. How did you manage anxiety, if you had it, regarding the change of a repeater?
4. How did your symptoms compared to the previous time? More/less/ the same?

Thanks!

I took Misoprostol on November 27th when I was supposed to be 9 weeks + 1 day.  The three scans (6 weeks, 7.5 weeks, and finally 9 weeks) all showed an empty sac measuring from 6 mm to 7.3 mm (around 5 weeks) each time.  I'm still bleeding from this, which is sometimes very heavy, but no longer have cramps.

My doctor told me there was no need to wait to conceive after that, and I'd like to start as soon as possible.  Of course, I will wait till bleeding stops.  However, I'm curious if there is anyway to track ovulation via OPKs during this time.  I'm really terrible at temping (combination of mouth breathing, getting up to pee in the morning, cat waking me up, etc.)

I've seen that it is helpful to keep testing with HPT to make sure the line is fading.  At this point my line is faint, but it's not completely gone.  However, I also took an OPK and it is a bold positive.  I do know that OPKs can give a false positive if there is HCG present, but I thought it had to be a lot.  I didn't think you would get a positive OPK with a faint HPT.

*Did anyone figure out how to use OPKs after their loss?  Is it possible I'm preparing to ovulate while I'm still experiencing bleeding, or is this likely residual HCG showing?*  Perhaps OPKs are useless until my next period.

I need your help.

I have been taking vitex (1500mg daily) for approximately 4 months (with a break from BFP to MC October/November) due to long anovulatory cycles of \~85 days. I have read so many mixed reviews on it, though.

I've read that it may have CAUSED my miscarriage via a drop in progesterone or the herb itself? I have also read that it can PREVENT miscarriage?

Has anyone used vitex?

Is anyone still using vitex?

Has anyone had a successful pregnancy after using vitex to conceive? (I understand majority may not have had an LC yet)

&#x200B;

I understand that no one here is a doctor but I'm just looking for opinions and experiences.

It only took us one cycle of NTNP and then two tracked cycles to get pregnant the first time. It flew by because by the time I had figured out my temping and tracking cycles, I fell pregnant. I even had a thought of “wow, I got pregnant fast!” and was thanking God for making it easy. 

Well, it ended in a devastating miscarriage. When it happened, I thought to myself “at least I have the rest of the year to get pregnant again”. Now here I am, feeling defeated of failed back to back cycles of trying. It’s taking over double the amount of time now, and I don’t feel any closer due to wonky period signs ever since my MC.

52,2048,confidence,<praw.reddit.Reddit object at 0x7f12a630cd90>,,ttcafterloss,"Hi all. I’m new to this group, recently decided it might be helpful to connect with others who’ve been through what I’ve been through. I miscarried at 6 weeks and had to have a D&C to remove retained tissue. That was about 6 weeks ago.

My doctor told us we could start trying 2 weeks after my D&C, so we did. We tried about every other day for almost two weeks because I wasn’t sure when I was ovulating and OPKs were giving me confusing results.

Leading up to this period I felt suuuuuper pregnant, having all the same symptoms that I did with the first pregnancy. Getting carsick from driving two minutes down the road, feeling nauseous but starving at the same time, having heartburn.  I was sure I had gotten pregnant, and even got a very very faint positive on a FRER. But then I got my period. All this leads me to conclude that I had a chemical pregnancy. 

So this is my first cycle after getting my period back and we are going to try like crazy this cycle too. It’s just so frustrating, because the first pregnancy that I lost would have been amazing timing. I would have been due in June, and I’m planning to start my first teaching job in the fall of 2019. So I would have had all summer home with the baby. It would have been perfect. I should have been perfect. 

I feel like I’m not the same person I was before the miscarriage. It’s without a doubt the hardest thing I’ve ever been through. I know a 6 week loss is nothing like a having a stillborn or a late miscarriage, I cannot even fathom what that is like and I hope I never have to. But even an early loss is extremely devastating. And I wish more people were willing to talk about their miscarriages, because you feel so alone when you’re going through it. I have an amazingly supporting husband, but he seemed to get over it very quickly. I think because it’s not his body, he doesn’t know what it’s like to know you have another person growing inside of you and then have that taken away in an instant. 

And the whole miscarriage process was extremely frustrating, with doctors being very insensitive and dismissive of my feelings. Seeing the word “abort¡on” on my hospital paperwork also made everything worse. I am pro choice but that baby was so incredibly wanted, and seeing that word on my paperwork was very painful. Not sure if anyone else had to experience that.

Its been one the hardest year we have ever faced and im really not ready for it to be over, this was ment to be our year, it was ment to be our turn. 

We tried for years with no success to get pregnant, finally found the right doctors and treatments at the beginning of the year and thought this is it, this will be the year we finally get pregnant. 

And we did, we were pregnant twice this year and yet here we are at Christmas time and there is no baby and there isn't one on the way, and its also close to the due date of our first pregnancy 

Im not ready to accept that this wasnt our year and that its over. Also im not ready to try again just yet.

My husband is feeling  exactly the same. We dont know how to tell everyone that we dont want to come to Christmas lunch and that we really dont feel like celebrating it at all.

I am thinking that low progesterone is the reason I'm having miscarriages. I also believe my estrogen levels are extremely high and there is some sort of imbalance.

I feel like I’m also finding fault in what she does or says so that I have a reason not to hang out with her. But really, I’m jealous and we’re in such different places that I don’t want to hang out with her while she glows in her perfect fucking pregnancy. It feels unhealthy for me to talk to her right now. But I don’t want to not be friends with her in the long term. Any advise as to how to explain this to her, to put our friendship on hold, without hurting her, with being clear and true to myself and also leaving things open? </p>

I read a few articles online or on forums about preseed or astroglide TTC lube, etc. that mentioned using it can give you a higher chance of miscarriage, because it makes it so much easier for the sperm to get where it’s going, that even the bad, damaged, messed up speed can get there very quickly and be the first.. 

I was wondering if anyone else heard about that and/or if it may have been a significant factor in your loss(es)? 

My most recent loss most likely had chromosomal issues, and I’m terrified that might happen again, but I don’t produce much CM naturally, so the TTC line helps a lot! Thoughts?

Mods, I hope this is okay to post here, it just seemed like the most likely place to post and get answers!

My husband and I went to the hospital on saturday night because I was having regular contractions at 40 wks +3 days. We were super excited in the anticipation of meeting our baby girl soon.
 
Once we were in triage the nurses frantically tried to find her heart beat. I just kept thinking, ""She's fine. They just can't find it. I just felt her moving not that long ago. They must be mistaken.""  They admitted us to a room in a private area away from other people. The doctor came in and searched for her heart beat on the ultrasound. ""I'm sorry, your baby is deceased."" My only response to this was, ""What?""  I just kept repeating it over and over again. There's no way it could be real.. I had to be dreaming an extremely terrible nightmare I was going to wake up from. Then they told me I had to deliver her. I looked at my husband and told him, I can't do it. I asked the doctor if I could have a c-section and she said no. I had to deliver her. My heart broke even more. So while my husband and I were coming to terms with our daughter's death they prepped me for labor. I just laid there feeling each contraction and asking, ""Why? I just want to take my baby home."" They gave me an epidural and I was able to relax a little bit.

Neither one of us slept much that night. Sunday my husband began informing family. We were then overwhelmed by family coming in to see us. 

At 10:57am I gave birth to our sweet baby girl Ava. She was the most beautiful thing I've ever seen. She was held and loved by everyone.
 
The nurses made molds of her hands and feet for us to take home. They gave us a lock of her hair. One of the nurses was a photographer and took photos of Ava. I'm so grateful for the amazing staff at the hospital and all they did for us and our family.

My husband and I have grieved together and separately, but we've been there for each other through it all and I know we will continue to be. We just keep telling each other we have to take it one day at a time and that its okay to grieve and it's okay to talk about her. She was our daughter and always will be.

It was about DNA fragmentation and SA. I recently fuond I have low progesterone (3.6 at 9DPO). I am hoping that is our issue on what caused a MC, and that it will help us become pregnant again. BUT, this just set me over the edge. It's completely out of our control, and I am a total control freak when it comes to my body. Also, my insurance doesn't cover infertility, so anything extra would be barely covered, if at all.

When I (22f) was pregnant for the fourth time after three miscarriages my sister found out she was also pregnant. I went into premature labor with my daughter and was in active labor for 3 full days after which my water broke and my Songbird (nickname) was born.

 When I told my family I was in labor none of them came to see me. But worse my sister blamed me. She blamed my pre-knowlege drinking (a single wine cooler), blamed my continued smoking, blamed my abusive relationship. I should have fixed them. I tried to. I failed a lot. She acted as if she was guiltless of all of these, she wasn't. 

I held my baby her whole life, 6 beautiful hours. That was it. I held her for three full days. I slept with her in my arms, panicked when I needed to pee because I would have to put her down. I would leave my bathroom door open so I could still see her. The nurses tried for two days to take her from me but I threw a fit like a toddler, grasping to my baby's body for my own life. It was the only thing grounding me.

My sister's pregnancy continued, for what seemed like forever. She went into labor at 32 weeks. Her son lived. It seemed so unfair. She didn't even WANT kids! I have ALWAYS wanted kids! Since I was 7 or 8!!! All I could think when I looked at her was ""It isn't fair!"" And how much I was jealous and how I hated her. I even thought of running off with her baby. She is a good mom most of the time. 

I am nearly four years after these events. My life has continued to be shattered, and scattered. I piece of my heart stuck years behind the rest of me and the rest of it begging to be allowed to be happy.

I don't want to heal because if I feel healed I will feel like I am forgetting. Forgetting is my worst nightmare. Forgetting her birthday, her smell, her feel as I kissed her or her weight on my chest. Forgetting how tiny she was in comparison to how mighty she felt kicking my ribs. Forgetting that she was actually REAL.

95,2048,confidence,<praw.reddit.Reddit object at 0x7f12a630cd90>,,ttcafterloss,"Hello.  I am a long time lurker and first time poster.  I have had 3 losses since July of this year.  It's been a rough 6 months.  Lately I've been angry. Angry at any and everything.  But today, I am particularly angry with my doctors.  I'm wondering if everyone else has similar experience with their doctors...if the standard of care for handling miscarriages is universally abysmal or if I have (yet again) found myself unlucky.

So think of it as a vent/is this normal post?

1. Can they not put a sticky note or a giant fluorescent label on my chart saying ""lost multiple pregnancies...sensitive AF""?!?  Last time I called to say I was pregnant the nurse was all super chipper and bubbly with her ""Congratulations!"" and it just really pissed me off.  And every.single.time I talk to the nurse on the phone asking a question about yet another miscarriage or about what to try next she keeps asking ""were ya'll trying?""  Ummm...yes lady,  trying harder than you are at your job!
2. Everyone is entitled to their opinions on abort!on.  However, when my last pregnancy was deemed unviable and I had a trip to Disney world the next week...I'm sorry, I am not an awful person for wanting to take a pill and start the miscarriage before I am surrounded by children in the world's most unhappiest place to have a miscarriage.  Am I right?  My doctor refused.  I miscarried at Disney world.  I feel I at least deserve a t-shit that says that.
3. After 3 I decided it was time to seek out the help of an RE.  My OB/GYN did not refer me to one. I found one on google and tried him out.  For our first visit he wanted to order 3 tests: a thyroid panel on me, chromosome analysis on my husband (because I already had one live birth), and a natural killer cell test on me.  After the appointment, and before the lab tests were drawn, I went home and did some research.  From what I have found, the plasma test for the natural killer cells is not very reliable, and the treatment doesn't seem to have solid double-blind, placebo-controlled, peer-reviewed research to back it up yet.  Maybe one day it will, but for now I would rather start with things that are more tried and true.  So before the blood drawing I asked if we could hold off on that one.  The nurse said it was fine, but 30 minutes after we left the clinic I got a call from the RE.  He was furious.  He yelled at me over the phone like I was a child.  He told me I shouldn't be doing my own research and that ""He told me it was experimental, and I needed to trust him.""  Obviously I trust him less now.  My husband and I have decided we will not go back to him.  We are waiting on the test results from his chromosome test, but after that we will have no contact with the clinic.
4. Finally, my tipping point today that has thrown me into the deep end of mental instability.  3 weeks ago I took a blood test with my OB/GYN (before ever seeing the RE) for a thrombophilia panel.  They told me it would take about 2 weeks to get the results.  Monday I called to check on the results and the nurse told me that yes, they had the test results back, but the doctor would be calling me to discuss the results.  Here we are, Wednesday, no results from the doctor.  My doctor's office is closed on Thursdays every week.  So the absolute earliest I'll hear the results would be Friday, a full 5 days after they confirmed receipt of the results.  This feels like unnecessary torture.  I mean, I paid for the tests, don't I have the right to know the result??

So, anyway...Thanks for reading, I really needed to get all that off my chest.

Last time I called to say I was pregnant the nurse was all super chipper and bubbly with her &quot;Congratulations!&quot; and it just really pissed me off.  And every.single.time I talk to the nurse on the phone asking a question about yet another miscarriage or about what to try next she keeps asking &quot;were ya&#39;ll trying?&quot;  Ummm...yes lady,  trying harder than you are at your job!</li>
<li>Everyone is entitled to their opinions on abort!on.  However, when my last pregnancy was deemed unviable and I had a trip to Disney world the next week...I&#39;m sorry, I am not an awful person for wanting to take a pill and start the miscarriage before I am surrounded by children in the world&#39;s most unhappiest place to have a miscarriage.  Am I right?  My doctor refused.  I miscarried at Disney world.  I feel I at least deserve a t-shit that says that.</li>
<li>After 3 I decided it was time to seek out the help of an RE.  My OB/GYN did not refer me to one. I found one on google and tried him out.  For our first visit he wanted to order 3 tests: a thyroid panel on me, chromosome analysis on my husband (because I already had one live birth), and a natural killer cell test on me.  After the appointment, and before the lab tests were drawn, I went home and did some research.  From what I have found, the plasma test for the natural killer cells is not very reliable, and the treatment doesn&#39;t seem to have solid double-blind, placebo-controlled, peer-reviewed research to back it up yet.  Maybe one day it will, but for now I would rather start with things that are more tried and true.  So before the blood drawing I asked if we could hold off on that one.  The nurse said it was fine, but 30 minutes after we left the clinic I got a call from the RE.  He was furious.  He yelled at me over the phone like I was a child.  He told me I shouldn&#39;t be doing my own research and that &quot;He told me it was experimental, and I needed to trust him.&quot;  Obviously I trust him less now.  My husband and I have decided we will not go back to him.  We are waiting on the test results from his chromosome test, but after that we will have no contact with the clinic.</li>
<li>Finally, my tipping point today that has thrown me into the deep end of mental instability.  3 weeks ago I took a blood test with my OB/GYN (before ever seeing the RE) for a thrombophilia panel.  They told me it would take about 2 weeks to get the results.  Monday I called to check on the results and the nurse told me that yes, they had the test results back, but the doctor would be calling me to discuss the results.  Here we are, Wednesday, no results from the doctor.  My doctor&#39;s office is closed on Thursdays every week.  So the absolute earliest I&#39;ll hear the results would be Friday, a full 5 days after they confirmed receipt of the results.  This feels like unnecessary torture.  I mean, I paid for the tests, don&#39;t I have the right to know the result??</li>
</ol>

<p>So, anyway...Thanks for reading, I really needed to get all that off my chest.  Anyone else hate doctors this week?</p>

I am currently 3 days post ERPC here. Full story is in my post history but essentially this followed a MMC and incomplete 'natural' MC.

We are clear to start trying straight away, with the usual caveat that dating is tricky in the unlikely event that we are successful immediately.

Our plan is to go with NTNP until the new year. It took us 8 months to conceive and we were both getting tired of all the tracking and regimented sex.

I think I need to let DH have control of the pregnancy tests as if I have them it's just peepee central. Currently I'm thinking to do a weekly test to track the hormones down until my next period, then after that first cycle, only test if I go beyond 28 days, and then max once to twice a week. My cycles were short before and I've read lots of people saying they had a few short LPs after MC so doubt I'll be testing much!

I'd love to hear your thoughts on the plan - pros and (especially) cons. If I work through them all now, I think I'll be less likely to waver in my resolve and jump straight back on the tracking train.

115,2048,confidence,<praw.reddit.Reddit object at 0x7f12a630cd90>,,ttcafterloss,"At the beginning of November I gave birth to my son at 18 weeks. I suffered from a premature rupture of the membranes and went into early labour. My waters broke while I was sleeping. It was my first pregnancy. 

I feel guilty admitting it sometimes because I know a lot of people take a long time to conceive but we got pregnant after the first time of trying. I live in Japan where even for a healthy pregnancy you have a scan around every 2 weeks until you're 16 weeks pregnant and then monthly until 26 weeks then again more regularly until the birth. Every scan I had was healthy and so were the blood tests - there was nothing indicating this was going to happen. I know that this just happens sometimes, although it's relatively uncommon after the 1st trimester. But, I sort of wish there was a reason. I'm having trouble understanding how something like this can happen when we were both healthy. 

18 weeks is sort of the weird limbo stage where I was too far along to pass the baby naturally at home, but too early to try and save the baby. The doctor said that it was extremely unlikely I would make it to 22 weeks, which is the point where they can try and save the baby outside the womb. If I did make it that far, the baby would likely die anyway as it would be extremely underdeveloped because of the lack of amniotic fluid. They hurried my labour along by inserting those stick things into my cervix, then some medicine. Over all I was in labour for around 6 hours. 

I live in a small town in the countryside and the maternity unit is extremely small and they don't have babies born every day. The one thing I just can't shake out of my head is the sadness of the nurses. One nurse was crying. It was obviously something they hadn't experienced very often. 

As soon as I get the all clear from the doctor and my periods return, I want to try again for a baby although my husband is hesitant. It seems the advice here is to wait 6 months after a loss. In the UK and US, as far as I can tell (please correct me if I'm wrong) if they doctor says OK then you can start trying as soon as you feel comfortable. One of the hardest things to get used to about being pregnant is just how different the approach is to pregnancy. 

My body has recovered but my mental health is suffering. I can't sleep at all and have anxiety. I wonder if we can ever make a baby again. What if this was my only chance?! What if there is something wrong with me and I can never carry to term? I haven't really spoken to anyone since this has happened, other than my husband and his family. I deleted my Facebook and Instagram. I've been married legally for a while but a month before the loss, we had a wedding ceremony and after we told my family we were expecting. Everyone was so excited. My friend sent me a present to use during pregnancy. It arrived on the day of the baby's funeral. My friend didn't even think to give me a heads up. It would be my parents first grandchild. My mum had started knitting. 

I can't face talking to anyone about it, so I just wanted to write something down. Although getting used to the medical system here was hard, I'm so happy I live so far away from people who want to help me. Maybe it sounds selfish but I'm not ready to talk to my friends or family yet. My due date was the beginning of April and I'm dreading it. I feel like I can't move on until after that date has passed. Every week is a different milestone that I can't experience anymore.

<p>I feel guilty admitting it sometimes because I know a lot of people take a long time to conceive but we got pregnant after the first time of trying. I live in Japan where even for a healthy pregnancy you have a scan around every 2 weeks until you&#39;re 16 weeks pregnant and then monthly until 26 weeks then again more regularly until the birth. Every scan I had was healthy and so were the blood tests - there was nothing indicating this was going to happen. I know that this just happens sometimes, although it&#39;s relatively uncommon after the 1st trimester. But, I sort of wish there was a reason. I&#39;m having trouble understanding how something like this can happen when we were both healthy. </p>

<p>18 weeks is sort of the weird limbo stage where I was too far along to pass the baby naturally at home, but too early to try and save the baby. The doctor said that it was extremely unlikely I would make it to 22 weeks, which is the point where they can try and save the baby outside the womb. If I did make it that far, the baby would likely die anyway as it would be extremely underdeveloped because of the lack of amniotic fluid. They hurried my labour along by inserting those stick things into my cervix, then some medicine. Over all I was in labour for around 6 hours. </p>

<p>I live in a small town in the countryside and the maternity unit is extremely small and they don&#39;t have babies born every day. The one thing I just can&#39;t shake out of my head is the sadness of the nurses. One nurse was crying. It was obviously something they hadn&#39;t experienced very often. </p>

<p>As soon as I get the all clear from the doctor and my periods return, I want to try again for a baby although my husband is hesitant. It seems the advice here is to wait 6 months after a loss. In the UK and US, as far as I can tell (please correct me if I&#39;m wrong) if they doctor says OK then you can start trying as soon as you feel comfortable. One of the hardest things to get used to about being pregnant is just how different the approach is to pregnancy. </p>

<p>My body has recovered but my mental health is suffering. I can&#39;t sleep at all and have anxiety. I wonder if we can ever make a baby again. What if this was my only chance?! What if there is something wrong with me and I can never carry to term? I haven&#39;t really spoken to anyone since this has happened, other than my husband and his family. I deleted my Facebook and Instagram. I&#39;ve been married legally for a while but a month before the loss, we had a wedding ceremony and after we told my family we were expecting. Everyone was so excited. My friend sent me a present to use during pregnancy. It arrived on the day of the baby&#39;s funeral. My friend didn&#39;t even think to give me a heads up. It would be my parents first grandchild. My mum had started knitting. </p>

<p>I can&#39;t face talking to anyone about it, so I just wanted to write something down. Although getting used to the medical system here was hard, I&#39;m so happy I live so far away from people who want to help me. Maybe it sounds selfish but I&#39;m not ready to talk to my friends or family yet. My due date was the beginning of April and I&#39;m dreading it. I feel like I can&#39;t move on until after that date has passed. Every week is a different milestone that I can&#39;t experience anymore. </p>

I stumbled upon this thread while I was reading a post from r/pregnant. I'm hoping you all might be able to help  me help my best friend through the holidays this year after the loss of her infant last February. 

A bit of backstory...last year at this time my best friend and I were pregnant together- she was due in February and I in July. Her entire pregnancy was textbook...her labor...not so much. I can't say much more than that for legal reasons, but I will say that her beautiful daughter lived for one day on life support before taking her off it. 

Fast forward a few months to May...I am getting bigger and my friend has growing PTSD from their birthing experience. I text and talk with her, but I can tell it's much harder for her to be around me. I send her a letter and a friendship bracelet (cheesy, I know) letting her know that nothing will happen to our friendship, even if we have to drop contact for a while. I just wanted to be there for her, but the circumstances were just overwhelming her. 

Fast forward a but more...I now have a five month old son. Two other friends of hers have also had kids (both bridesmaids of hers who became pregnant right after she lost her daughter...). 

Through it all, we text, and some talking when she's up for it. I just wish that I could take her pain away, or even help her just a little instead of feeling completely helpless given the impossible circumstances. 

My question is...how can I help her through the holidays and beyond? Is there something that I could do besides just keeping my distance until she's ready (yes, I know that's vital and I'm not about to screw it up).

133,2048,confidence,<praw.reddit.Reddit object at 0x7f12a630cd90>,,ttcafterloss,"I’m a 32 year old female who, when asked what I wanted to be when I grew up in my kindergarten class, sheepishly replied “a mom.” 

Except for a brief moment in my 20’s - distracted by partying and the care-free lifestyle that comes along with it, being a mother has been a forever dream of mine. Since graduating college at the ripe old age of 24 (told you, I partied) building a life for myself and setting the foundation to someday have a family has become a focus. I spent the next 6+ years in failed relationship after failed relationship. Never a step closer to happiness and certainly no closer to my forever dream of a someday family. 

About a year and a half ago, I found myself living a life full of first dates, hardly any second dates, and third dates started to feel like a fairytale. In short, I was burnt out. I didn’t want to keep dating; I was looking for something meaningful and real and lasting. I wanted to give up, but short of finding a magic lamp with a magical genie hiding inside, I knew giving up would get me even that much NOT closer to what I was seeking. 

Suddenly, I did find something magical. A man walked into my life who was seemingly average and ordinary at first. The first date was fun, but they all were. I didn’t expect a second date, until he asked for one and I happily complied. Surely that was the end of that - third dates were make believe after all. To my surprise there was a third date, then a forth, and fifth, then suddenly I found myself in a loving and committed relationship. A year and a half later I still look at him with starry-eyes. His love and adoration for me is surpassed only by the love and respect I feel for him. Ok, that’s as mushy as I’m going to get, I promise, just setting the stage. 

So about 11 weeks ago we decided we were ready to take the next step in our relationship. Turned out he wants a family just as deeply as I do. We decided to start trying. Oh, for the sake of keeping this already long post, less long, I skimmed over the fact that we were already living together and engaged at this point. 

Fortunately, 10 weeks and 4 days ago we became pregnant. We only found out about it 4 weeks and 5 days ago. Horray! We were absolutely elated! We decided, we acted, and it happened! We realized exactly how fortunate we were knowing that becoming pregnant so quickly is quite rare, especially for a couple of our age (32 and 39). 

We decided to wait to announce to our families until an ultrasound confirmed a heartbeat. That would make it real, and all the research we had done assured that after a strong fetal heartbeat had been detected, the risk of miscarriage fell dramatically. We falsely assured ourselves we would be in “the safe zone.” 

The day of the ultrasound came. Baby’s heartbeat was strong and clear as ever, 159 BPM at 8 weeks. WE WERE HAVING A BABY! A lifelong dream of both of ours being fulfilled. A miracle in the making. We announced on my dad’s birthday by presenting to him a framed sonogram, with my entire family present. We all cried and laughed and hugged. It was a hallmark moment for sure. 

Thanksgiving, 5 days later, again the whole family was together and conversation focused on the new life growing inside me. Before the evening was over, I went to the bathroom and discovered small blood clots left behind. I panicked, excused myself from the rest of the evening festivities and figured all I needed was a good nights rest. 

The next day, Black Friday, 6 hours in the ER and an ultrasound confirmed that strong fluttering heartbeat was gone, and it would only be a matter of time before my body would expel our little miracle. 

We were pregnant for 10 weeks and 4 days. And now, after 2 days of rest and trying to cope, we’re back to the beginning - wanting to try again, but with a new layer of insecurity and eerie-ness. 

I feel defeated. That old, familiar feeling of wanting to give up has sunk in again. I realize that this was only our first “try” and so many, many couples try for years only to end up disappointed. Considering this I should count myself as lucky that I even made it this far. But this pain is real. Physically I am exhausted, emotionally I am taxed. I do not feel “lucky” that I at least got pregnant, even though I lost it. What I do feel “lucky” about is that I have this amazing man standing next to me, holding me up and supporting me through what has been the hardest thing I’ve tried to get through in my life so far. 

Life is full of crazy, unexplainable, gloriously beautiful and horribly tragic experiences. I’m so glad I have someone to help me navigate them now, and I’m enthusiastic about finding out how the next experience with him will turn out.

A week ago I noticed that of COURSE the baby announcements were tallying up like crazy on my FB and IG feeds. The final straw was a fashion blogger (whom I really do adore and coincidentally also went to high school with) announcing her pregnancy in a beautiful, holiday-themed maternity dress reveal. 

Since then I’ve managed to make a conscious and deliberate effort to stay off of IG and Facebook. I know it’s only been 7 days but WOW it has really made such a tremendous difference. I’ve felt noticeable shifts in the way I recognize and feel good about the little things in my life and a decrease in moments of wanting, longing or jealousy for things that others posses (material or in their lifestyle). 

So putting a plug here on yet another “self-care Sunday” (please self-care every day, fam!!) to give this experiment a try. It may really help, either for a short-stint or a long-term digital vacation. I’m not planning to log back in anytime soon and it feels pretty damn freeing.

150,2048,confidence,<praw.reddit.Reddit object at 0x7f12a630cd90>,,ttcafterloss,"Hi there,

It's supposed to be a weekend full of love and gratitude, but for me, it's just sad and empty.  I imagine many of you feel this way too right now. I'm sorry we're here. The wounds are still very raw, but I thought that introducing myself and sharing my story might help me process. I'm sorry this is long and please feel free to scroll past this post if my experience is triggering, but things went from normal to devastating so quickly and I'm still trying to come to terms with what the hell just happened.

About two weeks ago, at 13 weeks, I went in for the NT scan. I was so scared about something being wrong with the baby that I didn't consider my body might be the problem. I had a LEEP done in 2009 so they checked my cervix, which is apparently short, raising red flags. The baby looked great (confirmed later with lab results), but I would need a cerclage. The risks seemed minimal and the perinatologist and my OB/GYN both seemed confident this was a simple, preventative measure.

I had a transvaginal cerclage placed last Tuesday. My OB/GYN informed me that it was difficult to place because the doctor who did the LEEP did a shoddy job on my cervix and it's asymmetrical. They put me on indocin for 48 hours to avoid uterine contractions. On Wednesday I was back at work and felt a little cramping and light spotting, but otherwise normal. 

By Thursday, I was no longer on the indocin, and started having horrible, debilitating contractions and a lot of discharge. I was told discharge was normal post-cerclage, but this seemed excessive. They had me come back to the hospital Friday and confirmed I was having contractions. The baby was positioned with her head pushing at my cervix. The cerclage appeared to be unraveling. The ultrasound showed a heartbeat of 144. I remember thinking that seemed low because it had been at 163 before, but 144 is still normal. Amniotic fluid looked fine.

The doctor was concerned but we seemed to still have options. The goal was to calm my uterus, so she put me back on indocin and ordered immediate bed rest. She called me later that night after mulling further on it and said she was concerned about infection. She ordered blood work and had me come back to the hospital on Saturday, warning me to go to the ER immediately if anything happened between now and then.

On Saturday, at 15 weeks, I got to the hospital and started bleeding heavily. Since I was already at the hospital, I went to perinatology first to inform them. My perinatologist was on call and my OB/GYN wasn't even on that day, but the nurses were so kind and understanding, and they sent me to labor & delivery to wait. 

While I waited for the OB/GYN on call, they ordered an ultrasound and the tech said nothing. She called my perinatologist who said she and my OB/GYN were coming in to talk. The ultrasound tech just said, ""I'm sorry."" I knew then it was over, but I wanted so badly for my doctors to be coming in with an emergency plan.

The heartbeat that I saw Friday was gone on Saturday. She didn't make it.

My body clearly couldn't handle the cerclage but there was also infection based on my WBC. I was told that with or without the surgery, this would not have been a viable pregnancy. I'm having such a hard accepting this because things were looking great before the cerclage. And while it likely escalated things, the reality is it was a perfect shitty storm of issues that I never even imagined going into this pregnancy.

For now, I am focusing on healing my body and my heart, but it's going to be a long road to get back to where I was. It's hard to know how to feel about trying again right now, because I still don't fully understand what happened. 

If it was totally random and infection caused the loss, I have to accept that the odds weren't in my favor and try to have faith that it's less likely to happen again. I will need also a transabdominal cerclage, which they recommend putting in before you start trying, which means I'll have to have another surgery first and eventually try to have faith that it will work this time. I wish it was as easy as just starting to try again, but I will do whatever I have to.

If you made it this far, thanks for reading my story. I don't know if I'm ready to jump back in yet, but if anyone has experience with transabdominal cerclage, I would love to hear from you.",t2_7poht,False,,0,False,Struggling to understand,[],r/ttcafterloss,False,0,,0,,,False,t3_9zs8qx,False,dark,0.96,,public,22,0,{},,ce4ab51a-711f-11e4-826c-12313d148545,False,[],,False,False,,{},,False,22,,False,self,False,,[],{},,True,,1543037143.0,text,0,,,text,self.ttcafterloss,False,"<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=""md""><p>Hi there,</p>

&#x200B;

I've had several pregnancies that have all ended in m/c. I am very lucky that I am able to catch every single time I try. I'm just unlucky that I can't hold on to them. My husband and I tried this month, I def. ovulated so I felt as if I would catch as I always do. Usually when I'm pregnant I have hot flashes, sore breast, morning sickness, the works. This time I'm 7 dpo and have no symptoms what so ever. Of course it could mean I did not catch this month. Usually by now I would feel off and run hot. 

&#x200B;

I'm just wondering, if anyone had a successful pregnancy with no symptoms what so ever? (of course until week 6 or 7)

<p>&#x200B;</p>

<p>I&#39;ve had several pregnancies that have all ended in m/c. I am very lucky that I am able to catch every single time I try. I&#39;m just unlucky that I can&#39;t hold on to them. My husband and I tried this month, I def. ovulated so I felt as if I would catch as I always do. Usually when I&#39;m pregnant I have hot flashes, sore breast, morning sickness, the works. This time I&#39;m 7 dpo and have no symptoms what so ever. Of course it could mean I did not catch this month. Usually by now I would feel off and run hot. </p>

I had a MMC in the summer. I walked around for 3 weeks without knowing it was already over. I was disappointed but I knew that miscarriage was a possibility. I knew that chances were it wouldn't happen again. Everyone told me the same things that did make me feel better. It wasn't a viable embryo. It happens all the time. 

We conceived after one cycle. I was so nervous and scared. At the ultrasound at 7+6 I cried when they showed me the heartbeat. It measured on time and had a great heartbeat. I thought we were on the good side of the statistics. Just in case I checked the miscarriage reassurance website every day. Got all the way down to 2%. 

Started bleeding. Ultrasound showed the embryo had died a few days after the first ultrasound. I walked around again for a few weeks thinking everything was fine when it wasn't. I felt so devastated. How could this happen twice?

This time I feel a lot differently. It is not comforting in the least to know that it wasn't a viable embryo. It makes me extra sad to think that we created two bad embryos in a row. I don't think we will be able to move on and feel excited next time about being pregnant. I think it will forever feel like a nightmare waiting to unfold. What's the joy in that?

I don't even know if my husband wants to try again, and I'm hesitant to ask because I don't want him to say no. I don't even know how much I want to try again either, but I also don't want to have been pregnant for six months already this year for nothing. I just don't want to be scared, but the price for that is this empty feeling forever. That's not a fair trade.  

Also, I hate how quickly I went from happily pregnant to feeling like I was dying in the emergency room to completely recovered and back to normal life. Like, really, it's all over? Just like that?

176,2048,confidence,<praw.reddit.Reddit object at 0x7f12a630cd90>,,ttcafterloss,"Hey y'all, I'm not sure I'm entirely in the right place as my fiance and I are not currently TTC and won't be for another 2-3 years, as we're long distance and just working on immigration stuff etc. But here goes. I had an unplanned IUD failure pregnancy in the spring (the IUD was a couple weeks past the 5 year mark, but still, it was a pretty rare situation) that ended in a MMC at 7 weeks. The gestational sac was full of cysts and the baby wasn't developing properly, so they assumed it was a genetic defect, but I've been having some concerning symptoms for months/years and I'm wondering if I could have PCOS and if that could both have caused the miscarriage and may cause problems for me in the future. Obviously I'm not asking strangers on the internet to diagnose me, but I am looking for some guidance.

My symptoms:

\- My periods have always been regular pre-IUD, but my cycles are actually quite short (21-23 days) and my periods have been very heavy and painful. I don't get periods with the IUD (Mirena) though. (I got it replaced when I had my D+C because the chances of it failing again are so low.)

\- I was diagnosed with stage 1 endometriosis at 19, but it was all surgically removed and I assumed it hasn't been a problem since. It did definitely decrease the pain with my periods but not the heaviness.

\- I had HORRIBLE cystic acne until I took spironolactone for about a year and a half several years back. I am no longer on it but thankfully the worst of the acne didn't recur. I still have near-constant minor breakouts on my chin though.

\- I am quite hairy for a cis woman. I have a goddamn beard. Literally, if I didn't shave or wax I would have a full-on neck beard and hair on other parts of my face as well. I have to shave my chin/neck every few days - honestly it should probably be every day but I'm lazy. The facial hair has gotten a lot worse in the last year or two. There is definitely growth there that wasn't there a year ago.

\- Weight gain. I'm not obese and am naturally curvy, but I've been steadily gaining weight for the last year or so without a significant change in diet or medication. My weight is mostly in my belly and boobs and I also feel like I have kind of a fat face, TBH.

Now, I should note, I did have an ultrasound over two years ago that didn't show any cysts (it was for unexplained abdominal pain that turned out to probably be GI-related), which is good. I had a hormone panel when I was 14 that showed high levels of DHEAS but everything else was in normal ranges. Now, that was 12 years ago and I have not had such a test since.

Honestly, I've suspected this for a couple of years but I haven't talked to my doctor about it for a stupid reason. It's so I can avoid hearing what I don't want to hear. Honestly, I want to be a mom so badly and hearing that I'm mostly infertile or likely to have recurrent miscarriages would completely break my heart. I also can't do fuck all about it for 2-3 years (my fiance doesn't want to start trying for kids until then, and his reasoning for that is sound.)

So, like...what do I do? Is this worth pursuing with my doctor? Could PCOS be what's causing my symptoms and could it have caused my miscarriage? And like if I have it is there anything I could do to increase my chances of getting pregnant and carrying to term, short of doing IVF?

&#x200B;

Today I find my self here looking for strength, hope, and trying to find myself again. I am new here. I am 34 years old. I have a little girl that is 12 from a previous marriage. My husband and I just lost our little girl at 19 weeks 2 days due to my water breaking at 16w 1 day. I spent 3 long weeks in the hospital trying my best to keep her with us. No fever/infection. Started having contractions 2 weeks after being in the hospital for 4 days then they stop and nothing for 4 days I felt amazing her heart rate was always great then it happen. I just felt myself loosing her. I thought I was in the clear I had stopped leaking fluid for days. I was excited to think maybe the bag had healed or something but I was wrong. I had Emilia Hope at 12:09 pm on Sunday Sept 30th. 

&#x200B;

I have never felt so lost in my life. With the holidays coming up I just can't escape this feeling like something is just missing. The last few months have been hard. We lost our sweet baby girl and a week later my husband lost his job due to the company closing. We have moved into his grandma's old house that his cousin has trashed and I am grateful to have it. It's just a lot of work. I feel like I haven't had a moment to breath since we lost Emilia. We have been here for about a month and are just getting a stove and fridge tomorrow. When we first moved in we had no washer or dryer either. Hoping things will feel a little more normal when I get this house sorted. Though we are trying to live out of boxes b.c we know we will be moving again when my husband finds another job. I just feel like I can't relax at all. Like I am always on edge. I am always thinking of Emilia. When even the littlest thing goes wrong I just cry. I feel like i have a cup and it is right on the edge of flowing over then something happens and it just over flows.

<p>&#x200B;</p>

<p>Today I find my self here looking for strength, hope, and trying to find myself again. I am new here. I am 34 years old. I have a little girl that is 12 from a previous marriage. My husband and I just lost our little girl at 19 weeks 2 days due to my water breaking at 16w 1 day. I spent 3 long weeks in the hospital trying my best to keep her with us. No fever/infection. Started having contractions 2 weeks after being in the hospital for 4 days then they stop and nothing for 4 days I felt amazing her heart rate was always great then it happen. I just felt myself loosing her. I thought I was in the clear I had stopped leaking fluid for days. I was excited to think maybe the bag had healed or something but I was wrong. I had Emilia Hope at 12:09 pm on Sunday Sept 30th. </p>

<p>&#x200B;</p>

<p>I have never felt so lost in my life. With the holidays coming up I just can&#39;t escape this feeling like something is just missing. The last few months have been hard. We lost our sweet baby girl and a week later my husband lost his job due to the company closing. We have moved into his grandma&#39;s old house that his cousin has trashed and I am grateful to have it. It&#39;s just a lot of work. I feel like I haven&#39;t had a moment to breath since we lost Emilia. We have been here for about a month and are just getting a stove and fridge tomorrow. When we first moved in we had no washer or dryer either. Hoping things will feel a little more normal when I get this house sorted. Though we are trying to live out of boxes b.c we know we will be moving again when my husband finds another job. I just feel like I can&#39;t relax at all. Like I am always on edge. I am always thinking of Emilia. When even the littlest thing goes wrong I just cry. I feel like i have a cup and it is right on the edge of flowing over then something happens and it just over flows. It was getting better but seems with Thanksgiving coming up that it is just getting worse again. I just was so looking forward to being pregnant this thanks giving and looking forward to having her. I just feel sad all the time. </p>

We’ve been through 1 miscarriage at 11 weeks in 2015 and a still birth at 22 weeks from placental failure in 2017. I  have had tests done including a Sono histogram, blood work to check my thyroid, and antibodies, plus a few other. I am RH negative and my partner is positive. The first time we became pregnant they didn’t check my blood type and did not give me the rhogam shot which is needed so that my body does not attack the baby while it develops. The second time I was pregnant I had bleeding during the pregnancy so I was given extra rhogam shots as a precaution. All the tests I’ve had have come back normal or within normal range, but in the second pregnancy the placenta was 60% none functioning. The doctors keep telling us that we are young and healthy it will happen, and all the other things they say to try and make you feel better. So far we have worked with genetic specialists, and a neonatal specialist. We just recently made a consultation appointment with a fertility endocrinologist specialist, trying to get some sort of answers as to why this is not working for us. I am hopeful that we will have success with the fertility doctor, but nervous that we will continue to have problems or they will decide to not take us on as patients. 

I feel conflicted in the aspect that I don’t think I can go through labor and give birth to another still born child, but we want so badly to have a family. The risk seems worth the reward, I just don’t know how much more I can take. Every month when I start my period I feel like a complete failure, my whole large family are very fertile and all have at least 1 child most have 3-4 without any kind of problems. I try to stay positive, but find myself angry when I see people who are not trying to get pregnant or not financially or maturely ready to have children just pumping them out on accident. I have been having trouble socializing with people because of this, it seems like everyone around us is pregnant or have new babies. 

I don’t like expressing my feelings when it comes to this matter as I feel like people (who have never had these problems) tell me they understand when unless you’ve been through it you really can’t understand the daily pain and stress. My partner is my best friend and we have a good relationship, but he does not handle things well so I try not to express my real concerns with him in this matter. I don’t feel like he understands how much this impacts me as a woman or the daily heartache I feel from having to burry our son, or the fear I feel trying to do this all again.  They always tell you once you are in the second trimester that you are in the “clear” because your risk of complications decreases, after the experiences we have had just thinking about being pregnant again makes me anxious I have had bad experience at both Obgyn’s I’ve been to which makes it hard to have any kind of confidence in any Obgyn going forward.

I actually don’t know how far I was because I have PCOS and my cycles are totally ridiculous. That one was hard but I was ready to give it another go. 

I got pregnant on our first cycle of a Clomid in September. We had three ultrasounds because I found out basically right after I conceived. The first two were perfect. I was 6w2d at the second scan and we saw the hb and everything was right on schedule. I had my third and last ultrasound two weeks later on Thursday and there was no heartbeat. The baby measured 6w4d. My OB said the same thing he said when I had my CP - there was just something wrong with the baby and it didn’t make it. I had a d&c on Friday. I’m still very, very sad. This one feels so much worse. 

My husband has already made up his mind that he wants to try again. I do not know if I can do this again. I already worried so much about losing the baby and I felt very emboldened by the fact that we saw the hb, among other things. I was sure it was going to stick.

So I guess my question is how do you try again and keep your sanity? Everything that gave me reassurance and strength this time means dick because we still ended up losing the baby.

196,2048,confidence,<praw.reddit.Reddit object at 0x7f12a630cd90>,,ttcafterloss,"Hi.  I noticed that people introduce themselves and their situations on this sub.  So here I am, following suit.  First, I hate that I'm even here (please don't take it the wrong way but, like most of you, I would prefer to not even know about this sub's existence and only be looking at parenting subs). But, clearly - that was not my path - nor any of yours.  Next, I'm also so glad to be here in this community.  I have been reading this sub since my loss, and it has really been a comfort to know that I am not alone.  

My story is not that unique.  If you are so inclined you can read about it on r/parenting.  Essentially, I received terrible news at my 20 week anatomy scan.  On top of some random other problems (bladder size/lack of anus), my daughter had  open spina bifida. It wasn't in the worst spot on the spine (in fact it was fairly low down), but her brain had already begun swelling with hydrocephalus and malformations.  But the fact that her lesion was low on the spine kept my husband and I so confused about what the diagnosis meant - we felt such incredible hope.    We had decided we wanted to look into fetal surgery to save our daughter.  We spoke with the Children's Hospital of Philly (which has some of the best surgeons in the country for this area) about whether we were candidates.  Unfortunately, we were not.  

When I spoke about my daughter's prognosis with my doctors without the surgery - they refused to give a straight answer.  But basically, the worst case scenario was a severely brain damaged girl requiring brain surgeries throughout her life, who may or may not walk, and will definitely need surgery upon birth to fix the spina bifida, and probably create an anus or bladder.  On the other hand - they didn't want to say that she wouldn't have been mostly OK!  It was so confusing.  I wanted to hope, but finally a doctor got real with me and said the chance that she was going to be OK was minuscule and likely she wasn't going to be OK.

To those ladies that have had a ""gray"" diagnosis.  Ugh.  I'm so sorry.  It was so tough.  I cried almost all day everyday.  It was so hard to decide to terminate her since maybe...MAYBE...there was a chance.  Shouldn't we have taken that chance - for her??  It felt selfish to terminate - I mean - it was.  But we decided to.  Maybe this is an excuse, but I also kept thinking of the life my toddler would have if we kept our baby.  If we ended up having a severely special needs child, my toddler's life would be forever altered.  I didn't want that for her.

So we terminated.  Approximately 2 weeks after the initial scan showed abnormalities we had our TFMR.  It was uneventful.  I had the laminaria sticks and then the next day went in for a D&E.  I was completely under for the whole procedure.  I had some cramping that day and the next - but the cramps were not even as bad as my period.  I bled for approximately one week, and then spotted for a little over another week.  Now I am in the waiting game for my first period to return.  I hope that happens soon.  My procedure was over a month ago. 

I've been taking the high dose folic acid since the procedure and I'm super anxious to get started on TTC.  I know plenty of women on here discuss being afraid to.  I'm having the opposite reaction.  I'm afraid not to get pregnant again.  I'm desperate to have it happen.  With my first daughter we had difficulty getting pregnant and I'm afraid that will be what I go through again.  So, I just want this waiting to be over and to be pregnant again - and eventually, the mother of 2 that I thought I would be this February.  

But here I am.  I hug my daughter every day and am thankful that I have her through this whole mess.  And what a mess.  But, I'm ready to move on despite the sadness and confusion.
