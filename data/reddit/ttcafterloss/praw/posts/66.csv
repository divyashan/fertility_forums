I was overwhelmed by your stories and experiences, and it meant so much to me to feel less alone.

We received our amnio results on Monday which confirmed the T-18 diagnosis and also found out we were having a little girl. We were booked into the hospital for Thursday to fulfill a legal waiting period. We spent the next few days preparing - our parents arrived, we chose a name for her, I knitted a wee blanket. 

In the Netherlands, where we live, there is no other option at this stage (20 weeks) than to deliver. While I was quite devastated by the idea at first, now that it’s over I am so grateful for the experience.

I was given Mifepristone to take on Tuesday evening. I arrived at the hospital 9:30 on Thursday where they started inserting the Misoprostil tablets, every two hours. I was offered morphine injections or an epidural. They don’t do walking epidurals here so I chose the morphine - it made me a bit woozy and took the edge off the pain but I could still feel everything. Around 9 hours later, the pain became very intense and the contractions were relentless. Before they could give me morphine, I delivered our daughter with 3 pushes. I had my partner on one side and my mom on the other and I am so grateful they were both there. She wasn’t born breathing.

As I had been scared about seeing her, everyone assured me right away that she looked perfect, just very small - she was under a pound. My partner cut the cord and they put her in my arms and I immediately just loved her. We ended up spending about 6 hours with her before we said goodbye. She was surrounded by love.

My placenta wouldn’t come out so they had to do a small operation to remove everything. I was back home by 2am, a little sore (now very sore, 2 days later) and absolutely heartbroken. I had no idea I would feel this overwhelmingly sad and empty. At the same time, I am thankful for the experience - for something so terrible, it went as well as it could have, and we had amazing, empathetic doctors and midwives guide us through. 

We’ve been told we only need to wait one cycle to try again; we will see if we are emotionally ready though. If anyone wants to talk about their experience, or having to deliver, please reach out to me - I don’t have a ‘real life’ support group so this is helping tremendously and talking about it feels healthy.

I’d also be very interested in talking to someone who has also had a trisomy 18 pregnancy, and anyone who has subsequently had a successful pregnancy - we are waiting for our full karyotype results and while the doctors have assured us this was most likely a fluke, I still worry.

I had a period 4 weeks and 5 days after and then another 2 weeks after that on the 2nd October. My breasts had stopped leaking and producing milk then.

Then we get to yesterday, and I passed breast milk again for the first time in a month. Hubby says that they feel bigger again and he's becoming super hopeful but I have to shut him down as I don't want to get my hopes up incase.

My bleeding/spotting finally stopped after lingering for two weeks, just in time for my body to show signs it's gearing up to ovulate.

So yesterday we dtd for the first time since our loss.  I'm not into it but I want a baby so there's that. And today was the day I was told to take a pregnancy test and let them know if it was positive or negative. 

It's positive. Which hurts so much because here I am starting to ttc again while I'm still seeing two lines from my baby I lost. 

I guess I'm worried and I wish I had waited until my hcg levels were negative.

I delivered at 21w on September 15. Bleeding started then and never stopped. I was passing huge clots and my uterus was not shrinking. My hcg was 6 four weeks after delivery. Last Wednesday, October 17, I had a d&c. My bleeding until yesterday was very light, pink, and only when I wiped. Yesterday (Monday October 22) my activity increased as I went to work. After the d&c (I have worked about 2 weeks before the procedure). Today my bleeding has continued to be heavier and really dark, fresh colored. 

Is it possible I started my period? Is it possible to start your period without lochia (or torture bleeding I have experienced) stopping? Alternatively, is this just post D&C bleeding? Is it okay for it to increase? I talked to my doctor’s nurse yesterday. They were not concerned - still within normal time for d&c/increase in activity. 

Other information: I started temping just to get in the habit again. My temp has dropped and when I compare this chart to others the trends are similar... 😭🤷‍♀️

For those who haven’t seen my last post a few days ago. I started to seriously contemplate therapy to help me grieve. Lately I’ve been feeling as if i have no one to talk to. My husband has become Superman and does everything he can to keep me smiling. So i don’t want to vent to him because he’s doing an amazing job trying to help me. And i don’t want him to feel like he’s not. And My friends have there own problem. My family is all stateside (I’m in the USAF stationed in Japan). So I’m trapped in my own thoughts 

Yesterday was a weird day for me.. part of the day i felt almost myself again but other parts i felt like a dark cloud was hovering over me. I went to the gym after work like i used too. My husband and i had a good night with jokes and laughs. But then it was time for me to go to sleep... which i haven’t been doing much of.. my mind was very heavy and the black cloud was right over me. 

I was doing good at keeping my thoughts calm and look towards the future. But something took over. I felt as if i couldn’t move, my hands and feet felt sweaty.. than i started feeling light headed.. my heart was racing and i felt like i was going to pass out. I knew immediately i was having a panic attack.. I’ve never had one before. But I’ve been experiencing anxiety lately and it felt like i was having an anxiety attack on steroids.. 

As soon as it started i told my husband. And he laid with me holding me tight. Telling me everything is okay and trying to help calm me. But it wasn’t working. So we went to the ER... it was confirmed i had a panic attack and i was proscribed Ambien to help me sleep.. i was also gave a consult to follow up with mental health

6 weeks since i lost My girl at 22w and i thought i was doing good. Until i went back to work last week and the black cloud came..

I found out I had a mmc on 10/8 and took misoprotosol the next day.  No follow up ultrasound or anything, I should have been almost 12 weeks but my baby measured 8 and their heart had stopped.

I'm not handling it well. Or maybe I am, I don't know. I had a full blown panic attack yesterday for the first time in 8 years.  And in addition to being devastated I also feel traumatized by the actual experience of passing my baby.  That's where all of this lies. 

Going back in time I would make the same choice again for personal reasons and trauma aside.  I wanted to bury my baby. But even so, I was not prepared on any level for what it was actually like. So now, in addition to heartbreak and grief there's this trauma monster to deal with.  

Being sad and traumatized just isn't enough. I also feel desperate to be pregnant again. It's so confusing. I know my baby is lost and irreplaceable and I love him with all my heart and nothing will ever change that but I still have a dream to have another child. And it's a desperate dream. And I really do feel desperate. I see no reason to wait any longer than the point at which my body decides to ovulate.  So tick tock. 

And now we are finally getting to the title issue.  I don't feel attractive anymore. Logically I know I look exactly the same. Except for that hollow look in my reflection.  But I don't feel attractive at my core, at where ever the very essence of what it is to be a woman is.  And I mean that for me, not all women. 

My husband does (find me attractive) and I was shocked. Like, I just don't understand how. How am I supposed to have sex and feel attractive from the same part of my body that lost my baby?  My body that failed me. My baby. I can't stop feeling the feelings. And not just the emotional ones even though those are bad enough.  The very sensation. It guts me.

So I didn’t get pregnant this cycle, even with amazing timing. I know the chance is between 20-30% per cycle, but since it’s only my second cycle post loss, I’m wondering if my lining didn’t get built up enough. I never got EWCM this cycle like I normally do, so I’m wondering if I didn’t have enough estrogen before I ovulated, thus making my lining insufficient. Plus my temps didn’t go up as much as they did before, so I’m wondering if I didn’t have enough progesterone either. And my luteal phase only lasted 8 days, so that’s also concerning.

I’m spotting today I think, I think cycle 2 will start tomorrow. Spotting is mostly red but also  brown at times. I can’t tell how much is in my underwear because it’s black, but there’s plenty when I wipe. The trouble is I don’t know what my periods are like since I’ve had my copper IUD out. I had really heavy periods with bad cramping when I had it in. I got pregnant the same cycle after I got it out. My doctor didn’t do an ultrasound at my follow up, just a pelvic exam, so I’m wondering if I should request an ultrasound to see if things look okay in there.

I’m trying to be kind to myself and think it’s probably just that my body wasn’t quite ready, but I’m still so bummed. It makes me nervous about my future TTC endeavors. I just wanna know it’s gonna happen for me, though I know no one can guarantee that. I guess this is what i get for being a cycle 1 unicorn last time.

I have not been active on this sub recently (husband and I took the summer off to regroup and pay off medical bills after a miscarriage and ectopic five months apart). As we prepare to restart fertility treatments, I have been thinking a lot about how frequently I read stories about how our grief and trauma is exacerbated by insensitive and thoughtless comments and actions on the part of staff in our doctors’ office. 

To  be clear: I am incredibly grateful for the medical care that saved my life this year. But, I still think there is opportunity for medical practices to be more thoughtful and considerate in their care of women who are experiencing or have experienced infertility, pregnancy and child loss. 

I wanted to put out a call to this group to ask for your suggestions for specific, small changes medical practices could do to improve your experience as a patient. My plan is to collect ideas and make an easy-to-read one-pager to share with Ob/Gyn offices in my area. I have no idea if it will make a difference, but I truly believe those who work in this field genuinely care about their patients’ experiences and would be open to these ideas. 

Here are a few I am planning to include. I'd love your feedback and additional ideas! Thank you.  

* Offer patients who are experiencing loss or recently experienced loss a private, or at least separate, waiting area so they do not need to sit with pregnant women while they are in the process of losing their own pregnancy. 
* Consider a coding system on charts or medical records to make it obvious at first glance that a woman has a history of miscarriage or loss. That way, each person who touches that record and interacts with the patient can be thoughtful in their interactions without having to read the whole patient history.
* If a coding system is not possible, at least inform the front-desk staff before the patient checks out if a miscarriage is determined during her appointment. That way we can avoid the “we’ll need you to come back for your x week appointment on this date” conversation. 
* That said, nurses should read the patient history! I have spoken several times with the same nurse at my RE’s office and every.single.time. she’s asked me when I gave birth and I've had to remind her of my losses. 
* Have a protocol in place to cancel any future prenatal appointments after a woman loses her pregnancy so she won’t receive reminder emails and calls for an appointment she no longer needs.

I don’t know who would dare to say that to a grieving woman, and especially when it’s your daughter. I have not been able to sleep normally for over a month, I am like a robot, just trying to function and every day is hard., being awake is hard. Mom lives with us.  I want a different family and I’m thinking of moving out if and when get pregnant again. Getting a place like Airbnb or something for the first trimester. </p>

&#x200B;

I've posted here before about my experience with pregnancy loss. I found out I had a complete molar pregnancy when I was 12ish weeks along (uterus was larger than that though). I had an emergency D&C the night we found out in the ER. Everything post- D&C seemed to go well; bleeding was not terribly heavy, lasted about a week, pregnancy tests got darker (had become almost negative right before my diagnosis due to the Hook Effect). Now I have yet to have a follow up with the doctor who did my surgery, and I'm having some concerns that I'm going to need a second D&C. 

&#x200B;

I'm almost 3 weeks post-D&C now and I'm having the same weird light brown bleeding that I'd had before the procedure and the same lightning/stabbing pain in my cervix, and some cramping. I'm really concerned that I'll need a second D&C and chemo if the second one doesn't solve the issue.

Okay, now for my questions:

1. Has anyone here had more than 1 D&C for one loss? 
2. How much more likely does a second d&c make me for complications like Ashermanns?
3. How many D&Cs will typically be performed before moving on to... alternate treatments?",t2_25igmiag,False,,0,False,Multiple D&C and Risks?,[],r/ttcafterloss,False,0,,0,,,False,t3_9pjm06,False,dark,1.0,,public,2,0,{},,ce4ab51a-711f-11e4-826c-12313d148545,False,[],,False,False,,{},,False,2,,False,self,False,,[],{},,True,,1539983042.0,text,0,,,text,self.ttcafterloss,True,"<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=""md""><p>Hi all,</p>

83,2048,confidence,<praw.reddit.Reddit object at 0x7f12a630cd90>,,ttcafterloss,"While I’ve actively lurked on Reddit for years, this is the first time I’ve made an account, as I feel I need to be part of a community that will understand what I’m going through. I hope that this sub is the right place to post this; if not please let me know and I’ll move it. This may get a little long but please bear with me - I’ve found a lot of comfort in other people’s stories throughout this journey and I’d like mine to be out there now in case there are others going through a similar situation.

First, I want to mention that I am 33, and we live in a country that neither of us are from, so we don’t have any close support network nearby.

I am a FTM, found out we were pregnant on 1 July. My first, but my boyfriend’s third, so we were really excited to add to our family. I had an uneasy feeling from the beginning, and was very sick all the time. But we saw the heartbeat on a scan at 6 weeks (at which point we found out we were 5 days behind what we had thought). Fast forward to 12 weeks, I had another scan where they said the baby looked perfect...but I still felt uneasy about sharing our news and was still recovering from weeks of constant throwing up and strong food aversions. And again, the baby measured 4 days behind. They told me not to worry. 

We opted to get the NIPT test. We figured it would bring peace of mind. Where we live, they only started offering NIPT testing last year so you need to agree to be part of a study, and the accuracy rates are not as high as those in the US.

Fast forward to 13 weeks and we got the call that changed everything. A midwife opened the call with “I have bad news” and told us the test had come back positive for Trisomy 18, and that she was so sorry. No info about numbers or percentages, just positive. She told us we had an appointment at the hospital the next day. Cue an endless 24 hours of disbelief, tears, googling. For those who aren’t familiar, T-18 is a near-fatal condition, 95% don’t even make it until birth. 

Devastated, we get to the hospital the next day, where the doctor explains to us that actually, this NIPT isn’t very accurate for T-18 and out of all the positives that come back, only 26% are TRUE positives. We begin to feel a little bit of hope, and the next step is a high level ultrasound. They immediately do the detailed scan, looking at the heart, brain, hands, feet, checking for every sign that T-18 presents and they can’t find anything -again, it’s “perfect”. Based on this they don’t recommend CVS or amnio, as I am assured that T-18 presents so many defects that they will turn up on ultrasound. So next step is to monitor. We are so relieved.

I go home and think about it and we do decide we want to do the amnio, to be sure. So they book us in at 16 weeks, which is the earliest they will do it here. So, at 16 weeks we arrive and they do another high level scan first. They carefully check everything again - brain, heart, hands, feet, stomach, diaphragm. Again, baby is “perfect” and the doctor sees “no need” for an amnio. In fact she thinks we would be putting the baby at risk since there is nothing on the ultrasound and amnios are risky. Having become well-educated in T-18 by this point, we ask tons of questions. Would she be surprised if something shows up later? Yes she would be shocked. And so on. We bring up the fact that the baby is 10 days off from what should have been the date of conception, but I had long cycles and she brushes it off. So we leave, feeling better again, and without the amnio.

Fast forward to yesterday, my 19 week anatomy scan. I’d been feeling very anxious leading up to it, but then I’d been anxious the whole pregnancy. My first trimester sickness had morphed into severe second trimester migraines that no one could explain and were really impacting my everyday life. But my belly was growing quickly - this reassured me as T-18 babies are supposed to be growth restricted.
We’d finally shared our news with work, with friends, with extended family.

We get to the hospital and the doctor is cheery, saying he looks forward to confirming everything is good with the baby. But as they do the scan, they are quieter than usual - instead of them assuring us everything looks good as they move from part to part, they are talking quietly to each other in a language we don’t understand. Spending lots of time on the brain, on the heart, on the hands. The doctor leaves and arrives back with another doctor for a second opinion. It’s then explained to us that our “perfect” baby now has cysts on the brain, a hole in the heart, and a clenched fist - nothing unfixable on its own, but together, along with my positive NIPT, a very strong indication of T-18.  And just like that, everything crashed down. My boyfriend, clutching my hand. Says he feels like he’s going to be sick. They performed an amnio, then and there. We were told to expect the worst and start preparing - they knew we’d agreed to terminate if it turned out to be T-18, as there is such a small chance of life, let alone any quality of life. I’d found every single story online about false positives, and now it suddenly turned out that mine was actually just positive. 

Now we are home, waiting for the inevitable phone call. I’m going through such a range of emotions - I’m so sad, I’m grieving what I’ve gone through and what I won’t have. I’m angry, I’m so angry they didn’t give me the testing earlier when I asked for it, I’m angry they gave us so much hope, I’m angry it’s come to nearly 20 weeks now. I’m scared - I’m really scared of what next week will bring. I have to deliver the baby, that is the only option here. I’m scared that my first delivery is going to be a baby that is not alive, and I’m scared of what this means for my future. My boyfriend is also devastated, supporting me the best he can, and he’s scared about my own health. My mom is flying out, thank god - I don’t think I could face this without her. 

Again, if you made it through to the end, sorry for the length but I condensed it the best I could. I’m hoping there are others out there whom I can talk to - I really need to hear from those who have been in similar situations as I know how helpful that can be.

I used to be in the May2019bump group, expecting our first baby on May 22, 2019. Unfortunately, we were told we had a missed miscarriage and that group was supportive when I mentioned it, but I think I should come and be part of this group now. After we had grieved our loss, I still felt something wasn't right as my levels kept going up. Luckily I pushed for more testing and this past Tuesday we found out I had an ectopic pregnancy. To terminate the pregnancy I opted for the methotrexate injections. I thought I was over it because we (my husband and I) already grieved, but this is a whole new feelings.

&#x200B;

I'm so so angry with the world. This was our first baby and the chance of having an ectopic pregnancy is 1%. Who gets the thing that's one per cent chance? How is that fair? I feel like I've done literally everything ""right"" in life, yet we still get the worst luck and have to deal with this tragic loss. I'm 31 so I'm feeling stressed about my age already as I don't want to have kids too late in life (my personal preference). Now with the methotrexate treatment, it could take minimum 6-8 weeks for my levels to go down, and they recommend waiting at least 3 months AFTER your first regular period before yous tart trying again, to ensure you have enough folic acid in your system again. This pains me, because although we got pregnant after 2 months of trying the first time, it is definitely not guaranteed to happen that quickly. So in reality, we are looking at 6-8 months before we can get pregnant again, IF everything goes as ""normal"". I am just so angry. So angry at the universe. Why do deadbeat parents get to have healthy pregnancies and babies, but here I am struggling the first time around? And now my chances of healthy pregnancy are even lower since the first ectopic. And my fallopian tube may be scarred now. What the hell did I do in a past life to deserve this?

&#x200B;

I do so much good in this life. I did everything right in ""society terms"". I'm a vegetarian, I eat healthy, I workout, my husband and I have a healthy and happy marriage, I volunteer, I have a steady job and income, I'm kind to others all the time, I help people as often as I can, I'm supportive to friends and family, I even save fucking bugs whenever I can. I move snails and worms off the sidewalks so they don't get stepped on. Seriously. Not because I want good karma or something, but because I actually care so much. But the universe still chooses to punish me with giving us an unviable, really rare type of pregnancy. WHY. It's not fair. I'm so angry at the universe right now and this is so unlike me and I don't know how to handle it. Has anyone felt this way? What have you done to help yourself? I'm really struggling. My husband is as supportive as he can be but I'm still not dealing with this well.

&#x200B;

Thanks for listening to my rant.

Today would have been your first birthday

I will always wonder how life would have been

Sometimes I go into what would have been your room

Open the top drawer of your dresser 

And pull out a newborn onesie

It still smells sweet, like the baby detergent I so eagerly washed it in 

When I found out you were coming

Today would have been your first birthday

I walk by the little outfits in stores and my heart aches

Thinking of how I would have dressed you in your first real costume

My little pumpkin

I imagine how I would have planned your first party

Mums, gourds, cute spooky things

The smash cake

You would have been your daddy's favorite birthday gift

Every year

Today would have been your first birthday

Sometimes I touch my belly

And remember what it felt like 

To wish for it to grow bigger for once 

To be in awe that this body once held another

If only for a short while

I think of you when I wake up and when I fall asleep

Wondering who you would have been

Would you be walking? 

Would I have already heard your tiny voice call me ""mama"" for the first time? 

Would I see more of myself or your daddy in you?

98,2048,confidence,<praw.reddit.Reddit object at 0x7f12a630cd90>,,ttcafterloss,"Hello, I just joined this sub and wanted to give a quick intro.

I have had four losses in the past 9 months (my first due date was October 2) - all early, 3 at 5 weeks, 1 at 6 weeks.  I've had the recurrent loss testing done and everything is normal.  My diagnosis is unexplained recurrent pregnancy loss.  I should note that I have a 3 year old, who was conceived with no issues.  

My first RE recommended we go straight to IVF with PGS.  I went for a second opinion to another RE and she said she didn't know if she would recommend that course, because since all of my testing is normal, even with PGS testing, the same thing could happen again.  We are waiting for results from my husband's karyotype.  She also said she wants look at my uterine lining next cycle, a week after ovulation.  However, if there is an issue with my lining, it's hard to deal with unless you do IVF.  

Overall, I like this RE better than my first but I came away feeling pretty discouraged.  It seemed like she wasn't confident that I would ever have another term pregnancy, even if we did IVF (which honestly I'd like to avoid).  Maybe that's how she has to act, but damn, it sucked.  My first RE gave me a handout (lol) on recurrent loss which said that the likelihood of a healthy pregnancy was still high even if you had previous losses (especially when there is no explanation for the losses, like here).  My previous thought process had been that I would eventually get the healthy pregnancy, it just might take a few more losses, but now I've started to think more about the fact that we might not have another.

I took this month off from trying.  I have been working with an acupuncturist since last spring (after my first loss but before my others).  She says that I have a liver and spleen deficiency and that my body is depleted from stress.  I've been seeing her pretty consistently and took some herbs that she prescribed this past month.  No idea if that will do anything, but I guess we will see.

I know that the Reddits I am subscribed to were blowing up yesterday, and I didn’t really get to read much. So here is what I wrote right before going to bed. 

Today is something that I wish I didn't know about. Today is National Pregnancy and Infant Loss Remembrance Day. I have not have one, but two miscarriages in the last year. I just passed what should have been the due date of my first pregnancy. I didn't even look to see the due date of the second because it was a chemical pregnancy that I technically shouldn't have even noticed. September 30th was my due date. It was hard, but it was okay. I accepted it, I acknowledged it and I did everything I could to get through it. I am the only person (besides Brian of course) in my life who will ever put significance on that day, which is okay. 

I am not the only person I know who has had a miscarriage. Miscarriage or pregnancy loss is not uncommon, it happens A LOT... 1 in 4 women have one. I have researched so much it hurts. Why me? What did I do.. or didn't do? There is no answer. My doctor pulled Brian and I in to her office and the first thing she asked was, ""Are you okay?"" looking at me directly. I wanted to say, ""No... I lost my Mom and I lost two babies.. who in their right mind would be OK?"" but I said, ""I think so... I mean I function...."" She was really seeing if I had  depression. I wouldn't put myself in that category though. We did all the RPL (repeat pregnancy loss) testing we could. Thankfully my doctor took a missed miscarriage and a chemical pregnancy all within 6 months of each other as abnormal. She warned us that there was an 80%-90% of the tests coming out normal. Most doctors wouldn't even acknowledge you until you have had 3 (or more) losses; which lets be honest... thats crap! After all the testing of course Brian and I are perfectly healthy. Nothing is wrong. So we are still left with the why. Which they always say your baby most likely had genetic abnormalities.

This is just a small part of my story. I am not special. I am just speaking up. Out of the 30 years on earth I only knew one couple who had experienced pregnancy loss. So for me... I was alone. Miscarriage comes in many different forms and happens every single day. I have found communities online that have helped me learn so much more about miscarriage, the emotions that come with it and encourage to keep trying. Just remember the next time you want to ask someone who they are having kids or if they started trying yet, that its not the best thing to ask. You never know where someone is on their journey.

After the nurse asked a few basic questions, she was messing around with something on the counter, and I asked if it was a pregnancy test. She said, ""Well yeah, we don't have any record of you being pregnant since you just took a test at home, and it's negative so you're not pregnant."" I burst into tears. She immediately asked me about my exercise habits(???) and I had a really hard time responding. After a few more unrelated questions, she handed me a box of tissues and said ""here"" and then left.

The doctor, once she came in, was extremely nice and comforting and helped me process it. But I wish I had heard the news a little more gently.

Also, I'm feeling weird about the whole chemical pregnancy thing. The doctor didn't even call it that, she just said ""possible very early loss,"" but ""chemical pregnancy"" is what my research has turned up. All the sources say that physically, it's more like a cycle in which pregnancy didn't occur, and not like a """"true miscarriage."""" I am certain it hurts way worse if it happens later, but it still hurts now and feels like a terrible loss. I loved that baby already and I can't believe it's gone.

We also did a blood test, and my hcg level was 3, so I asked the doctor if I was actually pregnant at all - can it really drop that fast? She said it could have been a very early loss OR a false positive. So now I'm not sure what to do. Do I still get to grieve even though maybe no baby was lost? I feel so sad and confused.

Added to that, my husband isn't sure he wants to keep trying. I really do but don't want to pressure him.

Those are the times when it felt like my dreams ended. Time stood still. 
5 times I danced to that positive test. 5 times I dreamed of the life that could be. 5 times I learned I was not going to be the mom I wanted to be. 
Those losses changed me, shaped me to who I am. I know I am more bitter than I was. I know I do not think about pregnancy and babies the way I used to. It caused tension between friends when they couldn’t understand why I didn’t just “get over it”. 

How does one describe the daily anxiety, the nauseous feeling that sits right between my breasts, the weight that seems to creep up my throat in a strangling hold? How does one describe the depression that sits at the pit of your stomach, that comes up every time you think of pregnancy, miscarriage, or family. Anything can remind you of these things, remind you of your pregnancies and losses. 
One miscarriage makes you feel horrible, lost, confused, alone. By the fourth you're just numb. Oh sure you're still excited every time you see that positive test, can't help but dream of the life you will have... But it becomes just another number. 5th pregnancy, 6th week, 4th miscarriage, cycle 5, no period for 6 weeks. All just numbers. 
And the idea that, after adding up all the pregnancies and how far along each was... the idea that had it been one pregnancy... I could have known if it was a boy or a girl. Had it been one pregnancy, my baby would be x days/weeks/months/years old. 
But how do you describe these feelings? How do you explain to someone who has never been through it, what it feels like when you see your friends or family, pregnant or with a new baby. That every time someone asks ""when are you going to try?"", as if you weren't trying already! That every time someone asks, it tears your heart a little but more. You see women happily pregnant, or worse, not wanting to be pregnant, and you die a little more inside because you so badly want that to be you.
How can all that be explained? The grief never leaves. It's a weight you carry with you, always. People will say, just don't think about that... don't remember that on this day, a year, or two ago, I lost my 1st, 2nd, 3rd baby... How can I forget?! Those were the days my world crashed around me... the days a portion of my dreams died. I want so much to be blind to the dates, oblivious to the amount of time that has passed that I have gone without that wonderful baby in my tummy, my arms... my life. 
I go on living with this pain. I was told I have a bad attitude...i was called negative. But this is who I am. Every loss has turned me into the person I am today. I am not afraid to speak of my losses, but I don't say how much each loss hurt.

And then it happened again. September 2017, that second line appeared. I knew the drill: start progesterone and baby aspirine, blood work every two days, early ultrasound to see if maybe, maybe!!, this one would stick. Second bloodwork came back and it didn’t double.  I had an anxiety filled week waiting to miscarry until I had my ultrasound. And that’s when my doctor and I found my double rainbow, my twins. 
I had a very easy pregnancy physically, or as easy as any twin pregnancy can be. But let me tell you it was the hardest nine months of my life. 
I asked my doctor, “at what point do I come to the hospital if I’m bleeding? When can you save them?” Because I knew there was nothing to be done if I lost them before a certain point. And even once I hit the “age of viability” my anxiety didn’t decrease. Between my monthly ultrasounds I was a wreck. I tried to schedule my GP appointments between my ultrasounds so I could hear their heartbeats on the Doppler. But even then, every twinge or pang sent my running to the bathroom convinced this was it. I was going to lose them. 


I am not here to tell you that because I found my rainbow you’ll find yours. I am here to say that you are not alone in your storm. One question I’ve heard a lot is: how do you enjoy a pregnancy after miscarriage? My answer: celebrate. Celebrate that plus sign, celebrate the nausea and morning sickness and all the other wonderfully horrible symptoms that come along with pregnancy. Celebrate it as long as it lasts. Because if you don’t, and you make it to the finish line without celebrating everything before, are you going to be disappointed? I know I would have been. 
When it came time to finally have my twins via c section, I asked my doctor to tie my tubes. People questioned me, but my doctor didn’t. Because I knew, when the number didn’t double at the beginning, I knew then that I couldn’t do it. 6 pregnancies was enough for me. I didn’t need any more numbers. 

So carry your babies with you in your hearts. And next time you’re pregnant, if there is a next time for you, celebrate it, and celebrate your angels that came before.

I’m having a really rough go with this miscarriage and I have some questions. I had a missed miscarriage discovered September 4, was supposed to be 8 weeks but baby was measuring 6+4 or 5, no heartbeat. Had an emotionally traumatic d&c September 8. My hcg has been slow to taper off, was 448 almost 4 weeks after the procedure and down to 30 this past week. In follow up ultrasounds I was diagnosed with something called enhanced myometrial vascularity, also called AVM— basically a tangle of veins and arteries that shouldn’t be there and could be very dangerous if they rupture; I could hemorrhage. They also saw a small piece of what they guess is retained placenta. Jackpot! Then when I returned for an additional follow up last week, they “think” the avm is getting better, but the small piece of placenta is still there. 

So now I have a few questions:

1. Has anyone had experience with retained placenta 5 weeks after d&c? They want me to follow up in a week or two but truthfully I find that place so deeply upsetting (every time I go in they ask when I delivered, waiting room filled with happy pregnant ladies and their partners) and I don’t want to go back. 

2. I just started spotting/pinkish brown bleeding but not very much at all, some stringy clots (GROSS! Never thought I’d speak so candidly about the stuff that comes out of my body but here we are.) — how can you tell if this is a period or not? 

3. Is it possible or has it happened to any of you where there’s retained placenta but hcg is zero?

I agreed to a d&c for this week but it hasn't been scheduled yet. I was an emotional wreck when I found out and didn't ask any questions. I wont see the doctor until the procedure so id like to ask a few questions about your experiences that I didn't really see covered in another thread. 

First of all, I'm currently taking hormones, progesterone and estrodiol. I was told I could stop taking them Monday and nothing else was mentioned. Im assuming medically that wont cause any problems but what about emotionally? I'm quite sensitive to hormones and I'm recovering from anxiety that's always been worse when pmsing. Does suddenly quiting hormones or even just after a MC cause crazy hormones and emotions? I just want to be prepared.

I've had small surgeries before so I'm not worried about that, besides the emotional toll, but what about recovery. Ill be trying to conceive again as soon as possible because of DOR. Ive read that a lot of people were mobile pretty quickly after, but took a few days off. My doc said I should be physically fine to go to work the next day, emotionally however not so much. I will have to go to work the next day though as I've already had too much time off (was on bed rest for the past two weeks bc of a subchorionic hematoma before my loss).

Once before. I was so excited that I had gotten pregnant the first time we tried. We had started trying one month before we really wanted to conceive cause I always read you don’t get pregnant your first time trying. So I thought it would be a nice trial and if we did get pregnant than it would be okay. 

After having brown discharge at about 6 weeks and a missed diagnosis and two ERs later I had a d and c to remove my possible molar pregnancy. A week later we found out it was a complete molar pregnancy. 

So weekly monitoring to make sure my hCG went down to zero. My hcg went up one week and stayed stagnant the other week and they set an appointment with an oncologist. 

Luckily my hcg has been under 5 two weeks in a row and I have moved to monthly testing. 

So much anxiety. If my levels stay negative I will be cleared to ttc in February. 

I have no children. There is an increased risk for having another molar pregnancy. While they say it doesn’t change your chances for a miscarriage, a lot of women who had a mole have a miscarriage next.

If you are not familiar with our story, you may look back at my posts/comments, but I wanted to keep those that have reached out updated. 

The report indicates that she had Turner’s Syndrome. “All 20 cells examined show a loss of chromosome x, consistent with monosomy x.”

Our NIPT did not indicate an elevated risk for chromosomal abnormalities. I know this is a risk analysis, but it was so far off of our radar. I don’t regret not opting for additional testing at that time. From a quick google search, I found that Turner’s and HLHS occur together 20% of the time. I’m still in awe at how strong our little girl was for hanging on for 21 weeks. She worked and fought way too hard. 

Also an update on me. I don’t actually have retained placenta. My uterus was/is not contracting to normal size. It was still measuring 14 weeks last week. Tomorrow I go back to my doctor to see if there is any change. He said that my uterus is just building a thick lining and shedding it over and over. I’ve been cramping and drinking red raspberry leaf tea, so I’m hoping my body is getting it under control. I went back to the ER Thursday because I was bleeding a lot again. My hcg was 6.0. The week before it was 9.2. Hopefully that’s another indicator my body is getting less confused. Im not bleeding much at all now (clear mucus with some pink when I wipe), but that has been my pattern. I am not moving through all the phases of Lochia.

It was an unplanned pregnancy but I wanted every second of it from the moment I found out.

It has been a long road to recovery. At first I thought I would never try again, for fear of going through that trauma again. Women have it so tough when it comes to childbearing. And when you have experienced a loss it changes everything...it's this crazy amount of fear, but simultaneous intensified desire to have children. At least that's how I experienced it.

Anyways, last month I decided I was ready to try. We had sex exactly when I thought we should, a few times (on different days) to be sure.

&#x200B;

As some of you know, I'm in my last year of medical school. Since my own TFMR earlier this year, I've been growing increasingly frustrated that my medical education has essentially ignored pregnancy terminat!on. To me, this is inexcusable: regardless of doctors' personal beliefs, they should be familiar with a medical procedure/life experience that \*many\* of their patients will have experienced. When a few of us raised this issue with the administration, they asked us a very good question: **what do you think every graduating medical student should know about abort!on?** So, I decided to take this question to all of you.

&#x200B;

**If you've ended a pregnancy--regardless of the reason--what do you wish your doctors knew about your experience?**

&#x200B;

Thanks so much for sharing. I hope we can use your input to help train doctors to be better prepared to care for their many patients who will have terminated a pregnancy.

&#x200B;

**Update:**

Thank you, everyone, for sharing your experiences. These are powerful examples of why we should be talking about pregnancy loss--particularly terminat!on--more openly, not only in medicine, but also in society in general. So many of your experiences resonated with me: feeling wholly unprepared for the physical pain I experienced, not expecting my milk to come in and having to stuff toilet paper in my bra at work, hearing another baby's heartbeat on Doppler through the exam room wall as I waited for my doctor to do my post-D&E exam. But I am equally humbled by how many experiences I was fortunate to avoid: my doctor's office has always been aware of my loss (no one ever made the mistake of assuming I was still pregnant) and automatically canceled my remaining appointments, I never felt like my providers were judging or discouraging my decision to term!nate, I was never given false hope, and my partner and I felt like our doctors left us with a solid plan going forward. Healthcare providers can never know the full extend of their patients' experiences, but we should do our damn best.

At the end of July, I found out I was pregnant with my surprise ""keto"" baby. This was my first natural pregnancy. My other two boys are from IVF and IUI. I was scared, surprised and excited. My husband was beyond angry with himself and acted like the whole world was going to end. 

A week later, I had an early miscarriage. My first miscarriage. I know that some don't ""count"" it as a legit miscarriage because there wasn't ever a heartbeat, but this hurt more than all my failed IVF cycles combined. 

It still hurts. 

Lately, I have been consumed by thoughts of wanting another baby. We used to have a ""five year plan"" set to talk about having another baby in five years. Two years have gone by. I don't want to wait three more years. My chances of miscarriage go up with every additional age over advanced maternal age. My eggs will go to shit, if they aren't already shit. I don't want to wait. 

But, when I talk to him about it, he literally has a panic attack. His chest gets tight, his eyes water up, he gets angry and upset. He likes the pace of our family right now. He likes that he can stay up until 2am and game on his computer and not have to worry about a baby waking up. He doesn't want to be inconvenienced again. 

He also is afraid of legit things (because I think the above things are entirely selfish), such as me suffering from postpartum depression again, our baby having a CHD like our last kid, our pregnancy being high risk like our last pregnancy, having another high-needs baby like our toy boys, and having a baby who hates him (which, unfortunately, our youngest son legitimately ""hated"" my husband until he was almost one year old, which contributed to my PPD).

Meanwhile, I am over here feeling empty and scared that I will have to live the rest of my life with this emptiness inside of me. My clock is ticking away. My history of infertility is stacked up against me. Every day I think about this baby I might not ever have, and it sucks the joy out of almost everything. 

I don't know what I want from this. I do go to regular therapy (I suffer from MDD and PTSD in the first place), my husband and I are in counseling and have been for many years. We have an appointment next week.

I had a missed miscarriage in June (Father’s Day, sorry husband) at 9w. At my 8w appointment the baby had a heartbeat but was too small. At 9w they confirmed that there was no heartbeat and I induced the miscarriage with misoprostol. That was pretty rough, but I am glad I did it that way since it provided some closure (closure by way of harrowing experience, I guess).

In the overall scheme of things, I know that I am really lucky. I got pregnant naturally on our second try, despite being 34 (me) and 40 (husband) and overweight. There weren’t any complications from the miscarriage and my doctor told me there wasn’t anything that I could have done. There’s nothing going on with me physically (besides weight) that can impact my fertility.

But, at the end of the day, even acknowledging all the luck I’ve had, the outcome is the same: I won’t be having a baby in January and I’m starting over. We’ve been trying for two cycles now and my period is a bit chaotic: not as regular as before and 100x more painful. This has made it difficult (so far) to get pregnant again.

After the miscarriage I grieved openly and publicly because I wanted people to know what it was like and that it was a normal part of life that was nothing to be ashamed of. I also “got better” publicly too, and now I think everyone else thinks I am “over it.” 

And, for a little bit, I was. But of my two closest friends, one just announced her second pregnancy and the other gave birth two weeks ago. They both have been very sensitive and supportive, but right now it feels like a big party I didn’t get invited to (or more accurately, got invited to and then my invite was rescinded).

I had an mmc and d&c at 9 weeks two months ago. 30 days after I had a week long period and two weeks after that I ovulated. at 8 dpo I got a BFP on a first response early results test. 9 dpo I had more positives not none any darker. 10 dpo (yesterday) I had a very very faint, almost negative test. I had a beta yesterday that confirmed I’m not pregnant (hcg=1).

I learned my lesson about early testing (I early tested successfully in two previous pregnancies but won’t in future months!) but am just wondering what might have given me those BFPs?

164,2048,confidence,<praw.reddit.Reddit object at 0x7f12a630cd90>,,ttcafterloss,"Hi all. I'm having a really hard couple of weeks and it felt like time to come out of hiding. 

My DH and I have been TTC since June of 2016 with no luck at all. We tried IUI in Sept '17, my husband gets routine SA's (his numbers are fine but not great), and all my testing has been fine. IUI failed and we just kept plugging along. We planned to do another IUI in April '18. Bought all the meds, made plans, etc.

I found out I was pregnant via HPT on March 26, 2018. I will never, ever forget that feeling. I cried like a crazy person and screamed at my husband, ""Is this right? Does this look right to you?"" We both walked around in a stupor for the rest of the day. I kept taking tests every Monday for weeks after that to keep reminding myself that it was real. I was so anxious about it because it had taken so long to happen at all. 

When we went to the doctor for the first time, I should've been exactly 8 weeks. Our fetus was measuring about 2 weeks behind, but had a heartbeat. It was slow, but it was there. I honestly think this was when I lost part of myself. Not the MMC, not the pain of actually passing clots, but the knowledge that it was there. It was real, but it still wasn't going to happen for us. 

I went back in for a follow up about 5 days later. There was literally no change at all. Still measuring about 6 weeks. Slow heartbeat. Went back another 6 days later and it was gone. The stress of all the appointments had really gotten to me and, honestly, finding out there was no heartbeat felt like a relief. At least we had an answer. I opted for the misoprostal and didn't take any time off from work. I just wanted to move on.

About 3 weeks after I found out I was pregnant, my best friend also became pregnant, after about 7 months of trying. She was SO excited to do this together and started imaging our showers and our kids being friends, etc. I was too anxious for my new OB appointment and indulged her but kept saying ""we'll see"". Sometimes it feels like I knew it wasn't going to be a thing. My friend just started her third trimester.

It's been a hard year, but I still had all those fertility drugs sitting in my fridge's crisper, waiting to be used. We just did another IUI in September of this year and found out last week that it didn't fucking work. My husband's numbers were way better this time. We had a different protocol. My follicles looked great. Fucking nothing. Period was perfectly, exactly on time. Like always.

My best friend is pregnant. Two of my friends just announced that they're pregnant with #2. I just...can't do this anymore? We're on 2 lists for upcoming IVF trials that are deeply discounted and I can't even muster any excitement for any part of it. I know you all know how hard this is, but I'm so tired. I don't even know how to properly mourn the idea of a kid that we had for about a month. My therapist and I laugh about how I like to bounce around the various stages of grief depending on the day. (It's been ""bargaining"", as of late.)

I don't understand and I don't know what else to do. I bought myself a little Jizo statue and I'm working really hard to take comfort in that. I would've been due on 11/30, so my husband and I are taking a vacation for my birthday, but I have a hard time looking forward to anything. It's like any possible hope or good feeling or wish for the future has been beaten out of me. Sigh. Thank you for reading. I just wanted to get this off my chest. ",t2_gj6n4,False,,0,False,"Intro.

Need some advice here. I was pregnant for the first time this past July, went in for my 10wk US in early September and there was no heartbeat, had absolutely NO SIGNS of miscarriage and we were obviously devastated.

OB didn't give much direction and I have seen a lot of people who try after MC saying that the next one might also MC because of lining issues, etc. Or that it take a lot longer to conceive since your body's hormones just went haywire.

Also, I do not get a period or ovulate on my own and take Provera to start my period and Femara to help with ovulation, if anyone else has had a MC and had to use these meds to conceive after and can just give me an idea of how it went for you, I would really appreciate it.

I’m going crazy with this and hoping you all might have some perspective. Here’s my timeline:

8/7: 8 week ultrasound, baby measuring 6 weeks with weak heartbeat

8/13: second ultrasound, measuring 6 weeks, no heartbeat

8/15: d&c under ultrasound at 9+1

9/5sh: post op, HCG at 34 via blood test—at this point my husband got frustrated that I had the blood work when we could have been testing at home, I didn’t have a follow up blood test, so I don’t know if my hcg ever actually hit zero.

9/14: negative cheapie pregnancy test—I didn’t take an frer

9/14-9/21: period

9/30: ovulation (I used clear blue digital fertility monitor)

9/8: faint positive frer at 8 dpo, negative internet cheapie 
9/9: faint positive frer (3 of them over the day) 
9/10 (at 4 am because of course): even fainter possibly positive 

since I’m not seeing any darkening of the test line, I’m concerned that the frer is picking up leftover hcg, but could I still have enough for a faint positive test and still have a full 7 day period? 

I know the answer is to wait and test again but I’m going totally crazy thinking and reading and not knowing for sure.

ETA update: my beta came back negative for pregnancy (hcg=1) so def no lingering hcg, but also no pregnancy. now idea why I might have been getting false positives on my frers. *sigh*

And let me tell you it’s been a rough month.. 

My angel baby was born sleeping on 9/10... her name was Malia... she was so loved and cared for... in fact the day before we found out we lost her we had just picked up her crib and my husband was getting ready to put it together... 

She was due on January 11th 2019, i was 22w.. on 9/9 i noticed she wasn’t very active over the weekend... i didn’t think much of it then because we were very busy getting her crib and room cleaned out.

I’m feeling destroyed. Some of you know that I recently miscarried identical twins conceived via my fourth IVF overall but my first donor one and we went for double donor. Although our infertility and RPL is unexplained we went for double donor to give us our best shot at eliminating anything that might be causing both our infertility (we caught pregnant naturally only three times in almost 8 years of timed intercourse) and our recurrent miscarriages (all three natural pregnancies and two assisted ones ended in chemical pregnancies). 

Conceiving identicals from a single embryo transfer was a fairytale. The embryo was grade A expanded blast. 

I just yesterday got the results of testing on the twins and other POC and I was told the tests were very comprehensive. They found nothing at all wrong. The pregnancy tissue and placenta was all sound - no abnormal chorionic villi etc - and the twins were genetically fine - no chromosome abnormalities etc. The loss is completely unexplained. 

Although I haven’t been found to have proper clotting disorders, high NK cells or low hormones I was nonetheless on a protocol to ensure any such issues were accounted for. My consultant says it wasn’t me/my body and probably just the fact that they were identical twins that led to their demise. It’s a high-risk pregnancy. He said if the embryo had never split, he expects I’d be 18 weeks pregnant now.

We have one embryo left, but apparently it’s grade C - much less likely to lead to viable pregnancy. And I have to wait to Jan/Feb as I only just stopped my withdrawal bleed and need my cycles back to normal plus a very long protocol.  We have another potential egg donor, but also found out yesterday her BMI is too high so that won’t be happening anytime soon. It took 10 months from identifying our previous donor to egg collection so we’re looking at least at a year, even she even does bring her BMI down and is otherwise suitable.

My close friend recently disclosed she’s expecting her first on the day my twins were due, so I can’t see her or several other friends/family members because their kids/pregnancies trigger me. I can’t work because I’m so traumatised and basically cry and scream all day in my pyjamas. I feel my whole life is shrinking and being destroyed and that it’s only a matter of time before I drive my (wonderful) husband away too.
 
I know it doesn’t help to think this but I can’t stop thinking ‘why can’t I just have my twins?’. If there was nothing wrong with them, or with me, why did they have to die? Some identical twins are born alive so why couldn’t that have been us?  I just feel like we’ve rolled snake eyes repeatedly on what are supposedly unloaded dice. I tell myself that can’t happen forever and one day we will at least roll a 4, 5 or 6 - if there are no underlying issues then one day it MUST work out and we have an embryo that makes it the full 9 months, but knowing our last embryo only has a 1 in 4 chance of even implanting is extinguishing my hope for them, so now I’m having to think about a whole new double donor cycle and all the work - and wait - involved in that. I’m just so tired, and sad, and angry and in pain. I keep telling myself that in only another three years or so it will all be over and we’ll have had a baby somehow or moved onto adoption. 

But the thought of getting through those years and the work it’s going to take just feels like torture. But not as much torture as giving up.

Sorry for the novel but I feel like I’m dying the death of a thousand cuts and wanted to say so to people who will understand and not say trite things (by the way, I am medicated, seeing my GP fortnightly and a counsellor weekly). 

I know I have loads to be grateful for in my life but at the moment I’d gladly give everything up to be pregnant again. I’m so profoundly unhappy and afraid.

171,2048,confidence,<praw.reddit.Reddit object at 0x7f12a630cd90>,,ttcafterloss,"PLEASE NOTE: I am not in a good place. This post may have several trigger words for you if you have experienced pregnancy loss or infertility, and while I would never use them in an offhand way to cause anyone pain, I do not want someone to stumble upon them accidentally. Also, I just had a D and C procedure yesterday, so this is really just me trying to process.

Am I a bad person for NOT wanting to retire the baby names? Except I feel a biological need to retire them because anything else would feel like stripping away their identity. Right now we call our LO ""Angel"" and I try to feel right about that, but I just know that wouldn't have been their name if I had carried them over to earthside. And I feel like the baby knows that, too, and it hurts their feelings. But, at the same time, these baby names were the first things my husband and I agreed on and to part with them would feel like giving up the only hope I have left, if that makes sense. 

I was never that entitled when I was expecting, but my grief has made me very entitled. And that's something I'm confronting and trying to work through. Which leads into the next two things.

Why oh WHY do they not have separate grieving places? If about 1 in 4 pregnancies end in loss why do I have to sit with enormously pregnant women, to be called back to an office with a baby development chart on the wall, to walk down a hallway with giant posterboards filled with hundreds of baby pictures? Now that I'm in a slightly better place, I feel happy for all the healthy babies and pregnancies. But at the time, when I was walking down a hallway to get an ultrasound of a baby without a beating heart, it was a little raw. And then to get the d and c procedure, you have the long trek past the table of diaper cakes and flowers and balloons, through the room with giant baby posters, and there's a man wearing a shirt that says ""DAD OF TWO GIRLS"" who's like the troll guarding the bridge to the rest of the worst day of my life. I'm GLAD you have not one but two girls, but my husband is here holding my hand and I feel like screaming at you to take your braggy shirt off.

My parents are happy because they get to go on a cruise for a very low price. That they booked the morning after my d and c. Which starts 10 days after my d and c. I messaged my dad telling him I was happy for him and he said, God works in mysterious ways. What? God took my baby, and then gave you a cruise? I don't understand. I know I am ""handling this well"", but I am your daughter. Did it not occur to you that I may need you in the first 10 DAYS after my miscarriage began, or did you simply not care? But more than anything, why didn't life stop for you, too? Why is my loss not even a blip on your map? Why isn't this your loss, too? Like I said, I am newly entitled.  

I got the courage to thank the members of the group chat of friends who acknowledged our loss later in the day, and then the first person to post after me talked about their bowel movement. And I know this is my third entitled part in a row. But I was just miffed and shocked and wronged that life went on that fast for everyone else, when I have been stuck mentally wiping away that blood for the first time since it happened. But I'm stuck in the moments before that, too, because everything started and started to end in the same bathroom. But no, your BM is the next part of life and life has continued for you and my family and everyone and even me, and I can't make it stop even though it did for the baby.

Why does no one seem to tell you what to expect after a d and c? The nurse handed me a packet that said to come back if I had ""bright, red bleeding"" while bright, red bleeding had just moments previously spilled down my legs and puddled at my feet. In front of her. Seems like an oversight.

Does anyone else still feel like buying baby things? I picked out these stupid little Dalmatian onesies the week before I knew, and I think about them going out of season and not having them and somehow it hurts? Mostly I think about my sister-in-law having her newborn soon, and seeing him in those little onesies (entirely possible, we both love this brand) and feeling the loss all over again. I know it's stupid and even shallow to feel an attachment to onesies on top of all this, but somehow I do. 

Every time I open a browser for the rest of my life, am I going to see these heartwrenching ads? My husband turned off my cookies, but the kicker is that all these miscarriage sites and stories I click on are from babycenter or netmums or something similar. What is that? I know it's unavoidable but why? I just ordered myself a pregnancy loss book off of Amazon and my ""sponsered books"" from the same page were all scrapbooks for baby's first year.

&#x200B;

admins i hope this request is alright. let me know if you want any sort of verifications.

I comment here a lot. I do have my own business and a small blog affiliated with my business. And since it's National Pregnancy and Infant Loss Awareness month, I plan on adding a few posts about that to my blog. As probably others are as well. My business name is Still So Loved Designs. I sew and sell clothes for children and adults, as well as cloth pads. My blog is [www.stillsoloveddesigns.com](https://www.stillsoloveddesigns.com) I will not link my shop as this post is about the blog part and not anything else. My business is named in memory of my daughter, she was **still** born, but she is ""**still** so loved"".

I always have this irrational fear, that my daughter will be forgotten. I know I won't ever, but the world around me. So I wanted to make one blog entry that is solely dedicated to remember our losses, if you want to join me. 

So, if you want, I will add your babys name and birthdate to the list if you didn't give your baby a name or only have a date of your miscarriage, I can add this as well. If you want to add more info about your baby, that is alright too. If you want me to link back to your blog, I will happily do so. Even if you just want me to post the date or year and no further information, or just Baby + Initials, however much you are ok with sharing. 

&#x200B;

 I plan on uploading this post on October 15th and I will light a candle for every baby in the post (within reason, I have cats so if it's more candles than I can fit on my sideboard, I will not risk my cats getting dumb ideas and knocking them down because it's too many).

&#x200B;

I will also link to charities like Now I Lay Me Down To Sleep. If you know any other good charities and resources please let me know and i will link those too.

My blog is <a href=""https://www.stillsoloveddesigns.com"">www.stillsoloveddesigns.com</a> I will not link my shop as this post is about the blog part and not anything else. My business is named in memory of my daughter, she was <strong>still</strong> born, but she is &quot;<strong>still</strong> so loved&quot;.</p>

<p>I always have this irrational fear, that my daughter will be forgotten. I know I won&#39;t ever, but the world around me. So I wanted to make one blog entry that is solely dedicated to remember our losses, if you want to join me. </p>

<p>So, if you want, I will add your babys name and birthdate to the list if you didn&#39;t give your baby a name or only have a date of your miscarriage, I can add this as well. If you want to add more info about your baby, that is alright too. If you want me to link back to your blog, I will happily do so. Even if you just want me to post the date or year and no further information, or just Baby + Initials, however much you are ok with sharing. </p>

<p>&#x200B;</p>

<p>I plan on uploading this post on October 15th and I will light a candle for every baby in the post (within reason, I have cats so if it&#39;s more candles than I can fit on my sideboard, I will not risk my cats getting dumb ideas and knocking them down because it&#39;s too many).</p>

<p>&#x200B;</p>

<p>I will also link to charities like Now I Lay Me Down To Sleep. If you know any other good charities and resources please let me know and i will link those too. </p>

We had our first trimester genetic testing along with a NT ultrasound and everything was fine. We got out of the dreaded first trimester and finally announced to the rest of the world. I’m an ultrasound technologist and know of all the shitty things that could still happen. But I let myself just be happy, enjoy my pregnancy, and not worry about everything else that could still go wrong.  

Now we have our second trimester genetic testing and a week later we get a call from our OB. She said that our blood work came back showing that there was a 1 in 5 chance our baby had a genetic disorder. I immediately started balling and thought the worse. We schedule a level 2 ultrasound the following week at a MFM office. Prior to our ultrasound we meet with the genetic counselor and she told us about all the possible disorders and our choices. My husband and I discussed what we would want if our nightmare was reality and we knew for us, we couldn’t let our baby suffer and would let her go if we had to.

The genetic counselor tells us that our baby girl is likely to have Trisomy 18 and can confirm with ultrasound. We go in for our ultrasound and I still kept thinking THEY were all wrong and our baby was okay. I naively thought this couldn’t be happening to us and we would be the people to have a false positive. 

We’re getting our ultrasound and again I’m just blinded by my own disbelief of what’s really happening. I see the tech is having trouble getting the heart, head/brain, kidney, nose/lips, and feet/hands pictures she should be getting and I just think, wow she’s not very good at this. And that’s what I thought throughout this ultrasound. That’s what I regret the most. Not being able to tell my husband that there is something extremely wrong and brace him for what’s to come. She steps out and we wait for the MD to come in. He walks in with a straight face and starts scanning. That’s when my life comes to a stand still. He says that there’s extreme evidence to show our baby has Trisomy 18. My hurt just sank and I didn’t even know what to feel.  

The next two weeks are spent getting an amniocentesis so that  we would know if we would have problems in our future pregnancies. And scheduling our D&E. 

Getting through this last year has definitely been the hardest for my husband and I. We each went through our worst moments at different times and it took a toll on our marriage. We weren’t communicating as much as we thought and we were trying to work through our feelings on our own. We had a CP in May and finally just started to tell each other exactly how we feel. Over the summer, we finally got back to being us. Enjoying ourselves and being happy again with it just being him and I. We stopped putting pressure on ourselves to be pregnant every month. Even though I still get sad sometimes when I start my period, we just go out for sushi, drinks, and/or enjoy adult candy. 

We obviously still have days where we’re just sad. But more recently I’ve been able to talk about her or bring her up and not cry, but smile. I bring her up a lot more now and I don’t care if it makes people uncomfortable because it brings me joy. She happened, she was wanted, and we love her and miss her so much.

175,2048,confidence,<praw.reddit.Reddit object at 0x7f12a630cd90>,,ttcafterloss,"Hey, I just wanted to get some opinions on this post I'm planning on making to facebook. Some people know about my loss, and a good few of those don't know it was TFMR, so it's a bit of a coming out as well as an awareness post, and I feel very nervous. I rarely post on FB to begin with, so I'm afraid I'll look attention seeking or silly. 

I'm really open to opinions on how I could modify it, if you have any.

>October 9th-15th is home to an awareness campaign in which I never imagined I would participate. While I understand that discussion of pregnancy loss is uncomfortable, both for grieving parents and those without the words to express condolences nor the experience to relate, it's a topic that shouldn’t be left in the dark. So, in honor of pregnancy and infant loss awareness week, I’d like to tell my story.


>Somewhere between 10-25% of pregnancies end in loss, and nearly half of those losses occur as miscarriages within the first 6 weeks of pregnancy. So, when I had my labs run for genetic testing at 10 weeks I expected nothing other than confirmation of a healthy pregnancy. I was young and healthy, after all. Low risk. But, after two weeks of anxious waiting, and instead of celebrating our future son, we were busy scheduling tests that would later confirm a fatal Trisomy 13 diagnosis. Upon receiving confirmation we made the most painful decision we've ever been asked to make.


>Our greatest pain didn't stem from losing our baby, rather from the future we lost along with him. Expectations plant themselves the moment we learn about our pregnancies, and those roots are lain under the assumption that they won’t be ripped out. It doesn't matter when your loss occurs, losing an imagined future and deconstructing those expectations is an extremely painful process. I'm lucky to have family and friends who have supported, and continue to support me throughout the process -- from diagnosis to termination and beyond.


>Next time you want to ask a couple when they’ll have kids, or when you feel the need to inquire whether someone is working on turning their wonderful child a big brother or sister, bear in mind that they may have tried. They may have been successful, too. And, unfortunately, they may have lost that baby. That future. Beyond the scope of pregnancy or infant loss, it’s possible that they’ve struggled with fertility, or that their current status is the one they plan to live with.


>Ultimately, the reproductive lives of strangers and loved ones are not open to question unless they open that door for you.

>I will not censor my experience for the comfort of a nosy stranger. I will do my best to make sure no one feels responsibility to locate some non-existent words of wisdom in an attempt to remedy what has happened. But I can’t pretend that he didn’t exist.

>Pregnancy loss is not shameful, no matter how or when it happens. If you are willing to do so, speak up. If you can't, know you're not alone.

She passed in utero. Reading the reflections of loss that many of you have shared has been powerful, and helped me feel less alone. 

Our trying to conceive journey has been long, and with many ups and downs - mostly downs. From delaying going off the pill due to an injury, to not conceiving naturally and accepting we needed a medical work-up, to discovering that we had severe male factor infertility that pushed us from trying to conceive naturally to IVF overnight, to failed IVF cycles, simply getting to pregnancy was hard, and filled with loss. 

When we finally achieved success with IVF#3, I didn't trust that it was going to work out. Every time I went to pee, I was looking for blood and signs of miscarriage. My first trimester was filled with anxiety, even as the positive milestones kept coming - high betas, perfect ultrasounds, NT scan, and low risk through integrated screening. I finally let myself breathe and start planning our life to be with this little girl. But it started falling apart at her anatomy scan, when she was tracking a full two weeks behind. We went through a battery of tests, including screening for infections and several amnio tests. We had a scheduled growth scan 4 weeks after the anatomy scan. In that time, nearly all results came back normal. I had an OB appointment where her heartbeat was strong. We dared to hope that maybe she was just going to be small, but healthy. 

The day before our growth scan, we got the final amnio result back - she had a rare microduplication. They told us that it was a tough case to offer genetic counseling, because there were documented cases where the duplication meant nothing (and it was likely hereditary - so my husband or I could have it, and not know), or it could mean everything - severe neurodevelopmental issues, schizophrenia, skeletal issues, and more. We decided we needed the follow up scan to make any decisions. It took seconds into the scan for the sonographer to tell us, ""There's no heartbeat. I'm so sorry for your loss"". 

I had a D&E over the course of the following two days. We are heartbroken, and miss her beyond measure. We have since found out that my husband carries the duplication, and we need PGD (gene specific testing) on top of IVF. We are working with a genetic testing company to develop the PGD test. I need to wait two cycles before they'll let me go through IVF again, and at least 6 mo from D&E before they'll let me transfer an embryo again. 

All I can think about is trying again - not to replace her, but to give her a sibling who can help take some of this pain away. I have a feeling I'll be here often for this next chapter, whatever it may hold. I'm sorry we're all here, but glad to have found you.

&#x200B;

I had  termination for medical reasons on 9/29 at 20+5.  We found out the week before that our baby (who we later found out was a girl) had spina bifida and related complications.  We decided to terminate.  

&#x200B;

Her name was Nora.  She would have been our first child.   She showed up after about a year of ttc.  Everything was uneventful.  We had our anatomy scan at 18+1.  During a regularly scheduled appointment at 19+2 I was told that our daughter had a problem with her spine and brain, and that I needed to see an MFM immediately.  The doctor wouldn't elaborate.  The appointment lasted 6-8 minutes tops.

&#x200B;

Nora had myelomeningocele spina bifida.  The open lesion on her back was approx. 5-8cm and ran from L1-L3.  She never moved her legs.  She had Arnold Chiari II malformation, where her cerebellum was poorly formed and her hindbrain was herniating through the opening in her skull.  She had severe hydrocephalus.  Her feet were clubbed.  Her corpus callosum was missing.  She was not a candidate for in utero surgery.  

&#x200B;

I miss her.  She was so wanted.  I am struggling with my decision to terminate, but if i could go back I would make the same decision every time.  

&#x200B;

Thanks for reading.
