3,2048,confidence,<praw.reddit.Reddit object at 0x7f12a630cd90>,,ttcafterloss,"You can find my first update in my profile. Essentially we got concerning NIPT results at 12 weeks and then on the day we were supposed to have the CVS test, we found out our baby’s heart stopped at 12 weeks 6 days. I had to wait one full week to get my D&E, which happened this morning.

I always appreciate detailed medical posts as it helps me know what to expect, but I understand that it isn’t for everyone. I am bad at Flair on mobile but this post will have a trigger for medical details and mention of a living child.

Backing up to earlier this week to add some oh-so-pleasant details to these two weeks of horror - I woke up Wednesday with a full body rash. I was in shock and terrified it had something to do with the miscarriage and some kind of infection or something. I hadn’t had the D&E yet so the fetus was still in my uterus. I called my doctor and she reminded me: I am on freaking amoxicillin and clearly had an allergic reaction, which is very common. (And so lovely, I wasn’t even on it for any reason. They made me go on it in advance of the CVS in case of Strep B but then that test never even happened. But the nurse said you should always finish a course of antibiotics once you start, so I had to continue with them for no reason.)

Anyway, my doctor had me stop taking them and start taking Benadryl right away. But it didn’t matter - by Thursday morning, my pre-op appointment, I looked like a superhero movie villain. Swollen face, mouth, ears, and head to toe enormous red splotches and red dots. 

My surgeon came in for the pre-op and her jaw dropped. She couldn’t believe I would have this much of a reaction without breathing issues but I assured her it was all cosmetic and just very itchy. I was literally shaking in the appointment though because I was so uncomfortable and dreading the laminaria and being even more uncomfortable. She said she would skip the laminaria because it can be painful and she didn’t want to make anything worse for me than it already was. Since I was between 12 and 14 weeks, which is right on the borderline of needing them in the first place, she said she can do it without them. I had also been spotting red and cramping lightly the past 48 hours so she said she suspects my body would be ready without them and with just using the oral dilation meds. I almost cried with relief, I was dreading the laminaria so much.

She did have to call anesthesia for a special consult to make sure the surgery could still go through despite the allergic reaction. My heart was in my throat while she was out of the room calling them. I would have lost it if we had to delay the procedure. Luckily, anesthesia signed off as long as I didn’t develop breathing issues or throat swelling and recommended a soft breathing tube either way while I was under in order to be extra safe. 

Surgery was at 7:15 this morning. My doctor gave me Ativan to take Thursday night to help me sleep and be calm in the morning. (I took two, shhh.) I woke up at 4 am to shower thoroughly as they ask you to. My MIL stayed over to take care of my daughter that morning so we gently said goodbye to her and headed out. We arrived at the hospital at 5:15 am to check in. The drive over was somewhat surreal, but I was glad it was early so I was naturally groggy and still under the influence of the Ativan. I do recommend asking for a calming/anti-anxiety pill if you’re comfortable and react well to them (I do). It helped me a lot, especially since my rash was worse than ever today and my entire body felt swollen and beyond itchy. It helped me ignore it as much as possible.

At 6 am, we were still going through the check in process but I had to pause to put the misoprostol pills in my cheeks to dissolve. (Surgeon called the prescription in for me the day before so I could have them with me and take them on time if I was still checking in.) The pills in my cheeks and no water (you’re not allowed anything in your stomach on surgery day) wasn’t exactly pleasant but it didn’t taste bad or sting or anything. 

At 6:45 am I was settled into the pre-op area with my IV in. I was already cramping from the oral meds. I used the bathroom and was bleeding quite a bit. I cried a bit at that moment, it was just a visceral reminder that I was here to physically say goodbye to  our baby, even though they have technically already been gone for a week.

It is here I will mention that every single person who treated me, from the nurses to the surgeon to the residents to the anesthesiologist, treated me with deep kindness and empathy. I am so grateful for those brave, talented, exceptional medical professionals. 

I was left alone for a bit while the staff took care of other things and I had a little bit of another cry. It wasn’t entirely miserable, it more felt like my private moment with the baby to say my final goodbye and tell them a piece of me would always love them even though I wasn’t their mama for long. There was something peaceful about it and I was grateful for the anxiety meds so I could say a proper mental goodbye without being overwhelmed by grief. At this point, they also let my husband back to sit with me and hold my hand while they finalized the room. We were quiet, just holding hands and waiting together.

At 7:15 am, they wheeled me out to the operating room. My husband and I got a little teary when we were separated, there’s something inherently emotional about that moment. I got my biggest bolt of anxiety of the morning heading into the operating room. It was my first surgery and I was intimidated by all the people, lights, and instruments laid out.

My anesthesiologist came over immediately and put something clear into my IV to “get the process started.” I remember maybe 30-60 seconds after that - the nurses wheeling me over to the main table and helping me move, telling me they would get me a warm blanket ASAP bc I was shaking, and then... nothing. Blissful, blissful nothing.

The next thing I remember is waking up in recovery. I was super groggy but there was a sweet nurse right there saying I can rest and keep my eyes closed, just tell them how I feel. I was shaking with cold again and she said that was super normal and they were bringing over a heated blanket. I also had a headache and mumbled that my head hurt. The anesthesiologist was there and put something else in my IV to take care of it. They asked if I wanted my husband and I mumbled a yes and then drifted back to sleep for a bit.

The second time I woke up was about 15 minutes later, warm, no headache, husband there. Not in pain really at all. And immediately also noticed my rash felt better and remembered the anesthesiologist said she would put some antihistamine into my IV for me too, bless her. It made waking up a bit more groggy so they apologized but I didn’t care at all about that, I appreciated it so much, it seriously calmed my rash and make me so much more comfortable. Direct IV meds are amazing and so effective!

I had some water and apple juice but said no to food even though they offered it several times. Within the next half hour, they checked my bleeding on and off and were pleased, I wasn’t bleeding much at all and I was in very very little pain, I honestly felt fine in terms of pain. I was able to get up and go to the bathroom. I was definitely still groggy but I could walk and talk for the most part. And that was that. They discharged me, wheeled me down to the garage, and we went home. 

Looking back now, I was definitely still out of it for all of the wake up and discharge part. I don’t really remember all the details of the conversations I had with the nurses, something about the bleeding and to come back immediately for fever or large clots and... some other stuff I don’t really remember. I also have no idea who wheeled me out, I don’t remember meeting or seeing the person. I hope I thanked him or her.

I passed out in the car and then crawled into bed when I got home and slept for another few hours. 

And now I feel... okay. I honestly do. I for sure am expecting a second wind of grief, I’ve heard there can be serious hormone crashes in the coming weeks and I’m bracing myself. But overall, I feel lucky in some ways that I had a week to process this loss and anticipate the physical procedure. I felt ready for closure by today.

The procedure itself could not have been less scary. It was so fast and painless. 12 hours later and I have taken two 600 mg ibuprofen and more Benadryl and I feel very comfortable. A few on and off uterine cramps and moderate bleeding, but nothing bad at all. No soreness or tenderness in the cervix or vagina at all. I don’t even have a sore throat from the breathing tube, which I’ve heard is common. I ate dinner like normal with my family and am planning a mostly normal day tomorrow, minus some of the more rigorous toddler chasing.

What else? Nothing in the vagina for two weeks, no baths, no swimming. Back in two weeks for post op checkup. No limits on when we can start trying again but they recommend letting one cycle pass before really going for it so I know things are mostly back to normal and I can track the next pregnancy more easily.

So here we are. I’m okay, I think. At least right now. Grateful and thankful for the wonderful medical community that cares for us in these vulnerable times. Donating to safe gynecological surgery access and advocacy groups as much as possible this month - every woman should feel safe and comfortable with her medical care in these situations, no matter the conditions. 

I expect there will be moments in the coming weeks where I’m not okay. And I’m dreading the fear that I think will taint our next pregnancy, if we’re lucky enough to conceive again. But for now, I’m just taking it a day at a time. Looking forward to small, comforting things like a glass of red wine with my family at Thanksgiving next week. That’s about as far ahead as I can think into the future without getting sad, but it’s enough for now.

Sending love and light out into this community. The community that nobody wants to join but absolutely needs once we’re a part of it. I read every miscarriage story differently now. I thought I could feel serious empathy for miscarriage experiences in the past and my heart would truly hurt but now I just really really get it in a way I never would had it not happened to me. I wouldn’t wish this experience on anyone, but I am grateful that I can truly understand the pain my fellow humans are in when these things happen. It’s almost unimaginable what we go through - I’m in awe of our combined strength.

So, I had a MMC that we found out about yesterday. I was supposed to be 10w, but measured 7w3d. I had a couple episodes of decently bad cramping on two different days about a week ago, but no bleeding or spotting whatsoever. I'm in the process of switching doctors due to some negligence in record keeping and proper care, and I have to wait about a week until my appointment with the doctor who will likely handle this. I'm hoping I pass this myself, but it's been about 3 weeks already and obviously, nothing has happened yet.

I know my options, if it doesn't pass on its own, are D&C or medication. I did some [research](https://www.fitpregnancy.com/pregnancy/getting-pregnant/how-risky-having-dc-after-miscarriage) on D&Cs, and found that they significantly increase risk for preterm birth in subsequent pregnancies, they disrupt the microbial balance of the cervix, and increase the propensity for a weakened cervix in subsequent pregnancies as well. In short, the latest research is urging doctors to avoid this procedure when possible. On top of all that, I have a mid-grade prolapsed uterus, so I'm certainly worried about that complicating things with a D&C.

Has anyone here used the medication to take care of a MMC? I read that it's about 95% effective if you miscarry before 9w, which I definitely did.

16,2048,confidence,<praw.reddit.Reddit object at 0x7f12a630cd90>,,ttcafterloss,"Hi all, this will be long.

I had a unicorn pregnancy. My husband and I decided to start trying in January. I was temping and bought OPKs, but we were really just having fun and enjoying each other when we got pregnant on the first cycle. It was surreal, and at 8 weeks, we saw our little jellybean on the ultrasound screen for the first time. We were cautious and hesitant to tell people our news; it seemed too good to be true, but checkup after checkup everything looked good.

I ate healthy foods, took prenatals, and followed my doctor’s advice as I slowly approached my due date and grew bigger and bigger. I was negative for gestational diabetes and group B strep. My blood pressure was perfect for all 40 weeks. I had a textbook healthy pregnancy.  I did everything right. 

We told our friends, family, and colleagues.  We bought furniture, diapers, and clothes. We sang her lullabies and told her all about the things we would do together.  Every night, when my husband came home from work he would kiss me hello and would kiss my belly and say hello to our baby.  We went to the fair and watched the families walking past, all while talking about how next year, that would be us with our baby in our stroller. We were ready. 

I began having contractions at 37 weeks, and at that point I was 2 cm dilated and started losing small pieces of my mucus plug.  I was uncomfortable, but still healthy. My doctor saw me weekly, and had no concerns. The baby was active and had a strong heartbeat.  In retrospect, I think the contractions made it difficult for me to figure out when she stopped moving.  I still can’t pinpoint the last time I felt her move. 

At 40+2, at a routine ultrasound to make sure I could continue to wait to deliver on my own, the tech couldn’t find a heartbeat. Six days prior, she was alive, but now she was dead.  I was so shocked that all I could ask was “What do I do now?”  The doctors talked me through the induction/labor process, but that wasn’t what I meant. I wanted to know what I was supposed to do with my life. For 9 months, we planned and dreamed about life as a family of 3, and now that was gone. 

I delivered her 29 hours later at 40+3.  

In all the scenarios I thought of and dreamed about, I never imagined I would carry my daughter home in an urn.  I’m a little heartbroken every time I see one of my friends post pictures of their new babies online. I sometimes stand in the doorway of the nursery and just look at all we did to prepare for her.  I still don’t know what we’re going to do with all this stuff (who knew a baby could accumulate so much stuff?). 

Overall, I think I’m doing ok. Physically, I’m healing, and I’ll be going back to work soon. I’m a pretty optimistic person at baseline, so I’ve been able to find my silver linings. I’m so thankful for so much, for my husband (I feel like my love for him has grown tenfold throughout all of this), for having a relatively trauma-free birth without surgical intervention, for my family, friends, and coworkers, for knowing I’m young enough to try again.  I’m thankful that my baby knew the warmth and love that we gave her.  I’m grateful for being able to be her home for 9 happy months.

My doctor recommended waiting at least 6-8 months before becoming pregnant (and doing some additional testing to rule out any autoimmune conditions that may have led to her death) so it will be a while before we actively TTC again. In the meanwhile, we’ll lay the groundwork to try again by grieving the loss of our daughter and the dreams we had for her. I’ll get back into shape to get physically healthy to support another pregnancy.  I’ll keep checking in here to process some of my tricky emotions and to celebrate the milestones I should be celebrating with my baby.

<p>I had a unicorn pregnancy. My husband and I decided to start trying in January. I was temping and bought OPKs, but we were really just having fun and enjoying each other when we got pregnant on the first cycle. It was surreal, and at 8 weeks, we saw our little jellybean on the ultrasound screen for the first time. We were cautious and hesitant to tell people our news; it seemed too good to be true, but checkup after checkup everything looked good.</p>

<p>I ate healthy foods, took prenatals, and followed my doctor’s advice as I slowly approached my due date and grew bigger and bigger. I was negative for gestational diabetes and group B strep. My blood pressure was perfect for all 40 weeks. I had a textbook healthy pregnancy.  I did everything right. </p>

<p>We told our friends, family, and colleagues.  We bought furniture, diapers, and clothes. We sang her lullabies and told her all about the things we would do together.  Every night, when my husband came home from work he would kiss me hello and would kiss my belly and say hello to our baby.  We went to the fair and watched the families walking past, all while talking about how next year, that would be us with our baby in our stroller. We were ready. </p>

Hey everyone. It's been almost 1 month since my MC and I just wanted to share something that may be helpful to some of you too. 

I recently went for therapy due to feeling lost & our of control anxiety after my loss. They said a form of healing that may help with the grieving process would be to write a letter to the baby, seal it up and burn it. Anything and everything you need to get off of your chest or want to say.. And if possible to do on the new moon (since new moon brings change and closure).

I have since followed up twice to watch it’s progress. On Monday, it was determined that it is an endometrioma and therefore will not resolve on its own. My doctor recommended laparoscopic surgery to remove the cyst and look for other signs of endometriosis. She said that if I become pregnant again, there is the risk of ovarian torsion if it grows, or the pregnancy moves things around and that would be a very bad emergency.

I am upset for a number of reasons. I’m working to schedule the surgery now, but even if they are able to do it shortly after my next period, it seems like we’ll have to WTT for about 3 months, which feels like such a waste of time. It took us 6 months to get pregnant in the first place, which I know is not that long to many people, but I’m 33 and want to have more than one child. I have this (albeit unfounded) doomed feeling that I will have recurrent MCs and I feel like I’ve already waited too long and my body won’t cooperate.

Also, now it sounds like I likely have endometriosis. I have had normal cycles, always 26 days, give or take 1 day. I have generally gotten positive opk day 12 or 13, with a confirmed temperature rise following. My flow is one heavy day, one moderate day, and two barely there days. I have very mild cramps the first day. How do I have endometriosis with none of the symptoms? Is this going to make it harder for me to get and stay pregnant?

Not to mention the risk of having to remove my entire ovary in the process of removing the endometrioma that my doctor mentioned.

They also found free fluid in my uterine cavity, which hopefully, is left over from ovulation, as they can see on my right ovary a simple cyst indicating recent ovulation. However, I googled it (because I can’t leave well enough alone) and there was a study that showed that fluid in the uterine cavity was associated with almost zero likelihood of implantation in IVF patients. So that seems bad to me.

I know I’m wallowing here, but I just feel doomed, and meanwhile it seems like everyone around me is getting pregnant with little to no struggle. Not much in my life has ever come easy, so I don’t know why I expected this to be any different.

My heart is actually so overjoyed at how beautiful and supportive this corner of the internet has been through the darkest few months of my life.

Backstory if you can't be bothered to peep my post history - I have had 2 miscarriages, back to back with no period in between. It was undoubtedly the roughest few months of my life.

So I just got my period today and I actually felt kind of relieved. I was having pregnancy/luteal phase symptoms all of last week and I was honestly dreading the thought of being pregnant again. I knew as soon as I saw two faint lines I would have the horrific dread and terror deep in my soul that was evident every single second of my 2nd planned pregnancy right until I miscarried. I refused to test, then lo and behold, came my period. 

I think I just need a break from TTC. I need a break from my miscarriages so that when I eventually do fall pregnant in the future maybe I will be able to enjoy it, hopefully enough time has passed by then and I will be more prepared.

Has anyone else had these feelings? I actually feel so good and happy about my decision it feels like a weight off my shoulders.

It’s been almost 9 months since we lost our baby girl. Vienna should be 6 months old now. She’s not. 
We have been trying since it was possible to do so. We went through 6 cycles with no luck. 
We finally started Clomid this last cycle, but nope. No luck. I am taking it hard.
My son is now 3.5 years old. Hubby and I are both 36. And I have BRCA1. The plan was for me to have my risk reduction ovary removal surgery after Vienna’s birth. Now, not only can I not seem to get pregnant, but I’m also getting so paranoid about my risk for ovarian cancer. I had my routine screening studies last month, and my ultrasound was ok, but one of my blood markers was elevated. My OB tried to reassure me and said we would just recheck in 6 weeks. But, now I can’t get pregnant, even with clomid, and literally doing every thing suggested by infertility docs, and one of my inflammatory markers is elevated.
I just can’t. I was supposed to have my family completed by now. I have literally done everything I can to “enhance my odds” of getting pregnant, nothing. We are only getting older.

I have a 3 y/o and my husband and I decided to try again this past August, despite some health issues we thought might stand in the way of our fertility I got pregnant right away. We felt like it was meant to be, I was ecstatic and told him right away. I never imagined experiencing pregnancy loss with my second. When I went in for my 8 wk appointment, no heartbeat, baby measured 6wk 1day. I hadn't had a single cramp, spotting, nothing to indicate that anything was wrong. After confirming no change to baby at 10 weeks I decided to wait and try to m/c naturally (despite my OB encouraging d&c.)

For some reason I felt like I had difficulty finding anyone's stories of m/c that were similar to mine despite looking, so I figured I'd put mine out there in case anyone else goes looking and wants to know.  At 10 weeks I started cramping, and I cramped 24 hrs a day for 4 days straight with no signs of spotting or bleeding. I thought something was wrong with me or my body since I wasn't bleeding. I finally started bleeding and bled for a week without much sign of clots or tissue. 

Early this morning I finally passed two large amounts of tissue in the toilet. For some reason I had this notion that I might be able to see something that resembled an actual fetus, I knew it was unlikely, but was hopeful. For me, it was not like this at all, everything was so bloody I couldn't make out anything. My Dr did not want me to save the tissue, and it was all so sudden (and had woken me up) and I just flushed without thinking very much about it. 

As this day wears on it makes me so sad to be physically separated from my baby, I'm sad that I flushed even though I had no intention of fishing anything out. I just struggle with the notion that I literally flushed what was left of my baby away. I wanted this child so badly and both my husband and I aren't even sure we want to try again because of the toll this has taken on us. This probably all sounds crazy but I thought I might feel better if I just got it all out. 

I am so sorry for anyone else that is struggling with pregnancy/infant loss right now.

So this is now my third miscarriage.  I had a loss at 5 weeks in June and another one at 5 weeks in August, then got pregnant with this one in September.  

After the first two losses I had a pelvic ultrasound that showed an endometrial polyp, but I don't know if that contributed to this loss.  There was no sign of it on this ultrasound, but I don't know if there would be.

The ultrasound people suggested I wait and have another ultrasound in a week or 10 days.  10 days??  How on earth can I wait that long?  I'm not clinging to false hope here.  I stared at that screen and I clearly saw there was no heartbeat.  Doesn't it make more sense to get a second opinion right away so I can make some decisions?

I just want this over.  The idea of waiting to miscarry naturally is unbearable to me. That could take weeks.  I think I want a D&C so I don't have to worry about miscarrying 2 weeks before Christmas.  I also want to test the embryo to see if there's any indication of cause.  I also want to talk to someone to see if they can remove the polyp at the same time.

I don't know what I'm supposed to do now.  Do I still go to my first prenatal appointment scheduled for this Wednesday?  I guess so, since someone's going to have to tell me what the next step is. 

I just feel crushed and defeated.  Why is this so hard?  I can't even imagine trying again after this.  I so desperately want a baby and yet how on earth could I ever feel anything but dread if I get pregnant again?

I got pregnant after my 2nd cycle trying and was shocked. I was sure something was going to go wrong and, sure enough, at 8 weeks exactly I had a D&C for a BO. I'm 36 but the doctors have assured me that this was just bad luck, that the odds are in my favour since I have had no abnormal paps, my periods have been regular even coming off of HBC, and I seem very healthy with no conditions other than having mild IBS and being chubby. I remain unconvinced that things won't go pear-shaped the next time we try.

Of course I've been reading everything I can about MCs and trying to be informed about all of this, but I'm a cynic. I'm going to start therapy this week to try and deal with my feelings of helplessness and fear but I was wondering,  fellow googlers and researchers,  that number that keeps getting quoted to me -1-3% chance of having back to back miscarriages - that seems awfully low. I know part of it is due to the fact that I spend a lot of time on boards and chat groups for people who have suffered losses or who are working through infertility issues, but is that number actually accurate? Are there studies that show that?

i know the ""miscarriage risk calculator"" did me dirty and that facts and figures don't matter one fig when you've gone through the ""unlikely"" outcome yourself, but in a quest to give myself something positive to focus on, is that low number accurate? I feel like if the chances of having a miscarriage are around 1 in 4 and having one doesn't change your odds, wouldn't my next pregnancy have a 25% chance of going the same way again? Do these numbers take into account the different kinds of MCs (e.g. I might have a low chance of a second BO but a CP has better odds).

Context: I&#39;m a worrier. Always have been, starting to look like I always will be. I got pregnant after my 2nd cycle trying and was shocked. I was sure something was going to go wrong and, sure enough, at 8 weeks exactly I had a D&amp;C for a BO. I&#39;m 36 but the doctors have assured me that this was just bad luck, that the odds are in my favour since I have had no abnormal paps, my periods have been regular even coming off of HBC, and I seem very healthy with no conditions other than having mild IBS and being chubby. I remain unconvinced that things won&#39;t go pear-shaped the next time we try.</p>

<p>Of course I&#39;ve been reading everything I can about MCs and trying to be informed about all of this, but I&#39;m a cynic. I&#39;m going to start therapy this week to try and deal with my feelings of helplessness and fear but I was wondering,  fellow googlers and researchers,  that number that keeps getting quoted to me -1-3% chance of having back to back miscarriages - that seems awfully low. I know part of it is due to the fact that I spend a lot of time on boards and chat groups for people who have suffered losses or who are working through infertility issues, but is that number actually accurate? Are there studies that show that?</p>

<p>i know the &quot;miscarriage risk calculator&quot; did me dirty and that facts and figures don&#39;t matter one fig when you&#39;ve gone through the &quot;unlikely&quot; outcome yourself, but in a quest to give myself something positive to focus on, is that low number accurate? I feel like if the chances of having a miscarriage are around 1 in 4 and having one doesn&#39;t change your odds, wouldn&#39;t my next pregnancy have a 25% chance of going the same way again? Do these numbers take into account the different kinds of MCs (e.g. I might have a low chance of a second BO but a CP has better odds).</p>

<p>Even if the news is bad, I&#39;d like to know. help me, math. You&#39;re my only hope.</p>

&#x200B;

I had an MMC on 9/11, D&C on 9/14, and my new cycle started on 10/21 after taking Provera to kick start my period. We did an HCG on 10/19 and it was at 4, so I was officially cleared to start trying again. On CD 3-7 I take Femara to help me ovulate. 

&#x200B;

I got a positive OPK on CD 9 (10/29), and then again on CD 10, and finally a lower one on CD 11. The app (Femometer) was saying I ovulated on 10/31 based on the pics/scores they gave my strips. Well, I got blood work on 11/8 to test my progesterone level to see if I ovulated correctly and it was a mid-range number (2.5). So my OB said I didn't ovulate and to get started on my next cycle.

&#x200B;

I had some O-like cramping on Saturday so I was curious and took an OPK and it was HIGH (Femometer said peak). On my supposed last ovulation the highest number was 110. This Saturday it was 123 and then Sunday 143. This morning it was 73, so I supposedly ovulated on Sunday the 11th.

&#x200B;

So after all that background...what is going on?! Did I ovulate super late, CD 22, and if so, why would it have surged and shown ovulation earlier in my cycle?

I'm a mod over at r/infertility and we have an AMA coming up on 11/13 we'd like to share with others in the TTC/infertility community.

The AMA will be on Tues Nov 13th from 9-11 am CST / 3-5 pm GMT. A little preview:

Elyse Ash, the Founder and CEO of [Fruitful Fertility](https://www.fruitfulfertility.org/) will be speaking about the free mentorship program that matches women currently dealing with infertility and those who have previously struggled with infertility.

Just want some feedback on how your numbers went down after being treated with  Methotrexate for an ectopic.  I know everyone is different, just looking for what others have been through.

Below is my background...

Started bleeding/spotting a 4+4

Saw the Dr at 5 weeks on Oct 10 my Hcg was 190

oct 12 Hcg was \~ 400 - thought it was a viable pregnancy since it doubled

oct 16 HCG only \~800 - didn't get these results till oct 18 in the am.  

oct 18 - Got in for an emergency ultrasound.  as i am leaving get the call that its ectopic.  Get in to see the on call OB, since my numbers are low, they couldn't tell for sure, but there was nothing in my uterus and 90% sure ectopic in the right tube. \[my appendix ruptured when i was 6 and i needed emergency surgery...i have now seen that this is one of the potential 'causes' for ectopic\]  got Hcg on the 18 after talking to the Ob and it went down to 536.  looked like i was miscarrying on my own.

oct 20 went up slightly to 548

oct 22 went up to 552 - dr calls and says i need Methotrexate.

oct 23 Hcg is 501... tried and failed at getting the Methotrexate shot because the orignal OB didn't order the correct blood work, so need to wait to make sure my kidneys are working right

oct 24 - get the shot of Methotrexate - hcg is 601

oct 27 (day 4) hcg is 770 \[i get worried at this point because it went up...still spotting this whole time\] 

oct 28 spotting stops and my face breaks out a bit...this usually only happens before my period, so i think that the shot must have worked cuz i probably had a drop in hormones to cause the break out.

oct 30 (day 7) hcg drops to 649 \[im supposed to go every week now, but my dr says to go again to make sure its goes down more since it went up on day 4...numbers are down 15%\]

nov 1 hcg is 505  

nov 5 dr calls and says to get hcg early today because she is worried that my numbers plateaued. hcg is 202, so it looks like the shot its successful.  number went down 60% since blood work 4 days ago and 68% since day 7.

going forward i am going to get tested weekly...i am just anxious to not have blood tests anymore.  At one point i had 13 blood draws in 26 days...any advise is greatly appreciated.

68,2048,confidence,<praw.reddit.Reddit object at 0x7f12a630cd90>,,ttcafterloss,"New here; somewhat active on BabyBumps. Second pregnancy, first loss, and just feeling so stunned and low. It’s so bizarre to feel like it’s impossible that this is real and yet it’s so. impossibly. real. all at once.

We received a call Monday with our NIPT results. As soon as I heard my OBGYN’s voice on the line, my heart sank. It’s never the doctor calling directly unless there’s bad news. 

The blood test showed high risk for Trisomy 13, which is not compatible with life. Monday was a blur of confusion and grief and terror. Tuesday we met with the genetic counselor and learned NIPT often shows a false positive for Trisomy 13, so she recommended a CVS to start with for further testing before making any decisions. We left with some hope, although it was still tempered.

CVS was scheduled for yesterday. The ultrasound tech came in before the doctor to do the scan. I think part of me knew what had happened from the moment she started. The fetus was too still and the so-obvious flickering heartbeat we saw on our 7 week and 10 week scans wasn’t there. I told myself maybe it was just weird angles and looked away. I know better than to ask the techs anything, they just say the doctor will explain. She left quietly and the doctor came in. He started the scan again and I knew what was coming of course. He paused over the torso for a long time and I knew. 

The heartbeat apparently stopped sometime in the last 24 hours, so sometime around 12 weeks 6 days. I would have been 13 weeks today.

My emotions have been all over the place. I cried hard for awhile when the doctor said the words out loud but then you know how it is, you have to kind of shut off the emotions to listen to what happens next, instructions, what this all means, etc. So I went into this numb “information and task” mode yesterday and honestly think I convinced myself I’m okay in some ways. But then crashed last night and sobbed again for four hours. Now I’m home alone for the first time since yesterday and just laying in bed feeling like shit, for lack of a better way to put it.

So many random things all hurt and in all different ways.

I have to have a D&E since I’m 13+ weeks and there are only 3 doctors at my hospital who do them that far along so I have to wait until Thursday and Friday next week to get the surgery. It feels like torture to have to wait a week but I guess it’s not uncommon to have to wait so I guess that’s just what I have to do. I hate this and just want it to be over.

This is my second pregnancy and I started showing early so maternity clothes are the only things that fit me right now. Looking down at my obvious belly and pulling on those full-band pants is such a simple cruelty right now.

Forgot to turn the Ovia app off and got my “13 weeks!” email this morning. That was like taking a bullet.

The death of ideas. Being pregnant at Christmas. Summer 2019 maternity leave. A round, cute baby bump. That last push and the baby is here and you meet them for the first time, that incredible, indescribable feeling. Introducing my daughter to her sibling. Mourning so much more than a physical loss.

My CEO had to send a note to my entire company (only 30 people and we’re mostly women and mostly all close, but still) letting them know what happened. I told everyone I was pregnant just last week because we had a 3-day team meeting to plan for 2019  (I’m on the leadership team so there was an impact of my being out for four months next year and we needed to incorporate it in the plan). I was 11 weeks and had had two good scans already and it just felt like the right time. But seeing that email go out (she forwarded it to me after) and the words in it, about me, about the baby - I don’t know why that was the thing that brought it home, but it just killed me. Something about the regret of sharing my excitement so nakedly, and then having so many people know that it’s been lost just feels so shameful and sick and bad. I can’t really describe it, but it just makes it too real and embarrassing, even though I obviously know logically that miscarriage is not embarrassing at all. Regret sharing that broadly, that early, for sure.

My husband is wonderful and has his own pain in this, I know, along with our shared pain. He held me for a long time last night and said all the right things but I know he can’t quite understand how I’m feeling with the physicality of everything / the fact that this is all happening in my body. Which is okay, but feels a little lonely.

And my daughter. Beautiful, perfect, naughty, hilarious two year old daughter. She knows I’m sad and we gently explained why. But of course I just feel guilty for bringing any sadness or confusion into her world. And a little scared and sorry because I know I’m not going to be able to be her best mama here for a little while. And at the same time, so beyond grateful that I have her. First time moms who lost your little ones - I am so fucking sorry for you. I fully acknowledge that this would be much harder for me had it been my first. You are so brave.

So that’s it I guess. I know time will pass and I will heal and someday hopefully hold another child in my arms but there is such a distinct sense of before and after now. Never again will I trust so blindly. Never again will I hope so much. Never again will I visualize and dream and plan so many details that can be stolen away.

Or maybe time will dull and I will. Just not today.

70,2048,confidence,<praw.reddit.Reddit object at 0x7f12a630cd90>,,ttcafterloss,"This is our 3rd IUI cycle. I had an ectopic pregnancy with our 1st IUI. Found out I was pregnant mid-July. Found out it was ectopic early-August. 

This IUI was a nightmare from the start. We upped my dosage because I only produced one mature follicle last time. Well this cycle I got food poisoning in the middle of the tine I was taking my Letrozole. So when I went in for my scan on CD9 I had 2 follicles but they were only 13mm. So I had to take my Letrozole for an extra 3 days. Then did the IUI on CD16.

Today is 11dpiui and I have had BFNs for the last 3 days. Today's had me breaking down in the shower. I'm just sad. My 31st birthday is next week. My sister is having her 3rd baby the day before my birthday. And I'm supposed to be pregnant. But I'm not. And instead I have to keep doing these stupid IUIs.

I first joined this community after have a TFMR at almost 26 weeks. Had had the Harmony test which showed lowest risk categories, then the 20w anatomy scan showed some anomalies that were expected to not be too much of a big deal considering Harmony results, went to see an MFM specialist and got a better ultrasound which showed additional issues, then got an amnio which revealed T21 diagnosis but some of the issues found on the second ultrasound were not common to T21 so would have been even more issues on top of that diagnosis... so then we TFMR. (And during that delivery I found out I have PTSD from my first birth with my now 3 year old, so that was a nice addition to a truly terrible day...)

Was pregnant again after my end of Aug period and then this Monday I went in for my first appointment at 10 weeks with the MFM, but when she went to do an ultrasound at the end of the appointment I knew something was wrong. The machine wasn’t great but she basically couldn’t see much of anything except maybe a tiny shadow when really zoomed, so she sent me to their radiology department for a better ultrasound (had to wait 5 hours) which confirmed that the baby had stopped developing at about 6 weeks and had no heartbeat. Was holding up on because I kind of knew what was coming after the first ultrasound, but then when the radiologist was handing me the report she asked “you have a tiny baby at home now right?” But no, I don’t. And then I lost it and had to walk past all the other pregnant ladies in the waiting room trying not to completely lose it and start sobbing loudly.

Had the D&C today (which went well, all things considered), they’re going to karyotype test the embryo to see if there was another trisomy. Have to go back for another blood draw on Saturday to make sure my HCG has dropped.

I feel so betrayed by my body. Over 4 weeks that my body just didn’t notice the MMC. And what’s with the first and then maybe another trisomy?? After the TFMR they confirmed that it was an accidental form of T21 (rather than inheritable form) but are my eggs just damaged now or something? And wtf Harmony?! And then they refused to refund me because it was in the acceptable margin of error. IM NOT JUST A NUMBER, IM A PERSON! I don’t care that my case falls into acceptable statistics, your test still didn’t work for me. Jerks. You might be able to tell I have some leftover anger here...

Anyways I’ve started rambling. So hi, I’m back. I hope I didn’t offend or upset anyone.

Although my bleeding has had moments where it was lighter, it has never stopped and has been like a normal period the last few weeks.

I called my doctor and left a message with his assistant but did not receive a call back so I left work and went to the ER.

They did an ultrasound and labs. They said my HCG is at 350 and that I still have ""fluid and debris"" in my uterus so the bleeding will not stop until the tissue passed fully.

The bleeding is now like a regular period but I have not stopped bleeding.

My doctor's office finally called me back-a week later. The assistant said the doctor said that it's normal to have a heavy period after a miscarriage and that unless I am going through multiple pads an hour than there is no cause for concern. I told the assistant last week that I had yet to stop bleeding then and still hadn't and that this isn't my friggin PERIOD because I still have tissue remaining. All she said was ""OH, well I will email him"". She said that my doctor is working in the hospital today so I may not get a call back until Friday or even MONDAY. I asked can one of the other doctors call me, she said she didn't know.


Am I overreacting or is this a cause for concern? I am really getting concerned. They won't even see me until the 21st.

Today I saw you crying 

I sent you lots of love 

I hope that you can feel it 

I'm here just up above 



Today I jumped from cloud to cloud 

And flew across the sky 

And God told me all about you 

And why you often cry 



He told me that you were special 

And your love for me is deep 

He told me that one day I'll meet you here 

And in your arms is where I'll leap 



I met a nice man the other day 

He sat me on his knee 

He told me that he knew you, Mom 

And do you know what else he told me? 



He told me all about you 

About your pretty face 

About your kindness, love and joy 

About your sweet grace 



I told that man I knew you 

Cause we were once so close 

I grew in your belly, Mommy 

Just beneath your clothes 



I told that man you talked to me 

And prayed for me each night 

And how I felt your love right there 

And how you would hug me tight 



No, you're not a stranger, Mom 

Although we're now apart 

It's really not that far, Mommy 

I know I'm in your heart 



I can't wait to see you, Mommy 

God says you'll be here soon 

Until then, I'm with you

After a bad 6 week scan due to spotting, I had to wait a whole two weeks for today’s scan. We were traveling during this time, so we got to tell friends and family “don’t get excited: catzrgood is pregnant .  . .but the doctor is not optimistic and we won’t know for sure until we get home. But she still has all the pregnancy hormones so she’s super duper tired.”

The not knowing was the absolute worst. I sort of felt like my symptoms were fading but then again most were still there. I had spotting off and on but also that can be normal, and no cramps. My gut feeling kept flip-flopping on what the outcome would be even though I knew most likely it would not be good.

At 6 weeks exactly my sac measured  5 weeks or less and had a yolk but that’s all.
At 8 weeks today I had a fetal pole measuring about 6weeks 3 days but no heartbeat.
I got my BFP at 3 weeks 4 days, 10 dpo and was tracking everything so I knew my dates were right.

My husband and I are sad obviously but we are ok. This was our first pregnancy and it was conceived on month three of trying, but actually the first month we hit more than one fertile day. So we are optimistic for conceiving again and I am really looking forward to all the projects I will have more time and energy to get done now! And as soon as I got my first bit of blood over two weeks ago, I got myself a ticket to a special one-time concert to my favorite band that is in another state, as an emotional insurance policy. Just to have something to look forward to. Now I’m going to book my flight.

My D&C is tomorrow and the doc said it could take a few months to ovulate again, but I’m already an old pro at tracking so it should be easy to get back to that. I tracked for 8-9 months before trying. I like data. In fact it was kind of difficult when first pregnant to not have anything to track so I just peed on a million sticks and taped them to my bathroom wall like a weird shrine. I kind of want to save them but they are filled with urine so idk.

90,2048,confidence,<praw.reddit.Reddit object at 0x7f12a630cd90>,,ttcafterloss,"Guys,

So back in Spring 2018 I found out I had PCOS. Cue much crying, anger, confusion (I've been pregnant twice with no issues conceiving) and the beginning of this stage of my journey. This was after about 6 months of unsuccessful TTC. My doctor hadn't been originally worried until I mentioned that we were pregnant twice, neither with any issues, but suddenly we couldn't conceive. Things didn't add up. She sent me for full blood panels, ultrasounds, you name it. We found a ""cyst of considerable size"" and off we went for an MRI and referral to an OB/GYN.

We had our MRI and found multiple cysts on each ovary and were told that he was thinking of surgery with a ""2-for-1"" style approach. He wanted to hit ""Reset"" on my fertility. He would go it, get rid of the cysts that looked concerning, do a D&C, do a dye test of my fallopian tubes to be sure they were open, working, and happy, and off we would go to screw like bunnies and make a million babies. (because as my OB/GYN said ""you should go and make more cute babies! Because that's what you make!"").

Well after the MRI results came back and he really seemed to look at the cysts, they weren't of concern. So he started me on Letrozole (Femara) to help kick my ovaries into high gear to force ovulation and to get me pregnant. It's been 6 months of said protocol, with 1 dosage increase and nothing. I've had increased pelvic pain around ovulation, narrowly avoided ending up in hospital a few times due to the pain (I'm stubborn okay. I can't help it) and have had issues with severe vertigo during ovulation *week* and put on an ""as needed"" medication when I have the vertigo issues.

This Monday I had another visit with the OB/GYN and said I was at the end of my rope. I don't know what to do, we are coming up on another full year since we started this process and we haven't had as much as a single ""pregnancy scare"" every month I have pretty much gone ""it's not happened this month. This sucks, moving on, bring on the period, and the cramps, the tampons, all of it. Let's start over"". I mentioned the pelvic pain, the quality of my life as a result of the pain, and he asked me some questions and poked around.

GUYS!! We are finally actually doing the surgery!!! Instead of removing cysts he is going to check me for endometriosis, and presumably treat it should I have it, check my fallopian tubes, do a D&C, and a couple other things that I forget off hand (and couldn't read on the forms because doctor handwriting is awesome).

While he's in there, he will likely be able to see if I do indeed have some level of prolapse in my pelvic organs (another thing I mentioned since I'm oh, so familiar with my lady parts, my cervix feels like it's down and in front of my vagina - like the heel area of the sock versus the top of my vagina - like the toe area of the sock for lack of a better analogy). 

So yeah. I'm ready. I'm terrified, I need to do way too much between now and then and I don't have enough time. I am scared of the pain, the recovery and all the unknowns that are coming with this surgery since many things won't be answered until I'm under anesthetic and I can't answer things myself so they have to ask my DH, plus what is going to happen with my LC during my recovery period and how that will all play out.  But I'm ready. It's another like 2-3 months were I can't get pregnant, but this will be worth it since this is actual tangible progress.

<p>So back in Spring 2018 I found out I had PCOS. Cue much crying, anger, confusion (I&#39;ve been pregnant twice with no issues conceiving) and the beginning of this stage of my journey. This was after about 6 months of unsuccessful TTC. My doctor hadn&#39;t been originally worried until I mentioned that we were pregnant twice, neither with any issues, but suddenly we couldn&#39;t conceive. Things didn&#39;t add up. She sent me for full blood panels, ultrasounds, you name it. We found a &quot;cyst of considerable size&quot; and off we went for an MRI and referral to an OB/GYN.</p>

<p>We had our MRI and found multiple cysts on each ovary and were told that he was thinking of surgery with a &quot;2-for-1&quot; style approach. He wanted to hit &quot;Reset&quot; on my fertility. He would go it, get rid of the cysts that looked concerning, do a D&amp;C, do a dye test of my fallopian tubes to be sure they were open, working, and happy, and off we would go to screw like bunnies and make a million babies. (because as my OB/GYN said &quot;you should go and make more cute babies! Because that&#39;s what you make!&quot;).</p>

<p>Well after the MRI results came back and he really seemed to look at the cysts, they weren&#39;t of concern. So he started me on Letrozole (Femara) to help kick my ovaries into high gear to force ovulation and to get me pregnant. It&#39;s been 6 months of said protocol, with 1 dosage increase and nothing. I&#39;ve had increased pelvic pain around ovulation, narrowly avoided ending up in hospital a few times due to the pain (I&#39;m stubborn okay. I can&#39;t help it) and have had issues with severe vertigo during ovulation <em>week</em> and put on an &quot;as needed&quot; medication when I have the vertigo issues.</p>

<p>This Monday I had another visit with the OB/GYN and said I was at the end of my rope. I don&#39;t know what to do, we are coming up on another full year since we started this process and we haven&#39;t had as much as a single &quot;pregnancy scare&quot; every month I have pretty much gone &quot;it&#39;s not happened this month. This sucks, moving on, bring on the period, and the cramps, the tampons, all of it. Let&#39;s start over&quot;. I mentioned the pelvic pain, the quality of my life as a result of the pain, and he asked me some questions and poked around.</p>

<p>GUYS!! We are finally actually doing the surgery!!! Instead of removing cysts he is going to check me for endometriosis, and presumably treat it should I have it, check my fallopian tubes, do a D&amp;C, and a couple other things that I forget off hand (and couldn&#39;t read on the forms because doctor handwriting is awesome). It&#39;s not for another month (December 19) but we have a date. I&#39;m getting looked at and taken seriously. Even if this doesn&#39;t fix my fertility, we are going to be treated for some of the other issues.</p>

* I lost my son in January 2018 at 21 weeks
* I live in Australia
* One of my closest friends moved away from Australia to the States about 5 years ago. We've stayed close and have visited back and forth at least once a year.  We aren't as close as we once were, but I still consider(ed) her one of my closes friends up to this year.
* I am travelling home to Canada for 2 months starting in a week
* When I lost my son, I texted her to let her know, and give her some small details about what happened.  She responded quickly with an I'm so sorry message, not asking for any more info or really asking me anything in particular.  She sent me a random message about 4 months after that about something unrelated to my loss, and then messaged me a week ago to ask when we were going to catch up while I'm in North America for 2 months. Literally 3 messages in almost 10 months. 

So - the WWYD - I really don't want to see her.  I'm disapointed in her reaction to my loss, as one of my closest friends I would have at least liked her to maintain the level of communication we had before, which she didn't.  I would have liked for her to check in with me at least once to see how I was doing - she didn't.  

All my friends and family are saying to let it go and just see her, don't blow up the friendship over this - but I don't know if I can look past it. Literally everyone in my life that I can think of, close or distant, was more sympathetic and responsive than she was. 

What would you do? Would you try and move past it?  Am I being too petty?

I sent them an email telling them to stop sending me shit (in a nicer way). I gave them my info to REMOVE ME from their list. 

Just now, I got sent a long, detailed survey about my baby's feeding habits. All kinds of stuff; their weight, their height, the time, detailed stuff about their feeding. It even included a list of local hospitals (""Where did you deliver?""). It's very formula focused, so I suspect it's a marketing research survey for Enfamil or similar. I could be wrong, maybe it originated from information from the hospital (which is even more fucked). But that's my suspicion. 

This is the first question of the survey:

I got back the pathology results a few days ago following the loss of my son at 23.3 weeks. He was born alive, but died about a minute after. 

As I expected, there was nothing wrong with my son. I'd had excellent prenatal care and every test and scan showed that he was growing and developing as he should have. 

However, the conclusion after placental examination was a placental separation with hemmorhage/partial abruption. I was also apparently low on amniotic fluid, even though I'd just had my anatomy scan a few weeks before and the placenta and fluid levels looked ideal. 

I had a subchorionic hematoma which caused a bleed daily from weeks 7-15. The last two months of my pregnancy were happy and uneventful. But I specifically asked my doctors about the risk of placental abruption, and in both the US and UK they said I had nothing to worry about. 

So...now I'm terrified to be pregnant again. My husband and I have access to an excellent fertility clinic in the US. Our son was conceived via IUI, although they found no medical reasons for why I didn't get pregnant on our own after trying for over a year. Although I'm 40, I have a high egg count and my hormone levels are very good. According to my RE, closer to that of a woman 10 years younger in fact. 

We can apparently make a healthy baby, I just can't seem to carry one.

My husband has a cousin in her mid 20's (in the UK, where we live) who is unmarried and has a toddler daughter from a healthy pregnancy. The pregnancy was a surprise from a trip abroad and the father is not in the picture. She's been very kind and supportive and has said often how much she loved being pregnant and would love to be pregnant again. 

Given these factors, I don't think it's an outlandish idea for us to ask her to be a surrogate, since my chances of undergoing IVF and having some quality embryos are decent. I don't want to pin all my hopes on her, but I don't think it would be too crazy of an idea.

I’m gonna do all the things I took for granted because this was going to be my “ last baby” and i didn’t want to plan baby showers or take belly bump photos. Now I want to do it all. I am actually looking forward to my morning sickness again. </p>

<p>I’m just venting. I know this is all normal but I’m just trying to process this while the whole world is still going and my mine has stopped moving since this past Monday. </p>

I'm also sorry in advance if my formatting is weird since I'm on mobile...

 I am 25F and he is 34M. I had a miscarriage at 9wks early 2016, and we have been ttc for a year and a half now. The past year I was having irregular periods and diagnosed with PCOS by a fertility doctor. In June, the doctor pretty much told us our chances of conceiving on our own is 4% and we would have a higher chance with an IUI or IVF, both of which are not options for us. 

Since then I've been working on eating healthier, taking prenatals, Synthroid for my thyroid, and Metformin to help regulate ovulation and have had regular cycles for the past 3 months. Since my cycles have been regular and I feel like I've been handling work stress a lot better, I've been really hopeful and I want to keep ttc, but my husband has been really distraught since hearing those chances and work has been very stressful for him. Yesterday was extremely hard on him since he talked to a lot of people at work saying they were taking their kids trick treating and he was really quiet when he got home. I tried to encourage him and tell him that 4% doesn't matter now since my cycles are you more consistent and I've lost weight but that number is haunting him... We both absolutely want kids but I don't know what to say or do anymore. I do all the cooking, finances, and chores so when he comes home he doesn't have to feel even more stressed... I've tried to get us both to go out more and have date nights, talk about things other than ttc, etc... But I just don't know anymore because now he just wants to be alone a lot of the time and it's heartbreaking.

Fast forward to Sunday night, I’m sitting on the toilet and something felt terribly wrong. I tried to stand and couldn’t, the pain was excruciating. We went to the ER again, in hindsight we should have called 911, I have no idea how I survived the car ride with the pain it caused. They didn’t even give me meds right away, just let me suffer in the ER because I couldn’t even sit still. All the morphine in the world didn’t end this pain, the only thing that helped was when they put me to sleep to do the surgery. It was thankfully laparoscopic, so minimal scars but I’m still beyond bloated and I was told I still had some blood in my cavity and it will take me longer to heal than others.

&#x200B;

Taking a breath and coming out of lurkerdom to try and find a place to get support and be supportive.

My son Theo was born at 23 weeks 5 days on 10/6/2018; I developed severe preeclampsia and HELLP syndrome (very rapidly and without warning). Went into the hospital for a check on 10/5/2018 because I though I was habing gallbladder issues - nope just my liver throwing a raging tantrum. Platelet count was at 21,000. The OB on call held my hand and told me I had to deliver within 12 hours or risk death and/or permanent organ damage.

They had to transfuse four units of platelets, two before and two during, my c-section. I had to be under GA and I had a classical internal incision due to his small size - an updated ultrasound showed him as measuring nearly a full month behind. At his 22 week ultrasound he had been 2 weeks behind - but my husband and I are shorter and no one was overly concerned. Little did we know he hadn’t grown much past that point. He weighed 310 grams upon arrival.

My husband held him and talked to him and cuddled him for an hour until I came into recovery and woke up - I got to hold him during his last fifteen minutes of life. I barely remember and it breaks my heart. Our only solace is that it was peaceful for him and he spent his whole life being loved by us.

I am so devastated. My body failed us both and I hate it for this. I want my baby back. I hate that I’m picking out an urn and not picking items for a registry. My best friend gave birth 10/1/2018 and I feel so jealous and bitter that I haven’t been able to look at her baby’s pictures. I’m angry my life got turned upside down and I don’t have any inkling of how to turn it right side up. I miss my Theo so much it is a physical ache.

To keep it relevant to TTC, my next pregnancy will be very high risk because of how early I developed my health issues. Oh and it will definitely be a c-section next time - if there is a next time. Doctor has cautioned holding off on TTC for minimum 10 months and my heart is screaming that it’s too long. Then I feel guilty for wanting another baby when my first child hasn’t even been gone a month.

Support groups in my area aren’t really an option - we’ve called a few contacts the hospital social worker gave us but no one has contacted us back and we think some of the group might just be defunct.

So my son was stillborn in July at 32 weeks (we found out he’d passed at 31+5) due to an undiagnosed severe placental insufficiency and secondary IUGR.

All things considered, I’ve been doing pretty well. I’m back at work, I attend my grief counselling, I have huge amounts of support from family and friends and haven’t encountered too many idiots or people saying the wrong thing or being triggered by the real world etc. I’ve been coping with what seems like the incessant amount of pregnancy announcements and invitations to baby showers - probably the only thing that really sets me off is hearing people complain about their pregnancies. 

We got the ok to try again in September, and while I haven’t been meticulously tracking ovulation or BBTs or OPKs or anything, we’ve been trying to have sex at roughly the right time and see what happens. I got a bit excited last month because my period was 2 days late - right as I’m thinking of testing, AF shows up. No biggie, I don’t really know what to expect of my cycles right now and having a 30 day cycle instead of a 28 day cycle isn’t a big deviance - prior to pregnancy I was a pretty regular 28/29 day cycle.

I’m now on day 32 of this cycle and while part of me wants to test, I actually think I’m more nervous of seeing a negative test than I would be if I just wait a bit longer and see if AF shows up. My cycles may still be out of whack. I know I’m being paranoid about symptom spotting, and I also know that pregnancy symptoms with my last pregnancy didn’t really become obvious until my period was about a week late, so I don’t trust myself when I notice a bit of nausea in the morning (especially because I have both fibromyalgia and anxiety, which both manifest in mild nausea fairly regularly). 

I was expecting to be anxious during a subsequent pregnancy - especially as I face a 20% chance of the same placental issues happening again, and there’s absolutely nothing I can do to prevent it - but I didn’t expect to be this nervous right before a *potential* pregnancy. I don’t even know if I’d want to tell my husband right away. I definitely don’t intend to publically announce it next time (on Facebook etc). I have a new fear of miscarrying that I didn’t have before, probably because my eyes have now been opened in regards to how common that is (we all know the statistics but never think it will happen to us until it happens, and I can’t shake that now). I’m scared that if I face placental insufficiency again, my child might not survive or might be disabled or premature or both. My doctors tell me to focus on the 80% chance that everything will go just fine, easier said than done! But I’m trying.

I don’t know, I think I just needed to express these feelings and this is one of the safest spaces I have. I could talk to my husband about it, but while he’s amazing and sympathetic I don’t think he quite understands the level of mistrust I have in my body now and the fear that entails. I also don’t know whether I should test and get it over with, or wait another few days and see what my body’s doing.  I’m still very new to the TTC club and I’m not used to having to actively try for a baby and going through the experience of seeing negative HPTs when hoping for a positive.

I was on the pill but hadn't taken it for a week due to typical wedding stress. I began bleeding heavily mid-pack and it was like no period I'd ever had. I took a test and it was positive. I was about 5 weeks pregnant. 

Afterwards I stayed on the pill for another 6 months before going off and TTC for real. Over the next 16 months I was diagnosed with pcos, tried multiple medications, but wasn't getting a regular period or ovulating. My progesterone was horrible and I was referred to a fertility specialist. 

We decided to stop TTC and work on our health. We went on vacation to Colorado and had the time of our lives. When we got back I met with a new doctor and was prescribed a weight loss pill. I decided to wait 2 weeks just in case. It was good I did because at exactly 4 weeks I took a test and it turned positive immediately.

We had ultrasounds at 5w2d, 6w2d, and 8w2d. My progesterone was 22 early on and my hcg was tripling in 2 days. We were cautiously optimistic but after the last US and seeing everything looked great we let ourselves get excited. I kept seeing posts about missed miscarriages and always hid them because I didn't want to think about that happening to me. 

At 9w I over exerted myself and had some bad cramping that night. My doctors office said if there was no blood we were okay. But they were wrong. At 10w my husband and I went to an elective US. He hadn't been at my last two and wanted to see the baby before we announced on Halloween. We already had our announcement photos taken as well.  There we found out our baby had no heartbeat. 

We went to the ER afterwards and had another US. It showed our baby died at 9w2d and I had two SCHs. The doctor on call wanted me to wait until Monday for a D&C but I couldn't go home and wait so she reluctantly did it that day. Afterwards she just told me I needed to lose weight to carry a healthy baby and that was it.

142,2048,confidence,<praw.reddit.Reddit object at 0x7f12a630cd90>,,ttcafterloss,"I'm currently in the middle of what I think is my third chemical pregnancy. Both times before, I had barely even a line and immediately started my period after finding out. This time, I have no idea how far along I was because my cycle was odd and I had a pretty dark line on early Monday morning. I had been testing prior but got all negatives up to two days before my positive test. I was cramping that entire time, and then I started bleeding lightly, which then turned moderate about twelve hours after I got my positive. I'm still cramping and bleeding at this point, bright red.

I took two further tests yesterday. The first was significantly lighter than my positive and the second was barely even noticeable. I probably shouldn't have tested quite as much, but I was freaking out.

I just took another test (about two days after my positive), to make sure my hcg was going down, and it's actually slightly darker than the my test from yesterday. I've included a picture of all four of my tests.

So my questions are this:

Is this normal? Should I just assume my tests are all off because of urine concentration? Have I just tested too often to see my hcg going down? I've read online that many people with chemical pregnancies got a negative test before their bleeding even started. Should I be concerned that my hcg may possibly be going back up, as I've read that may be related to an ectopic pregnancy? Should I just stop testing or wait a week and test again to make sure my levels have gone down? 

I have no idea what I'm doing as the last two chemical pregnancies felt just like a regular period and this feels nothing like it. I have extremely sore boobs and some mild nausea still. I apologize if I've asked some commonly asked questions. I may have missed them when I searched through the sub.

I’ve been looking at this sub for a week or so now, and several of you reached out to me over the past couple weeks. It feels a lot longer, like time really slowed down this month though. My first pregnancy ended at 21 weeks in TFMR. We went through the heartbreaking but typical steps- testing that makes you anxious, then an amnio that confirms it all. It was over less than a week ago. 

My days are up and down. I felt pretty stable yesterday, but then I woke up sobbing in the middle of the night. My milk started yesterday, too. It’s so uncomfortable. 

Through this, the only thing that brings me hope is the thought of TTC again. My doctor said to wait until I have one period, but that’s for dating purposes. It’s supposedly possible for get pregnant two weeks after. Am I crazy for wanting to try again so soon?

I should be 9+1 today (due 2 June). In the past two days I've had two scans and it's clear that the baby we thought was so real and would be with us next year was just a phantom. There is nothing in the gestational sac.

I'll be going back to the doctor in 7 days and if I haven't naturally miscarried by then the doctor recommends either a medical miscarriage or a D&C (either vacuum suction or the traditional kind).

All I want is for this situation to go away. I want to get back to normal and ttc again. I want to be pregnant again. I've had no cramping, spotting, nothing, so I don't think this is going to happen naturally for me. Does anyone know which of the medical/surgical options would allow me to achieve closure the quickest? Is there a difference in how quickly my cycle is likely to go back to normal with each option? I'm scared by what I've read about the medical option, it sounds traumatic, but I'm scared that a D&C will harm my fertility. I can't bear having to make this decision.

Meanwhile, my sister gave birth to a gorgeous baby boy just three days before I found out about my blighted ovum. Our family message thread is a constant stream of baby pictures and baby talk. I am so happy for her and overjoyed to have a nephew but I don't know how I can possibly tell her about this. She didn't know I was pregnant. I was so thrilled that our kids would be so close in age and would be in the same school year. I loved that they would be cousins together. I have December gatherings in the diary when I was going to tell my sisters, my friends, my wider family. All that is down the toilet now.

This is my first pregnancy and I know it's just chance and it just happens but I can't help wondering why it had to happen to me, and on my first pregnancy. I'm scared that I'll never have a child, just keep having miscarriages again and again until I'm too old. I know none of this is rational.

<p>All I want is for this situation to go away. I want to get back to normal and ttc again. I want to be pregnant again. I&#39;ve had no cramping, spotting, nothing, so I don&#39;t think this is going to happen naturally for me. Does anyone know which of the medical/surgical options would allow me to achieve closure the quickest? Is there a difference in how quickly my cycle is likely to go back to normal with each option? I&#39;m scared by what I&#39;ve read about the medical option, it sounds traumatic, but I&#39;m scared that a D&amp;C will harm my fertility. I can&#39;t bear having to make this decision.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, my sister gave birth to a gorgeous baby boy just three days before I found out about my blighted ovum. Our family message thread is a constant stream of baby pictures and baby talk. I am so happy for her and overjoyed to have a nephew but I don&#39;t know how I can possibly tell her about this. She didn&#39;t know I was pregnant. I was so thrilled that our kids would be so close in age and would be in the same school year. I loved that they would be cousins together. I have December gatherings in the diary when I was going to tell my sisters, my friends, my wider family. All that is down the toilet now.</p>

<p>This is my first pregnancy and I know it&#39;s just chance and it just happens but I can&#39;t help wondering why it had to happen to me, and on my first pregnancy. I&#39;m scared that I&#39;ll never have a child, just keep having miscarriages again and again until I&#39;m too old. I know none of this is rational.</p>

<p>Thank you for reading. I have a lot of turmoil in my mind and I can&#39;t bring myself to even tell people what has happened.</p>

Was told we should do fertility treatment, and at the time, couldn’t afford it because I didn’t have a job. Fast forward to May and I took Clomid for the first time. Well, after taking my dose, was having weird symptoms so I decided to take an HPT and BAM. Big fat positive with my first ever pregnancy. Bawled my eyes out, freaking out over the phone with the nurse because clomid is category x for pregnant women. Did blood tests, My HCG levels were rising normally though, and I was having normal pregnancy symptoms and all that. Well, a week later, I started to cramp really badly and had some bright red spotting. Off to the ER we go. Come to find out, my pregnancy was ectopic and I went into surgery that very night. 

So fast forward to now. I took my second dose of clomid this month. I feel like an idiot because I got my hopes up over the last few days because I wasn’t having any signs of my period except for mild cramping and some brown spotting, which I had hoped was implantation. Hubby and I decided to get a little busy this morning and guess what? AF shows up DURING and I’m fucking devastated. Not only did it kill the mood, I started bawling my eyes out, I couldn’t look my husband in the face, I didn’t even want him to touch me. 

This has been such a frustrating experience and I’m ready to give up. How am I supposed to feel confident going through these fucking treatments! My husband keeps telling me not to give up, that it’ll happen, that we don’t need the treatments, but month after month my trash can fills up with negative pregnancy tests and AF rears her ugly head. I never thought I would be devastated about getting my period, but it’s EVERY SINGLE MONTH. Does it get any better? Any easier? It’s been 5 months now and it’s still so hard. I don’t even like to see pregnancy announcements or happy pregnant women because I feel so bitter and it’s really sad. It’s not their fault but it doesn’t make it any easier. 😭

Would have been 7w 2d today however last Thursday, 10/25, I MC’d. It happened so fast I was just left in total shock. At about 5pm I went to the bathroom and there was blood. A lot of blood. I got in the shower right after that and ugly cried for about an hour. The bleeding wasn’t stopping. When I got out of the shower I called my OB who told me to go to the ER if the bleeding was heavy or if it didn’t stop within an hour. Hearing that I kinda panicked and called my SIL who is a doctor and she rushed over to check on me. When she was on her way I passed a really big blood clot. When she arrived, she looked through what I passed and found the entire placenta perfectly in-tact. I had already accepted this as a fact once everything started but it still sucked. And my god there was so much blood. Her doctorly way of talking me through everything held me together and I got through the night with the help of some hot chocolate, popcorn, pizza and a silly movie. 

When I went to my OB the next morning they did a pelvic exam, ultrasound and blood work. I guess there was still some blood clots I needed to pass so she prescribed me something to induce labor to push the rest out and I was ordered on bed rest thru 10/30. Right now I’m hanging out on the couch while the drugs do their thing. Hopefully I pass everything and no infections occur. 

The plan is to monitor my hormone levels and make sure they go back to normal and then try again as soon as my body is able. 

After the initial shock and crying I’m feeling much better. If I can find a silver lining it’s that this all happened so early. I know what I was carrying wasn’t viable and I know it happens to a lot of women so I’m not alone. It sucks but I’m not going to dwell on it and let it get me down.
