*If the different journeys caused distance or a temporary strain on the relationship, were you able to successfully circle back and continue your friendship later on?

____
I have suffered multiple miscarriages. I have good days, bad days, and my grief comes in waves.

It’s hard for me when my pregnant best friend reaches out to talk about her pregnancy. I know she’s on a high and just wants to talk about her experience, so I let the attention stay on her and let her have a rambling session. A lot of the time she’s just venting or complaining about what’s uncomfortable or what symptom she’s having to deal with. In my head I’m thinking, at least your baby is alive and you will deliver it. At least you didn’t lose your baby like me over and over. On the other hand, I realize that this is her experience and her feelings are valid (just as mine are with my feelings of my miscarriages) and just because we’re experiencing different things doesn’t mean one is wrong or right or justified or not. Long story short, I always respond with brief positive comments to make her feel better or whatever she’s needing.

This friend knows I’ve been struggling with grief or depression, whatever you want to call it, due to my miscarriages. I spend hours avoiding responding to her texts because it just hurts thinking about what could’ve been - we were pregnant at the same time, I miscarried, she’s due this week. She knows it’s weird for me to not respond immediately, but since my miscarriages this has become the norm. (Side note: She has reminded me a million times that 5 of her other friends are pregnant or have just given birth recently, so how awesome it is that they’re all going through this together and the kids can grow up and play together. Then why not vent to them?! Why not talk about happy stuff with them?! People who can relate. Because I can’t.)

Today she texts me to vent and talking about possibly having to be induced this week if the baby isn’t here by *X* date, then a bunch of other things which I don’t even know how to respond to. It’s basically just talking about herself and the cue is that I need to make her feel better. The cherry on top is that my period started today, when I’ve been secretly thinking for the past week and a half that I’m pregnant and believed that I was experiencing certain pregnancy symptoms. Nope, got my hopes up for nothing. A few days ago, my SIL announced that she’s pregnant. All of these things happening, yet our conversations lately are all about her. Again, I understand where she’s coming from (excited and in your own zone/world) but on the other hand sometimes the one-sidedness is annoying.

I guess I’ve been thinking - my grief made me shut down and be less there for her during her happy time of pregnancy. I could’ve been a better friend, there’s no doubt. I have some guilt there. I wish I could’ve done more. It wasn’t what I imagined due to the pandemic and quarantine, but I could’ve been there for her more emotionally and whatnot. I could’ve reached out more (and initiated more) instead of being overcome with my own grief and depression. I could have sucked it up and just put my own feelings aside, even if it hurt. Maybe I created the wedge in our relationship and it’s my own fault we’re here - I didn’t want to be a downer and be a burden on her with my sadness. Maybe I could’ve initiated the conversation more instead of waiting for her.

Yet at the same time, she could’ve been a better friend to me as well during my miscarriages. She could’ve responded better when I told her my boundaries or sensitivities, actually respected my requests or if she couldn’t have maybe just kept her distance. When I told her I’m feeling literally depressed after the last miscarriage and think I need to talk to a therapist, maybe she could’ve acknowledged it afterward (or at all) or asked how I’m doing weeks later instead of every text being about her and her life only.

But on the other hand, I understand that no one understands miscarriage unless you’ve gone through it yourself. So maybe I’m being too hard on her, and yes when I’m pregnant (hopefully) I’m sure I’ll be self involved as well. These are my thoughts. You can clearly see the back and forth struggle I have in my head about this friendship.

I think we both navigated our experiences poorly, but it is what it is. It’s in the past, and we’re here now. We both could’ve done better, for sure. But, if I don’t change anything now then I think it won’t ever change and it will just get worse (maybe past a point of return).

I’m realizing that my friendship is evolving and is going to change with this friend. I think once her baby is here, she’ll be even more busy and we won’t be like we used to be (even if/when I have a baby later - fingers crossed). I honestly don’t think we’ll even see each other - she wasn’t the best at making time for me in person pre-pregnancy and with a baby it’ll only get worse or non-existent.

But the reason for my post is - have any of you been in a similar situation and *regretted not doing more or trying harder to salvage your friendships with your pregnant friends or friends who are parents*?

She’s one of my longest friendships I’ve ever had (since childhood), so I would be sad if we drifted away from each other now. Yet, on the other hand I understand that life happens and friendships change. And maybe I’ll make even closer friends during this stage of my life (trying to conceive) and the next (hopefully with other parents when I’m pregnant).

I guess I’m curious to hear about your personal experiences to see if I’ll be okay or if it’s the kick in the butt that I need to try to do more (even though it takes effort from both sides).",t2_2i3gu1x7,False,,0,False,Maintaining Strong Friendships with Pregnant Friends,[],r/ttcafterloss,False,0,vent,0,,,False,t3_hqt6s5,False,dark,1.0,,public,4,0,{},,,False,[],,False,False,,{},Vent,False,4,,False,self,1594732973.0,,[],{},,True,,1594722659.0,text,0,,,text,self.ttcafterloss,True,"<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=""md""><p><em>TL;DR:</em></p>

I am grateful for my body and how it handles the unknown. I’m proud of myself for making it this far &amp; for being ok after something so devastating. </p>

<p>I’m stronger than I ever thought possible. I am more resilient and this is one more hard thing that I’ve been through. There will more be hard times in life and that’s a guarantee— but at least I know I can get through anything. </p>

<p>I feel grateful for the experience that has made me a more mindful and compassionate person. I have found peace in the devastation and will continue to grow. </p>

<p>On to the next chance— With a separate batch of sperm, eggs and embryos. We will try again, and I’m grateful for the chance to do that.</p>

At the beginning of this year I was happier with my body than I’ve ever been. My relationship with it has always been fragile, even in the best of times— but I was feeling stronger, happier, and more at home in my skin than I ever had. I got pregnant right away when we tried in April.

27,2048,confidence,<praw.reddit.Reddit object at 0x7f12a630cd90>,,ttcafterloss,"Hi all you brave women.

I think one of the things that is scariest after a loss is knowing whether everything is OK again physically.  I hate that everything is internal and so it's not like I can just whip out my uterus/ovaries and examine them.

In my country, you are also a bit abandoned after they have done the minimum to make sure you're alright, so I'd love to know if anyone else has any other advice that can maybe help other women in knowing that their recovery is going well.

Here are my contributions:

* **Do you feel \*physically\* well in yourself?**  Going through this horrible event definitely knocks you for six, and regardless of how you choose to manage your loss (expectant, medical or surgical) it is very normal to feel extremely drained, weak, and tired in the aftermath - your body has been through a lot!  This should pass, and you will be able to resume your usual exercise routine when it feels right for you.  If you weren't exercising before your loss, it might be worth considering taking up some sort of gentle activity now - walking is a wonderful choice.  If - after the advised recovery time for your procedure has passed - you still feel extremely fatigued or just generally unwell/not right, please seek advice from your medical professional.  Remember that your emotional recovery can have an impact on your body too.
* **Has your period resumed?**  Your menstrual cycle should return approximately 4-6w after your loss 'event' which is marked as CD 1.  It is also completely normal for your period to come back a little earlier, or a lot later (up to 8w or longer) than this, but you may wish to seek advice from a medical professional if your period has not returned after 8w and you are not actively TTC.
* **Have your periods been 'normal' for you?**  Everyone knows their period and the amount of blood they can expect to lose over however long a duration.  If you find that this has changed significantly after your loss and continues after your first period (for which it is normal to be generally heavier, or just a bit out of the ordinary), you may wish to seek advice from a medical professional, especially if you are experiencing reduced blood loss and increased pain.
* **Are your cycles 'regular' for you?**  It is normal for there to be some changes to your cycle immediately after a loss, but it should resume some sort of regularity after a couple of months.  If you are experiencing very short/long/unpredictable/painful periods after your loss, and this was not normal for you before, you may wish to seek advice from a medical professional. NB. Unpredictable or excessively painful periods *before* a loss may be an indicator of another condition, so please get yourself checked out if you haven't!
* **Does it appear that you are ovulating?**  You can confirm ovulation is pending/happened by a number of methods, including using OPKs and tracking your temperature/RHR.  Some women may also experience physical symptoms that herald their ovulation.  NB. A one-off anovulatory cycle immediately after your loss or in the months after is also very normal, as this is a phenomenon which can happen to women not TTC as well.  If you are regularly experiencing anovulatory cycles (as in, more than one or two in 12 cycles/months) you should seek advice from a medical professional.

If you answered 'yes' to all these questions, that's wonderful!  Again, always seek advice from your medical professional if you have any concerns about your health or fertility, but all signs would point to you having recovered well physically after your loss.

Although it can be *very, very* frustrating, it is **normal** for it to take up to 12 months to fall pregnant.  Getting a positive is mainly a huge crapshoot (with some very small variables around age) but you can 'max your stats' each cycle by you and your partner staying healthy, and most importantly, **timing intercourse effectively in your FW**.

Please be aware of when you can get professional help for TTC - this will differ depending on the country you live in and its healthcare system, your age, and whether (if this applies) you wish to go public or private.

I’m at the point where I just want to give up and not try anymore. I’m so fed up and frustrated.

I’ve had one successful pregnancy and 2 miscarriages. I have a beautiful son. My pregnancy with him was difficult. I bled everyday, and had to be on bed rest.

-Has anyone found success in the very first cycle/did you just use around your ovulation date to date your pregnancy? 

-If I have “high fertility” on CB and ewcm, is this enough of a sign of ovulation? (I’m terrible at temping and my strips are all over the place) I’m going to keep testing for peak as I still got high this morning on the digital, but I do not have as much cm anymore.

It stung because I’ve had multiple miscarriages.
The only people who know includes my husband, my parents, and one of my best friends. I put on a brave face when my brother and SIL made their announcement, but I later retreated to a bedroom and broke down. My parents and husband comforted me in private.

After the announcement, we had a family dinner. SIL was telling everyone what she can and cannot eat during her pregnancy. She listed raw seafood and caffeine as a few examples.

My husband is constantly making jokes and making everyone laugh. My dad didn’t catch the entire list SIL was giving, so he asked for her to repeat the last few. My husband jumped in and said, “*No raw seafood, caffeine, COCAINE*.”

The entire room went quiet while we all stared at each other, then everyone busted out laughing. My dad said, “*What*?!” My husband then replied, “*CO-CAINEEE, it’s not good for babies, Mr. X*.” The way he was saying everything was hilarious - speaking slowly to enunciate the word cocaine and making his eyes huge and bulging out, and he was shouting everything like my dad was across the room when he wasn’t. 🗣😂

It felt so good to laugh that hard. It felt so good to have a light hearted moment after breaking down earlier. I think it made my parents happy to see me smile and laugh after being so upset and having to comfort me earlier. I was super emotional earlier and saying stuff like, *when will I have a baby, why couldn’t my babies live and be healthy, it’s not fair, etc*.

I’m so happy and grateful that I have my husband, during happy times and sad times. I’m so happy that he’s close with my parents, and we are comfortable to share our struggles/secrets like our past miscarriages. I’m so happy that they are supportive and don’t give timeline pressure like other people.

Most days, I get waves of being angry and sad. But today, I feel happy and grateful. I thought about the joke from dinner randomly today and started laughing by myself. To everyone reading - I hope you have moments where you laugh so hard that it hurts and it’s a reminder that there are good days ahead.

84,2048,confidence,<praw.reddit.Reddit object at 0x7f12a630cd90>,,ttcafterloss," Hey all, I just need this out of my head and into the world. 

We learned we were expecting about a week before my office sent us all home, and two weeks before my state started lockdown measures. We said at the time ""thank goodness we conceived before the pandemic, can you imagine how much more difficult it would be to make that choice during it?"" It's extraordinarily ironic, in retrospect. 

At no point while I was carrying did I have normal OB/pregnancy experiences. We distanced very early because we had no idea what COVID would be like for pregnant women. I basically didn't leave the house for weeks. I went to all my sonograms alone - the good ones, and the very bad ones. Everything my husband learned - very good, and very bad - was over an unstable Facetime connection. I completely soaked the mask I was wearing at the appointment where the MMC was Dx'ed, because I wasn't allowed to take it off. I had to go to the OR, alone. I kissed my husband goodbye through a cloth mask covering as he dropped me off at the hospital because we didn't really realize what the point of no return for me was. Nobody can come visit us. There are no casseroles from people who care about us.

There's no going out to a bar and forgetting. There's no baseball. 

During the D&C, the doc notices what could be a polyp that needs to get checked out. It started me on this - hopefully no more than - five month medical journey before I can even think about TTC again. Every visit I have to deal with this, I'm alone, and I'm obsessively slathering my hands in sanitizer. I, frankly, have no idea what my OB's face looks like, apart from having seen her photo on the office website. I couldn't pick her PA out of a line-up. I'm told that they're sending me for a hysteroscopic myomectomy in order to finally be green-lit to TTC again, but I can't do that until I get tested for COVID and proven to be negative. 

Right now, I'm really struggling with feeling disconnected from my physical self. I don't feel beautiful, or desireable. Real intimacy, not just some desperate desire to have sex in order to conceive again, feels like a million years away. And all the stuff I would have turned to, all the suggestions for ""post-MC self care"" I find online - none of that is an option now. Even though, technically, yes, I can go to a salon and invest in a new hairstyle, I can hardly make it through my 45 minute medical visits with professionals who know about COVID safety measures without feeling insane anxiety. No way three hours with a stranger touching my head is going to work out, for me. I tried dying my hair at home instead. It didn't work.

This is my second cycle after my April 16th miscarriage.  Last month, I had a small amount of bleeding all the way up until mid-cycle. It didn't look like I was going to ovulate and then I had a small LH spike at CD 15.. I don't think I ovulated though looking back, the test doesn't quite look positive.

This month, I'm on CD 14 today and it looks like my LH levels are actually going down rather than up.  I again have some bleeding/spotting at this point in my cycle.

I had an US a week and a half ago to see if I had fibroids (doctor found what he thought to be a fibroid right before my MC), no fibroids happily, but I do have a complex ovarian cyst. My SIL who is an OB tells me that if a cyst is found early in the cycle (my US was on day 3), it likely means the previous cycle was anovulatory, as cysts usually burst before the cycle re-starts.

I have also read that bleeding through a cycle can be a symptom of not ovulating.  

Pretty bummed if I'm not ovulating as I was excited to start TTC again this month.

I go into see my doctor at the beginning of next month to see if the cyst is still there. I guess I'll ask her about the bleeding and not ovulating at that point... 

Wondering if anyone has experienced bleeding through their cycles, well after the point when their period has stopped... and if there was any correlation with not ovulating.

I'm 35, my husband and I decided to TTC last July, but in August I had a DVT and Pulmonary Embolism and we had to wait for 6 months while I recovered from that, so I'm also on blood thinners for the rest of my life due to that.

Anyway, on March 23 I found out I was pregnant (yay!) but on April 14 I started miscarrying. TL;DR: Blighted ovum and I had a D&C on May 8.

My doctor said it would be okay to try after I have a ""normal"" period. And I tracked assuming that the D&C was the period and went from there. When I was due for my period (day 28) I had one day of bleeding and that was it. That's extremely atypical as mine usually last 4-5 days at least.

Despite that, we decided to track if I was ovulating at least, and the pee sticks said I was ovulating on June 23. I started testing at 8dpo (probably way too early but I was really anxious) and it's been nothing nothing nothing.

This past week I have been sick! Nausea, dizziness, this is way more than I felt with the MC before, and I'm right on the cusp of late (this is day 30). I had some spotting on day 28, but nothing that I would call a period at all, it was even less than the weird period I had immediately following the D&C.

My ex-husband and I tried for three years to get pregnant. After much testing, I was diagnosed with ""unexplained infertility"". With medical assistance, we finally succeeded in conceiving in early 2016, by which point the stress of TTC (among other things) had seriously impacted our marriage. I miscarried at 6 weeks. It was a traumatic experience for me, in part due to a pre-existing medical phobia, and I struggled to recover. My body felt alien to me, as if it had been transformed into a graveyard, and I hated myself. My ex-husband tried, but couldn't understand, and was unable to grieve with me. Our marriage fell the rest of the way apart and we decided to divorce. I went to therapy, learned better coping skills, and processed a lot of things I didn't know I needed to work out. I resigned myself to the idea of not having children of my own.

Fast-forward to now: I've recently married a wonderful man with whom I would be delighted to start a family, but...infertility. And I'm terrified that I'll have another miscarriage. On the other hand, I do want to have a baby with him, and I'm really happy that he's excited about the possibility. Right now we've agreed to just not prevent a pregnancy and see what happens, but I'm still afraid to get my hopes up and afraid to be disappointed. I've tried to communicate all of this to him, but it still feels like he's...really unrealistically optimistic about our odds. I don't want to kill his excitement, but I also don't want him to be totally unprepared if I do get pregnant and miscarry, or if I can't get pregnant at all. He says that he's okay whether it happens or not, but there are things nobody can predict, and I feel like this is one of those situations where you don't know how you'll react until you're in it.

I feel like I'm stuck between a rock and a hard place.

For those of you who don't know, I have recently gone through a miscarriage and what I finally confirmed today to be a chemical pregnancy. I saw my doctor today. He and his resident were super nice, talked through everything with me, had an appropriate and appreciated joke. (Will share at the end.) We have a plan, the plan is to wait a cycle or two and try again. He explained his reasoning for not being more aggressive with testing and I agree with him 100%. It's not worth my mental health - yet. 

The however comes from this damn medical assistant. She's the one who on the phone when I explained the timeline of loss, negatives, then positives, said that it doesn't make sense and I should just come in. Well I see her and she's weighing me and she asks me how many weeks I am. Dumb question, but after I told her zero weeks, she read the chart. When she was taking notes for before the doctor comes in, she kept going on about how it might be a ghost pregnancy and my body playing tricks on me because sometimes it does it. She says it's common and she sees it a lot. 

I almost lost my cool. What I wanted to say while thinking about it in my car is, ""I'm a mental health professional, are you implying this is in my head?"" 

What I did was say nothing. I am so mad with this lady. Everyone else there has been amazing and I like this practice because it's in network and affiliated with the hospital network I work for, so I pay nothing for anything. If I give birth at a hospital in the network, I pay 100$ or something stupid. Everyone else has been super nice and supportive, and the doctor even apologized when I said I felt like I had to track things myself for a while when I waited a long time to hear back. I get treated like royalty because im an employee and I have been happy - except for ms paranormal expert here. 

I don't know what to do. We're preparing for our future of trying again, but I don't want her involved in it. I'm very sensitive to my experience being dismissed because this hurt more than I expected. It disrupted my life more than I expected. I know everyone says they ""hope it sticks"" but I was not prepared for the ""not sticking"" part. 

Ugh. That's my TED talk. 

Anyways, I told my doctor I had no idea what I am doing or what I should do moving forward.

Some background: I have had two miscarriages, the latest which came after the pregnancy was confirmed viable with a strong heartbeat during my first ultrasound (miscarried at almost 11 weeks). I was referred to a RE and he ran all of the tests you could think of. We finally got our results and the only thing he could point to as being an issue is luteal stage deficiency, where my progesterone was low during that phase in my cycle. He has prescribed progesterone suppositories. I couldn't find an appropriate subreddit for questions about prescription medication, The ones that seem like the right places have rules against asking about prescription medications. So here's the issue I am having trouble with (apologies in advance for the long story).

I was prescribed progesterone suppositories and the most affordable option was a mail-only pharmacy. The pharmacist on the phone told me to be careful to keep the suppositories at room temperature, nothing over 80 degrees, otherwise they will melt. The rep who took my order over the phone last week said they would ship the medications out today (Monday) and I paid for expedited shipping so they would arrive at my home by Wednesday.

Well, I checked the tracking information and apparently they shipped it on Friday night and the package spent the entire weekend (48+ hours) in a UPS warehouse in a city in the south where temperatures climb over 99 degrees Fahrenheit daily. I checked the UPS website and they do not have climate controlled warehouses. 

I called the pharmacy and spoke with a pharmacist. She basically confirmed that they do not ship the suppositories in cold packaging, and she said that the encasing material of the suppositories would start to melt at between 91-115 degrees Fahrenheit. She conceded that they should have waited to ship out today instead of letting the package languish in a warehouse over the holiday weekend, but didn't offer me a replacement. She said if they arrive melted (ETA is tomorrow, Tuesday), to send a picture to their quality control group. She didn't confirm nor deny anything side from saying she wouldn't have shipped them on Friday, basically admitting a mistake on their end. But she didn't go as far as offering a replacement. 

My concern is drug efficacy. Even if they're not fully melted, or if I can salvage them by putting them in the fridge (pharmacist's suggestion), can I safely use them? Or would the quality be compromised by the exposure to extreme heat already? Would you trust this medication enough to use it? This is quite literally a life and death question for me.

If anyone here has dealt with similar situations I would very much appreciate your input, especially if you've been told something about this by your doctor. I called my doctor's office but he had already left for the day and the RN wasn't very helpful. I'm also concerned about timing, I would need to order a replacement sooner rather than later if I'm going to be able to try this cycle.

I wanted to post to see if anyone had this kind of situation (or similar) and found any explanation for repeat losses. I have had 3 losses around the same time (8-9 weeks) and my doctor said she would recommend aspirin and progesterone next pregnancy, but I’m wondering if I should get an opinion of an RE as well to avoid another loss. 

Here’s the timeline and some details:

- 1st pregnancy: Ultrasound at 8 weeks showed 6w5d measurement with slow heartbeat, miscarried within a week

- 2nd pregnancy (immediately following 1st)- LC

- 3rd pregnancy: Ultrasound at 8w3d showed 5 week measurements and I was already bleeding, miscarried within a couple days

- 4th pregnancy: Ultrasound at 8w6d showed 8w measurements with no heartbeat. No bleeding or signs yet, but confirmed miscarriage.

My question is- what kind of condition would present so similarly three times, but with an LC in the middle? I’m not sure what significant interventions like IVF we would pursue regardless of results (difference of opinion - I would probably want to pursue but my partner probably would not want to.)

It seems like it’s not just bad luck with such similar timelines. Has anyone else experienced similar and found any causes?

<p>I wanted to post to see if anyone had this kind of situation (or similar) and found any explanation for repeat losses. I have had 3 losses around the same time (8-9 weeks) and my doctor said she would recommend aspirin and progesterone next pregnancy, but I’m wondering if I should get an opinion of an RE as well to avoid another loss. </p>

<p>Here’s the timeline and some details:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>1st pregnancy: Ultrasound at 8 weeks showed 6w5d measurement with slow heartbeat, miscarried within a week</p></li>
<li><p>2nd pregnancy (immediately following 1st)- LC</p></li>
<li><p>3rd pregnancy: Ultrasound at 8w3d showed 5 week measurements and I was already bleeding, miscarried within a couple days</p></li>
<li><p>4th pregnancy: Ultrasound at 8w6d showed 8w measurements with no heartbeat. No bleeding or signs yet, but confirmed miscarriage.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>My question is- what kind of condition would present so similarly three times, but with an LC in the middle? I’m not sure what significant interventions like IVF we would pursue regardless of results (difference of opinion - I would probably want to pursue but my partner probably would not want to.)</p>

I am weary about coming on here to get advice but knowing that others may be in the same boat or have gone through similar circumstances makes me feel slightly better.

I am 32 and have PCOS. I have had two losses since last October. I lost my first baby at 14 weeks and had a d&c. It was beyond traumatic especially when it came out of nowhere (missed miscarriage)and after seeing the baby move it's arms about and seeing their face profile...I felt like death. thankfully I was in therapy at the time and with help I tried again in January, but 7.5 weeks in they found it had stopped growing earlier on- I had my second missed miscarriage. 

My second baby would have had an October due date. Well a month after my miscarriage my sister tells me she is pregnant and due in October with a healthy baby. I am older than her and apparently she only tried twice according to her. I was gutted and wanted to be swallowed by the earth. I have been trying for 6 years and it came so easily for her. Ok enough pity party there.....so now with slightly some info about my journey, I want to move forward and try for another baby. They wanted to send the tissue from both pregnancies to a lab for genetics- this was in February. Covid hit and then my fertility office closed. I was scared anyway about the world so I didn't ask. Then they opened up in April and asked again if they could send the samples, I said yes. They came back saying they needed more of the tissue a few weeks later and now we are in July and according to my nurse, the genetic company is not communicating with them. I am left with no answers after all these months. I have had loads of blood tests on me to check other issues off the list- thankfully nothing. 

Now I want to keep going, frustrated by no answers and scared about the future as it is. I asked if I could try with ovidril this month and they said yes. I might be setting my self up for another miscarriage but maybe not either. They keep saying it could have been two flukes. The genetics can come back and say ivf or try normal again. I don't know! 

I want to also quit my job as a teacher because if I do get pregnant, I don't want to potentially get sick, lose my baby or my life. I know that is dramatic but I feel like everything is a crapshoot at this point. I could afford to live off my husband's income, it would be tight but doable. Am I crazy for thinking this? I just want a child so bad that I want every opportunity to have one. Life is so fleeting and unpredictable. Part of this decision comes from my husband also coming extremely close to death last January. That was a wake-up call on both of us. Am I jumping too far to loose my job and maybe another baby. I just wouldn't want to wait another year until next summer to try once again.

After two early miscarriages back to back, my husband and I conceived our beautiful baby daughter shortly after. She is now 14 months, and I am so grateful and take nothing for granted with her. 

Due to some recent dull pelvic panic, I went to my OBGYN, and they did a pap smear,  pelvic exam and an ultrasound to make sure all is well, and thank God, all is well! They found nothing, but while I was there I brought up trying to conceive again. 

To provide some context, I currently have a Nexplanon implant in, and I’ll be 35 in February and as I said, I had two back to back miscarriages (first at 6 weeks, second at 5 weeks). 

I keep going back and forth on when to get off BC, and start actively trying. I love the rhythm us 3 have and kinda want my daughter to be the only baby and have attention on her for a while longer, financially it would be more difficult (my husband and I both work) and with COVID, so much is in the air, I have a tendency to make quick decisions and not sit and think on them. On the other hand though, due to miscarriage past, I’m afraid my chances to miscarry are higher, I’ll be 35 soon, we do want another child, and I’m afraid if I wait longer I may run into more problems with trying to conceive or my hopeful pregnancy. 

I have an appointment to get my BC removed in September, even though my husband suggests waiting to actively try until maybe later in the year or early next year, but I feel at this point in time every month counts. 

I’m so conflicted! You read articles that say so many women are having babies in their mid to late 30s, and everything is fine, but then I think of my past, and I get scared. 

Should I take my BC out earlier? Trust my body? I got pregnant 3 months in a row when trying to conceive, so perhaps I’m more fertile than I think? Albeit, first two were unsuccessful.

After a miscarriage in January, my fiancé and I took a break from TTC but had a deep conversation this past weekend and decided we finally wanted to start trying again. I have PCOS, so I was wondering if anyone else who has it has more specific advice, but any other advice is helpful too. What are some of your best suggestions on books to read, precautions to take, supplements/lifestyle changes etc. I also have my annual next month, so if there’s anything you think I should talk to my doctor about/tests I should ask to run, those suggestions are also welcome! After the loss, I want to do everything possible to be as healthy as I can + I’m extremely nervous.

After a miscarriage in January, my fiancé and I took a break from TTC but had a deep conversation this past weekend and decided we finally wanted to start trying again.

What are some of your best suggestions on books to read, precautions to take, supplements/lifestyle changes etc. I also have my annual next month, so if there’s anything you think I should talk to my doctor about/tests I should ask to run, those suggestions are also welcome!

Last night, my brother’s wife (SIL) announced that she’s 8 weeks pregnant.

My best friend since childhood is currently pregnant and due later this month. She also announced early at 8 weeks.

I would’ve been due in early September. I could’ve been pregnant at the same time as both of them, if I didn’t lose my baby.

I’m angry that I had to wait after the 8 week mark to even consider announcing, but they both were able to announce earlier yet have healthy pregnancies. It’s unfair.

I’m angry that I made a daily effort to eat healthier and exercise before trying to get pregnant (not that I had to because I was already a healthy BMI but I was doing everything possible to try to make the healthiest baby I could), yet one got pregnant during her first month trying.

I tried to do everything the right and safe way, yet I suffer and others get rewarded. It’s unfair.

I’m angry that my brother and SIL have a toxic verbally and physically abusive relationship (both are to each other), but they’re pregnant now. But not me and my husband, who have been married forever and trying for what seems like forever and we’re actually stable. Not us, who treat our dog like our practice baby and our entire world and spoil her with so much love. Not us, who desperately want a baby but keep getting disappointed.

I’m angry that people, especially awful people, can easily become pregnant while people like me who have a stable healthy relationship have to suffer.

There are bad people in this world, unfit parents, parents who abandon their kids, parents who are verbally or physically abusive, etc. We would take such good care of a little baby, if we got the chance to be parents.

I’m just angry and jealous, to be honest. I’m usually not one to compare timelines, but after last night’s announcement that’s what I’m guilty of and it’s breaking me. I usually try to stay positive, but fuck all of that today. I just needed to let it all out.
_______
*EDIT*: Immediately after announcing, my brother and SIL told not asked me that their doctor would be contacting me with the gender info in a few weeks. I will be the first and only one to know, and I’ll need to help plan the gender reveal party. I do not speak with or have a relationship with these people. I see them maybe 2-3 times a year at my parents’ house for holiday gatherings and birthdays. I don’t go out of my way to speak to them at these yearly family gatherings, only give short responses when they try to chat me up. Why not ask someone they are close to, in contact with, have a relationship with, and are genuinely nice to? That’s not me. They can ask their millions of friends who they wear a mask in front of (no one will know their true selves or learn the facade they put on in public), or how about her MULTIPLE SISTERS the SIL has? They are both verbally abusive to me (I’ve learned it’s a power and control thing because they do it even when I’ve done nothing wrong and they intentionally don’t target other people because they know they won’t get away with it), and at times they’ve been physically abusive to get their way. I don’t want to help them, but I don’t want to tell them the reason why (and it’s none of their business). Frankly, it’s because they’re abusive assholes to me, I don’t owe them anything, and it’s a painful reminder for the few babies I’ve lost.

I’m frustrated because my follow up appointment was useless. He told me to wait three cycles or longer before trying again (yeah, no thanks). And he offered to no help or suggestion to find out why it might of happened. He just said “it’s common, there’s nothing anyone can do and no explanation”. My office doesn’t do betas and test for HCG which is also frustrating. There are plenty of Nurse practitioners, midwives and even a doctor I love at my office but I keep getting stuck with this horrible doctor because of the urgency of the situation. (No wonder he’s the only one available he is so awkward and doesn’t care). 

So Thanks to all of these amazing subreddits ive taken some pregnancy tests and finally had it come back negative which is one glimmer of hope because I know it can take a while for some. 

I’ve done a lot of deep diving into why this might have happened, I’ve never had so much blood drawn in my life. I just came back positive for two markers of Lymes disease. From my research it seems the lymes could be an explanation for my loss. 

Now that I’ve gotten the negative test I so badly want to just try again but I know I need to take care of the lymes and my teeth first. 

We finally tried to have sex again and I burst out crying in the middle of it and couldn’t keep it together. I thought I was ready but I guess not. 

And now that it’s finally becoming time to try again I’m paralyzed with the fear that I will have another MMC and another D&C I can’t afford. And that my boss will be mad (she won’t but I can’t stop thinking it) because I’ll need more time off for another surgery I caused by trying again. 

So overall it’s been a freaking rollercoaster trying to get back to ttc and I am just grateful for these subs so I don’t have to feel so alone and I feel educated. Because otherwise the system sucks and I would know nothing.

However, that CP is not clinically confirmed. When I scheduled a doctors appointment for a urine test to confirm pregnancy and start prenatal care, the clinic’s test resulted negative. I was given the option of drawing blood or waiting a week to retest at the clinic. I opted for blood tests. However, due to covid, I had to wait nearly a week to get blood tests done. In that week, I passed everything naturally and the result was my AF being only 6 days late. I was told at the clinic that my blood results were negative, which I expected because by the time I went to get blood drawn AF had started a couple days before. My HCG levels then were <3. The clinic has now seen this as a delayed period and not an early miscarriage, even though I told them I had multiple hpt with very visible positive lines and digital hpts that confirmed those line tests. Now I am terrified about having more CPs or other fertility issues.

To mention** I’ve had battles on & off with yeast & bv prior to and during/after pregnancy & miscarriage. This may affect your responses.

I miscarried naturallly at home over a month ago, (almost at 2 months now). I had a yeast infection all throughout my pregnancy as well as some other vaginal issues (bv& irritation) that I took medications for but I can’t say these issues went away as I have yet to feel completely right down there. 

After my miscarriage, I went to the doc where they confirmed my body naturally expelled everything.

Fast forward to now, post-miscarriage, after sex I’d occasionally have strange discharge (like mauve-y tinged with blood) but it was so light that I assumed it was normal because I’ve read you can spot or bleed after sex post-miscarriage.

The day before my first period I had sex. After sex I had a sharp sharp SHARP pain in my lower abdomen, it felt like my left ovary had been bludgeoned. I assumed this was due to a cyst, which I know I have from time to time but they generally cause no pain and disappear on their own. Or that it was just a horrid period cramp. It was awful. Although the pain was excruciating I ignored it and just a a few hours later the pain totally subsided and I got my period. It was the worst period I’ve ever had in terms of flow & emotions, but I also know post miscarriage periods can be a lot rougher on the body.

It has now been almost a week and a half since the final day of my first post-miscarriage period, and since then I’ve had sex (once unprotected, then protected) twice in a row with my bf. I had sex last night and again this morning. The sex was not painful and actually felt quite good. I was lubricated and there wasn’t much friction. I had light bleeding last night, I tried again this morning with a condom to see if there would be a difference, but there wasn’t. the bleeding hasn’t stopped. It’s not a lot, and it’s not bright red (more pink/orange), but I’m not having any “normal” discharge. All my discharge is this bloody pink color. Every time I wipe, I see pink. My vagina also feels slightly irritated (most likely due to aforementioned problems) but I’m sure this blood is not coming from the skin or a tear. My discharge itself is bloody so I know it’s either internal or from my cervix. Due to covid I can’t get an immediate appointment and this is giving me extreme anxiety. I have to wait at least a week to see someone. 

Has anyone had experiences like this after loss? Getting my first period post miscarriage was traumatic enough, and now I’m just triggered. I keep worrying that maybe I got an infection, or something is wrong with my uterus, or that maybe the yeast and bv was masking something more serious (although I’ve been tested for stds and such always coming up negative) and just all of these paranoid thoughts... I’m even thinking that maybe something is wrong with me and that’s why I miscarried. dealing with this post loss is so difficult especially when there isn’t a plethora of medical advisors available to me right now.

<p>To mention** I’ve had battles on &amp; off with yeast &amp; bv prior to and during/after pregnancy &amp; miscarriage. This may affect your responses.</p>

<p>I miscarried naturallly at home over a month ago, (almost at 2 months now). I had a yeast infection all throughout my pregnancy as well as some other vaginal issues (bv&amp; irritation) that I took medications for but I can’t say these issues went away as I have yet to feel completely right down there. </p>

<p>After my miscarriage, I went to the doc where they confirmed my body naturally expelled everything.</p>

<p>Fast forward to now, post-miscarriage, after sex I’d occasionally have strange discharge (like mauve-y tinged with blood) but it was so light that I assumed it was normal because I’ve read you can spot or bleed after sex post-miscarriage.</p>

<p>The day before my first period I had sex. After sex I had a sharp sharp SHARP pain in my lower abdomen, it felt like my left ovary had been bludgeoned. I assumed this was due to a cyst, which I know I have from time to time but they generally cause no pain and disappear on their own. Or that it was just a horrid period cramp. It was awful. Although the pain was excruciating I ignored it and just a a few hours later the pain totally subsided and I got my period. It was the worst period I’ve ever had in terms of flow &amp; emotions, but I also know post miscarriage periods can be a lot rougher on the body.</p>

<p>It has now been almost a week and a half since the final day of my first post-miscarriage period, and since then I’ve had sex (once unprotected, then protected) twice in a row with my bf. I had sex last night and again this morning. The sex was not painful and actually felt quite good. I was lubricated and there wasn’t much friction. I had light bleeding last night, I tried again this morning with a condom to see if there would be a difference, but there wasn’t. the bleeding hasn’t stopped. It’s not a lot, and it’s not bright red (more pink/orange), but I’m not having any “normal” discharge. All my discharge is this bloody pink color. Every time I wipe, I see pink. My vagina also feels slightly irritated (most likely due to aforementioned problems) but I’m sure this blood is not coming from the skin or a tear. My discharge itself is bloody so I know it’s either internal or from my cervix. Due to covid I can’t get an immediate appointment and this is giving me extreme anxiety. I have to wait at least a week to see someone. </p>

<p>Has anyone had experiences like this after loss? Getting my first period post miscarriage was traumatic enough, and now I’m just triggered. I keep worrying that maybe I got an infection, or something is wrong with my uterus, or that maybe the yeast and bv was masking something more serious (although I’ve been tested for stds and such always coming up negative) and just all of these paranoid thoughts... I’m even thinking that maybe something is wrong with me and that’s why I miscarried. dealing with this post loss is so difficult especially when there isn’t a plethora of medical advisors available to me right now.</p>

<p>Please help if you have had a similar experience, it is greatly appreciated as I have no one to go to for advice.</p>

I had a MMC at 9 weeks 5/21 followed by a D&amp;C 5/28, a month ago. It was obviously not an easy situation. Unfortunately when I found out I was  pregnant I told my close family and the in laws. I also told my 2 best friends. These are all people i am extremely  close with, and when I did have the MMC, it wasn’t the worst thing in the world, because of our tight relationships. Now that a month goes by, and everyone begins to come out of quarantine... my husband hangs out with one of his old (female) friends, which I have no problem with... mind you, I’ve only met her at maximum 3 times in the past 7 years (so to me, she is basically an acquaintance/stranger) and get this... he f*cking tells her that I had a miscarriage “because she brought up one of her friends had one.” So my husband, whom I’m supposed to be able to trust with my personal information, health and secrets, goes and blabs our/my personal information to someone I’ve only met (briefly)3 times my entire life. She is not a best friend of his, which I would be more understanding of. They hang out maybe twice a year and talk maybe every other month. I’m so disgusted and feel betrayed that he would tell my secrets to a stranger (which she is to me). I don’t know how to even proceed with this right now. I threw water in his face and he is currently sleeping on the couch while I’m absolutely LIVID. Any suggestions on how to handle this? Any help is appreciated.</p>

218,2048,confidence,<praw.reddit.Reddit object at 0x7f12a630cd90>,,ttcafterloss,"Hi all, I’ve been lurking here for a few months, and feel it’s time for me to actually ask some questions instead of hopefully search to see if my questions have been posed by others! Apologize in advance for the length.

I am 33, and have had three miscarriages in the last year, they spanned over 8 months. Chemical in October at 32 years old, MMC in March at 32 years old again. I was 8.5 weeks with no heartbeat and measured at 6weeks - medically managed with misoprostyl (actually passed the fetal tissue in the shower on my 33rd birthday), and another chemical in May at 33 years old. The MMC products of conception were karyotyped, and it was a normal 46xx female embryo. We are now working with an RE, who has been a wonderful support. We are also lucky to live in Illinois, where much of fertility treatment is covered by insurance!

I have done the RPL panel - negative for diabetes, anticardiolipin, antiphospholipid, lupus anticoagulant. TSH and T4 are normal, but I am positive for TPO antibodies. I have been put on 25 mg of Synthroid, and my TSH is now 1.9 (it was about 2.3 or so before Synthroid). From what I understand, there is a correlation between having TPO antibodies and RPL, but mixed results in studies on whether taking Synthroid actually helps reduce risk of miscarriage in this population. I did an SIS in April before the third loss and they found a 5mm fibroid within the uterine cavity, although my OB was not concerned. I am getting a myomectomy per my RE's suggestions next week to remove it. All my other blood work is “normal” - day 3 FSH is 9, day 3 estradiol is 33, and AMH is 2.0 (I think this may be on the lower end of normal for 33 years old, but my RE is not worried about it and says it’s normal nonetheless). I am worried about my AFC - it’s somewhere between 6-8, which everywhere I have read says is low. My doctor says it’s on the low end of normal, although she anticipated higher for my age, but I can’t tell if she is assuaging me or not. 

So, I feel completely stuck as to what to do next. We have had no trouble conceiving any of the times we’ve tried, it only takes about 3 months or so to conceive. But clearly none have stuck, but that was also before the Synthroid, removing the fibroid, and progesterone support (which my RE is going to prescribe to me in the luteal phase if we choose to not do IVF and try naturally). We are considering IVF with PGS, but with my AFC I am not convinced it’s the best approach. We also miscarried a chromosomally normal embryo before. I know ultimately it’s about egg quality over quantity, but I’d rather not go through several retrievals. I also feel like maybe it would be best to just keep trying on our own - I’ve read that upwards of 60% of women with RPL will eventually carry to term. I have started to take COQ10, DHEA, fish oil, selenium along with my prenatal, vitamin d3, etc, and trying to avoid plastic and artificial fragrances, as well as attempting to drink less, all in hopes of improving egg quality.

I know no one can make a decision for me, but I am really torn between trying the old fashioned way while I’m still in my “good years”, with the addition of removing the fibroid, having progesterone and Synthroid, or potentially risk losing some of that time to IVF with PGS which also yields no guarantee. We also are not planning on living in IL for much longer, so feel some pressure to use the IVF coverage while we have it, and while my embryos will still be 33, as opposed to changing my mind a few years down the line when I am older and have to pay out of pocket in a different state.

Any thoughts? Success stories?

Thanks so much :)",t2_61q67lnq,False,,0,False,Advice on whether to keep trying naturally or go IVF,[],r/ttcafterloss,False,0,question,0,,,False,t3_hi17bn,False,dark,1.0,,public,12,0,{},,,False,[],,False,False,,{},Question,False,12,,False,self,False,,[],{},,True,,1593470927.0,text,0,,,text,self.ttcafterloss,True,"<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=""md""><p>Hi all, I’ve been lurking here for a few months, and feel it’s time for me to actually ask some questions instead of hopefully search to see if my questions have been posed by others! Apologize in advance for the length.</p>

<p>I am 33, and have had three miscarriages in the last year, they spanned over 8 months. Chemical in October at 32 years old, MMC in March at 32 years old again. I was 8.5 weeks with no heartbeat and measured at 6weeks - medically managed with misoprostyl (actually passed the fetal tissue in the shower on my 33rd birthday), and another chemical in May at 33 years old. The MMC products of conception were karyotyped, and it was a normal 46xx female embryo. We are now working with an RE, who has been a wonderful support. We are also lucky to live in Illinois, where much of fertility treatment is covered by insurance!</p>

<p>I have done the RPL panel - negative for diabetes, anticardiolipin, antiphospholipid, lupus anticoagulant. TSH and T4 are normal, but I am positive for TPO antibodies. I have been put on 25 mg of Synthroid, and my TSH is now 1.9 (it was about 2.3 or so before Synthroid). From what I understand, there is a correlation between having TPO antibodies and RPL, but mixed results in studies on whether taking Synthroid actually helps reduce risk of miscarriage in this population. I did an SIS in April before the third loss and they found a 5mm fibroid within the uterine cavity, although my OB was not concerned. I am getting a myomectomy per my RE&#39;s suggestions next week to remove it. All my other blood work is “normal” - day 3 FSH is 9, day 3 estradiol is 33, and AMH is 2.0 (I think this may be on the lower end of normal for 33 years old, but my RE is not worried about it and says it’s normal nonetheless). I am worried about my AFC - it’s somewhere between 6-8, which everywhere I have read says is low. My doctor says it’s on the low end of normal, although she anticipated higher for my age, but I can’t tell if she is assuaging me or not. </p>

<p>So, I feel completely stuck as to what to do next. We have had no trouble conceiving any of the times we’ve tried, it only takes about 3 months or so to conceive. But clearly none have stuck, but that was also before the Synthroid, removing the fibroid, and progesterone support (which my RE is going to prescribe to me in the luteal phase if we choose to not do IVF and try naturally). We are considering IVF with PGS, but with my AFC I am not convinced it’s the best approach. We also miscarried a chromosomally normal embryo before. I know ultimately it’s about egg quality over quantity, but I’d rather not go through several retrievals. I also feel like maybe it would be best to just keep trying on our own - I’ve read that upwards of 60% of women with RPL will eventually carry to term. I have started to take COQ10, DHEA, fish oil, selenium along with my prenatal, vitamin d3, etc, and trying to avoid plastic and artificial fragrances, as well as attempting to drink less, all in hopes of improving egg quality.</p>

<p>I know no one can make a decision for me, but I am really torn between trying the old fashioned way while I’m still in my “good years”, with the addition of removing the fibroid, having progesterone and Synthroid, or potentially risk losing some of that time to IVF with PGS which also yields no guarantee.

I’m currently experiencing some really frustrating issues with my body while trying to conceive... a little background- back in 2012 I experienced two miscarriages 9 months apart (both within the first trimester), the second being extremely traumatic for me. Fast forward to tail end ‘17 to mid-‘18, I’m trying to convince with my then husband... my body goes into this crazy hormone swing that over the course of 4 months (‘17) I’m experiencing pregnancy symptoms but still getting a regular period and then completely swings to the other side where for 9 months I have no period and no pregnancy and all depression, going to the ob/gyn twice a month every month I don’t have a period (this all started with a false positive). The doctor couldn’t find any reason why I would be experiencing these symptoms- checked for PCOS, estrogen levels, blood count, thyroid, etc.

I’m currently experiencing some really frustrating issues with my body while trying to conceive... a little background- back in 2012 I experienced two miscarriages 9 months apart (both within the first trimester), the second being extremely traumatic for me. Fast forward to tail end ‘17 to mid-‘18, I’m trying to convince with my then husband... my body goes into this crazy hormone swing that over the course of 4 months (‘17) I’m experiencing pregnancy symptoms but still getting a regular period and then completely swings to the other side where for 9 months I have no period and no pregnancy and all depression, going to the ob/gyn twice a month every month I don’t have a period (this all started with a false positive). The doctor couldn’t find any reason why I would be experiencing these symptoms- checked for PCOS, estrogen levels, blood count, thyroid, etc.</p>

<p>We have seen two specialists, had all the tests, had a hysteroscopy on Wednesday, nothing can be identified but they suspect immune issues. They want to put me on clexane and see if it works.</p>

<p>I have this unrelenting horrible feeling but they are going to give me medication that will get me out of the first trimester only to lose it later on. I think I probably have a degree of trauma surrounding this whole thing which im seeing someone for, but it&#39;s making me question whether I can even keep going. My gut says clexane isn&#39;t treating the issue which I suspect is autoimmune, and I really can&#39;t just keep having miscarriages while they try and figure out what works.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t really know what I&#39;m looking for in this post I&#39;m just so depressed and anxious and feel so isolated by this process 😩</p>

We tried to conceive the old fashioned way for 8 months before seeing a specialist. I’m perfectly healthy, all normal numbers, insides etc. Same with DH sperm count motility etc. At month 12 we did our first IUI and it worked! However we soon found out based on my betas and a failed d&c that it was ectopic, and I had the two methotrexate shots.

Then came the 3 month wait for the methotrexate poison to leave the body, which happened to correspond with covid quarantine. Finally our clinic reopened just as I was ending the wait. We did another IUI right away, but due to covid they didn’t do a baseline ultrasound and I just started on clomid, and had an ultrasound before the trigger shot. Unfortunately no luck.

When I went in for my baseline at my next cycle, they discovered 3 cysts, 2 small on my right ovary and a larger on my left. Doctor said it could be left over from the follicles from clomid last cycle and recommended a rest cycle from clomid. My estrogen levels were also high from the cysts. Still tried naturally. During the 2WW was my 33rd birthday, which was sad because it marks yet another year without a child.  

The NEXT DAY my little sister told me she.  was 9 weeks pregnant. I’m happy for her but obviously devastated. She knows about my ectopic And fertility issues so was very sensitive in telling me , which I appreciate, but it still hurts. 

I went in for my next baseline after waiting a cycle yesterday. The smaller cysts disappeared but the larger was still there, and my estrogen was still high. They have no put me on birth control for the next 3 weeks (maybe longer, TBD). I have an ultrasound scheduled 3 weeks from now to see if the bc helped the cyst go away, and if so we will start another clomid cycle and try another IUI.

This will be my 3rd IUI which is the limit my doctor recommends. I’m so sad and frustrated. I don’t know why this isn’t working. I’ve never drank a soda or coffee in my whole life, so no caffeine. I’ve never smoked a cigarette ever. I eat healthy, work out 4-5 days a week, healthy BMI. DH has other kids from a previous marriage so I know he doesn’t have issues. I’m so sad and frustrated and every new pregnancy announcement I see or pregnant belly gets harder.

I have NO IDEA how I’m going to make it through my sister’s pregnancy. Watching her get more and more pregnant every week...I’m going to lose it. She’s due January 11th and I just don’t think I can sit through Christmas with the family if I’m not pregnant. DH is from England ( we are in the USA) so I already warned my mom I may have to be elsewhere for the holidays for my mental health.

I finally was able to have a saline ultrasound today to make sure that what may have been spotted as a polyp during the D&C, wasn't actually a polyp. I've waited for this news for a long time, and basically worked out I'd get two possible answers; 1) that its just the very small fibroid I know I have in there, TTC at your leisure or 2) its a polyp, time to schedule polypectomy (which I had done enough reading about to know it was relatively easy, and would improve my chances of carrying, and I was on board with this.) I guess I knew there'd be an option for a 3) but I didn't factor it in. 

Turns out, no polyp - just the small, symptom-less fibroid I knew I had, that didn't interfere with conceiving, and that I have been promised over and over didn't cause the MC. Saline ultrasound reveal it is in the uterine cavity, not in the walls, but that was the extent of the revelation. However, the doctor still wants to discuss me getting surgery to remove it.

I'm confused, because as far as I can tell, there's no need to do this - unless I have trouble conceiving or it causes me pain, right? (We conceived on the third cycle, unless we got extra lucky I'm not sure that's a problem). Also not that a polypectomy is minor, but a myomectomy seems like way more of ""a thing"" with more potential complications and longer recovery. 

Anyway, I guess I'm asking for...myomectomy experiences, fibroid experiences, or anything like that you all might have to share. I'm going to be pushing my doc to really make the case for surgery to me in a few weeks, because I certainly don't want to do it if it's unnecessary.

I'm new to this community and so happy that it exists.

I'm waiting for my second period after my loss (at 15 weeks pregnant on April 16th), and am on day 29. Pre-miscarriage, my periods were regular.  I got my first period 5.5 weeks after my loss. When I got that period, my breasts were not tender as they normally would be leading up, and I didn't have any cramps when I got my period, which is not normal for me either. Now, 29 days from that first period, there's no sign of the next one. My breasts, again, are not tender... the only normal thing is the moodiness (ha!) . 

Waiting for that first period after miscarriage was so rough. I felt like I was in limbo. I was SO emotional, and it was really hard having no clue when I would bleed. Now I kind of feel like I'm back in that same space, as my usual symptoms are not present.

I guess my question is, would anyone be willing to share what their cycle lengths were like after miscarriage? And did you also experience different symptoms like lessened or no breast tenderness?

After the second CP, i started taking Inositol, even if I don't have PCOS, but my OBGYN advised to do so, in order to improve egg quality. I also took Omega 3, 6, 9 and Selenium as i have subclinic Hashimoto's (TSH normal, no substitute for thyroid needed).

Since then, my cycles have shortened from 26-27 days to 24 days, then 21 and this month i had AF after only 12!! days since the last one. 

I am sure Inositol is to blame, i didn't even ovulated since taking it. 

Has anyone experienced this? Because i only heard/read good things about it from ladies with PCOS... Anyways, i stopped it because i'm affraid not to do more harm.

In the meantime I did a full panel of blood work, includig MTHFR, PAI, Prothrombinic mutation gene II, V Leyden as my OBGYN suspects thrombophylia (my sister also had 2 MC before having the first child, with baby aspirin daily until the 32rd week - which i cannot take because of the allergy i have). I am still waiting for the results, other than that all the other results came out perfectly.

I wonder what can i do to bring back my perfectly timed ovulation and my regular cycle which was at 26 days for years now... i now I messed up but i want to try again and not give up

About a week prior to this I started getting a weird pulling/burning feeling on my left side of my pelvic area. Kind of like a pulled muscle feeling so I thought it was round ligament pain.

So I have continued to get this pain on and off and I thought it was every thing from a new PSM symptom, to ovulation pain (however I haven;t actually ovulated since MC and I am about to start cycle 3 after MC). It's worse today, but I am supposed to get my period tomorrow or Thursday. However, it started to bother me from about CD10 till my period. It's not extremely painful, just annoying.
