My wife and I found out she was pregnant the day before my birthday in January with our first and I was over the moon excited. Then, at the end of March, we lost our son, Walker, very suddenly at 19 weeks. It's been incredibly hard to deal with, but we both decided we wanted to try again as soon as the doctor gave us clearance. He told us to wait one cycle, and we have, so here we are.


I originally started reading here at my wife's suggestion (she's a lurker here) and I have to tell you all that it has helped immeasurably to interact with others who have been through similar experiences and are currently dealing with some of the same struggles. Being here has not only helped me deal with his loss but has helped me feel more involved in the TTC process and helps me feel like I am doing something.

A bit of back story- I am a 28 yo female with PCOS and hypothyroidism. Hubby and I started TTC May 1st of this year. I've had issues with super long cycles due to PCOS and was put on metformin 2000mg a day back in March which seemed to cut my 35+ day cycles to an average 28 days for both March and April. Then May hit and we started actively trying.  My OB ordered a standing order of progesterone for my day21. I did it in May and it came back a measly 3. Meaning I had not ovulated. I was upset because having never gotten a + OPK even tho we weren't yet TTC I had been monitoring it under the suspicion I may not be ovulating. I wrote off May as an anovulatory month and hoped for better for June. 

Then before I knew it I was back to a super long cycle by the end of May AF still hadn't come and finally on Sunday (June 8th I took a preg test to rule it out and it was a faint but very there positive). My hubby and I were elated but wanted to be sure as I knew I must have ovulated VERY late. Like.. After Day24 of my cycle. Had my first HCG level done Monday and it came back a measly 15. Still hopeful though. 

I took a whole bunch of HCG pee tests on Tuesday because the line seemed lighter and my sore breasts had seemed to settle down. I had to wait another 24 hours before my next HCG draw. Finally Wednesday came and I went to the lab and got my blood drawn again. In the meantime at work I noticed a very slight amount of pink tinged mucous when I wiped. I knew it wasn't going to stick then but the second HCG level came back a 9 and I knew for sure. Later on in the evening my cramps got pretty unbearable  and I started spotting more. Today I haven't been able to leave my apartment because it feels like the heaviest, crampiest period I've ever had. 

On one hand I'm happy because at least I know I can get pregnant, but I'm worried because I ovulated so late this might be an indicator I may have viability issues. 

I'm counting today at CD2 and hoping my cycle regulates enough again that I ovulate within a normal time. 

Has anyone had any successful late ovulation pregnancies?

- Anyone in Southern California who wants to acquire 600 units reduced price Follistim, PM me. Vials are not intact (a dose has been used from each) but have been handled with extreme care. Progesterone and estrogen are also available. Yes, legality of sharing meds is questionable. I also don't know how you explain having them to a doctor who prescribes them (""That's OK, I've got my own."") But I entrust that decision to your care.

- During the IVF follow-up call, the doctor recommended, based on the disappointing development of my embryos--which suggested either damaged DNA (can't be helped) or poor egg quality (maybe can be helped)--CoQ10 and DHEA.

Lemme break this down.

After two years of treatment, as a 34-36-year-old patient (so obviously poor egg quality is a likelihood), with borderline-to-elevated FSH (10.8 to 11.3), through one HSG (normal), one natural chemical pregnancy, three Clomid/trigger/IUI cycles (no success), a repeat HSG (my request), and an IVF cycle with an iffy antral follicle count (9)...

IVF, with its 35+ pages of consent forms...
Over a dozen self injections...
Ovary-risking medications...
Life-risking sedation...
$13000+ out of pocket...
Say nothing of the IUI cycle $$...
Say nothing of the emotional cost...

After all that...

The doctor mentions two harmless nutritional supplements you can find at the grocery store.

When he mentioned these supplements--which I had seen mentioned online but assumed were snake oil, because if they weren't, wouldn't my RE have mentioned them?--I became quite angry. I asked why he hadn't mentioned them earlier.

He said he only suggests what is indicated by the evidence.

And I said, why, when compared to the cost of IVF, taking CoQ10 is utterly trivial?

He said they can't go around suggesting everything that ""might"" work.

So I pointed out the steroidal anti-inflammatory prescribed for IVF, which was clearly optional (since the he forgot to tell me to take it earlier when moving my 5-day transfer up to 3-day)...

And he went into a small lecture about how medicine works, but I didn't listen too closely, because he was talking for his benefit, not mine.

I know I have a lot of ambient anger about infertility in general. If anything, this doctor was kind to give me a convenient focus for it.

But TTC is hell. IVF was hell in its own way. And not mentioning a cheap, harmless supplement two years ago?

Even three months ago, when it could have--studies show, as I now Google--improved the quality of the eggs they got out of me?

Unforgivable.

At any rate, it'll be a long time before I do IVF again, if at all--and definitely not with this doctor--and the Follistim is only good for a couple more months.

So hit me up.

I'm new here and just need to vent to people I think will understand. I was Diagnosed with PCOS in November after a year of trying unsuccessfully, went through three cycles of clomid with ovidrel trigger shot. Then on our second IUI, it was like every lined up perfectly. Just turned 30 and I was pregnant!! My husband and I were thrilled. Until this past Tuesday.

I started having sharp pains and called my dr. Sure enough ultrasound confirmed the ectopic at almost six week, and I was sent to the ER for emergency surgery. They took my right tube with the embryo and. Checked my left tube, found some blocking and cleared it. They also did a d&amp;c.

I'm holding out hope my left tube will heal well enough for another IUI attempt. If not I guess our next step will be IVF. 

I feel like everything was so rushed with the surgery it's such now setting in that I lost the pregnancy and I'm devastated.

Has anyone experienced an ectopic pregnancy and successfully gotten pregnant again ?

I'm not coping. AT ALL. I haven't even processed my second miscarriage. We're still living together (we're both moving in two weeks) and every time I see him I cry. All over him.  I'm barely coping. He's my best friend and has been for seven years. We've spoken nearly every day for nine years. The thought that by the end of the month i won't be seeing him every day or talking to him is like a stab in the gut. But I need to as he doesn't love my romantically anymore and I deserve that. But I'm dying at that thought. I honestly feel like I'll die without him. (I am NOT suicidal) I'm in my 30s and he was my first serious relationship so this is my first break up. 

His parents are here overnight tomorrow and it's going to be horrific. I put a fair amount of blame on them for this because it all started happening once we moved in and they got in his ear. First six months he'd take my side whenever there were issues (and they were always having issues with me) Then it became 'I don't want to be in the middle anymore' and that's the time he started having issues. And I'm so angry at him for that. Because I deserved to be alerted that there were issues before his fucking parents. And I deserved to hear of it before I told him I thought I was pregnant the second time only to be met with the response 'well I guess I'm stuck with you now' I deserve someone who will fight for me and it breaks me it's not him. 

To top it all off I finally got my period today, first time since the miscarriage. And I'm destroyed. Because last week I was having symptoms that were so similar to my other pregnancies and there was that hope. And while logically I know it's for the best not to be tied to him, emotionally I wanted his baby. It's also now two weeks since my original baby was due. I want a baby so badly and now I know it's a long way off, if ever. 

I alternate between wishing this was a nightmare (though after all this I won't take him back) to hating him to hating that I hate him. I feel so pathetic and broken right now. And the actual nightmares I'm having are making me wake up crying.

OB advised me to wait for one period before trying because it would make it ""complicated"" if I got pregnant without a full cycle.

I'm sorry I don't have the energy to individually respond to you all.  Its 10am and I have made it out of bed. First thing I did was make an appointment with my OB as I have little faith in the GPs. I have also been able to request a psychologist referral.
Shortly after making this I began to miscarry.
I have not yet heard from my GP, but I will have to call them as I need a medical certificate - I won't be going in to work tonight.
I am shaking, but a little more to terms with it.  Although I have been very anxious throughout and could not see ahead of each day, I didn't actually expect this to happen.

I can not imaging how I would have felt if I had not contacted the nurse yesterday to find my HCG was dropping - I would have been miscarrying on the way home from work or worse at work.  This is a new experience for me as my last one was a D&C at 9 weeks.  I am guessing since it is so early there shouldn't be any complications.

I am really pissed off at the GP.

Thank you again for all the love.

Edit: so I called my GP and *she hasn't even checked my blood results yet*. She was in yesterday, but obviously didn't check them, even though I called and the nurse was aware they had dropped.  So much for keeping a very close eye on things for me.  I have asked them to get her to call me back when she gets in at 1445.

And the story changes.

I learned about this sub from the ladies over at r/CautiousBB and figured I'd come over and do an intro since I'm really hoping to be actively involved over here. My husband and I learned on Friday at our 12 week ultrasound that the fetus stopped growing at 7 weeks and had no heartbeat. I miscarried naturally over this weekend (worst pain of my life, good lord!) and the bleeding/cramping/contractions seem to finally be settling down. (It wasn't my plan to go natural - I wanted the D&C - but my body moved too fast.)  
  
We're both 34 years old and I'm not gonna lie: I'm so scared that I'm too old to conceive again. We got pregnant on the third cycle the first time around (and it was the first cycle where we used the OPKs correctly.) Emotionally we're both handling this really well and we both want to try again as soon as possible, both because we really want a baby and because I'll be 35 so soon. I'll be going in to see my midwife for blood work on Wednesday and I'm hoping my hcg levels will have gone down significantly (maybe even to 0). 
  
So, if my hcg goes back to 0, is it safe for us to start trying? I know we'll probably wait one cycle, but I cannot imagine dealing with condoms for the next month! (I had an IUD for the last 8 years so condoms aren't really a part of our sexy times :P) I'd really love to hear from other ladies about their experiences trying soon after a natural miscarriage (no D&C / cytotec). Is not-trying-not-preventing a really irresponsible idea?

I am 30, husband is 32. Decided to start TTC in February 2015 but due to coming off birth control had a weird cycle. CD35 (negative HPT) my friend suggested I do an OPK. Positive! Immediately headed to the bedroom. My husband was out of town for the next 4 days. Wasn't really tracking so we kept trying every other day.  2.5 weeks later got a BFP. Went to the doctor and was told I was due about 6 days later than I thought. Ok, 6 days, not a big deal. Except it stuck with me, always in the back of my mind was that isn't right. Had a great 6 week and 9 week appointment. 12 weeks my world fell apart. Even though this is our first loss, we are having testing done on me and the baby. If I can get info, I want it. 

Now on to the TTC part. We are going to wait one cycle, so if everything is ""normal,"" begin next month. I just stopped spotting from the D&C and want to start temping, using OPKs and checking my cervix. I know my body will be off, but will this give me any data? Any tips on how to increase our chances? We are both limiting the number of drinks we have per week, exercise, take vitamins and eat well. I had purchased some Vitex and Red Raspberry leaf supplements, but my doctor said it could just mess up my cycle more and to not take them.
