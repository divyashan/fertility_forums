9,2048,confidence,<praw.reddit.Reddit object at 0x7f12a630cd90>,,ttcafterloss,"Hi all. This is my first post on this sub after lurking for awhile and seeing the genuine support people give and get here. It's probably healthy for me to find a space like this since only my DH and my mother have been privy to my pain, overanalysis, and anxiety over the last few months. So I'm straying from my usual ""introverted lurking botte-it-all-up"" self and posting.

I'm 26 years old and I've been married for 2 years, but we've been together for almost 9. I've always had irregular cycles and was diagnosed with polycystic ovaries back in January when I went in for a preconception checkup. I guess it was then that I had my first inkling that things weren't exactly going to be a piece of cake.

We started TTC in March of this year, and I was ecstatic when I found out I was pregnant in April (April fools day, should have figured). We told our parents and siblings, and I told my childhood best friend. On April 23, the night we moved into our new house, I had my first MC at about 6 weeks. I don't think I had ever been so terrified and helpless in my life. I had just stood in what was going to be the baby's room on that day and started envisioning the nursery. It took me awhile before I could even go in there alone after the MC. I went to my OB the next day and he confirmed the MC and advised I wait 1 cycle before TTC again.

 In June, we went on a cruise for our second wedding anniversary (I actually O'd on that night--how perfect would that've been?) and I found out shortly thereafter that I was pregnant. I made my first OB appointment for 5wks (the doc said he'd like to see me sooner than 8wks because of my prior MC). On the morning of my appointment, I MC'd a second time. My OB said it was low progesterone that caused my second (and probably my first) MC. He prescribed me oral prometrium to start taking 3 DPO of my next cycle TTC. To be honest, I've been mad, sad, and unmotivated since the first MC. I still randomly cry when I look at things, like the ""baby's room"" and the beanbag chair I MC'd in.

Fast forward to today. I'm on CD 25 and I've had characteristic O signs, reinforced by positive OPKs today and yesterday. I'm really hoping to see a BBT rise tomorrow to confirm O. Really hopeful that somehow an egg found its way past those cysts again. Really hopeful it's viable and meets a viable sperm partner. Really hopeful they find their way. And most of all, really hopeful that we can make it past 6 weeks with this progesterone to help us out. I feel like TTCing after a loss takes the normal feelings of a TWW and amps them up by about a magnitude of 1000. Anyways, thanks for reading.

There's a specialty in OB for High Risk pregnancies.  They're pregnancies by women who have a greater risk of complications due to health conditions, age, weight, etc.  When they bring you on board, they test for A LOT of things that a standard OB or RE does not test for.  Genetic problems between you and your spouse, blood clotting disorders, etc.

I have a friend who miscarried one of her twins.  When she got pregnant again, she was much older and saw one of these doctors.  Turns out, she had a minor blood clotting issue, and the fact that she laid on her left side while pregnant likely caused the blood to the right baby's placenta to clot, and choked off the blood supply.  

She had another friend who had multiple miscarriages.  I believe the number was 4.  This lady had been seeing an RE, and they couldn't answer why she continued miscarrying.  She went to the same high risk OB and found out she had a more serious blood clotting disorder that was choking out the placenta, and she took a pill every day and carried her next pregnancy to term.

I've asked my RE for a referral to my local high risk OB for a preconception consult, where they'll do all that bloodwork and let me know if there's anything more we can do to ensure a healthy pregnancy next time around.

Some of you may remember me, I was on the sub in the late summer and fall of last year after my beautiful daughter, Marin was born at 24.3, lived with so much strength for 13 days in the NICU and then died on 8/25/15. 
It's been a rough fucking year full of a few ups and lots of challenges. 
I had a transabdominal cerclage placed in January of this year with the hopes of conceiving again and not having to deal with the same early birth issues that we did with our daughter. It was pretty clear that I have an incompetent cervix.  
We've been TTC since February with nothing to report but then I had a positive pregnancy test early July. I had blood work done at my request which showed my numbers doubling and then suddenly stopped and then a drop followed by a natural miscarriage about a week and a half later.  I'm trying to take it all in stride but with Marin's birthday coming up in less than 2 weeks and the month of August starting today, I'm feeling the impending doom and I'm just trying to distract myself as much as possible. 
I was referred to fertility prior to becoming pregnant and now I am just waiting for my period to show up again to get my blood work done. 
I can't believe that it's been almost a year since I held my baby girl. Sometimes she just feels like a dream. I've been having flashbacks of being in the hospital recently and can actually feel her skin and her teeny tiny finger holding on to mine. 
I'm so emotionally tired and now with this recent miscarriage, I am also unbelievably terrified.
I have been back here randomly lurking in the sub recently and decided to reintroduce myself since I sometimes need to just vent. I've made some amazing friends with other loss mamas from here and other groups but sometimes I just need to write out my complaints, ya know what I mean?

It's been a while since I've posted here and I'm so sorry to only reach out when I feel like i need it (feeling a little selfish here), but I'm kind of at a loss. I honestly didn't think the emotional pain post D&C would be this difficult.

I had the procedure done three weeks ago, then a spine surgery immediately following. Both procedures went well. Took a while for the dust to settle, but now I feel like I'm in such an incredibly dark place. I worry that I'm putting all this on my s/o, and the last thing I want to do is put more stress on him. He has been incredibly supportive and I know he's dealing with the loss, as well.

Ive been having crying spells pretty much constantly. They come out when I least expect it. Everything that has happened to us since, I feel like is some kind of punishment-we've had a string of bad luck and I can't help but feel like it's my fault. My s/o even said yesterday, after a particularly rough day, ""I feel like we're being punished"". The feeling of guilt is strong and I'm praying that it isn't permanent. 

Honestly, I'm a generally happy and warm person-these feelings are in an unfamiliar territory for me. I don't want to keep breaking down in front of my s/o. I feel like I should be moving on from this but I'm just stuck. 

Guess I'm just reaching out for some encouragement that this does get better. I think most friends and family think it's ""over"" and we've moved on. That's so far from the truth, but I feel weak/scared to reach out to them. I don't want them to think I'm not strong enough to handle this. 

The days are dark and although everyone keeps trying to get me to focus on the good and exciting things to come (we're planning an engagement in the near future), I can't help but focus on the now. The today-the darkness is current and doesn't seem like it's going anywhere anytime soon. 

Thank you for listening. This is a supportive place and I'm so lucky to have found you.

I have been pregnant 4 times and have 1 living child. First pregnancy was a scary pregnancy due to growth issues inside the womb and the delivery was just as terrifying, but fortunately our daughter made it and we were told the problems we encountered were just bad luck and wouldn't happen again if/when we tried for #2. Once our daughter was getting close to turning 2, we decided that we wanted to try adding onto our family. We were pregnant within a few months, but that pregnancy ended in miscarriage. We decided to try again right away and were once again lucky to become pregnant quickly. That pregnany ended in miscarriage as well. At this point I was starting to get a bit nervous, but all the doctors reassumed me that it was likely just bad luck and that I would have a successful pregnancy if we continued trying. So we did continue to try and it was not too long before we found out we were expecting. I thought this was it and this would be our rainbow baby. Everything about the pregnancy seemed to be going great and we were so thrilled to have what we thought was a textbook perfect pregnancy! Then at 19.5 weeks, during the anatomy scan, we found out our baby had passed away in the womb. Our son was delivered that night and it was the most heart breaking moment of our lives.
Now my post-partum visit is coming up soon and the testing to find out what is wrong with me will begin. So far it sounds like I have some sort of clotting disorder as there were many clots found within the placenta and they were determined to be the cause of my son's death. We would like try continue trying for a baby but I'm starting to feel like I'm cursed at this point.

I had small amounts of spotting here and there, which really freaked me out, but everything I read said as long as it was not bright red, it was normal. 

At 9w, I began bleeding, bright red, and it was accompanied by moderate cramping. I called my doctor's after-hours line and they assured me that it could be nothing, since I wasn't filling a pad, but made me an appointment the next day. 

The next day, I went for an ultrasound (my first) and all of the sudden on the screen, I see two sacs. Two empty sacs. I knew from creeping on every pregnancy board known to man that there should have been something visible in those sacs at 9 weeks. The u/s tech said she had to have a doctor double-check the measurements and came back to say they were measuring 5w1d and 5w2d. 

Went upstairs to see the doctor (I go to a multi-doc practice, this was one I hadn't seen before) and when she walked in, she asked why I was crying. Ughhhhhhhhhhhh I am still so mad about that. 
She was otherwise kind and said that they couldn't say anything was wrong, they were measuring early, but maybe my dates were off? (I knew my dates were not off, I've been tracking my period for a decade.) They couldn't make any decisions until I had a follow-up u/s. Was told to make an appointment for the following week to re-measure and was sent home, with instructions to call if the bleeding got worse. 

Saturday and Sunday were filled with more of the light bleeding, I never filled a pad - but it was heavier than spotting, and some of the worst cramps I've ever felt. Called the doctor again Monday morning and was sent to the ER. Was told that they would page one of the OBs from my practice when I got there. 

Got another pelvic exam, another ultrasound, another pee-test and towards the very end, the ER doc told me they were beginning to see signs of a miscarriage. I never saw one of my OBs but was told the doctor called them and they (OB's office) would call me for an appointment the next day. 

Went down the next day, doctor told me that she knew it was a very emotional time for me but they have to be very cautious unless there are actual signs of miscarriage, which I hadn't been showing, but now I was. Gave me options and I scheduled a D&C for the next day. 

I was having such a hard time coping with this, I knew that I could not handle a natural miscarriage. Also, I wasn't sure if it would be twice as worse since there were two of them? Regardless, I did not want to find out and so much power to those of you that go through the process at home. 

D&C was fine, I have been put under a few times, but when they said it was just twilight, I became terrified that I would wake up in the middle. The anesthesiologist assured me that I would not, and sure enough I didn't wake up until it was over. As soon as they removed the oxygen mask, I began sobbing. Due to grief or relief that it was over, (both?) I'm not entirely sure. 

Had some severe cramping ~2 hours after the procedure so I took one of the painkillers they gave me, but I've been pretty much pain-free otherwise. Some very very light spotting for the past ~5 days, but looks like that may be done as well.

While waiting to find out if I was having a miscarriage, I had contacted the few people that knew I was pregnant, just to give them a heads up and I found 2 of them had miscarried before and I had never known (and one was my sister). I started to write a long blog post about my experience, but decided not to post.

I was part of a fun little twitter group for secretly pregnant people, so I was able to tell some of my story there, but only in 140 character bursts. And now that I'm no longer pregnant, it is not the right place for me. So here I am. Waiting for my period to start up again and trying to decide if I want to try again as soon as I can.

Hy husband and I recently started seeing a fertility specialist. Tests and procedures have generally gone well, and we're about to start our first round of Clomid.

My problem is that this past year has been emotionally draining. I've had to learn to shut off certain feelings and become detached. Everyone around me has been getting pregnant (best friend, 2 other close friends, and seemingly everyone I work with). It was really hard at first, but got somewhat easier as time passed. But now, now I'm having a hard time feeling happy/excited about the prospect of getting pregnant again. I feel like all those emotions are locked away in a box and I don't know how to get them out. I just feel kinda empty and like i'm going through the motions.

On the one hand, I feel like this is a blessing. Even if I do get pregnant again, there's no guarantee it will work out, so the less excited I am, the better. But the lack of feeling is making me doubt if this is something I even want to do still. Deep down, I feel like it is, but these conflicting feelings are starting to mess with me. 

I spoke to my husband and he said he feels similar. Like there's something preventing him from getting excited because he's scared it will all get ripped away from us again. So it's comforting to know that I'm not the only one feeling this way. But I just hate it. I picture holding my baby in my arms and still feeling empty inside and that makes me sad.

Throughout all the testing, it was discovered that my thyroid levels were a little off, so I started taking medicine for that. The doctor also had me start taking vitamin d and coenzyme Q10 (along with the pre-natal vitamin I'm already taking). So I don't know if any of that could also be contributing to this feeling. 

I guess I just wanted to know if any of you lovely ladies had gone through anything similar to this? Also I would love to hear about anyone's experience with Clomid.

This was my first pregnancy and my boyfriend and I had only been trying for one cycle. I miscarried last month after being sent to a military promotion board. These things are meant to induce stress and gauge your reaction to it in order to evaluate your capabilities to act as a noncommissioned officer. I started light spotting the next day, but was reassured by the OB triage nurse the morning after that (""light brown spotting can be okay, don't worry about it too much and try not to worry""). I went to the ER that weekend after the spotting turned bright red and was told I was miscarrying, so much for the false hope. The following Monday I was given Misoprostol and completed the miscarriage on June 7. 

I had a week and a half off and returned to work still a complete wreck. Even though I was ""only"" 9 weeks along, everyone in my unit knew I was pregnant. I wish I had a job where I could have kept it a secret and kept this loss between myself and my boyfriend, but that's not how the military works. Nobody in my family or any of my pre-military friends knew, so that helped. But work was miserable. Everybody had something to say - the vast majority of it was kind words or offers to help out. Their wives had been through it, etc. But my first day back my leadership approached me wanting a paper saying I was no longer pregnant so that I could return to full duty and go with my unit to the field in a couple weeks. They had been really angry after a third female in our unit had found out she was pregnant. So now that I'm no longer pregnant, I'm good, right? They need the numbers because replacements for PCSs and ETSs haven't shown up yet and I'm just a number after all. Anyway, after holding going to the field over my head for a couple of weeks they finally relented and let me stay back because of my numerous counseling appointments. (I feel like I should point out that I usually have nothing against going to the field. Two weeks without showering, sleeping outside under the stars, lugging equipment around and actually doing my job is NOT an issue. My problem was being surrounded by people, especially the ones I no longer trust, that has been intolerable). 

My boyfriend is currently transitioning out of the military and moving to another state. This is our last chance at TTC before he goes. The week my unit rolled out to the field, my HCG finally hit 3 and I started my period two days after getting the news. If it doesn't work then there's a window around Christmas when I can see him. If not, I won't have another chance until I'm out of the military. I'll be 32 by then. I feel like I've wasted away my fertile years on the military and the wrong men. 

Last week was a good week, what with there being fewer people around because most of the others were in the field. But this week I've been in a silent rage mode all week. I'm stressed about how my unit will handle it if I get pregnant again and I'm stressed about how my body will handle it if I don't. Will they react the same way they did as when the third female announced? Will it be too late for me if I wait until I'm out of the military? If I get pregnant, how will I handle it without him around? For that matter, how will I handle it without him around if I don't get pregnant?

These questions and more are hanging over my head. I won't be able to answer them for another two weeks or so, and in the meantime I'm just so angry.

81,2048,confidence,<praw.reddit.Reddit object at 0x7f12a630cd90>,,ttcafterloss,"Hi All, 

I found this thread last night - I had a complete miscarriage on June 6 with my first pregnancy and I am still thick within this journey of what this kind of loss feels like. It was early - we were a little over six weeks but in the two weeks we knew about the pregnancy before the miscarriage... it was like living in Candyland (albeit one with a lot of indigestion), especially since we had been TTC for about a year (6 months seriously with opks, temping, etc.) and I'm no spring chicken.

The waves come and go... I get angry and sad at how my body feels now, I get angry and sad at how much I want it to feel pregnant again. I'll feel grateful that my miscarriage came early because hope and future thinking seems to double faster than hcg. I feel my heart opening up to all of the women and couples who have had mcs and stillbirths, who start thinking that their body is an enemy and not a safe home for new life. 

Sooo we are back at it this cycle. I've found boards like this on the bump and others.... but there is something about the way so many of you write as much and as thoughtfully as you do about your feelings (over just TTC tips) that made me finally want to say something and stop lurking. I've been on the verge of almost taking anything and everything - baby aspirin, vitex, etc. - without talking to my doctor or even telling my husband, but I know that's not the way to go. 

I found myself crying when I read so many of your words and about how you've come to understand your experiences. I've talked with close family members and friends about it... but it's funny the way that sharing has made me realize that so many of us suffer in relative silence about this in our everyday lives. I've started feeling like there is this dividing line between women (and couples) who this has happened to and those who it hasn't.

Even through all the negative thoughts and pain... what I do know is that having a mc gave me a perspective on life that I'd never felt before. I can be both afraid of never getting pregnant again and of getting pregnant again (translation miscarrying again). I can both never forget the hopes and dreams I had for the baby we were to have in January and create new ones.

My name isn't Malika, that's just a character from a video game I am currently playing :-) I'm 32 and live in continental Europe. English isn't my native language.

 My husband and I decided to try for kids two years ago. I first had to get off methotrexate which I'd been taking for my rheumatoid arthritis (and which is very bad to take firing pregnancy). Had my IUD taken out in November and I got pregnant right away, never even got my period. Miscarried right away as well, over Christmas 2014. 

After recovery, I got pregnant again in the next cycle in February. The ultrasounds showed two gestational sacs  but at 7.4 weeks there still weren't any heartbeats, so I had a D&C. At that point the husband and I decided to stop trying for a while, and I also started getting therapy for my dysthymia (low-level chronic depression, of course made worse by my general health and the miscarriages). 

We started trying again in July 2015, and by September I was pregnant again. At seven weeks, there was a strong heartbeat on the ultrasound. At 8 weeks, it had stopped. Another D&C, and finally, some tests. Unfortunately, nothing has been found so far. 

Well, not really nothing , as my TSH was too high during that least pregnancy. My idiot gynecologist never told me that could be a problem - he knew I have hypothyroidism and I even asked him whether this needed to be checked and he just saw no need. I am still so angry about that - I did get it tested by my GP in the end because I was worried and it was 2.7 that last week (didn't get the results until heartbeat had already stopped...). 

I was and still am angry at that. I now have a new gynecologist. 

We're now in the ninth cycle of trying for the fourth time. I am getting so frustrated and impatient... I know that a positive pregnancy test will trigger anxiety and worries, but at least then I can get that over with, you know?

<p>My name isn&#39;t Malika, that&#39;s just a character from a video game I am currently playing :-) I&#39;m 32 and live in continental Europe. English isn&#39;t my native language.</p>

<p>My husband and I decided to try for kids two years ago. I first had to get off methotrexate which I&#39;d been taking for my rheumatoid arthritis (and which is very bad to take firing pregnancy). Had my IUD taken out in November and I got pregnant right away, never even got my period. Miscarried right away as well, over Christmas 2014. </p>

<p>After recovery, I got pregnant again in the next cycle in February. The ultrasounds showed two gestational sacs  but at 7.4 weeks there still weren&#39;t any heartbeats, so I had a D&amp;C. At that point the husband and I decided to stop trying for a while, and I also started getting therapy for my dysthymia (low-level chronic depression, of course made worse by my general health and the miscarriages). </p>

<p>We started trying again in July 2015, and by September I was pregnant again. At seven weeks, there was a strong heartbeat on the ultrasound. At 8 weeks, it had stopped. Another D&amp;C, and finally, some tests. Unfortunately, nothing has been found so far. </p>

<p>Well, not really nothing , as my TSH was too high during that least pregnancy. My idiot gynecologist never told me that could be a problem - he knew I have hypothyroidism and I even asked him whether this needed to be checked and he just saw no need. I am still so angry about that - I did get it tested by my GP in the end because I was worried and it was 2.7 that last week (didn&#39;t get the results until heartbeat had already stopped...). </p>

<p>I was and still am angry at that. I now have a new gynecologist. </p>

<p>We&#39;re now in the ninth cycle of trying for the fourth time. I am getting so frustrated and impatient... I know that a positive pregnancy test will trigger anxiety and worries, but at least then I can get that over with, you know? </p>

<p>Anyway, that&#39;s some of my story. I&#39;ve been reading through the rules and a few weeks of posts and this community seems really nice, I&#39;m glad to have found it! </p>

As some of you saw, I tore my meniscus on Saturday. I may need surgery. But even if not, I most definitely can't do any of the active things I enjoy for awhile now. And it might change our Germany plans. Sigh. So I'm going to the orthopedic later today to find out more.

My biopsy results came back normal, which of course is great! But its the last test they could think of. So I met with my RE today for a plan and am now gonna be on some meds. Including taking Femara next time we try. Ok ok...fine.

But the doc agreed I shouldn't take it in August in case it works and I find out I'm pregnant IN Europe. I already assumed that. But THEN he also said he didn't want me taking it for the first time WHILE IN Europe, so now I'm looking at the October cycle before we can try again. RAWR.

Then, of course, today is the day my bro/SIL found out their baby's gender.  They asked if I'd want to know, or if they should wait til I ask them later...which I appreciated. I told them to let me know. BUT THEN they sent a GROUP TEXT. To like 12 people. So everyone keeps replying. Ahhhh. Not what I meant, guys. You tried, but...failed.

AND THEN the freaking Babies R Us called me to let me know what date I have to finish my registry by and to let me know they're sending my completion coupon.

WHAT THE ACTUAL HELL? Can I get a damn break over here?!

**edit** My orthopedic thinks its more likely my MCL but possibly my meniscus. So I have to get an MRI (which I figured). If its meniscus that's most likely surgery and ~4 weeks on crutches. If its MCL its not surgery but 8-10 weeks of therapy. Either way BLOWS cause we go to Europe in 6.5 weeks. :(

I know nobody thinks they'll miscarry. This was my first pregnancy and I felt so lucky, like I hit the jackpot because it was our first cycle trying too. 

I was six weeks one day when I started spotting, and that spotting ended up getting heavier with clots. 

I was on a roadtrip with my husband when we stopped 2 hours in and I realized this wasn't normal. 

My husband and I drove all the way home, and waited at the ER for two hours. The nurse took a ton of my blood and was not careful about it. I waited and waited to see the gyno on shift but finally I just told them I was going home. I was feeling like shit and tired of being in the sterile hospital helpless.

I'm making an appointment tomorrow with my obgyn. 

I feared this nightmare since day one of my pregnancy. I would look every day at the pages for chances of miscarriage by day of pregnancy, thankful to make it to 6 weeks. 

I lost my baby. I'm just so upset, so angry. 

My husband is ok and just wants to try again. I do too when I can, but I don't feel like I'll even be excited about it when I get pregnant again. 

I feel so empty. :(
