This year, after two failed IUI in 2017, we had to decided: what do we do next? Initially, I was leaning towards donor embryo with a surrogate but in Canada, it isn't really simple: you actually have to buy them frozen from the states, it's reallllly pricy and it has to be from one specific donor bank or the clinic won't accept it. Thankfully though, we had a friend who had offered to be our surrogate. In my mind, using donor eggs and a surrogate would prevent my ptsd of going through another loss and feeling like it was my fault. 

The other option? Try IVF with my own eggs and PGS test them. We went to our clinic to discuss our options and we learned that our clinic, which is the only one in our province, doesn't do PGS and the only way we could do it is to fly to another clinic in another province... We read a lot about ALL the options and after seeing my therapist and talk about it, we finally decided to still go through IVF with my own eggs and if we are lucky enough to have more than one embryo, to try a fresh transfer (in me) and if it's not working, try it with a surrogate. 

Things I was worried the most about IVF? 

- The meds/hormones causing migraines (or just feeling yucky). Thankfully, I only got one (awful) 4 day migraine while taking the birth control pill. For the rest of the IVF, I felt great! 

- Taking time off from work. I'm a parole officer and right now we are super short staff with 3 on stress leave. Taking off and putting more work on my lovely colleagues's shoulders was rough but after talking to them about the treatment they all encouraged me and convinced me to take time for the treatment. 

- Not having enough eggs and ending up with nothing except a 11 000$ bill. IVF is such a gamble and thinking that we could spend so much money for nothing in return just eats me inside but right now I've dig this emotion very deep and hope it stays there. 

Five days ago, they retrieved 13 eggs and on day 3, I still had 12 eggs on the go. Today was my day 5 transfer and I learned that I got 11 blastocysts and 9 are all graded between 4AA-4BB and another one not as great but still good to freeze. I wish they were PGS tested, since it would give me an idea if they are normal, but right now I'm just trying to savour this tiny victory: we've completed our IVF and it went well and we know that we got extremely lucky to have 11 blasts out of 13 eggs and freezed 10 of them. Right now I have a grade 4 AA in my uterus and I want to be hopeful that this will finally be our golden ticket to a child but as of now, I'm just going to celebrate this tiny victory that I've completed my IVF cycle and that my body didn't fail me like it did so many times. 

Why am I writing all this? Because trying to conceive after miscarriage(s) just brings you down physically and mentally to the point that it taints everything around you in the saddest way. When I made the decision to do IVF, it was after I told my husband that we were done after this, no matter what the outcome - I will finally stop hating my body for not being able to do what it is supposed to do. 

So now, no matter what happens: we'll have tried it all. 11 chances and then, that is it that is all!

It's strangely a relief to see the light at the end of the tunnel, no matter what the outcome.

Today was my day 5 transfer and I learned that I got 11 blastocysts and 9 are all graded between 4AA-4BB and another one not as great but still good to freeze. I wish they were PGS tested, since it would give me an idea if they are normal, but right now I&#39;m just trying to savour this tiny victory: we&#39;ve completed our IVF and it went well and we know that we got extremely lucky to have 11 blasts out of 13 eggs and freezed 10 of them. Right now I have a grade 4 AA in my uterus and I want to be hopeful that this will finally be our golden ticket to a child but as of now, I&#39;m just going to celebrate this tiny victory that I&#39;ve completed my IVF cycle and that my body didn&#39;t fail me like it did so many times. </p>

<p>Why am I writing all this? Because trying to conceive after miscarriage(s) just brings you down physically and mentally to the point that it taints everything around you in the saddest way. When I made the decision to do IVF, it was after I told my husband that we were done after this, no matter what the outcome - I will finally stop hating my body for not being able to do what it is supposed to do. </p>

<p>So now, no matter what happens: we&#39;ll have tried it all. 11 chances and then, that is it that is all!</p>

<p>It&#39;s strangely a relief to see the light at the end of the tunnel, no matter what the outcome. </p>

So, second friend at work getting pregnant in these three months since my loss. YAY! \(sorry about that\) 

I mean, I'm happy for them, but jeez, give me a break! I was definitely feeling better for the last two weeks after having a hard time when the other friend had her first ultrasound. We take transit together, we sit together at lunch. Now the two of them have a baby growing inside and I have nothing. Well, no nothing, cramps and cramps almost everyday of the cycle, without any explanation for now.

Maybe time to look for another job?

Husband and I tried for a year and a half to get pregnant. It was a rough pregnancy from the start. I bled on the day my period was supposed to come and didn't test until a few days later when my period wasn't as heavy as usual. I then had another bleed on week 7. I had an ultrasound and everything was fine, except for a UTI and a BV. Took some antibiotics for those. At our NT scan everything with the baby was perfect, but they found a large SCH. My doctor wasn't concerned though, just put me on pelvic rest and gave me the rhogam shot. 

I had another ultrasound two weeks later and the SCH was getting smaller. Everyone was pleased. I spotted here and there, but was told everything is fine and it's probably the hematoma. I started to get excited around week 16.. went on a baby moon and announced at my work and to friends. We wanted to wait and find out the gender, but I had a feeling we're having a boy. Everything was perfect. Until one night I started getting some intense cramps that will come and go. They woke me up and couldn't sleep for a few hours. I got up and started moving and they disappeared.

Then the next day I had another bleed (week 19) and decided to go to the ER. I was checked out there: no vaginal infections, baby was healthy and moving. Got a little clip of him grabbing his toes. They checked my cervix with an abdominal ultrasound and pelvic exam and everything was fine. They sent me home and told me to watch for more bleeding (1 pad an hour). As soon as I went home those cramps started again, but I didn't want to look stupid and go back to the ER. I waited a few hours and then I started hemorrhaging. We rushed to the ER and the doc there told us I was already 4 cm dilated and there's nothing they can do. I was (am) devasted. I asked for them to stop the labor or get a cerclage, but I guess those weren't an option considering how far dilated I was and the intense bleeding. My boy was born on March 16. I felt him move until the end. He was so tiny and perfect.

I am so so sad. I've never been this heartbroken in my life. My heart physically hurts still. It's getting easier to manage now, but God damn. Nothing is exciting and I'm not looking forward to pretty much anything. 

I'm gonna wrap it up here as this is getting so long. I met with a MFM doctor at a large women's hospital in the area. We had sent the placenta for a pathology test and they found I had an infection in the membranes. The MFM doc thinks my hematoma was a catalyst for bacteria and since my cervix wasn't closed all the way because of the bleeding, it allowed the infection to set in. Even though I had no UTI or BV at the ER the day before. It was a true preterm labor, she said. She suggested we wait 6 months to TTC again because my risk of preterm labor is already increased and pregnancies close together increase that chance again. Does that sound right? 

So here we are now. Waiting for August to roll around. This community has been so helpful. All of your stories give me hope ❤️ Especially, the success stories.

I'm pretty new at my job but I explained my absences to my team, but not really anyone else. Its none of their business. I only missed one day and that for my D&C. My heart was seriously broken. This was not what I wanted for my husband and I (obviously) but after losing my Mom in December I really really wanted a fresh start. It doesn't matter how old I am but I am turning 30 years old in August, I have been with my husband for 10 years and we just celebrated our 2 year wedding anniversary. I consider us in a good situation for a kid, since we are debt free and both have stable jobs AND side hustles. WE PLANNED IT THAT WAY. 

The other day I was at work and a fellow co-worker was super excited to get her 3 year old a hot wheels car. I told her that I too always wanted one of those growing up and that I planned on getting on for my FUTURE kid. We proceeded to talk about it and I said, ""I want to get a G-Wagon or a Hummer! They are soo cute"" Then I pulled one up on the internet. A intern who wasn't involved in the conversation butted in and said, ""They have weight-limit, I don't think you can drive one! (Haha!)"". I said, ""Oh its not for me! Its for my future kid!"" Then she proceeded to say, ""Oh sweetheart, I don't think you need to be thinking of that right now."" 

At first I was little peeved but I leveled myself out because, she doesn't know how offensive it is OR what I have been through. THEN THIS HAPPENED TODAY! 

Another co-worker said his wife wanted pizza for dinner, he has a coupon for a place, but its dine-in only and his wife didn't want to dine-in/go out for pizza. I said, ""Why! Its pizza!!""

I had a MMC and a D&amp;C at 11.5 weeks on March 12th this year. I&#39;m pretty new at my job but I explained my absences to my team, but not really anyone else. Its none of their business. I only missed one day and that for my D&amp;C. My heart was seriously broken. This was not what I wanted for my husband and I (obviously) but after losing my Mom in December I really really wanted a fresh start. It doesn&#39;t matter how old I am but I am turning 30 years old in August, I have been with my husband for 10 years and we just celebrated our 2 year wedding anniversary. I consider us in a good situation for a kid, since we are debt free and both have stable jobs AND side hustles. WE PLANNED IT THAT WAY. </p>

<p>The other day I was at work and a fellow co-worker was super excited to get her 3 year old a hot wheels car. I told her that I too always wanted one of those growing up and that I planned on getting on for my FUTURE kid. We proceeded to talk about it and I said, &quot;I want to get a G-Wagon or a Hummer! They are soo cute&quot; Then I pulled one up on the internet. A intern who wasn&#39;t involved in the conversation butted in and said, &quot;They have weight-limit, I don&#39;t think you can drive one! (Haha!)&quot;. I said, &quot;Oh its not for me! Its for my future kid!&quot; Then she proceeded to say, &quot;Oh sweetheart, I don&#39;t think you need to be thinking of that right now.&quot; </p>

<p>At first I was little peeved but I leveled myself out because, she doesn&#39;t know how offensive it is OR what I have been through. THEN THIS HAPPENED TODAY! </p>

<p>Another co-worker said his wife wanted pizza for dinner, he has a coupon for a place, but its dine-in only and his wife didn&#39;t want to dine-in/go out for pizza. I said, &quot;Why! Its pizza!!&quot; Then he said, &quot;We have a 3-year-old!&quot; I laughed and said, &quot;Turn on the tv and lock the door!&quot; We both laughed about it.

Just wanted to introduce myself. Not sure if I'm really in the TTC category yet, but we're considering what we want to do. 

After a couple years of trying on and off, we finally conceived on our first round of clomid in January. The pregnancy was rough from the beginning. I had a subchorionic hemorrhage at 7 weeks that was terrifying as I thought I was miscarrying, but we were able to see the heartbeat at the hospital and a checkup the following week was fine. Then at 12 weeks, NT measured thick, so I had a CVS done. This caused more bleeding, but results came back great. No genetic or chromosomal abnormalities were found, and we found out we were having a little boy. 16 week checkup went perfectly, and we heard the heartbeat for the first time. 4 days later, I got sick. I woke up that morning with a fever of 103 and was shivering so bad I was practically convulsing. We called an ambulance, but by the time they got there, the shivering had subsided, and I decided to wait and call my OB when they opened in a couple hours. My fever broke shortly after, and the OB nurse said I should be fine, but if my fever came back and wasn't controlled with tylenol to go to the ER.

Sure enough, it came back. On and off all day, it would spike to 103, drop back down, then shoot back up. We finally went to the ER that night. They couldn't find anything wrong with me. They did every test imaginable, including a spinal tap to check for meningitis. All tests came back normal. Around 4am, we got back home, and I'd started spotting. We'd been up for 24 hours at this point and the hospital was an hour away, so we decided to wait until the OB's office opened again. It was light and I wasn't cramping. We called a few hours later, and they told us to go back to the ER. Went back and they found the baby's heartbeat and did an ultrasound. Everything looked fine, and they couldn't find a source of the bleeding. They said it was probably from the hemorrhage and told me to follow up with OB next week (this was a Thursday).

The weekend was rough. I had developed a spinal headache from the spinal tap and was completely miserable. On Tuesday, I went in for my appointment. I chatted with the ultrasound tech for a few minutes about how we knew it was a boy and were so excited. Then she started the ultrasound. He wasn't moving at all. The tech didn't say anything for a couple minutes until I said something about him not moving. She then tried to find the heartbeat, and it wasn't there. I think this moment was the worst moment of my life. Looking at my baby on the screen and knowing he was gone. That image haunts me. The rest of the day is a blur now. We went straight to the hospital for an induction. They said it could take 6-24 hours, but it only took one (I think, in hindsight, I'd been in labor for about a day with back cramps, and spotting on Monday that I thought was strangely mucousy was either amniotic fluid or the plug). I delivered while they were inserting the epidural, and it was so unexpected that they didn't even have a doctor in there. I had to lay there for a few minutes to wait for the doctor to cut the cord.

I won't go into details on the rest. It was very emotional, and this is already longer than I intended, but we did get to hold him and they let us keep him in the room that night. Those moments of holding him were heartbreaking but also so precious to me now. My recovery has been tough, but I'm incredibly lucky to work for a company that gave me the first week off as bereavement and 2 additional paid weeks. I'm back into the swing of things now and am trying to think about the future, which is so ridiculously hard. I think I'm either about to start to my period or actually ovulated on my own (I normally don't), which has made me start thinking about if I should just jump back in and start clomid when my period comes. Since I've started thinking about it, I've begun having nightmares about dead children, so I'm probably not ready. But I also don't want to wait. I'm 31, and we want more than one, and who knows what will happen next time. As of right now, I think we'll try an unmedicated cycle and see what happens, but I may change my mind tomorrow.

We're going in a couple days to review the autopsy results with a specialist. We've already discussed them with my regular OB (big surprise, everything came back normal), so this is more an appointment to advise future pregnancies. As of right now, it seems this was just horrible luck with some kind of virus and not something that is likely to happen again.",t2_xsi5s,False,,0,False,Intro Post (2nd trimester loss),[],r/ttcafterloss,False,0,intro,0,,,False,t3_8n0elf,False,dark,1.0,,public,16,0,{},,ce4ab51a-711f-11e4-826c-12313d148545,False,[],,False,False,,{},Intro,False,16,,False,self,False,,[],{},,True,,1527639754.0,text,0,,,text,self.ttcafterloss,True,"<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=""md""><p>Hi everyone,</p>

Everything looked fine, and they couldn&#39;t find a source of the bleeding. They said it was probably from the hemorrhage and told me to follow up with OB next week (this was a Thursday).</p>

<p>The weekend was rough. I had developed a spinal headache from the spinal tap and was completely miserable. On Tuesday, I went in for my appointment. I chatted with the ultrasound tech for a few minutes about how we knew it was a boy and were so excited. Then she started the ultrasound. He wasn&#39;t moving at all. The tech didn&#39;t say anything for a couple minutes until I said something about him not moving. She then tried to find the heartbeat, and it wasn&#39;t there. I think this moment was the worst moment of my life. Looking at my baby on the screen and knowing he was gone. That image haunts me. The rest of the day is a blur now. We went straight to the hospital for an induction. They said it could take 6-24 hours, but it only took one (I think, in hindsight, I&#39;d been in labor for about a day with back cramps, and spotting on Monday that I thought was strangely mucousy was either amniotic fluid or the plug). I delivered while they were inserting the epidural, and it was so unexpected that they didn&#39;t even have a doctor in there. I had to lay there for a few minutes to wait for the doctor to cut the cord.</p>

<p>I won&#39;t go into details on the rest. It was very emotional, and this is already longer than I intended, but we did get to hold him and they let us keep him in the room that night. Those moments of holding him were heartbreaking but also so precious to me now. My recovery has been tough, but I&#39;m incredibly lucky to work for a company that gave me the first week off as bereavement and 2 additional paid weeks. I&#39;m back into the swing of things now and am trying to think about the future, which is so ridiculously hard. I think I&#39;m either about to start to my period or actually ovulated on my own (I normally don&#39;t), which has made me start thinking about if I should just jump back in and start clomid when my period comes. Since I&#39;ve started thinking about it, I&#39;ve begun having nightmares about dead children, so I&#39;m probably not ready. But I also don&#39;t want to wait. I&#39;m 31, and we want more than one, and who knows what will happen next time. As of right now, I think we&#39;ll try an unmedicated cycle and see what happens, but I may change my mind tomorrow.</p>

<p>We&#39;re going in a couple days to review the autopsy results with a specialist. We&#39;ve already discussed them with my regular OB (big surprise, everything came back normal), so this is more an appointment to advise future pregnancies. As of right now, it seems this was just horrible luck with some kind of virus and not something that is likely to happen again.</p>

Previously our RE said IUI wouldn’t do any good cause we were getting pregnant just losing early on; so IVF with genetic testing would be our next option. Well we don’t have that kind of money. 

My period started today. I was so optimistic our “last” cycle would be successful. I have been crying and soothe shopping all morning.

<p>Yesterday evening I got some mild cramping. Took some ibuprofen and was fine. It woke me up last night and I was able to get through it. Now it has escalated to moderate cramps. (Mild= meds work, Moderate= meds help but I lay down with a heating pad, Severe= writhing in pain.)</p>

<p>I’m really wondering what could be going on.</p>

<ul>
<li><em>W0</em> - D&amp;C; hCG  57,645; bled for 4 days then nothing.</li>
<li><em>W1</em> - hCG  1,058; Started bleeding on day 4.</li>
<li><em>W2</em> - hCG 356;  Stopped bleeding from previous week on day 2, spotted all week.</li>
<li><em>W3</em> -  hCG 179; </li>
<li><em>W4</em> - hCG 74; </li>
<li><em>W5</em> - hCG 27; bled 2 days</li>
<li><em>W6</em> - Stopped bleeding from previous week on day 2; very light spotting returned; cramping began on day 5.</li>
<li>I don’t have a fever.</li>

<p>What could be the matter? All Dr Google has is links to BabyCenter forum posts. I don’t know if that was a period last week, but even if it was having cramps days after is weird.</p>

We went in this past Friday for our NT screen at 12+6 (after a lot of stress getting it scheduled and rescheduled due to business travel and tech availability). Ended up going to an independent (boutique) ultrasound place since they were the only ones with availability. We were pretty excited since those places usually do special pictures in 3D and stuff that my normal office doesn’t. Still had my usual symptoms though nausea had decreased, which I had expected (hoped for) since we were entering the second trimester. 

Within moments the tech told us she couldn’t find a heartbeat and was going to call a doctor to review. As our hearts were breaking, several people came in to figure out how to put the doctor on speakerphone in the room, since he wasn't in the office, then left awkwardly. Some complete stranger that I’ve never seen or heard of told us the official news. I called my OB, totally lost as to what to do, and the unhelpful front desk woman had zero sympathy. She said something like, ""oh okay, what do you want to do? I guess you can leave a message with the doctor?""

We found out the gender a few weeks ago after NIPT came back clear. I thought we were safe and I feel so stupid about that now. We had just announced to family and friends on Mother’s Day. It took us months to get here and now everything is over after my D&C yesterday. Some of the staff was great, some were shitty. They made me ""describe in my own words"" what the procedure was for. 

The original doctor from the boutique said it looked like it was measuring about a week behind, but it had been measuring progressively ahead for my past few appointments (I'm inherently high risk as a type 1 diabetic and therefore have more frequent appointments). The last ultrasound we had on May 2, I should have been 10+4 but it was measuring 11w. The heart rate was 163 that day. Before that, on 4/27 I would've been 9+6 and it was measuring 10w (only 1 day off) so they let me do the NIPT that day. I feel like the timeline is confusing and just want to know when it happened, even though it won't make any difference or help me feel any better. Was it when I flew out for my business trip last Monday? Did it happen before we even announced?

Whether you're TTC or planning to TTC later or thinking of adopting, how do you factor those future, hypothetical children into your current planning? What do you do with small-scale decisions: do I buy these expensive tickets for that vacation 12 months from now when there's a possibility I might be pregnant by then? do I go ahead and redecorate the room that was supposed to be the nursery? And what about large-scale decisions--should I take a job closer to family so that childcare will be easier to come by? should I take this more ambitious position at work that's less compatible with being a parent?

There were only a few people we told after the fact. From the beginning, we were open about the cause of our loss - most people got a text saying that the baby would not make it due to a genetic condition. If people had questions, which we encouraged, we were happy to answer them - I want people to be aware of the variety of genetic tests you can have done in early pregnancy, and I also just wanted people to remember our child and know that it was real and why this happened. We told only our very close friends and our parents about actually making the decision to terminate though. If people asked flat-out if we terminated, I said yes - if anyone had an issue with it (no one did), I would have reconsidered my friendship at the point. However, our friends could not have been more supportive throughout this entire ordeal. We received flowers, notes, fruit arrangements, meals, ice cream, gift cards, etc. Each text and card and delivery made us cry that our friends were this caring and thoughtful, and I'll remember those gestures for the rest of my life. 

When we told our respective moms about the termination, they had different reactions than our friends. My mom offered to tell the rest of the family and immediately said ""I'll just tell them you had a miscarriage since that's easier."" I told her not to say that, since that wasn't the narrative - that isn't what happened, but I appreciated her letting the rest of the family know. I asked for her to be informative and provide the trisomy number in case people wanted to do some research. She wound up telling both sides of the family that ""There have been some complications with the pregnancy that indicate she won't be able to carry to term."" I found this out and was extremely frustrated because that *doesn't even indicate we had a loss* - talk about vague. I gave everyone the right information and encouraged questions, and basically walked back a lot of the stuff she told everyone. An annoying thing to deal with while you're also coping with the loss of your child. I thought that this would be the worst reaction we'd have to deal with. However..

This weekend, we got together with my husband's side of the family for a belated Mother's Day gathering (ugh). My husband's grandmother had a seven-month loss due to chromosomal abnormalities back in the 60s, so she and her husband might be the only people in either of our families who actually know what we're feeling right now. She was also the only person besides a cousin who wished me a happy Mother's Day - neither my mom or MIL acknowledged whatsoever. My husband was talking with her and she said ""We've been thinking about you every day, I wanted to send you a white azalea but MIL had told us we weren't allowed to contact you."" *screeeeeech* what? Not once did we say this, she just took it upon herself to email all the family members and forbade them to talk to us about the loss. I don't have the actual email so I don't know what was said, but there's not many ways to say ""you can't talk to them"" without actually saying those words. It breaks my heart that there were supportive family members on this side that were too afraid to say anything because my MIL bullied them into not contacting us about our loss. His grandmother was livid so I wouldn't be surprised if this was not the end of it..

For any future pregnancies, I'm thinking we only tell our friends and wait to tell our families (specifically parents). Can we do that?? It kills me because both of our dads didn't do anything at all and would be so excited about another pregnancy - it feels mean to exclude them but there's no way to keep that a secret from their wives. Has anyone dealt with family just completely bungling their losses and do you have any suggestions on what to do in the future so this doesn't happen again?

On May 8, our ultrasound told us (at 7+5) that the gestational sac was in my lower cervix and measuring at 5-6 weeks. I had minor brown spotting when I peed the Wed-Sat before that, and at one point had reddish mucous discharge, but it was super small and they told me not to worry (we had just had sex, so I assumed it was spotting and discharge). On the 8th, my Beta levels were at 24, and they were down to 13 on Thursday the 10th. They expected them to continue to drop but I didn't ask me to get anymore blood work. 

I still haven't passed anything. They said I may pass it, my body may absorb it, or it may pass with my next period. This might sound crazy, but Thursday when I spotted, I didn't ""Feel"" pregnant anymore. I kind of just, knew, I think. After the hospital I cried, for probably a week straight. Then I got angry, like we're talking hulk angry, and I am NOT an angry person, ever. I remember wanting to rip my steering wheel off my car at one point. Then, all of a sudden on Thursday, I just felt like me again. I am not sure if this is a sign that I absorbed it fully, or I am just telling myself this. 

So my question, where do I go from here? I started temping again last week, and they're about 97.1-97.5 (my line is usually around 97.2-97.3). But, I have heard temps are usually crazy after miscarriages. I did an OPK test Thursday and I got a faint line, but nothing major and I dont really want to waste my strips if nothing is going to happen.
My cycle is usually 35-40 days, but should I expect it roughly 35 days from the 5-6 week mark of when the baby stopped growing, or from the day I actually pass the miscarriage (which might not even happen?). I am so confused. I just want to actually start TTC again :( 

Our dr said we could ttc right away, but recommended waiting a cycle so we had a LKP and if we needed time to heal emotionally.

After my loss, I struggled to get my Asherman's Syndrome diagnosed and surgically repaired, and during this whole time I have been understandably upset, angry, anxious, ect; and one of the ways I made myself feel better was with food. I thought ""Hey, I just went through some terrible shit, I deserve to eat the food I want."" and in doing so, I have gained about 20 pounds in 7 months. 

Years ago I went on a dangerous crash diet involving boxed shakes and nothing else (literally, no other food) for 6 weeks. I lost 40 pounds in 6 weeks, but completely destroyed my metabolism in the process. Since then, if I ever wanted to lose weight I had put on, I would HAVE to really restrict and work out all the time to lose any weight. Moderation does not work for my body anymore. 

My question is, can I possibly lose the weight I've gained since my loss? I've been told that if you start a strict diet and begin a new exercise routine, your body won't allow a pregnancy because it thinks you're starving/in trouble. Does anyone know if there's truth to this? I would much rather become pregnant again than lose this weight, but I was wondering if there's a way I could do both, maybe. 

Thanks!

My wife had a d&c back on 2/28. On 4/13 she got her period and it was quite heavy. This month, she hasnt felt any cramps or anything, but has had very light spotting for the past 4-5 days. 

The doc says to wait another cycle, but were trying to figure out if this is even a period? Should we be concerned?

Since then we have done everything we could think of to get back to life again. We travel, we eat healthy, we joke and we laugh. We go to her grave every Sunday and we are not afraid of talking about how much we miss her, how great she was and we do proudly think of ourselves as parents. 

It has been a long, very hard and painful year. We struggled to get pregnant in the first place and because we both are older (m 39, f 41) the whole pregnancy was a long beautiful but scary time. We were so happy that we made it to the end and was about to have the long-awaited family. My wife is the most perfect mother, I find children to be the meaning of life and have always looked forward to being a father. 

We got married and bought a house, I built a crib and we visited all friends with babies to learn about different ways of being a parent. We were in heaven and 365 days ago we fell down from there to what is best described as limbo, others might call it hell. Unscrewing the baby crib again and putting it in the basement was one of the most difficult things I've endured, but then again those days were just a torrent of ""most difficult thing ever..."".

We are back to trying again, month after month. We eat medicines, take temperature, stay positive and most importantly try to add love and happiness to our lives. But nothing seems to work and looking around all I hear are sad stories and people trying to comfort us explaining how life without kids is also great, while their toddlers are crawling around their legs... 

Where can I find the 40+ that managed to get pregnant, that have stories with happy endings, that can give us hope and spirit back? I'm starving to be convinced that yes, it will happen...I don't care for realism, I want to believe that it will happen!

And no, this is not a throw-away account because I'm proud of what I have gone through and still able to keep my s**t together. But I wish there was hotline to the almighty so that I could call and say ""please, enough... let us please get what we so much want"".

Im a super goal oriented person. Setting goals, making plans and acheiving them is like a high for me. After we miscarried I did what I usually do to help me get through. I made a list of what I wanted to accomplish before I was able to get pregnant again. Some were body goals that I couldnt control like stop bleeding, normal hormones and first period. They were more just like a checklist so I could see I was progressing. The other list was goals i could control - lose some weight, buy a bigger bed etc. I miscarried February 5th. Ive since accomplished all of the goals I set. Why do I still feel stuck. Why cant I stop thinking about the baby and feeling sorry for myself? Whats stopping me from moving on?

Then the other day I realized that all of my goals that i set, though the goals were fine, the reason I set those goals was not helping me. Everything was to help us prepare for being pregnant or having a baby -lose weight for a healthier pregnancy, buy a bigger bed to sleep better when pregnant etc etc. Everything i was working towards was still revolving around this baby so every time I got a BFN or something else happened that discouraged me it felt like my whole world was crashing because in a sense thats all I was working towards. 

Finally I started to ask myself ""besides baby what else do I want""? Who do I want to be besides a mom because even when I have this baby I do not want to be defined solely as a mother. I need goals just for me so my whole world doesnt revolve around baby or no baby.

So what I realized that seems to be helping me and maybe will help you too is that I want to be a whole woman before and after this baby. Other than motherhood what do I want to define me and my life? What can I work at thats just mine because I cant control when the next baby comes and if everything I am is waiting for a baby Im going to keep being miserable about something I have no control over.",t2_kqs7nky,False,,0,False,My Revelation,[],r/ttcafterloss,False,0,,0,,,False,t3_8jdzxi,False,dark,0.97,,public,38,0,{},,,False,[],,False,False,,{},,False,38,,False,self,False,,[],{},,True,,1526346726.0,text,0,,,text,self.ttcafterloss,False,"<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=""md""><p>I had a bit of a revelation I wanted to share here in case it might help someone else. </p>
