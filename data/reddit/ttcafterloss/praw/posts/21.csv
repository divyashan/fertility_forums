2,2048,confidence,<praw.reddit.Reddit object at 0x7f12a630cd90>,,ttcafterloss,"Here's the thing: I have a healthy and happy and perfect son who just turned 2. I got pregnant on birth control on my honeymoon. The pregnancy was super easy aside from braxton hicks every day. I had an IUD inserted when he was 6 weeks old. Just after his first birthday, I had it removed to start trying for our second child. I got pregnant right away. We went on vacation and on our last day, I started spotting. My husband and brother in law (both physicians) assured me it was normal in the first trimester. I just so happened to have my first 9 week ultrasound scheduled the day after we got back from vacation. The baby looked healthy and the heartbeat was strong. They said I only had a 5% change of miscarrying since we saw a good strong heartbeat. I went in a couple days later and the bleeding site as shrinking and the heartbeat was still good. The bleeding stopped for a couple days and then when it started again, they had me come in right away for another ultrasound. No cardiac activity. The baby stopped growing just days after we saw the good strong heartbeat. I had a D&amp;C at the end of July 2015. I had a period in August and got pregnant again in September. We did an early ultrasound (at a high risk OB office with very high grade equipment) where there was a sac but no baby around 6 weeks. I had another D&amp;C at the end of October 2015. My regular OB then did the Anticardiolipid, Lupus anticoagulant profile and thyroid test. All came back normal. 

I wanted a break from all of this and decided to try to track my ovulation with a period app and not have sex during my fertile time. We had sex 2 days after my period, right before New Years and somehow conceived. I called my OB the minute I found out and started doing progesterone suppositories right away. She never tested my progesterone levels but said she would do this regardless of what they were, so we did it. I go to my 9 week ultrasound (I had NO bleeding and was sure this pregnancy would take since I was so much more symptomatic) and the baby was measuring 9w4d with no cardiac activity. Again. I had a 3rd D&amp;C on March 3rd. My pregnancy test at my 2 week post opp was positive so they have been tracking my HCG levels until they go down to 0. It's now been a month and they are still at 30. Doing another draw next week. This never happened in my other two miscarriages. 

After this 3rd D&amp;C, they sent the tissue to a lab for chromosomal karyotyping. The baby tested positive for Turner's syndrome, which is one of the leading causes of miscarriages. Nothing came back as being wrong with my husband or I. So now I have an appointment with a RE this coming Thursday. My husband is a physician so I kind of know what to expect, but I'm wondering if anyone here has been in a situation like this? Perfectly normal pregnancy and then....this. I know I am lucky in that I seem to get pregnant very easily and that's why I don't want to step on anyone's toes here because I know you may be going through similar frustrations, and please know I am so sorry for your struggles and I don't want to seem insensitive. I just have never known anyone to have this problem after a totally normal pregnancy before and I just had to reach out somewhere because I'm feeling very alone in this RPL world.

UPDATE: Just wanted to post an update after meeting with the RE. It went as expected. He ordered a battery of blood tests for myself and my husband including chromosome karyotyype, AMH, and some others. After my next period, I will have a saline hysterscopy to see if there is any scar tissue from the 3 D&amp;Cs, leftover tissue or structural abnormalities. And then we go from there depending on how things come back. I'm a little nervous that he's quick to push IVF and that scares me. I know it's a huge money maker for them, but I just got the feeling that he pushes that as opposed to trying on our own with maybe some help from medication...I don't know. I'm a little bummed I have to wait until my next period to find out any answers but there's not much I can do about that.  

Second UPDATE: So I wanted to give an update on my appointment today with my reproductive endocrinologist. My blood work has all been normal and great. My egg count is great. John and I are both chromosomally fine. He did a saline ultrasound and went into my uterus with a camera and said everything looks great except for 3 very small polyps and one larger flat one that was covering a large part of one uterine wall. If my 3 babies had tried implanting there, it wouldn't be sustainable with life and therefore miscarried. We have an answer for my last loss (Turner's syndrome), but this could very well explain the other two. So now I have to have a surgery much like a D&C. It's general anesthesia and they'll dilate my cervix, go in with a camera and take out the polyps. Then we are free to try on our own again! As annoying as it is to have to have surgery and deal with help with my 2 yr old and someone driving me, I'm really happy with this result. Yay! ☺️",t2_5d6nt,False,,0,False,New here - RPL Intro.

I'm not even sure who or how many in this community will remember me at this point.  As it turns out, after a loss most people who aren't also infertile get pregnant and get to move from this sad but wonderful place after a year.  But here I am.  

In case you need to get caught up, I got pregnant in May of 2014 after two months of oral meds/IUI with a baby boy, Ethan.  My cervix is literally incompetent at its one job, and Ethan was born and died on October 5, 2014.  We were cleared to begin treatment again in January of 2015.  In the intervening year, however, I wound up having three ectopic pregnancies - one of which happened spontaneously without any meds or IUI while we were waiting to start IVF back in December.  Each ectopic gutted me worse than the last, and by this past fall (before the third one even happened), I needed a break from this place.  Too many of you were finding ways to thankfully move on with your grief, and it was painful feeling broken and left behind.  

We finally began IVF injections this week.  Today is Day 3. Our IVF protocol is going to be a bit different than most, though, since this last ectopic wrecked my tubes even though we were able to resolve it with methotrexate.  I'll hopefully have an egg retrieval within the next two weeks, and then there will be a month ""break"" during which I'll have a salpingectomy. After recovering from that, we'll be able to prep for a frozen embryo transfer, which I'm hopeful will happen by my birthday (the 5th of July :).  For now, we've gotta stay hopeful and take it one day at a time.  My first monitoring appointment is tomorrow, and I'm trying to stay upbeat with stupid Band-Aids:

This isn't exactly something new I've noticed, it just kind of hit me that what if we all stopped doing it? What if we speak up? And what if it became a project we all worked on?

Why would we do this? Because it's not ok for us to fear going places and seeing people because someone you know is insensitive will be there. Because our feelings and thoughts and emotions of grief and sadness and despair are just as real as their happiness and overwhelmingly sickening positivity.
Society teaches us that being a minority means silence, disconnection and that you don't matter as much as other people. It also teaches us that bringing conversation down is a bad thing to do, that keeping the peace is more important than your own peace. It teaches us that to do otherwise is selfish. And isn't that how it feels some of time? 
Well I am sick of running to the nearest bathroom to cry, sick of taking makeup with me when I go out just in case, sick of sitting in silence while people forget or don't care or think it's ok to talk about baby-related life events. Our energy needs to be focused on ourselves and our partners, we need the energy that is so quickly used when we have to sit through this sort of thing, we need it to get better.
So I want to set a challenge for everyone here and hope it spreads. Speak up next time something hurts.

I've been enjoying my break from TTC subs the past few weeks. I no longer constantly obsessed about it and could sort of focus on other things in my life. CDs snuck up on me and I almost forgot to start OPKs. My thermometer proved it was actually a PoS so I switched back to my old one, and back to orally.

I initially didn't want to try this cycle because we were stressed and didn't want a Christmas due date, but we both changed our minds. We agreed to do it as low key as possible though, so if we mess up we won't be distraught. 

The 2 cycles I've tracked since my MC I ovulated late on CD 19 and 25. This cycle I drank raspberry leaf tea every morning. I'm fairly certain I just missed my LH peak so there was likely a +OPK in there I missed. That means I *should* ovulate tomorrow?? If so, it will be CD 18 so at least it isn't going longer! 

I've had almost no EWCM since my MC, so I researched briefly ways to increase it. Grapefruit juice came up, so I bought some. Yesterday I come home, pour a glass, take an OPK. On my drive home I was feeling like I wanted some action that night, and when I saw a very dark (but still negative) OPK, I knew it was on. 

I'm able to relax and enjoy sex more after 1-2 drinks, so I take my juice into the kitchen to spike it. First ice, but what comes out of the ice dispenser is actually something much bigger. A bottle had plopped into my juice; a flavored vodka sampler we'd had in the fridge since Thanksgiving. I find this hilarious and take pics to send to DH, must be a sign! I fish it out and find it's GRAPEFRUIT FLAVORED. OMG GOD IS SPEAKING TO ME. We did it that night, but I didn't tell DH it was because the OPK was almost positive, I didn't want him to feel pressured.

For months I've been plagued with a difficulty breathing that got worse when I laid down. It's triggered many a panic attack. I had a big on Sunday night after we went to bed. I was sobbing and flailing and thrashing when DH tried to get me to lay down. After the attack ended, I tried to go to sleep but I still couldn't breathe well.

Suddenly I cough once, and feel mucous immediately slide down my throat. I sat up in bed for a bit and felt better enough to sleep.

The next day I felt great!! I could breathe so well! It was easy! I could take deep breaths with ease. I felt awesome, and it was during this awesome time I got my almost +opk and sign to drink. It felt like my body was getting it's act together finally.

Today I feel like I'm struggling a little to get a deep breath again :( I'm wondering if I may have asthma??

Last night my phone suddenly turned off and wouldn't boot up past the LG screen. Apparently this is a known issue for my phone, so I'll have to find my receipt somehow and send it back to LG. I'll be without it for 9-10 days, so I need to figure out what to do in the mean time. Work was soooo boring without my phone. And I can't make a doctor appointment without it.

We've been going back and forth for weeks about what to do about a vacation. We were thinking of going with my mom to her home country and had a fight about my MIL coming etc. But now we aren't going at all. We looked at pretty nice and elaborate cruise to Alaska or Europe, but it was so expensive to fly there. We ""settled"" on a cruise from FL, but it's 7 days on a big new ship and we're getting  balcony! Probably booking tonight :)

Ok, I feel like I got some stuff off my chest :) If I'm really about to ovulate, I think I should continue staying away during the TWW to reduce stress and symptom spotting.

Up until last week at 25 weeks pregnant (Wednesday the 16) my pregnancy was normal, a dream pregnancy actually. I had morning sickness for a week or two, never puked, had only a few aversions, and by the second tri I felt pretty much normal. Last Tuesday night I noticed a decrease in movement but with it being so early on I figured the baby was sleeping or moving and I just wasn't feeling it. The next morning I started to freak out - I went to work but left at 10:30 when my husband came to get me. We went right to the doctors and they searched for a heart beat and couldn't find one with a doppler or portable US machine. They sent us to the hospital to confirm the loss and that's when we knew for sure we had lost the baby. We actually learned the sex that day too since we were waiting until the birth to find out. It was a girl and my husband and I were devastated. He had a feeling all along it was a girl and he wanted a little girl so badly, as did I. We had the name Emma Kate picked out for her and that's what we would call her from then on. We went home to make some calls and spend one more night at home and checked into the hospital on Thursday. They began induction with misoprostal. I think they gave me 400mgs? Not sure but it was a good amount, and they put it in my cervix. I had about 4 rounds, and by the last round it was early Friday morning and I had spiked a fever from the meds. It also gave me extreme GI issues. Once it wore off I made sure to not have any more of it and they put me on pitocin. Once that started up it wasn't long before Emma came out. Thinking about that moment makes my heart race - I yelled and cried, my husband cried, and there was just lots of combination. She was put on my chest right away but the placenta wouldn't budge so I was scared to hold her while they were trying tot get me to birth it. Finally the decided I needed a D&C to get it out so they wheeled me away and left my husband with Emma. Once that was over and I was back, I was able to hold her for real. for about 6 hours we held her. We had our families come up and meet her and had the priest baptize her and bless us. We held her some more then it was time to say goodbye. We were told how much she would change from that night until the morning and we were scared to see her change. We gave one last goodbye and they took her away and we went to bed. It was hard to leave the hospital the next day, I hated leaving her there, leaving without a baby, going home to resume life. I wanted to stay there forever and not keep going further...I wanted time to stand still and still do. It's not fair that we have to go on and the days and months go on and Emma's not here. It will be one week tomorrow and soon it will be one month and 2 months...and so on. Her due date was June 25...we were going to have such a fun summer!

I'm using the Clear Blue Easy digital tests - where you put a little stick inside a reader and it displays either a circle (not ovulating), a flashing smiley (high fertility), or a solid smiley (peak fertility).

CD14 I got a flashing smiley which seemed right.  But CD15 and CD16 (today) are also flashing smileys.  I figured I should get a solid smiley 1-2 days after the flashing one. 

I'm simultaneously using the CVS store brand strips. There are just strips (not even in a plastic holder) that you dip in your urine.  The test line on that started off light but has been consistently darker than the control line for the past few days, starting at CD 13.

I also had egg white mucus CD 12-13.

How do I figure out what my actual ovulation day is (or was)?

58,2048,confidence,<praw.reddit.Reddit object at 0x7f12a630cd90>,,ttcafterloss,"Hello, I just found this sub, and I'm glad I did! It sucks so hard that such a thing has to exist. But anyway. My husband and I have a 2.5 year old son. We were trying for about a year to conceive when we found out January 8th that we were finally pregnant! I was so over the moon. My husband was too! We dreamed of our son finally becoming a great older brother, my husband would rub my belly and say, ""I can't wait to see your big pregnant belly again!"" I wasn't sure about the dating of the pregnancy, so I went in for a quant blood test, as that was the recommended starting point from the Dr's office. 

When the first results seemed low, they had me come back. When the increase in hcg wasn't high enough to their liking, I went in for an ultrasound. Everything looked, ""Perfect! Exactly what we want to see at this point,"" said the doctor. Phwew! Sweet relief. 

So a week goes by, and I'm feeling tired, my boobs feel more sore, I feel pregnant. There's some light cramping here and there, but that felt normal also. Then, on Sunday, January 31, I had some bleeding. It was brown though, so I didn't want to worry that much, as I was aware implantation bleeding discharge could happen. I called Monday morning to make an appointment, and was able to schedule one for the next day. Tuesday morning, I go in for the appointment. The scheduler messed up and scheduled me for Wednesday. I threw a huge fit and demanded to be seen. My doctor, being the wonderful lady she is, made room to see me. The ultrasound showed the brightest little fluttering thing! ""There's your baby, and there's your heartbeat! Everything looks perfect!"" I was about 6weeks6days

Phwew! Even more relief. I had a picture in hand, PROOF that I was pregnant. Elated, I told several friends, coworkers, family members, etc. the great news. Everyone was so excited for us, especially my son. He talked about how he was going to be a big brother and help mommy take care of the baby. 

The following day, I go about preschool drop-off, work, lunch, more work as usual. I notice an increase in bleeding. This time it's red. I call the Dr's office again. I'm so tired of calling that number by this point. They tell me to come in the morning. I get an official ultrasound in the radiology building. The radiologist goes about the usual procedure, without saying a word. She's checking abdominally, and finally I asked, ""Is there a heartbeat?"" She says she can't see it, but sometimes it's easier to see through vaginal ultrasound. I can tell she's stalling. I saw a heartbeat abdominally just two days previous. Finally, she checks vaginally.

Torture. The secretary handed me some intake paperwork, that I guess I hadn't filled out when I had my first appointment there. I barely cried, ""Is this all necessary? Can't you see what I'm here for?"" I was shortly called in, and had it again confirmed.

It sucks so hard that such a thing has to exist. But anyway. My husband and I have a 2.5 year old son. We were trying for about a year to conceive when we found out January 8th that we were finally pregnant! I was so over the moon. My husband was too! We dreamed of our son finally becoming a great older brother, my husband would rub my belly and say, &quot;I can&#39;t wait to see your big pregnant belly again!&quot; I wasn&#39;t sure about the dating of the pregnancy, so I went in for a quant blood test, as that was the recommended starting point from the Dr&#39;s office. </p>

<p>When the first results seemed low, they had me come back. When the increase in hcg wasn&#39;t high enough to their liking, I went in for an ultrasound. Everything looked, &quot;Perfect! Exactly what we want to see at this point,&quot; said the doctor. Phwew! Sweet relief. </p>

<p>So a week goes by, and I&#39;m feeling tired, my boobs feel more sore, I feel pregnant. There&#39;s some light cramping here and there, but that felt normal also. Then, on Sunday, January 31, I had some bleeding. It was brown though, so I didn&#39;t want to worry that much, as I was aware implantation bleeding discharge could happen. I called Monday morning to make an appointment, and was able to schedule one for the next day. Tuesday morning, I go in for the appointment. The scheduler messed up and scheduled me for Wednesday. I threw a huge fit and demanded to be seen. My doctor, being the wonderful lady she is, made room to see me. The ultrasound showed the brightest little fluttering thing! &quot;There&#39;s your baby, and there&#39;s your heartbeat! Everything looks perfect!&quot; I was about 6weeks6days</p>

<p>Phwew! Even more relief. I had a picture in hand, PROOF that I was pregnant. Elated, I told several friends, coworkers, family members, etc. the great news. Everyone was so excited for us, especially my son. He talked about how he was going to be a big brother and help mommy take care of the baby. </p>

<p>The following day, I go about preschool drop-off, work, lunch, more work as usual. I notice an increase in bleeding. This time it&#39;s red. I call the Dr&#39;s office again. I&#39;m so tired of calling that number by this point. They tell me to come in the morning. I get an official ultrasound in the radiology building. The radiologist goes about the usual procedure, without saying a word. She&#39;s checking abdominally, and finally I asked, &quot;Is there a heartbeat?&quot; She says she can&#39;t see it, but sometimes it&#39;s easier to see through vaginal ultrasound. I can tell she&#39;s stalling. I saw a heartbeat abdominally just two days previous. Finally, she checks vaginally. Again, she&#39;s stalling. Lot&#39;s of moving the computer mouse, clicking the keyboard, typing in notes of what&#39;s on the screen. I ask to view what she&#39;s viewing. Finally I see it. My baby. No longer a bright flutter. My baby a flat grey color. I can&#39;t explain how there was such a difference just on ultrasound, but there was. She didn&#39;t have to confirm what I already knew. But I asked anyway once again. &quot;Is there a heart beat?&quot; She only shook her head no, then said she&#39;d have the doctor follow up with me. And that was that. </p>

I had my daughter at 28 weeks in December 2014. She spent 10 weeks in the NICU and it's been really rough, but we've been fortunate and she's now healthy. The day she turned 13 months old we found out I was pregnant. We had been trying and we were delighted.

I was a little worried because I wasn't having much in the way of symptoms, but I had no real reason to be concerned. On February 19 at 7 weeks pregnant I had my first appointment and the ultrasound showed my uterus was empty though my HCG level was over 10,000. Several hours later, after many ultrasounds and very little information, it was confirmed that I had an ectopic pregnancy. My HCG levels were too high for the pill so I had to have laparoscopic surgery ASAP. Around midnight I had the surgery to remove the pregnancy and my left Fallopian tube. 

During the surgery, they checked and my doctor said my ovaries looked good and my one remaining tube ""looked beautiful"" but when they tried putting dye in it it wouldn't go through. They want to try getting dye through it again, but we have to wait 3 months. If that tube is also blocked most likely my only option will be IVF. That's 3 months of not knowing if I'll be able to get pregnant again (I'm not sure if we could afford IVF and there's not even a guarantee it would work).

This whole thing has been absolutely devastating. I lost my baby. And now I don't even know if I can have another. I've always wanted to have at least 3-4 kids. I've had one preemie, one ectopic pregnancy, and the future is so uncertain. I feel like the chances of that are slipping further and further away.

My cousin found out she was pregnant just before me and yesterday, exactly one month out from my loss, was the day she announced her forth was due two days after my due date. I know she didn't do it maliciously and I'm sure she didn't remember it was the one month mark from my loss, but of ALL the days she could have done it that was the worst.

As you all know, Mother's Day promises to be a very emotionally charged day for many of us. Even though we don't have living children, we still know ourselves to be mothers. We will be organizing a Mother's Day exchange so that we can send love and support to each other on this day.

A Google form has been set up so that we can facilitate exchange matches. You can request to be with someone in the same situation as you (not pregnant, pregnant, just had new baby, or no preference) and give your match an idea of how you remember your little one(s).

The spending limit is between $10-$20 and all gifts should be mailed out by Friday April 22nd, 2016.

I was having a TFMR of my baby girl with triploidy. I also haven't been very present over the my past week of loss limbo while waiting for my D&E. I had my D&E yesterday at the hospital where I work in labor and delivery. It was actually nice that I knew a lot of the staff including my anesthesiologists. Everyone was so supportive and kind. My regular OB came to check on me before the procedure and we cried together. The anesthesiologists gave me general anesthesia instead of IV sedation so that there would be no risk of me feeling/being aware of anything, since I told them I had been having nightmares and anxiety about this. I had also already had two doses of dilaudid because my cramps from the cytotec I premedicated with were incredibly painful, so they were worries that IV sedation wouldn't help as much. The last thing I remember was getting versed (the calm you and make you sleepy and forgetful medication) and the anesthesiologist turning off the brake on my bed. I don't even remember getting to the OR or anything thanks to the amnesia inducing versed. 

The chaplain blessed our baby and the social worker set us up with a funeral home that will do the cremation for free. 

We decided to name our baby girl Alma Lee ( Alma mean nurturing soul in Latin, Lee is the family middle name on my side) and we plan to plant a memorial tree at our new house and scatter her ashes with my grandpa's ashes when we plant the tree. My grandpa passed away in January and was beyond excited to finally have a great grandchild. My family agrees that it would be nice for them to be together. 

I cried on and off all day yesterday, but I think the pain meds are making it hard to really process the emotional pain right now too. 

I also wanted to thank everyone on this group. I received so much support and kind words when I introduced myself. I'm very glad I found this place and the ""Ending a Wanted Pregnancy"" support group (can't remember who suggested, but thank you so much). 

I really want to share a bit of my perspective as a labor and delivery nurse. I remember and think about every single loss that I have taken care of whether it was a medical termination or stillborn, etc. I remember the babies and I remember the families and I don't get to tell them that. But here I can tell you guys that I know your babies have impacted more lives than you might imagine. And they bring strength to people in ways you might not imagine; maybe it's by helping a nurse or care provider become better at supporting future patients through loss or by helping others (here) find strength while enduring their own loss. 
Sending love to all of your babies. 💗

I was having a TFMR of my baby girl with triploidy. I also haven&#39;t been very present over the my past week of loss limbo while waiting for my D&amp;E. I had my D&amp;E yesterday at the hospital where I work in labor and delivery. It was actually nice that I knew a lot of the staff including my anesthesiologists. Everyone was so supportive and kind. My regular OB came to check on me before the procedure and we cried together. The anesthesiologists gave me general anesthesia instead of IV sedation so that there would be no risk of me feeling/being aware of anything, since I told them I had been having nightmares and anxiety about this. I had also already had two doses of dilaudid because my cramps from the cytotec I premedicated with were incredibly painful, so they were worries that IV sedation wouldn&#39;t help as much. The last thing I remember was getting versed (the calm you and make you sleepy and forgetful medication) and the anesthesiologist turning off the brake on my bed. I don&#39;t even remember getting to the OR or anything thanks to the amnesia inducing versed. </p>

<p>The chaplain blessed our baby and the social worker set us up with a funeral home that will do the cremation for free. </p>

<p>We decided to name our baby girl Alma Lee ( Alma mean nurturing soul in Latin, Lee is the family middle name on my side) and we plan to plant a memorial tree at our new house and scatter her ashes with my grandpa&#39;s ashes when we plant the tree.

It was hard for me to find first-hand information about the MVA, and most information I did find was kind of fear-mongering from people who had gone through a D&C under anesthesia and couldn't comprehend that anyone would do this while awake. I wrote up a [post!](https://www.reddit.com/r/Miscarriage/comments/3doxn4/my_mmc_and_experience_with_mva_an_inoffice/) after my first MVA that seemed to help provide some info to others going through it. It was great to have a procedure that didn't carry the risks of general anathema and sported a shorter recovery period to boot. 

After going through my second miscarriage back in October, I had another office MVA, but this time she did not remove everything. I had retained placenta which I passed 9 weeks after the MVA. This led to mild infection and after an MRI, my RE saw a band of scar tissue which would need to be removed. (AKA Asherman's, though a seemingly mild case). All this leads me to an in-office hysteroscopy.

Office Hysteroscopy: Again, I was kind of freaked out about doing this procedure while in an office setting, but I also was kind of relieved that I wouldn't have to be placed under general. I had the procedure yesterday and it was honestly kind of awesome. Here's the deal: Night before I inserted 2 tabs of misoprostol to start dilating my cervix. I also took 800mg ibuprofen and a Tylenol w/ codeine. This was the part I was most concerned with, as the contractions I went through passing the retained tissue were pretty horrific and I wasn't eager to go through similar pain. But thankfully, I had very minor cramps and slept mostly straight through the night. The next morning, I took a Valium and 2  Tylenol w/ codeine before heading to the doctor. Once there, they gave me a shot of another anti-inflammatory and another injection of something to prevent muscles from seizing (quite important in this area I imagine). 

My husband sat with me and there were 2 nurses and the doctor (the head of microsurgery at my hospital). She injected lidocaine for the cervical block, which was the only painful part, but only minor. The block was awesome and I literally felt nothing throughout the rest of the procedure. (Side note: I process novocaine and other similar medications slowly so I always request that doctors give me an additional 5 minutes after injection. One doc told me she will starting this with other patients as it makes the dilation easier). 

Then she dilated my cervix and inserted the hysteroscope. There was a big monitor that we both could see. It was kind of awesome. She was in there to remove scar tissue, but surprise! there were polyps too! Within  few seconds she removed the polyps with the micro scissors, and kept searching for scar tissue, which she found and removed. She explained everything I was seeing (including the openings to my fallopian tubes, which were partially blocked by the polyps) and the whole thing was over in less than 10 minutes. It was pretty satisfying to see the polyps and scar tissue get removed and then see a clear uterine cavity afterwards, especially since the polyps could possibly have been causing the miscarriages.

Depending on how much is removed, some people start estrogen therapy (to encourage lining regrowth) or a balloon inserted to prevent scar tissue from reforming. I have migraine with aura and cannot take estrogen because of that. My doctor said this was fine and that many studies show that there is no clinical difference in scar regrowth with balloon or estrogen vs. doing nothing. 

I will be using castor oil packs and continue yoga and acupuncture to increase blood flow, but fingers crossed there will be no scar regrowth. 

After the procedure, I felt a little sore and slow. I took 2 more Tylenol w/ codeine  that day, and have continued ibuprofen today. I have almost no pain, no cramping and feel pretty great. 

I hope this can help anyone out there who will be getting an in-office hysteroscopy! It is kind of cool to be awake for it, and your recovery time is slight.
