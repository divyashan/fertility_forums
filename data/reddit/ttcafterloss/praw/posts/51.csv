0,2048,confidence,<praw.reddit.Reddit object at 0x7f12a630cd90>,,ttcafterloss,"Hi, I'm new here.  I just found this sub last night, which was fitting.  I'm not sure if I need anything specific except maybe to talk.  I'm 33.  I have one child who's 2 years old.  I'm currently experiencing my 3rd miscarriage.  I'm angry, I'm scared, I'm lonely.  I'm sad. 


Pregnancy #1 (CP): First month trying, we got pregnant!  I was so smug, in retrospect.  Natural miscarriage at 5w2d.  Didn't think much of it, as OB reassured me how normal chemical pregnancies are.  


Pregnancy #2 (MMC): The next month, we got pregnant again!  I was elated.  Of course we're just super fertile (I want to smack previous me).  I had some minor pregnancy symptoms (so I thought), but nothing major.  A 10.5-week u/s showed a 6-week fetus with no heartbeat.  The midwife I saw that week kept trying to tell me my dates were just off, but come on.  How would I have gotten a positive pregnancy test 4 weeks before conceiving?  A week later showed a 5-week fetus, and at about 12 weeks I had a D&E.  I was absolutely devastated.  My husband assured me (as did the doctors) that we just had terrible luck.  


Pregnancy #3 (healthy): It took me 6 months to get pregnant again, which was torture.  I was becoming certain those two miscarriages were my only chances, that maybe something happened during the surgery and I'd never get pregnant again, who knows.  When we did get pregnant, I was elated and scared.  I comforted myself in statistics--it was so, so, so unlikely we'd miscarry a 3rd time.  And little by little, I started to feel more confident.  At 5 weeks, my betas were increasing perfectly.  The doctor gave me progesterone even though he said it was unlikely to help, but it just might make me feel better.  I began having nausea regularly.  I got u/s scans at 6 weeks, 8 weeks, 10 weeks, 12 weeks.  When the 10-week scan was healthy, I felt like I could breathe again.  This pregnancy resulted in my now 2-year-old son, who's the light of our lives.
 

Pregnancy #4 (MMC): After my son was born, I had an IUD inserted, knowing I'd probably only want it in for a little over a year or so, since we want more children.  This summer, I had the IUD taken out and we began ""not trying not to.""  I got caught up in it quickly, and by the second month was charting and timing intercourse because I knew we were ready.  On the 4th month trying, we got pregnant despite relatively bad timing and only having intercourse once (my husband was traveling a lot).  I'm supposed to be 8 weeks now.  We were just elated.  An August baby!  We can tell our families at Christmas!  It's great timing for both of our jobs!  Our son will be almost 3 when his brother or sister is born--what a great age spread!  Etc.  I bought maternity clothes during the Black Friday sales.  I finally felt convinced that the first two miscarriages had truly been terrible luck.  I watched the miscarriage charts every day--chance of miscarrying a third time is so low, of course this will be my chance for a perfect, worry-free pregnancy!  


My betas went up perfectly around 5 weeks.  My doctor suggested progesterone again, despite the fact that it may not do anything, and I eagerly accepted.  She said the earliest I could come in for a viability scan was 7-8 weeks.  I scheduled the u/s at 7 weeks on the dot.  I felt more confident as I began to feel intense nausea most days, which I had never felt with any other pregnancy except the successful one.  Last week, when I went in for the scan, the sonographer found a 5w5d fetus with a ""flicker.""  I bawled.  I knew I shouldn't be measuring that far behind.  Even so, I've spent the last week poring over study after study, forum after forum, to convince myself that the baby was just in a funny position, maybe I'm 2-3 days off because of late implantation, etc., etc., etc.  Yesterday, I went back.  There's no heartbeat, and the embryo hasn't grown any.  


I took my misoprostol about an hour ago and I'm waiting for something to happen.  How long will it take?  I'm so anxious to get this over with.  I can feel the pills still just sitting up at my cervix.


I'm so sad, so angry, so bitter.  I can't chalk this up to bad luck anymore, right?  Will I ever have another healthy pregnancy?  What's wrong with me?  Why does everyone else (it seems) have as many easy pregnancies as they want?  What am I doing wrong?  Will the next one just be another miscarriage?  How do I keep going?  I feel so hopeless.  I've been referred to a RE for whatever bloodwork is ""recurrent pregnancy loss bloodwork.""  But even that seems so hopeless--what are the chances they even find anything?  


If you've made it this far, thank you for letting me share.  It just helps to know I'm not alone.  

UPDATE: Thank you all for the comments and support.  I took the second dose about 8 hours after the first, and that got things moving along.  I'm actually surprised that it wasn't nearly as painful as I had been anticipating (I hope this isn't indicative of not having been completed!).  This is a great sub, and I'll be sticking around for the time being.  Thanks again, and hugs to everyone experiencing miscarriage in any of its forms.  This fucking sucks.

Hey everyone! It's time for our (northern hemisphere) Winter Holiday Gift Exchange!

Suggested spending amount (excluding shipping) is $15. This is just to give you an idea of the rough value the gift should represent. If you want to handmake a gift that you think your recipient will like, that's great! Please feel welcome to do so.

Please let me know when you sign up whether you're willing to ship internationally (which should be one of the sign up questions), and if you're not willing to give a gift to an alumni member. The focus of the presents should be on the member and not pregnancy or baby related, and I encourage everyone to create an Elfster wishlist (or link to an amazon one or something else) so that people don't have to dig through your reddit history for ideas.

Sign up (link removed) on Elfster. The deadline to sign up is December 23rd. You do not have to connect it with your facebook account or display your real name, but I do ask that everyone adds their reddit username. Last year one person did not send a gift and it was the one person who did not really have much of a posting history here, so I would like to make sure everyone who signs up is actually active on this subreddit.

I currently have the gift arrival deadline as January 15th, but let me know if you'd like to move it earlier. I'm copying r/infertility this year, and we'll do a big post maybe a week or so after the deadline, where everyone can share what they received.

I couldn't find an easy way to run a card exchange, so I think I'm going to drop that for this year (although my husband is trying to code something for me that will do the matches so we'll see).

Also, it turns out we haven’t gotten pregnant again because of a low sperm count, and as far as the multiple losses, my doctor just thinks I’m unfortunate enough to be in that super tiny percentage that has back to back miscarriages. 

I’ve been publicly open about my losses, how it has effected me, and the struggle to get pregnant again. I haven’t been public about the low sperm count or the possibility that we are divorcing. 

My first due date was in early January of 2016. My birthday is Tuesday, and I’ll be 32 with a very low AMH number for my age. Then there’s Christmas. Basically this time of year is just shitty. So I started blogging just as an outlet for my anger. And I posted it on my Facebook and Instagram, because I’ve always been open. 

Side note: husband’s sister had a baby at 16, and then my brother got her pregnant shortly before I found out I was pregnant the first time. Delicate situation. 

Anyway, in one of my posts, I mentioned that it was hard to lose my pregnancy in May, attend my niece’s birthday party in June, my sister in laws baby shower in July, be present for the baby’s birth in September, go through the holidays not pregnant, go through what should have been my daughter’s due date in January, and then also have my dog die in February. And all of that happened before I even got pregnant the second time.

So my sister in law reads this, and is now angry because I’ve ""ruined every good memory she has of me and her children by revealing that I was unhappy and found the situation difficult."" She also told our other sister in law that I need to deal with my shit better and leave her family out of it.

TL;DR:  had an ectopic pregnancy in my right tube at the end of July, saved my tube so I still have both tubes but found out today that the right is completely blocked. Don’t know if I should leave it as is, try to have the block removed or just have my whole right tube removed. 

Here’s my story:
In mid-July, my husband and I went for our first ultrasound at what should’ve been 9 weeks. In the ultrasound, they didn’t see a baby. They saw what looked like a sac and that’s about it. We were told that I was miscarrying and scheduled for a D&C two weeks later because I wanted one more ultrasound just to confirm. 

A few days before the D&C, I was out to dinner with friends when I started feeling extreme cramping pain. I thought I was miscarrying naturally at that point and went home. The pain was really bad so I decided that I should probably go to the ER. Thank goodness I did, it turns out I had an ectopic pregnancy that was on the verge of rupturing. I was rushed to surgery to resolve it, they were able to save my right tube. 

Fast forward a few months later, I had an HSG today to check my tubes for blockage. We found that my right tube is completely blocked. I’m just wondering if anyone has experienced blockage in one tube and how they handled. I don’t know if I should just try and hope the egg goes through my left, try to get the block removed or if I should just get my right tube removed? Any insight or advice?

I'm not even sure where to start. I was part of TTCAL on The Bump back in 2013, then the AL community migrated to another site and later basically dissolved. I've been forum-homeless since then and recently realized there was probably something here on Reddit.

I've had three losses with no explanation. MH and I are both carriers for a disease that's fatal but it's not known at what stage of development it starts taking effect. I also recently found out that I have a mild clotting factor deficiency (low prothrombin), which may or may not have any relation to our losses.

I'm in the TWW right now, which I know is a bad time to intro but I needed a group. This is our first cycle actually TTC after our most recent loss and I still don't know how I feel about it.

My first pregnancy was in 2013 and turned out to be a blighted ovum that wouldn't pass on its own so I ended up having a D&C.

I asked my mom to tell me about my sister Grace and her birth (she was stillborn due to placental abruption). My mom said she knew when the contractions started that something was wrong. Before she even got to the hospital she was in so much pain and Grace was so active and moving non stop. Through tears she hugged her belly and said “Oh baby, please hold still” and Grace didn't move again. 

When my mom woke up from surgery they gave Grace to her and my mom dressed her and cuddled her all night. She wasn’t able to go to the burial (she nearly died through Grace's birth) so she asked my dad to wrap Grace in the blanket she had made for her so she wouldn’t be so cold.

Grace was born in late October in the midwest and during cold nights my mom said her arms physically hurt and she hated how alone Grace was.

Grace's story still makes me cry so much. Maybe I'm crazy but I like to think Grace isn't alone anymore and she's hanging out and having fun with my first baby. I bet when this current ectopic is resolved, Grace and baby #1 will have a welcome party for baby #2.

Or I just won't make any since the universe does what it wants.

I got pregnant in May after about 12 months of trying. We were getting a little disheartened and I got a referral for fertility testing from my OB at my annual. I was supposed to go on the third day of my next cycle which never came. 

We were beyond thrilled and felt ready for that next phase. Over the summer we told friends and family who shared our excitement. My first sonogram at 8 weeks shows low fluid so I had a repeat at 12 weeks which came back normal. At all my prenatal visits, we heard strong heartbeats and I never had any bleeding or nausea. 

Other than the first sonogram everything seemed fine and we had no reason to worry. I was growing a belly and had just moved into maternity clothes when I went for a routine 20-week anatomy scan. 

It was the Tuesday before the Saturday we were to depart on an early babymoon and my husband wasn't able to attend because the clinic delayed my appointment because of staffing issues. That morning is a little blurry for me, but let's just say the technician left me on a table for a half hour until the radiologist came in to tell me that our baby didn't have a heartbeat. I guess I looked confused because then he said, ""I'm sorry to have to tell you that this pregnancy will not progress.""

They tried to keep me in their little room and call my husband to come pick me up but I got out of there as fast as I could. I wish there had been another exit rather than the one thru the waiting room. As I walked to my car garbage collectors yelled not to worry that everything would be okay.

On Thursday we were admitted for an induction and the intake person had the nerve to ask me my due date. Other than that, the staff at the hospital were kind and compassionate. I was induced with Cytotec and labored pretty comfortably for about 14 hours. When they told me I was still at 0 cm, I asked to take them up on their offer of Morphine and delivered our son while the nurse was getting it.

Since then life has been weird and horrible and not like I imagined we'd be spending the last few months. We went to the hospital's memorial service held the weekend before Thanksgiving. I know holidays are rough for alot of people but this is the first time I haven't looked forward to Christmas. During Thanksgiving weekend I just kept thinking that we would've been having a baby shower if things had turned out better.

Hello all. I’m back, again... I suppose I never really left. Just got the phone call from my doctor with the information I already knew was coming... 

This is now my third loss this year, three cycles in a row. Two CP’s in a row, and an MMC in July at 9 weeks. Why? I know that’s something we all ask ourselves. But really, I just want to know *why.* And of course everyone I know is pregnant, or just had a baby. Having to go into the doctors office for blood work yesterday to confirm my dropping numbers and seeing all of these people coming in with their big bellies just really was the icing on the cake. 

I never wanted to be this bitter person. I’m finding myself so *angry* at other people’s happiness and that’s just not who I am, but it’s who I’ve become... it’s not their fault I’m going through this, and it’s not my fault either. *No one is at fault for this, but I feel like I need someone to blame...* 

And all of the empty “I’m sorry’s” And “it will happen soon!” And “it just wasn’t meant to be/god’s plan for you” ...seriously? You think that helps?! I’ve been told by many people to just be thankful for the child I have. You think I’m not thankful for him?! Can I not want another child? It’s like it somehow is supposed to diminish my hurt from these losses. Spoiler alert, it doesn’t. 

I’m hurting both physically and emotionally right now. And being told how I need to feel by people who have never experienced this is starting to push me over the edge. Ugh, I’m sorry.

Back when I miscarried, it didn't even cross my mind that I wouldn't be pregnant on this date, but here we are. How is today in reality? It actually has been a perfectly normal, enjoyable day so far. It was a little bothersome seeing super pregnant mamas this weekend knowing that would have been my alternate reality, but I'm coping pretty well otherwise. 

I decided to give this an actual post to give a little more visibility to the fact that this day can be okay. Sure, it's scary and feels a little out of control. Sure, I would have been THRILLED to be falling in love with a little one and getting ready to welcome him or her (but my gut told him ""him"") home. At the end of the day, so many other things in my life still are going well now, and I can't help but acknowledge and enjoy and appreciate that. 

If I am being completely honest, some of the things that I appreciate now were an indirect reaction to the miscarriage. I am stronger than I ever have been because I decided to go to the gym to regain a feeling of control over my body. My work is going well because I have had more time to dedicate to it than I anticipated over the last few months. Of course, I would rather have had a baby today. Of course, I would rather have never had to experience the miscarriage at all. Still, today feels more like a mark of survival than anything else. My fear was not being pregnant again by the due date. That fear came true, and I'm still standing. It's not what I wanted, but facing that fear and being okay is empowering at the same time. 

I may have been a hot mess at various points over the last several months, but I survived - and continue to survive.

At the end of the day, so many other things in my life still are going well now, and I can&#39;t help but acknowledge and enjoy and appreciate that. </p>

<p>If I am being completely honest, some of the things that I appreciate now were an indirect reaction to the miscarriage. I am stronger than I ever have been because I decided to go to the gym to regain a feeling of control over my body. My work is going well because I have had more time to dedicate to it than I anticipated over the last few months. Of course, I would rather have had a baby today. Of course, I would rather have never had to experience the miscarriage at all. Still, today feels more like a mark of survival than anything else. My fear was not being pregnant again by the due date. That fear came true, and I&#39;m still standing. It&#39;s not what I wanted, but facing that fear and being okay is empowering at the same time. </p>

<p>I may have been a hot mess at various points over the last several months, but I survived - and continue to survive. Since I have used this forum so much to share my fears and sadness, I thought that I would take a moment to make a top level post sharing something a little positive as well. I am sending everyone here love and good vibes for strength and happiness today. </p>

It's been a while since I've been on here so I'm ahoping little rusty, I hope this type of post is allowed and that this is the right place for it. If not please let me know and I'll remove it asap. (Trigger warning: mention of LC.) 

Peyton was our firstborn, and after we lost her, I was pretty active on this thread while ttc again, and in the alumni thread. We had a healthy rainbow son born Sept. 4, 2016 after a very rocky pregnancy. He's now 15 months old, and because of what we went through with his pregnancy and having a close relationship w/ a mfm that I'm finally happy with, we've decided to ttc again. We are so incredibly lucky to have our son, but I've had a number of health issues come up postpartum with him that could cause fertility issues that will get worse with time. Adenometriosis being probably the worst. I also was diagnosed with hypothyroidism after I had him, but it's being controlled with synthroid. The problem is, since I had my son I have only had three periods. My body is not ovulating. We are set to start Clomid in February, but we are still hopeful that we might conceive without it if my body cooperates. 

The past six days, my pks have been so so close to being positive, but one very small shade away from being as dark as the control (especially the ast three days). I've never had this happen before. Even with the three times I've ovulated since having my son, my pks were always stark white until they got as dark as the control for two days before fading out. (I've never had a test darker than the control, even before all this).

I kept expecting the lines to get darker and they just haven't. I actually started tracking again in February, after my period didn't come back postpartum. My last cycle was two months ago. 

So that's where I'm at.. I hope I haven't violated any rules posting this. I'm sorry we're all here, but the support from this thread has gotten me through so much.

Today at my ultrasound the tech did see some ""stuff"" in my uterus, but the sac was gone and almost everything passed. The doctor said that she was comfortable that I would likely pass what was left (a little blood and tissue) and only to call if I had heavy bleeding still next Wednesday, but she thinks it'll taper off. So that's good! 

But last week the doctor had said we could try right away, and this week we'd be able to order blood work and look at things like progesterone and clotting issues etc. 

The doctor today said no, we had to wait one regular period, and that I need another appt with my regular doctor (a third one from the previous 2) and at that point she could look into what tests I need. She also said progesterone was ""voodoo"", that it was hard to interpret and would only tell you if a pregnancy was failing but you couldn't do anything anyways. To which I said, well I would have loved to know 4 weeks ago this pregnancy was failing! 

Luckily my appt is the 20th with my regular doctor so I guess at that point we will talk about what tests I need. I am not sure if we will listen about waiting a regular period to try though. The first doctor said it wasn't necessary, I know a lot of them do but why conflicting info?

72,2048,confidence,<praw.reddit.Reddit object at 0x7f12a630cd90>,,ttcafterloss,"So I had my first RE visit today. 

It started out rough. I had a really hard time finding the place. Luckily, I got there in time anyway. I had to have a tele consult appointment since there isn't any RE's around where I live. The place I was having it at had no idea why I was there and didn't have me on the schedule. I was tearing up at this point and panicking. The office only does tele consults once a month and they're skipping January. I called the office and explained what was happening to the nurse and she was super helpful. Finally, they worked everything out. 

I discussed my past losses with the RE. He seemed knowledgable, but not very attentive. He brought up that he read I have a bicornuate uterus.. but I know I don't. I just had an ultrasound to check. Then he brought up the baby I lost had trisomy 18. That's not true either. I had markers for trisomy 18, but she actually had triploidy. I explained all of this multiple times, but he seemed to write me off. I was so confused and worried. These things would change everything I thought I knew about myself and my fertility. As I'm sure you guys are aware, trisomies could be hereditary and triploidy is random. I called my regular OB when I left and asked her to review my file. She reviewed every ultrasound I had and agreed that I do not have a bicornuate uterus. She stated the RE did not write that in his note either, so he must have realized he was mistaken. She also assured me that though it states in my file the initial markers suggested trisomy 18, my baby's karyotype showed triploidy. He must not have read carefully enough. He and the nurse kept mentioning ""the other patient"" that he must have been seeing after me. I think he mixed up our uterus shapes.. I know he's probably very busy, but really? 

He ordered me more tests. Another thyroid test, antiphospholipid syndrome screening, karyotype and a sonohysterogram. 

I'm most nervous about the karyotype. If I have an issue with my chromosomes, there's no fixing that. He also told me to not get pregnant in the mean time. This makes me nervous since it's been 2 months since my last loss and we prevented the first month but not after that. I just ovulated this week and could possibly have conceived. He said that if everything comes back okay he will just have me try again anyway. So, hopefully it all works out. 

Later as I was waiting in the hospital lab to have my blood drawn my pharmacy called. They said ""you were just ordered an antibiotic for before the sonohysterogram, but our system is flagging you as pregnant. Are you pregnant?"" Nope, not anymore at least. Thanks. Ugghhh.

What a day. All in all I'm satisfied. He ordered what I had expected. He did not once mention IVF. I was surprised and glad I didn't have to have that discussion.

I just wanted to share this with someone besides my SO. He's great and supportive but my fertility rambling makes no sense to him haha.

I was tearing up at this point and panicking. The office only does tele consults once a month and they&#39;re skipping January. I called the office and explained what was happening to the nurse and she was super helpful. Finally, they worked everything out. </p>

<p>I discussed my past losses with the RE. He seemed knowledgable, but not very attentive. He brought up that he read I have a bicornuate uterus.. but I know I don&#39;t. I just had an ultrasound to check. Then he brought up the baby I lost had trisomy 18. That&#39;s not true either. I had markers for trisomy 18, but she actually had triploidy. I explained all of this multiple times, but he seemed to write me off. I was so confused and worried. These things would change everything I thought I knew about myself and my fertility. As I&#39;m sure you guys are aware, trisomies could be hereditary and triploidy is random. I called my regular OB when I left and asked her to review my file. She reviewed every ultrasound I had and agreed that I do not have a bicornuate uterus. She stated the RE did not write that in his note either, so he must have realized he was mistaken. She also assured me that though it states in my file the initial markers suggested trisomy 18, my baby&#39;s karyotype showed triploidy. He must not have read carefully enough. He and the nurse kept mentioning &quot;the other patient&quot; that he must have been seeing after me. I think he mixed up our uterus shapes.. I know he&#39;s probably very busy, but really? </p>

<p>He ordered me more tests. Another thyroid test, antiphospholipid syndrome screening, karyotype and a sonohysterogram. </p>

<p>I&#39;m most nervous about the karyotype. If I have an issue with my chromosomes, there&#39;s no fixing that. He also told me to not get pregnant in the mean time. This makes me nervous since it&#39;s been 2 months since my last loss and we prevented the first month but not after that. I just ovulated this week and could possibly have conceived. He said that if everything comes back okay he will just have me try again anyway. So, hopefully it all works out. </p>

<p>Later as I was waiting in the hospital lab to have my blood drawn my pharmacy called. They said &quot;you were just ordered an antibiotic for before the sonohysterogram, but our system is flagging you as pregnant. Are you pregnant?&quot; Nope, not anymore at least. Thanks. Ugghhh.</p>

<p>What a day. All in all I&#39;m satisfied. He ordered what I had expected. He did not once mention IVF. I was surprised and glad I didn&#39;t have to have that discussion.</p>

<p>I just wanted to share this with someone besides my SO. He&#39;s great and supportive but my fertility rambling makes no sense to him haha. I know you lovely people will understand :) </p>

I've been meaning to post an update for a while, but between life getting in the way and not knowing what to say, it's taken this long. [Sorry for the wall that you're about to encounter - there is a tl;dr at the bottom]

I think in my last post I left off with on 11/3 my HCG was 294.7. On 11/6 they had me do an ultrasound to check for any remaining tissue that could be causing the HCG increases [I don't think they checked thoroughly for an ectopic at this point because I wasn't having any pain or symptoms associated with, so they were on the thought of just remaining tissue in my uterus] which showed nothing. 

On 11/7 I had another blood draw that came back at 503! My local clinic then referred me to a town 20 minutes away to a gynecologist. At my appointment on 11/9 - he said from what he was seeing with my numbers and because there was nothing on my ultrasound and no symptoms to suggest otherwise, he thought, too, it was remaining 'products of conception' and recommended a D&C.

We scheduled the D&C for the following day [11/10] [they would have done it same day, but I didn't have a driver with me] - pretty simple procedure, really in the whole grand scheme of things. I was put out for about 25 minutes. Went home a couple hours later & rested, then proceeded to clean half my house the next day. They drew blood that day and told me after the D&C what my numbers were, but I cannot remember and can't seem to find it in my records, it was *just* over 600 though. 

On Monday 11/13 I had my blood drawn again - 629.9. Up, again. The following day [11/14] the nurse from the gyn called & they wanted me to do a urine test to rule out the ""rare, but possible"" false positive. If the urine test was positive, I was going to need another ultrasound. Well, that was positive and off I went to have the 2nd ultrasound where they were specifically looking for an ectopic pregnancy. I knew when it took longer than the first and she kept focusing on my right side, there was something off. I met with the Dr afterwards and he then suggested that based on what they saw [a mass in my right tube] that I would need to have surgery. 

I asked about the methotrexate shot. He said that it'd been so long since they used it, he didn't know the dosage, or if the hospital even had it in stock. He said he prefers laparoscopic surgery because then you know it's gone, there is no guarantee with the shot. Makes sense - so I opted for surgery, the next day. He did say that there was a possibility of waiting until the following week, but then we ran the risk of it turning into an emergency situation & that sounds like even less fun!

The Dr had said that it's with all hope to be able to save the tube, but not always possible. He also called that evening and said that after further information from the ultrasound it showed that my tube was swollen to 3/4in - 1in [normal is the size of a pencil he said].

So, on 11/15 I quit eating and drinking at midnight, as instructed [well, I guess I had some water at some point after that!] Went to check in at 9:30am I think, for surgery that was supposed to be around 10:30am. I didn't get taken back until 12:50. I was out for 2 hours and then spent another 3 in recovery/post op. When the Dr came out to talk to my grandma after surgery he said he couldn't believe I wasn't in pain for as large and damaged as my tube was! & Because of that, I write this with one less fallopian tube. However, they were able to save my ovary, which I guess is good news. Contrary to what I thought I was taught in 5th grade health, the remaining tube can 'float' to the ovary that doesn't have a tube & could potentially catch an egg that is released from that ovary. 

Luckily through all this, instead of having to wait for three to six months to TTC, we only have to wait about 3 cycles! & contrary to what the post op instruction sheet said, we don't have to wait 8 weeks to have sex! [my poor husband through all of this!!!] I got my stitches out on 11/20 & everything outwardly is healing great. I am just now waiting to bleed and start tracking cycles again, hoping that they are 'normal'! 

Dr said that missing the tube shouldn't cause any issues with future fertility [fingers crossed we don't have a 2nd ectopic!] We'll see I guess. In the meantime, I'm going to drink my way through the holidays. Work on getting me & DH healthier overall. Try to save some money and pay off some debt.... [Maybe I'll read that Dave Ramsey book I bought a few months ago!]  On a super positive note: My brother [step if we're getting specific] got engaged last Friday. Last night he & his fiance came over & she asked me to be a bridesmaid!! Wedding will be in November of next year, I think. So that will give me some good distractions for the next few months & who knows, maybe we'll be lucky & I'll end up being sober for their whole wedding & festivities!! 

If you've made it this far, thank you! If you haven't: 

tl;dr - slowly increasing HCG, nothing on first ultrasound. D&C done for remaining tissue, HCG still goes up. Five days later surgery for ectopic pregnancy with removal of my right fallopian tube. Waiting 3ish cycles instead of 6 months to TTC. 

Moral of the story - [as someone pointed out on my other post], you *CAN* have an ectopic pregnancy with no pain or symptoms!!

I was pretty terrified to go to the hospital as I have never been before, but I'm grateful to report that all things considered it was a good experience and pretty easy.

I had a weird feeling all along and was reluctant to tell too many people or buy a bunch of baby stuff- I'm grateful for that now.

Firstly, getting my name wrong on it is just a giant slap in the face. Worse than not receiving any acknowledgement at all.

Secondly, there might not BE any ""future blessings"" because we won't know if there's an underlying reason for my repeat losses thanks to the whole ""we're just a couple of hours behind schedule"" fiasco.

While not something they could have anticipated, this also happened on first CD1 after the loss when I am already so upset about the reminder.

<p>Firstly, getting my name wrong on it is just a giant slap in the face. Worse than not receiving any acknowledgement at all.</p>

<p>Secondly, there might not BE any &quot;future blessings&quot; because we won&#39;t know if there&#39;s an underlying reason for my repeat losses thanks to the whole &quot;we&#39;re just a couple of hours behind schedule&quot; fiasco.</p>

<p>While not something they could have anticipated, this also happened on first CD1 after the loss when I am already so upset about the reminder.</p>

<p>I am just a giant wreck right now, and perhaps unreasonably angry but it just was the icing on the cake of a shitty day I really needed to vent out. </p>

<p>So my neighbours don&#39;t think someone is being murdered, I&#39;m going to let out my angry screams here:

My hubby and I have an 18 month old son. In October we found out we were expecting our second. We were elated. I was so insanely sick though, starting at 4-5 weeks I could barely get out of bed. Then on November 6 I started bleeding. We went to the ER where they diagnosed me with a subchorionic hemorrhage. But the baby was perfect. They said take it easy and it will most likely resolve on it's own. The bleeding continued, I had tons of clots, and what I know now to be our baby. I went to a prenatal appointment on November 16, which was uneventful. She reiterated what the ER doc said, ordered labs and another ultrasound. She couldn't hear the heartbeat with the doplar but I was at 9 weeks so she didn't worry about it. They also called a couple days later to say my beta levels were ""kind of low"" so to make sure to schedule a follow up ultrasound. 

I had my ultrasound a week later. I knew instantly. The screen was totally empty. The doctor there confirmed that there was no sign of a pregnancy.

I have now gotten a look at my labs from both the ER visit and the prenatal appointment. And here's where I get really pissed. My levels in the ER at 7 weeks +5 were 40,000. My levels 10 days later were 3,500. How on earth is that ""a little low"". The OB office had my ER records. It's all in  the same hospital. She sat and looked at it during the appointment. I know it wouldn't have changed anything but it still infuriates me. I went a week thinking everything was fine. We hosted thanksgiving and talked about the new baby with our family all weekend.

The OB office called Friday and left a message to get follow up labs done. I honestly don't ever want to go back there. I know I'm not pregnant. I had an ultrasound so we know it's not ectopic. The bleeding is done, it's over. 

I've cried and cried. I feel so guilty for flushing my baby down the toilet. I feel guilty for having drinks with diner when I knew I could have been pregnant. I feel guilty for working out so hard after I knew I was pregnant. I feel guilty for not insisting on an ultrasound when we didn't hear a heart and for not prying more about the beta levels. I feel stupid for telling our family so early because now we've had to call and break all their hearts too.

I don't really want to wait to try again. Since I'm not going to go back to the OB I do kind of want to wait for a period for my own peace of mind. Plus we're traveling for Christmas and it will be one less thing to stress about.

____________________

I've been lurking for a couple months. Can't remember if I ever did an intro or not. I tend to start comments and posts, but delete because I can't think clearly. Came here from /r/infertility after our first *known* loss this past June.

Obligatory introductions. :) I'm 32, hubs is 33. We've been trying since Aug 2015. Tried seeing a few doctors at the beginning (at my mother's suggestion) to find out if I had the same issues my mom had getting/staying pregnant. I was told I'm ""young and healthy"" and should have no issue getting pregnant despite my abnormal cycles. Possible first loss Dec '15 - All symptoms were there, two weeks later than normal, but no BFP. Sept '16, we contacted a women's health center about seeing an RE. Again, ""young and healthy"" and was assigned a PA that had experience in infertility. Diagnosed Oligomenorrhea/hypothyroid, borderline PCOS, Infertile.  Few rounds of Clomid (only one with confirmed ovulation), one round of Letrozol (made me sick as hell...). HSG on a no treatment cycle in May '17... two weeks later... lo and behold a BFP!! Ahh! Only lasted 6 weeks. Ultrasound to confirm - the little tadpole couldn't implant. Saw my GYN, she cleared me to try again end of July. At that point, we were referred to a fertility clinic. Lots of tests, officially PCOS, levothroxine uped from 25mcg to 50 (with monitoring this time!). First IUI was last cycle, CD31 BFN, spotting showed up CD35. I feel like this was another loss, but we don't know for sure.

Taking this cycle off because hubs is out of town during fertile week. And next, because we'll both be out of town those days for a wedding. Anywho, after two years of disappointment, I don't know how much fight I have left. I'm seriously looking into adoption as our only option, but hubs isn't ready for that yet. I'm so tired of the questions and comments (When are you having a baby?... Are you pregnant yet?...Hiding a baby bump under those babydoll dresses?... You're next!!). I feel terrible knowing that some couples wait YEARS to get pregnant. Or never get to feel that joy. Both run in my family. But then again... so do twins.

I've found tons of ""What to expect/ask at my first RE visit"" posts, but they all seem to be for women who have trouble getting pregnant.

Currently I don't have trouble getting pregnant. I've had 3 losses (Blighted Ovum, TFMR Triploidy and Chemical Pregnancy/Early Miscarriage) but all 3 times I conceived first try. I'm not sure what to expect/ask in this situation. 

My OB did some RPL testing already. The only thing she found concerning is my thyroid is a bit high for TTC at 3.46 and I have a huge 6 cm x 4 cm cyst on my left ovary. I'm also heterozygous for MTHFR but she says it's not the concerning type. I feel like she's referring me for an opinion on what to do.

I'm trying to put together some questions to be prepared. So far I have:

* Should my thyroid be treated?

* Opinion on giant ass cyst? 

* Confirm MTHFR is non concerning

* Possible progesterone treatment? I've had bleeding throughout all 3 pregnancies

* Karyotype/Genetic/Chromosome testing and if it is covered by insurance

* I'm 26 is my egg quality bad already?

* My first 2 losses were right in a row 8 years ago. Most recent was October. Is this likely bad luck?

* Solid plan for next pregnancy as we could possibly conceive this cycle

I just got my period again for the first time since Sept, I was waiting at least one cycle to try (one gyno said wait 1-2, the other said 2 but then corrected herself to at least 1 and then if it happens it happens). I thought my period would come at the earliest 4 weeks and very possibly later from the D&C, but looks like it's my typical 25 day cycle instead. I conceived last time cycle day 10 or 12 (only days we had sex) so that gives me a looming timeframe. It is sooner than I thought it would be, and I am so nervous.

I want to conceive again right away so badly for the timing and to have some joy again... I am trying not to get my heart too set on it but damn, I want to so badly. But then I know I will be so anxious if it does happen. I was terribly anxious the last time, long before my nightmare came true. I don't know how I will overcome the fear. We have abstained from sex since early Oct for various reasons, I want it to be first and foremost an expression of our love but I guess it could bring a lot of other feelings too, I am nervous about that too.

As for possible contributing factors to the miscarriage... I am 35, had slightly elevated TSH in blood tests (3.35) indicating slight hypothyroidism in blood tests when the blighted ovum was confirmed... my gyno wants to see 1 for ttc so I've been taking thyroid hormones (T3 I think) since start of Nov. One gyno said low thyroid is more related to trouble conceiving than blighted ovum though, and the internist who saw me today said my thyroid looked small but normal and no one can really say if thyroid hormones can play a role in blighted ovum. But he thought taking T3 would be a good bet for ttc though he didn't consider me really hypo. My progesterone was only 11 but there doesn't seem to be any agreement oit there on if that is a cause or effect as far as blighted ovum... or how that could be connected to thyroid. In any case my gyno doesn't believe in just supplementing progesterone without testing it at another time in my cycle, and she doesn't see that as necessary at this point.

I know there are rarely any answers when it comes to miscarriages. Frankly I don't want there to be an answer, I don't want there to be something wrong with me for them to ppossibly be missing now that could lead to other losses. I just want it to have been garden variety bad luck, and I want my turn at good luck now please. Part of me is so terrified of another loss, possibly even further along (the blighted ovum was bad enough, I don't know how I would endure a miscarriage after seeing a heartbeat, or closer to 20 weeks, or a stillbirth...) There are so many stories of successful pregnancy right after a miscarriage, but what if that's not me? This and related subs have shown me that all kinds of things can happen to good, ostensibly healthy people.

Does anyone have any words that can help me? I could really use some. Please share your specific experiences if you wish... hormone experiences, how long you thought safe to wait after miscarrying, how you coped with sex, with conceiving right away or not... information helps me a lot... but just plain reassurance is good too.

**TL;DR:**

Had a MMC at 9.5 weeks (baby measuring at 7+1), misoprostol didn’t work, had to get a D&C. This is a *very* detailed account of my experience, partially because it’s cathartic to me, and partially because I hope it can help someone else out who is worried about going through it. You’re not alone. I don’t go too much into my mental and emotional struggles here because I’m still processing it.

**Loss:** 

Two days before Thanksgiving, I went into full blown panic attack mode because all my symptoms had disappeared for about 4 days. I could go 5 hours without eating no problem, my nausea was gone, and I was sleeping just fine. The nurse basically told me nothing they can do if I wasn’t bleeding, so I ended up scheduling a private scan for reassurance that afternoon thinking that would knock my silly anxiety down and I could go about my holiday. But then...the technician said she couldn't find the heartbeat. And if she had to guess I was measuring around 8 weeks. I was supposed to be 9+4. She mentioned it could have just been the position of the embryo, but considering we saw a heartbeat with abdominal scan at 7+2 just a couple weeks before, I was doubtful and my heart sank.

They didn't have a transvaginal transducer there, so I scheduled an appointment with a doc the following morning to confirm whether the pregnancy was still viable. I went into work that morning, accomplished almost nothing, and then went into my appointment with DH. The doctor confirmed that there was no heartbeat, and that the baby was measuring just a hair over 7 weeks. We discussed our options, but I knew going in that I wanted to try to avoid surgery if possible, but I also didn’t want to wait for it to happen naturally. We opted for the misoprostol. We cancelled our Thanksgiving flights and told our families (they knew about the pregnancy), got a prescription for the misoprostol to induce the passing, oxycodone for pain, and proclorperazine for nausea. 

**Misoprostol:**  

We armed ourselves with everything we needed – heavy duty pads, water bottles, comfort foods, board games, movies, and settled in for the worst. On Thanksgiving morning, DH and I made chocolate chip pancakes, I took ibuprofen and the anti-nausea meds, and about 30 minutes later put 800 mg of misprostol in my cheeks to dissolve per the instructions. About 30 minutes later, I rinsed down the remaining fragments and waited. I felt pretty sleepy (I think it was the anti-nausea meds) and laid down for a 3 hour nap). I had a little bit of cramping, but my cervix still felt high and firm that night, so I called the OB on call. They told me to fill the refill and try again the next morning.  

On Friday morning, I went through the routine again – ibuprofen and anti-nausea meds, followed by misoprostol in the same way 30 minutes later. This time I left them in for about 90 minutes until they were fully dissolved. By about 4 pm that afternoon, I had some light spotting, but nothing heavy. The spotting continued on Saturday, so I called the OB on call again. They agreed that it sounded like the misprostol had not worked. They told me to call on Monday to schedule an appointment with a particular doctor who was very good with the D&C procedures. That day, I got my hair cut, eyebrows threaded, and went to the library, walking about 5-6 miles in the process. It felt good to get out and feel like a normal person, but I was disappointed that all of the walking didn’t move things along.  

On the following Wednesday (1 week, 1 day after we first found out about the MMC), I met with the doctor to discuss and schedule the D&C. She did a quick transvaginal scan to make sure the pregnancy was still present (it was).  I’m leaving for a work conference on Saturday, so I wanted it done ASAP (combined with the mental anguish of still carrying around a dead baby. I was so ready to put this all behind me). We went over the paperwork, and she told me that I could start trying as soon as I felt ready and after my pelvic rest time was up (2 weeks after the procedure). She did say that they generally suggest waiting until after the first period but that’s primarily because of dating purposes, not any detrimental health reasons. We scheduled the D&C for the next morning.  


**D&C:** 

I was told no food or fluids after midnight, but an anesthesiologist friend of mine said they usually say that to keep it simple and I could have clear fluids up to two hours before (but no pulp). I had a few sips of water in the morning when I woke up to alleviate my dry throat. I packed some entertainment (book, journal), some snacks and water for post-op and for DH while I was back there, a phone charger, a couple pads, and my phone charger. 

DH and I were told to arrive at the surgical unit at 8:30 am. I wore something loose and comfortable (sweat pants, a pajama shirt, and a hoodie). We took public transit in (about a 20 minute ride and 10 minute walk). Once we got there, I had to fill out some paperwork (health care proxy, emergency contacts, agreeing to the procedure, etc.), get my medical bracelet, and we were sent to the waiting room. A nurse came out to check on us and told us I had been scheduled for 12:30 pm, but they were going to see if they had room to fit me in before. I was just about to drink some water, but another nurse said they had an opening and could take me back right away. This was around 9:15 am. 

DH was left in the waiting room briefly while they showed me my bed, had me change into my gown (fully nude underneath, open in the back) and non-slip socks. They had me lay down and put some pre-warmed blankets on me (seriously though, need to get myself a blanket warmer for home). They took my blood pressure, put a sensor on my finger to measure O2 and pulse, asked some questions about previous medical history and drug allergies, and brought DH back. The nurse came in and gave me two zithromycin tablets – she said that they give the antibiotic before the procedure to prevent infection. I took the tablets with two small sips of water. 

The anesthesiologist also came in, asked me some questions about previous responses to anesthesia and medical history, left briefly, and came back in with the IV hookup. He said he usually uses lidocaine to numb the area for any needle 20-guage or above, but he was able to use a smaller 22-guage needle for this. Fortunately, he got the needle placed the first time (I was surprised, my veins can be difficult), removed the needle leaving the cannula inside, and taped it down. They attached me to a saline drip, which I was very grateful for because it didn’t take long for me to stop feeling as parched.  I got a nurse to help me with the IV bag so I could run to the restroom to relieve my bladder before the procedure started.

DH and I waited another 30-40 minutes or so, and the nurse-anesthesiologist came in. She administered some Toradol, which is an IV-administered NSAID like ibuprofen. She said that it would already be in my system by the time I woke up and should help with the pains afterwards. DH was sent back out to the waiting room, and at around 10:15-10:30 am, I walked the 15 feet into the operating room. The doctor I had met with the day before was there, as well as a nurse, a resident, and the nurse-anesthesiologist. They had me lay down, they put a fresh warm blanket on me, and had me scoot forward on the bed (like a pap, bum near the edge of the table). Instead of foot stirrups, my legs were held up by pads that went under my knees which was much more comfortable. The nurse-anesthesiologist said she would administer the Propofol (the anesthetic). In about 10-15 seconds, I got dizzy, and about 5 seconds later, I was out.  

While I was out, I think I must have felt some of the cramping because I had a dream that I was in labor with our daughter (we hadn’t confirmed the sex of the baby, but I’ve only ever had dreams that it was a girl). I guess they wheeled me back while I was still asleep because I woke up in the pre-op bed and upon remembering my dream, immediately started bawling. I regained my consciousness pretty quickly at around 11:00 am (so the whole thing was about 30-40 minutes, including the time it took to knock me out and for me to come back to). I commented on my post-op’s nurse fitbit (I have the same one) and mentioned I was cramping pretty badly, so they brought me some Tylenol. I realized while I was out they put me in mesh undies with a pad – the mesh undies are SO comfy, ladies. I took another pair home for later. 

They offered me food and drink, so I requested water and that DH be brought in because he had a Larabar for me (I have food allergies, so I can’t have most normal snacks like gold fish and chips). We went over the discharge paperwork (don’t drink alcohol for 24 hours, take ibuprofen and Tylenol as needed, pelvic rest for 2 weeks, no heavy exercise, call in if I’m bleeding heavily or get a fever), and they had me urinate in a collection bucket to make sure I wasn’t bleeding too heavily. They removed my IV line (painless, except for the removal of the tape), and some monitors on my upper chest.

I found out from the nurse that I was dilated to 7-8 mm (just under 1 cm) during the procedure, and they used the aspiration apparatus to go all the way to the top of the fundus of the uterus. Most of the cramping I’m feeling, she said, is the result of my uterus contracting back to normal size, but since the baby wasn’t very big, it shouldn’t last long.  I also asked about what pathology might be able to tell me (I was particularly interested in knowing if they could tell me the baby’s sex from pathology, but they said no because there’s not enough tissue and it had already been gone for a while. No guarantee we’ll get any answers. 

I was able to get dressed, and they wheeled me down to the main floor around 11:45 am, where DH and I caught an Uber home.  

**Recovery:** 

DH and I got home around 12:15 pm, and I was starving, so he ordered us some Pad Thai and we settled in to watch Netflix. I kept getting up because I could feel the blood leaking out of me. I’m definitely bleeding more now than I did directly after the procedure, but a hot water bottle/heating pad has been the best thing ever for the cramping. I didn’t feel like the ibuprofen or Tylenol were doing anything. Still getting a bit of lightning crotch, but otherwise feeling okay. I took a nap, and I’ll likely come back and edit this or make a new post on how my recovery progresses over the next week or so. My temps and resting heart rate have also been pretty wonky, so I’ll be sure to update those as well.

On Sunday, officially 16 weeks, I came home from my mothers for Thanksgiving. I had had a great few days off work and there was no fighting or arguing, a first at my house during the holidays.  I was so excited to come home because I had a full week of appointments and on Wednesday I was supposed to find out if our baby was a he or a she.
I got home around 3:30 pm and just went about my business. Around 4:30 I felt something go wrong and my water broke. It was one of the worst and scariest moments of my life. My husband drove me to the ER where I was diagnosis’s with PPROM ( preterm premature rupture of membranes) and threatened miscarriage. I was given an ultrasound where I found out my baby was still moving and had a heart beat of 170. My baby was still alive but there was very little amniotic fluid. I was told that basically there was nothing they could do. I had antibiotics and went home. 
I followed up with my OB on Monday where I found out my baby no longer had a heartbeat and I had no amniotic fluid at all. I was told that Mother Nature could take days to a week to run its course and my risk for infection was too high to wait it out. I was booked in to L&D that afternoon. The walk to that room past all the mothers waiting to meet their babies with smiles and families was one of the most painful walks of my life. I was set up in my room given fluids, an IV and a dose of misoprostol.

Thankfully it didn’t take that long. I got my second dose of Miso at 11 pm and by 1:30 am on Tuesday the contractions became very painful and I ended up taking some pain medication. 
At 2:16 am I gave birth to my Son, Daniel, on 11/28/17. He weighed 97 grams and was perfect. 10 fingers. 10 toes. He was everything I ever wanted. The rest of my experience went pretty smooth. I didn’t hemmorage or require a D&C for which I am forever grateful. But I walked out of that ward with empty arms and a broken heart. I have never felt so sad or so empty in my entire life.

Miscarriage in June, ectopic in August, and now this. I am numb. I saw it coming though, I just knew this was going to happen.

The doctor said we can start trying again right away, and I will get blood work done soon to see if they can find any abnormalities. Now I am just sitting on the couch like a zombie instead of celebrating and Christmas shopping. I just can't believe how unfair the last 6 months have been. 

Edited to ask- I really want to delete my Facebook for a while. Does anyone know, will that permanently delete all my pictures and albums, or do those come back if I reactivate my account?

I had taken a sperm analysis and was told that potentially due to my weight, I have some motility problems. I have been grappling with losing weight for years and I am a type I diabetic.

My birthday was this passed September. I wished for a baby. That is what I and my wife want more than anything. The next day, my wife had to work late and during dinner she mentioned that she was having some bad stomach cramps. She had to go back into work for an evening meeting but she texted me shortly after arriving and asked if I would get her. Something wasn't right.

About an hour later after picking her up and being at home, I convinced her that she needed to go to the emergency room as she was having a lot of vaginal bleeding. She had thought, her period started a few days before, but she had never experienced bleeding like this.  It turns out, she was having a miscarriage. Because of the remote possibility of getting pregnant, and because her period had only been a week or two late (which happens on occasion) she hadn't really considered the possibility of being pregnant. I learned later that for my birthday, she had considered taking a pregnancy test, but didn't want to be disappointed (again). I am glad she didn't. Not knowing she was pregnant and her having the miscarriage was tough, but having known, for one day, on my birthday, and then having a miscarriage would have been even more devastating.

Now, commercials with kids being excited for Christmas, talking about creating Christmas traditions with kids, thinking about how we could have been preparing for a baby in the next year has me really bummed out lately.

I know its terrible, but when my friends or even family are excited about their upcoming due dates, or their kid's Christmas, I want to just be a damn grinch about it.  It isn't their fault, but it makes me so sad and bummed out. 

Christmas is our favorite time of year and I want so much to be able to create and continue traditions with my children, but I cannot, because we haven't been able to have any, and the only one we were able to conceive, left us.

The holidays are exciting, and I am trying to be positive, but I will admit, this year has been a little tough this year.

<p>I know its terrible, but when my friends or even family are excited about their upcoming due dates, or their kid&#39;s Christmas, I want to just be a damn grinch about it.  It isn&#39;t their fault, but it makes me so sad and bummed out. </p>

<p>Christmas is our favorite time of year and I want so much to be able to create and continue traditions with my children, but I cannot, because we haven&#39;t been able to have any, and the only one we were able to conceive, left us.</p>

<p>The holidays are exciting, and I am trying to be positive, but I will admit, this year has been a little tough this year. We are still trying, but the fear and sadness I have isn&#39;t just for the one we lost, but also, what if we never get to create a baby again?</p>
