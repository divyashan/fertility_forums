This weekend we were talking about how this journey has been difficult in very unexpected ways that I think most people who try to sympathize don't even consider, such as:

* having to wait to TTC after a miscarriage (and having to use condoms during that time)
* all of my crazy hormonal changes on top of the emotional drain and the arguments that has caused
* having to get blood drawn so frequently
* not being able to plan any trips (or almost anything for that matter) too far in advance because we don't know if I'll be pregnant by then or how far along we'll be 

But there have also been some silver linings, that do make me grateful for this journey:

* DH and I have grown very close together, emotionally
* I discovered I have the MTFHR gene mutation and since taking methylfolate my quality of life has seriously improved
* With the extra year as DINKs we've been able to finish paying off our student loans, which is a huge blessing.
* I feel like I can sympathize much better with others who are grieving

I was hoping to start an updated discussion about people's experience with treating hypothyroid while TTC and pregnant. I have been skeptical about my own thyroid function for years, in part due to symptoms and in part due to family history. Years ago, I got tested and was told that my levels were not at a level that requirement treatment, *unless* I were TTC. When I did conceive, I immediately asked to get tested again and found that my levels were perfectly healthy (TSH around 2.5). You all know (or can correctly guess) how the pregnancy ended.

Last week, I went to visit a new primary care, and she decided to test my thyroid levels again. My TSH levels are up to 4.25, which is well above the healthy level for TTC. She immediately gave me a prescription for levothyroxine (generic for Synthroid) and a referral to an endocrinologist.

I know this is not the forum for medical advice, but I am curious to hear your experiences with TTC, MC, and thyroid hormones. Do your levels fluctuate a lot? Did anything noticeably change after you started levothyroxine/Synthroid? Did you receive any particularly helpful advice from your OB/endo? I want to hear it all, and I assume that others here would find this conversation to be useful as well.

Based on my reading, I'm under the impression that the various clinics in London have very different approaches based on the beliefs and research focuses of the physicians who lead the clinics.

37,2048,confidence,<praw.reddit.Reddit object at 0x7f12a630cd90>,,ttcafterloss,"I found out I was pregnant in January. It was a complete surprise. So many things had to have been just right for it to happen. My husband and I were still trying to come to terms with things, but at our first appointment at 9 weeks, it was undeniable. Strong heartbeat, arms and legs wiggling... It was so surreal. I never had any morning sickness, boobs were huge and heavy, but otherwise felt great the whole time. We felt confident announcing things right before our 13 week appointment...

We announced, we were excited, friends and family were excited, it was so great. I went to my second appointment alone. They had terrible finding the heartbeat on the Doppler, so looked on an old ultrasound machine since their tech was busy. I knew immediately. Everything was still. I felt numb. The NP wanted me to still see the tech, and I waited totally alone for what felt like forever, knowing my baby was gone. I finally was called into the ultrasound room, where the tech confirmed that the baby measured right at 10 weeks, and there was no heartbeat. 

My heart felt shattered in a way I didn't even know was physically possible. I texted my husband (who was in class) and he came home right away. I honestly don't remember much else. I ended up deciding to do a d&c because I didn't think I could handle passing our baby myself. My OB was on vacation, so another doctor did the procedure. It went mostly well. I ended up passing some missed tissue a few days later with major cramps. 

That's when all the pregnancy announcements started. There was no one for so freaking long, and then, EVERYONE. It was physically gut wrenching every time something popped up on Facebook. I promptly blocked every single person. It hurts even more because they're people I care about. I feel like such a shitty friend because I just can't bring up an ounce of happiness for them because I'm so broken and hurt. On mother's day, a pregnant woman was walking out of Walmart behind if and the greeter called out ""happy future mother's day!"" And I just started crying on the way to my car.

My due date should be September 27th. It's coming up soon and I'm just so ready for it to be over so I can quit thinking about these milestones I should have reached. Honestly, I've started to feel more at peace, but I still have really bad days, like today. Usually when I PMS.. but my husband and I are ready to start trying. I'm just terrified of it happening again. Miscarriage changed me in ways that I hate. I was always such a happy and optimistic person for the most part, and I'm just not all the time any more, and I feel jealous of all these women I see who are experiencing things I feel like I should be experiencing... But I'm really trying to be hopeful in the future.

It was a complete surprise. So many things had to have been just right for it to happen. My husband and I were still trying to come to terms with things, but at our first appointment at 9 weeks, it was undeniable. Strong heartbeat, arms and legs wiggling... It was so surreal. I never had any morning sickness, boobs were huge and heavy, but otherwise felt great the whole time. We felt confident announcing things right before our 13 week appointment...</p>

<p>We announced, we were excited, friends and family were excited, it was so great. I went to my second appointment alone. They had terrible finding the heartbeat on the Doppler, so looked on an old ultrasound machine since their tech was busy. I knew immediately. Everything was still. I felt numb. The NP wanted me to still see the tech, and I waited totally alone for what felt like forever, knowing my baby was gone. I finally was called into the ultrasound room, where the tech confirmed that the baby measured right at 10 weeks, and there was no heartbeat. </p>

<p>My heart felt shattered in a way I didn&#39;t even know was physically possible. I texted my husband (who was in class) and he came home right away. I honestly don&#39;t remember much else. I ended up deciding to do a d&amp;c because I didn&#39;t think I could handle passing our baby myself. My OB was on vacation, so another doctor did the procedure. It went mostly well. I ended up passing some missed tissue a few days later with major cramps. </p>

<p>That&#39;s when all the pregnancy announcements started. There was no one for so freaking long, and then, EVERYONE. It was physically gut wrenching every time something popped up on Facebook. I promptly blocked every single person. It hurts even more because they&#39;re people I care about. I feel like such a shitty friend because I just can&#39;t bring up an ounce of happiness for them because I&#39;m so broken and hurt. On mother&#39;s day, a pregnant woman was walking out of Walmart behind if and the greeter called out &quot;happy future mother&#39;s day!&quot; And I just started crying on the way to my car.</p>

<p>My due date should be September 27th. It&#39;s coming up soon and I&#39;m just so ready for it to be over so I can quit thinking about these milestones I should have reached. Honestly, I&#39;ve started to feel more at peace, but I still have really bad days, like today. Usually when I PMS.. but my husband and I are ready to start trying. I&#39;m just terrified of it happening again. Miscarriage changed me in ways that I hate. I was always such a happy and optimistic person for the most part, and I&#39;m just not all the time any more, and I feel jealous of all these women I see who are experiencing things I feel like I should be experiencing... But I&#39;m really trying to be hopeful in the future. </p>

I suffered a loss at 6+1 back in May. It was my first pregnancy, and my husband's 2nd child (he has a 5 year old with a previous girlfriend). I took it extremely hard, but my husband never really showed any emotion about it. I don't cry like I did in the weeks after it happened, but I still get upset, sometimes jealous at other pregnant women, or feel like it's unfair it happened to me. I often think about where I would be in the pregnancy now and long for that. We're TTC again but it's extremely frustrating to me that we're going through that again - I keep thinking ""I should be pregnant, we shouldn't even be having to do this again."" 

My husband doesn't seem to understand how I'm feeling and has said some things that really upset me. Things like ""It's over, there's nothing we can do about it, it's time to move on."" Or when I ask how he can not feel anything he says ""It didn't even have a heartbeat yet."" I correct him and let him know that it DID have a heart and a heart beat, we just hadn't gotten to hear it yet. 

When stressing about TTC and wondering if I'll get a positive test, I'll text him something like ""Took a test this morning, it was negative."" I'm hoping for him to say something like ""I'm sorry hun, I'm sure we'll get a positive soon."" Instead he just responds ""OK."" He says that me being upset about the miscarriage and stressing over when we'll get pregnant again is making it ""not enjoyable anymore"" for him. 

I sent him a poem about miscarriage, trying to explain how I felt (it's a wonderful poem, titled Just Those Few Weeks, for those curious), and didn't get any response. When I sent it to him again, he responded ""Am I supposed to say something"". 

I just don't know what to do. I feel like he's supposed to be supporting me, even if he doesn't understand how I'm feeling. Beyond that, I just don't understand how he can't be sad about our loss.

52,2048,confidence,<praw.reddit.Reddit object at 0x7f12a630cd90>,,ttcafterloss,"Hi folks!  

I lost my first pregnancy around 7 weeks (late last week) and had it confirmed today. I was diagnosed with a rather large SCH (4.5x4x1cm) about a week before the loss happened. Luckily I passed everything on my own, so no procedure or medicine needed.

I read the sidebar, and found some good info, but I'd still love to hear about anyone else's experiences TTC again after a loss, especially an SCH-related one. I spoke with a doctor (not my normal OBGYN bc she was on call) at the office today and was frustrated because I think some of what he said to me was flat-out wrong... (e.g. that there was definitely a chromosomal problem that caused both the SCH and the miscarriage. I have not read that anywhere else. I am fairly certain the SCH caused the miscarriage, and that's what my regular OB led me to believe could happen. The baby had a normal heartbeat at 6w1d and was perfectly on track size-wise.)

Anyway, some questions, in case anyone has similar experiences & feels like sharing.

-Did your doctor recommend waiting to TTC after a loss? From what I'm reading they only do this for dating purposes, and if I track and know when I ovulated, is there a need to get a period for dating purposes? Or is there some other reason to wait to TTC?

-Has anyone else gotten a clear answer about recurrence of SCHs or anything to do/not do while TTC to avoid them? My understanding is they're just random, but curious if anyone's docs have told them otherwise or recommended precautions/testing/etc.

Anyway - back to the world of temping and tracking and fingers crossed for a better outcome.

Hope all of you are doing as well as can be on this complicated journey.

If anyone has gone through something similar and would be open to chatting 1-1, I'd appreciate that as well.

<p><strong>EDIT:</strong> Talked to my boss this morning and shared much of your advice. Our immediate plan is contacting the various high up folks at the university to ensure our colleague has no work responsibilities until spring. A little longer term we are going to look into the tree, get a Thinking of You card for everyone to sign, and collect donations from other faculty and staff to go towards a personal chef for her family for a month or two after her meal train ends. As far as the gifts, I went in and removed my card and replaced it with one that says &quot;With love to [Baby 1] and [Baby 2].&quot;</p>

<p>Thank you all so much for providing insight to help me figure all this out for her.</p>

This was our first pregnancy and was to be the first grandchild for both sides. We had both sets of soon-to-be-grandparents and a few close friends already in the loop, all begging us to let them take the news public. Most exciting was the fact that my due date was only two days shy of my best friends due date, and she had just purchased a house down the road from our house. Without planning it, we were getting to share our pregnancy journeys together, as both best friends and neighbours. It was a dream come true. I also had a girl in my department at work who was also pregnant with her first, and was due in the same month as me, a few weeks after. My husbands coworker was also pregnant with her first. I was surrounded by the support of other people experiencing the same thing as me, and it was wonderful. 

On Thursday August 3rd, my husband and I excitedly took the day off work so we could go to my first ultrasound appointment together- we had reached the 12 week mark and were finally going to see the baby!! I had already made a video that we planned to use as our public Facebook announcement, and all it needed was the final image of the ultrasound picture. As soon as we got home, we planned to load the picture and share our news with the world. But that didn't happen. 

Our ultrasound appointment revealed that my 12 week pregnancy was measuring at only 8 weeks and 5 days, and there was no fetal activity and they couldn't find a heartbeat. They told us to go to the ER, and by 5pm the next day, i was in the hospital getting a D&C. 

So here we are, it's Sunday morning and I'm no longer pregnant. The ""reveal"" video I made is still open on my laptop, awaiting that last slide. My What To Expect app is still telling me what fruit my baby is the size of. The ""Grandma-To-Be in Feb 2018"" medallion that I got for my mom has been shipped from the Etsy supplier and will probably arrive any day. 

The OB made it very clear that this had nothing to do with me or my husband, and the baby was just lacking the necessary chromosomes to survive. He said we have no reason to anticipate any problems with our next pregnancy. But I'm sad because it was all so perfect, and I lost it- the family was all so excited. We got pregnant exactly when we wanted to, on our first try. I was ecstatic to be pregnant alongside so many friends. We'd talked about doing photos of all of us pregnant together. My best friend and I had a week planned when we wanted to get pre-delivery pedicures together. We had plans for fun Halloween costumes that incorporated our bellies. Now they all get to carry on, and I'm not a part of it anymore. I'm the odd-one out who's not pregnant anymore. Come February, I'll have 4 close friends nursing new infants, and I'll be constantly reminded that I wasn't supposed to be one of them. But I won't be.

I read a lot of posts online about people's experiences but I guess wasn't really prepared for my own. Here I was concerned about having to take a second or third dose. Luckily, I didn't get that far. So here's what happened. 

11:00 am - pills inserted by my GP. I laid there for about 45 minutes. 

12:00 pm - on my way home. Started feeling very mild cramps, nothing serious. 

1:30 pm - moderate cramps. 

3:30 pm  - cramps are now contractions now. Coming and going with peaks. 

4:30 pm - some  light bleeding. 

4:45-5:30 pm - contractions are back and I felt a sudden pop. Soaked through my extra heavy overnight bad. Then I soaked through another. I realized it wasn't going to stop and only get worse so I put on an adult diaper. Also, I realize I'm losing a lot more blood than I should and I'm starting to feel faint, so we we decided to go to the ER. I was in pain and I was bleeding more than 2-3 pads in an hour. 

6:00 - 1am - showed up at the ER and soaked through a diaper so I needed another. I soaked through that within 30 minutes. During this time I had really bad contractions and I went through 5 diapers while waiting and I was passing very large clots. I ruined my clothes. I was feeling faint and vomiting. Passed a very large clot around midnight and this is when I started feeling much better. I was also given an IV as well and had a blood test done to see how much blood I lost. I had lost a lot but not enough to need a D&C right away. So I was asked to come back in the morning for an ultrasound and follow up with the doctor. 

Next day: 

11am-1pm - I was told I passed almost everything and only had small clots left. I don't need a D&C. It was pretty strange seeing an empty womb on the screen. 

It was a painful experience and I didn't expect to be as bad as this but I'm glad this ordeal is over so I can move on with my life. Other things that I have not shared which happened during this time made this experience even more traumatic than it needed to be. So I feel pretty discouraged about wanting to try for another baby anytime soon.

I would give anything to have a viable pregnancy (like seriously I am at the point in my life where the Devil could ask me to sell my soul for a viable pregnancy and I would seriously consider doing it). I know it's wrong to feel so resentful because drug addiction is a disease and not a choice. But I cut out caffeine, gave up my vegetarian diet to ensure I was getting enough protein, wouldn't lift over five pounds, drank the most water I have ever had in my whole life and I had a miscarriage, while these mothers do cocaine and heroin and don't eat for days and use dirty needles and their babies live. 

The children that I have in foster care are a different kind of pain. They are in this moment parentless children and I am a childless mother. I am often mistaken for their mother as I do things for them that mothers usually do (doctor's appointments, therapy, new glasses, Starbucks cake pops). So when they say, ""are you so-so's mother?""

We had our first appointment at 8 weeks and saw the little peanut, heartbeat flickering away. My husband cried when he saw the heartbeat because he was so happy everything was okay. (He's a crier, I think it's sweet). 

We went in for our second appointment today at 10+6. I'd finally been starting to feel a little less nauseous, a little less tired. I was excited and nervous, just couldn't wait to hear that heartbeat. 

First she tried to find it on the Doppler, she warned me that it may be too early to find and not to worry. Searching, searching... Nothing. She pulls in the ultrasound machine and does an abdominal ultrasound, I'm looking and there is nothing coming up on the screen. She says, ""I'm not seeing what I would expect to see in a viable pregnancy."" My husband started crying, I started crying. She did a transvaginal ultrasound to confirm and there was our little peanut, no bigger than before, not moving, no heartbeat. 

She said it hadn't developed any more since the last appointment. Which means that it's been almost 4 weeks without me spontaneously miscarrying, no spotting, nothing. 

So I have an appointment next week to talk with the obgyn about a D&C. 

We're devastated. I actually think my husband is taking it harder than me, I've always known that it was a possibility and I've had several relatives who have had difficulty conceiving. I don't think he ever really thought it was a possibility. 

We've been crying all day in between trying to get stuff done. Well, he's been crying a lot and I've mostly just been shutting down, internalizing. He's so good, too, reminding me not to shut down or shut him out, suggesting counseling, just being wonderful and supportive. 

I am crushed, but I know it is not uncommon and that it is not the end of our journey. I don't think it will be the last time we cry over our child, but I do hope it is the last we lose. 

So now I guess I am just waiting for a D&C and then a few months before we can try again? Neither of us really wants to wait, but I understand why it's necessary.

Ended up more disappointed than anything as I hadn't quite allowed myself to become too attached and excited as it felt too good to be true from the get go. This was our first time trying after HBC after all, it couldn't be that easy!!

As far as the actual miscarriage goes, it seems it was relatively simple, physically anyway. I bled, lightly, for a little more than 3 days. Dr confirmed HCG went from 6.3 at 5w3d to 3.5 at 5w5d. They said that is what they wanted to see, that my body was taking care of things. They recommended waiting until after I have another period before trying again, solely for dating any future pregnancy. 

I was sad and my husband and I had a couple of really down days, but we were busy. So after those couple days it seemed like we both kind of moved on. I mean, it wasn't really 'my baby' yet and I feel like I was more sad to be so disappointed because I've wanted a baby for years and Mr Furburger is older than me and worried about being too old when future babes graduate. He kept saying that it's OK and we'd try again and things would be fine. He didn't seem to ever really want to talk about it and so I guess we just left it at that. 

Every now and again, I've found myself pondering the alternate timelines and such but I try not to let myself get too far down that path because it's disappointing and distracting. Now we've reached a point where we leave for a week's vacation with most of my family on Saturday and I would have been having my first u / s this week & we'd planned on telling parents and family and such this week/next week. 

I'm also currently having my period [seems like the miscarriage was just a week ago & seems weird to be at that point already!] , so informed husband last night that we could proceed with trying again. I'm so very excited to have babies and try again. In almost the same breath, I have a very strange - seemingly irrational - fear of trying again, just to avoid future disappointment.

I *know* that I can't allow my hesitation and fear dictate things. I *know* CPs & miscarriages are common. I *know* that the chances of a healthy successful pregnancy are in my favor. I *know* that it wasn't anything I did wrong. I'm afraid of never being able to truly enjoy any future pregnancies for fear of what might happen. Part of me also feels very indifferent to the whole situation, and I feel like that's wrong. Like I can't quite find the words to describe my thoughts or feelings, except for that I am so very sorry for those of you who've had to go through this multiple times and/or at a later gestation age. I'm sorry.

Also, side rant: Who the fuck ever thought it'd be a good idea to normalize asking women if they are pregnant unsolicited should be, at the very least, throat punched. No, I'm not having a beer because I have to work early in the morning. No, I've just gotten fat after my wedding, I'm not pregnant |anymore|.

I never stopped bleeding, but when it got really heavy with big clots after almost 3 weeks, I went in, they found retained tissue, and I had a second D&C on July 18th.

Counting the first D&C as CD1, I got my period a day early on July 22nd, even while still spotting from the 2nd D&C. It was lighter than normal, but it was definitely my period (and I definitely ovulated on CD12 like normal that cycle). When I stopped spotting dark brown from my period, I got about a 12 hour break and then started spotting bright red again. It's turned into random heavier gushes over the past two days and has included a couple of small clots. I'm on CD9 of this cycle. My period ended 4 days ago, and I can already feel ovulation coming like clockwork.

I took a pregnancy test just now and got a faint positive. I KNOW I am not pregnant because I ovulated before I was cleared to have sex again after the first D&C, we used protection, and I had a period. I'm afraid I still have retained tissue, even though they did the second D&C with ultrasound and told me they were sure it was all out.

I haven't stopped bleeding for 35 days. I feel run down physically and beyond demoralized. I wish I could have just miscarried and had that been that. This drawn out whatever is happening is so. much. worse.

So what gives? I'm going to my first appointment with my new fertility doctor tomorrow (I still don't feel like that's necessary, but I digress...), and I'm going for my two week follow-up at my regular OBGYN on Wednesday, but I can't stop crying and just needed to get this out and ask, what the actual fuck is happening with my body?",t2_fzo6o,False,,0,False,Still.

106,2048,confidence,<praw.reddit.Reddit object at 0x7f12a630cd90>,,ttcafterloss,"Today is my due date for my first loss. The pregnancy that went the longest and started it all. We started trying for a baby in August 2016 last year and got our first positive pregnancy test in November. I was so happy in only took for cycles of trying. Everything was easier that pregnancy. I wasn't worried about everything, I was happy. Being pregnant obviously meant a baby was coming home. I mean I was highly aware miscarriages occurred because my sister had had two of them, but everything was going well and I didn't have any signs of anything bad happening. My dating scan was at 7 weeks and everything looked perfect. Then at 8 weeks I started bleeding. I was worried, but didn't have that bone deep fear that I have now. We went in for another scan to see if everything was alright and, amazingly, it was! Baby was perfect and wiggling around. We determined by bleeding was because of an infection. I took some antibiotics, the bleeding stopped, and everything was wonderful. I had two more scans that looked perfect, except for one small detail: every scan the baby was measuring further and further behind. I kept asking if it was fine, if I should be worried, but each nurse, ultrasound tech, and doctor told me it was fine and this often happens because the measurements are so hard to get accurately in those early weeks. So I believed them. Until my scan at 15+4 when I went in for a routine check up, haven't had any bleeding since week 10 and 2 other ultrasounds showed baby was fine. The doctor couldn't find the heart beat on the fetal Doppler, but this wasn't new for me or baby, the doctor had never been able to find the heartbeat with the fetal Doppler, which is why we always had to get the scan. So we moved back to ultrasound. And then there was my baby, looking kind of still, but I wasn't worried. I thought he was just sleeping. Until the tech left to get the doctor and then I know something wasn't right. I remember everything clear as day still, some 6 months later. She showed me how there was no flicker for the heartbeat. She showed me the brightly color scanning tool that is supposed to show blood flow and showed me how there wasn't any blood flow through the baby anymore. My poor baby was gray, while everything surrounding him was bright blue and red. Then she said those fucking horrible words, ""There is no heartbeat anymore."" What. I don't understand how that is possible. I had 4 scans showing everything was fine, how could everything all of a sudden not be fine? How could my baby have died and I have not known it? How does this fucking happen at almost 16 weeks? I was in the magical second trimester when you were supposed to be in the clear from miscarriages and pregnancy was supposed to fun for three months. I was at the doctor's office by myself, I had to hear that news by myself. And then I had to call my husband who had just got off work and was waiting at home for me and tell him the most difficult thing I've ever had to tell someone that I love. I lost the baby. I don't know how I actually managed to get through the impossible task, but I did and we cried. We grieved and we hoped the doctor's were wrong. They weren't. We ended up going to the hospital to take misoprostol and deliver the baby. It was awful, the misoprostol dilated my cervix to 4 cm and my water broke and then I had to push. It was like I was going through (mini) labor essentially, but I wouldn't get to take home a baby at the end of it. On February 15th, 2017 at 9:18am Baby Bear was silently born, weighing 21 grams and measuring 4.5 inches long. For some reason the placenta wouldn't detach, so I had to have the d&c anyways. 

After that first loss everything became about getting pregnant again. I needed to be pregnant again before my due date. And in April I got pregnant again. That pregnancy did not last long. I was spotting the entire time and at 6 weeks, it turned to full on bleeding. Fuck. My husband and I then decided we would NTNP for a couple months, just to try and reset mentally. And lo and behold we get pregnant again in June. I was so confident with this pregnancy. I felt positive that this would be my time. This would be my rainbow. I was having good, strong pregnancy symptoms, I wasn't having any bleeding or spotting, and zero cramping. I was still nervous as all get out of course, but I felt good about it. I was supposed to be almost 9 weeks today. It was supposed to make today alright. I could deal with my due date because I was pregnant again. Instead, this past Wednesday at the ultrasound, I was diagnosed with a blighted ovum. There was a gestational sac, a yolk sac, but no embryo. This hit me fucking HARD. What the hell was wrong with me? Why is it so hard to fucking carry a baby? Why can't I stay pregnant? Why would my body convince me everything is okay and make me feel tired and shitty if there was no baby in there?  

So instead of dealing with my due date being sad, but grateful I was pregnant again. I am dealing with it while bleeding and miscarrying my third pregnancy in 6 months, because my body has finally caught on that there is nothing there. And I'm just so goddamn sad and angry. So angry. I hate everyone right now, pregnant or not. I should be on my maternity leave. I should be delivering my baby boy, or I should be 17 weeks pregnant with my second pregnancy, or I should be 9 weeks pregnant with my third. What I should NOT be doing is going through this again. We will be setting up an appoint with an RE soon. I really hope they can do something for us as I really don't know how many more times I can get through this. My husband and I haven't lost hope yet, but a person can only go through so much. We have been trying for a year now and it's only been heartbreak and disappointment.

""Oh no..my baby is still in breech position! I want to do anything in my power to make the baby flip. Any suggestions? I don't want another c-section!""

""FML...the diabetes drink is horrible! Worst day of my life. LOL!""

Comments like these make my blood boil. I just want to smack them in the face and scream ""Your baby is alive! Why are complaining about such stupid shit!?"" I'd give anything to feel morning sickness again. I was so grateful to be pregnant after TTC for years. I miss being pregnant so much and these pregnant women bitch and complain about everything. 

I fucking hate people sometimes.

I was not ready to do it and know I will never be. I cried so much. All those little clothes I hung up the day before I delivered him dead. All of his diapers, towels, shoes, stuffed bears, linens, etc. He also returned some of his things for store credit. We want to ttc again and I am just so sad that all of my son's things are now getting put into boxes. I know he's never coming back and will never use those things but it is like feeling a knife going straight into my heart and get twisted, slowly, as I try to catch  my breath.

Nine months of pregnancy with nothing to show for it. I visit my son at the cemetery when he should be at home with me in my arms. 

I wonder what I have done in my life to deserve so much pain. My son was my rainbow after a miscarriage many years ago. I wonder why I was dealt this card and have to carry this lifetime sentence of pain. I know it will never go away. Time may help in some ways, but it will never take away my sorrow.

My pregnancy was one of the happiest times of my entire life, soon replaced by the saddest/most tragic event I have ever lived.

I feel like such a failure as a woman, as a ""mother,"" as a human. Couldn't even keep my son safe in the place he was supposed to be the safest.

Everyone around me seems to get to have a living child. It makes me feel so sad.

I hate that he died as he did with no cause ever found. He never deserved to die the way he did. I would have traded places with him because I've been able to live a life on this earth and he was never given the chance. It just seems so cruel.
