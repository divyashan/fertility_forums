11,2048,confidence,<praw.reddit.Reddit object at 0x7f12a630cd90>,,ttcafterloss,"I had a MC back in September at 9.5wks. I started bleeding one afternoon when I got home from work; went to the hospital and found out there was no heartbeat and the baby had stopped growing about 8wks. I'd had a scan at 8wks - everything looked good, there was a normal heartbeat, so it must have happened right after. 

This was going to be our first baby. My husband and I have been together about 10 years, but got married earlier this year and conceived first try on our honeymoon! I'm 34 and my husband is 38 so we were surprised (but thrilled) that it happened so fast. Of course we started imagining and planning our new life straight away.

I was really blindsided by the MC. This was something that happens to other people, not to me. I didn't know a single person that had had one, and nobody even knew that we had been pregnant, so it was a completely horrible, lonely and isolating experience. Of course, like everyone else on here, I went through all the usual 'why me' 'what did I do wrong' thoughts; saw babies everywhere and people announcing prenancies and felt jealousy and resentment. We were both completely devastated.

I had a D&C the day after we found out. They missed some of the tissue, so I had one excruciating night of cramps while some of that passed, then 2 weeks of bleeding. It took 6 weeks for my period to return.

We started TTC again as soon as my period was over. Because we got pregnant first go the last time, I was almost overconfident that it would happen as easily again.

I started having slight waves of nausea like I did last time I was pregnant, and was keeping tabs on my cervix which seemed to be behaving a lot like it did last time. Only thing missing was the sore breasts. I did some searching on Google and found that lots of people don't have sore breasts the second time round, so I was getting more convinced I was pregnant.

Yesterday was day 28 of my cycle. My husband had made plans for us to go to the local craft brewery after work to meet a friend, so I thought I'd better take a pregnancy test as my period hadn't turned up and I didn't want to go for drinks without knowing if it was safe.

Before I took the test I was pretty convinced it would come back positive and that I'd have to make an excuse to not go. It came back as a definite negative. I made sure I got a First Response test that's supposed to detect hCG levels well before your period is due, so I figured that it should be sensitive enough to detect pregnancy on the day my period is due. Must have imagined the nausea. Not pregnant. Disappointed. Off I went to the pub for a couple of consolation drinks.

It's now late evening on day 29 and still no period. Now I don't know if my cycle is messed up because of the miscarriage and I'm really not pregnant, or if I somehow got a false negative!?

The suspense is killing me! I'm probably being over-hopeful, but I can't help clinging to the little shred of hope. Most likely my period will arrive tomorrow and I'll be disappointed all over again :(

God, this trying to have babies thing is the biggest emotional rollercoaster!",t2_7k7tv,False,,0,False,New here! 1st cycle TTC after MC... -ve preg test :(,[],r/ttcafterloss,False,0,,0,,,False,t3_3ukufl,False,dark,1.0,,public,3,0,{},,,False,[],,False,False,,{},,False,3,,False,self,False,,[],{},,True,,1448741540.0,text,0,,,text,self.ttcafterloss,False,"<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=""md""><p>I had a MC back in September at 9.5wks. I started bleeding one afternoon when I got home from work; went to the hospital and found out there was no heartbeat and the baby had stopped growing about 8wks. I&#39;d had a scan at 8wks - everything looked good, there was a normal heartbeat, so it must have happened right after. </p>

<p>This was going to be our first baby. My husband and I have been together about 10 years, but got married earlier this year and conceived first try on our honeymoon! I&#39;m 34 and my husband is 38 so we were surprised (but thrilled) that it happened so fast. Of course we started imagining and planning our new life straight away.</p>

<p>I was really blindsided by the MC. This was something that happens to other people, not to me. I didn&#39;t know a single person that had had one, and nobody even knew that we had been pregnant, so it was a completely horrible, lonely and isolating experience. Of course, like everyone else on here, I went through all the usual &#39;why me&#39; &#39;what did I do wrong&#39; thoughts; saw babies everywhere and people announcing prenancies and felt jealousy and resentment. We were both completely devastated.</p>

<p>I had a D&amp;C the day after we found out. They missed some of the tissue, so I had one excruciating night of cramps while some of that passed, then 2 weeks of bleeding. It took 6 weeks for my period to return.</p>

<p>We started TTC again as soon as my period was over. Because we got pregnant first go the last time, I was almost overconfident that it would happen as easily again.</p>

<p>I started having slight waves of nausea like I did last time I was pregnant, and was keeping tabs on my cervix which seemed to be behaving a lot like it did last time. Only thing missing was the sore breasts. I did some searching on Google and found that lots of people don&#39;t have sore breasts the second time round, so I was getting more convinced I was pregnant.</p>

<p>Yesterday was day 28 of my cycle. My husband had made plans for us to go to the local craft brewery after work to meet a friend, so I thought I&#39;d better take a pregnancy test as my period hadn&#39;t turned up and I didn&#39;t want to go for drinks without knowing if it was safe.</p>

<p>Before I took the test I was pretty convinced it would come back positive and that I&#39;d have to make an excuse to not go. It came back as a definite negative. I made sure I got a First Response test that&#39;s supposed to detect hCG levels well before your period is due, so I figured that it should be sensitive enough to detect pregnancy on the day my period is due. Must have imagined the nausea. Not pregnant. Disappointed. Off I went to the pub for a couple of consolation drinks.</p>

<p>It&#39;s now late evening on day 29 and still no period. Now I don&#39;t know if my cycle is messed up because of the miscarriage and I&#39;m really not pregnant, or if I somehow got a false negative!?</p>

<p>The suspense is killing me! I&#39;m probably being over-hopeful, but I can&#39;t help clinging to the little shred of hope. Most likely my period will arrive tomorrow and I&#39;ll be disappointed all over again :(</p>

As my blood flow is coming in (TIM warning) small, sporadic gushes rather than a period like flow, he's wanting to see me next Wednesday. I have to have an ultrasound first (his machine is just a basic one, and both times he's sent me upstairs to another obgn who specialises in scans, who was actually the second obgn who stepped in and did the first D&C as the original was on leave ...).


Unfortunately, she can't see me that day so it's off to *another* doctor (this will be the 5th doc ...) to get a scan, then back to the obgyn a couple of hours later to discuss / review.


I repeat my HCG blood work Monday. None of the other RPL blood tests they took this week alongside the HCG have come back yet (they take a little longer).


So ..... Hopefully, this time next Wednesday a) my bleeding will have stopped, b) my HCG will have zeroed (is that likely if it was 140 the past Wednesday?), c) my scan will go well and my obgyn will be happy when he reviews it, and d) the RPL results will go well too.


Surely, *surely* this has to come to an end soon? It was the 7th Oct when we first thought we had a blighted ovum at our 7 week scan. Then 28th Oct for the first D&C. Surely, *surely* this is coming to an end?


I was doing ok today too. Feeling a bit better. Then BAM, more ""atypical recovery"" news and more poking and prodding next week.

I was around 8 weeks along. Tuesday after I got home from school I started spotting, it was dark brown so I was not concerned, but it turned to pink and eventually I started seeing red flakes in the toilet. I already knew. I waited for my SO to come home and asked to go to the ER. They took an ultrasound and they couldn't see an embryo, only a small sac. They took my HCG levels, which were only at 394. 

They sent me home saying I had to come back Wednesday morning to see the gynecologist for further testing. They said either the pregnancy was really new or it had stopped progressing earlier.

During the night I bled bright red, and they confirmed at the ER that I had miscarried. They scheduled me for a D & C this morning and I decided to go to school yesterday. While in class I felt clots come out and went to the bathroom. This morning I woke up feeling not pregnant and I had a feeling my body had expelled everything on its own.

Today at the familial planning, I told them this, and the Dr did an ultrasound. I was shocked at the way he spoke to me, he said ""Congratulations, you miscarried by yourself like a big girl, there's nothing in there, no need for a D & C"" I said ""Excuse me? That's it? When can I start trying again?"". A lightbulb went off in his head apparently because he said ""Ooooh why do you want to get pregnant again? Was this a planned pregnancy?

Anyway, so I left feeling pretty good physically, but emotionally I am shattered. I am left with so many questions that will be unanswered, it's ok, but it really hurts.

We went in, expecting to see our baby, to see the heart beat. Instead i was bombarded with many questions about how far along i should be etc. i knew inside the moment i saw the ultrasound image that the worst had happened. The last time, at seven weeks, i had seen a little flickering on the screen. My baby had been so small but i could see the heart beat. This time the screen was silent, nothing moved inside me. And then the questions. I knew before she said that there were no good news.

I had had no spotting, no cramps. My pregnancy had been easy, no nausea or nothing. The fact that a few weeks before the ultrasound the mild symptoms of breast soreness etc started disappearing seemed, to me at least, as just the end of the first trimester approaching. In my conscious mind, nothing was wrong with my baby.

But as i look back i think I intuitively or subconsciously knew. I started asking my SO if he thought by breast were still bigger, stopped wishing my baby goodnight and stopped sleeping with his/her future sweater (i had kept it at my arms length at night ever since we started trying). I just didn't know that i knew, or guessed. Its hard to explain. Has anyone of you experienced something like this?

We waited to see a doc to set up a plan on how to move forward. Waited in the same line with happy baby bumpers. I kept staring at the ceiling, just holding it all in. The moment i got in the office i burst like a volcano. There were four doctors there, one older, three younger. Oh the poor younger docs, they looked so utterly uncomfortable... And the older doc said the typical, ""it will go well the next time and the baby just didn't want to be born sick"" stuff that you get to hear over and over again when something like this happens. How can she say those things, she has no guarantees, cant tell the future and no-one will most likely never know why this happened.

I will never know if it was my bronchitis, the antibiotics, loss of appetite or bad chromosomes or my hormones not working properly. Trying not to blame myself but i just had a feeling at the start of this pregnancy that the baby was strong and healthy but that something will go wrong. Did i worry my baby to death?

I read a story a while back, when i wasn't even pregnant yet, where a woman found out about her loss in the exact same manner as i later did. The story seemed so familiar at the time. Again hard to explain.

The paper i was given said that the baby had measured at 9+5, the ultrasound lady said my baby had been dead for three weeks, so did the doc when i asked about passing everything naturally... ""Hasn't happened in three weeks, probably wont happen"". I don't get it, how is that three weeks. My baby should have measured 11w. So i am confused about that.

I was given a pill to take home and was booked for a medical abort!on two days later at the hospital. It was sad having to go through that. It was all done at the same place where you can get regular abort!ons. I felt like just another abort!ion... But I wasn't, i had lost mine, the one i wanted. I thought the pain would be worse. It hurt until i passed the sack. Then i just felt numb. And i slept.

At first my SO was great. He was feeling the pain with me. But by now he is over it, i am not. I know it will never leave me, i will never fully be the same. So now we have had a few fights and he said he would try and be better.

The last one happened, when after his grandmothers birthday i was feeling really down and then i finally mustered up the courage to tell him why. You see the thing is, his niece is pregnant. But not just pregnant, her due date is two weeks before my supposed to be due date. She told him two days before we found out our baby was dead. I didn't go to that birthday event thingy, but i asked him afterwards and yes, she had announced to the whole family of her pregnancy and yes, they had asked him about when we are gonna have children. They just are that way, especially granny. Shes asked this for years and years. So that night i asked him if it would be horrid of me, if i would want to avoid his niece for a while... And he wasn't kind. He didn't understand. Yes i get why he was upset, it is his family. But he gets to be upset while still being understanding... Well that didn't happen. I now know that there is no escaping his extended family (his parents are great) this jolly holly holiday season. I don't know how i will manage. What will i say when they ask about our plans? Where will i hide when they start discussing her nieces pregnancy? How will i hold it together, i am finding it hard even now...

My mom hasn't been much help either. She didn't find out about me being pregnant from me but from my family doc who made a mistake with phone numbers. So i got to call her and tell her my baby had died... A day before her birthday. At first she was as devastated as i was. But then came the classic things women in this situation get to hear. My favorite ones came after i shared the fight i had had with my SO. She actually said, that i should think of this as though i had had a very serious illness and i had defeated it and now had to start getting on with my normal life. Wow mom, my baby and an illness, cant think of two things more further apart from each other. Oh and the one where she said that it all should have ended the week before... So find out on Wednesday, abort on Friday and then come Monday act as though nothing happened. I know she loves me, but seriously mom, what the heck?

By now i have stopped bleeding. I feel a huge hole inside me. The emotional part of me just wants to get pregnant again as soon as possible, to fill that hole. To just have that feeling back... Of happiness and just... Looking forward to the future, getting everything you ever dreamed of. But the rational part of me knows we need to wait. We have a trip coming in  January, two weeks in Thai. What if i will need medical help, what if this happens again in Thailand... Whom will i blame then? And then there is the money issue of getting better financial support, if the baby arrives later next year (complicated national system based on previous incomes). Of Course, getting ahead of myself at that last point.

Above all i am afraid this will happen again. I am having a hard time coping, seeing carriages and babies and thinking about his nieces pregnancy. How would i manage another loss? I am afraid my fear and negativity will impact my next pregnancy, maybe even bring my fears to life. I don't know how to put a stop to them. How not to be worried and scared and afraid and anxious... And i am not even trying yet. I am seeing a midwife-pregnancy crisis counselor tomorrow. I hope she will be able to help.

So here i am, 25 and not pregnant with my first baby anymore for one week and four days. I am lost, scared and worried. But i love reading your alumni thread... It gives me just the slightest glimmer of hope. I hope it all turns out for the best for me and well you too.

It happened at the 12 week scan. We went in, expecting to see our baby, to see the heart beat. Instead i was bombarded with many questions about how far along i should be etc. i knew inside the moment i saw the ultrasound image that the worst had happened. The last time, at seven weeks, i had seen a little flickering on the screen. My baby had been so small but i could see the heart beat. This time the screen was silent, nothing moved inside me. And then the questions. I knew before she said that there were no good news.</p>

<p>I had had no spotting, no cramps. My pregnancy had been easy, no nausea or nothing. The fact that a few weeks before the ultrasound the mild symptoms of breast soreness etc started disappearing seemed, to me at least, as just the end of the first trimester approaching. In my conscious mind, nothing was wrong with my baby.</p>

<p>But as i look back i think I intuitively or subconsciously knew. I started asking my SO if he thought by breast were still bigger, stopped wishing my baby goodnight and stopped sleeping with his/her future sweater (i had kept it at my arms length at night ever since we started trying). I just didn&#39;t know that i knew, or guessed. Its hard to explain. Has anyone of you experienced something like this?</p>

<p>We waited to see a doc to set up a plan on how to move forward. Waited in the same line with happy baby bumpers. I kept staring at the ceiling, just holding it all in. The moment i got in the office i burst like a volcano. There were four doctors there, one older, three younger. Oh the poor younger docs, they looked so utterly uncomfortable... And the older doc said the typical, &quot;it will go well the next time and the baby just didn&#39;t want to be born sick&quot; stuff that you get to hear over and over again when something like this happens.

We spend the holidays with both my family and my in-laws. I'm not worried about my family, since it's just my immediate family and I am confident it will be good (it's also acceptable in my family to disappear and go curl up and read while everyone else watches football).

I find my in-laws stressful. I am aware that I have it pretty lucky, as I have heard horrible in-law stories, of course, and mine are not horrible or toxic by any means. But it's just that we have different family styles, and I've never really felt like I fit in. I get a little stressed before every holiday with them. They are big raucous gatherings with tons of extended family and random family friends.

Here's the problem I'm struggling with right now. I have agreed to go to the in-law Thanksgiving gatherings. My husband has offered to send an email to his immediate family telling them how to behave around me. The problem is, I have no idea what I want. I literally cannot picture a scenario at these parties that is okay for me. I can't picture myself talking about the miscarriage, or not talking about it, or acting like everything's okay.

My loss is very fresh and I won't be able to try for a month or so, but I am rolling the idea around in my head and heart to just sort of acclimate myself to it. Sometimes I feel like I will be ready to try again asap. Sometimes I know I just have to give myself some time to think about it. And I will. I know that this is going to be a bumpy process. 

I'm 33 and my loss was our first pregnancy. We got pregnant on the first cycle where we actually timed things well (SMEP!) and the first cycle after having my gallbladder out. I was over the moon! I couldn't believe our luck. While it hadn't taken very long at all, TTC was not without its issues and stressors. My husband developed ED, which was heartbreaking for us both. He assures me it wasn't that I was putting pressure on him, just that he was kind of freaked by the whole process and once it started, it became a self-fulfilling thing. He went to the doctor who was like, it's psychological, no drugs will help, just relax (maybe the most obnoxious advice to couples who are TTC). However, we found a creative workaround and used a medicine dropper! And it worked!

Only it didn't work out in the end. At my 10 week appointment, my doctor found an empty sac. I had a D&C a week later. Yesterday.

My doctor is gung ho about my chances for next time. They say I can basically start trying again after I get a period, assuming we're both emotionally ready. I'm in excellent health (assuming I don't fuck up my body too much with all this comfort eating and slugging out) and I discovered my cycle was fairly regular after temping and charting. 

I have a hard time dealing with optimism right now. Everyone, including my husband, says ""You will have a baby!"" but I know you can't promise anything. I wish they would say, odds are really good you will have a baby. I am occasionally feeling optimistic that my life will be okay, but I can't be optimistic that I will have a baby. I just can't right now.

So far I'm not having any side effects. I took 120mg tonight on CD 3 and will take them on and until CD 7. 

I am taking them because my cycle is so wonky. Here I was thinking I was still waiting for O and ended up having a 21 day cycle that was preceded by a 45 day cycle. I did have a MMC & D&C at the end of July but my cycles were weird before then too.

This week, I'm just pissed that I ever peed on a stick, that I ever went to a doctors appointment, that it even happened to begin with. I know what it's like to see a negative on a pregnancy test -- and sure, it sucks. But I think it sucks so much more to actually be pregnant and then...this. I could have handled a negative, I would be okay if I had just gotten a negative.

Less than an hour before I got the news of my impending miscarriage, I was telling my therapist how I would ""be okay"" if I did have one, just knowing how common it was, and how many people go on to have successful pregnancies. It is so typical for a person who has never been there to assume their reactions. I assumed completely wrong. What I thought was just a possibility is now a reality, and I am not okay. Whatsoever.

It almost feels like someone died -- because someone did die, I suppose. But it feels more like someone held a gun to my head and demanded everything I loved in exchange for my life, and after I handed it all over, they shot me anyway. 

I feel like this is how I'm paying for the ability to get pregnant quickly or to get pregnant at all. What cost will I pay to have a healthy pregnancy or to give birth to a healthy child? 

I am the product of a chick who got knocked up, by accident, by some guy that she knew for 4 months. They had a successful pregnancy (obviously) and another one, and never had a loss. My baby was the product of an 8 1/2 year long relationship, a marriage, was planned and wanted, and here I am...completely fucked, but once again, not pregnant.

&nbsp;

I posted [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/ttcafterloss/comments/3shsh6/update_to_my_mmc_36_yrs_1st_pregnancy_thanks_for/) last week. I've started a new account as reddit kept giving me an error when I tried to login today. 

&nbsp;

So ... I took a HPT on Sunday (still bleeding 2.5 weeks after the D&C) and it was a strong positive. Admittedly this sent me into a pretty bad spiral mentally. I had called the doctor on Friday re the bleeding, so saw him Tuesday (yesterday here our time) instead of waiting till December for a 6 week post-op appointment.

&nbsp;

After seeing him (and his scan machine) I was sent back up to the doctor who'd stood in for him and completed the D&C for another scan and review. Only problem was that she was having a day off, so I saw yet another doctor (the fourth in all this), after having a rather intense transvaginal scan (all up it took 2 hours including the scan / waiting time - surrounded by healthy pregnant baby bumps and literally wanting to die the whole time). 

&nbsp;

Her advice? Another D&C. Then down to the obgyn (who I must admit is lovely), who advised that tomorrow I'll have a hysteroscopy. A ""guided"" D&C with gas to inflate my (bicornurate uterus) and a camera to guide. It'll be three weeks to the day since the first D&C. And funnily enough, two months to the day since I got my positive pregnancy test.

&nbsp;

I am numb. Sad. We're losing so much time. I won't be back to TTC until next year. I don't understand why this is happening. Thank you for listening. I feel less alone. 

&nbsp;

Update: Second surgery completed yesterday morning, lots of rather alarming bleeding through until bedtime (gushes). But the nurses saw the first bleed as they helped me to the toilet, and the doctor called today and said that was ""normal"".

Hello all. Just joined this thread, figured I should introduce myself. This was my 1st pregnancy. I got my BFP the beginning of October (after TTC for about 3 months, & waiting almost 4 years to even *START* TTC). At my 1st ultrasound in early November, the baby was measuring about a week behind the scheduled time & had a low heartbeat - but I was told that it was very early in the pregnancy, & not to worry about it just yet. Our 2nd ultrasound was yesterday. The tech said it didn't look like the baby had progressed at all, & she was having trouble finding a heartbeat, but brought my Ob/Gyn in to double-check. Unfortunately, he had bad news: the baby had NOT grown since the 1st ultrasound (where it definitely SHOULD have), and there was no heartbeat. My pregnancy had turned into a miscarriage.

I hadn't had any really bad symptoms the entire time (like extreme nausea, vomiting, spotting/bleeding, cramping), but I guess I just got unlucky. I expected to have at least one miscarriage in all our TTC... I was just hoping it wouldn't be with my 1st pregnancy. :-/  
My D&C is in a couple days, & then DH & I have to wait 3 months before TTC again. I think the worst part in all of this for me isn't even just the loss, it's the fact that we have to wait so long to TTC again. It took me 3 months to conceive the 1st time (and yes, I know it's taken other women MUCH longer or involves MUCH more difficulty... I'm not trying to be selfish, I swear), who knows how long it might take the 2nd time. It means that we can't even start to try again until February (Valentine's Day, at least... woot). I know WHY we have to wait... it just s*cks so much. And while I'll have Thursday & Friday (to recover) off from work, the thought of going into work tomorrow (Wednesday) is like... Urgh. I know life will keep going with or without me, so I have to just suck it up, make the best of it, & move on the best I can... I just kind of wish I could fast-forward life JUST a tiny bit, until next year. Urgh... one day at a time, I guess.

At any rate, I know everyone here has suffered loss (or in some cases, multiple  :(  ), so thank you for letting me vent & I appreciate you guys 'lending an ear'.  <3",t2_otysv,False,,0,False,"Intro post - 1st pregnancy, 1st miscarriage (poss. trigger)",[],r/ttcafterloss,False,0,trigger,0,,,False,t3_3t7l4x,False,dark,1.0,,public,5,0,{},,,False,[],,False,False,,{},Trigger,False,5,,False,self,False,,[],{},,True,,1447824797.0,text,0,,,text,self.ttcafterloss,False,"<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=""md""><p>(X-posted to &#39;miscarriage&#39; also)</p>

67,2048,confidence,<praw.reddit.Reddit object at 0x7f12a630cd90>,,ttcafterloss,"This is the third time I've been pregnant this year.

Posting on the alumni thread didn't seem appropriate since although I am pregnant, I probably won't be for much longer. I don't want to depress everybody but I've found so much comfort in reading others' stories and feel the need to share right now.

Over three years ago I fell pregnant on the first try. Everything went really really well and we have the most incredible little kid. I always thought when parents said, ""having a child was the best thing I've ever done"" they were exaggerating or were just saying that to somehow justify all the work it takes to raise a kid. Surely it couldn't be that great? They had so say that because they can't give them back! Well, I'm happy to admit I was wrong. Being a parent has far exceeded my expectations. Our child brings us so much joy and I couldn't imagine life without them in the world.

We put off trying for another one until our child was 18 months because I didn't think I could manage the sleep depravation that comes with having 2 under 2. Little did we know we'd still be trying 18 months later.

It took 4-5 months before we fell pregnant at the beginning of this year. We didn't book any early dating scans or extra blood tests because we assumed this pregnancy would progress like the first. Prior to the 12-week scan I was a little concerned that my tummy was still flat because second pregnancies show a lot sooner, but didn't worry too much. At the scan, the first question the technician asked was, ""you took a pregnancy test?"" Not a good way to start. As she scanned silently, the screen didn't look anything like the previous 12-week scan. She brought in a more experienced tech who confirmed that there was a fetus but no heartbeat. It only measured 7w5d. We were floored, my husband more so than me. We had been dreaming and planning and coming up with names and altering our future in our heads to include another family member. Everything changed so suddenly.

After that first miscarriage so many of our friends and family told us of their losses. Miscarriage was so much more common than we realised. Those stories of loss and eventual successful pregnancies really helped us through that difficult time. I found solace in reading miscarriage stories on Reddit knowing others were going through this too.

After reading horror stories of the pills, I opted for a D&C. We waited in the world's most depressing waiting room at the Early Pregnancy Clinic (ie The Pregnancy Isn't Going Well Clinic) until a nurse came to talk us through the procedure. I was quickly booked in for surgery and it was over before I knew it. While I don't regret choosing a D&C over the pills, the operation could have gone better. I lost a fair amount of blood (750mL) and took at least 5 days to recover to the point where I could walk more than 100 meters without nearly passing out. We had just gotten Netflix so I was able to zone out on the couch all day and binge watch House of Cards.

Ten days after the operation, our dog's kidneys failed and we had to put him down. That loss was emotionally harder because he had been an actual tangible, living breathing thing of whom we had very fond memories. Just a few weeks earlier we were expecting to add to our family, and now our family was shrinking.

We waited one period after the operation to try again and fell pregnant right away. Surely this would progress as well as our first pregnancy seeing as it happened so easily this time. Sadly, no. At the 8 week scan there was nothing. No fetus. Just an empty, irregular yolk sac. We could and yet couldn't believe it. We had mentally prepared for the worst but were still saddened when the worst eventuated. How could this be happening again? What was wrong with me? 

Even though the ultrasound clearly showed no fetus, we had to wait a week to scan again. A week later my hCG levels were still increasing and the sac was growing but still not fetus. I booked in for a D&C again. The nurse at the 'Pregnancy Isn't Going Well Clinic' reviewed my paperwork and said with the information available the doctors couldn't officially classify this as a non-progressive pregnancy. Wait, what? I couldn't understand how an empty sac at 9 weeks could possibly be considered anything other than non-progressive. Did they think a fetus would magically appear? They made me take another blood test to see if my hCG levels were dropping (they were) and gave me the option of waiting or going ahead with the operation. I knew there was no chance of a positive outcome so I opted to proceed. 

By the time I went to into the operation it was 3PM and I hadn't had anything to eat or drink since the night before. I do NOT do well without food so the nurse kindly requested not one but 2 sandwiches to be delivered following my operation :-) . The operation went really well this time, no blood loss. The worst part was not being able to eat for a whole day. Although I had taken the whole week off work, I was answering phone calls the next afternoon and was back at work the day after that.

The second loss was far easier to rationalise than the first one because sure, I was technically pregnant but there was no fetus, no heartbeat, no potential baby. From the beginning we didn't get excited. We didn't talk about names, or make plans. I don't even know what the due date was meant to be.

Our first due date was early October. I thought I was over the loss but I found that time really difficult. My friend had had her baby a month earlier. We were meant to be on maternity leave together. We had a big family event the week after the due date where the family would have gotten to meet the baby. We moved my child into a big bed and disassembled the cot rather than putting a new baby in it. 

Instead of focusing on the future with a new baby, I focused on my work and career. During this time I took on new and challenging role at work, started lots of big projects, and got a promotion. Having something to focus on and projects to look forward  to really helped keep my mind occupied. We also went on a fantastic family holiday after the second loss where after not drinking for the better part of a year, I got to enjoy a fair few drinks. Even though things hadn't worked out as planned, I've been enjoying life.

Two weeks after the first due date, I saw two lines on the pregnancy test. I had already made an appointment with a gynaecologist later that week to try to figure out what was wrong with me so this was a good opportunity to have somebody other than my GP monitor the pregnancy. I went to the doctor to get blood work done to confirm the pregnancy and everything looked good. The gynaecologist reviewed my blood work, we discussed my history, and she concluded that she couldn't see any reason why this pregnancy wouldn't be the one to continue to term. She said it was common for women who have had healthy pregnancies to have one or even two miscarriages, but rare to have three. I was cautiously optimistic. She ordered another hCG test which showed my levels had increased from 240 to 800 over the course of a few days. All good! Just to be cautious, I she ordered another hCG test the following week.

Yesterday she left a message to say the levels were going up...to 1,400. I didn't get the message until her office closed so was unable to talk to her until this morning. Last night I scoured the internet to find out what the test results could mean. As I'm sure you all know, the levels are meant to double every couple of days but it had been a week and no doubling. I couldn't find any instances of slowly increasing hCG levels ending happily and would be naive to think my story could be the exception to the rule. 

This morning the doctor told me, ""the levels are not increasing as quickly as I had hoped."" ""This isn't good, is it?"" I asked. ""No, it's not,"" she replied. 

We go in for a scan on Monday and we know not to expect good news.

So, here we are. Three losses in one year. The first one really threw us for a loop but this time we're almost numb to it. During this pregnancy we've probably only mentioned the pregnancy a handful of times. We almost pretended it wasn't happening in case it didn't. My husband said, ""I'm not going to get excited until it actually happens. I don't think that's really a good thing but I don't know how else to do it."" Hope isn't really part of our vocabulary at the moment.

My husband and I have been very pragmatic throughout the year. We figure we've had a successful pregnancy before, surely it will happen again...eventually. But how many times will we go through this? One was enough, three is verging on ridiculous. I'm only 34. We have time. We can suffer more losses if they come, but how many more?

This journey has really tested our relationship and our mental fortitude. It could have destroyed us as a couple and as individuals, but it has made our relationship stronger. We know that we are each other's source of strength and we can get through anything together. We have had our sob sessions, our days and weeks where we've slipped into mild depression. 

We are grateful for what we have and want for nothing, but if life throws us a little something more, we will consider ourselves extremely lucky. 

My husband says, ""We'll get there. I love you. We're a team, the three of us."" We look at our child and marvel at how amazing this little person is. If we can give them a little brother or sister, great. If not, it's not the end of the world. We have our child, our health, each other. We will get there. We just don't know what 'there' looks like  yet.

Thank you for letting me share my story.

For those of you who have had multiple losses, does it get easier? What steps can I take to figure out what's wrong? Is there anything else to do apart from keep trying?

Three pregnancies this year.,[],r/ttcafterloss,False,0,intro,0,,,False,t3_3t5dos,False,dark,0.87,,public,11,0,{},,,False,[],,False,False,,{},Intro,False,11,,False,self,False,,[],{},,True,,1447791509.0,text,0,,,text,self.ttcafterloss,False,"<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=""md""><p>This is the third time I&#39;ve been pregnant this year.</p>

<p>Posting on the alumni thread didn&#39;t seem appropriate since although I am pregnant, I probably won&#39;t be for much longer. I don&#39;t want to depress everybody but I&#39;ve found so much comfort in reading others&#39; stories and feel the need to share right now.</p>

<p>Over three years ago I fell pregnant on the first try. Everything went really really well and we have the most incredible little kid. I always thought when parents said, &quot;having a child was the best thing I&#39;ve ever done&quot; they were exaggerating or were just saying that to somehow justify all the work it takes to raise a kid. Surely it couldn&#39;t be that great? They had so say that because they can&#39;t give them back! Well, I&#39;m happy to admit I was wrong. Being a parent has far exceeded my expectations. Our child brings us so much joy and I couldn&#39;t imagine life without them in the world.</p>

<p>We put off trying for another one until our child was 18 months because I didn&#39;t think I could manage the sleep depravation that comes with having 2 under 2. Little did we know we&#39;d still be trying 18 months later.</p>

<p>It took 4-5 months before we fell pregnant at the beginning of this year. We didn&#39;t book any early dating scans or extra blood tests because we assumed this pregnancy would progress like the first. Prior to the 12-week scan I was a little concerned that my tummy was still flat because second pregnancies show a lot sooner, but didn&#39;t worry too much. At the scan, the first question the technician asked was, &quot;you took a pregnancy test?&quot; Not a good way to start. As she scanned silently, the screen didn&#39;t look anything like the previous 12-week scan. She brought in a more experienced tech who confirmed that there was a fetus but no heartbeat. It only measured 7w5d. We were floored, my husband more so than me. We had been dreaming and planning and coming up with names and altering our future in our heads to include another family member. Everything changed so suddenly.</p>

<p>After that first miscarriage so many of our friends and family told us of their losses. Miscarriage was so much more common than we realised. Those stories of loss and eventual successful pregnancies really helped us through that difficult time. I found solace in reading miscarriage stories on Reddit knowing others were going through this too.</p>

<p>After reading horror stories of the pills, I opted for a D&amp;C. We waited in the world&#39;s most depressing waiting room at the Early Pregnancy Clinic (ie The Pregnancy Isn&#39;t Going Well Clinic) until a nurse came to talk us through the procedure. I was quickly booked in for surgery and it was over before I knew it. While I don&#39;t regret choosing a D&amp;C over the pills, the operation could have gone better. I lost a fair amount of blood (750mL) and took at least 5 days to recover to the point where I could walk more than 100 meters without nearly passing out. We had just gotten Netflix so I was able to zone out on the couch all day and binge watch House of Cards.</p>

<p>Ten days after the operation, our dog&#39;s kidneys failed and we had to put him down. That loss was emotionally harder because he had been an actual tangible, living breathing thing of whom we had very fond memories. Just a few weeks earlier we were expecting to add to our family, and now our family was shrinking.</p>

<p>We waited one period after the operation to try again and fell pregnant right away. Surely this would progress as well as our first pregnancy seeing as it happened so easily this time. Sadly, no. At the 8 week scan there was nothing. No fetus. Just an empty, irregular yolk sac. We could and yet couldn&#39;t believe it. We had mentally prepared for the worst but were still saddened when the worst eventuated. How could this be happening again? What was wrong with me? </p>

<p>Even though the ultrasound clearly showed no fetus, we had to wait a week to scan again. A week later my hCG levels were still increasing and the sac was growing but still not fetus. I booked in for a D&amp;C again. The nurse at the &#39;Pregnancy Isn&#39;t Going Well Clinic&#39; reviewed my paperwork and said with the information available the doctors couldn&#39;t officially classify this as a non-progressive pregnancy. Wait, what? I couldn&#39;t understand how an empty sac at 9 weeks could possibly be considered anything other than non-progressive. Did they think a fetus would magically appear?

I'm 26F and my husband is 28M. We have been married for almost 5 years. We started trying almost 2 years ago on New Years Day. As soon as we started trying is when I started having problems with my cycle being funky. I went months at a time with no cycle. My doctor wanted to run tests but at that time we had so much going on that it was hard to take time off work. We were in the process of buying our first home plus working overtime at work, I just never got around to start the testing. We planned on waiting till the 2 year mark of ttc to go back and start the tests. 

That's when it happened, mid October I took a test and for the first time ever it was a BFP! My husband and I were ecstatic. The clear blue test I took said I was 2-3 weeks. At 4 weeks we told our immediate family as his parents were in town and we weren't going to see them for some time. It would have been the first grandchild on both sides so of course our entire family couldn't believe it was finally happening.

At the beginning of November I started having cramping and ended up having a natural miscarriage the same day. My husband brought me to the ER because he wanted to make sure I was ok. Ultrasound and blood tests plus a follow up appointment the next day confirmed it was a spontaneous miscarriage. My OB didn't really take much time to talk to us at the appointment other than to confirm what happened, make sure I was not in pain, and told us to wait 2-3 months. 

My boss was aware of what was happening because we are very close so she told me to take a few days off. I was handling everything wonderfully till my husbands best friend texted my husband saying that his 19yo gf that he has been with for 6 months was pregnant! That was the one time that I truly broke down. How is it that I can do everything right and want so much to be a mommy but can't and people who don't even try get pegnant can do so so easy?!? It hurt so bad but I picked myself up and realized that going through this just means that when I do finally become a mommy I will just appreciate and cherish my baby that much more.

Fast forward to now, I know the doctor said to wait but last night I decided to start trying again. I was not far along and bleeding stopped last week. I feel physically fine and emotionally I'm ready to try again. I will be switching doctors after this coming up appointment because I do not like my current OB. My husband has been nothing but wonderful and so supportive. None of my friends have children or are even married yet so other than my husband and family I don't really have anyone to talk to. We didn't tell anyone about the miscarriage other than family and my boss so I stumbled across this subreddit and I feel so at home. In 1 day I have read posts from the last like 5 or 6 months. It's great to hear everyone's stories.

Thank you from the bottom of my heart.

&nbsp;

I thought I'd update y'all as to where I'm at. I started the SSRIs (low dose) Saturday. My obgyn / GP / psychologist all agree this is a-ok for now and into future TTC and beyond. The GP is very much giving me agency over whether I choose to continue them (he's reviewing me next week to see if I have managed to turn a corner, if yes, that's me not the meds as such and I could choose to discontinue). In saying that I *think* it's wise for me to give them a chance. The fertility specialist in August was suggesting that my anxiety / PMS was problematic enough to recommend SSRIs at that stage (before we knew we would go on to get pregnant the next month) and had written as such to my GP. 

&nbsp;

I guess I'm struggling to put **me** first in all this? I have also finally gotten a short course of sleeping tablets (after getting around 9 hours total sleep Sun-Tue) and after a couple of good nights sleep and 6 days of SSRIs and a therapy session? I am still reeling in shock and sadness, but a bit numb too. And after how I felt this past few weeks? Numb is ok. 

&nbsp;

I have started running again (so slow!) but I'm proud of that, back to healthy eating too. I also had my [MTFHR gene](http://www.mthfrsupport.com.au/what-is-mthfr/) tested as well. I carry a single copy of the MTHFR A1298C heterozygous gene. I'm getting conflicting information about what to do with my prenatal vitamin regime so finally spoke to the obgyn today. Whilst he *can* send me to a geneticist, with my mutation he sees no need and says normal prenatals are fine. However, my psychologist feels that I should avoid folic acid (man made) and take folate (natural) to aid absorption and to alleviate anxiety. There are links to anxiety / folic acid consumption and carrying the gene mutation. My lovely (and patient) obgyn today said that he's happy for me to see a naturopath and switch to a folate based prenatal. As long as I'm getting iodine and folate he's happy. 

&nbsp;

I go and see a naturopath recommended by my psychologist Saturday. One of my psychologist's other patients is doing IVF, found out she carries the gene mutation, switched her prenatals and her anxiety lifted measurably. That kind of gives me hope? I know, I'm clutching at straws.

&nbsp;

It's day 14 since the D&C today and whilst I bled the day of the procedure, I only spotted for the next six days until (what *felt* like my period) bleeding came on. It was stop start up until last night but felt like a period. The obgyn said my experience is a-typical and it *might* be my period and feels confident, if I want, to start having unprotected sex after the bleeding stops entirely. 

&nbsp;

Now this is in direct contrast to the advice both the obgyn, his colleague who performed the procedure AND my GP all said initially. Wait a cycle. I'm so confused. I just want our lives back to normal. What would y'all do?? Wait and use protection? Just start back as normal?

&nbsp;

I should add that I will see the obgyn for a post op check up at the six week mark (11th Dec) and no one has said I need a blood test for HCG levels. Just that they'll go down within a few weeks. I've not dared to take a pregnancy test either. Any advice ladies??

Please don't read any further if you're looking for something positive--it's definitely not here. It's also expletive-filled, but I don't see anything in the sidebar about that, so I'm going no-holds-barred on this.

Life (or whatever it is that's fucking me over), you handed me a shit deal when you took Grace from me at 22 weeks. For what reason? I'll never know. You send me to the most cautious perinatologist this world has to offer, who recommended we wait 12 months before considering trying again. Everyone else in my loss group were given the green light at after a cycle or three, so it seemed ridiculous. But I held fast to his recommendation, because if I lost another child, I would always look back and think how I should have listened to that archaic advice.

After waiting for a year, lo-and-behold, a positive test on our 3rd cycle! The heavens have opened up and sprinkled nothing but joy and luck upon us! I called my doc, scheduled my appointment, and off my husband and I went for our already-scheduled vacation, but now with a reason to celebrate. 

And then you waited. Until after my vacation, while I'm sitting at the gate to go home, you pulled the trigger. You waited until there was nothing I could do but sit on a plane and sob, with nothing to prevent the evidence of my loss going through my underwear, all over my jeans. You're a real asshole, you know that? As if that wasn't enough, I'm told to go to the ER to spend time and money knowing what we already knew... I wasn't pregnant any more.

Oooh, but you tricky trickster you. You let me google all these threads that said,""Oh, I had a CP but got pregnant my next cycle! You're hyper-fertile after that! I'm a billion weeks pregnant now!"" You must have these people on your payroll, making sure to give false hope to everyone who's stupid enough to hope for something better. Or worse yet, you allowed me to be stupid enough to believe that I'm like everyone else.

Well, well, well. Two cycles later and it's another chemical. You were even more cruel with your timing that go-round. You let me get my blood drawn first (how courteous of you) before slamming down your hammer of injustice that night. With each subsequent pregnancy you let me get further and further along before you rip the carpet from beneath me. 

But this, you son-of-a-bitch, this is far more cruel than I could have imagined you could be. I waited! I waited for 7 days and 7 positive tests, all getting darker and darker, before I even let my husband know. I held off for as long as I could to give you time to decide whether you were going to show your cruelty again. And when it seemed like you had enough of me, I called the doctor, scheduled my appointment and I felt that all this pain and suffering... it was coming to an end. 

But you aren't done, are you?

You have me bleeding every single day. And not the ""No Need to be Alarmed Pink"" or ""Brown Blood is Old Blood"" shades every pregnancy website writes about. No, you have given me every shade of red imaginable. The starting and stopping and varying degrees of heaviness--your coup de grace, I assume? 

Okay. It's done. You've fucking won. You've taken another one from me. 

5 weeks and 66 hcg. Bleeding. No symptoms. The overly-sympathetic nurse who has to read me my test results and avoiding saying what's obvious. The numbers are too low, and ""it's not looking good"". Those fucking words. Every. Single. Time.

So Life (or whatever it is that's fucking me over), I get it. You really have something against me. I am no big fan of yours right now either.
