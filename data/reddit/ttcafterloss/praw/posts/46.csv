21,2048,confidence,<praw.reddit.Reddit object at 0x7f12a630cd90>,,ttcafterloss,"I have been reading on here for awhile but this is my first time posting. In March my husband and I lost our daughter at 34 weeks and delivered via emergency c-section. There were some complications during pregnancy with intermittent bleeding, growth and the cord insertion site so I spent the third trimester worried but still full of excitement to meet her as we had a confident medical team and additional scans. Nothing could have prepared us for the shocking complications at the very end which at this point I am not ready to discuss in any more detail. 


We had just had our baby shower two weeks before, still had the banner with her name over the fireplace, a completed nursery, all the clothes folded and sorted by size. When we came home from the hospital it was all there but we didn't have her. I feel like at that moment my life was divided into two sections. Before and after the loss. She was our first child so we came home to our two dogs and otherwise silence. 


The first few weeks we had family visiting and cooking for us. I was on painkillers and anti-anxiety medicine and was grieving very hard but otherwise very out of it and I hardly remember that first month. I had already left my job in my third trimester to rest and prepare for her arrival and was planning on getting a new job when she was 6 months old. I didn't have to leave the house for awhile so I posted up on the couch with my dogs, took my pills and tried to eat when I could. My husband went back to work after a few weeks and I began three months of healing physically after the surgery and having therapy multiple times a week before looking for work again. My doctor let me know that due to the surgery we would have to wait 6 months to try again, which has been incredibly hard as I have the strongest feeling of needing to be pregnant again and due to my age I am in a panic that pregnancies could become harder to achieve or be more complicated. 


I started my new job 6 weeks ago. My husband and I spent 8 days on vacation in Australia, a trip planned in May. I thought the new job and the vacation would help with the grief but since returning from our trip I have spent the last week in the deepest depression since March. I have so many triggers. Seeing photos of or hearing about babies of the women that were pregnant at the same time as me is the hardest. One sister in law has 4 girls ranging from 1 - 5 years old. Two other sisters in law are recently trying and it seems like every other woman at work is either pregnant or coming back from maternity leave with baby stories. I can hardly get in an elevator without being around expecting women. I cry about it almost daily because seeing them is like seeing a mirror reflecting the inverse of my life, the opposite outcome of my horrible loneliness and pain without my daughter


Another thing I am struggling with is the lack of support I have received from friends and family. After the first few weeks of our loss people stopped asking how we were or asking about our loss. My friends grow silent and change the subject if I bring it up, even though I only do extremely carefully and thoughtfully. People openly talk about their babies or other babies loudly and with with glee, in detail like how they are eating their first solid foods or taking their first steps. People brag about healthy pregnancies, using the word healthy, when they know exactly what I went through. Nobody has stopped to ask if what they are talking about might be hurtful. It seems like people have forgotten or don't care and it makes me so sad that I feel like throwing up when it happens because the grief is so overwhelming. I am kind and supportive and rarely bring up what happened but i wish people would be more thoughtful. 


I am open to advice on how to deal with triggers and the feeling that I am unsupported by the people in my life. I have appreciated reading this sub occasionally when I can bring myself to. It's hard because my husband and I are not even talking about TTC until the end of this month, and it could be months or longer until we are actually able to try. There are a lot of painful variables. 


Thank you for listening.

I was 9 weeks and went in for a routine ultrasound and we found out that it was a twins, and b that they had stopped growing at 6.5 weeks. I elected to have a d&c, as I did not want to wait to naturally miscarry, and had it July 20th.  Everything went well I was feeling pretty well until the following Tuesday, so 5 days post op. I started having cramping and heavier bleeding. The next day I worked, and I was feeling pretty crappy, bad cramps. I work in the ER (3p-3a) so I came home from work that morning and when I woke up around 1:45 passed a grapefruit sized clot.  It was concerning but I thought ok I'll go to work and call the ob's office.  I got to work and began passing more baseball sized clots and my co-worker made me check in to be seen. They diagnosed me with retained products of conception, offered to admit me, I declined, and they gave me a dose of methergin.  I went home passed one more very large clot and then it stopped.  They checked my hcg at that time and it was 611.  That was the only one I had done during this whole thing.
I believe I ovulated around August 12/13th, as I had positive OPKs and other fertile signs.  I was stupid and took a test 10dpo and got a faint positive.  I believe it was residual from the miscarriage, but perhaps it could have been a chemical too.  I took one 10, 11, and 12 dpo and had faint lines.  I got my period at 14 dpo.  We will be trying again this month, as I was told I did not have to wait. I've been having long cycles and the cycle before and during which I conceived I took soy isoflavones and they helped shorten my cycle and move my ovulation from day 28 to day 18.  We have a 2 year old daughter and it took three months to get pregnant with her, and it took five months for this last one.  
I think I am doing relatively ok, it just hard to move on from the I should be x number of weeks pregnant this week.  As a nurse in the ER I see many pregnant women, and it is frustrating.  I know many of these women aren't trying, and its just hard for me to be around pregnant people right now.  I hope that it gets easier as it goes on.

Last week I had a dating ultrasound which should have been 9w was measuring 6w and no visible heartbeat. It wasn't really possible to be at 6w since I got all my positive tests before I would have conceived, but we did anther ultrasound yesterday to be sure baby wasn't growing and sure enough it was still measuring 6w. 

So my two options were to wait to miscarry on my own or take pills to induce the miscarriage. I'm deciding to take the pills to get it over with and so we can move on and ttc asap. It makes me so sad to take pills to induce a very wanted and planned for pregnancy. 

DH and I are going on a vacation in November and I was supposed to be just over half way there. I know that's stupid but I was just so looking forward to showing on that trip. Now I'll either be in first tri or worse not pregnant yet. I'm angry that we have to start over. I'm hurt that I'll never get to meet this sweet baby of ours.

30,2048,confidence,<praw.reddit.Reddit object at 0x7f12a630cd90>,,ttcafterloss,"Hi Everyone. I was here for a bit earlier this year when I had a MMC around 6 weeks. Waited to pass it naturally but ended up taking misoprostol around 9 weeks. That pregnancy was a result of our first IUI, we had tried for eleven cycles prior to that. 

After the miscarriage we tried just timed sex for four cycles, and then did two unsuccessful IUIs. We were taking a break from treatment to decide what to do next when we got pregnant again in July from just sex. A huge happy shock! And even better, I was pregnant during the due date from my last pregnancy. Which just felt, right? I don't know. 

Obviously we were very cautious after our first loss and tried not to get excited until after the ultrasound. At the 7 week ultrasound, I had convinced myself the pregnancy wasn't viable. I had few symptoms, and just didn't feel pregnant. So I was mentally and emotionally prepared for bad news. To my surprise, the baby was there, measuring right on track, with a perfect heartbeat that we got to hear. It was truly one of the most incredible experiences of my life to hear that little heartbeat. I could not believe it. We scheduled a follow up u/s for one week later before my RE would release us to an OB. 

Well, all the stats say that your risk of of miscarriage is drastically reduced after you see a heartbeat. And so, I let myself get excited. I started planning when we would announce, looking into a midwife practice, making notes on my calendar about when I needed to do things. I was really confident. 

Unfortunately at our follow up ultrasound on Monday, there was no heartbeat. I decided to have a D&C so that we could send off the embryo for testing, because I'd really like to know if something was wrong. We are obviously devastated. I'm asking a lot of questions. Why? What was the purpose of getting to hear the heartbeat when it was just going to die? Why couldn't we have gotten the bad news two weeks ago when I was prepared? How is it possible that we are in the very small percentage of couples who miscarry more than once? What is wrong with us? Our doctor is going to start us on RPL testing now, which I hope will give us some answers. 

While I'm mourning the loss of this baby, I'm also just so defeated. Trying to get pregnant has been the most miserable (almost) two years of my life. I'm exhausted at the idea of trying again. How long will it take this time? And if we succeed again, I have to try to make it through another first trimester. How many losses will I have to endure? How do people do this? 

Anyway, the D&C was yesterday and it went well. Although I'm not really cramping or bleeding much, so I don't know if that is normal? I'm also feeling pretty numb about it. Besides yesterday, I haven't really cried. Like, I know that I'm heartbroken, but my brain won't even let me go there. Must be survival mode.

I was previously on the march2018bumpers, but after going in at my first ob appt with my new dr with what I was supposed to be 8 weeks, there was no heartbeat. The past few months have been a whirlwind. I elected to switch OBs after my skepticism with his office staff dwindling and referring out for ultrasounds to SimonMed. The only problem was that I was already 4 weeks pregnant and  wasn't an established patient and with my new provider so I knew if there were any issues I'd have to defer back to my old OB. I think you can all well imagine things weren't textbook and started spotting at 5 weeks and two days later had a huge bleed. I had two ultrasounds the first showing a flicker, but unable to count HR and the second showing a hr of 118. I was so thrilled, but soon lost all my pregnancy symptoms which weren't terribly strong to begin with. Well a week and a half after seeing the heartbeat I had my new ob appt where there was no heartbeat anymore. He insisted on checking with the ultrasound tech with her machine and same story.

I just lost my second babes, first was in 2015. I was previously on the march2018bumpers, but after going in at my first ob appt with my new dr with what I was supposed to be 8 weeks, there was no heartbeat. The past few months have been a whirlwind. I elected to switch OBs after my skepticism with his office staff dwindling and referring out for ultrasounds to SimonMed. The only problem was that I was already 4 weeks pregnant and  wasn&#39;t an established patient and with my new provider so I knew if there were any issues I&#39;d have to defer back to my old OB. I think you can all well imagine things weren&#39;t textbook and started spotting at 5 weeks and two days later had a huge bleed. I had two ultrasounds the first showing a flicker, but unable to count HR and the second showing a hr of 118. I was so thrilled, but soon lost all my pregnancy symptoms which weren&#39;t terribly strong to begin with. Well a week and a half after seeing the heartbeat I had my new ob appt where there was no heartbeat anymore. He insisted on checking with the ultrasound tech with her machine and same story.

After my 4th CP in early July, my gyno referred me to a genetic counselor.  After our initial consultation the genetic counselor suggested that husband and I can consider chromosome analysis and carrier screening.  Chromosome analysis may not be covered by insurance (though the counselor said they could make an argument for us after 4 CP/MCs) and it would typically take a week to get the results back.  Meanwhile carrier screening is commonly ordered by OBs anyway, and it would typically take a month to get the results back.

At the time I was about 5 weeks into my fifth pregnancy so husband and I decided to hold off on both tests and re-evaluate if we have another miscarriage.  Long story short, we're having a fifth miscarriage.  Already spoke with my OB who will refer me to an RE after this miscarriage is complete.  I expect that I won't get to see my OB until 9/19 the earliest.  When I asked my husband if he'd like to move forward with the two tests suggested by the genetic counselor, he preferred to wait until after our first RE appointment to see what tests they order.

I'd be fine with waiting on the chromosome analysis since it only takes a week for results to come back, but the month's wait for carrier screening has me feeling impatient.  Since we're waiting for the miscarriage to end anyway, I feel like we could make use of the time to get that test done and out of the way. I know we would still need to wait if fetal testing is required, but at least the first half of the screening is already done.  While we would of course prefer not to spent a crazy amount of money on ""elective"" testing, money in itself is (fortunately) not a factor.

What are your thoughts?  If I'm just being impatient, please do let me know!

**Update 8/31:** Called OB's office to scheduled the follow up appointment to check that the miscarriage completed.  It won't be until 9/19, which gives my uterus plenty of time to get rid of everything, but hopefully not enough time for an infection to form should it not.  Also got the RE's office number.  It's not a single RE, but a group of them who work in the reproductive medicine department.   Called the reproductive medicine dept, gave the receptionist an overview of the situation, and asked if I should go ahead and do the tests.  Unfortunately she couldn't give me a straight answer on whether to proceed with the tests unless I'm registered as one of the RE's patients.   I assume this is for legal/liability/HIPAA reasons, so I didn't press.  She did offered to register me as a patient with an RE of my choice, but I didn't know if my OB would refer me to a specific one and didn't want to inadvertently step on his toes, so I said I'd wait until after seeing him.

I then sent an email to the genetic counselor and asked if she'd suggest I proceed with the tests she recommended, or if I should wait until after talking to OB/RE.  I'm assuming that she'll say something similar to what she told me at my last appointment, that it's up to me whether to do the testing through her office or the OB/RE's... in which case I'm just going to move forward with the testing.  Looking back, I probably should have just gone for both tests after our initial consultation.

I've been thinking a lot recently about how music has been with me through my loss and wondered if anyone else has had any similar experiences. I hear lyrics from songs I've heard hundreds of times before and they have new meaning, or new songs that kinda describe my grief or even help me feel better about things. Some make me cry my eyes out, some make me smile and everything in between. 

I think my first difficult interaction with music after my loss was choosing funeral songs. We had the following songs played:

Walking into the chapel: [Johnny Cash - You Are my Sunshine](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGa3zFRqDn4)

Reflection: [Maxence Cyrin - Where is my Mind? (Pixies cover)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ts7FQaVULRs)

Walking out: [Smashing Pumpkins - Farewell and Goodnight](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XXalcFWgLy8)

I was playing Fallout 4 recently (video game...) and heard Skeeter Davis - End of the World, in a completely new way. I know it's a love song more than anything else, but most of the lyrics felt like a punch in the gut: 


I wake up in the morning and I wonder.

Why everything is the same as it was.

And I can't understand,

No I can't understand how life goes on the way it does.
Why does my heart go on beating?

Why do these eyes of mine cry?

Don't they know it's the end of the world?

It ended when we said goodbye.

At other times it's just a song I'd sing along to in the car and smile thinking he might be able to hear me (and how bad I am at singing!) I guess music has always been a big part of my life and it's helped me in some ways after my loss.

I was in the ER all day yesterday because they were concerned about my slow rising betas, and was confirmed something is in my right ovary/tube. My options were emergency surgery or methotrexate and I opted for the shot. 

So now I am waiting and am so terrified. Any methotrexate stories and experiences are welcome. It sounds like in the next 12-24 hours I'll have bleeding, cramping, nausea.  I'm nervous it'll be really bad and I'll have to go to the ER. My pregnancy was very small though and they were very hopeful the medicine will work. I am just so sad and so mad this is happening to me. It really sucks. It's awful that anyone has to go through this. This group brought me a lot of comfort in June for my first loss, I am so thankful for all of you. 



Update with my experience in case it's helpful to anyone-

So my shot was Sunday night around 9. Monday I felt normal. Tuesday I felt like I got hit my a bus. Random mild cramping. Just tired and achey like I had the flu. Wednesday a little achey in the morning but by the afternoon I felt really good. Still no bleeding at this point since the previous Wednesday. 

Today is Thursday and this morning I had one strong cramp and then finally started spotting. This afternoon I had heavier cramping but nothing worse than a bad period cramp. Then a lot more bleeding. I left work and now that I am home I see some pretty big piece of tissue thing came out of me and it's gotta be the fetus or whatever. Makes me so sad :(

52,2048,confidence,<praw.reddit.Reddit object at 0x7f12a630cd90>,,ttcafterloss,"On August 11, our first son was born. At the anatomy scan at 20 weeks he was diagnosed with a complex heart disease, Tetralogy of Fallot. We spent two scary weeks waiting for a chromosome test, because this heart disease is associated with a certain chromosomal complex. The test came back negatively and we decided wholeheartedly to proceed with the pregnancy. Tetralogy of Fallot in itself can be mostly fixed with surgery and after that our son could expect a mostly normal life. We did everything we could to prepare ourselves for the time to come. We knew he would spend his first weeks in the NICU, because he would probably need a medicine to regulate his blood flow.
A couple of days before our due date our gyn decided it was best to induce, so we had to stay in the hospital. But at the time there was no room in the NICU, so we had to wait 3 days before the actual induction could start. Labor actually went rather well according to my wife, and our little boy Hidde was born. His start was rather good, with Apgars of 8 and 9, so there was time for him to be with his mother for a couple of minutes and for me to cut the umbilical cord. After that he was brought to the NICU, given an ultrasound and hooked up to all the machines.
Following this were 11 roller-coaster days. We could visit him 24/7, but it costs a lot of energy to be at the NICU. But after a few days we settled into a sort of rhythm which seemed to work for the three of us. We could wash him, change his diapers, we tried some breastfeeding, but this was rather tiring for him.
The cardiologists decided he needed surgery as a temporary solution. For the more permanent surgery to correct all the defects he would need to be older, about half a year, but to be able to make it to that age he would need a shunt between his aorta and his pulmonary artery.
We were visiting him the day before that, a day with a lot of talks about the surgery scheduled. He was lying on my wife's breast, and apparently the line for his medicine was blocking up. Not a big problem, this happened before, a lot depended on how he held his arm. So we put him back in his bed, and the nurses tried to make sure the line stayed free. One of the side effects of his medicine was that it made him a bit more sensitive. He was mostly used to us touching him, but he didn't like it to much when he was handled to much. After a while he started crying, which wasn't that unusual, but rather than stopping after a few cries he went on, it became worse, and suddenly he started turning blue...
The doctors were rushed in, and for 45 minutes they tried to reanimate him. We were present for the first part, scared out of our minds, people rushing by, no-one who really took note of us. We left, not knowing what to do. One of the nurses found us, and after some time one of the doctors came, telling us it was best if we were present now, to see for ourselves they did everything they could. And they did, when we left there were 2 doctors, by now at least 9 people were standing around him, giving chest compressions, trying to figure out what was wrong with our little boy. But whatever they tried, it didn't work. And so came the world shattering moment when they brought him to us and laid him on my wives lap...

We still have to wait for a full genetic test to be sure about this, and of course try to make some kind of peace with what happened to us.",t2_12bol3,False,,0,False,[Introduction] Lost my son after 11 days,[],r/ttcafterloss,False,0,intro,0,,,False,t3_6whwuh,False,dark,0.97,,public,43,0,{},,,False,[],,False,False,,{},Intro,False,43,,False,self,False,,[],{},,True,,1503934322.0,text,0,,,text,self.ttcafterloss,False,"<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=""md""><p>On August 11, our first son was born. At the anatomy scan at 20 weeks he was diagnosed with a complex heart disease, Tetralogy of Fallot. We spent two scary weeks waiting for a chromosome test, because this heart disease is associated with a certain chromosomal complex. The test came back negatively and we decided wholeheartedly to proceed with the pregnancy. Tetralogy of Fallot in itself can be mostly fixed with surgery and after that our son could expect a mostly normal life. We did everything we could to prepare ourselves for the time to come. We knew he would spend his first weeks in the NICU, because he would probably need a medicine to regulate his blood flow.
A couple of days before our due date our gyn decided it was best to induce, so we had to stay in the hospital. But at the time there was no room in the NICU, so we had to wait 3 days before the actual induction could start. Labor actually went rather well according to my wife, and our little boy Hidde was born. His start was rather good, with Apgars of 8 and 9, so there was time for him to be with his mother for a couple of minutes and for me to cut the umbilical cord. After that he was brought to the NICU, given an ultrasound and hooked up to all the machines.
Following this were 11 roller-coaster days. We could visit him 24/7, but it costs a lot of energy to be at the NICU. But after a few days we settled into a sort of rhythm which seemed to work for the three of us. We could wash him, change his diapers, we tried some breastfeeding, but this was rather tiring for him.
The cardiologists decided he needed surgery as a temporary solution. For the more permanent surgery to correct all the defects he would need to be older, about half a year, but to be able to make it to that age he would need a shunt between his aorta and his pulmonary artery.
We were visiting him the day before that, a day with a lot of talks about the surgery scheduled. He was lying on my wife&#39;s breast, and apparently the line for his medicine was blocking up. Not a big problem, this happened before, a lot depended on how he held his arm. So we put him back in his bed, and the nurses tried to make sure the line stayed free. One of the side effects of his medicine was that it made him a bit more sensitive. He was mostly used to us touching him, but he didn&#39;t like it to much when he was handled to much. After a while he started crying, which wasn&#39;t that unusual, but rather than stopping after a few cries he went on, it became worse, and suddenly he started turning blue...
The doctors were rushed in, and for 45 minutes they tried to reanimate him. We were present for the first part, scared out of our minds, people rushing by, no-one who really took note of us. We left, not knowing what to do. One of the nurses found us, and after some time one of the doctors came, telling us it was best if we were present now, to see for ourselves they did everything they could. And they did, when we left there were 2 doctors, by now at least 9 people were standing around him, giving chest compressions, trying to figure out what was wrong with our little boy. But whatever they tried, it didn&#39;t work. And so came the world shattering moment when they brought him to us and laid him on my wives lap...
We spend the next couple of hours just holding him, washing him, clothing him for the first time, making little footprints. We buried him yesterday, and are trying to figure out what to do now. We already said to each other we would certainly like for him to have a brother or sister at some point. We still have to wait for a full genetic test to be sure about this, and of course try to make some kind of peace with what happened to us.</p>

OB wasn't worried though since it  was still early enough to not see anything.  He took a beta draw that day before I left, then I went back two days later for a second draw.  My hCGs for both draws were ~5100 and ~5200 respectively, and with such a low rise after 48 hours my OB pretty much explained that there is a 99% chance that this pregnancy will end in a miscarriage.  This would be my fifth CP/MC.  OB was very apologetic and told me that I should start bleeding in 2-4 weeks, then gave me instructions for what to do after I stop bleeding as well as if after 4 weeks nothing has happened.

Well, today I am technically 8+0 and aside from my nipples no longer being insanely sensitive to everything and a few brief bouts of what I assumed were cramps, nothing seems to be happening.

* Lifted really heavy shit down four flights of stairs (I spent the first 3 weeks of August moving between apartments)
* Got pinned to a wall by a really heavy and bulky couch pressed up against my abdomen

* Walked a whole bunch

I'm hesitant to do anything that would adversely affect but not necessarily end a pregnancy in case I fall into that 1% where despite shitty hCG levels the maybe-baby is actually going to survive... even though objectively that is most very likely to not be the case as I have no symptoms that could remotely be attributed to pregnancy.

Or should I just be patient?  For those who've (unfortunately) also been told of an impending miscarriage in mid first trimester, what was your experience?  This limbo really sucks. =(

It was a missed miscarriage though the baby had passed away just a day before at 11+4. Had to have a D&C. Through testing discovered I have Hashimoto's and PCOS. After this miscarriage, I kind of fell apart. I was beyond distraught and this sub really helped me. 

Got pregnant in September 2015 and my amazing daughter was born in June 2016. When she turned a year we started trying again and got pregnant again on the first try. First pregnancy was also first try. From beta #1, I'm been anxious. Progesterone was 17, with my daughter is had been 24. But hcg rose well. Second ultrasound at 7 weeks we were told the sac was small (this is very bad and significantly increases miscarriage risk) but baby kept growing and having a strong heartbeat. At 9 weeks went to the RE for spotting and baby was fine, no sign of bleed. At 10 weeks, went to ER for bleeding. Again baby was fine, discovered a small subchorionic hematoma. No one was concerned. Saw my OB 2 days later and baby looked great, SCH was barely visible. 4 short days after that I start bleeding profusely and cramping so bad I can't walk. Go to ER and we were told the miscarriage is almost complete. I've barely passed any clots before coming in so I guess I did while bleeding in the hospital bed. Waiting to hear if I will need another D&C or if I can continue to naturally. I'd already mapped out my strategy if this happened (I'm type A) which has helped me process. I'll be joining you all in the daily boards again. 

EDIT: Ended up having to have a D&C due to my bleeding that wouldn't stop. Was discharged in the early AM and then fainted when I got home.

At 9 weeks went to the RE for spotting and baby was fine, no sign of bleed. At 10 weeks, went to ER for bleeding. Again baby was fine, discovered a small subchorionic hematoma. No one was concerned. Saw my OB 2 days later and baby looked great, SCH was barely visible. 4 short days after that I start bleeding profusely and cramping so bad I can&#39;t walk. Go to ER and we were told the miscarriage is almost complete. I&#39;ve barely passed any clots before coming in so I guess I did while bleeding in the hospital bed. Waiting to hear if I will need another D&amp;C or if I can continue to naturally. I&#39;d already mapped out my strategy if this happened (I&#39;m type A) which has helped me process. I&#39;ll be joining you all in the daily boards again. </p>

<p>EDIT: Ended up having to have a D&amp;C due to my bleeding that wouldn&#39;t stop. Was discharged in the early AM and then fainted when I got home. My husband called an ambulance but my vitals were good and they said I didn&#39;t need to go back to the hospital unless it happened again.</p>

This is baby number two; our first child passed away when she was 30 days old. We got pregnant the first time, only two months after going off birth control! The pregnancy was normal until I developed Pre-eclampsia and HELLP syndrome in my third trimester and had to have an emergency c-section.

It took us 6 months after losing our daughter before we were ready to try again, but during that whole time I didn't have a single period. I reached out to my OBGYN and she put me on Progesterone to force it. We then spent 6 months dealing with my erradict 76 day cycles. We've spent the last 4 months on clomid which have made my cycles a semi normal 36 days. When I asked her to refil my clomid prescription my doctor said she didn't thinks she could help me and she felt like our next step was IVF and referred me to a few fertility clinics in the area. 

I feel like she's rushing to IVF. Besides a battery of blood tests, trying to figure out why I suddenly developed Pre-eclampsia, I haven't undergone any testing regarding fertility. I also can't help but wonder if maybe something went wrong during my c-section and she isn't telling me.

Still on the TTC journey. Before I got pregnant, I was diagnosed with Bipoar II disorder at a fairly young age. I was on medication for 17 years. When we started TTC, I got off of my medications. (At the time, a combination of Lithium and Lamictal, as well as Xanax and Ambien for anxiety and sleep.) Weaning myself off the meds wasn't very difficult even though I had been on that cocktail for about four years. I actually did really really well off of meds and didn't really notice a ton of difference. When I got pregnant I noticed that I tended to get very emotional, but that's pregnancy.

Unfortunately, we lost our daughter at ten weeks. I had to have a D&C. I was doing okay up until the actual procedure. Unfortunately, someone accidentally let in a pro-life ""religious official"" into my room after a nurse spotted funeral forms on my file. The lady came in right before I was wheeled into the procedure and started asking me if I knew what my dead baby was going to look like after the D&C. DH and I were both horrified, and luckily the doctor came in to get me as she was talking. I went through the procedure, and woke up crying hysterically in the recovery room and pleaded with the doctors to hold my baby. They didn't say anything, but gave me a sedative.

It was a really horrible process that haunted me. I didn't heal quickly and ended up with some complications from retained materials. A week after the D&C, I was at work when I started hemorrhaging in the women's bathroom. I was taken to the hospital where they flushed the rest of the placenta out. I bled for about a month until things started to get back to normal. We started TTC when my doctor said it was okay, which was 3 cycles ago. During the first cycle, I had a disappointing CP probably caused by the thin lining. The cycle after that was anovulatory. Luckily, I did ovulate on the most recent cycle. I was sad to not be pregnant, but at least my body was back to normal. 

It's been almost 4 months since my D&C. It doesn't sound like much, but it feels like forever. I had originally decided to not go back on medication because I wanted to TTC again quickly. But, I'm finding that maybe that wasn't the best choice. While I did well before the MMC off of my meds, it seems that the experience brought my mood down a lot and is still affecting me. For the first three months, I had severe nightmares and could not sleep. My memories were really pervasive and would be triggered throughout the day constantly every time I looked at something baby related. There are some days where I cry for hours at a time, and others where I feel like I can't get out of bed. I'm not really interested in anything anymore other than TTC again. Every month that I get a BFN, it is crushing to me because I get so hopeful during the TWW. It really hurts. There isn't a day that goes by where I don't think about our daughter and what happened. Sometimes I experience anger and sadness towards other people when they talk about their own pregnancies or babies. My heart just takes a dive completely. 

I have made several changes in the past few months to help with the depression. I dropped down to part-time work to allow more times to book doctors appointments and to relax. I have been seeing a therapist once a week since the D&C. I have become more diligent in taking proper vitamins and my Synthroid along with Metformin. (although I have gained 20 pounds since I first got pregnant) and I have started to get acupuncture. I even got a dog, which unfortunately was stolen by my mother and ended up causing more harm than good for my emotional health. Sleep has also been an issue. I work nights and tend to fall asleep around 2am and wake around 6am. And then I try to get myself back to sleep around 10am-1pm. Not a great schedule to work with.

Despite changes, I haven't been able to shake most of the depression. All of those little things have helped, but I have not noticed any significant improvement. I'm thinking it may be time to go back on medication again. However, I don't want to go back on Lithium, because I have Hashimoto's disease. I have been told that Lithium can aggravate it. So, I'm looking for alternatives to try. Ideally, I'd like to get on a medication that I will not gain more weight on and that would be fairly easy to stop once I get pregnant. I also will probably go back on Ambien for sleep, because that's been a big problem for me. 

Ladies who have gone through this before, what experiences do you have with medications for mood stabilizing after loss?

In April I got the devastating news at my 20 week anatomy scan that my baby had passed. I had a d & e preformed because I figured it would be easier emotionally than giving birth. Since then I've had 3 cycles (on my 3rd currently). Each cycle I've had a really heavy period that lasts about 3 days, stops and then a few days later I get a random gush and then that's it for a few days. Then in the middle of my cycle around when my apps say I should be ovulating I get this weird brown spotting and sometimes a little red too. This is my first month using opks (using clearblue advanced). Today and yesterday I received blinking smileys. I am starting to wonder if I'm experiencing ovulation spotting? I am not temping but I definitely plan to do it next month to make sure I am actually ovulating because I fear I am not. The strange spotting is accompanied by light cramping/slight inflammation feeling in the ovary/pelvic area. My cycles have been about 32-35 days long. I have never really been regular before but I don't recall having mid cycle spotting like this. I have 2 kids already whose pregnancies were perfect.

Something most of y'all don't know... I didn't just lose this baby during this ectopic pregnancy. 

May 8th was one of the happiest days of my life. It was the first time I ever had a positive pregnancy test. I told Austin and within days he came home with a cute onsie and baby converse sneakers. We were so excited.. so overjoyed! We told close family immediately. Almost everyone couldn't be happier for us! Then it happened.. I became the one in 4. I went to the er on May 22nd and found out I was having a miscarriage. By may 27th I had passed everything. I had lost our first child. My body couldn't handle it. Couldn't do it's one job and protect our baby that we already loved SO much. I'd thought about writing something on here.. not at all for pity.. but for awareness. For me. It was a life I felt people should know about. Even if no one ever got to meet him or her.. our baby was so loved and so worth knowing about. I hate that miscarriage is so common, and SO heartbreaking, yet women feel like it has to be a secret. Like they aren't allowed to discuss it. I stayed quite about it. Cried for weeks. Let my body heal a little bit.. 

Then, it happened again!! So fast too! I was cautiously optimistic. This one would stick. I could get excited but not too excited. And this time I had so many more signs.. I was so nauseous. I hated the taste of Dr pepper. I couldn't brush my teeth without gagging or dry heaving. I threw up. Surely these were good signs... right? Every pain and sickness made me happy because it meant that I was pregnant. 

And then the day happened.. I saw blood again. I lost it. Cried so hard! This couldn't be happening to us again!! I went to the ER August 3rd to find out my hcg had dropped and I was having my second loss in only 3.5 months.. 

But this time it wasn't just a loss of a baby. It was a loss of a tube. The near loss of my own life.. some might say I'm being dramatic and I say I'm not expressing myself enough. Not only am I physically hurt right now, I am emotionally crushed. And you know what? That is okay. I'm not asking for pity. Just awareness. This happens to so many women who feel they can't speak up about it when it's actually a common thing. 

Here are some things I have been told since all of this has happened..

""At least they happened early""

""At least you are young and have plenty of time to make more""

""This is just probably cause it's not God's time for you to have kids yet""

""At least this gives you more time to focus on yourselves""

""Its probably a sign that you should wait for a while""

While all of those hurt so bad, most painful one is the clueless, ""so when are y'all going to have a baby?"" 

Because they don't know that we don't know either.. that we try and my body just won't seem to allow it. That we thought we had and then we didn't have anymore... that we already lost 2 precious babies.. that we don't know when.. we don't know if we'll get to ever see our next baby. No one expects a miscarriage or loss. It just happens. Just cause I never knew their gender or saw their face doesn't make it hurt less.. in fact it hurts more because I will always wonder who they could've been..

 just please think before you speak.. because words do hurt.. be aware that it's a common thing but that doesn't make it hurt any less. And when you find out someone has had a loss, Don't try to say something to cheer them up.. because most of the time that will hurt them worse. Just apologize or say nothing. Hug them. Let them know you love them. That you're a shoulder to cry on if they need it. 

I hate that women feel like they can't tall about it. Like they have to keep their babies life a secret. I had two babies. And they didn't live for long, but they were loved. And their lives and their stories are worth knowing about.

<p>&quot;This is just probably cause it&#39;s not God&#39;s time for you to have kids yet&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;At least this gives you more time to focus on yourselves&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Its probably a sign that you should wait for a while&quot;</p>

<p>While all of those hurt so bad, most painful one is the clueless, &quot;so when are y&#39;all going to have a baby?&quot; </p>

<p>Because they don&#39;t know that we don&#39;t know either.. that we try and my body just won&#39;t seem to allow it. That we thought we had and then we didn&#39;t have anymore... that we already lost 2 precious babies.. that we don&#39;t know when.. we don&#39;t know if we&#39;ll get to ever see our next baby. No one expects a miscarriage or loss. It just happens. Just cause I never knew their gender or saw their face doesn&#39;t make it hurt less.. in fact it hurts more because I will always wonder who they could&#39;ve been..</p>

<p>just please think before you speak.. because words do hurt.. be aware that it&#39;s a common thing but that doesn&#39;t make it hurt any less. And when you find out someone has had a loss, Don&#39;t try to say something to cheer them up.. because most of the time that will hurt them worse. Just apologize or say nothing. Hug them. Let them know you love them. That you&#39;re a shoulder to cry on if they need it. </p>

<p>I hate that women feel like they can&#39;t tall about it. Like they have to keep their babies life a secret. I had two babies. And they didn&#39;t live for long, but they were loved. And their lives and their stories are worth knowing about. </p>
