I have lurked here since my CP in October, but have hesitated to post until now. During that dark time many of your stories touched my heart and helped me cope. I want to properly thank you all. ❤

Now here I sit, in the TWW of our fourth viable cycle, pouring over my old charts. And I am suddenly reliving my first cycle. It was long. It was confusing. And it was the first time I ever saw a line on a pregnancy test.

The story goes like this: FF was telling me I was 15DPO on a 53 day cycle. I wasn't confident in FF's ovulation estimate and desperate to know SOMETHING. So I dipped a wondfo in my FMU and saw... nothing? I can't remember if it was really nothing. At the time I had never heard of a squinter. I thought a positive was a nice dark line. Either way something encouraged me to dip a ClearBlue+ in that same pee cup. This time I saw a pale blue plus sign almost instantly.

I remember my hands shaking. I remember frantically calling my husband. Crying happy scared tears. I was cautious, but overwhelmed with hope.

I got a FRER and took it after work. Stark white. Negative. I couldn't understand. I thought I was losing my mind. I asked my husband if I was crazy, thankful to have taken a photo as proof, that yes, it was really there.

Some internet searching, and the chatter on some other, frankly terrifying forums, convinced me that blue dye tests always turn positive and it was definitely not real. I was never pregnant.

AF came the next day.

Next cycle: faint positives started at 12DPO, and lasted until I got AF at what would have been 16DPO. I knew then to avoid the blue dye and was in many ways blessed to see two brands turn positive. I knew I was pregnant. I didn't have to wrestle with that doubt. I could let myself grieve.

But now that I have more knowledge under my belt, I look back at that first cycle and wonder. Of 5 cycles tracked- 3 had a 13 day LP, 1 was a CP with a 15 day LP, and one was the cycle in question with an estimated 16 day LP.

Was that first cycle actually my first CP? It's the only other outlier in my pool of data. And while I know that I will never know for sure, I feel like I need to come to some conclusion in my heart so that I can move on.

I would love to hear your thoughts--on my data, or on my feelings. I may be being unrealistic with myself. I was able to push it out of my mind for the last three cycles, so maybe I should just try to let it go. 

I guess I just feel like my TWW is haunted by the ghosts of these dreams that never got to become babies. And I don't know how I'll feel if I get another positive this time.

* What would you do differently next time? What kind of monitoring would you offer? 
* Could this indicate a health problem I need to be concerned about? 
* What are your thoughts on immune issues as a cause for pregnancy loss? Would you treat empirically with prednisone? Lovenox?

Hi everyone. I have been lurking for a while and commenting in some other posts, so I thought I would share my whole story here.

My husband and I started ttc after our wedding in Feb 2014. We were incredibly optimistic and half expected to get pregnant on honeymoon. We became discouraged after a year with no luck and then had 9ish months of abstinence as it totally killed our sex life and we were both too scared to speak about it. Bad times. Anyways, we sorted it out and embarked upon ttc again, this time with a game plan.

I started temping and charting in the quiet months before and figured out my cycle length was 32-34 days. I got so in tune with my body that I started being able to actually feel ovulation happening. We had a bfp in Feb 2016 and were so excited! Then I started bleeding at 10 weeks and went to the hospital. They couldn't see anything because of my tilted uterus and said to come back in a week. I went home that day and miscarried.

We were so devastated at the prospect of starting all over again, as it had been 2 years since our wedding. It took a while to settle into life ttc post mc and to learn how to be happy again. My 4.5 yo niece kept saying devastating things like ""Your baby died so you're not fat anymore"" or ""When your baby dies, you can have another one!"" It made me really resent my brother and sister in law for telling her in the first place.

Both of my sisters-in-law were also pregnant at the time which was difficult to handle. They gave birth to my sweet nieces in early August. Then I got the surprise of my life a few weeks later - a bfp! We couldn't believe I got pregnant on cycle 3 after my mc!

Seeing a little heartbeat on the 12 week scan was such a happy moment. At 20 weeks, everything looked great and we found out that baby was a boy! At 22 weeks, I went for another growth scan because they couldn't see his spine at 20 weeks. It was then that we found out that his femur length was in the 5th percentile and got a referral to a specialist.

At 23 weeks, we saw the specialist who confirmed the femur length and suspected an issue with the placenta. As there were no other markers for anything else, we opted not to have an amniocentesis and the specialist set an appointment for 26 weeks. At 24 weeks, just before NYE, I started to feel really sick. I'd had vomiting and painful diarrhoea the whole pregnancy, but it got really bad. On New Year's day I couldn't even stand up because I just felt pressure downwards. I also had a pinching sensation on the left side of where my anterior placenta was. I called the midwives and they suspected flu even though I had no temperature, so I stayed in bed all morning. I kept feeling waves of pain which I now realize was early labour, but I convinced myself it was the flu.

Then my water broke at 1pm. I was hysterical, but when we got to the hospital, an ultrasound confirmed that our baby was still alive in there. All of my pains stopped but they told me I was 3cm dilated so they transferred me to a specialist regional hospital just in case I went into labour. I went in an ambulance and my husband went home to get me some clothes as mine were all soaked in amniotic fluid.

I got to the hospital and went into full on labour. Nothing to 100% in five seconds. My husband hadn't arrived yet, so I was panicking which made it way more scary. They were struggling to do everything at once - set up an iv drip, take my blood pressure, cool me down, and listen for the baby's heartbeat. There must have been 8 people in the room. Then a doctor told me that there was no heartbeat and had to repeat himself and ask me if I understood because I just couldn't grasp it. My husband arrived then and I told him our baby died. After that I cried my way through an hour of labour and delivered our stillborn son, Leo.

That was two weeks ago and I still can't believe it's happened. I look at myself in the mirror and still see a big belly, only now I hate it. I wake up in the night on my stomach and panic that I'm squishing the baby, even though there's nothing in there. I feel angry that we're back to the start again, after 3 years of trying.  But most of all I just feel profoundly sad.

38,2048,confidence,<praw.reddit.Reddit object at 0x7f12a630cd90>,,ttcafterloss,"Hi all. I've been around this sub for a while but I haven't made any posts, just comments. Until now. 

I just turned 31. I had a miscarriage at 6w in May 2015. I ended up being put on birth control to get the bleeding to stop. Six months later, I was off birth control, and my husband and I started trying again. I got a positive test in August 2016 but lost the baby again at 6w.

Since then, we've continued to try. I've had all sorts of blood work done. I've been using OPKs and temping. 

Before I ever got pregnant, I was clockwork 28 days. I'd never been so much as a day late. After I went off birth control following the first loss, my cycle returned to clockwork 28 days. 

Since the second loss, I've ranged from 34-45 days. My emotions are out of control. My periods are heavier than I've ever experienced. 

My insurance doesn't cover infertility, so my doctor has ran all sorts of blood work and such, but really can't give me a reason for my losses or trouble conceiving. 

When my next cycle starts, he's having me take Clomid (50mg) and then if there's a temperature spike indicating ovulation, I'm supposed to immediately start progesterone. I'm pretty sure I've been ovulating this entire time, but according to the OPKs, it's random and different every month, and doesn't line up with other ovulation symptoms. I don't get a temperature spike until 3 or 4 days after the OPKs start getting fainter, and I've never had one get to what I would actually consider positive for longer than 2 hours. 

So I guess my questions are 1) does anyone have a similar story to this and 2) what should I expect from clomid? My emotions have been terrible since the second loss. I honestly think I'm struggling with depression, but I also have intense anger. I've only been at my job for about 4 months, and it's been stressful lately, and I guess I'm concerned that clomid is going to make my emotions even worse and I'm worried I can't handle it. I guess at this point I'm seeking any advice anyone might have for me.

This is my second loss, I guess, though I hadn't really counted the first one. The first one I didn't even find out that I was pregnant last summer until I was in the ER finding out that I had an ectopic, so I never got excited to start with. I guess that's why I didn't count it. But now that I'm losing another, it really feels like twice all of a sudden. 

They never found my ectopic. So many ultrasounds and so much monitoring and a D and C and they just couldn't ever find out where the pregnancy was, so they just gave me the methotrexate. It made me really sick for a few days and then I went back in and I was still pregnant and they still didn't know where so I had to do it again. Fortunately it worked that time, after being even more sick for even longer, because next up would have been some scary exploratory surgery. 

I found out I was pregnant again last week and went in for immediate blood tests and the hcg more than doubled in two days that time and we instantly got excited. Then the cramping and spotting started today and so we did it again and the hcg cut in half, so I guess I'm just losing it. 

My OB told me today that it might be better to wait a cycle before trying again but she understands if I want to try again immediately. See, my husband and I only have half the year each year to try. His work takes him away half the year each year and we don't want to have any babies during that time frame any year. 

So we only have a few more months to try this year.

Quick BG: I had a MMC at 7 weeks at the end of December (Merry Xmas to me) and a D&C a few days after. I was JUST starting to feel like my body was totally normal both emotionally and physically when I started to feel a cold coming on. It was mostly sinus and sore throat so I kind of didn't think anything of it until my eye started hurting and got blurry.

Well....I have pink eye. For the first time of my life at age 31, I got pink eye, and to top it all off...today my second eye got infected. So basically now I'm applying drops to both and still feeling shitty with a sore throat and stuffy nose. I rarely get sick, but I feel like my immune system hasn't been the same since I got pregnant in the first place.

I was 13 weeks along and the baby was already showing major birth defects and growth problems, a clear indicator that it would likely not survive to full term. We consulted at length with a genetic counselor and doctor and decided to terminate the pregnancy. Part of me considered waiting until the baby died naturally but I decided it would be too painful given our history, past losses and ages (I'm 36, husband is 40). 

We've been trying to have our first child for over four years and conceived this baby via IVF. I also had a miscarriage in Dec. 2013 (conceived naturally, MC at ~7 weeks) and an ectopic/pregnancy of unknown location in Dec. 2015 (conceived via medicated IUI). We were really hopeful that this pregnancy would work out since it was the farthest we'd ever gotten (13 weeks), but it wasn't meant to be.

I had a D&E yesterday and feel like I should feel more sad. Instead I'm just numb, almost like my mind is pretending nothing happened. Has anyone else felt this way? Part of it might be that I didn't allow myself to get too attached to the baby since we've already been through so much loss, and I wasn't showing yet so I kind of ignored the fact I was pregnant. I figured once we had the early scans and got confirmation that all was well, then I would let myself relax and try to enjoy the pregnancy and prepare for baby.

I hope this is the right place to post. I am a newly 23 year old, going to grad school this fall. My boyfriend of 3 years lives in another state working on his first year of med school. We're long distance for at least 3 years. I did not at all have pregnancy on my mind until this week - I've had an IUD in place for 2 years. Long story short, Monday night I was in the ER having emergency surgery due to a rupturing of a surprise ectopic pregnancy. I lost my right Fallopian tube in the process, and due to timing I went through the whole thing - my first surgery - alone. Trying to look up support seems to focus more on the loss of the actual pregnancy which totally makes sense, but I'm trying to come to terms with the loss of the tube and what that could mean.

If you'd asked me before this, I would have told you an accidental pregnancy meant termination (I apologize if this is at all upsetting). My boyfriend and I had long agreed on this. Now I can't stop thinking about what I'll do if this event ever happens again since the chances are higher, if I lose the other tube... or if I have another ""normal"" accidental pregnancy, thinking if I terminated and later the first *planned* one caused the left tube to be lost... it's nothing but ""what if""s but now they're all right in my face. Especially since there's a fair chance any future pregnancies could be with the same man as now. My boyfriend is being as supportive as possible seeing as he's been on a Hawaiian cruise for this whole thing and I won't see him until next Thursday. To a point though he can't fully understand why I'm as upset as I am, or why this is going to be on my mind for so long.

I was doing what I considered to be the most reasonable thing to combat pregnancy having the IUD, and it failed me in a serious way. My body beat ridiculously low chances of even getting pregnant, only for it to then fail such that I am now going to spend the next however many years until I actively try terrified that it may not happen. I rationally know I can still get pregnant with 1 tube, and many women do not struggle albeit it perhaps taking longer. But others do, and I just don't know what'll happen. I am heartbroken to lose a piece of what feels like my womanhood, and I can't decide if that doesn't make sense. And now I have concerns about how my feelings in the event of a second unplanned pregnancy may possibly have changed. 

I'm not sure where I'm going with this. Mostly just looking for anyone who had an ectopic pregnancy end this way, and how the future panned out for them. The good and the bad. Or just how to categorize my thoughts to seem less scared. I'll take anything.

112,2048,confidence,<praw.reddit.Reddit object at 0x7f12a630cd90>,,ttcafterloss,"My question is about the first cycle after an early natural MC. I read a few comments here and there that it's common for the first cycle to be strange and to experience cramping. Question is how do you differentiate between just a ""typical"" (whatever that means) post MC cycle versus a uterine infection?

I had an early (5+weeks) natural MC about 4 weeks ago. I only bled for about 6 days and the cramping was only painful in the first day (I passed the biggest clots only a few hours into the cramping). My OB did an ultrasound on the 5th day of the bleeding and said that MC was completed and everything looked fine, she did however prescribe me a 3 day course antibiotic ""just in case, as a preventative measure."" Well... I decided I know my body better and since the bleeding stopped one day later and I no longer had cramps or anything, I didn't take the antibiotic. 

Well... 1DPO (cycle day 15) I had terrible cramps. Really really painful. They felt a lot like the MC cramps, and they were definitely around my uterus area. They were so painful I took tylenol (which I very rarely do. I don't like painkillers). The cramping lasted 2 days and it went away. At that time I didn't know it was 1DPO and was freaking out. Then, a few days later, FF gave me crosshairs and I figured: well, it was 1DPO so maybe it was just ovulation cramps, made worse due to the MC...

Then... 2 days ago (12DPO, cycle day 27) the cramps started again and are still going on. Except now, the pain isn't located around the uterus but higher, in the guts. It just feels like stomach bug + pre-period cramps (which for me is chills - I always have chills before my period arrives). However, no period. So, basically, I'm confused as to what the fuck is going on in my body. Is it just a 'normal' thing to experience post MC?

Another thing... because of the strange pain/cramping, I decided to do a urine dipstick test (I have a box of urinalysis sticks from something unrelated) and decided to check it out. Well, imagine my surprise when the urine test showed white blood cells present (there should be none) which indicates infection - usually a UTI (however I have no UTI symptoms whatsoever). Anyway, that's when I started getting worried. I tested again this morning and the white blood cells are still present but in lesser quantity. Cue in me looking into whether this could be something that happens in early pregnancy (why, yes, it could). But together with the cramps it definitely has me worried - and my DH this morning went: ""Oh shit.. remember the doc prescribed you antibiotics you never took."" I had totally forgotten about it and now I'm freaking out about actually having a post MC infection and the painful cramps being a symptom of it. But if that was the case I'd had the painful cramps earlier, no?

Sorry for so much story, but I just have no idea what the hell to do. The soonest I can see my OB is Monday. I could go to a GP and they'd probably give me antibiotics for a UTI but they're usually clueless about stuff like MC and gyne stuff. On the other hand, if cramping post MC is 'normal' then I might just be freaking out for nothing.

We had an ultrasound today to check baby girls progress. 

The tech was pretty nice making conversation and all. But I kept watching the screen and I couldn't see any movement myself. 

The tech then went to let the doc know she was done and told us he'd be in soon. 

I was already super worried since I had barely felt her kick the last 2 days. There was no pulsating heart. Nothing moved. I knew that wasn't right but I pushed those thoughts away. I didn't want it to be true. 

The doc came in and scanned himself. He checked the blood flow thing and there was nothing to see. 

His first words were ""Did you experience any bleeding or cramping?"" 

I told him ""no!"" Still hoping our biggest fear hadn't come true. 

He then told us that it seems like we lost the baby sometime before this appointment. 

I told him that I had just felt her kick in the car. And he said that is possible. Or that I mistook something for a kick. He can't tell us when it happened. 

I'm grateful that the doctor and nurses and technicians at the hospital were so very kind to us. But I'm completely shattered. 

I'm scheduled for an induction tomorrow at 9 am. I'm so terrified. I feel sick and nauseated. I don't want this nightmare to be true. I had just felt her kick. I want to hold my baby and tell her everything will be ok. I want to do the nighttime feedings, the teething, the poopy diapers. Instead we'll be going home without our little girl.

I have a healthy, almost 7 month old daughter. Why would I even be trying again so close, correct?

Well it started out when we got unexpectedly pregnant between 3 and 4 months postpartum. We had been doing a very cautious form of coitus interruptus, but apparently it wasn't enough. I even posted about it on reddit elsewhere because I was in such disbelief. We ended up losing the pregnancy around 7 weeks.

We made sure to use condoms, etc. the cycle after, and after then we thought -- well, maybe we'll go for it. We wanted our kids closer together for a variety of reasons, my now 6 month old daughter was taking to solids and already on the path to self-weaning, etc. So we tried. And we got pregnant. And it's now resulted in a chemical pregnancy.

I know I have a healthy, living child. I know I am not in the trenches in the way some of all of you are. And I know I'm fortunate to have gotten pregnant so easily -- but it still hurts. That initial pregnancy was like an absolute sign to me because of so much that was going on at the time in my life... but then it was gone. Then to actually try after thinking I crossed my t's and dotted my i's and lose it is demoralizing.

I've read that losing pregnancies isn't correlated with breastfeeding, or even proximity to last live birth -- that not ovulating is how the body shows it's not ready, not getting pregnant and being unable to carry it. My thyroid levels are different now than they were before I conceived my DD, but my endo didn't think they were off enough to be an issue and we're changing the pill I'm on there anyway.

I'll apologize in advance for the word vomit that may happen, I need to get this out.

So, here's my story: (tw - stillbirth)

My husband (29) and I (30) were very surprised when we found out that we had conceived on our first try in March this year. Everything was going well, no morning sickness or nausea, just really bad heartburn starting around week 20, no big deal. Found out we were having a baby boy and started preparing everything. We were *almost* done putting all of the finished touches on the nursery.

Friday night, Nov 5, right before bed, I realized I hadn't felt him move in a while but DH assured me that it's happened before and he was probably just sleeping. The next day, I started pulling everything out to pack into my hospital bag, picked out his going home outfit, packed the diaper bag, and the car seat was ready. He still wasn't really moving. As a FTM, I figured he was just getting himself into place an running out of room. I had a growth scan scheduled for Monday and figured everything would be fine. Sunday comes around, and I wake up with a sick feeling in my gut. He stopped moving. I called L&D and was told to go get monitored.

The nurse gets out the heart monitor and starts moving it all over my belly. At this point, I look at DH and start freaking out. She tells me she's going to get the midwife on call to perform an ultrasound. There's no heartbeat. What happened next felt like something you only see in movies when a mother loses their child. I screamed so hard that I scared myself.

I was induced and given all the pain meds possible and an epidural. Right before it was time to push, the midwife on call (who was absolutely amazing at calming me down through this shit storm) told me something that I'll probably never forget. She told me that he was going to be perfect.

He was perfect. Born sleeping 37w2d at 7:40am on Monday, November 7, 2016 weighing 4 lbs. 8 oz. He had my hair and my nose. DH and I are completely heartbroken.

They said I had a textbook pregnancy and don't know what happened. I have a consultation with MFM this coming Friday to get the autopsy results. I'm not sure what kind of questions I should have ready for this appointment. I'm scared. I'm sick of crying. I'm sick of hurting. I'm sick of everyone treating me differently and ignoring me. I just want my baby.

I was very active on TFAB for the last year. We found out we were pregnant in early December after our first IUI. I was shocked that it worked the first time, and elated to have a positive just a few days before my 31st birthday and weeks before Christmas! I couldn't believe our luck. 

Unfortunately, at our 6 week ultrasound, just before Christmas, the baby was measuring a week behind. I spent the week of Christmas in anxious limbo, expecting the worst and hoping for the best. At our follow up ultrasound this past Thursday the baby had only grown two days and our doctor told us the pregnancy wasn't viable. I stopped my progesterone shots that night. 

We are absolutely devastated, to say the least. We were actively trying all year for this baby and each month we were unsuccessful was so hard. Then, to have received this wonderful gift only to have it taken away is unbelievable to me. Honestly, its made me question everything I believe about God and life and how I see the world in general. 

I've had to get off social media because I absolutely cannot bear to see the Christmas and New Year baby announcements. Its killing me. 

I still feel pregnant, with sore boobs and nausea. I was hoping my body would start the process on its own relatively soon after stopping progesterone. But I think I'm going to call the doctor on Monday to schedule a D&C to just so I can get it over with. 

My doctor said, ""silver lining, we know you can get pregnant now, this is good news."" My husband says, ""we will try again right away and make another baby."" But I wanted this baby. I wanted this one to work. What was the purpose in even getting pregnant if it was going to end like this? I'm seriously struggling. Not only have I lost this pregnancy, I've lost hope and joy and I feel like I've lost my faith. Not to mention the lost time that puts us even further behind our goal of becoming parents.

<p>I was very active on TFAB for the last year. We found out we were pregnant in early December after our first IUI. I was shocked that it worked the first time, and elated to have a positive just a few days before my 31st birthday and weeks before Christmas! I couldn&#39;t believe our luck. </p>

<p>Unfortunately, at our 6 week ultrasound, just before Christmas, the baby was measuring a week behind. I spent the week of Christmas in anxious limbo, expecting the worst and hoping for the best. At our follow up ultrasound this past Thursday the baby had only grown two days and our doctor told us the pregnancy wasn&#39;t viable. I stopped my progesterone shots that night. </p>

<p>We are absolutely devastated, to say the least. We were actively trying all year for this baby and each month we were unsuccessful was so hard. Then, to have received this wonderful gift only to have it taken away is unbelievable to me. Honestly, its made me question everything I believe about God and life and how I see the world in general. </p>

<p>I&#39;ve had to get off social media because I absolutely cannot bear to see the Christmas and New Year baby announcements. Its killing me. </p>

<p>I still feel pregnant, with sore boobs and nausea. I was hoping my body would start the process on its own relatively soon after stopping progesterone. But I think I&#39;m going to call the doctor on Monday to schedule a D&amp;C to just so I can get it over with. </p>

<p>My doctor said, &quot;silver lining, we know you can get pregnant now, this is good news.&quot; My husband says, &quot;we will try again right away and make another baby.&quot; But I wanted this baby. I wanted this one to work. What was the purpose in even getting pregnant if it was going to end like this? I&#39;m seriously struggling. Not only have I lost this pregnancy, I&#39;ve lost hope and joy and I feel like I&#39;ve lost my faith. Not to mention the lost time that puts us even further behind our goal of becoming parents. What a shitty way to start 2017. </p>

<p>Anyway, thanks for reading and letting me vent. I just needed to write it out. </p>

I had seen this subreddit after our 5w miscarriage in 2015, when we struggled for almost a year to get pregnant again. At the time, I wasn't sure that this sub was the type of support I needed so I checked out other avenues of support instead. I could really use some support from you guys now. This is long because I just need to vent.

After getting pregnant again and passing all the ""risk milestones,"" we felt like this was the one. Sadly, our daughter Violet passed away and was born on Thanksgiving day, at 20 weeks.

My husband and I are struggling to keep it together. We support each other and have a great network of friends and loved ones, but it is so hard. We agreed that we would wait 6 months before revisiting the idea of trying a third time. Docs are doing genetic testing to give us a better idea of what went wrong and how likely it is to happen again.

Sometimes I want nothing more than to get pregnant again, thinking it was just bad luck. But part of me is so afraid to try again. I keep feeling like we are the cliched good people that bad things happen to. I'm  irrationally angry at extended family who ""pray for us"" or say it's part of God's plan for us. How could you put your faith and support in a God who could kill my daughter and torture us like this? Not trying to bash anyone's faith, just venting. I find myself angry at a God I don't believe in.

I just need to hear it's going to get better. Or commiseration that it sucks and it isn't fair. I am stuck between longing for a baby and feeling terrified at getting pregnant again. 

Docs started me on Zoloft for PPD and anxiety, but not long after starting it, I got a huge rash all over my chest. They couldn't tell if it was from the medicine or Violet's cremation necklace, because they were the only two new things and I got them at the same time. So I had to not wear her necklace for almost two weeks while they sorted it out, which shattered me (it was the Zoloft in the end and they switched me to Lexipro).

Apparently the septum was as wide as a thumb, so instead of doing the original resection, they just removed it. The procedure itself was pretty no fuss. I bled a lot the first day, but it looked like a larger amount due to the saline. I passed some brown tissue paper looking stuff, which my OB says is a medicine they put inside to stop bleeding. (If anyone knows what it's called let me know.) I had some cramping for about 24 hours, some fogginess due to the anaesthesia for about 2 days, then felt fine. 

Today I got the all clear to start trying again as soon as I get my period. Not sure when that will be as it was due the week after the procedure. It took 6 weeks after my D&C. I will have extra blood tests and ultrasounds to monitor  (before the procedure they talked about twice a month). That is reassuring to me as it lowers the chance of missing another miscarriage if it does happen. I will also have a special ultrasound in the 2nd trimester with a MFM specialist due to being on some new psychiatric meds (Lamictal and Lexapro). 

I am excited and nervous!",[],False,,0,False,Post septum removal appointment,[],r/ttcafterloss,False,0,,0,,,False,t3_5l41jc,False,dark,0.85,,public,8,0,{},,,False,,False,False,,{},,False,8,,self,False,,{},,True,,1483141616.0,text,0,,,self.ttcafterloss,False,"<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=""md""><p>Sorry to be posting twice in one day but I just got out of my ob appointment to follow up after my hysteroscopic septum removal on 12/9. </p>

But the more I think about it, the saltier I get. I was supposed to have the next grandchild. Now they will. And if I do get pregnant again when we get the ok to start trying (I just had a septum removal procedure), our baby would be less exciting because theirs will have just been born. 

I feel like this is ridiculous and petty but it does bother me. I mean, my husband is an only child so our child will be the only grandchild for his parents, but I want *my* family to feel as excited about it.
