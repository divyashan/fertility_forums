I've been lurking since our loss, but finally feel in a place that I could write this. I do want to preface this with a few trigger warnings: we do have a son (20 months old), and a friend's pregnancy is mentioned as well. My mom's multiple losses are also mentioned.

Its been a month since the 8-week ultrasound that showed us the baby hadn't developed. I'd had some spotting in the days before, but as I kept telling myself, brown blood meant old, and I'd had red spotting with our son and everything had gone okay with him. The ultrasound showed differently though, and I started bleeding in earnest that night. I was a mess that weekend, only getting out of bed to go to the bathroom. 

I thought I had come to terms with everything, and had started thinking about trying again for baby #2 in my next cycle. Then, at dinner with some friends on Friday, one couple announced they were expecting (twins, I found out later) and were due the same time I would have been due. I ran for the bathroom and completely lost it. If our pregnancy had progressed, we would have been announcing as well. To hear the due date was almost too much.

My husband and I left dinner early, our date night out instead spent in our car with me bawling about how empty I feel and the thought of going through a loss again might break me. 

I truly am happy for our friends, but I'm also heartbroken at what could have been, knowing that we'll see their kids grow up without our child beside them. 

How can I get past this? How will I know that trying again in the future won't shatter me? I keep wavering with the idea of trying again, knowing that I do want a second, but afraid to go through a loss again. 

This makes me feel weak, knowing my mom was pregnant 6 times, with only three surviving. She had one miscarriage, but two of my brothers died shortly after birth from genetic issues. My dad has told me before how strong my mom is for continuing to try. How can I not feel weak in possibly not trying again with what she went through?

And this is longer than I planned, but I needed to get it out to people who might understand what I'm going through. My husband is so supportive, but its not his body going through the physical loss.

I think all of it could apply to the loss experienced in this sub, and thought maybe it would help some folks here. Here is the comment from /u/gsnow: 

""I'm old. What that means is that I've survived (so far) and a lot of people I've known and loved did not. 

I've lost friends, best friends, acquaintances, co-workers, grandparents, mom, relatives, teachers, mentors, students, neighbors, and a host of other folks. I have no children, and I can't imagine the pain it must be to lose a child. But here's my two cents...

I wish I could say you get used to people dying. But I never did. I don't want to. It tears a hole through me whenever somebody I love dies, no matter the circumstances. But I don't want it to ""not matter"". I don't want it to be something that just passes. My scars are a testament to the love and the relationship that I had for and with that person. And if the scar is deep, so was the love. So be it. 

Scars are a testament to life. Scars are a testament that I can love deeply and live deeply and be cut, or even gouged, and that I can heal and continue to live and continue to love. And the scar tissue is stronger than the original flesh ever was. Scars are a testament to life. Scars are only ugly to people who can't see.

As for grief, you'll find it comes in waves. When the ship is first wrecked, you're drowning, with wreckage all around you. Everything floating around you reminds you of the beauty and the magnificence of the ship that was, and is no more. And all you can do is float. You find some piece of the wreckage and you hang on for a while. Maybe it's some physical thing. Maybe it's a happy memory or a photograph. Maybe it's a person who is also floating. For a while, all you can do is float. Stay alive.

In the beginning, the waves are 100 feet tall and crash over you without mercy. They come 10 seconds apart and don't even give you time to catch your breath. All you can do is hang on and float. After a while, maybe weeks, maybe months, you'll find the waves are still 100 feet tall, but they come further apart. When they come, they still crash all over you and wipe you out. But in between, you can breathe, you can function. You never know what's going to trigger the grief. It might be a song, a picture, a street intersection, the smell of a cup of coffee. It can be just about anything...and the wave comes crashing. But in between waves, there is life.

Somewhere down the line, and it's different for everybody, you find that the waves are only 80 feet tall. Or 50 feet tall. And while they still come, they come further apart. You can see them coming. An anniversary, a birthday, or Christmas, or landing at O'Hare. You can see it coming, for the most part, and prepare yourself. And when it washes over you, you know that somehow you will, again, come out the other side. Soaking wet, sputtering, still hanging on to some tiny piece of the wreckage, but you'll come out.

Take it from an old guy. The waves never stop coming, and somehow you don't really want them to. But you learn that you'll survive them. And other waves will come. And you'll survive them too.

I finally got my period today after a 38 day cycle. I am normally a VERY regular person, with strict 28-29 day cycles, and with very regular symptoms (cramping before period day, constipation, bloating, and increased hunger). This cycle was seriously messed up, not least of all due to being 10 days later than usual. As a bit of important background, I had a miscarriage at 9 weeks back in September, and so am also familiar with the symptoms of early pregnancy.
This cycle, I never got my normal pre-period cramps, but did feel almost prickly pains deep in my ovaries/uterus area from CD 27-32ish. I also felt like my breasts were more tender than usual. However, I got BFN after BFN all through testing (which I did up through CD 36). Not even a squinter.
Today, I finally got my period, accompanied by cramps. However, my flow isn't normal. This looks like fresh blood, with very few clots. I did a bit of research and while this doesn't seem to be cause for alarm, I'm wondering if all of these occurrences could have possibly been a chemical pregnancy? I'm really just trying to make sense of what happened, but I'm not sure how possible that is. Any insight is appreciated.

I'm new to Reddit and to this community, my sister is a long time member and suggested I join given my current circumstance. She had wonderful things to say about the community, and I figured I could use the support. (I hope I'm in the right place!)

I should start at the beginning. I'm 28 (not that it matters) and in a very loving long-term relationship (not that it matters). I have an L4/5 herniated disc that started off manageable, but over the last month has become unbearable. I am no longer able to sit upright without pain and numbness, which has left me out of work for the past few weeks. My left leg is becoming increasingly numb and I'm losing function in my left foot. Over the past month the doctors have tried everything from narcotics, to epidural steroid injections, to ease the pain. With no results and a second MRI showing an incredibly significant increase in the protrusion of the disc, we decided surgery was the only option. 

Flash forward to this Tuesday. I'm sitting in the pre-op holding area, the doctors are scrubbed and ready to go. There seems to be a bit of a delay and we're all not really sure what's going on. At one point the doctors ask everyone (my parents and my boyfriend who were with me) to leave the room. They tell me that my pre-operative pregnancy test (s) came back positive. They took a blood test just to be sure. 

I've been on the pill for several years and am in (relatively) good health. Our first reaction was, of course, shock-followed by a brief moment of excitement. My mom even said she was thrilled until she realized that this pregnancy will likely not be viable. They let me know that as of now, I'm right around the six week mark. They refused to move forward with the operation as it can put the baby at risk.  

Basically the doctors said that all the procedures I've had done, in addition to the cocktails of medications I've had over the past month, that the baby would likely not be viable. We met with my obgyn the next day and she had a similar response. Additionally, even if the baby was healthy, I would likely not be able to carry it for 9 months due to the severity of pain that I'm already in. I would be risking permanent nerve damage if I decided to continue. 

We were advised (by multiple doctors) to terminate the pregnancy. We are heartbroken. The procedure is scheduled for Monday and honestly I can't really put into words how bad this hurts. Both my boyfriend and I are just torn apart. At times I think he's taking it harder than I am, which is comforting in some kinda weird way. 

I guess I'm just reaching out for support. Our friends and family are incredibly supportive, but it is difficult at times as I know they have no idea how bad this hurts. The past few days have been up and down, with more downs than ups. I anticipate the days in the near future will be similar. 

If anyone has any advice as to how to manage this, I'm open to suggestions. I realize every situation is different, but being stuck at home (not working) without any distraction is enough to drive anyone crazy. 

If nothing else, thank you in advance for listening. It kind of feels good to write it all down.

For the past few months I was tracking ovulation and having timed intercourse but no fertility treatments.

This cycle I did Letrozol, Ovidrel, and timed intercourse. It is now CD24.  My cycles for the past few months have been 24-28 days long.  But I've had so many CPs that I don't even like to take a HPT until I'm really late.

I could take one now and if it's positive I may just end up getting my period in a few days. But if it is negative I won't know if it is a real negative or if it is just too early.  

And of course getting pregnant can feel a lot like getting your period, so every time I feel a tiny twinge of a cramp I don't know what it means.  With the pregnancy that I lost six months ago I felt like I was getting my period for a week before I got a positive pregnancy test around CD30.

I want to feel certain about something, anything.  I just want to get through the next few days so that I can feel better about test results, no matter what they say.  The waiting and the uncertainty feels even worse than a negative test.

<p>This cycle I did Letrozol, Ovidrel, and timed intercourse. It is now CD24.  My cycles for the past few months have been 24-28 days long.  But I&#39;ve had so many CPs that I don&#39;t even like to take a HPT until I&#39;m really late.</p>

<p>And of course getting pregnant can feel a lot like getting your period, so every time I feel a tiny twinge of a cramp I don&#39;t know what it means.  With the pregnancy that I lost six months ago I felt like I was getting my period for a week before I got a positive pregnancy test around CD30.</p>

<p>I want to feel certain about something, anything.  I just want to get through the next few days so that I can feel better about test results, no matter what they say.  The waiting and the uncertainty feels even worse than a negative test.</p>

Went for my second ultrasound today at 8w+2. No growth since the 6w+4 scan (where I measured 6w+1 with a 99bpm heartbeat) and no heartbeat.

We were both feeling so positive, my early hcg results were good, we saw an early heartbeat, I was feeling really nauseous. I hate that my body again told me all was well for nearly 2 weeks between scans.

This makes our third loss, since we had a CP before the first MMC. That one was discovered at the 7w scan and measured 5w+2.

Feeling shocked, devastated, numb. Called off work, as did DH. Don't really know what the fuck I'm supposed to do with myself now. How am I going to go on about life? I just found out another baby died inside of me.

There goes another timeline. It took 7 months to get pregnant again. We were following a healthy diet, I haven't touched caffeine or alcohol in months. We did preseed, we did mucinex, we did fertilaid, I did myo-inositol. I had an hsg this cycle and it seemed to help us get pregnant. But why can't I stay pregnant? Will we be able to figure out if this is a solvable problem? Will I ever have a healthy pregnancy? 

I found out in the past months that I have PCOS, so I feel like maybe I have bum eggs. But I don't have insulin resistance so the RE didn't want to do metformin. She offered to do clomid, we hadn't tried that yet.

<p>Went for my second ultrasound today at 8w+2. No growth since the 6w+4 scan (where I measured 6w+1 with a 99bpm heartbeat) and no heartbeat.</p>

<p>We were both feeling so positive, my early hcg results were good, we saw an early heartbeat, I was feeling really nauseous. I hate that my body again told me all was well for nearly 2 weeks between scans.</p>

<p>This makes our third loss, since we had a CP before the first MMC. That one was discovered at the 7w scan and measured 5w+2.</p>

<p>Feeling shocked, devastated, numb. Called off work, as did DH. Don&#39;t really know what the fuck I&#39;m supposed to do with myself now. How am I going to go on about life? I just found out another baby died inside of me.</p>

<p>There goes another timeline. It took 7 months to get pregnant again. We were following a healthy diet, I haven&#39;t touched caffeine or alcohol in months. We did preseed, we did mucinex, we did fertilaid, I did myo-inositol. I had an hsg this cycle and it seemed to help us get pregnant. But why can&#39;t I stay pregnant? Will we be able to figure out if this is a solvable problem? Will I ever have a healthy pregnancy? </p>

<p>I found out in the past months that I have PCOS, so I feel like maybe I have bum eggs. But I don&#39;t have insulin resistance so the RE didn&#39;t want to do metformin. She offered to do clomid, we hadn&#39;t tried that yet.</p>

I took the pill on Friday and expected it to work (maybe be painful), but to work. I passed on large clot and that was it. No cramps, no heavy bleeding, nothing. I was panicking that now I'm going to have to also have a D%C (which I still might). I was having a pain where I could feel the baby before. The bleeding had started to just be brown old blood.  

Yesterday evening my family and I went bowling. I had a little red blood start this afternoon and luckily packed one of my huge pads (that I swear might be larger than my corgi) in my purse. I had thrown a few balls, and suddenly felt a rush. I ran to the bathroom...and finally something was happening! I've never really gotten stomach cramps, they happen more in my legs. I could feel some, but not too bad. Went out, rolled a couple more balls....passed more. This happened a few times. I feel like I should have gone home, but I wasn't in pain and it was working so well. Plus my house was 25 minutes away. Eventually I did go to my parents house that was 3 minutes away.

I am sorry if this is not the place but i hear about this subreddit and the support it brings a lot and I think I just need to write my story somewhere. I am not even sure how ready I am to accept this but it happened so I have no choice.
I lost my baby today (11 weeks 5 days was the estimate) this would have been # 2 for us. all i keep saying is this is just not happening, i read about this how is it happening to me? Aug I know i am not invincible to this but gosh darn it the doc told me we were doing great just days ago and that heartbeat was strong. We were given the okay to share the news and less than 2% chance of miscarriage is what we were told, now we get to tell everyone this days later. I feel like a fraud who never had a right to say she was pregnant, I feel empty and like it is all my fault since my baby was alive and well just days ago.

Sorry this maybe long and way tmi:
Had appointment with doc and had a pap smear done on that visit (Monday). Was told to expect light bleeding, bleeding started very very light tuesday night.

I sit back down to see what is happening and feel something slide out, look in the bowl and it is my baby no doubt. Woke husband and called OB, i am told expect heavy bleeding for 2 hrs then if continues for 4 then callback. It continues filling pad, gushes of blood now, just all insane. I call and am told to go to the ER, at the ER the remove more stuff that was stuck and after hours bleeding slows, also had ultrasound.
I was at ER alone since we have nobody to watch our 19 mth old and hubby had to stay with him.

I've started taking the Metformin 2x/day just a few days ago, as that was something my GP suggested several months ago if 1x/day didn't help.

At my check up for POC, I told the nurse that I'd been feeling light headed, dizzy, and faint whenever I was even slightly physically active.  I was feeling a little stronger every day but I wanted to know when I was going to feel better.  The nurse prescribed ferromax (an iron supplement) and Preg-Vit prenatal vitamins and I've been taking them for a week now (it took me a little while to go to the pharmacy).  It was recommended that I wait at least two cycles to start trying again.

Since I have to wait anyway and my cycles are long, I thought I might get back into weight lifting since I used to be pretty fit that way, but the anemia makes even basic household chores exhausting.  I had to take a two hour nap yesterday because we went grocery shopping at the farmers market and grocery store.  I didn't think that walking around and carrying the lighter grocery bags was going to affect me as much as it did.  As for carrying three bags of groceries up three flights of stairs, yeah, I probably shouldn't have done that since the stairs are bad enough as it is.  Currently, I can walk about 1-1.5km at a leisurely pace on flat ground which is a big improvement from getting lightheaded just from standing up (it was that bad a few days after the MC).  I do feel a bit stronger every day, but sometimes I overdo it by thinking I'm back at 100%.

Question 1: I'm eating lots of broccoli, spinach, chicken breast and salmon while taking the iron supplement & prenatal vitamin.  What else can I do to recover?

Question 2: How long should I wait/how can I tell when it's okay to start lifting weights (I'll start with no weights and work up to 5lb just to start with)?

<p>I only measured 6w6d along and there was never a fetal pole. Just a gestational sac. Do you think there is anyway that the medicine worked? I&#39;ve heard the sac tends to be gray, and I had nothing like that...just one large clot. Do you think there could be more still to come? I&#39;ve finished all my pills. </p>

<p>My ultrasound is Wednesday, but I was just curious if anyone had an experiences or thoughts on this. I really don&#39;t want to have to do a D&amp;C as well. </p>

Instead it will be a reminder that it is unhappy news I am bringing in my baggage. Just pile it all in, my arms have gotten a little bit stronger. 

I know I need to communicate with my husband better, but he just gets angry that I am mean and he says it's not his fault. I GET that, thanks! My sadness, anger, and broken heart can not be cured overnight. Sorry, but today I don't want to put on a happy face. The day after I found out I lost our baby I would like to hide my face in the dark basement, read stories on how to get through, and be sad. I don't want to forget about the dreams I have for our lost child and I want to pretend that maybe they can still be there. 

There is a friend driving through town and I was hoping that after he saw me yesterday and we exchanged words on how I needed my time, he would have his friend and her RV stay elsewhere.

Before we were engaged, about a year and a half ago, we lost our baby at almost 9 weeks. We were really excited, so it was incredibly devastating for both of us.

Fast forward to today, I'm sort of having those feelings of excitement/thinking I'm crazy/wanting to ignore my body.

The first time, I could *feel* I was pregnant. I tested pretty much every day to watch the line get darker and darker... well, until the day it got lighter. I was so excited and every twinge and cramp and backache just made me more excited. Today, I am either 5 or 8 dpo. I'm not sure. I think I may have been late because of honeymoon travel. I don't know when to buy tests. I don't know when to take that first test. I feel like I both don't want to and I can't wait to. My cervix feels the way it did the first time, I'm mildly cramping off and on like I did the first time, my boobs are starting to hurt like they did the first time, and it just makes me feel like I'm probably a crazy person with a bad case of wishful thinking. I can't experience the wonder and excitement like I did the first time. I was waiting for growth the first time, and now I just feel like I'm waiting for the other shoe to drop. I'm waiting for another loss, or just waiting for my cycle to start again and reinforce my thought that yes, I am a crazy person getting my hopes up somewhere in there for no reason.",t2_lj4sj,False,,0,False,"Intro post (may be triggering, but no extreme details)",[],r/ttcafterloss,False,0,intro,0,,,False,t3_4qsxjm,False,dark,0.81,,public,6,0,{},,,False,[],,False,False,,{},Intro,False,6,,False,self,False,,[],{},,True,,1467422901.0,text,0,,,text,self.ttcafterloss,False,"<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=""md""><p>Hi there, I&#39;m a newlywed, husband and I are both 30-ish, no kids.

89,2048,confidence,<praw.reddit.Reddit object at 0x7f12a630cd90>,,ttcafterloss,"I just had my first MC yesterday my baby was born still alive but was just under 15 weeks so there was nothing the doctors could do it only squirmed for a minute maybe two but as it was still attached to me and just sitting next to my leg so I could feel it until it went still. That's the basics of yesterday and here is a bit of background.

This was my second pregnancy the first being a set of twins who are now 3 and a half. I had to deliver via emergency c section for them and the resulting scar had troubles later with it healing. 

I found out at the NT ultrasound that this baby had attached directly to said surgical scar. And while I will likely never no for sure the reasons I feel that given that the baby was alive that it just couldn't stay attached in that place. 

I will say that my hospital trip though do to events was traumatic was over all a positive one. The doctors and nurses in the er were there for me even if just to hold my hand so I wasn't dealing alone. I am married but we don't have much by way of help so he was spending the day trying to keep the twins calm and cared for and we were exchanging phone calls when I could actually have them. It's been hard on him for not being able to be there but we both know that trying to put two toddlers through seeing me in labor and pain and screaming for 10 hours would both have been wrong and frankly impossible to do. 

After the labor was complete and I was given the ok to go home, I asked for the body for burial. We are muslim and it needs to be done as quickly as possible as there is no kind of preserving you want the body laid to rest before decay sets in and out of simple respect too. The actual rulings on miscarriage are rather complicated, for us the baby receives a soul at the night it turns 16 weeks. Before that it is just a vessel. If it was far enough along to be human in feature (roughly the 11-12 week mark) then a burial must occur but without the normal funeral processes of washing, prayer, and blessing. 
So it fell to my husband and I to after connected to the cemetery to do the funeral service for lack of a better word by ourselves as well. 

We did this today with many great difficulties. When I went to the hospital they gave me the body but told me they wouldn't be determining the gender, and while pathology would have a report it was unlikely it would include gender either, also that this said report would take roughly 6 weeks to be filed with records where I could go and purchase a copy of at said time. 

So when I needed to know the gender for the burial I did my best, the hospital had given me the body in a plastic tub so I took my baby out to lay it's little body to rest in a casket made for a true newborn. I looked and looked but I'm no doctor even with Google I can't really say for certain and that hurts. I wanted a girl and a part of me tells me it must have been but the other part needs a full truth so I know I gave my baby a proper name not naming a son after a daughter just because I had wanted one. 

I was given a little pillow by the nurses the first night a sort of remembrance gift which I put in the casket to set its little head on and wrapped it with a small white cloth. My husband said some prayers and what he could. There's a saying that Islamically the greatest thing a parent can give to thier child is a good name. And I just feel cheated by not knowing. My husband and is have picked two names one for a boy one for a girl and we will wait for the pathology report before adding a plate to the burial site. If the report says a gender we will use the correct name if it does not we will use the girls name because I kept feeling and hoping it was a girl before all this happened. There aren't really gender neutral names we can use at least not with a meaning that is right for this child.

They left the placenta in the container and because I didn't have any idea what was proper to do with that we took it back to the hospital. They had me take it up to the labor and delivery department and when I told the attending nurse that if I needed to wait for her to make sure the baby wasn't in the container she told me it was fine because she didnt hear any crying. All while I still had blood clinging to my fingernails. I don't blame her she didn't know any details was just trying to be light hearted but already being up where the healthy live babies were after literally just coming from the cemetery, it hurt so much I couldn't even speak. 

Right now I'm home trying to adjust and figure out how to make it. My twins keep talking about the baby, and saying things that make it so hard to breathe. At dinner one asked if the baby was going to be ok with it getting dark outside. And the other keeps asking if I need to go back to the  doctor. I know with time I will be ok I'm not ever going to forget nor should I but eventually I won't break down looking out at the trees in the wind or maybe it won't hurt quite so much to think that even while I love and hold the living children I have the one I don't I only got to hold the once and when it was just a empty vessel.

We talked a lot via text in the week leading up to her D&amp;E. I sent her a necklace and talked about visiting at some point and probably bringing food. I remember how important visitors and the chance to talk were for me after Ethan died.

That said...I'm having a rougher week than I anticipated. Honestly - I don't think I have it in me to focus for a while today, or before my next checkup on Friday, on someone's loss when I'm nervous about this pregnancy. I should also point out, for those who didn't see me post about this in r/infertility, that this teammate spent a lot of time dumping on me in the weeks before her loss when I was going through my FET and that it caused me a lot of stress. She's not particularly tactful or good about thinking about others before herself. She's fully allowed to be selfish right now...but there has been zero mention in any of our conversations about how I'm holding up. I obviously have not told her the result of my FET. 

This co-worker literally texted last night asking him if I planned to come visit soon. Honestly...I want to tell her no, but I haven't responded because I don't want to hurt her feelings. 

I'm thinking of running to the store and making a lasagna today and asking if I can do a quick drop off rather than a long visit.

104,2048,confidence,<praw.reddit.Reddit object at 0x7f12a630cd90>,,ttcafterloss,"Hi everyone. I've lurked here sporadically in the past, haven't really been trying to conceive since my last miscarriage, but my husband and I are ready to try again, so I thought I would write an introductory post. I feel like this community could really help me in the coming months.  

Last April, my period ended up being over a week late, which for me is unheard of. My husband and I hadn't been trying to conceive, but we hadn't been not trying, either. I got really excited and then my period showed up before I could see a doctor. I'll never know for sure if I was pregnant, but I feel like I know my body, and for me, I count that as a (very early) miscarriage.

I was surprised at my reaction to the possible pregnancy, and told my husband I wanted to conceive soon. He was reluctant, but had a change of heart a couple of months later. We started trying to conceive in earnest that June, and it only took me two cycles to get pregnant. 

I was through the roof with happiness when the at home pregnancy test was positive. I went to the doctor very soon afterward, and she ordered the hCG testing. My first test indicated what my doctor found to be low levels. She told me she was concerned and I cancelled a big trip I had plan (no regrets, of course). I kept getting my hCG levels tested, and they started to climb. The doctor was optimistic after this, and I was excited again. We told my mother, my husband's parents, and my sister-in-law, as well as a few close friends, but other than that, we were keeping it under wraps. I was a bit stressed out due to work and school, as was my husband, but was cutting back on caffeine, eating really well, and feeling, overall, confident. 

I also had intermittent spotting during my pregnancy, which the doctor dismissed after my hCG levels started climbing regularly. Just over nine weeks in, the spotting was becoming more consistent. I was monitoring it but not too concerned (it was pretty light). One Saturday morning in September, though, after about 48 hours of consistent bleeding, I decided to check it out. My husband and I went to the ER, as the early pregnancy assessment unit in our city wouldn't see us (they don't see new patients on the weekend). We ended up spending about seven hours in the ER, only getting in after about five to seven hours of wait. I could just tell that the triage nurses didn't consider me a priority. I took it as calmly as I could at the time, though now it really irks me. 

We got in and got an ultrasound. We were still worried, but in a way excited, since we hadn't had an ultrasound yet. Part of me really thought everything was going to be okay and we would be sent home after getting to see the fetus. But the doctors saw nothing. My hCG levels were still elevated and my bleeding was still very light, so they told me a miscarriage had either just started or was imminent. Sure enough, when I went to the washroom to clean myself up after the ultrasound, I found the bleeding had increased dramatically. 

We went home and the miscarriage started in earnest -- first I had a gassy feeling, then cramps, then full-blown contractions. The ER doctor had told me to take acetaminophen for the pain, which obviously provided no relief. I called my sister-in-law, who's a doctor, and she told me I could take a large dose of ibuprofen. Even that didn't help, though. I was in agony that evening and into the night, could barely sleep. 

Shortly after the miscarriage, I saw a slew of doctors. To make a long story short, all of them told me that because I'm healthy, young (I was 29 at the time), and clearly don't have trouble conceiving, I should have no problem getting pregnant next time. 

Despite this, I am of course concerned. Not so much about my ability to get pregnant (though that does worry me, especially because my husband decided he wanted to put off trying again for almost a year), but mostly because of the lack of care available for women who have had miscarriages. I'm worried about being able to carry a pregnancy to term, and I was informed back in September/October, when I saw all those doctors, that genetic counselling and tests are only made available in our province to couples who have had three or more *confirmed* miscarriages. That means that I count right now as having had just one miscarriage, and have to have at least two more *confirmed* miscarriages before I get any help. It's an awful feeling, I have to say.

My other concerns are more about my psychological health. I ended up making a Facebook post about my miscarriage back in October because I was tired of not talking about it. It was helpful in some ways, but in others it just made things harder. And overall, I still feel like I haven't had a lot of support from our family and friends, which has made me somewhat bitter. 

I always make an effort to try to be happy for others, but it's been hardly lately, specifically with young parents. The amount of BS I've heard from people as well really gets to me, even though I know I should ignore it (things like ""Well maybe it just wasn't meant to be"" and ""Don't be sad"").

Also, sorry it's so long but it feels good to tell the story of our baby. 
Our story:  
We had been trying off and on for about a year and a half, not really trying hard but letting nature take its course. I was on the fence but open to having children and my husband wanted children badly. So we tried, and December it didn't look like it was going to happen so we got another dog, then I found out I was pregnant on Valentine's day. We were so excited. As soon as I was pregnant it felt right. The first trimester went by with a little hiccup, I ended up in the hospital with a small subchorionic hematoma, but the doc wasn't worried as it was small. We cancelled our trip to the Caribbean due to Zika. I'm a worrier so I didn't want to tell anyone until we passed the 12 week mark. It went by but I was still worried so we waited to tell friends. Then I was 20 weeks and told myself I need to stop worrying and enjoy my little bump that was developing, and enjoy the little kicks that I was beginning to feel. My world was filled with sunshine and rainbows when we found out we were having a boy. Before we knew the gender we picked the name Mackenzie. Two days after we posted on Facebook that we were expecting I got a call from my OB letting me know that there was a concern with my cervix and she wanted to send me to a specialist in a larger city. I had my appointment within the next two days and they confirmed that my cervix was short and funneling and there was some membrane sticking out, which made me a bad candidate for cerclage so they recommended that I go home and rest and see how everything played out. Well my follow-up was 2 weeks later and I was now 5cm dilated but the membrane was still in tact. They ended up admitting me to the hospital on my 22nd week. I stayed in for 3 days being fully dilated they did a check up on baby Mack and they couldn't find the heartbeat. My heart broke right then. I felt like Every time I had any kind of hope reality came to kick me in the teeth. So I gave birth to a beautiful baby boy, he weighed only 16 ounces and came out breach. He had the cutest nose that was both mine and my husband's. 

We got to spend the night with him and hold him and kiss him. We were even lucky enough to get little foot prints. Both of our families were there to say hello and goodbye. The next day was the hardest, I didn't want to leave him alone and I didn't want to say goodbye. He was beautiful. It's a weird feeling but we had him cremated and it made me happy to have him in our house again.  
   
I know I'm so lucky to have carried him as long as I did but I can't help but feel like my body failed me.  
I want to try again, so badly, but I'm terrified of my body failing me again. After the loss I don't know where to go from here. I never realized how much I wanted a baby until baby Mack came into our lives.  

How do you ladies start trying again, there was no follow up scheduled for me, I'm not sure whether I call the high risk dr to talk about trying again or to the ob who I was briefly a patient of. I know I still need some time to heal, physically and emotionally, but I want to plan to try again.",t2_eftby,False,,0,False,"Intro, super long, loss at 22+2",[],r/ttcafterloss,False,0,intro,0,,,False,t3_4q13kp,False,dark,0.95,,public,14,0,{},,,False,[],,False,False,,{},Intro,False,14,,False,self,False,,[],{},,True,,1467023823.0,text,0,,,text,self.ttcafterloss,False,"<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=""md""><p>Hi everyone, I honestly haven&#39;t been lurking much, I&#39;ve been trying to avoid everything to do with our loss but I&#39;m here and I need to deal with it.
