2,2048,confidence,<praw.reddit.Reddit object at 0x7f12a630cd90>,,ttcafterloss,"This is one sub that I always saw mentioned and never expected to join. My son Sterling was born a week ago on July 28.  We found out the evening before that he had died. I would have been 38 weeks pregnant on July 29.

He looked perfect, a fully formed baby ready to go home. We have no answers at this point. There was no obvious cause of death. I could feel him moving and then he just stopped. I went to the midwife, and she couldn't find a heartbeat, so we went to the hospital where they confirmed with an ultrasound that he was gone.

I was induced. The labour was easy and the birth uncomplicated. I have a 2 year old daughter, and I opted to not have an epidural for her birth, but this time I wanted to feel no more pain than necessary. He was born so easily. I didn't even have to push, I cried him out. I had no tearing, even though he was 6lbs 7oz. I barely even feel like I gave birth. At a time when most women are aggrieved over their postpartum bodies, I'm feeling physically fine. Light bleeding, swollen breasts, otherwise not a stretch mark or extra pound to prove to me that my pregnancy, my baby, was real. My body wants to forget.

Sterling's funeral was yesterday. We were surrounded by family and friends. The tiny casket was more upsetting than I expected. Barely bigger than a shoebox. We put my baby in the ground. We buried him on the same plot as my mother, who died 11 years ago. We went to visit him today, just me and my husband. And it was peaceful, but didn't help me feel more at peace.

I'm amazed at how my daughter can both fix and break my heart a million times a day. She was so ready for her baby brother. She kissed my belly and talked to her brother every day. She would tuck her dolls into Sterling's rocker and then lean over and kiss them and say ""I love you!"" It's been heartbreaking to see her try to take care of me every day. The first few days when I couldn't get out of bed and she would come to hug me, tell me to feel better, ask why I'm crying, why I'm sad. As I've tried to pull myself out of the consuming grief, I've tried to be there for her more. My mother in law has been staying with us this week and I'm so grateful. The other day my daughter brought me a flower she picked for me in the park after a walk with her grandmother. She ran up the stairs to give it to me, to try to make me smile. ""You like it, mama?"" she kept asking. I felt genuinely happy for the first time. I told her I loved it, and I loved her.

Talking to toddlers about death while you're grieving is impossible. I've repeated so many times ""baby brother died, baby brother died"" because you can't be ambiguous with a toddler. My heart cracks a bit more each time. Tonight she was confused about birth. She kept saying that she lived in my belly, she was born, she died. I had to keep telling her she was born and she lived. It was different for her, babies don't usually die. I don't know when she'll really understand.

I've been surrounded by love. Friends and family have overwhelmingly shown up for us. Family took over funeral planning, friends all chipped in to help us with expenses or for whatever we need for the next while. My husband has been my protector, my rock. I have never felt closer to him, though we both feel destroyed and lost. I know we are so lucky in most ways, and very unlucky in this one specific way.

I don't know how I go on with my life. After I had my daughter I left a good career in advertising to become a doula and birth photographer. I was just getting that business started when I became pregnant, and then issues in the pregnancy made it impossible for me to continue working. How do I go back to that life? I don't know if I can. I don't know how I go back to any sense of normalcy when my son has died before I even met him.

My husband and I both think we'll want another baby. I'm consumed with anxiety about how I would survive a pregnancy after getting through 38 weeks of this one only to have my son die. But at the same time I want to be pregnant again, right now. I don't want to erase or replace Sterling. But I made so much room in my heart to love a living, breathing baby, and it's stifling to have that love go to a baby who never lived outside my body.

4,2048,confidence,<praw.reddit.Reddit object at 0x7f12a630cd90>,,ttcafterloss,"Hi all,

I wanted to explain my situation and ask for your thoughts on TTC.

This was my first pregnancy. We were lucky to get pregnant the first month of trying, but not lucky in that at my 9 week US on July 12 the little embryo was only 6 weeks (4 mm fetal pole but no Hb). Fast forward 2 weeks after confirmation hcg and ultrasounds and I elected to and had a d&c done on July 23. I've had some spotting, lots of watery fluid, and a bit of bleeding the past few days but no pain really.

My hcg was 23,000 a week before the d&c and then fell to 17,000, then to 13,000 3 days before the d&c. I just had my hcg tested Aug 3 ( 1 week 4 days after the d&c) and I was so happy to see it was only at 68.

My cycles before were 28 days and consistent previously. I am hoping I will get my period before the end of August. (D&C was July 23).

I have a follow up on August 8 and then we should be clear to have sex again. I will also ask about TTC but what my family maternity doc told me she thinks waiting for one cycle would be good but that it's really just for dating purposes. I will get another opinion at my follow up. I have also heard there is no scientific evidence of needing to wait after a non complicated and early mmc + d&c. I am young (27) and healthy.

I am just wondering the group's thoughts on whether we should actually prevent pregnancy until I get my first period. DH will be on a trip during my likely fertile time in September assuming my period comes late august. So I don't want to wait but also don't want to jeopardize things by being impatient.

7,2048,confidence,<praw.reddit.Reddit object at 0x7f12a630cd90>,,ttcafterloss,"TW: infant loss. Also long and mention of living child. 

My son Linden Jonathan passed away July 20th, at 28 weeks exactly. He was delivered via  emergency c-section and lived about a minute. I wasn't able to witness his short life as I was put under for the procedure. I remember knowing as I went under though that I'd never hear my boy cry, or see his smile or open eyes, but I hoped his presence and passing would be peaceful. 

I've talked about Linden a bit on the October bumpers group. To make a long story short he was diagnosed with a rare and severe congenital heart defect after his anatomy ultrasound, and his prognosis was never great. Basically he had a 30% chance of making it to term without going into heart failure, and to make the various surgeries he would need to live feasible he would have to be born as close to full term as possible. For any curious, and in case someone in the future is looking for info as there isn't much concerning his particular CHD, Linden suffered from a severe case of Ebsteins Anomaly of the tricuspid valve. My husband and I were told we could terminate, but ultimately it wasn't something I felt comfortable doing. I wanted my son to have whatever chance he could. 

After 2 months of non stop appointments, genetic testing, and ultrasounds I finally had a respite of a week of nothing. His movements always fluctuated but I noticed Thursday that week I had only felt a couple kicks. Friday I didn't feel anything so that morning after my husband went to work I packed up my son and went to the hospital for an nst. I was so relieved when the nurse found his heartbeat. After 40 minutes though the nst was still basically one flat line, no variability to speak of. They started talking about an ultrasound. A few minutes later the first decel. I texted my husband and asked him to leave work. Then the decels started coming quick, and his heart rate dropped to 60, then 50, then 30. The ob asked if I wanted to have a c section or let him pass in utero. My eldest son was taken by some lovely nurses to play in an office, while I was rushed to surgery. I'm selfishly grateful he's young enough that he won't remember this. 

The nurses and doctors were incredibly supportive and understanding, and my husband was there shortly after I woke up. My eldest son was taken to the lake by his grandparents while we spent the weekend holding his brother. We got some beautiful photo's of Linden, who looked peaceful and was absolutely perfect. His hand and footprints seemed so big for him only being 28 weeks. We kept a lock of hair, which I look at now surprised by how much he had already. His chest was bruised from the efforts of the medical team, and I hope he wasn't hurt or scared before he passed. He lived a minute, but neither of his parents were witness to that. We got his ashes yesterday and finally brought him home. 

I feel a lot of guilt, wondering if I made the wrong choice. If I hadn't chosen that c section would he have passed or had a better chance? If I had gone in the day before would there have been more that could be done? Should I have not gone to the hospital at all, as the Dr's there had no knowledge of his CHD? Would his nst always have been so atypical?  Should I have advocated better for my little boy? 

Most days aren't bad, I get up and shower and make sure my eldest is clean, fed and occupied with his games and toys. But the days are still punctured by crying, it seems like everywhere there are women happily pregnant and the jealousy is painful. Its only been two weeks but everything feels like a betrayal to my little boy. When I'm not upset it feels wrong to be happy, like I'm not mourning him adequately. When I am upset it feels like I'm subtracting from all the love and joy he brought to my life. Moving forward feels wrong, dwelling on everything that went wrong feels even worse. I want my oldest to know he had a brother, but worry about introducing him to such a dark topic to young. Frankly, I don't know what to do. 

Going for a follow up appointment yesterday the receptionist congratulated me on the new baby, and I didn't know what to say. He was here for a moment, and now he's gone. I wish I could hold him just one more time. The urn his ashes are in is quite beautiful it least. I wish Linden's story was different, it is to short by far but I hope he knows what an impact he left.

<p>My son Linden Jonathan passed away July 20th, at 28 weeks exactly. He was delivered via  emergency c-section and lived about a minute. I wasn&#39;t able to witness his short life as I was put under for the procedure. I remember knowing as I went under though that I&#39;d never hear my boy cry, or see his smile or open eyes, but I hoped his presence and passing would be peaceful. </p>

<p>I&#39;ve talked about Linden a bit on the October bumpers group. To make a long story short he was diagnosed with a rare and severe congenital heart defect after his anatomy ultrasound, and his prognosis was never great. Basically he had a 30% chance of making it to term without going into heart failure, and to make the various surgeries he would need to live feasible he would have to be born as close to full term as possible. For any curious, and in case someone in the future is looking for info as there isn&#39;t much concerning his particular CHD, Linden suffered from a severe case of Ebsteins Anomaly of the tricuspid valve. My husband and I were told we could terminate, but ultimately it wasn&#39;t something I felt comfortable doing. I wanted my son to have whatever chance he could. </p>

<p>After 2 months of non stop appointments, genetic testing, and ultrasounds I finally had a respite of a week of nothing. His movements always fluctuated but I noticed Thursday that week I had only felt a couple kicks. Friday I didn&#39;t feel anything so that morning after my husband went to work I packed up my son and went to the hospital for an nst. I was so relieved when the nurse found his heartbeat. After 40 minutes though the nst was still basically one flat line, no variability to speak of. They started talking about an ultrasound. A few minutes later the first decel. I texted my husband and asked him to leave work. Then the decels started coming quick, and his heart rate dropped to 60, then 50, then 30. The ob asked if I wanted to have a c section or let him pass in utero. My eldest son was taken by some lovely nurses to play in an office, while I was rushed to surgery. I&#39;m selfishly grateful he&#39;s young enough that he won&#39;t remember this. </p>

<p>The nurses and doctors were incredibly supportive and understanding, and my husband was there shortly after I woke up. My eldest son was taken to the lake by his grandparents while we spent the weekend holding his brother. We got some beautiful photo&#39;s of Linden, who looked peaceful and was absolutely perfect. His hand and footprints seemed so big for him only being 28 weeks. We kept a lock of hair, which I look at now surprised by how much he had already. His chest was bruised from the efforts of the medical team, and I hope he wasn&#39;t hurt or scared before he passed. He lived a minute, but neither of his parents were witness to that. We got his ashes yesterday and finally brought him home. </p>

<p>I feel a lot of guilt, wondering if I made the wrong choice. If I hadn&#39;t chosen that c section would he have passed or had a better chance? If I had gone in the day before would there have been more that could be done? Should I have not gone to the hospital at all, as the Dr&#39;s there had no knowledge of his CHD? Would his nst always have been so atypical?  Should I have advocated better for my little boy? </p>

<p>Most days aren&#39;t bad, I get up and shower and make sure my eldest is clean, fed and occupied with his games and toys. But the days are still punctured by crying, it seems like everywhere there are women happily pregnant and the jealousy is painful. Its only been two weeks but everything feels like a betrayal to my little boy. When I&#39;m not upset it feels wrong to be happy, like I&#39;m not mourning him adequately. When I am upset it feels like I&#39;m subtracting from all the love and joy he brought to my life. Moving forward feels wrong, dwelling on everything that went wrong feels even worse. I want my oldest to know he had a brother, but worry about introducing him to such a dark topic to young. Frankly, I don&#39;t know what to do. </p>

<p>Going for a follow up appointment yesterday the receptionist congratulated me on the new baby, and I didn&#39;t know what to say. He was here for a moment, and now he&#39;s gone. I wish I could hold him just one more time. The urn his ashes are in is quite beautiful it least. I wish Linden&#39;s story was different, it is to short by far but I hope he knows what an impact he left. </p>

<p>I miss you and love you Linden, now and forever.</p>

I can’t help thinking she got her sonogram a month after I got mine and was supposed to listen the baby’s heart, my first kid.

* Removal of the Alumni Daily Thread

As many of you have seen, our Alumni were looking for a bigger space. The new sub r/PregnancyAfterLoss was created and was immediately a big hit. Almost all our Alumni quickly moved over here. While this may be hard for some who are still in TTC, it was overwhelmingly desired with our Alum. Due to this, we have removed our Alumni Daily Thread.

* Change of use to the Weekly Results Thread (starting next week)

The Weekly Results Thread was historically used for Positive/Negative results of pregnancy tests or to share results of fertility testing/etc.  

It was most often used for pregnancy announcements and then our users started posting in Alumni.

We still want to use it this way, but we also want to allow further talk about pregnancy in this thread. This is so that anyone who is in very early pregnancy and doesn't want to go to the PAL sub just yet may be able to get support here.  Also, anyone who may be in some type of ""pregnancy limbo"" can post here and not have to go to the PAL sub.

Today I should be 9+2. I went in to my first prenatal appointment on 8+6 with my hospital-based midwifery practice. They did a transvaginal ultrasound, and told me either my dates are entirely off or I’m at the beginning of a miscarriage. I just did two days of HCG blood testing (48 hrs apart) and have a follow up appointment for a better ultrasound on Tuesday with the high risk maternal fetal medicine clinic (better machines and u/s techs for dating/viability ultrasound).

44,2048,confidence,<praw.reddit.Reddit object at 0x7f12a630cd90>,,ttcafterloss,"Hi everyone. I delivered my son Albert last Tuesday at 32+2, we found out the previous Friday (20th July) that he had died and had likely been gone a few days.  On Monday 16th we had been in with the OB and had listened to his heartbeat, and while she was concerned that he was measuring a little small everything else seemed fine and I had a growth scan booked in for the Friday anyway, which was when I was told he had no heartbeat. This is technically my second pregnancy (first pregnancy was about ten years ago and terminated for non-medical reasons at 9/10 weeks), was a super easy low risk pregnancy, didn’t even really get morning sickness. No problems conceiving - we got married on December 16th last year and said that after the wedding we just wouldn’t try to prevent it, fell pregnant on our wedding night.

I went into hospital to be induced on Sunday with misoprostal tablets, went into labour Sunday afternoon/evening but for some reason labour just stopped around 11pm. Had two more doses of the misoprostal on Monday afternoon, felt absolutely nothing, got a bit of cramping around 11pm Monday night and was in active labour (again!) by midnight. The contractions were awful, I am a tough cookie and I was crying in pain from the contractions and given multiple doses of morphine plus gas to deal with it. I gave birth around 8am and honestly that was the easiest bit, but my son was so, so small - his birth weight was 840g when he should have been closer to about 1.5kg. He was delivered breech and my contractions basically stopped at that point so I just pushed him out under my own steam, only had one contraction right at the end when delivering his head. He was small but in proportion and didn’t outwardly look like there was anything majorly wrong with him.

Obviously I haven’t had any follow up appointments at this stage to discuss test results etc (but we have ordered a full autopsy) so I can’t say for sure whether we have a reason, but my gut says it was just bad luck.  I do have a general wellness check up with my GP on Monday but in the meantime I feel like there’s questions I want personal experience answers to, since google isn’t really consistent.

Just things like, when sex is possible again, when I could start trying to conceive again (if I wanted to), more looking for what other people’s experiences with that are rather than what a doctor would recommend. How long did you bleed for after and when did you get your first period after?

Because my boy was so little, I have basically no physical trauma from the birth, my bleeding has already majorly slowed down only 5 days post birth (it wasn’t even really heavy to begin with), in a lot of ways I’m feeling physically pretty normal and don’t feel like it’s going to take me 6 weeks to recover. I can do my pelvic floor exercises well beyond the recommendations with no difficulty. I wouldn’t say I was super fit before/during the pregnancy but being a horse rider my pelvic floor and abs were pretty strong and that has probably helped them bounce back quickly. 

I’m obviously still processing everything and feeling really muddled and sad and not sure what to think or feel. It has been strangely comforting to read everyone’s stories here - I think it’s just knowing that I’m not alone, and also not alone in having this happen for “no reason” - so I am more than happy for you to share your stories with me here too.

Yesterday afternoon I was a slightly concerned pregnant lady dealing with ""normal first trimester spotting!""

Last night was the worst, hardest most awful night of my life. Spotting made way for full blown gushing and severe cramps. after seeing a doctor who told me to monitor the situation overnight, I spent the rest of the night crying in the dark huddled in pain trying not to wake my sleeping partner. The whole night felt like a nightmare I couldn't wake up from

I went to the ER this morning because the pain was so bad. 

This morning I am a woman with declining HCG levels and and emptying womb.

I feel so stupid. I had just told my parents they were going to be grandparents for the first time. My dad was happier than I had ever seen him in my life.

We had a trip planned this weekend so we could tell my partners parents in person.

So here I am, back to square one.

I know it's the old cliche but I never thought this would happen to me.

If anyone has any tips on how to stay sane over the next few days it will be greatly appreciated. 💕

I feel like I never truly gave as much thought and love as I should have to people who went through this before I experienced it myself. This will probably be a long post, I think I’m ready to talk about it and ask questions, thanks for reading, 

I started seeing my gynae in January because I had a really long cycle, I’m usually irregular but this was particularly long - he checked me out and straight away suspected endometriosis because my ovaries looked strange but said he wanted to take a look again after I’d had a cycle and would refer me to a specialist after that. Cycle came along, went back and nothing had changed - he wrote a referral and a week before I was meant to see the specialist boom pregnant, 

I had a completely healthy happy pregnancy till it wasn’t anymore, I’m fit and young - all scans were great, NT scan doctor said our little girl was a textbook baby. Fast forward to 16 weeks and I woke up in the middle of the night suddenly bleeding and I know now that I knew then already it was all over and I started mourning that night.  Went to see my doctor and he said I had placenta previa - unfortunately bleeding was a symptom and it was likely to happen again but there wasn’t much to be done aside from rest and he prescribed progesterone. She still had a strong heartbeat and otherwise seemed great. 

I was bleeding on and off till 18 weeks and just kept telling myself it was just a symptom, I read everything I could on low lying placentas, all the positive stories but I just knew things weren’t right. At 18.5 weeks I was in the shower, reached down there and something was sticking out that shouldn’t have been - when I looked it was like a little rope and I knew it was the umbilical cord. Rushed to the doctor and he confirmed it was and that he couldn’t do anything to save our baby. He said in his 25 years of practicing he’d never seen an umbilical cord prolapse in the second trimester nor with a placenta previa and didn’t know how it was even possible. I was admitted to hospital on the spot, I was given misoprostol the next morning to help things along and late that night she passed naturally.  

The tests that were done said that an infection caused the reaction. Doc said hopefully lightning doesn’t strike twice and we won’t do anything differently next time, to wait 3months and go for a swab to see if there’s any lingering infection (I was put on heavy antibiotics after miscarrying) and then we’ll be cleared in September to start trying again hopefully. 

Has anybody else experienced a prolapsed cord in their second tri? I have so many questions - do I have an incompetent cervix? Was it because my blood type is negative and DH is positive - did the bleeding at 16 weeks cause my blood to attack hers that quickly? Was it just a simple avoidable yeast infection that caused a PPROM? Did the suspected endometriosis play a role? Doc said that I had no trouble getting pregnant so I shouldn’t be concerned about that when trying again. I honestly want to just tell him to stitch up my cervix as soon as we’re pregnant to avoid it happening again but don’t know if I’m being irrational and if it was really just a fluke. 

I don’t know what I’m really hoping to hear, but any positive rainbow baby stories after experiencing anything similar to any of my issues would be so appreciated and welcome. 

Again I’m just so deeply sorry you all went through your losses and I have nothing but love for all of you and our little lost souls.

68,2048,confidence,<praw.reddit.Reddit object at 0x7f12a630cd90>,,ttcafterloss,"Hi all,

I'm twenty-five and my husband and I have had four miscarriages in the past year, one blighted ovum, one trisomy 16, and two ""chemical"" pregnancies. The blighted ovum was my first pregnancy and the trisomy 16 was last one. These lasted 9 weeks each until intervention with my T16 growth stopped at 6 weeks, but my the gestational sacs continued to grow until medical intervention. My two chemicals my hcg started some level under 100 when blood tested and went down from their, but both were after my period was due. 

I've had all the testing done. My AMH is an 8 which my RE can't decide if it is PCOS and looking at my ovaries said it could be lots of follicles instead of cysts. She said I could just be ""young and fertile"" and it's not necessarily PCOS. On pregnant and not pregnant cycles I've had low progesterone - it was an 8 on a cycle where I ovulated but did not conceive on CD 21. My husband is normal except his morphology which is 2.5% (strict) so it is pretty low. He is also twenty-five. We both did karotyping and neither of us have any abnormalities that were picked up by that.

Based on the abnormality in the last pregnancy, I'm beginning to think that they were all abnormal pregnancies as a blighted ovum usually is and so are chemical pregnancies. I used to think it was a lack of hormonal support but I know if they are abnormal, no amount of hormonal support would have saved them.

I am trying to figure out our odds for a healthy pregnancy without IVF with PGD. If I don't count the chemical pregnancies, my odds of the next pregnancy being healthy is good. If I do count them, my odds are lower. Do chemical pregnancies count towards odds of future loss? Is the two pregnancies I experienced considered ""chemical""? My OB said that they weren't chemical because they occurred after my period was due, but I thought until something is visualized on an ultrasound.

Also, does anyone have any idea why two twenty-five year olds would be having so many chromosomal losses in a years time? Is it his morphology or my potential PCOS?

Hey.  I'm back.

Naively never thought I'd ever have to make a post in here after my last 20 week miscarriage  (baby measured 16 weeks, we last heard the heartbeat at 17.5w). I had placenta abruption but after doing a huge blood disorder panel, they determined it was most likely a ""fluke"" and shouldn't happen again.

Fast forward to yesterday, when I find out I miscarried at 10 weeks. I went from a perfect 7 week scan with 161bpm, and everything looked great, to dead fetus 3 weeks later. 

2 days before I was told baby didn't have a heartbeat, we heard it on an at-home Doppler. Then 1 day later, I was having spotting, and the day after that I was told there was no heartbeat. The OB said baby was measuring 9w6d, so literally died the day before. What are the odds?

I'm writing this as I lay in bed waiting to get the phone call for my suction thing (forget what it's called but it's not a D&C), feeling so fucking defeated after having this happen again. I made sure not to get too attached to the baby until I felt like I was far enough along to be ""safe"", but I got so attached to the due date. I found out I was pregnant on my birthday, and we were due on my husband's birthday. I thought it was finally perfect.

Theory: 

When the On-call OB read my chart he was shocked that the baby had been measuring so perfectly only a few weeks before. 

So my theory is that I probably have low progesterone? When I'm pregnant I'm hardly ever nauseous, my boobs aren't sore, the only symptoms I get are exhaustion and some dizziness but that's about it. I know progesterone can be linked to having stronger symptoms like nausea and boob tenderness so, maybe that's it? Its obviously something in MY body that keeps fucking this up, and can't think of anything else it could be since blood disorders were ruled out but even as a precaution I was on low dose aspirin.

Can anyone think of anything else I can mention to my doctor? 
Besides a blood disorder, low progesterone, a heart shaped uterus (I don't have that) I can't think of anything else that can mess with the baby??

My heart can't take another loss, and if it's something that is fixable I'd love to figure it out before trying again. Im heartbroken.

<p>2 days before I was told baby didn&#39;t have a heartbeat, we heard it on an at-home Doppler. Then 1 day later, I was having spotting, and the day after that I was told there was no heartbeat. The OB said baby was measuring 9w6d, so literally died the day before. What are the odds?</p>

<p>I&#39;m writing this as I lay in bed waiting to get the phone call for my suction thing (forget what it&#39;s called but it&#39;s not a D&amp;C), feeling so fucking defeated after having this happen again. I made sure not to get too attached to the baby until I felt like I was far enough along to be &quot;safe&quot;, but I got so attached to the due date. I found out I was pregnant on my birthday, and we were due on my husband&#39;s birthday. I thought it was finally perfect.</p>

<p>Theory: </p>

<p>When the On-call OB read my chart he was shocked that the baby had been measuring so perfectly only a few weeks before. </p>

<p>So my theory is that I probably have low progesterone? When I&#39;m pregnant I&#39;m hardly ever nauseous, my boobs aren&#39;t sore, the only symptoms I get are exhaustion and some dizziness but that&#39;s about it. I know progesterone can be linked to having stronger symptoms like nausea and boob tenderness so, maybe that&#39;s it? Its obviously something in MY body that keeps fucking this up, and can&#39;t think of anything else it could be since blood disorders were ruled out but even as a precaution I was on low dose aspirin.</p>

<p>Can anyone think of anything else I can mention to my doctor? 
Besides a blood disorder, low progesterone, a heart shaped uterus (I don&#39;t have that) I can&#39;t think of anything else that can mess with the baby??</p>

<p>My heart can&#39;t take another loss, and if it&#39;s something that is fixable I&#39;d love to figure it out before trying again. Im heartbroken. </p>

<p>Thanks for reading </p>

He died an hour and a half after birth. Our world was shattered but we moved forward. We decided to begin trying to conceive in March and became pregnant in May 2018. We later, at our 6 week scan learned we were having twins! We were over the moon excited and overwhelmed and nervous. Connors condition runs thicker in twins so we decided to wait until I was 20 weeks or after the anatomy scan to announce to the Facebook world but close friends and family knew. We had scans at 6, 8 and 10 weeks to confirm whether they were fraternal or identical, and I had an appointment this passed Friday. My husband couldn't be there since he was in another state on military business and I planned to leave right after this appointment for a week long visit. We figured, this is just the 12 week check up, no big deal. How wrong we were. 
12 weeks is when I thought I was out of the woods, I could relax and not worry about miscarriage. So our doctor (who is wonderful btw) took the fetal doppler, and began looking for heart beats.. and looking.. and looking. Nothing. About 2 minutes in she said she was going to get the sonogram just to make sure. But sometimes at 12 weeks babies hearts are still too small. She went and got it and immediately said ""well they've definitely grown since we've seen the last"", and then she turned the screen to face her, but I was watching her face and I knew. The first one she said had no heart beat. I said ""how do we even go about taking care of that? If the other is healthy...."" and she said ""the second also has no heart beat"".   They measured 11+5.  A D&C was carried out later on the same day.

He died an hour and a half after birth. Our world was shattered but we moved forward. We decided to begin trying to conceive in March and became pregnant in May 2018. We later, at our 6 week scan learned we were having twins! We were over the moon excited and overwhelmed and nervous. Connors condition runs thicker in twins so we decided to wait until I was 20 weeks or after the anatomy scan to announce to the Facebook world but close friends and family knew. We had scans at 6, 8 and 10 weeks to confirm whether they were fraternal or identical, and I had an appointment this passed Friday. My husband couldn&#39;t be there since he was in another state on military business and I planned to leave right after this appointment for a week long visit. We figured, this is just the 12 week check up, no big deal. How wrong we were. 
12 weeks is when I thought I was out of the woods, I could relax and not worry about miscarriage. So our doctor (who is wonderful btw) took the fetal doppler, and began looking for heart beats.. and looking.. and looking. Nothing. About 2 minutes in she said she was going to get the sonogram just to make sure. But sometimes at 12 weeks babies hearts are still too small. She went and got it and immediately said &quot;well they&#39;ve definitely grown since we&#39;ve seen the last&quot;, and then she turned the screen to face her, but I was watching her face and I knew. The first one she said had no heart beat. I said &quot;how do we even go about taking care of that? If the other is healthy....&quot; and she said &quot;the second also has no heart beat&quot;.   They measured 11+5.  A D&amp;C was carried out later on the same day.<br/>

I was quite anxious about miscarriage...but after no serious signs after 8 weeks I started to be hopeful. 9 week ultrasound last Thursday , no heartbeat, 4 mm fetal pole. Cue bawling.

I am scheduled for a D&C on monday. I am very nervous mostly about it affecting future pregnancies and about feeling them doing stuff in there. I don't know if anyone can offer positive stories. All I want to do is try again, my GP said she suggests waiting until first period after D&C but that she has had patients get pregnant after the 2 week waiting period of no sex, and not get their period at all, and go on to have successful pregnancies.

I ordered four books off amazon, then went to the bookstore and bought three more. I did everything perfectly. I excercised every day, ate well, cut out everything I was supposed to.

I'm an anxious person, so I was worried about miscarriage from the beginning. Everyone acted like everything was going fine, so of course it would be fine. At about 7 and a half weeks I started believing them. The riskiest time is 4 to 6 weeks which I had been past, so I was beginning to be very hopeful.

On Monday, July 16th I woke up and felt more tired than I ever had and my stomach hurt. Around 10:30 I had a tiny bit of blood. I freaked out and called my husband and he came home from work. My doctor said that unless it increased to just keep my ultrasound appointment for the next day and wait it out. Even though I was scared I was hoping I was just overreacting. People spot when they are pregnant. It's scary, but normal.

A few hours later the bleeding increased and we were advised to go to the E.R. Everyone that we came into contact with at the E.R. was kind and compassionate and so supportive. They did a pelvic exam, some blood work and an ultrasound. When they brought me into the ultrasound I could hear a baby crying in the other room. My husband wasn't allowed in so he sat in the waiting room. The lady who did the ultrasound explained that she couldn't tell me anything so I needed to calm down becuase it was going to be hours before I got any results. I couldn't see the pictures, but I heard my baby's heart beat.

Finally the doctor came in, he told us that we had a 50% chance of the baby surviving. You could tell on his face what side of the 50% we were going to end up on. They gave me a shot of rogam since I am o- to  help with future pregnancies and we went home to wait.

The next morning at around 5 am I started having bad stomach pains and the blood was beginning to contain tissue. We had our first ultrasound appointment already scheduled for 10:30, so they asked us to still come in to go over our options. I had been waiting for this day for so long.There was a lady with a baby and a little girl sitting next to us in the waiting room and I lost it.

We went in and they had us do a vaginal ultrasound. When we walked in I was crying and the nurse said "" Some women just bleed during pregnancy, you could be fine."" Alex watched the screen but I didn't. The nurse told us that the baby didn't have a heart beat any longer. She left us to get dressed, but she left the picture on the screen.

When people show you ultrasound pictures you act like it is cute, but everyone knows they look like little aliens. My baby didn't. She was perfect. 

The nurse spoke to us and gave us our options. We could try to let it pass naturally or take cytotec to make it quicker. The nurse seemed against the cytotec, but the doctor recomended it, so we ended up taking it. We made an appointment for an ultrasound on Thursday to make sure that everything had passed so I didn't get an infection. They scheduled a D and C for me on Friday if I needed it.

The cytotec was terrible. The contractions were so painful. I don't know how they expect women to do this with just ibuprofen. The pain was so bad that i just screamed while Alex held my hand. After a few hours of pain I passed the majority of it. I will never forget what it felt like when the big pieces came out. I had a panic attack and passed out. Alex had to hold my head so I didn't hurt myself. Up until I felt it pass I thought I had experienced the worst moment of my life many times over the last two days, but that was the worst moment.

I went to the doctor and had an ultrasound and luckily I dont need a d and c. I'm going to go to therapy to help start thinking about trying to conceive again someday.
