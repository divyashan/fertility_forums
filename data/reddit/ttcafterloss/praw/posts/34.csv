My husband and I found out I was pregnant w/my fist pregnancy in early November. We waited until after 10 weeks to start telling most people besides close family, as we had no signs anything was amiss. I just told work last week and more family at Christmas.

We had an ultrasound scheduled for 12/26. We were so excited - my mom came too. The sonographer couldn't find a heartbeat. I couldn't even see a baby bean on the u/s. She said the gestational sac looked far too small for 11 weeks. Since then my blood tests have confirmed my HCG levels are rapidly dropping.

We had been planning to announce publicly this week. We took our announcement picture Christmas night and excitedly talked about what it would be like seeing baby on the u/s. I started bleeding Wednesday and saw my doc yesterday, confirming I'd had missed miscarriage. The doc thinks baby was only about 4-6 wks along...the idea that my pregnancy had been lost for so long without knowing is really f-ing w/my brain.

I was prescribed Misoprostol, which I took 5 hours ago.  I still haven't started feeling any effects and am starting to feel like I'm going crazy.  My doc told me the worst of it should be over by 6-7 hrs after dosing, yet I haven't experienced anything?  Emotionally I feel like I have come to terms with things.

6,2048,confidence,<praw.reddit.Reddit object at 0x7f12a630cd90>,,ttcafterloss,"Hi everyone,

I have had it confirmed today that I am experiencing my 4th pregnancy loss.  I did have a son in between those two; he was conceived via IVF.  Before he arrived, I had an ectopic pregnancy and then an early miscarriage (could be considered chemical).

Earlier this year we decided to give IVF another go.  We had two frozen embryos from his cycle and put them both in.  One stuck until it didn't (we found out at the 8 week ultrasound that there was no longer a heartbeat).

We tried again.  This time I had to go through egg retrieval again.  Everything seemed so synchronous.  The way the timing worked out, the egg retrieval and transfer date were the exact same dates that we did this for my son in 2013.  I thought for sure that was a definitive sign from the universe that this was it.

The ultrasounds were scary from the beginning.  The first one showed no yolk sac, the second one had a heartbeat but was measuring a few days behind.  So, we waited for two weeks to get this ultrasound.  I felt positive because my morning sickness and sore bb's were high.  And yet, we found out today that the embryo only measured 6 weeks 6 days (at what is technically 9 weeks) and that there was no heartbeat.

I reacted much differently than I thought (and how I reacted back in June).  Today, I was calm, rationale and immediately wanted to schedule the procedure and opted for genetic testing.  I feel numb.  

I also feel pissed, scared, resentful of other people who are pregnant (including a friend who is about a week ahead of me and is 4 years older - I am 39 - and has not experienced a miscarriage; she seems to just breeze through all her appointments).  I also feel relieved.  My anxiety that centers around analyzing every little symptom is gone.  

I know I don't have to make any decisions now, but I have been thinking - really considering - if I can go through this again.  I don't know if I can.  I want another child but I just don't know if I can take the whole IVF cycle and waiting and stressing.  And I just don't know how I feel about donor eggs or adoption.

How have you come to that next step decision?  Do you just know when it is time to move on to donor eggs or adoption or to stopping?  Does acceptance just happen and wash over you?

Any experience, strength and hope is appreciated.

We joked because at the time of our marriage, none of his sisters were even dating.

I guess the universe thought it was funny because my biggest fear came true. On Christmas day, one week after my due date, my younger sister in law announced she was 13 weeks pregnant. She is married and pregnant with a guy she has known less than 2 years.

I just feel so gutted. Everything I dreamed of having has been taken by her. I feel so petty for thinking this way. My husband and I have been trying almost as long as her entire relationship, and she gets pregnant a month after their wedding. The doctors still don't have an answers for why I can't get pregnant. I was already having a hard time with Christmas thinking ""I should have had my baby for today"", and then this unexpected bombshell was dropped. She told me that she didn't plan to have kids for awhile, and suddenly she is bragging about being a mom.

I haven't slept much since Christmas. I wake up every night and cry thinking of my loss and going over the ""what if's"". I've been planning and reading about pregnancy longer than she has known her husband. I just imagine her giving me unsolicited advice because ""she did it first"". It stings because honestly I question most of her life choices up to this point. I don't want to be compared to her.

We never told his or my family about the loss. I feel like we have to tell them now. My husband and I disappeared for almost an hour so we could cry. The next morning, my MIL cornered my husband to ask if I was ok. He tried to dodge the question and it led to her asking if we were trying. I couldn't even look at my SIL or her husband because I was afraid I would break down. I'm pretty sure everyone noticed.

I don't want my inlaws to think this is anger/jealousy because she ""beat me"". I wasnt them to understand that this is just salt in the wound. I am so scared to tell them, but maybe it is for he better. I've been thinking I should tell my mom, but never knew how to bring it up. I guess this is a reason to now.

Hi everyone, I've been lurking here since my first CP at 6 weeks back in July, and now am currently experiencing my 2nd, just shy of 6 weeks. The thing is, both times I had a feeling they weren't going to go well because the test lines would NOT darken. Like half as dark as the control at most. Also I had HCG levels drawn this time and it went up from 70 to 105 over the course of 2 days. Not good. And yet, you can search similar stories on here, cautiousBB and line porn and they all have the same comments from people how it's probably fine! Oh you have a 90hr doubling rate and super low HCG at 5 weeks? Probably fine! Lines still super light at 5 weeks? It's just the hook effect or you didn't hold long enough or you drank too much water. Are these kinds of comments actually helpful to people? I have been too afraid to post my questions because I didn't want this false positivity. The truth seems to be, especially in very early pregnancy, if your HCG isn't doubling normally it most likely won't end well. If the tests don't darken eventually, at some point you have to accept that a line isn't just a line, yes you are pregnant but it unfortunately might not be a viable pregnancy! There's also ectopic to worry about which can cause serious health risks and a sign is not normally doubling HCG levels. Giving false positivity in those cases could actually be dangerous. 

I'm sorry to be such a bitch about what I'm sure are well meaning comments. It's not like I've had the balls to comment on these posts either and tell them it doesn't look good.... It doesn't help that there were so many babies at Christmas this year while I sat there wearing my granny pad, worried it would fill up and I'd have to throw it away in my inlaws trash and someone would see (weird worry I know).

24,2048,confidence,<praw.reddit.Reddit object at 0x7f12a630cd90>,,ttcafterloss,"Hi everyone - 

I wanted to share with you my experience in total and the outcome of today's doc appointment in hopes that this can help others with repeat pregnancy loss. As many of you know, I've been advocating for treatment since April of this year, just 4 months after my first loss. My first loss ended around 4-5 weeks, as did my second, and now my third. For this loss, I am on progesterone and have not started bleeding yet but I'm positive if I had not been on suppositories, the bleeding would have started or would start today/tomorrow. My HCG was 154 last Monday and 13 yesterday. 

Yesterday I woke up and temped for the first time in a few days. I know I shouldnt temp after a BFP but I did here and there. My temp dropped from 98.4/98.6 over the last few weeks to 97.9. I decided to test. We'd just announced to everyone around Christmas and so much happiness came out of it. So many happy tears. My heart was full and I felt so, so blessed. But I hadn't really been feeling any symptoms other than the progesterone type ones (sore boobs). I felt like, too good, if that makes sense. I tested out of the desire to see a blazing positive and also the need to prepare myself for potential bad results from my ultrasound on Friday. To me, nothing seemed worse than walking in thinking I'd see a sac or heartbeat and seeing nothing. I wanted to prepare. As you may have seen in my spiraling out of control, POAS addict posts yesterday, I took like 10 tests, all which were negative or very faint. Once the digital was negative after being positive a week earlier, I knew it was over. 

I showed my husband, we looked at all the tests together, diluted them to test for the hook effect, no go. I sobbed ""NO NO NO"" on his chest and I laid on the bathroom floor naked and crying with my head in his lap. It hurt so bad. We went to the Urgent Care - I told them I was there for piece of mind and that I felt ""different"" so I took a test and it was negative. They took my blood and I went home, tossed and turned all night, sweating profusely and having nightmares of miscarriage and breaking the news to my loved ones. I woke up from my half-sleep at 7:30am and that half hour before I could call for my results felt like years. The nurse told me my HCG was 13 and to have a nice day. I called my RE's office and they wanted me to come in. I got a scan, there was nothing there but thickened lining. 

Then, I saw the 3rd RE I've seen at this clinic. I only saw RE #3 because RE #2 was on vacation. You might remember that RE #1 was bedside manner horror show man and retired.  RE #3 sat us down and said ""I want to start off by saying that I am sitting here because I have been sitting where you two have. My wife and I were 0/8 and now we have 2 kids. I know how you're feeling. It's a horrible pain. I went back to school to help others. We can help"" and I sobbed. He gave me tissues. On paper he outlined the different reasons for repeat pregnancy loss at 4-5 weeks. He said 1) Anatomy - my anatomy looks good, 2) Blood vessel issues - although I have had a lot of testing, two things I have not been tested for are the MTHFR gene mutation and Factor 5 Leiden. He said the prevalence of Factor 5 in our state is 8%, quite high. The final issue is 3) Immunity issues - specifically, Killer T cells. All of these I researched back in April before visiting this RE's office and I was tested for none of these, although I wanted to be. Getting pregnant with #2 and the drama that ensued with that made me less forceful about the testing. After all, I had surgery and they found stuff to correct, so I thought I must be all good. People told me ""I think you've just had really shitty luck"".  

This doctor said I have NOT had shitty luck and this is not a fluke and that something is most likely wrong. He also said redheads are particularly vulnerable to repro issues, such as endo and immune system issues. So, making my long story even longer - he wants to test me for MTHFR, Factor 5, and then the Killer T cells. He gave me his email and cell phone and said to call or email at any time. He said with my age, I only have a 10-12% chance of conceiving in any cycle. That's the first time anyone has brought that up to me. Did not feel good. But he said he ""didn't blow smoke"" and he tells it like it is. He was well-researched and said he does not favor baby aspirin, steroids, progesterone, white blood cell transfers between partners (wtf), or IvIg infusions. What he does favor are intralipid infusions. I will cease progesterone and bleed in a few days. I am to call when I start my period next cycle and we'll move forward. I'm sad that I haven't had these easy tests sooner and that I've suffered two losses in the meantime. 

But I left a very sad appointment with a plan - with some hope for the future. I want to work with this man and I feel he can help us. I'll go all the way to IVF if we must to have a baby. I am so sad for all of those folks we announced to in such cute ways - building them up with such happiness and then bringing them down. I'm heartbroken. I felt so, so good about this one. I thought it would stick. I felt the baby would be strong and I'd bring him or her home. I really did. 

I'm taking today to break the news to everyone all at once. I do not want to retell my story over and over to those that know our journey to this point. I'm pulling off the bandaid now - getting it all over with. I emailed some coworkers I work closely with and told them to be patient with me and that I will likely work from home or close my door and it's not them, it's me, and I need their support but also distance. I don't know how I'll handle this. I have two losses under my belt now so I know how to do it. I know its foolish to think I can be okay just because I don't want to feel sad anymore, but I also don't feel like dragging out my grief. While I've had three, count them, fucking *three* losses, I am still grateful that they've been early. While I've been gutted by the loss of the dreams and hopes and excitement that these three pregnancies brought, I have not had to suffer the loss of a baby that I've grown an attachment to, like many of you have. I know we don't compare losses here, but if there's any silver lining I can focus on in this shit show of a year, it's that, I suppose. 

Fucking hell I wrote a novel. If you made it this far, thanks for reading. I just needed to write it all out. Thanks to everyone who has sent rats and hearts and sympathy. You all are my tribe and I know you're with me. It means so much.

I was chatting with u/mermaidfart08 the other day about how much waiting to try sucks, and maybe we should come up with a 30 day challenge to help pass the time. But I want it to be fun! Or at least, more fun than a 30 day plank challenge!

I did some googling trying to come up with a good idea, and honestly, there's so many, that I think I'd like this to be a Choose Your Own Adventure 30 Day Challenge. I'm going to post some ideas below, and then you've got 4 days or so to plan what you want to do in January. I'll post a daily thread starting January 1st where we can chat about what we're doing. I would like it to be TTC and pregnancy talk free.

My current goals:
- Resume daily meditation (Headspace App, might also try Calm)
- Read for 30 minutes every day. For fun! Academic reading doesn't count unless it's a book I'm enjoying and not having to force myself to read.
- And I'm thinking about adding something in for my marriage. Not sure what. I already make him tea every morning. Maybe send him an email every day that's positive in some way? Like, a favorite poem, cute picture, etc. Ooh, I could do a 30 day sexy snap challenge! I think I'm only half kidding.

And my less fun goals include: Dental appointment, Make dermatology appointment, Find a new primary care provider, Make a car maintenance appointment, exercise more. 

Challenge ideas!

* [Apartment Therapy January Cure!](http://www.apartmenttherapy.com/categories/the-january-cure) Get organized and clean up your place! Which for some people, is actually fun (I'm planning on doing some tidying but not on a daily basis).
* [Journaling Challenge](http://www.popsugar.com/smart-living/Journaling-Challenge-42860000) There's 150 prompts here so you could pick 30 that you like.
* [Relationship Challenge](http://www.popsugar.com/love/30-Day-Relationship-Challenge-35253795) This one looks a bit too intense for me, but again, it's a place to start for ideas.
* [30 Day Kindness Challenge](http://www.popsugar.com/smart-living/30-Day-Kindess-Challenge-35664620) I'm way too much of a hermit.
* [Some Simple Self Care Challenge Ideas](http://www.sarahsteckler.com/101-30-day-self-care-challenge-ideas/)

A bit of background - 

1 - About 9 months ago we had our first loss -  a missed miscarriage. The baby probably died between 6 and 7 weeks, we found out around week 10 and used misoprostol to start the actual miscarriage at week 11. After this, I had a bit of testing done. We found and treated subclinical hypothyroidism and vitamin D deficiency. Found out that I'm a carrier for the C677T MTHFR mutation and my husband is a carrier for the A1298C MTHFR mutation, so we both started trying to avoid folic acid and switched our vitamins to ones with methylfolate.

2 - We waited a couple months to try again. Once we started trying, we conceived very quickly but lost the baby between 4 and 5 weeks. Blood tests showed very low progesterone post-peak, so my doctor recommended taking progesterone suppositories. 

3-4  We conceived two more times and lost them between weeks 4 and 5 again. More testing showed that high prolactin (probably left over from the first miscarriage) was probably keeping my progesterone low. My doctor recommended treating the high prolactin with a drug called cabergoline to see if that helped. 

5 - We conceived again the first cycle using cabergoline. The initial HCG numbers for the baby were great - on P+15 and P+17 (4 weeks 1 day and 3 days) the numbers were 450 and 1100, so really good doubling. This was much different than our chemical pregnancies, where the numbers were almost always falling by the time I'd missed my period. On P+21 (5 weeks), HCG was only 2000 though, so doubling had really slowed. And on P+23, two days later, HCG had fallen back to 450, confirming miscarriage. I started bleeding about a week later at 6 weeks.

I've had some other testing done too, but for the most part, it's all shown that I'm in good health:

* Ultrasound to check for structural abnormalities, ovarian cysts, etc. Everything looked good.

* Hormones - Checked LH, FSH, estrogen, progesterone, testosterone, and prolactin at various points in my cycle. Aside from high prolactin after the first miscarriage, everything has looked normal.

* Autoimmune issues - We started by checking for Hashimotos, an autoimmune issue that is the most common cause of hypothyroidism. This involves testing for thyroid peroxidase antibodies, thyrogloblobulin antibodies, and a few others. Nothing was even slightly elevated. Also tested for rheumatoid factor, the ana ifa screening test, and HS CRP (marker for some autoimmune issues).

* Blood clotting - Cardiolipin AB (IGA, IGG, IGM), Protein C and Protein S, Prothrombin (Factor 2), Lupus anti-coagulant, Anti-thrombin III activity and antigen, Factor V (Leiden). Everything was well within range.

* Adrenal problems - We tested for these after ruling out Hashimotos, because they can also cause thyroid problems. Tested Hydroxyprogesterone, Androstendedione.

* Genetic problems - My husband was really worried about genetic issues, but without strong family history our insurance doesn't cover testing. My doctor recommend 23&me for general screening. It didn't flag anything so we haven't pursued further testing.

We're having trouble deciding whether we should keep looking for problems or just give up and hope that we'll eventually get lucky. On one hand, we know that any of these losses, maybe even all of them, could have been chromosomal and out of our control. On the other hand, testing has revealed some issues that increased our risk of miscarriage and allowed us to treat them.

I'd really appreciate your thoughts on any of this. Very conflicted about all of it.

<li><p>Hormones - Checked LH, FSH, estrogen, progesterone, testosterone, and prolactin at various points in my cycle. Aside from high prolactin after the first miscarriage, everything has looked normal.</p></li>
<li><p>Autoimmune issues - We started by checking for Hashimotos, an autoimmune issue that is the most common cause of hypothyroidism. This involves testing for thyroid peroxidase antibodies, thyrogloblobulin antibodies, and a few others. Nothing was even slightly elevated. Also tested for rheumatoid factor, the ana ifa screening test, and HS CRP (marker for some autoimmune issues).</p></li>
<li><p>Blood clotting - Cardiolipin AB (IGA, IGG, IGM), Protein C and Protein S, Prothrombin (Factor 2), Lupus anti-coagulant, Anti-thrombin III activity and antigen, Factor V (Leiden). Everything was well within range.</p></li>
<li><p>Adrenal problems - We tested for these after ruling out Hashimotos, because they can also cause thyroid problems. Tested Hydroxyprogesterone, Androstendedione.</p></li>
<li><p>Genetic problems - My husband was really worried about genetic issues, but without strong family history our insurance doesn&#39;t cover testing. My doctor recommend 23&amp;me for general screening. It didn&#39;t flag anything so we haven&#39;t pursued further testing.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>We&#39;re having trouble deciding whether we should keep looking for problems or just give up and hope that we&#39;ll eventually get lucky. On one hand, we know that any of these losses, maybe even all of them, could have been chromosomal and out of our control. On the other hand, testing has revealed some issues that increased our risk of miscarriage and allowed us to treat them.</p>

<p>I&#39;d really appreciate your thoughts on any of this. Very conflicted about all of it. I had been pretty hopeful that this fifth pregnancy might work out and that&#39;s definitely been crushed.</p>

I wanted to bring this to the attention of someone else that might be having this issue because I think I have it and it took me a year to come across this.
The basic idea is that there are some women that are so fertile, get pregnant so easily, but at the same time are so prone to early chemicals and pregnancy loss due to poor quality embryos (that would otherwise be rejected by non-super/hyper fertile people) being allowed to implant resulting in a temporary pregnancy. :( 
I thought this idea was very interesting as I am searching for answers.
 From what I am reading, the TREATMENT for super fertility is just progesterone pessaries starting from 7 DPO (which I feel might be late. I think you should start at 3-5 DPO) and then every once in a while a healthy embryo is going to stick and you will just have a happy healthy pregnancy without treatment.

""Prof Nick Macklon, a consultant at the Princess Anne Hospital, said: ""Many affected women feel guilty that they are simply rejecting their pregnancy.
""But we have discovered it may not be because they cannot carry, [but] it is because they may simply be super-fertile, as they allow embryos which would normally not survive to implant.""

This blog post listed Hyper Fertility Markers:
""
- Periods often start at a very young age, usually around 9-10 years old.

- Cycles are textbook regular, always 27-28 days in duration.

- After a miscarriage up to 24 weeks, periods often return exactly 28 days later after the miscarriage occurs.

- After a stillbirth or full term pregnancy (post 24 weeks) locia (bleeding) occurs for up to 2 weeks or more. With hyper fertility locia will last a week to ten days, and periods will return exactly 27-28 days later from the last day of locia occurring. The only exception to this is if the mother breastfeeds post-partum.

- There is no natural decline of egg quality or egg reserves with age. A woman in her early 40’s will typically have egg quality and an egg reserve of someone in their early to mid 30’s. AMH and FSH blood tests will detect egg quality and egg reserves.

- The lining of the womb in a woman with hyper fertility will need to be brought back to optimum levels by using progesterone pessaries, typically 200mg, from day 21 of her cycle if she is trying to conceive. She should take a pregnancy test at 27-28 days and if the test is negative, stop the pessaries in order for her period to start. If she tests positive, she should up the dose to anything from 400mg to 800mg. A mild dose or course of steroids can also help prepare the lining of the womb for a pregnancy to implant successfully.

- A woman with hyper fertility will often experience losses at a very early stage after implantation, typically 7-10 days after finding out she is pregnant if she is testing for pregnancy using today’s sophisticated early tests. This is due to the lining of the womb being over stimulated and the embryo not being able to implant, attach and grow successfully.

- Occasionally, even without treatment, the lining of a woman’s womb some months will allow implantation to occur and a pregnancy to develop normally.""

When I came off BC, my cycles were incredibly short. It was lucky for me to reach CD21. My doctor booked me in with an OBGYN which was a 3 month wait. I found out 10 days before my appointment that I, by some miracle, was pregnant. I called the obgyn to ask if I should come in just in case and the receptionist rudely told me no and cancelled my appointment. I started to miscarry the day after my scheduled appointment.

 

It took another 4 months before I could get into the obgyn again. By this time, we had been trying for over a year. I was told to get CD3 and CD21 blood work done, and my husband was to get an SA. CD3 and SA were done right away, but I could not make it to CD21. The first tests came back astounding, so my obgyn sent me for and HSG, and told me to get CD21 done when I can. This is the 4th cycle since he told me to get the blood work done. I never made it past CD19.

 

I had my HSG done 1.5 weeks ago, and both tubes were clear. All that is left is CD21 blood work. When I went to book my appointment, I realized that CD21 also happened to be my due date....today. I actually laughed like a maniac because HOW CRUEL CAN THE UNIVERSE BE!?!?!

 

Well I have my blood work in 4 hours, and AF has not come! I have been so afraid of jinxing it, that I was scared to say anything to anyone. At this point I don't even care anymore. Instead of seeing today as bad, I have been trying to see it as a positive sign. I made it to CD21 on my due date. I will get my blood work done. I have already booked my follow up appointment to go over the results. 

 

It is not until the end of January, but at this point I am just so happy that I will have answers. Once I have that appointment, we will be able to discuss options going forward. I feel like I finally have some traction in TTC.

After seeing a number of different OBGYN's and midwives from 2 states and 3 different practices, it wasn't until we met with a Reproductive Endocrinologist that this condition was even mentioned. I had never heard of it in all my research.

Long story short, it took a saline ultrasound (ouch, btw) and a pelvic MRI to confirm that I have a septum in my uterus. The RE explained to us that this causes miscarriage because when the embryo implants to the septum part (which looks and acts like a normal uterine lining), there is not enough blood flow and the baby eventually dies. This also explains why the chromosome tests on baby #1 came back normal. Unfortunately we were not able to test the others.

Anyway, I will need surgery to remove the septum, and then we can TTC. I should be scheduled for surgery within the next 6 weeks. I wanted to post this to ask if anyone has had similar experience, because I refuse to Google, for once in my life. And also, I wanted to share because I had never heard of this before and had I known, maybe I would have advocated a lot sooner to get tested for this specific condition.

 Low side of normal for total count (91m, seems fine to me)
Motility at the ""bottom value of normal""  (""20"" ? The clinician couldn't explain what that meant. 20% activity? a 2.0 on quality?  20% sounds way below average, a 2.0 is average) 
66% abnormal shape (doctor looks for  <50%). 

Clinic is saying he should be referred to a urologist, but then if you look online all those values are in the normal range but the activity if that's a %. Just all kind of near the bottom.  We'll get detailed results in the mail next week.  

I'm not sure what to make of it.  I actually find it kind of comforting, it looks like an explanation of why we can get pregnant but also an explanation for why it's taking a bit longer than I hoped. Kind of grasping at straws of meaning, the illusion of control. 


I'm also pretty unsure any of this can be treated and we're definitely not ready to move to IUI, and our insurance doesn't cover infertility unless it's a medical condition. So far insurance has been good at covering diagnosis and Rx treatment for impotence and I'm still not convinced these aren't correlated. 

So I'm not really sure where this leaves us. This ""what now?"" feeling is why I wanted to wait on the SA but husband really wanted it done and well, it's his sperm.  Maybe it will be the inspiration he needs to really crack down on his weight loss and cutting out alcohol (he gained 65 pounds back on meds last year).  

I'm also looking for insight if those numbers mean we should be having more sex or keeping it to every other day for quality? The month of my loss we hit 4 out of 5 fertile days, but we've hit at least 1 or 2 every month for 9. (For ref I'm 33, he's 35, we're TTC #1) Grasping at straws here.

We found out we loss our second pregnancy in January. The baby had passed almost 4 weeks before, at 15 weeks. I chose to have a d&amp;e because of a previous c-section. It took a few months before we were ready to try again, and we found out I was pregnant again in September.
My doctor referred me to a high risk doctor, so I&#39;ve had plenty of ultrasounds and appointments up until now. We found out this baby was a girl 3 weeks ago, and everything looked great. This morning was our 18 week ultrasound. Our baby girl no longer has a heartbeat. I&#39;ve now had back to back second trimester loses. I have to have another d&amp;e next week. This wasn&#39;t supposed to happen again.</p>

I was pointed to come here for support during this nightmare from the friendly ladies at r/babybumps. I've posted there about my entire journey to finding out. 

Our quad screen was positive for down syndrome so we were referred to a specialist for a LVL2 ultrasound. The results of this were worse than we expected. 
 
Hypoplastic Left Heart Syndrome, Cystic Hygroma and Hydrops Fetalis. 

The doctor thinks we will loose her within the next 4-8 weeks. 

Living in Texas the laws are so horrible, that even so we are not sure we will be able to legally terminate. We'd probably have to go out of state. Since I'm officially at 20+2 weeks. And we want to wait for the results of the amniocentesis we had on monday. 

I'm so, so torn. I change my mind about terminating and not terminating every 20 minutes. I want nothing more than the doctors to be wrong. But I know deep down they're not. I can't take care of my toddler because i'm so on edge. I can pull through until around 4 and then I'm so exhausted mentally, that I don't want my 19 month old around, I can't deal with her tantrums, I cry and I don't even want her to cuddle with me. 

I'm mad with myself for this. I'm also blaming myself. I was never sure I wanted this baby. When we learned that I was pregnant my reaction was ""Oh shit"" it was not planned. I had no connection to her. I just wanted her to ""be gone"". I'm already seeing a therapist for prenatal depression. I have not have an appointment since we received the news. I've since spiraled. I can't sleep. I don't want to eat. I don't see the point in anything and I break down regularly. 

I always wanted my children to be close in age. My oldest would have been just 2 when this baby would have been born.Now this will not happen. Instead of looking for a crib we need to decide on a burial or cremation. I just can't take this anymore. I don't know how to deal with this pain. I've never cut or anything but the fantasy keeps popping up when I break down. And I'm afraid one day I will act on it.

Edit bc my toddler hit submit too early:

I still want kids close in age, but I cana't even imagine having sex after this.

My doctor hasn't confirmed a loss, but last week at our 8w u/s there wasn't much to see, just a sac, no pole or heartbeat as far as we can tell.  They booked me for a repeat u/s in 10 days, hoping my dates are wrong (spoiler alert, they're not!) and told me to call if I started bleeding. Then they handed me a bag of prenatal samples.  

They tested my progesterone that day , but not hcg. Progesterone was at 2.9, and the office wouldn't confirm but I took that to mean I was going to miscarry, based on Dr. Google. On Friday I'm pretty sure I did.  From wednesday to now, actually, and I have another u/s tmrw to confirm. From what I've read, it sounds like I had things pretty easy as far as natural m/c goes. 

I had to beg them to see me prior to this Friday. They seem really laid back about the whole thing.  When I started bleeding I called, and they just told me to call if the bleeding got worse.  So I called, they said call if it got worse again. My heart rate is way down (total nosedive since Wednesday) and I'm pretty sure I know what I saw come out of me this weekend.  They finally agreed to see me for the repeat tomorrow since I've now stopped bleeding. 

Instead of a bag of prenatal samples, I would've appreciated some pads and a pamphlet entitled ""What to Expect when You're Expecting...a Miscarriage."" My husband was still holding out hope because nobody really confirmed anything at the office that day. I tried to prepare him, but it's hard. He's crushed. 

I'm heartbroken that this baby wasn't meant to be, and I just want the whole thing to be over so that we can try again.  

But if I'm not pregnant and everything has passed, I'd like to get confirmation and get back to, TTC, to my normal workouts and to have a drink.  It's a special kind of torture that we have to spend such a stressful, painful time without certain vices or coping mechanisms. Or fucking insertive sex.

I'm frustrated since here I was thinking I was pregnant for 5 weeks and all along something was wrong.  What kinds of things should I be asking my doctor for next time I get a positive?

I put on 5lb during the 15w I was pregnant and another 5lb since and that number is only going to go up at this point because I cannot.stop.eating 😞

I've always been an emotional eater but this is the worst it's ever been. I REALLY don't want to start another pregnancy at a higher weight but I don't know how to get this under control. Between the pregnancy (eating every hour so I didn't feel nauseous) and the emotional eating it's become a habit. It's not even all ""bad"" food but a lot of carb-y comfort foods and way too much chocolate and a lot of healthy food (popcorn, nuts, fruit, etc) but in excess. I drink a ton of water and tea, too. It's like I know what I need to do but I just....can't. The only thing that I think will make me feel less sad is to keep eating.

<p>I&#39;ve always been an emotional eater but this is the worst it&#39;s ever been. I REALLY don&#39;t want to start another pregnancy at a higher weight but I don&#39;t know how to get this under control. Between the pregnancy (eating every hour so I didn&#39;t feel nauseous) and the emotional eating it&#39;s become a habit. It&#39;s not even all &quot;bad&quot; food but a lot of carb-y comfort foods and way too much chocolate and a lot of healthy food (popcorn, nuts, fruit, etc) but in excess. I drink a ton of water and tea, too. It&#39;s like I know what I need to do but I just....can&#39;t. The only thing that I think will make me feel less sad is to keep eating. </p>

110,2048,confidence,<praw.reddit.Reddit object at 0x7f12a630cd90>,,ttcafterloss,"Hello everyone. I recently miscarried at 5 weeks 4 days. It started last Thursday evening and it's still going on today although today is the first day that the blood is brown instead of saturated red. I've been to my OB today who did an ultrasound and said that the miscarriage is complete and everything seemed to be expelled properly (except corpus luteum which she saw in/around my ovary and she said that would disappear on its own). I was referred to this sub by some wonderful and supportive ladies from TFAB. Ever since it happened I've been haunted by irrational questions like why did it happen? Was it the sex that morning? Was it because I started taking whey protein two days before? Was it because I didn't eat well that day? I know these are all irrational and that the answer is clear: it was bound to happen, nothing to be done about it. My OB today said that this was already determined at the moment the egg met sperm and there was nothing to do. She also said every woman experiences at least one miscarriage (it definitely sounds like a gross generalization but that's what she said).

I finally have some practical questions that I thought maybe you can help me with:

1. Ever since I got a BFP the lines have been very faint. The first faint squinter was on DPO12 and while the lines did darken over time they always remained rather faint. For instance the last one I took on DPO 18 or 19 was definitely visible (no longer a squinter) but it was definitely not as dark as the control line. It also kept taking long for it to appear. I am now wondering if that was a telltale of an impending miscarriage. Is it? That either the embryo was never strong to begin with or that the HCG levels weren't doubling as they should? Does anyone have an answer for that?

2. Another one is about my temps. I've been continuing with FF all this time. I've noticed that since Thursday (evening that I began to MC) my temps went a bit down but still were well above the cover line. On Saturday they went just below cover line but Sunday and today (Monday) they went up again. Any idea why that is? Does it mean anything? Is it just left over progesterone? (my chart: https://fertilityfriend.com/home/68248b)

3. I also intend to start TTC right away. My OB today told me to wait until I get my period to start trying again to make sure the uterine lining is ready. However, everything I read online suggests there is no reason to wait. I guess I was just curious of your opinions on this.

4. My OB also prescribed a 3 day course of antibiotics to prevent a possible infection. Anyone ever heard of that? I don't plan on taking them because I'm not sure 'preventive measure' is a good enough reason. I don't want to overwhelm my body with medications now. 

EDIT add 5: My cervix is still pretty high up. Not at all like during a period. Is there any reason for it or does it mean anything? Or is it because things are still messed up down there?

Last May, me and my boyfriend at the time found out we were pregnant. We weren't trying so we were a little shaken up by this surprise. We were so scared but after a couple days I was able to get excited. Being a mother was everything I wanted ever since I remember. Everyone I know knows how I longed to be a mother, so to have this blessing with the love of my life was a dream come true. We got married a few months after with close friends and family but the best part was having our daughter inside me growing when we got married. The day we got married was flawless...no drama, no stress, just celebration and love. My husband and I have known each other since Kindergarten, best friends since high school and have been boyfriend and girlfriend for 5 years. He's my everything. He's my strength, best friend, makes me feel safe and confident. We were so excited to be a little family. My pregnancy was a smooth one with good doctor appointments, normal lab readings and I loved feeling our little girl moving and rolling in me. As my belly grew, the more we began to prepare for her. I loved being pregnant and looking at the mirror at awe of my belly. I loved being asked how I was doing at work and people wanting to feel my belly. I was so proud of our baby when she would kick back when friends and family would rub my belly. I was so proud. Last weekend, we went out to get a Christmas tree and I got stockings for us...thats the last time I felt her kick. I remember her kicking me and telling her dad how good of a kicker she was. We daydreamed about her playing soccer and hula dancing...never in my life did I think what would happen that Monday would happen. I knew something wasnt right Monday morning when I woke up for work and I woke up my husband immediately. We sped to the ER and that's when we heard the worst news anyone could ever hear. They couldn't find her heart beat. I remember screaming WHAT?! because how is that possible?! I just had an appointment that went great the week before. I was 32 weeks along and I only had 8 weeks left..how is this possible?! I had my baby shower coming up..everyone knew I was pregnant.
My doctor sent me home with some medication to start labor and it was the most agonizing thing I've ever had to go thru. Just waiting with my family surrounding me to deliver our baby sleeping.
At first my husband and I weren't sure if we wanted to see our baby at first. But after a fast delivery, I just wanted to hold her. We held her, lover her, took pictures of her all day and I felt complete for that time. I felt like I had my family together like how I've dreamed of it all my life. The moment we had to say good bye reality sank in...it especially sank in when we left the hospital without a baby. All we had was a teddy bear and a memory box with her foot prints, measurements and a lock of hair. Our daughter had a lot of hair..just like her mom and dad. I'll always remember seeing my husband with her. How he looked at her with love in his eyes and how he cupped her little head with his big hands. Again, it was something i've always dreamed of.
Now, that we're home and recovering..I'm still searching for answers, I'm going thru my whole pregnancy where I could go wrong. I feel so mad because my milk has come and I dont have my baby to feed. I miss being happy. I'm scared to move on with life..i'm scared to see coworkers and friends with their sorry faces looking at me or when I bump into someone who doesn't know and I have to explain to them what happened. I'm just scared.
I pray that our baby is in heaven looking down on me and her daddy. I pray that she's with her family and that they are taking care of her. I pray that I have the strength to carry on with her memory...to build up enough strength to try again and have a sibling for our daughter. I pray that she hand picks that baby and looks out for all of us. I miss her so much....She's brought so much happiness and joy to me and her dad and for that I thank her.

My pregnancy was a smooth one with good doctor appointments, normal lab readings and I loved feeling our little girl moving and rolling in me. As my belly grew, the more we began to prepare for her. I loved being pregnant and looking at the mirror at awe of my belly. I loved being asked how I was doing at work and people wanting to feel my belly. I was so proud of our baby when she would kick back when friends and family would rub my belly. I was so proud. Last weekend, we went out to get a Christmas tree and I got stockings for us...thats the last time I felt her kick. I remember her kicking me and telling her dad how good of a kicker she was. We daydreamed about her playing soccer and hula dancing...never in my life did I think what would happen that Monday would happen. I knew something wasnt right Monday morning when I woke up for work and I woke up my husband immediately. We sped to the ER and that&#39;s when we heard the worst news anyone could ever hear. They couldn&#39;t find her heart beat. I remember screaming WHAT?! because how is that possible?! I just had an appointment that went great the week before. I was 32 weeks along and I only had 8 weeks left..how is this possible?! I had my baby shower coming up..everyone knew I was pregnant.
My doctor sent me home with some medication to start labor and it was the most agonizing thing I&#39;ve ever had to go thru. Just waiting with my family surrounding me to deliver our baby sleeping.
At first my husband and I weren&#39;t sure if we wanted to see our baby at first. But after a fast delivery, I just wanted to hold her. We held her, lover her, took pictures of her all day and I felt complete for that time. I felt like I had my family together like how I&#39;ve dreamed of it all my life. The moment we had to say good bye reality sank in...it especially sank in when we left the hospital without a baby. All we had was a teddy bear and a memory box with her foot prints, measurements and a lock of hair. Our daughter had a lot of hair..just like her mom and dad. I&#39;ll always remember seeing my husband with her. How he looked at her with love in his eyes and how he cupped her little head with his big hands. Again, it was something i&#39;ve always dreamed of.
Now, that we&#39;re home and recovering..I&#39;m still searching for answers, I&#39;m going thru my whole pregnancy where I could go wrong. I feel so mad because my milk has come and I dont have my baby to feed. I miss being happy. I&#39;m scared to move on with life..i&#39;m scared to see coworkers and friends with their sorry faces looking at me or when I bump into someone who doesn&#39;t know and I have to explain to them what happened. I&#39;m just scared.
I pray that our baby is in heaven looking down on me and her daddy. I pray that she&#39;s with her family and that they are taking care of her. I pray that I have the strength to carry on with her memory...to build up enough strength to try again and have a sibling for our daughter. I pray that she hand picks that baby and looks out for all of us. I miss her so much....She&#39;s brought so much happiness and joy to me and her dad and for that I thank her. Thank you baby for letting me be your mommy.</p>

Your stories have helped me so much. I have trouble crying over my own problems and it helped me to first cry over yours. 

My doctor found an abnormality that made my fetus incompatible with life. I could have waited to see what, exactly, was going to cause its death, waited for it to die on its own, or I could terminate. As I have a history with depression, I opted to terminate. To reiterate, the pregnancy was definitely doomed, my perinatologist just said if I wanted to find out what specifically was dooming it, I could wait. 

I had the procedure two weeks ago. I was lucky to find a wonderful and caring clinic and have nothing but positive things to say about them. My own doctors were also terrific. I'm healing both physically and emotionally. I know I have done the right thing. 

So why am I so angry?

The clinic was out of state. I had to drive four and a half hours to the next state, where I know no one, and stay in a hotel. All because the narrow minded, fossilized dick cheeses who run my piece of shit red state all but banned abort!on here. The only clinic left standing has a four week wait list and bullet proof glass to keep out assassins. 

The procedure was the same many of you have undergone for missed miscarriages. My perinatologist, whom I trust and like, was perfectly capable of doing it. But she couldn't, because the fetus still had a heartbeat. So I had to drive to the next state in order to terminate the pregnancy I had desperately wanted. I had to walk past evil zealot protestors. I had to pay out of pocket for a simple medical procedure, since I am a state employee and my insurance doesn't cover it. 

This past week, another dick cheese state (holla Ohio) decided to pass two bills making abort!on harder. As all of you know better than anyone, these bills affect and hurt us. Not all pregnancies end the way we want them to, and it endangers us in a very real way to not have options.

You betcha that all my Trump supporting family members are getting donations to Planned Parenthood and NARAL this year for Christmas.

I'm in the middle of my 3rd loss and in the horrible what kind of loss is this limbo.  Hcg was 113 at 10-11 dpo which seemed good!  I was starting to think my spotting was implantation bleeding!  But then 3 days later (yesterday) it was 129.  So strange because my tests got noticeably darker (frer almost equal to control line) the day before the 2nd draw.  But maybe they rose and then started falling in that time, cool 😕.  

On the one hand, this is extra shitty cause today is the anniversary of my first d and c and Sunday is my second due date anniversary, so I was hoping to hang on to hope for this pregnancy at least till Monday cause that's as far as I could imagine it when I found out.  That's messed up- but hoping for 40 weeks seemed unreasonable.  On the other hand, yesterday's phone call gave me some relief from the horrible anxiety I've had all week since I first got a positive.   I was so caught off guard by how hard it was to be hopeful.  

Now I'm terrified this is ectopic because I don't want to wait to try anymore.  I want a normal chemical so I can bleed and get on with my life, but my numbers seem a little high for that? And that has its own set of concerns, is this related to my surgery?  Are things worse down there so instead of allowing crappy implantation that limps along for 12 weeks I now can't implant at all?  Or am I just stupid for testing at 8-9 dpo and this is one of the 50% that don't make it to 4 weeks and it's all totally unrelated to my history. 

I'm also pissed because I have to continue my progesterone suppositories till Monday and wait for another blood draw.  AF is due this weekend so I'd rather just not sustain anything nonviable and get on with the next cycle.  And also, it's fucking Christmas!!!  I have a million plans this weekend, luckily mostly with my friends without kids.  Maybe I'll have a drink, fuck it.   

Anyways, sorry for the word vomit but I haven't been able to post much this week out of anxiety and not feeling like a true alumn.  If anyone has thoughts about my hcg levels, would love to hear it.  Or advice about getting ectopics diagnosed.  Thank you all for this space to vent; my husband is pretty over the obsessing at this point and I haven't even told anyone else.  🐀💔💩

I guess that I can finally introduce myself. 27 year old, currently in the process of (trigger) MC. I had a CP over Christmas last year, and this year had my BFP on Thanksgiving, only to find out today that I am either going to MC or in the process of MC. I was about 5w5d today- had a beta hcg today that showed 661, down from my 1308 on Wednesday. I've been spotting for a week, which is why I had repeat betas drawn. I'm just wondering what to expect at this point, in regards to when I am going to have the bleeding and cramps to look forward to :( I'm sorry to ask you ladies about your experience or for information about this, but I feel as if I don't know who to ask at this point.

I went in and they asked me why I'm here, I told them I had some pregnancy related questions since we are trying again and would like to know if there was any way for them to handle things differently or if I could get a referral to see someone outside of the hospital. 
The nurse asks me, ""so fertility? How long have you been trying? Me- ""two months"" Nurse-""that's not a fertility problem"" me-"" I know that, and I'm not here about fertility issues, I'm here to ask how I can stay pregnant"" 
So she asks ""so you were pregnant before"" Me-""yes..."" her ""was it just a miscarriage?"" Me ""yes a late term miscarriage, though it doesn't matter when it happens, it happen"" 

So she leaves and she said okay I'll get the doctor, mind you I'm only seeing her because I need to get a referral to speak to an OBGYN. Anyways I tell the PCM my whole story about ruptured membrane, chorioamniostisis, etc. and it seems like she didn't even read my folder previously, and I've seen her like 4 times and somehow it's the same stupid questions. 
Anyways, so it comes to the anxiety part ""I can give you medication"" no if I wanted medication I would ask you just give me meds, so that was just an annoying conversation, so finally got a referral to behavioral health. Then I ask her about my migraine , she responds with how that needs to be a different appointment. Mind you I've only been talking to her for less than 10 minutes now. So I smile and not try to lose my shit, and leave the room. 
I just can't with this hospital anymore. From misdiagnosis of GD to just the horrible bed side manner.
