I'm currently living with my boyfriend of a year and a half, we both go to college so marriage isn't quite in the picture yet. We only attend community college so we have a lot of free time and flexible schedules, so we aren't worried about a child conflicting with our education too much. I conceived in November and missed my period December, but tested just after Christmas and got a BFP. Right after telling my mom I went into the ER because I was bleeding and they just said I had a UTI, prescribed me antibiotics and sent me home saying I had a healthy 7.3 week old fetus. On January 22nd, right after telling all my family and facebook friends, I was cooking and a gush of brown blood came down my legs. I called to see if I should come in because at my first midwife appointment they schedule a second ultrasound because I had this type of minor bleeding that showed up in my ultrasound. They said to come in ASAP to do a ultrasound and they told us the growing stopped at about 7.7 weeks, go figure, right after my first ultrasound. My SO and I were devastated but I took it way harder than him. I'm still struggling to get through the days. After two weeks I've gone from 400hcg to 40hcg. I *hope*I ovulated but probably not. Now we are just waiting to either test or my period. So that's where I am right now. Thank you for reading

It's a condition that will likely make me lose every pregnancy, so I'm getting a transabdominal cerclage in three weeks to permanently close my cervix with a band around the bottom (leaving a small hole for a period, IVF, D&C, etc). I'm nervous about it because it's major surgery, similar to a C-section, and it'll mean I'll have to have a C-section if I ever get pregnant again. I'll start a new IVF cycle a month after the cerclage surgery.

<p>I&#39;m probably going to be too busy tomorrow and Monday to implement anything, so I&#39;m going to leave this poll up as a sticky post until I get back on February 14th or 15th (that means the daily TTC thread won&#39;t be sticky anymore, so you might have to search for it). I know it&#39;s a long time, but hopefully that&#39;ll give everyone a chance to take the survey. Once I get back, I&#39;ll tally the results and make a new post about the results.</p>

<p>Thanks everyone!</p>

For some reason, I had this terrible feeling from the day I got my bfp. I always felt like something was wrong. Two days after the mc started my husband deployed so ttc was put on hold. When he got back, we decided to stop ttc and try to become more financially stable and enjoy being young and married. We recently felt that now is the time to start trying again.

 I am so ready to start our family, but I am terrified of another loss. Even though I only knew I was pregnant for a week, I took the CP very hard. This time, I am going to try to just have faith and enjoy every day that I am pregnant, if and when it happens again, without letting worry cloud every thought. Easier said than done, I'm sure.

So here are the updates.  First of all, every one of you couldn't think of a good reason why it could cause actual harm to a floating egg, so thanks for that.  I do recognize that it is stressful on the body overall though, and there is always a risk of infection, so proper care is extra, extra important.

My RE responded (via the nurse), and said this:

>I reviewed your concerns with Dr. M and she verified that she does NOT recommend getting a tattoo during treatment. She said the concern is disease transmission and if a disease is contracted or a flare-up occurs during pregnancy, there would be negative outcomes for both you and the baby. Her recommendation is to wait until after you've delivered before getting a tattoo.

So, honestly, this reads like a legal boilerplate recommendation.  She cannot acknowledge that it's entirely safe and since it's their job to get me pregnant and deliver a healthy baby, they HAVE to tell me they don't recommend it.  I will note though that she used the words ""recommend"" and ""recommendation"" in lieu of harsher, more absolute terms.

So then I decided to ask my acupuncturist.   She *only* does infertility acupuncture, and so she definitely is completely, acutely aware of the same pregnancy goals and all the medical stuff that goes into that.  In fact, she loves my RE and my RE recommends her as an acupuncturist.  I included the RE's response to her, and explained everything.  I also told her I understood that she couldn't legally give me her professional opinion, and I was just asking her personal opinion.  Here is her response:

>Personally, I don’t think tattoos are really risky nowadays at a clean, good shop so I wouldn’t think twice about it if it were me. I know they are CYA in terms of their answer and I had a patient whose donor had to cancel in the middle of IVF at this clinic because the donor (who was stimming) got a recent piercing and they saw it! So I think that’s their policy. Anyway, if it were me, I’d just go for it, but I am not giving you official medical advice. I don’t think there is really a risk from the ink or anything (like toxicity) in pregnancy, right? I’m just not too sure. But I am certain they are kind of paranoid about the tattoo thing. Let me know what you decide. I want to see what you get too!

Ok, that brings us to an actual decision.

I don't have one right now.  I am honestly leaning toward finishing out my progesterone and then having a natural cycle.  The reality is that we did get pregnant once on a natural cycle, so it's not like without medicine our chances are zero.  And really right now there are two conflicting goals: 1) tattoo and 2) pregnant.  If I choose in favor of the tattoo, there is a 100% chance I will succeed.  If I choose in favor of a medicated cycle, there is a 10% chance of pregnancy, probably, at best.  I've been going after this since July 2013 and only achieved one pregnancy ever.  

The reason why I am leaning against doing a medicated cycle and then going through with the tattoo is two-fold:  First, I will highly likely ovulate much later naturally (I was usually irregular but centered around CD 17-20ish), and that will help further put us in the clear from this tattoo appointment as well as push us out of the travel red zone I have lined up for the following cycle.  I don't believe that the tattoo process would harm anything if done just after ovulation, but I would probably sleep better if it was before it.  Second, I do want to respect my RE and don't want to blatantly go against what she said.  If this is what they say, then I shouldn't be an asshole patient who completely ignores their terms.

All that said, I will talk with my husband about this extensively this weekend, because he should get a say in all this.  We're a team and collectively we're trying to get pregnant, so he gets a vote too.

I have mentioned here that I have an appointment coming up to get a memorial tattoo for my pregnancy that I lost. It's linework only, no color, and will be on my right side.

Ok, so looking at timing now, my appointment is right around ovulation for this coming cycle. I had hoped that it would be more in the time between AF and ovulation, but looks like that's not the case. In fact it will either be right on ovulation or 2-3 days after.
I've done a lot of reading online, and obviously I'm going to a reputable artist with zero risk of HIV or Hepatitis or other ridiculous things that don't occur anymore in licensed and very clean tattoo shops. This isn't some dude's garage.

The only remote thing I can find that would be a risk is that they don't have any studies done on the effect of ink on a fetus, so no promises that it's 100% safe. Well that said, if I'm getting this done before the egg even implants, could that really be a concern? I've read anecdotal stuff online and lots of people have gotten tattoos while TTC or even before knowing they were pregnant, even during pregnancy, and they all seem fine. And this isn't anywhere near the actual presence of a fetus - just an egg. But is the egg even more vulnerable and I should just reschedule?

The concern is that her schedule is packed tight. She's scheduling 6-8 weeks out at the earliest, and so I run the risk yet again of running into poor scheduling. She's highly in demand so I am worried about rescheduling too many times and putting her off.

I'm so torn. On one hand, I may not get pregnant anyway. Heck, 16 months to get pregnant the first time, and my first medicated post-MC was a bust. So I'll be annoyed if I put this off and am not pregnant either. But on the other hand, if I got pregnant, would I always be worried about it having impacted something?

Honest opinions totally welcome.

Edit: I definitely will ask my RE about this specific instance.  The one time a couple months ago I asked my nurse about it, she basically brushed it off and said not to do it because of the risk of contracting HIV or hepatitis.  Which is bonkers if you go anywhere reputable and clean as opposed to some dude's garage.  So I didn't take that advice as the actual opinion of my RE.  I just wrote my RE about this specific timing and appointment and will report back what she says.  I was just trying to get general consensus thoughts since as much research as I am doing on it, can't find a reason why this would be risky to the actual fertilized egg, especially before implantation.

Edit 2: Response from the RE is frustrating!  
>I reviewed your concerns with Dr. M and she verified that she does NOT recommend getting a tattoo during treatment. She said the concern is disease transmission and if a disease is contracted or a flare-up occurs during pregnancy, there would be negative outcomes for both you and the baby.

Warning, descriptors of my losses below.

I have a gorgeous 2 year old son who was supposed to be a twin.  We had a threatened miscarriage at 6 weeks, when they discovered I was pregnant with twins.  This was my first pregnancy, so we quite foolishly told ourselves double or nothing.  Looking back, I now know exactly when I miscarried my baby - in the OB's office of all places, at 7 weeks.  But it was a total shock for us to only see one baby at the 8-week ultrasound.  We asked the tech about the other baby, and she said, what baby?  We had a vanishing twin.  Hard to grieve a loss while we had another child to celebrate.  And people say some unfortunate things in an attempt to be helpful.  The pregnancy was rocky throughout, but by some miracle I carried him to term.

We were not trying for our second pregnancy.  It had taken us 14 months with our first and one episode of indiscretion with our second!  But we had been discussing a second child, and when we found out, we were happy, despite the financial piece.  This was the opportunity for our more joyful pregnancy.  A minor medical issue related to the pregnancy had me in the ER at 5.5 weeks with an extremely reassuring bedside ultrasound.  Then my son and husband contacted a virus, hand-foot-and-mouth disease, when I was 6 weeks along.  We tried to limit my exposure - but that was the beginning of the end, though we did not know if at the time.

At our midwife appointment at nine weeks, everything looked ""great "", though we were unable to hear the heartbeat on the Doppler (your baby is hiding being your pubic bone, don't worry at all).  HCG level was 15,000+ - perfect.  The following evening, my son and I headed across the country for the holidays - my husband was to join us in a little over a day.  The one day we were apart was the day I found out I had a missed miscarriage - the baby arrested at 6.5 weeks, probably because of the HFMD.  A week later, the day after Christmas, I miscarried.  10 days later, I passed the rest.  Because I was in a different state, I couldn't even get OB follow-up until after the whole ordeal was over.

A little history of us: We are both 25 years old (I'm turning 26 in 2-3 months). I have PCOS and long cycles (unmedicated they varied between 35 and 98 days, medicated 30-40 days) We had been trying since Jan '14 and succeded on our 2nd clomid cycle last November. 

We found out last Thursday in our 12 week US that the baby had not developed more than 6-7 weeks. We had experienced a missed miscarriage. It's crushing to know that for all those happy weeks we believed we were expecting, we planned and looked at names, we already know what changing table to buy, I was thinking of how to announce it to my friends this weekend. 

The doctors expect a partial-molar pregnancy but we won't know for sure until we get the test results back. If it turns out to be a PMP we won't be able to try for quite a while. If it turns out to be just a regular miscarriage (athough what the hell is regular about this...) we may start trying again soon. 

How soon I don't know as I've heard so many versions. We were told in the regular cases we should wait for at least 2-3 cycles. With my endless cycles I don't even know how long that is... We want to start trying as soon as we can. We have talked a lot about this experience, our ttc and future plans. And the answer is always that we want to start TTC again. We feel like we need to. This limbo is killing me, and it's not even been a week...

I wanted to ask those of you who have long and irregular cycles how long it took for your period to come back? And did it get extra irregular? I know this has been asked like a thousand times but I always here answers like it will be 2-4 weeks delayed. What if my periods are ALWAYS 2-4 weeks delayed? Do they come at my body's ""normal time"" or are they delayed even further? What about ovulation? I sometimes ovulate and sometimes not. Can I expect not to for the first cycles?

If you use a generic name (like we just had someone enter with the username ""Visitor""), you're likely to get booted just because we don't want trolls amongst us giving anyone grief or making anyone's day bad.

Along those lines, if you're in the room and need to kick someone out, type ""/kick username"" (of course with their actual username and without the quotes) and they'll be kicked out.  I don't foresee the need to do this often, but I wanted you to know how to in case you need to.

Let's talk music today.  Who are some of your favorite artists?  What are some songs/artists that have special significance to you?  What's getting a lot of play on your iPod these days?  What are you singing in the car when no one's watching a la that cop who likes Taylor Swift?  Feel free to submit a song or two that's been getting you through this rough period in your life.  

I've been listening to a lot of Walk the Moon lately - ""Shut Up and Dance"" is one of the few things that seems to have been able to consistently make me smile since October.  

Ben Folds is my all-time favorite artist.  I walked up the aisle at my wedding to ""The Luckiest"" as played by two of my best friends on piano and violin.  (They recorded it for us; you can hear it here: http://www.mediafire.com/listen/brrcgwvyj6ig6cz/theluckiest.mp3) 

Ingrid Michaelson is also a perennial favorite.  Husband and I danced to ""The Way I Am"" at our wedding and if we have a ""song,"" that's it.  ""Afterlife"" has been sustaining me this month.

What are you singing in the car when no one&#39;s watching a la that cop who likes Taylor Swift?  Feel free to submit a song or two that&#39;s been getting you through this rough period in your life.  </p>

<p>I&#39;ve been listening to a lot of Walk the Moon lately - &quot;Shut Up and Dance&quot; is one of the few things that seems to have been able to consistently make me smile since October.  </p>

<p>Ben Folds is my all-time favorite artist.  I walked up the aisle at my wedding to &quot;The Luckiest&quot; as played by two of my best friends on piano and violin.  (They recorded it for us; you can hear it here: <a href=""http://www.mediafire.com/listen/brrcgwvyj6ig6cz/theluckiest.mp3"">http://www.mediafire.com/listen/brrcgwvyj6ig6cz/theluckiest.mp3</a>) </p>

<p>Ingrid Michaelson is also a perennial favorite.  Husband and I danced to &quot;The Way I Am&quot; at our wedding and if we have a &quot;song,&quot; that&#39;s it.  &quot;Afterlife&quot; has been sustaining me this month.

I very recently lost my newborn son. I posted about it in babyloss, but haven't written his birth or death story yet. He was 7 days old (5 days normal and fine). He died from bacterial meningitis caused by E. coli which somehow got into his brain at or right after birth and didn't show until one night when he started having seizures in my arms. His brain was destroyed by the infection very quickly and he could not sustain life for long without assistance. We got to say goodbye.

My husband and I have decided we want another baby. I am not looking forward to another nine months of pregnancy, as it was very rough, but it is so worth it, and I have realised that I can't ""wait until I am recovered"". 

My husband and I agreed to not prevent pregnancy. Since the birth, we have been sexual together but have not ""tried"" (need to learn the acronym for that still),  as I have been healing from an episiotomy.

I just finished my first period, and now I am a bit anxious about officially trying, as the time is now here to do so and I am all healed. I'm not sure what my reactions will be if I DO get pregnant right away, or how I will feel if it takes a while to conceive.

In theory I think I ovulated around CD 20, but the OPKs were unclear so I don't really know for sure.

<p>I&#39;m not happy or excited about this positive test, I&#39;m just scared that my body is failing me again and there is absolutely nothing I can do about it. Le sigh. </p>

<p>Edit: To correct estimated ovulation day</p>

What do you think?  I could set it up (probably) if you guys are interested?
