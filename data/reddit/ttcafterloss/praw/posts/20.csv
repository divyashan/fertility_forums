My husband and I had something of a non-traditional loss late last year. After a long, painful, multi-year attempt at adopting a child, our adoption was terminated unexpectedly and irreversibly. It was devastating. We still desperately want a family. We've been TTC since last year and we're not having any luck. We're also beginning the adoption process again, this time foster/adopt rather than international adoption due to finances. 

My family is less than sensitive. I get questions ALL. THE. TIME. about when I'm going to have a baby. Tonight, at my sister's birthday party, my brother asked me (in front of my whole family) ""So, what, do you just not want kids?"" 

I'm so angry and frustrated. I just responded ""well I won't have one for at least 9 months,"" to which my brother made some nasty comment about my and my husband's sex life. Instead of losing it, I said ""I'll let DH handle all baby related questions from now on."" and DH said he had nothing to announce, but we'd let them know if we ever do. 

This happens at least once a week. I'm very, very private, and my family is very negative (especially about adoption, but I can't even imagine what they'll say about a foster adoption situation) and I  don't want to tell them anything about our issues but I also want them to back off, and they're clearly not seeing how hurtful it is to suggest I just don't want a child. I already feel like such a failure, and I constantly think about the child we lost; their insensitivity just makes everything worse.

I don't know what I'm really looking for. Does anyone have any advice about how to shut up insensitive, ignorant people?

We found out that we were expecting a girl a little over two weeks ago in our anatomy scan. I unfortunately went in to premature labor on Monday, 2/29 late afternoon. I thought I was having braxton hicks, but after a gush of fluid and an hour or so after that of wondering if was just discharge and if I would get laughed out of the ER, I finally decided to go in after calling a 24 hr nurse line and she also thought I should go in. I was timing them and just wasn't ready yet to understand what was going on since I was only 21 weeks. My intuition had told me to pack a hospital bag the Friday before, so luckily that was ready to go with a special blanket I had sewn her. The entire pregnancy I thought that something would go wrong. I think I knew all along that something unexpectedly bad would happen. When I saw my OB a few hours after delivery she said something to the same effect. Like, you were low risk and nothing medically pointed us in that direction so we never could have known, but you knew. I was low risk for my entire pregnancy, but I insisted on going to high risk OB and doing extra testing because I thought that I would end up high risk. Once I got to triage and checked out on 2/29, they confirmed that they could see only amniotic sac, and no cervix and that they couldn't do a cerclage since I had ruptured already. My water fully broke like a huge gush just like in the movies when I was in the bathroom. The docs were amazing when they explained that she would be delivered that night, that there was a bad infection. It turns out it was a fetal infection, and I will always wonder how she got it, what I could have done (even though I know nothing deep down, etc.) They mentioned that she needed just three more weeks to be viable, but those three weeks meant everything and in this situation, there would be no NICU team to resuscitate her and that I would go through normal labor and delivery, but at the end, my baby may or may not be alive and that she would die shortly after even if she survived the birth. I got to my labor suite at about 12:30 or so and contractions started getting more intense around 2 or so. I got some IV pain meds and then an epidural which kicked in just in time. I pushed a few times, but the doc decided that we would give it time and just let her work her way out of my body. She was breech, but small so they weren't worried about me delivering vaginally. The worst parts were feeling her feet wiggling around between my legs and then I just felt her head slip out without even pushing. I just felt like I failed her.  Scarlet Elizabeth was born over four months premature at 21 weeks, weighing at 1 lb .8 oz, and measuring at 11 inches long. They said that she was a big baby for her gestational age. I knew she would be a big baby : ) She was gorgeous! Best button nose and perfect little lips. Just looked like a normal baby but tiny and asleep. Her color on her body was pretty red/purple but her face was normal color. They cleaned her up, pulled the placenta out of me (probably the worst pain of all of it), and they she died in my arms. We held her for almost nine hours after that. It was a blur. She was wrapped in the special blanket I made for her. The doc was pregnant and hugged me and walked away crying when her shift was over and it was time for her to go home. My nurses were amazing, everyone was amazing. We had her baptized. We sang to her, talked to her, kissed her all over, took pictures, laughed, cried, had a dance party, facetimed with friends and grandparents. We fit as much as we could in to the time we got to be with her body. They discharged me by noon on 3/1, so I was only at the hospital something like 16 hours. I read once on this sub that you have to hold something in your arms when leaving the hospital without a baby. I had a football hold on her special blanket I sewed for her that she had been in for the last nine hours. I held my head do high and wore my tears proudly. Nurse Deb hugged me and held me and was protective of me as she wheeled me. Hubby has been taking great care of me. My pain is minimal. Having bleeding and same recover as any vaginal delivery. Baby was small so no tearing. Doc said worst damage done to my vagina was her rooting around for placenta. Keep rubbing where my bump was, which is hard to stop doing. Don't feel much like talking to family or anyone besides my husband. My employer paid fly my mom which is nice. My husband and I take turns snuggling her blanket, are both crying, and helping each other through it. I keep having to remind myself that she isn't in the blanket since we spent so much time with her when she was wrapped up in it. I have packed away all my little girls clothes I have bought, all of the gear I bought in advance on sale, and my maternity clothes until I need them again. It was comforting receiving the last two orders from Carters that I had placed.  I made the last order on the day when I went in to labor and spent so much time picking out each thing, so it made me happy to lay her clothes out on my bed and touch each thing. I hope to be back and my husband and I look forward to taking the next several months healing, enjoying a gorgeous pacific northwest summer, kayaking, biking, swimming, and preparing our hearts for hopefully another pregnancy. My OB already has plans to pair me with a Perinatologist to plan for my next pregnancy. There's nothing I could have done differently. I am taking time to mourn Scarlet and heal, and trying not to have regrets or think about the what ifs.

I had checked out this sub before getting pregnant and have been following since we lost Scarlet. i am finding it more helpful than anything else even though we aren't ttc yet. You all give me hope and I feel so fortunate that I can consider you all my new tribe (even though it is a tribe I never imagined or wanted to be a part of). 

I am going to grief counseling, have plenty of time off work, am looking for a permanent counselor, and am focused on self care and keeping my body in good condition.  I want to look forward to my future and I am just kicking it ""What About Bob Style"" with teeny tiny baby steps every day.

I thought I was having braxton hicks, but after a gush of fluid and an hour or so after that of wondering if was just discharge and if I would get laughed out of the ER, I finally decided to go in after calling a 24 hr nurse line and she also thought I should go in. I was timing them and just wasn&#39;t ready yet to understand what was going on since I was only 21 weeks. My intuition had told me to pack a hospital bag the Friday before, so luckily that was ready to go with a special blanket I had sewn her. The entire pregnancy I thought that something would go wrong. I think I knew all along that something unexpectedly bad would happen. When I saw my OB a few hours after delivery she said something to the same effect. Like, you were low risk and nothing medically pointed us in that direction so we never could have known, but you knew. I was low risk for my entire pregnancy, but I insisted on going to high risk OB and doing extra testing because I thought that I would end up high risk. Once I got to triage and checked out on 2/29, they confirmed that they could see only amniotic sac, and no cervix and that they couldn&#39;t do a cerclage since I had ruptured already. My water fully broke like a huge gush just like in the movies when I was in the bathroom. The docs were amazing when they explained that she would be delivered that night, that there was a bad infection. It turns out it was a fetal infection, and I will always wonder how she got it, what I could have done (even though I know nothing deep down, etc.) They mentioned that she needed just three more weeks to be viable, but those three weeks meant everything and in this situation, there would be no NICU team to resuscitate her and that I would go through normal labor and delivery, but at the end, my baby may or may not be alive and that she would die shortly after even if she survived the birth. I got to my labor suite at about 12:30 or so and contractions started getting more intense around 2 or so. I got some IV pain meds and then an epidural which kicked in just in time. I pushed a few times, but the doc decided that we would give it time and just let her work her way out of my body. She was breech, but small so they weren&#39;t worried about me delivering vaginally. The worst parts were feeling her feet wiggling around between my legs and then I just felt her head slip out without even pushing. I just felt like I failed her.  Scarlet Elizabeth was born over four months premature at 21 weeks, weighing at 1 lb .8 oz, and measuring at 11 inches long. They said that she was a big baby for her gestational age. I knew she would be a big baby : ) She was gorgeous! Best button nose and perfect little lips. Just looked like a normal baby but tiny and asleep. Her color on her body was pretty red/purple but her face was normal color. They cleaned her up, pulled the placenta out of me (probably the worst pain of all of it), and they she died in my arms. We held her for almost nine hours after that. It was a blur. She was wrapped in the special blanket I made for her. The doc was pregnant and hugged me and walked away crying when her shift was over and it was time for her to go home. My nurses were amazing, everyone was amazing. We had her baptized. We sang to her, talked to her, kissed her all over, took pictures, laughed, cried, had a dance party, facetimed with friends and grandparents. We fit as much as we could in to the time we got to be with her body. They discharged me by noon on 3/1, so I was only at the hospital something like 16 hours. I read once on this sub that you have to hold something in your arms when leaving the hospital without a baby. I had a football hold on her special blanket I sewed for her that she had been in for the last nine hours. I held my head do high and wore my tears proudly. Nurse Deb hugged me and held me and was protective of me as she wheeled me. Hubby has been taking great care of me. My pain is minimal. Having bleeding and same recover as any vaginal delivery. Baby was small so no tearing. Doc said worst damage done to my vagina was her rooting around for placenta. Keep rubbing where my bump was, which is hard to stop doing. Don&#39;t feel much like talking to family or anyone besides my husband. My employer paid fly my mom which is nice. My husband and I take turns snuggling her blanket, are both crying, and helping each other through it. I keep having to remind myself that she isn&#39;t in the blanket since we spent so much time with her when she was wrapped up in it. I have packed away all my little girls clothes I have bought, all of the gear I bought in advance on sale, and my maternity clothes until I need them again. It was comforting receiving the last two orders from Carters that I had placed.  I made the last order on the day when I went in to labor and spent so much time picking out each thing, so it made me happy to lay her clothes out on my bed and touch each thing. I hope to be back and my husband and I look forward to taking the next several months healing, enjoying a gorgeous pacific northwest summer, kayaking, biking, swimming, and preparing our hearts for hopefully another pregnancy. My OB already has plans to pair me with a Perinatologist to plan for my next pregnancy. There&#39;s nothing I could have done differently. I am taking time to mourn Scarlet and heal, and trying not to have regrets or think about the what ifs.</p>

<p>I had checked out this sub before getting pregnant and have been following since we lost Scarlet. i am finding it more helpful than anything else even though we aren&#39;t ttc yet. You all give me hope and I feel so fortunate that I can consider you all my new tribe (even though it is a tribe I never imagined or wanted to be a part of). </p>

<p>I am going to grief counseling, have plenty of time off work, am looking for a permanent counselor, and am focused on self care and keeping my body in good condition.  I want to look forward to my future and I am just kicking it &quot;What About Bob Style&quot; with teeny tiny baby steps every day. </p>

<p>Lots of love to all of you. I admire you and you have all helped me already. </p>

I felt very pregnant, with all the classic symptoms of insane nausea, fatigue, etc. and had great HCG levels...just no baby.  To say it was a huge disappointment is an understatement.  My husband and I had been trying for about 8 months and were so excited to get the positive test, but I started spotting and then had the ultrasounds, and it all went downhill from there.  The doctors and nurses who handled the D&C were amazing and caring and made the experience as good as it could possibly be, but it was still a stressful experience.  Also, the ultrasounds indicated that I have a uterine anomaly, and they want to do further testing (HSG and hysteroscopy) to determine what kind of anomaly I have, so I'll be back to the hospital for that testing soon, because they want to check that out before they clear us to try again.  

All of this is to say:  I very, very much want to have children still, but this experience has been so heartbreaking and painful that I'm not sure how to mentally gear myself up to try again.  Not to mention all the time off of work that I had to take for doctor's appointments and surgery and will need to take for the uterine anomaly investigation.

My fiancé and I just found out today that our baby girl is (has?) triploidy. This is a lethal anomaly in which every chromosome is tripled. My doctors have suspected this since we got our first trimester screening results back (normal NT, extremely low PAPP-A and HCG). They attempted a CVS 2 weeks ago, but couldn't get a sample due to location of the placenta. Last Friday I had my amniocentesis (turned out to be a huge ordeal due to my retroverted uterus and tendency to vasovagal).

I cried constantly the past couple weeks, but now that I actually know I just feel so numb. I have a consultation for termination tomorrow afternoon and I think we're going to have a D&amp;E depending on what they recommend. I live in a state with moderately strict laws, so we have to wait at least 24 hours after the consultation and signing the papers and I'm going to be forced to have one last ultrasound to see the baby (and make me feel more guilty about this decision). 

I feel like I'm just a mess right now and cannot even gather my thoughts properly, but I just wanted to get this off my chest in a supportive community. 

Update: 
We have to wait until 3/16 for the procedure. 
My doctor was really amazing and is bypassing the state required ultrasound at her own risk because she doesn't want to put us through that painful experience. 
She also said we can have a chaplain come to bless the baby.

How do you get back that initial excitement after a MC? How do you let yourself be happy about a future life, while you realize that life may not actually happen for you? I know it is stupid, but it feels like talking about it made it go away. Has anyone else felt like this? </p>

When Walker was born and died we were given a bear and having something tangible to hold in those dark times was comforting and it made me feel like he mattered to the staff. I would like to offer other parents who are grieving that same comfort and the knowledge that they are not alone in their grief.

I donated two bears in honor of /u/hippopotamuscles ' s son James in November and the experience was comforting and healing.

If this is something you would like to take part in all you need to do is:

1) Purchase a new medium-sized stuffed bear. Try to choose one that is cute, but not cartoon-happy, if that makes sense. [These are the bears I donated in November for James and Walker.](http://imgur.com/YoSW9vT)

2) Make a tag for the bears. I want these to be something simple, something that will let the grieving parent know they are not alone, include a little about the baby you are remembering, whether it's Walker, your own, or any other baby you wish to buy and donate a bear for, and direct them to a place where they can talk to other parents who understand their pain. The email address I created is walkerandjamesbears@gmail.com. I have to give a nod to hippo's son James as he sparked the idea. [Here is a sample tag.](http://imgur.com/a/kpZH0) Simply attach the tag around the bear's neck with yarn.

3) Ship or deliver the bears to your local hospital's labor and delivery. I had considered having all the bears sent to the hospital where Walker was delivered, but shipping even light objects long distances could become cost-prohibitive and I really like the idea of our little babies having an impact across the globe. I also want to avoid flooding the local hospital with a number of bears that will be unwieldy and difficult to manage, as the program here is administered unofficially by nurses. If, by chance, your local hospital will not accept such a donation then I can gladly give you the address to send them to for the hospital where Walker was delivered as they will accept such a donation.

I WANT to believe I was 'successful' this time & may be pregnant, but I'm not sure. I'm having symptoms similar to when I was pregnant once before (cramping, no nausea but needing to urinate more frequently, occasional sore back, fatigue). I know similar symptoms can also show up before a period, but my BBT has been high & hasn't dipped yet. The other months in which I WASN'T pregnant definitely had my BBT dip by now (even with my PCOS/irregular periods). I'm currently 13DPO - I was 11DPO when I got a faint positive result before. I've tested the 1st morning urine a few different times over the last few days, but not even a faint positive yet (mostly one brand of testing strips, still good, but I used an early response store brand this morning & still nothing). I'm trying not to call my DR's office until I at least see a faint positive (don't want to go for nothing), but I'm getting a little more anxious every day.

Has this ever happened to anyone else? I don't want to 'jump the gun', but like I said - I already had a positive result by now the last time (I ended up miscarrying, but that's neither here nor there in this situation - I think). I WANT to be pregnant obviously, but I don't want to be setting myself up for disappointment either if I get my period in the next couple days. I figure if I don't get my period by the end of the week, I'll definitely consider calling my DR (though again - I'm trying not to w/o a faint positive b/c it's a little difficult for me to get time off of work {I work as an MA in a small DR's office})..... urgh.

&nbsp;

tl;dr of original post is that I got a BFP two weeks ago, then a lighter test the next morning, then my period; assumed early loss. A few days ago, I found out I was not only still getting positive HPTs, but they were getting darker and darker. The question: was I still pregnant?? If so, HOW?

&nbsp;

SOOO... long story short, I *was* still pregnant. I got my blood work done. HCG was 118, then just one day later, 212, and the doctor said it was a good doubling rate (27 hours, when they want 48) and the numbers looked like normal numbers for 4 weeks. BUT I would have been nearly 7 weeks at that point. She said that if I was 7 weeks my numbers wouldn't be this low, and if I'd miscarried a pregnancy that would have now been 7 weeks 2 weeks ago, my numbers wouldn't *still* be this high, and they wouldn't be increasing, either. So one way or another, my situation was bizarre. She and various nurses got my hopes up, and almost had me convinced that either I WAS somehow 4 weeks (which made no sense, the BFP before my period made me at least 6 weeks, and I would not have had time to get pregnant *again* at that point), or that, at the very least, the growth had somehow paused and then started up again, like some kind of crazy miracle, and I was going to just proceed as normal from here on out. 

&nbsp;

No such luck. Starting Wednesday I bled again, on and off, for 24 hours. Yesterday the doctor called; my 3rd HCG was only one point from the previous. So, experientially, this is my second miscarriage for the *same pregnancy*, because I lost it the day after my first BFP, thought I had it back, then lost it again yesterday. 

&nbsp;

Somehow, though, I am less sad this time around, and more relieved. I don't know how I would have handled my anxiety during the pregnancy if it had hung on a little longer, with such low numbers and such an inauspicious start, I would have just been waiting for disaster. The last few days I have been a wreck, forever in and out of hope, terror, and wishing I could just see a good sign or a bad one soon. I knew a bad sign was more likely, so I'm almost grateful. I know that sounds horrible. I just want a pregnancy that doesn't start out spelling certain doom.

<p>Also, for awhile I was like, if I don&#39;t get pregnant right away we can time it so I can be a little pregnant (1st-2nd trimester) and it wouldn&#39;t be a huge deal. But now with the news of the Zika virus, I don&#39;t know if I dare be pregnant while going to Belize. </p>

<p>I guess I&#39;m wondering, is it inevitable that if we don&#39;t get pregnant within the next 2 cycles I&#39;m doomed to have to wait until April 2017 to try again?</p>

How does one describe the daily anxiety, the nauseous feeling that sits right between my breasts, the weight that seems to creep up my throat in a strangling hold? How does one describe the depression that sits at the pit of your stomach, that comes up every time you think of pregnancy, miscarriage, or family. Anything can remind you of these things, remind you of your pregnancies and losses. 
One miscarriage makes you feel horrible, lost, confused, alone. By the fourth you're just numb. Oh sure you're still excited every time you see that positive test, can't help but dream of the life you will have... But it becomes just another number. 4th pregnancy, week 6, 4th miscarriage, bleed 5 days, no period for 6 weeks. All just numbers. 
And the idea that, after adding up all the pregnancies and how far along each was... the idea that had it been one pregnancy... I could have known if it was a boy or a girl. Had it been one pregnancy, my baby would be x days/weeks/months/years old. 
But how do you describe these feelings? How do you explain to someone who has never been through it, what it feels like when you see your friends or family, pregnant or with a new baby. That every time someone asks ""when are you going to try?"", as if you weren't trying already! That every time someone asks, it tears your heart a little but more. You see women happily pregnant, or worse, not wanting to be pregnant, and you die a little more inside because you so badly want that to be you.
How can all that be explained? The grief never leaves. It's a weight you carry with you, always. People will say, just don't remember that... don't remember that on this day, a year, or two ago, I lost my 1st, 2nd, 3rd baby... How can I forget?! Those were the days my world crashed around me... the days a portion of my dreams died. I want so much to be blind to the dates, oblivious to the amount of time that has passed that I have gone without that wonderful baby in my tummy, my arms... my life. If there was an amnesia pill, would I take it? Probably not, the pain would still be there. 
I go on living with this pain. I am told I have a bad attitude...I'm called negative. But this is who I am. Every loss has turned me into the person I am today. I am not afraid to speak of my losses, but I don't say how much each loss hurt. The person who I am is not perfect, but crawling through life just waiting for the storm to pass... waiting for my rainbow.  If that makes me a bad person, so be it. You don't even know. Hell, Half the time even I don't know. 
And that's where I am today. Waiting for a consult that will tell me what my future will hold. How much longer I will be kept in limbo. 
So here I sit with anxiety wrapped around my throat, depression sitting at the pit of my stomach, my mind a whirl of activity as I go from possibility to possibility...

Why Bill 141 Matters
By: Jamie McCleary 

The loss of a child, in any stage of life is quite possibly the most difficult event any parent will ever experience.  Whether the child is five, forty, or yet to be born, there is no period of time in which a parent’s love for their child isn’t all encompassing-and entirely decimating to lose.  It’s difficult to explain to someone who has never experienced the loss of an infant or of an unborn baby, just how affected we are by the loss of our babies.  Parents are met with comments like, “you should be glad it happened before they were born, and you got attached,” or “you can always have more,” or “at least you have a child at home already.”  What people outside of this special loss community fail to understand is that a positive pregnancy test brings with it an imagined life, entirely lived in our heads as we picture who that baby will be, who will they look like, will it finally be a little boy in the family, and just about any other aspect of a new life that can be considered.  In those first few minutes of known existence, a mother will be picturing that child graduating from college, or becoming a doctor or lawyer.  She will have dreamed of every insignificant thing she wants to teach her baby, every activity she wants to undertake with her son or daughter, and every hope and dream she will ever have for that little life she has just discovered living inside her.  From that point on, the bond simply continues to grow as she begins to learn her child’s personality, and there is definitely a little personality being developed and learned from very early on.  Every kick is a communication between mother and child, every hiccup is an opportunity for the expectant mother to coddle her baby, trying to soothe those hiccups away so her baby can sleep.  Every pain, ache, tear, moment of nausea and sleepless night that comes with pregnancy, is endured for the promise of a beautiful little person as a reward at the end of the journey.  Every day that baby is carried and nurtured inside his or her mother’s body, is another day for the expectant mother to fall a little bit more in love with this amazing person she is growing. 

With the death of that child, at any point in pregnancy, not only comes the loss of that child, but the loss of every dream a mother or father has had for that child.  Every imagined scenario in that child’s life becomes a loss, the space that would have been the baby’s is a gaping hole in their home, a constant reminder of the life they will never live. In many ways, the loss of those dreams is worse than the loss of a person already having been a part of someone’s life.  When a friend or family member dies, we mourn the loss of their presence, we miss the things we used to experience with them, we mourn the place they held in our lives.  With the loss of a child or an unborn baby, we are left with endless questions and no concrete idea of what we will be grieving.  Every period of time that passes, the grief evolves into something new.  Would that baby have been anything like our neighbour’s five year old daughter, if she had survived?  Would he be playing on the baseball team with his older brother?  What would he look like today?  How different would our lives be, if our babies were still here?  Even the experiences we take most for granted, like remembering someone’s eyes, or the sound of their voice, are mourned, for those parents who never experienced their child alive, outside Mom’s body. 

As a result of those intense feelings of grief and loss, and the lack of understanding from the world around grieving parents, the isolation, devastation, and helplessness they experience, is incredibly difficult to work through without the structure of support that is unique to pregnancy and infant loss.  The comments by friends and family that are meant to comfort and soothe, feel abrasive, and hurtful.  It’s impossible to understand what it is a grieving parent needs to hear unless it’s experienced firsthand, or an attempt to learn what can be done for them is made.  No parent is ever the same again after experiencing the loss of a child.  A new pregnancy is met with fear, and the belief of another inevitable death, no matter how unlikely it may be.  Never again will she start a baby registry in her first trimester.  She may avoid joining prenatal groups or classes, may choose not to tell anyone about their new baby until late into the pregnancy, may not look at names until the baby is born, and may not buy a single item for that baby, until they bring him or her home.  The naïve joy that the parents, unaffected by pregnancy and infant loss have is lost to those that will never forget the child they will never know.

One in four pregnancies will end in loss, statistically speaking.  Twenty five percent of unborn children will die.  An immense number of families will be forced to grieve the loss of their child during pregnancy, birth or the first year of life.  And yet, Ontarians as a population, are still relatively uninformed and naïve when it comes to pregnancy and infant loss and the repercussions it has on Ontario families.  That will change soon.

December 8th, 2016, in Toronto, Ontario, marked a historic day in Canadian history. Bill 141, also known as the Pregnancy and Infant Loss Awareness, Research and Care Act, was enacted into provincial legislation making Ontario the first Canadian province to recognize pregnancy and infant loss as a national issue to be addressed.

Bill 141, introduced to parliament by Lawrence-Eglington MPP Mike Colle, seeks to develop research into the causes of pregnancy and infant loss, in the hopes of eliminating the factors that may play a part.  Initially, the bill also sought to develop specialized programs within hospitals, to accommodate families experiencing pregnancy loss or still birth; creating areas to deliver deceased babies in a positive and nurturing environment, with staff fully trained to meet the needs of bereaved parents, as well as funding and directing families to support programs, such as the Pregnancy and Infant Loss Network, or PAIL.  The bill has been amended to be incorporated into the current Ministry of Health and Long Term Care Act, but what that means for the bill itself isn’t quite clear.  The final victory achieved by the baby loss community is the official recognition in Ontario of Pregnancy and Infant Loss Awareness Day on October 15th and the hope that awareness can be spread throughout the province on the frequency of baby loss, as well as the understanding of the specialized grief and needs of those families affected. 

As a volunteer for the PAIL network, I am familiar with the importance this organization plays in the healing process of parents of who have experienced loss.  PAIL offers support groups that meet once or twice a month led by trained facilitators who themselves are bereaved parents.

<p>Why Bill 141 Matters
By: Jamie McCleary </p>

<p>The loss of a child, in any stage of life is quite possibly the most difficult event any parent will ever experience.  Whether the child is five, forty, or yet to be born, there is no period of time in which a parent’s love for their child isn’t all encompassing-and entirely decimating to lose.  It’s difficult to explain to someone who has never experienced the loss of an infant or of an unborn baby, just how affected we are by the loss of our babies.  Parents are met with comments like, “you should be glad it happened before they were born, and you got attached,” or “you can always have more,” or “at least you have a child at home already.”  What people outside of this special loss community fail to understand is that a positive pregnancy test brings with it an imagined life, entirely lived in our heads as we picture who that baby will be, who will they look like, will it finally be a little boy in the family, and just about any other aspect of a new life that can be considered.  In those first few minutes of known existence, a mother will be picturing that child graduating from college, or becoming a doctor or lawyer.  She will have dreamed of every insignificant thing she wants to teach her baby, every activity she wants to undertake with her son or daughter, and every hope and dream she will ever have for that little life she has just discovered living inside her.  From that point on, the bond simply continues to grow as she begins to learn her child’s personality, and there is definitely a little personality being developed and learned from very early on.  Every kick is a communication between mother and child, every hiccup is an opportunity for the expectant mother to coddle her baby, trying to soothe those hiccups away so her baby can sleep.  Every pain, ache, tear, moment of nausea and sleepless night that comes with pregnancy, is endured for the promise of a beautiful little person as a reward at the end of the journey.  Every day that baby is carried and nurtured inside his or her mother’s body, is another day for the expectant mother to fall a little bit more in love with this amazing person she is growing. </p>

<p>With the death of that child, at any point in pregnancy, not only comes the loss of that child, but the loss of every dream a mother or father has had for that child.  Every imagined scenario in that child’s life becomes a loss, the space that would have been the baby’s is a gaping hole in their home, a constant reminder of the life they will never live. In many ways, the loss of those dreams is worse than the loss of a person already having been a part of someone’s life.  When a friend or family member dies, we mourn the loss of their presence, we miss the things we used to experience with them, we mourn the place they held in our lives.  With the loss of a child or an unborn baby, we are left with endless questions and no concrete idea of what we will be grieving.  Every period of time that passes, the grief evolves into something new.  Would that baby have been anything like our neighbour’s five year old daughter, if she had survived?  Would he be playing on the baseball team with his older brother?  What would he look like today?  How different would our lives be, if our babies were still here?  Even the experiences we take most for granted, like remembering someone’s eyes, or the sound of their voice, are mourned, for those parents who never experienced their child alive, outside Mom’s body. </p>

<p>As a result of those intense feelings of grief and loss, and the lack of understanding from the world around grieving parents, the isolation, devastation, and helplessness they experience, is incredibly difficult to work through without the structure of support that is unique to pregnancy and infant loss.  The comments by friends and family that are meant to comfort and soothe, feel abrasive, and hurtful.  It’s impossible to understand what it is a grieving parent needs to hear unless it’s experienced firsthand, or an attempt to learn what can be done for them is made.  No parent is ever the same again after experiencing the loss of a child.  A new pregnancy is met with fear, and the belief of another inevitable death, no matter how unlikely it may be.  Never again will she start a baby registry in her first trimester.  She may avoid joining prenatal groups or classes, may choose not to tell anyone about their new baby until late into the pregnancy, may not look at names until the baby is born, and may not buy a single item for that baby, until they bring him or her home.  The naïve joy that the parents, unaffected by pregnancy and infant loss have is lost to those that will never forget the child they will never know.</p>

<p>One in four pregnancies will end in loss, statistically speaking.  Twenty five percent of unborn children will die.  An immense number of families will be forced to grieve the loss of their child during pregnancy, birth or the first year of life.  And yet, Ontarians as a population, are still relatively uninformed and naïve when it comes to pregnancy and infant loss and the repercussions it has on Ontario families.  That will change soon.</p>

<p>December 8th, 2016, in Toronto, Ontario, marked a historic day in Canadian history. Bill 141, also known as the Pregnancy and Infant Loss Awareness, Research and Care Act, was enacted into provincial legislation making Ontario the first Canadian province to recognize pregnancy and infant loss as a national issue to be addressed.</p>

<p>Bill 141, introduced to parliament by Lawrence-Eglington MPP Mike Colle, seeks to develop research into the causes of pregnancy and infant loss, in the hopes of eliminating the factors that may play a part.  Initially, the bill also sought to develop specialized programs within hospitals, to accommodate families experiencing pregnancy loss or still birth; creating areas to deliver deceased babies in a positive and nurturing environment, with staff fully trained to meet the needs of bereaved parents, as well as funding and directing families to support programs, such as the Pregnancy and Infant Loss Network, or PAIL.  The bill has been amended to be incorporated into the current Ministry of Health and Long Term Care Act, but what that means for the bill itself isn’t quite clear.  The final victory achieved by the baby loss community is the official recognition in Ontario of Pregnancy and Infant Loss Awareness Day on October 15th and the hope that awareness can be spread throughout the province on the frequency of baby loss, as well as the understanding of the specialized grief and needs of those families affected. </p>

<p>As a volunteer for the PAIL network, I am familiar with the importance this organization plays in the healing process of parents of who have experienced loss.  PAIL offers support groups that meet once or twice a month led by trained facilitators who themselves are bereaved parents.  These groups allow the newly bereaved a place to speak about their babies in a place where they can feel safe, and understood.  They can hear the stories of people just like them, to learn that they are not alone in the strange and sometimes terrifying feelings they are experiencing, and that their own unique grief process is perfectly normal and natural. PAIL also offers one to one telephone support, again with trained volunteers, also bereaved parents, to those who prefer a more private setting to speak, or who are not located near a support group.  As a result of the passing and publicity of Bill 141, the amount of bereaved parents, being introduced to the PAIL network for the first time, is staggering. The intake for the month of December alone, has increased by over 400 %, leaving staff and volunteers scrambling to meet the needs of these parents seeking help, without the support of Government funding.  PAIL network and its members have been instrumental in assisting with the passage of Bill 141 and continue to do incredible work in the community to help those who have nowhere else to turn to meet the unique needs of a parent of baby loss.</p>

<p>It is the fervent hope of those who participated in the parliamentary process of Bill 141, myself included, that the awareness created by the publicity of this bill alone will create a new network of support and knowledge with which the general population can support friends and family who are, or will be experiencing the loss of their baby.

I had just woken up this morning to the result of my first Hcg level at 3665.  I was hesitant but positive that was a pretty good level for 24DPO. However, one of the MW from my OB office just called me with the results of the second draw from Friday and it is 200 points lower. So this pregnancy will not work out either. 

I don't know what I'm feeling. I know I think these last 2 pregnancies have been a huge waste of time and emotions. I refuse still to lose hope. I have beautiful little girl and I'm grateful for this with all my heart. But this is not how I thought TTC #2 would be.

I'm waiting for my MW that I'm closest to to call me back and discuss her recommendations as far as work up, labs, and future attempts to try. But for now I guess I'll be waiting until nature takes its course (more waiting.)  

Like I said, I refuse to lose hope and I also refuse to let this pull me down into depression. I may never get the answers I want and I have to accept that. But, man, this sure sucks right now. 

I'm sending all my good wishes and prayers to those of you in this sub that are TTC or have a baby on the way. I'm grateful to have all of you to help me through this even if I'm just reading all of your own posts. 

EDIT: Thank you so much for all of your support. I can't tell you how perfectly timed it was to wake up to all of your kind words of support and empathy after waking up so often last night. I went home yesterday, threw on my pj's, and snuggled and watched movies with my 3 year old cutie all night and had a good time with her. I'll let you know if I find anything out in my workup that I'm going to ask for. Hugs to you all. 

EDIT 2: I spoke with my MW. She suspects either ectopic (because of the levels and timing of hcg)  or just an early fluke due to something wrong with the embryo and that it's not likely to be an issue with fertility. As of note my very first miscarriage was at 6 weeks and I had my daughter shortly after that. She said I'm healthy and have very good chances of conceiving.

So now I have questions about a few thing and instead of clicking a bunch of links I figured some of you ladies might have advice about the following and your thoughts on them. This includes using preseed during the BD, soft cups right after BD and natural progesterone after O.

I have some confusion over when to try again. My doctor said all seems ok, and that there are conflicting recommendations out there but her advice is to wait a cycle. 

My question about that is that once my period comes back, can we try again then? or should we wait for period to begin, wait a full cycle, wait for second period and then try? 

I'm not sure we want to just yet, but I guess it depends on how long it takes to get back to a normal cycle. ",t2_5ky1y,False,,0,False,New here.
