As expected I got a big fat ‚Äúhaha nope‚Äù back. But I decided to follow up with IA senator Jodi Ernst in this email. And I honestly don‚Äôt expect a reaction. But I needed to get this off my chest and I needed to speak up. So hopefully somewhere, sometime they will understand the importance of protecting a woman‚Äôs choice. 

I‚Äôve volunteered in my social circle and I‚Äôm the one others come to when they‚Äôre getting a bad diagnosis. I‚Äôve went with friends to ask questions with doctors when they couldn‚Äôt. I held them when they cried. All this just convinced me that NO ONE just has an abort!on for ‚Äúfunsies‚Äù like everyone is trying to make it out to be. 

Maybe this motivates you to write your senators and representatives. Our stories need to be heard so we can change minds. 



Dear Mrs. Ernst,

I hope I can speak frankly to you as a woman and mother. I implore you to protect the freedom of reproductive rights of all women. The conversation is always dominated by the fear that abort!ons are because a women changes her mind about having a baby or was ‚Äúcareless‚Äù. 

As a mother of 7 I am sure you understand the love for our children and the joys and scares of pregnancy. 

What I hope you understand is that we can not forget the mother‚Äôs who‚Äôs experienced the worst tragedy. I am 1 in 4. In 2017 my daughter was stillborn. I didn‚Äôt get a choice in the matter. It was the worst thing that happened to me and my family. My husband and I wanted this child so badly. She was diagnosed with Hypoplastic Left Heart Syndrom, 2 Cystic Hygroma, Hydrops Fetalis all caused by a genetic abnormality: Turner Syndrome. 

I‚Äôm sure you remember the excitement before each ultrasound. You expect to go home with a profile ultrasound of your new baby. You don‚Äôt expect the technician to fall silent, excuse herself and get the doctor. You don‚Äôt want the doctor to check your baby and say ‚ÄúI am so sorry. Your child won‚Äôt survive the next 4-8 weeks.‚Äù And make appointments for second opinionS. You don‚Äôt want to go on for more medical appointments that only confirm this diagnosis. You don‚Äôt want to sit in the waiting room with other expecting mothers who are talking about what color nursery they‚Äôre planning, what deals they just got on a car seat or clothes. Because that is all you wanted for this baby. You go on for weeks drinking something sweet when your baby hasn‚Äôt moved for a while to make sure she kicks. So you know she didn‚Äôt die yet. Because you weren‚Äôt allowed to make a choice. Because the law in your state - we lived in texas at the time - state that a mothers physical health needs to be in danger to allow a term!nation for medical reasons past the 20 week mark. The mothers mental health didn‚Äôt count. I was diagnosed with ante-natal depression. I was barely able to function to take care of my 20 month old child. I was hurting. Until one day, we went to our last ultrasound appointment. And they couldn‚Äôt find her heartbeat anymore. And gave me an appointment to be induced to give birth to my dead daughter. 

We had to go home without the baby girl we loved and wanted. We had to go and plan a funeral service. I developed post Partum depression. I can‚Äôt describe to you the pain of loosing a child. I can‚Äôt describe to you the weeks of mental anguish hoping, praying, crying for your child to not be dead yet. To never die. To hope to just stay pregnant forever. 

My story. Loosing our daughter Maria. Is why I am fighting to protect the freedom to choose for every woman. Because strict laws don‚Äôt take the mothers into account that have to face the most horrible of all realities. I never wanted to choose. I HAD to. And I wasn‚Äôt allowed to. The only things I have of my daughter are footprints, her ashes, 2 ultrasound photos and a few photos of her. I will never hear her laugh or cry or breathe. I will never hear her complain about how much she dislikes vegetables. Hear her say ‚ÄúI love you mommy‚Äù. She was always going to die before I met her. 

Instead I had to run the risk of her passing away in between appointments and developing a sepsis that could have been fatal and leave my older child motherless. 

So I know how difficult these choices are. Roe vs Wade needs to be protected. And abort!on laws need to include a mothers physical AND mental health as factors for a termination for medical reasons. I can not in good conscience stay silent. I‚Äôve found strength in advocating and helping women through this time. I needed to speak up for those women who are hurting so much they can not speak right now. This isn‚Äôt a question of democrats or republicans. This is a question of how much compassion we show women who are going through this. This is the reason a woman‚Äôs choice needs to be protected. 

And with Amy Coney Barrett as a Supreme Court Justice nominee, I fear for so many women. You have a seat on the judiciary committee. As a mother I beg you, please get her stance on the hardest of choices. Not abort!on as birth control. But a means to show mothers of fatally ill children compassion.

I figure this could potentially be a long shot, but since I am in the midst of waiting for various dr appts, I thought I would reach out and see if anyone on here has experienced anything similar 

I had a MMC in August, I was about 8 weeks. A week after the ultrasound, I had a D&C (Aug 28). Everything went fine, per my doctor. 

About a week after the D&C I started to experience what seemed to be UTI symptoms. Went to a clinic, normal urine, but they gave me an antibiotic anyway. That didn‚Äôt help the symptoms, and so at my follow up with my RE they did a vaginal ultrasound and all looked normal. He went ahead and prescribed me another antibiotic. This seemed to work, and symptoms were mildly better, then came back. Some days I have more of a pelvic pain, or almost tingly/burning close to my urethra or almost feels like my clitoris (??) maybe. That sensation makes it feel like I constantly need to urinate. There‚Äôs no pain when I do urinate, but it also never fully feels like my bladder is emptying. 

I saw my family dr and he has pretty much ruled out a UTI, and my urine culture has come back totally normal. He did blood work last week and I have a CT this week. It just seems suspicious to me that this all happened around the same time as the D&C, but no one is really pointing to any for sure cause. My period did come back on Saturday, so about 5 weeks after the D&C. 

Has anyone else experienced any sort of bladder/urethra/pelvic pain after their miscarriage? I don‚Äôt know if it is completely unrelated or something with the pregnancy and then loss has messed something up internally. I would like to try again, but feeling like this issue needs to be cleared up before moving forward, which just makes it all the more frustrating",t2_473r93y0,False,,0,False,"Ready to try again , but ongoing health issues causing frustration",[],r/ttcafterloss,False,0,question,0,,,False,t3_j5lpm5,False,dark,0.88,,public,6,0,{},,,False,[],,False,False,,{},Question,False,6,,False,self,False,,[],{},,True,,1601941368.0,text,0,,,text,self.ttcafterloss,False,"<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=""md""><p>I figure this could potentially be a long shot, but since I am in the midst of waiting for various dr appts, I thought I would reach out and see if anyone on here has experienced anything similar </p>

Before my miscarriages I was always a late ovulator. Fast forward to now and I have a peak on my cbfm on cd9! The last few months I have been ovulating on 13 or 14 but this is crazy.

Won't my eggs not be mature enough if I ovulate on cd 10?!  Could this be an error. I have been using the monitor for 5 months now. I do temp and noticed egg white yesterday but thought it was just a random estrogen surge. I DTD last night but omg. 


The only thing I can think of is that my week of pre period spotting is actually the start of my period...but I have been having that for months and never ovulated this early.

My milk came in after a few days and I bled/spotted for almost 18 days (not super heavy, just wouldn‚Äôt quit). I want to start TTC as soon as we can- I know I needed to wait 2 weeks for it to be safe for my cervix, but was told I could try anytime after that. 

Before my pregnancy I was extremely regular at 28-29 days/cycle and ovulated around CD14/15 like clockwork. 

Obviously my body is a hot mess right now, but I trended down my HCG (my OB didn‚Äôt offer to follow it with labs so I‚Äôve been using cheapies). I finally started getting negative HCG strips about 4-5 days ago at the same time I started seeing my LH trend up. 

When I tested LH with HCG five days ago, both were negative, so I‚Äôm fairly certain that my LH going up and peaking today are real. I‚Äôve also been temping but that has been all over the place I think as my HCG and other hormones were dropping after the D&E. 

My apps all say I should have ovulated (because of a year of past data) on CD14- but I know my LH was really low and I was still bleeding. So even with LH trending upwards the last few days and peaking tonight, my apps aren‚Äôt recognizing it as ovulation.

Hi all. I wanted to post this after things had simmered down a bit. A little over a week ago we had a couple users comment that they felt another user's post ranting about the Supreme Court nomination was ""political"" and not appropriate for this sub. In that post, a user engaged others in debate about ab0rtion and expressed their view that anti-ab0rtion laws do not affect people in this Subreddit.

As most of you know, this is entirely not the case. There have been numerous bills and laws put forth that explicitly restrict ab0rtion in the case of fetal anomalies ([source](https://www.guttmacher.org/evidence-you-can-use/banning-abortions-cases-race-or-sex-selection-or-fetal-anomaly)). Additionally, laws aimed at restricting ab0rtion rights also affect people seeking treatment for miscarriages, ectopic pregnancies, molar pregnancies, and stillbirth. I could write an entire post on the myriad of ways these laws affect literally all of us here, but this article compiles all of the information better than I ever could: [Understanding Pregnancy Loss in the Context of Aborti0n Restrictions and Fetal Harm Laws](https://www.guttmacher.org/evidence-you-can-use/banning-abortions-cases-race-or-sex-selection-or-fetal-anomaly).

I just want to reiterate that this Subreddit is a PRO-CHOICE, SAFE SPACE for people who've gone through all types of pregnancy loss - including ab0rtion for *any reason*. As such, it is absolutely NOT the place to debate ab0rtion or judge another member for their reproductive choices. I completely understand why the topic of TFMR or ab0rtion can be a triggering topic, and that's why we make an effort to tag posts with appropriate trigger warnings. If you find yourself triggered by the topic of ab0rtion, please just scroll past those posts instead of engaging. 

Lastly, a quick reminder to click ""Report"" on posts or comments that you think violate Reddit rules or this Subreddit's guidelines. We mods try to look through the sub as much as possible, but it's easy to miss things. By clicking ""report"", it will flag the comment/post and send us an anonymous alert message.

Thanks all. <3 

Quick edit: I just want to add, for those who are new and wondering why the sub bans the use of the word ab0rtion - it's because we've had problems in the past with trolls searching for that word using the Reddit search function, and coming here to debate or harass members on the topic. I suspect that might be where some of the commenters in the post I'm talking about came from. I understand its easy to accidentally type out the word and that's why Automoderator will generate an automatic reply asking you to change the spelling.

I've been lurking here for a fair while and don't usually post, but today I need to vent to people who are in the same boat. Just for some background: I'm 33, have been ttc since June 2019. Have had two early losses in that time- the first a PUL in October 2019, the second a D&C for a blighted ovum in early June. Both losses occurred within 2 weeks of my positive pt. It took me 11 weeks to get my first period after the D&C and have had 2 cycles ttc since.  I just got my period today so hope is dashed for another month.  
I have spent the day at a BBQ with a group of friends/acquaintances, each of whom had kids,  one who announced her 4th pregnancy. All day the chat was about pregnancy, birth and babies.  Only one friend knows I'm ttc and she knows limited details about my first loss only. Except for as they're happening,  I haven't really been too upset by my losses, in the sense that I don't feel like I lost a child because I've never stayed pregnant looking enough to have any symptoms or see a heartbeat. I know how common these experiences are and am mostly optimistic that my time will come.  But another unsuccessful cycle plus all of the baby chat today has got me really down.  When will it be my turn?  

I also have a close work colleague getting married this week and she plans to start ttc straight away. I'm not sure how I will cope if she gets pregnant before me.

Just for some background: I&#39;m 33, have been ttc since June 2019. Have had two early losses in that time- the first a PUL in October 2019, the second a D&amp;C for a blighted ovum in early June. Both losses occurred within 2 weeks of my positive pt. It took me 11 weeks to get my first period after the D&amp;C and have had 2 cycles ttc since.  I just got my period today so hope is dashed for another month.<br/>
I have spent the day at a BBQ with a group of friends/acquaintances, each of whom had kids,  one who announced her 4th pregnancy. All day the chat was about pregnancy, birth and babies.  Only one friend knows I&#39;m ttc and she knows limited details about my first loss only. Except for as they&#39;re happening,  I haven&#39;t really been too upset by my losses, in the sense that I don&#39;t feel like I lost a child because I&#39;ve never stayed pregnant looking enough to have any symptoms or see a heartbeat. I know how common these experiences are and am mostly optimistic that my time will come.  But another unsuccessful cycle plus all of the baby chat today has got me really down.  When will it be my turn?  </p>

<p>I also have a close work colleague getting married this week and she plans to start ttc straight away. I&#39;m not sure how I will cope if she gets pregnant before me. I kind of feel like I should tell her about my journey so that she knows to be sensitive but I&#39;m not good at being that vulnerable.</p>

So he said do a follow up with an ob in 2 days and do blood tests. My first hcg level at the er was 9,021. Following up with the ob 2 days later. My hcg level had risen to 11,181. She said it was an etopic and I had to go in to do one last ultrasound before getting a shot of methrotrexate. The us finally showed 1-2cm on the right side of my abdomen. I‚Äôm thinking my hcg levels were even higher because I didn‚Äôt get the shot til 2 days after the 11,181 hcg test. I was sent home to do two blood tests 4 and 7 days after the shot. Here are my hcg levels after the shot:
9/9/20 hcg at 11,181
9/14/20 hcg 8,704
9/19/20 hcg 8,041

66,2048,confidence,<praw.reddit.Reddit object at 0x7f12a630cd90>,,ttcafterloss,"Hi,  I was linked to this subreddit after posting a comment in another subreddit.

In January this year my husband was diagnosed with a pituitary brain tumour, which can affect fertility.  We'd struggled with conceiving for a long time before this diagnosis, but he started on medication, and we found out we were expecting in March!  2020 has honestly been a shit year for everyone, but so far this year we've had my husband's brain tumour (not cancerous and treatable with medication, but in some cases chemo and/or surgery may be necessary), he was diagnosed with diabetes (possibly linked to the hormone imbalance caused by the brain tumour), our dog was diagnosed with a life-long condition which needs him to be on medication and have monthly injections for the rest of his life, and our cat had some serious veterinary issues as a result of eating a wasp.

Our little boy was our little miracle - out of the blue just the light at the end of a shit year.  The year started to fly by as we looked towards December and our due date.  I had a major bleed at 11 weeks and I was convinced he was gone.  I called the midwife, got told to go to the hospital and sat in the waiting room (on my own - COVID restricted my husband from being able to come in with me and he had to sit in the car park for 3 hours while a slot opened up so they could ultrasound).  The first thing the sonographer said to me was that baby had a lovely strong heart beat.  I couldn't believe it, I was so convinced that he'd gone.  My husband and I were overjoyed - seeing that baby for the first time was just... mesmerising. We got the results of the chromosomal testing as well - extremely low risk for everything.

2 weeks later we had our first proper scan which was for dating.  Found out we were due at the start of December and we started making some plans.  My husband still wasn't allowed in for that scan so we booked a private scan for 17 weeks so he could see baby as well.  Private scan comes around, and baby has a lovely strong heartbeat, no obvious abnormalities and my husband just sits transfixed, staring at the big screen so excited.  

20 weeks is the abnormality scan at the hospital again.  Come through it with flying colours - no problems.  We've painted and decorated our nursery over the summer holidays (I'm a teacher, so not much time after we go back in September).  My sister-in-law has her little bundle at the end of August and we're so happy for her - excited to see her little one, and for his little cousin to arrive in 3 months.

I have a growth scan at 28 weeks (Monday 14th September).  Lovely strong heartbeat.  The words that keep going through my head.  Lovely strong heartbeat. They call someone else into the room and I think it's just to look at the cyst I have on my ovary that hasn't changed at all since the first scan back at 13 weeks.  My husband still could not come to this scan with me and has gone back to work (he's only been back 2 weeks after being diagnosed with his brain tumour).  They call me into a small room where a midwife and a doctor sit me down and tell me that my beautiful boy has an abnormality in his brain.  One of the vessels is 3mm larger than it should be.  In 80% of cases it means nothing really and will sort itself out, in 19% of cases it could mean that baby will have some slight learning difficulties and in 1% of cases it's something really serious.  The consultant makes it very clear that all of our options are available to us, despite the lateness of the pregnancy.

I call my husband and tell him to come to the hospital.  They go through it all again with him.  We have an appointment made at a specialist paediatric unit at a hospital 45 minutes away for that Friday.  I'm trying to keep calm, stress isn't good for the baby and the odds are good for us.  The consultant had said that the only way to know is to have an MRI.  We go to the hospital again on Friday, have another ultrasound, no change.  We're referred for an MRI and are told that it will probably be sometime the following week.  My husband and I are told 30 minutes later that we have an MRI scan booked for that same afternoon.

I have the MRI (my husband is not allowed in for this one again) and I'm told that the paediatric neurologist will call that evening sometime around 9pm.  The whole time I'm in the MRI I can feel baby kicking so, so hard.  I'm thinking surely it's got to be okay - I've never felt him kick so much.  They put something over my tummy to pick up baby's brain better and it felt the whole time like he was trying to kick it off.

9.30pm the neurologist calls.  Baby has large scale brain damage from the damaged blood vessel.  He will have problems with movement, speech, language, emotional problems, and basically, everything is damaged.  His quality of life would be extremely poor for the few days that he would be with us.  It's entirely possible he would pass away after taking his first breath.  If he survived that, they're taking days at the most, and those few days would be extremely painful for him.

That weekend was the worst weekend of our lives.  We talked about nothing else but what to do.  We decided that letting him go now was by far the kinder thing to do for him.  Our beautiful boy, our much-wanted boy.

Monday 21st we have an appointment to talk to the second consultant we saw.  He talked us through again what our boy's short life would be like, and that with the damage done it was more likely that his first breath would be what ended his life.  The doctor assured us that he would go to sleep painlessly.

Wednesday 23rd our beautiful boy went to sleep.  He had been moving around and kicking just minutes before.  

Friday 25th we were admitted to hospital to be induced.  Our darling boy was born sleeping at 2.45am on Monday 28th.  We spent all night holding him.  All day with him.  We had a photographer come to take his picture.  Someone came to take some castings of his beautiful hands and feet.  They were so perfect.  You'd never have known anything was wrong just by looking at him.

There's a hole in our hearts.  We both feel like we're going through the motions.  How do you get past this?  We've both talked about trying again but I feel like we're betraying our boy.

My husband still wasn&#39;t allowed in for that scan so we booked a private scan for 17 weeks so he could see baby as well.  Private scan comes around, and baby has a lovely strong heartbeat, no obvious abnormalities and my husband just sits transfixed, staring at the big screen so excited.  </p>

<p>20 weeks is the abnormality scan at the hospital again.  Come through it with flying colours - no problems.  We&#39;ve painted and decorated our nursery over the summer holidays (I&#39;m a teacher, so not much time after we go back in September).  My sister-in-law has her little bundle at the end of August and we&#39;re so happy for her - excited to see her little one, and for his little cousin to arrive in 3 months.</p>

<p>I have a growth scan at 28 weeks (Monday 14th September).  Lovely strong heartbeat.  The words that keep going through my head.  Lovely strong heartbeat. They call someone else into the room and I think it&#39;s just to look at the cyst I have on my ovary that hasn&#39;t changed at all since the first scan back at 13 weeks.  My husband still could not come to this scan with me and has gone back to work (he&#39;s only been back 2 weeks after being diagnosed with his brain tumour).  They call me into a small room where a midwife and a doctor sit me down and tell me that my beautiful boy has an abnormality in his brain.  One of the vessels is 3mm larger than it should be.  In 80% of cases it means nothing really and will sort itself out, in 19% of cases it could mean that baby will have some slight learning difficulties and in 1% of cases it&#39;s something really serious.  The consultant makes it very clear that all of our options are available to us, despite the lateness of the pregnancy.</p>

<p>I call my husband and tell him to come to the hospital.  They go through it all again with him.  We have an appointment made at a specialist paediatric unit at a hospital 45 minutes away for that Friday.  I&#39;m trying to keep calm, stress isn&#39;t good for the baby and the odds are good for us.  The consultant had said that the only way to know is to have an MRI.  We go to the hospital again on Friday, have another ultrasound, no change.  We&#39;re referred for an MRI and are told that it will probably be sometime the following week.  My husband and I are told 30 minutes later that we have an MRI scan booked for that same afternoon.</p>

<p>I have the MRI (my husband is not allowed in for this one again) and I&#39;m told that the paediatric neurologist will call that evening sometime around 9pm.  The whole time I&#39;m in the MRI I can feel baby kicking so, so hard.  I&#39;m thinking surely it&#39;s got to be okay - I&#39;ve never felt him kick so much.  They put something over my tummy to pick up baby&#39;s brain better and it felt the whole time like he was trying to kick it off.</p>

<p>9.30pm the neurologist calls.  Baby has large scale brain damage from the damaged blood vessel.  He will have problems with movement, speech, language, emotional problems, and basically, everything is damaged.  His quality of life would be extremely poor for the few days that he would be with us.  It&#39;s entirely possible he would pass away after taking his first breath.  If he survived that, they&#39;re taking days at the most, and those few days would be extremely painful for him.</p>

<p>That weekend was the worst weekend of our lives.  We talked about nothing else but what to do.  We decided that letting him go now was by far the kinder thing to do for him.  Our beautiful boy, our much-wanted boy.</p>

<p>Monday 21st we have an appointment to talk to the second consultant we saw.  He talked us through again what our boy&#39;s short life would be like, and that with the damage done it was more likely that his first breath would be what ended his life.  The doctor assured us that he would go to sleep painlessly.</p>

<p>Wednesday 23rd our beautiful boy went to sleep.  He had been moving around and kicking just minutes before.  </p>

<p>Friday 25th we were admitted to hospital to be induced.  Our darling boy was born sleeping at 2.45am on Monday 28th.  We spent all night holding him.  All day with him.  We had a photographer come to take his picture.  Someone came to take some castings of his beautiful hands and feet.  They were so perfect.  You&#39;d never have known anything was wrong just by looking at him.</p>

<p>There&#39;s a hole in our hearts.  We both feel like we&#39;re going through the motions.  How do you get past this?  We&#39;ve both talked about trying again but I feel like we&#39;re betraying our boy.</p>

<p>I know this is really long, and I&#39;m sure not many people will read it, but thank you for letting me post.</p>

I joined about a month ago and have been quietly lurking with a few comments on posts here and there.



I'm feeling really deflated.

Do you ever get those months where you think you 'just know' you're pregnant?

It's so stupid, isn't it.

My period isn't due for a few days and I make it a rule to not test until I'm 3 days past my expected period date.. (saves a tonne of money and a few less tears)

Yet, this time, because I 'just know' I tested today.

Negative.

Of course.



I'm especially sad because if my period does arrive, there are 3 things that will destroy me, at least for a little while.

1) I won't be pregnant

2) The '3 month super fertile after miscarriage woo hoo yay' phase will be over

3) it will mark a year since we started trying. (I know this might not be very long to some, but we all hope we won't get to a whole year of trying without a successful pregnancy, right?!)


Just feeling it today.
I wrote a comment the other day saying how conflicted I feel about this group:
1)It's great because we're all in it together, and we have that support.

2)It's shit that we're all in it together, why us?



Lots of love to you all, this has been a little therapeutic for me so hopefully people don't mind this post.

<p>3) it will mark a year since we started trying. (I know this might not be very long to some, but we all hope we won&#39;t get to a whole year of trying without a successful pregnancy, right?!)</p>

<p>Just feeling it today.
I wrote a comment the other day saying how conflicted I feel about this group:
1)It&#39;s great because we&#39;re all in it together, and we have that support.</p>

<p>2)It&#39;s shit that we&#39;re all in it together, why us?</p>

<p>Lots of love to you all, this has been a little therapeutic for me so hopefully people don&#39;t mind this post.</p>

Did anyone TTC before their HCG hit zero and did it cause any issues? On July 30th, I had a NIPT determine high risk for triploidy and the ultrasound the following day determined the baby had stopped grown at 8 and a half weeks, although I was 12 weeks and there was no more heartbeat. I had a D&C and Dr was concerned about a risk for partial molar pregnancy because my HcG was 120,354.

My timeline of events is as follows:

\- Aug 1: 120,354 (night before D&C)

\- Aug 20: 347

\- Aug 28: got the MMR booster (long story short - the Dr's noticed after I was pregnant that I was not immune so I couldn't get it earlier - was told to not TTC for 28 days)

\- Sep 15: 30

\- Sep 19: Ultrasound saw no retained product but interestingly noticed a follicle on my right ovary so they said I was in the process of ovulation (which I sensed from cramps and discharge)

Today I had an ultrasound confirming that my miscarriage is successfully 100% out of my uterus with no complications. 

Thank. Goodness. 

WELL...

Yesterday (once I realized the bleeding was almost done) I dusted off my ovulation kits, just because I was curious if my LH levels were anything. I was surprised to see not necessarily a spike, but definitely a much darker line than I was anticipating. Levels I got a couple days before and after the day after ovulation. Late this morning I did another test, and LH levels were much lower.

Damn.

Did I already ovulate, less than a week after my miscarriage started???? It seems so soon. Every google search I've done says that the range for ovulation is 8-40 days after miscarriage and it's been less than a week. Unless that number starts on the day that baby passed away and growth stopped?? 

Bleh. I'm just kind of like... I want to get pregnant again! The waiting is always so lame. On top of it all, the timing is kind of important to me. I'm a stepmom, and my husband has 3 kids from a previous marriage. All 3 of my stepkids were born within a month of each other in July-August. Of all the months in the year, I REALLY would have preferred to not be pregnant on the exact same timeline that my husband's ex-wife was 3 times. It's hard enough living through the reality that my husband has been through this before with someone else, without it also happening on the exact same timeline.

So if this ovulation is already passed and I missed my chance at a June baby, then it either means continuing to try and learning how to be okay with a July or August baby, or not trying for a few months so that I can be on my own timeline and have an Autumn baby rather than a Summer baby. 

Ugh. And during all of this, I'm just thinking ""Fuck. The perfect month would have been that Spring baby I lost...""

Good god I'm just word vomitting at this point.

After trying for 3 months I finally got my very first BFP but two weeks after that I started miscarrying. It started with very light brown spotting (only for a day or 2) and almost no cramps at all. I did feel less pregnant if that makes any sense. My doctor recommended drawing hcg and progesterone levels. On the first blood draw my hcg was normal and my progesterone was low but on the second blood draw both had decreased and eventually I started bleeding. 

While talking to my mother about it, she mentioned that the same thing happened to her in her last 2 pregnancies and her doctor started her on progesterone. 
My question is, for anyone who has started on progesterone to prevent miscarriages, how early in the pregnancy did you start progesterone supplementation? 

Also my partner thinks it‚Äôs his fault, (in a previous relationship the same thing happened) which I‚Äôm pretty sure it‚Äôs not but if he wants to get his sperm tested, does he need to go to a fertility specialist? Or is this a last resort since it‚Äôs our very first miscarriage?

150,2048,confidence,<praw.reddit.Reddit object at 0x7f12a630cd90>,,ttcafterloss,"This is a long story. Please bare with me.

I'm a 36 year old woman, who for years was infertile. I had PCOS since I was a teen, which would cause me to be irregular and I would have to take birth control in order to GET my periods. My husband and I, who've been together for 10 years and married for 3, have tried on and off for the past decade to get pregnant. I used to be 340 lbs, and I'm only 5'2.5"". In June of 2017, I had went to my gyno in hopes she would give me clomid to ovulate. Instead, she recommended me to get Gastric Bypass surgery. She herself had it done, and was successful. This wasn't the first time she recommended it, either. Finally, I took the plunge. Dec 2017 I had my surgery. I lost 200 lbs (40 prior to surgery) and down to 140 lbs. I'm healthy, my periods returned to normal only THREE months after surgery, and in June I got 8 lbs of excess skin removed. ....to only conceive FOR THE FIRST TIME 2 weeks or so later. It was mindblowing, and unexpected.

August 9th I found out I'm pregnant. I took 2 at home tests, getting big fat positives RIGHT AWAY. I was.....shocked. This never happened to me, and to see one right away?? I was in utter disbelief. There was NO WAY this could be. I called my doctor, told them, set up an ultrasound, continued to be in shock. My husband was really surprised as well.

August 18th, I had an ultrasound, finding out I'm 7weeks,6 days along. With TWINS. TWINS! The ultrasound tech says ""Do twins run in your family?"" I said ""No..."" Because I didn't know. Then she tells me I'm carrying twins. My husband was there with me. We were so floored. Nervous, overwhelmed, excited, scared. We floated on a cloud the rest of the day, and for days after.

September 17th I went in for my 12 week ultrasound. We found out I lost one of the twins when I was only 8 weeks,4 days. My nephew's birthday. We were heartbroken. They thought it was due to a chromosomal abnormality, but weren't sure. Then, I get news that not only did one baby not make it.....but the second one had some abnormal thing pop up on the ultrasound. The ultrasound tech was concerned about it, but my gyno thought maybe it was just a leftover yolk sac, but she wasn't sure. The other thing she thought it could possibly be is an abdominal wall defect, fixable with surgery, after baby is born. So she sent me to a MFM an hour away, just to be sure all was ok. If he thought there was issues, I'd see a geneticist as well.

On my birthday, Sept 22nd, I went to the town an hour away (didn't even realize it was on my birthday when I had it scheduled) and got the ultrasound. My husband and I, sitting there, seeing this new machine the tech said they had gotten...it was all crystal clear. That huge mass was there, easily seen. We were worried, but still hopeful. So I see the MFM specialist.....the nurse comes in, as well as the geneticist. MFM walks up to a whiteboard, begins to draw. The nurse says ""just a sec....."" leaves, comes back with tissues. My husband and I each silently thought ""Oh boy. This isn't good news....""

Turns out,there is a big cystic growth, likely a lethal anomaly, bigger than the baby, that is causing the umbilical cord to wrap all around the mass completely and reconnect. They aren't sure what the growth is, it could be a chromosomal defect, or a fluke accident. But it could be an omphalocele, a genetic defect with the umbilical cord. Or a urinary outflow tract obstruction, which could clear itself on it's own, but either way its messing up development of baby. It's when the urinary tract outflow is blocked, causing the urine to back up into that mass. They said it's possible that if I waited until a 16 week scan, that it would clear up on it's own, if it was that; however development is still being messed with. Or there's a possibility of gastroschisis, an abdominal wall defect which would cause many surgeries possibly, if they could even survive it. Hip socket likely wont form due to the growth, that is stretching the legs around and causing them to not form, think of a cleft palate, the growth is causing the hips to form funny or not at all, like how a cleft lip forms. Organs may not be forming and even if they do, wont function properly. Even if lungs work, baby would outgrow them and then they wont work. Baby would slowly suffocate. He or she might have stomach issues or heart issues further down.

So their best advice was to ""interrupt the pregnancy."" Outcome not being good. The MFM said he could do a test that same day to see what's going on, but he was scared that if he went in there with a needle, he would kill our baby, saying it's that bad. Otherwise I had the option to wait, and do the 16 week scan, the invasive testing one, which also has a small chance of miscarriage, but as I said earlier, this wasn't recommended either. This news. We were devastated. Not our surviving baby! We just lost the other one....now we were faced with THIS difficult decision! We talked to the geneticist, who was very thorough, and then husband and I talked for a bit alone in private, deciding termination was the best thing for this poor baby.

My gyno back in town won't perform terminations, so I met with the gyno there immediately after seeing the geneticist, that would. (Well, actually had to wait an hour or hour and a half for her to arrive, as she was busy) She talked to us some more, also saying termination would be best. Note, all 3 doctors I saw, also made sure I was aware that they would support whatever decision I would go with. On tuesday, I'm supposed to go through with this, getting a D&C. They would take live tissue from the baby, send it to a lab, regrow it, test to see if there were genetic issues, and if so, they would further test my husband and I. There's also a possibility this just happened...fluke. Also note, the twins each had their own separate amniotic sac, so likely the other baby was NOT affected by the same thing.

We both know the best option for us is to terminate this pregnacy. My worries though are..what If I don't get pregnant again? What if this happens again? We are hopeful and want to continue trying. But at the same time, a small part of me wants this baby to survive. But we couldn't handle a special needs child. We aren't equipped financially, and I suffer from mental health issues. I keep getting bits of hope, thinking ""maybe this WILL clear on its own, maybe it's that urinary tract obstruction.."" to only then get reminded of the fact that the baby's legs are being forced around this giant mass. They also said the mass could be something else, that they just don't know, since they can't actually physically see the baby. So then a part of me wants to wait until the 16 week scan. Which, next week, I would be 14 weeks. But that had meant another month of the baby suffering with its legs around this mass. And then possibly another month after that, waiting on test results to see just what is going on.

Has anyone here experienced this? Anyone have any thoughts of what could be going on? I need advice...I can't believe I'm going to have the dreaded ""abort!on"" word. This has been so hard. So utterly heartbreaking. Husband and I have been so down, so out of it. He can't focus at work. I can't stop thinking about this poor baby. I know what to do, but I DON'T know what to do at the same time.

Please bare with me.</p>

<p>I&#39;m a 36 year old woman, who for years was infertile. I had PCOS since I was a teen, which would cause me to be irregular and I would have to take birth control in order to GET my periods. My husband and I, who&#39;ve been together for 10 years and married for 3, have tried on and off for the past decade to get pregnant. I used to be 340 lbs, and I&#39;m only 5&#39;2.5&quot;. In June of 2017, I had went to my gyno in hopes she would give me clomid to ovulate. Instead, she recommended me to get Gastric Bypass surgery. She herself had it done, and was successful. This wasn&#39;t the first time she recommended it, either. Finally, I took the plunge. Dec 2017 I had my surgery. I lost 200 lbs (40 prior to surgery) and down to 140 lbs. I&#39;m healthy, my periods returned to normal only THREE months after surgery, and in June I got 8 lbs of excess skin removed. ....to only conceive FOR THE FIRST TIME 2 weeks or so later. It was mindblowing, and unexpected.</p>

<p>August 9th I found out I&#39;m pregnant. I took 2 at home tests, getting big fat positives RIGHT AWAY. I was.....shocked. This never happened to me, and to see one right away?? I was in utter disbelief. There was NO WAY this could be. I called my doctor, told them, set up an ultrasound, continued to be in shock. My husband was really surprised as well.</p>

<p>August 18th, I had an ultrasound, finding out I&#39;m 7weeks,6 days along. With TWINS. TWINS! The ultrasound tech says &quot;Do twins run in your family?&quot; I said &quot;No...&quot; Because I didn&#39;t know. Then she tells me I&#39;m carrying twins. My husband was there with me. We were so floored. Nervous, overwhelmed, excited, scared. We floated on a cloud the rest of the day, and for days after.</p>

<p>September 17th I went in for my 12 week ultrasound. We found out I lost one of the twins when I was only 8 weeks,4 days. My nephew&#39;s birthday. We were heartbroken. They thought it was due to a chromosomal abnormality, but weren&#39;t sure. Then, I get news that not only did one baby not make it.....but the second one had some abnormal thing pop up on the ultrasound.

I‚Äôm 32 years old and I‚Äôve been TTC since August 2019. Got pregnant in September 2019, found a blighted ovum at my 8 week check up that November and had a D&C later that month. Got pregnant again in January 2020, lost that pregnancy around 6-8 weeks as well. We did genetic testing on that fetus and all came back clear. I‚Äôve done run through the gamut of testing (HSG, bloodwork, hysteroscopy to remove a small polyp in August, etc.). The only slightly off thing my OBGYN has found is that I‚Äôve been on low end of normal with my progesterone. She suspects I could have a luteal phase defect and has had me using progesterone suppositories following ovulation.

At my hysteroscopy post-op appointment, we decided I would try to conceive w/o meds in September and, if that didn‚Äôt work, move on to using Letrozole (generic of Femara). Well, I just started my no good, horrible period in the middle of the night so Sunday I will begin taking the meds.

Just wondering if any of y‚Äôall have used these meds for recurrent pregnancy loss? Would love to hear success stories or any advice of questions to ask my OBGYN or bloodwork you have had done.

159,2048,confidence,<praw.reddit.Reddit object at 0x7f12a630cd90>,,ttcafterloss,"Hi everyone, 

I'm new here. I didn't expect to find myself here, but nonetheless here I am. 

I'm kind of going through it right now. It's getting to be a lot to deal with so I was hoping maybe this sub is the right place to find some sort of support. 

I am two weeks post-termination. It was not a wanted termination, the pregnancy was very wanted. It was my DH and I's first child together, a baby girl. We both really wanted a girl. I have a lot of mother daughter issues, my mom is a class A narcissist. She had been horrible to me the entire length of my short pregnancy. 

We found out after the weekend of our gender reveal that our baby had an abnormality. We were directed to MFM for further testing and final diagnostics. Our baby had open spina bifida. I did so much research in the few short weeks I had to make my decision to keep her or terminate her. I was the most horrible time in my life. I've never knew so much pain until I had to make this decision. SB is tricky because a lot of kids are born with it and survive and live happy lives. I joined several FB groups on parents who have kids with SB and I posted my story, hanging on to any hope I could for a positive outcome. I was flooded with positive comments and messages saying it wasn't that bad. And even though I felt comforted by their experiences and support, I saw a lot of pictures and heard a lot of stories about kids who need braces to walk, or have to cath every 4 hours, some are paralyzed from the waist down. Many have had so many surgeries all starting from birth. It horrified me. It horrified me for my little girls life. I tried to picture what her life would be like, and it made me sad. I got a message from a woman who had an adult daughter with SB. She told me honestly that I should think about how I see the next 20 and even beyond that years. She told me the truths, the bad stuff, which i was very appreciative for because so many of the parents only told me the good stuff. She told me her daughter has been permanently wheelchair bound, and even though it doesn't effect her life in huge ways (she lives independently, she has a fiance etc. she told me how the medical bills have stacked up to half a million dollars for all of her surgeries over the years, she told me of the pain her daughter went through and still goes through. She says she never regrets bringing her daughter into the world, but she urged me to take an honest look at what my life, and my babies life would be and make the right choice for myself and the baby. 

I really took what she said to heart and I thought about every positive and negative to bringing her into this world. At many points my husband and I were fully ready to take on the challenge and were positive, but unfortunately many more were spent crying and knowing she would have struggles. What made us decide to terminate was speaking to the specialists at MFM. We asked questions on how her life would look, how bad her condition would be and they told us that they can't give us specifics on that because every child is different and the condition can't really be determined in severity until the baby is born. It was too much uncertainty. They told me getting surgery while the baby is in utero would be beneficial and greatly reduce the impacts of her condition, but it was risky and may not work to the fullest. they also told me it would mean early C-section, as well as possible troubles carrying a baby in the future to full term.  So at the end of the day on Sep 10th I went through with a D+E at 19 weeks. It was traumatizing, but the hospital staff was so sweet and really helped me be calm. They were not judgmental the least bit and it made the already horrible experience much much better. However, I have been a wreck. I have been doing better emotionally as far as not crying every other day, but I'm empty and sad. My pregnancy symptoms have vanished and I don't feel my baby girl anymore. I feel the immediate need to become pregnant again, I obviously have to wait at least three months before trying again but it's so hard. On top of this my mother never reached out to me before or after the surgery to see how I was doing and I just feel neglected or unloved. My husband has been a life saver throughout this whole thing. I took a month off from work to emotionally recover and I am back today and It's so odd. It's like life just got back to normal and I find myself getting emotional thinking about things like ""Last time I was at work I was pregnant"" ""last time we went here I was pregnant and now I'm not"" etc. Just wondering if any other ladies have been through this and how you cope with this new normal until you can start trying again.

I went to see an RE yesterday and overall while she acknowledged my lower ovarian reserve, she felt that due to my age and the fact that we only want one child, it might be worthwhile to try again on our own instead of moving straight to IVF. She did acknowledge that the pain of miscarriage is too hard for some people to risk again, so it would be reasonable if I wanted to go to IVF with genetic testing to reduce that risk. However, based on the time spent on IVF (and that I'd probably need multiple cycles to retrieve enough eggs), and the cost, she felt like we would likely have success trying again on our own, especially since so far I've been able to get pregnant quickly. Of note, IVF is not covered by my insurance so it'd all be out of pocket.

My history:

31F, went off the pill in April, first period off the pill in May, had a chemical pregnancy in early June (wasn't tracking OPKs so unsure of how far along, but probably 4-5 weeks)--went to get blood draws and HCG dropped, had bleeding similar to a heavy period. Ovulated about 2 weeks after HPTs were negative and got pregnant again. Had a MMC at 9w after two previous ultrasounds at 6w and 8.5w with heartbeats. Had a D&C and genetic testing showed a triploidy female. Ovulated again about 2 weeks after D&C (confirmed by ultrasound at follow-up appointment), just got period about 2 weeks after ovulation.

RPL testing: TSH \~1, A1C 5.6%, negative for blood clotting disorders (APS, factor deficiencies, etc), vitamin D level was 57. AMH 0.87 ng/mL, day 3 FSH 9.4 mIU/mL, estradiol 62 pg/mL, AFC 9.

Pending test results: chromosomal analysis (to see if I have a balanced translocation), saline sonogram scheduled for tomorrow, RE also recommended my OB do an endometrial biopsy to see if I have chronic endometritis.

Husband had a normal SA and his chromosomal analysis came back with a normal karyotype.

Of course, the RE mentioned if I do come back with an abnormal karyotype that changes everything.

I know this is a personal decision, but I'm wondering if anyone has feedback for me.

<p>Back to the point, I bought myoinositol supplements and have been taking about 2,000 mg/day for about two weeks now with nothing to show for it‚ÄîI didn‚Äôt know what I expected, but I was angry with my OB‚Äôs office and bought them anyway because what‚Äôs another 40 bucks on infertility vitamins/supplements/magic spells. </p>

<p>Anyway, have any of you tried or had success with myoinositol for ovulation? When, if at all, did you start having some regularity in your cycles?</p>

<p>TL;DR Bought magic infertility vitamin pills that aren‚Äôt working as much or as fast as I hoped they would. Has anyone or when did anyone here had any success with myoinositol for PCOS  and/or ovulation?</p>

181,2048,confidence,<praw.reddit.Reddit object at 0x7f12a630cd90>,,ttcafterloss,"Appologies for rant .* possible spelling errors and whatnot, but hey it‚Äôs a rant*

So. Healthcare sucks. Last year with my wife and I decided we wanted to try and add to our family it took six months to get the initial gynecological visit. To get advice to get a general idea of what we were doing wrong or what her options were, since were over 30, and my wife is transitioning. I just don‚Äôt get how it takes six months. Or why we have to wait a year before we are allowed to talk about needing help. 

Granted I didn‚Äôt want to be here because I‚Äôm impatient. And given my situation I figured I would throw some elbows and make room, and hopefully get some information and help. I got some. I got pregnant eight months into our journey. Miscarried seven weeks three days later. Right after my 32nd birthday. And in between all that there‚Äôs all this time and shuffling around to different sections of a hospital or healthcare. And phone calls to insurance and making sure everything under the sun is possibly covered. 

But after the miscarriage it felt like I got dropped. There is one follow up over the phone, because of Covid I understand. But it felt like it wasn‚Äôt a big deal. And I feel like I‚Äôm about to cry, which I hate, because I‚Äôve done so much of that this year. I‚Äôm sure all of you understand my frustration. This event in our life however many times it happens to someone you gets left behind. You‚Äôre told it just wasn‚Äôt meant to happen, or you‚Äôll have better luck the next time.
By the way these are things I‚Äôve been told by not just close family but strangers. 
And yes unfortunately this little one that we wanted to add to our family didn‚Äôt happen long enough to be ours, in our arms at least. And that sucks so bad.

But adding the healthcare stuff to it just doesn‚Äôt help. So now I‚Äôm experiencing bad pains every month. Not around menstruation like you would expect but around ovulation. And I‚Äôm not talking mittleSchmertz the tiny little pain let you know somethings happening. I‚Äôm talking get a heating pad and some good pain meds and you‚Äôre gonna be out of commission for a few days pain. And when talking to the gynecologist office they‚Äôve informed me I should be seen in the next two months. Not before then. I‚Äôm on a waiting list. But that‚Äôs it. My pain means nothing. It sucks. 

And a kicker the other day my wife told me that one of her coworkers had him announced everyone roughly around the same time we found out we were pregnant that his wife was as well. Well that sweet little one was born yesterday. And I wish them all the luck in the world. But right now I kind of need them.

<p>So. Healthcare sucks. Last year with my wife and I decided we wanted to try and add to our family it took six months to get the initial gynecological visit. To get advice to get a general idea of what we were doing wrong or what her options were, since were over 30, and my wife is transitioning. I just don‚Äôt get how it takes six months. Or why we have to wait a year before we are allowed to talk about needing help. </p>

<p>Granted I didn‚Äôt want to be here because I‚Äôm impatient. And given my situation I figured I would throw some elbows and make room, and hopefully get some information and help. I got some. I got pregnant eight months into our journey. Miscarried seven weeks three days later. Right after my 32nd birthday. And in between all that there‚Äôs all this time and shuffling around to different sections of a hospital or healthcare. And phone calls to insurance and making sure everything under the sun is possibly covered. </p>

<p>But after the miscarriage it felt like I got dropped. There is one follow up over the phone, because of Covid I understand. But it felt like it wasn‚Äôt a big deal. And I feel like I‚Äôm about to cry, which I hate, because I‚Äôve done so much of that this year. I‚Äôm sure all of you understand my frustration. This event in our life however many times it happens to someone you gets left behind. You‚Äôre told it just wasn‚Äôt meant to happen, or you‚Äôll have better luck the next time.
By the way these are things I‚Äôve been told by not just close family but strangers. 
And yes unfortunately this little one that we wanted to add to our family didn‚Äôt happen long enough to be ours, in our arms at least. And that sucks so bad.</p>

<p>But adding the healthcare stuff to it just doesn‚Äôt help. So now I‚Äôm experiencing bad pains every month. Not around menstruation like you would expect but around ovulation. And I‚Äôm not talking mittleSchmertz the tiny little pain let you know somethings happening. I‚Äôm talking get a heating pad and some good pain meds and you‚Äôre gonna be out of commission for a few days pain. And when talking to the gynecologist office they‚Äôve informed me I should be seen in the next two months. Not before then. I‚Äôm on a waiting list. But that‚Äôs it. My pain means nothing. It sucks. </p>

<p>And a kicker the other day my wife told me that one of her coworkers had him announced everyone roughly around the same time we found out we were pregnant that his wife was as well. Well that sweet little one was born yesterday. And I wish them all the luck in the world. But right now I kind of need them. We are going to be getting a nice basket of stuff together for them, because the nice part of me says that would be a good thing to do. It would be a positive thing to do. I also want to make some outfits and take them to the hospital for their littlest little ones or whomever I make stuff to fit for. </p>

<p>The possibilities swirl through my head all day, especially when I‚Äôm trying to focus or sleep. I think I officially need professional help.</p>

<p>Does anyone else feel plagued by these sort of thoughts?</p>

She had congenital toxoplasmosis,  resulting in severe ventriculomegaly/hydrocephaly and would have likely been little more than a vegetable if she had lived. 
I went through menopause early, so need IVF and donor eggs. My cousin is our donor. We had 8 frozen embryos. Romilly was our 7th transfer, before her I had 2 biochemicals, 2 miscarriages at 6 weeks and 2 BFNs. 

We have 1 embryo left. We have been cleared to transfer it as soon as we're ready. We have tentatively booked to do it in late January, so 7 months after her loss. I don't want to do it any earlier,   because I don't want to have the same due date or milestone dates, I don't want to spend a 2nd christmas in a row terrified to go to the toilet in case I see blood. 

But I don't want to leave it any later. I need a baby to hold, to raise, to pull out my hair over, to sing to sleep and kiss every inch of. I'm 38 and our funding runs out when I hit 40, and our donor turns 37 in April and technically can't donate after that so if this next embryo doesn't work we need to do another egg collection before April.

Anyway, how do you get over the fear? With Romilly's pregnancy,  even right up until we found out she was sick at 23 weeks, I was terrified.

One bonus is that now i've had toxoplasmosis I cant get that again. But how do I put anything in my mouth, or touch a surface, walk down the road, pick up anything heavier than a book, rub cream on my hands... without having a panic attack?

207,2048,confidence,<praw.reddit.Reddit object at 0x7f12a630cd90>,,ttcafterloss,"So, I just had a TFMR a few days ago at 20 weeks. It‚Äôs been SO hard. This was our ‚Äúmiracle baby‚Äù after years of infertility and when we found out that our baby was very very sick- T21 with cystic hygroma and severe hydrops- our hearts broke into a million pieces. 

I was not feeling very sexual during the pregnancy- in the beginning I was paranoid it wouldn‚Äôt stick (I had some early bleeding and a SCH) so they gave me ‚Äúpelvic rest‚Äù- then I had terrible migraines and all day nausea for weeks before we found out she had problems. Then it was a month of ultrasounds/amnio and discussing TFMR‚Äî all of which means I‚Äôve been a crying blob of mess for the last month. SUPER unsexy. I‚Äôve lived in sweatpants and t-shirts and have barely gotten out of bed.

My husband has been SO SO amazing in every way. Even though it‚Äôs been hard for him, and I know he doesn‚Äôt fully understand everything I‚Äôm going through, he tries really hard. Since the procedure, I was bleeding like a stuck pig (I bought some of the ‚Äúovernight‚Äù pads + underwear so I wouldn‚Äôt leak out anywhere and it feels like an adult diaper). So sexy. My breasts are engorged and leaking- so I‚Äôm in a tight sports bra 24/7 and when I change it, it‚Äôs all damp and smells weird. So so sexy. I hadn‚Äôt been bleeding for 24 hours so I came to bed tonight without a pad on (thinking it was over) and then suddenly bled through my pajamas and onto the bedsheets and my husband was super cool about it but I had a massive breakdown of embarrassment and feeling like a leaky fat cow from every hole in my body. 

Seriously- I am worried my husband will never find me attractive ever again. I‚Äôm already worried he‚Äôs not emotionally ready to TTC again despite the years it took for a positive test the first time and the fact that I‚Äôm 37- I don‚Äôt have a moment to waste. But now I feel like he can‚Äôt see me in a sexual way. I only gained about 6 pounds in my pregnancy- but my body is out of wack right now- I can‚Äôt fit in my regular clothes, I still look a little pregnant in my belly, my boobs are hard and square shaped from being engorged and shoved in a tight sports bra. I‚Äôm leaking from everywhere and it‚Äôs gross (even though I know it‚Äôs normal). 

We want to plan a romantic weekend away- and I desperately want him to look at me and touch me and feel sexually attracted to me again. I‚Äôm afraid he thinks he will harm me if he has sex with me, or that his dick is just never going to want to work again after everything we‚Äôve been through. 

I feel so embarrassed that I was kind of sexy dancing for him tonight when he casually mentioned to me I was bleeding through my pajamas. I cried and cried and he told me I was beautiful and hot and he loved me but I felt so stupid. 

Any advice? How did you find your sexy again after all of the ‚Äúugly‚Äù parts of losing a pregnancy, being emotional, body not being exactly like it was before, and just the trauma of a loss not ‚Äútainting‚Äù the forward journey. I want to TTC as soon as possible, but I want it to be sexy again, not just my husband feeling like I‚Äôm using him for his sperm.

<p><strong>Please share positive pregnancy tests (BFPs) ONLY in this thread. Do not make a separate self-post about a BFP/subsequent pregnancy or post about it in the TTC daily thread.</strong> </p>

<p>The purpose of this weekly post is so users can easily get an update on others&#39; results. Also, as our Alumni move on to <a href=""/r/PregnancyAfterLoss"">r/PregnancyAfterLoss</a>, you can know who may be moving and keep track of them if you wish.</p>

Four miscarriages in the last year. Three have been back-to-back cycles without a period inbetween. CP, then the three were 6w, 8w, 6w. I tested 8w and trisomy 16 (blighted ovum/d&c). The others all miscarried naturally. 

I haven‚Äôt done any extra testing yet. Planning to do RPL bloodwork this week. I have one 2 year old son. No issues with miscarriage before him. I‚Äôm torn on whether or not to skip this cycle of ttc. I‚Äôm desperate to conceive and carry to term a healthy baby. Doc says either option is fine (wait or go ahead) but that sitting this one out could save time in the long run if we find anything significant on the bloodwork that could be remedied and prevent another MC. 

Four MC in a row... do you think this really could just be bad luck? The fact that I conceived and got progressively darker tests (about 400hcg Max, stalling a few days then declining) before miscarrying, makes me think my body might be holding onto nonviable eggs.  It took me 7m to conceive my LC. No miscarriages in that period of time. Maybe my body used to be better at NOT holding onto nonviable eggs? Does that even make sense? Like my body is now dumber? üò¨üò¨ I‚Äôm almost 35 years old. Has anyone been here before and made the decision about ttc or skipping? I feel fine physically and emotionally. Normal. I really want to try again right away but am scared about not giving my body time between will someone cause an immature egg or other problems that could be avoided by waiting. But on the flip side I‚Äôm worried about missing a potentially good egg this month.

The easiest way to describe this is as a timeline so here goes:

July 28-30 - Ovulated and Conceived

Aug 10 - 10 DPO, negative test

Aug 11- 11 DPO, negative test

Aug 12- start to test but pee blood so I assume I‚Äôm starting my period. 

Aug 20- start OPK and my LH is SKY HIGH

Aug 21-23 - continue to get early and abnormally high OPK tests, 4 days before normal ovulation

Aug 24 - Take a pregnancy test and get a BFP!!!!!

Aug 25 - happen to be going to dr for another matter so she does a blood test - positively pregnant! Yay! (HcG at 373)

Sept 11- First prenatal appointment, approx 6 weeks since last ovulation, dr cannot find the pregnancy. 

Sept 11- blood test to check HcG (came back 208)

Sept 14- blood test to check HcG (came back 210) 

Sept 15 - Dr orders emergency ultrasound to check for ectopic pregnancy. None found, no pregnancy of any kind found. 

Sept 16 - Dr orders a dose of Methotrexate to stop cells from dividing and help my body get rid of what‚Äôs left of an unsuccessful pregnancy. I cramp lightly and bleed that night.
 
Sept 18 - Blood test to check HcG (STILL 210).

A week after I gave birth to our stillborn son, my doctor said she usually recommends an 18-month interval between pregnancies.  More than two years before I'd have another baby. My heart sank even deeper than it already was.  It felt like oxygen was pointless.  I felt like there was no way I'd survive that long.  I refused to accept that answer.  I needed hope. And I began my research that night.  My Postpartum visit was two weeks ago, at 7w PP, and I shared what I found with my doctor, and she read them and said ""Ok.  Given these findings, you can start trying whenever you feel ready.""  (I had a tear and am still healing.)

The study was published in the Lancet in 2019, and studied the birth outcomes of over 14,000 pregnancies following a stillbirth. I'm not a MD so I don't feel it's right for me to post my or my doctor's interpretation of the findings here - you'll have to read the study and make your own conclusions. But bottom line is that your postpartum journey is unique, and your recovery is unique - both physical and emotional.  And if you don't want to wait, you can push for the tests to check to see if you're physically ready.  I had the gamut the day I left the hospital and had the all clear, but as a precaution I'm getting them done again tomorrow.  

Direct quote from the study: ""Conception within 12 months of a stillbirth was common and was not associated with increased risk of adverse outcomes in the subsequent pregnancy.

I told my sister in law I was NTNP and she got so excited she Amazon'd me 25 internet cheapie HCG tests. ""Why the hell would I need this many tests?!"" I so naively wondered. 

I'm almost ashamed to admit I got pregnant on my 3rd cycle of NTNP. I didn't think it'd happen so fast and didn't end up testing until 3 days after my missed period... I was still figuring out my cycle after getting my IUD out. I was so excited I told all my family. At 10weeks I started cramping and spotting. Thanks to COVID I had to go to my ultrasound alone only to discover my pregnancy was not viable. I was so embarrassed that I had told so many people- I guess now I had some phone calls to make. 

I took a few days off of work and on my first day back, a pregnant coworker of mine was talking about how she got her OB office to change the policy so her husband was allowed at her ultrasounds. I had to fight so hard to hold back the tears- I wanted to tell everyone that I just found out I miscarried by myself and to stfu. Instead of being happy for this woman I still hate her. 

I opted to medically manage my MC with Miso. I bled moderate to heavy for a couple weeks and spotted for another couple of weeks. My OB had me doing serial HCGs and it took 6 weeks to be ""not pregnant."" Why had no one told me my miscarriage was going to last 6 weeks?? I thought a MC was something that happened one day and then was over. My OB kept reminding me to was to TTC until I had a normal period. I was spotting forever and didn't even know what that meant. 

I began doing research. I joined all the ttc groups on reddit, borrowed TCOYF from the library, googled all the things. I ordered a bunch of OPKs and a BBT. I downloaded about four different fertility/tracking apps. This is where things began to take a turn for the worse. I wanted to start TTC right away. I began tracking my cycles in detail, all of my symptoms, my CM, my temps. What I thought would be helpful has now become an obsession.

The first thing I think of when I wake up is reaching for my thermometer. I open all of my fertility apps multiple times a day. During my TTW I start peeing on HCGs at 7dpo and have no self control. I spend hours scrolling through line porn seeing positive at 8/9dpo that give me unrealistic expectations. I nit pick my chart and continuously compare it to others instead of using it as a helpful tool. I have peed on well over a hundred HCG strips.

Today (12dpo) AF came after I had confirmed ovulation and had sex on all the right days. I knew by my cramps at 10dpo that I was out. I never remember being this emotional during my period but all I want to do is cry. 

I want to go back in time to my naive, care free NTNP days. How did I go from ""If it happens, it happens"" to ""I need a baby NOW""??? TTC consumes my every thought. 

I spent my whole life ""waiting for the right time to get pregnant."" I'm 30. I've been at my career level job for 5 years. I quit smoking cigarettes cold turkey 2 weeks before getting my IUD out and have stayed strong. I also quit smoking weed. My partner and I have worked through some serious relationship issues these last couple of years. I've finally built a decent savings. I have a room perfect for a nursery. And now I just wish I wouldn't have waited so long. 

Part of me wants to just stop everything. Stop the temping. Throw away the OPKs. Just say fuck it all- I am no longer in a healthy place emotionally, if you can't already tell. A small part of me want to go buy some joints from the weed store and pick up a pack of smokes on the way home.

280,2048,confidence,<praw.reddit.Reddit object at 0x7f12a630cd90>,,ttcafterloss,"I'm recovering from an IVF mc from my first round and last night I dreamt that I woke up and opened the curtains and across the road from me was a building under construction. 

The roof wasn't done yet and it looked like a brick house except it was the most gigantic house ever built, massive like the pyramids but just a common red brick construction.

I was really curious about this building springing up overnight and said to my husband ""wow look at this! I am going to investigate and find out what it is.""

So I approached the building and saw it was a public building and a builder said it was going to be internationally famous when completed and already open to the public. Indeed there were Japanese tourists and all kinds of people walking around. It was pretty much empty and nothing to get excited about.

I wanted to know more and found a plaque that said the building was to be an international mourning centre for anyone to visit and grieve the loss of a loved one. I was very touched at this.

Then I noticed out back, a beautiful and small stream flowing with lovely green plants. I was worried that the building construction would mean it would have to be filled in and destroyed and this concerned me greatly so I tried to find a builder to ask if the stream could be diverted through the building and made into a feature, to save the frogs, newts and dragonflies.

I woke up realising I have been keeping my grief to myself, only occasionally becoming overwhelmed and crying. I admitted to my husband that and he said he had felt a little the same.

I think the international centre of mourning is my way of wanting to connect with others who are grieving like me. A building that looks very much like a large home is that feeling of safety and security that I always crave. 

The stream and the small animals that I was worried about being destroyed i suppose might be that little life I nurtured thst was precious to me, no matter how small it was and I wanted to protect it and acknowledge it.

I wanted to share this with you. My heart needs me to acknowledge my loss and share my grief with others. Recognise the beauty and fragility of life.

<p>The roof wasn&#39;t done yet and it looked like a brick house except it was the most gigantic house ever built, massive like the pyramids but just a common red brick construction.</p>

<p>I was really curious about this building springing up overnight and said to my husband &quot;wow look at this! I am going to investigate and find out what it is.&quot;</p>

<p>So I approached the building and saw it was a public building and a builder said it was going to be internationally famous when completed and already open to the public. Indeed there were Japanese tourists and all kinds of people walking around. It was pretty much empty and nothing to get excited about.</p>

<p>I wanted to know more and found a plaque that said the building was to be an international mourning centre for anyone to visit and grieve the loss of a loved one. I was very touched at this.</p>

<p>Then I noticed out back, a beautiful and small stream flowing with lovely green plants. I was worried that the building construction would mean it would have to be filled in and destroyed and this concerned me greatly so I tried to find a builder to ask if the stream could be diverted through the building and made into a feature, to save the frogs, newts and dragonflies.</p>

So here I go again in my two week wait. I hate taking hpts at this point. My anxiety sky rockets, and because I have always gotten a positive at 9dpo each time I have been pregnant I automatically think I'm out if I test that day and it's negative. 

I wish I could be one of those women who can wait until they miss their period but I couldn't even if I wanted to. My ob has special instructions as soon as I get an positive I have to call her office, do blood work (most likely because they think I will need synthroid right away as my tsh is borderline), get progesterone, and baby aspirin. So of course I will test before the weekend so that I can actually call her office before they are out for the weekend. 

So of course I'm 9dpo next Wednesday...so let's ruin my weekend with a negative test (cause I'm so negative at this point), followed by me wishfully thinking it will turn positive. [my chart](https://i.imgur.com/MbKkLWr.png)

Finally had imaging - nope, just the fibroid, but the fibroid did extend into the uterus cavity and we scheduled it for removal because it's location could be problematic for TTC or carrying. That whole thing became another pain in the butt to schedule, but it was finally on the books last Friday. As I understood it, it would be the last step in my return-to-TTC journey.   


When I woke up on Friday though, the OB was like ""so we got the fibroid, but I also wanted to let you know that we also found some polyps so we went ahead and removed those too, they're being sent to pathology and we'll let you know."" To say I spiraled would be an overstatement, but it got close. I just very emotionally assumed that with the string of bad luck I'd been having (and my hypothyroidism which is listed as a risk factor for basically everything bad on the internet) that there was no way those polyps weren't malignant in some way, and I was possibly looking down the road of a long, scary medical journey. I mean, who gets fibroids and simultaneous polyps at a young age?  


Got the pathology back today - not only was everything benign, the tissue WASN'T EVEN POLYPS TO BEGIN WITH! It was just ""normal proliferative endometrium"" - just a normal bump in the uterine lining for where I was in my cycle.   


This is the first time that the news I've had in this whole process has truly been a relief. I feel like I've been gifted back so much time that I was already counting as lost. I was ready to try again ASAP in April. It took nearly six months to get there. Assuming I don't sport an infection between now and next Friday - unlikely - that's *it.* It's over.

I&#39;m curious if I took a test and my level was still 7 if that would show I&#39;m pregnant even if I&#39;m not. Any insight would be appreciated!</p>

Need I say more?? Ok I will. 

Everything seems to be working against us. We were able to conceive last year after around 6 months of focused trying. We lost that pregnancy almost a year ago now and haven‚Äôt been able to conceive again yet. My cycles have gone WILD since the pregnancy. The six before it were 32, 28, 28, 28, 28, and 32 days. Since then they‚Äôve been 26, 26, 29, 31, 28, 30, 42, 29, 34, and currently 44 and counting. 

This cycle is the first one that I‚Äôve started temping and LH testing. But of course because I‚Äôm a noob at it I don‚Äôt know what I‚Äôm doing or what to believe. I had a peak LH on Aug 22 and the Femometer app told me I was about to ovulate and didn‚Äôt need to keep testing for the remainder of the month.. so I stopped. 

My temp chart is super unreliable for this month because at first I was just taking it whenever I wake up and not aiming for a certain time. (I also missed a few days) but now i have an alarm set and I check it every day at 7:30 on the dot. So based off of that, Femometer changed its mind today and now says I ovulated on Sept 12th?

So I was already in the mentality of being out for this month and just waiting for AF so we can get started again and I can be more consistent. Now we might be back in again? We did BD the night of the 13th just in case since I hasn‚Äôt stated yet and we have no idea when I actually ovulated. 

We‚Äôre also struggling with actually doing the BD part of things because husband has started having issues with low T this year. We didn‚Äôt know/have dx until last month. I just knew his sex drive was kinda gone. We don‚Äôt have any trouble once things are initiated, it‚Äôs just that he has no urge to initiate anything so we‚Äôre really only having sex right now for the sake of conception. Husband is on Clomid now and we‚Äôre hoping it will help get his T back up and we can get back to ‚Äúnormal‚Äù in a few months but right now having every other day or every third day sex all month long is not an option and pinpointing my ovulation day so we can be sure to hit it isn‚Äôt working either.

So yeah.. I‚Äôm just frustrated. And getting the switch from the app this morning making me think we‚Äôre still in the running this month really threw me for a loop and it basically triggered a lot of feelings from my miscarriage and really had me in a messed up frame of mind all day. I really like my doctor but last year when we found out we were pregnant and I scheduled my initial appointment with him they scheduled me for when I would be 13 weeks along already. And I miscarried on the day before my appointment. So I made it through the whole first trimester but I never got to hear a heartbeat or see an ultrasound or anything before our loss. I have nothing to show I was ever pregnant to begin with other than a couple of pictures of my bump and a picture of a positive pregnancy test. What if there was something that was wrong that they could have caught during a first trimester visit and fixed to prevent that loss? (Like progesterone levels of something)
I‚Äôm so scared this is going to happen again. I‚Äôm scared to change doctors and end up with someone I don‚Äôt like or trust and I‚Äôm scared to stay with a doctor who may not be able to meet my needs.

314,2048,confidence,<praw.reddit.Reddit object at 0x7f12a630cd90>,,ttcafterloss,"So...I'm back. In 2016 I lost my first pregnancy at 13 weeks on August 31st and we buried her on September 9th. That was an MMC after a textbook perfect scan at 8 weeks; we decided not to pursue genetic testing, so it will remain forever unexplained. 

This year, after battling secondary infertility and several bad doctors, we finally got our third pregnancy! Yay! ...until I started spotting brown blood all day on September 8th at (almost) 9 weeks. The newest doctor blew me off at first but after getting a second opinion and pestering the crap out of the nurses, I got a scan set up for September 9th - only to learn the pregnancy we had fought so hard for was ectopic. 

I still hadn't felt anything unusual outside of the brown spotting, so I had high hopes that it could be treated with medication. But first the OB had to go to lunch, then she had a surgery, then the office got backed way up...I finally saw her after waiting around in the building for nearly 4 hours after the scan aaaaaaaand wouldn't you know it, my tube gave in and ruptured literally as they were finally getting me back to an exam room. As in, I collapsed in sudden extreme pain and my husband had to pick me up off the floor and put me in a wheelchair to get rushed to the OR. 

Now, I will say the OB nurse who pushed me to the OR was amazing. The OR tried to push me back to the ER, said I couldn't come in without COVID testing that took a minimum of an hour, etc. and this nurse had my back the entire time.

In 2016 I lost my first pregnancy at 13 weeks on August 31st and we buried her on September 9th. That was an MMC after a textbook perfect scan at 8 weeks; we decided not to pursue genetic testing, so it will remain forever unexplained. </p>

<p>This year, after battling secondary infertility and several bad doctors, we finally got our third pregnancy! Yay! ...until I started spotting brown blood all day on September 8th at (almost) 9 weeks. The newest doctor blew me off at first but after getting a second opinion and pestering the crap out of the nurses, I got a scan set up for September 9th - only to learn the pregnancy we had fought so hard for was ectopic. </p>

<p>I still hadn&#39;t felt anything unusual outside of the brown spotting, so I had high hopes that it could be treated with medication. But first the OB had to go to lunch, then she had a surgery, then the office got backed way up...I finally saw her after waiting around in the building for nearly 4 hours after the scan aaaaaaaand wouldn&#39;t you know it, my tube gave in and ruptured literally as they were finally getting me back to an exam room. As in, I collapsed in sudden extreme pain and my husband had to pick me up off the floor and put me in a wheelchair to get rushed to the OR. </p>

<p>Now, I will say the OB nurse who pushed me to the OR was amazing. The OR tried to push me back to the ER, said I couldn&#39;t come in without COVID testing that took a minimum of an hour, etc. and this nurse had my back the entire time. She stood there and personally called practically every department in that hospital to get me labeled emergency enough to skip all the red tape.
