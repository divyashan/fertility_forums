I have never been surrounded by such a loving group of women (and men) and wanted to thank you all so much for welcoming me with open arms.

My husband is in the last month of college and constantly thinking about a baby (and losing two) has really taken a toll on our marriage. To be honest, we've been trying since the night we got married and have never taken the time to just be with each other or be happy with the person we each married; feeling like they are enough and our family is complete. So that's what these next two or three or four months are going to be about. I'm ditching it all and just setting an alarm on my phone for when my next period is due (so I don't ruin another set of sheets or cute pair of underwear, damn it). 

We've really been trying to throw our life into a healthier direction, but my stress alone isn't helping. I want to get back into reading, sewing, cooking, and maybe discover some new hobbies. Taking TTC off my plate opens up a vast new area for me to focus on and as heartbroken as I am to leave you guys (and believe me, I was crying about it earlier today), I think I need to refocus my life right now. And there's some relief in that...no more pressure to temp or chart or pee on sticks or pay attention to symptoms...I can just live my life and stop worrying that I'm constantly messing it up by doing something wrong.

Anyway, this is getting sort of long, but I just wanted to say TTFN (ta-ta for now) and that I love each and every one of you so incredibly much.

Your support has meant everything to me over the last few weeks, and I am so, so grateful for this sub.  Since I don't know which thread this should go in, I am making my own.  

I went in today for my appointment to receive the medication to initiate my miscarriage after blighted ovum diagnosis last week.  Last week, just a gestational sac was found, no fetal pole or yolk sac.  

Today I saw a different doctor, since I was supposed to be part of this research study thing.  She did an ultrasound to confirm there is no viability before giving me the medication.  She was very quiet while doing the scan.  I assumed that meant everything was more or less the same.  At one point, she said ""Did they find a yolk sac last week?"" and I told her no, they did not.  She didn't say anything, just kept clicking around, printed a few images.  At last, she took the wand out, and said her findings were inconsistent with last week's scan.  Today she found a yolk sac and a 2 mm fetal pole.  There was no heartbeat, but she said it looked like a normal pregnancy at 6 week 2 days, so given that, she obviously won't give me the medication. 

Which would be great news, except it doesn't add up at all because

1) I was tracking ovulation with temping and OPKs, clearly pinpointed my ovulation date, and should be 8 weeks pregnant now

2) Even if my charting was completely wrong, I got my first positive pregnancy test almost 5 weeks ago, on March 7

3) My HCG beta two weeks ago was over 25,000 - way too high if I was only 4 weeks at that time

I don't know what to think.  I am trying really hard not to let myself feel hopeful.  Given my points above, it seems impossible I could be 6 weeks pregnant now.  But at the same time, it seems like it has to be a good sign if there has been growth and development in the last week! 

Damnit, I feel like I am going insane.  Can anyone make sense of this?  Ever heard of anything so crazy?  I am going to be in limbo for yet another week, then go in for another ultrasound.  At that point there should DEFINITELY be a heartbeat if there is any chance of viability.  I really don't think this is going to work out, and just feel like this is a long, drawn out, really mean joke.  But ah, what if????

I hope this doesn't seem like drama or attention mongering; I really just need to vent about this to people who will understand, and I'm too ashamed to talk about it further with anyone IRL.

One day when I was pregnant with what would turn out to be my second loss, I got an email that brought up a lot of negative emotions from a trauma in my past. I did what I could to mitigate the damage, but that night, I couldn't stop thinking about it and ended up having a panic attack. During the panic attack, I had some mild contractions and started freaking out that I was having a miscarriage. I was then panicking about the panic attack (yay, panic snowball) and thinking how awful it was that trauma from so long ago was going to rob me of my baby, in addition to everything else it had already taken from me. My body felt so heavy, and I had the worst, darkest, cold-burning, empty feeling in my abdomen (sorry, it's hard to describe). I was finally able to settle down and fall asleep around 3 am and then felt mostly okay the next day.

At the scan where we found out the baby was dead, they told me approximately how far along he/she had developed. When I counted back the days, it turned out to be either exactly or just after the time of my panic attack. Of course my mind jumped to my panic attack as the cause of the miscarriage. I feel like if I were more ""put together"" as a person, maybe this would never have happened. Maybe if I weren't so weak, my baby would still be here. What if I get pregnant again and then something else makes me panic and that baby dies too?

Of course my doctor has assured me that my panic attack could not have caused my miscarriage. And as DH said to me, if all it took to end a pregnancy was panicking about things, the human race would never have survived, and undesired pregnancies would never be an issue.

I still can't help but wonder, though.

**[My Chart](http://tinypic.com/r/2mrrxgk/8)**


Hello! I am new here. I’ve been lurking around everywhere lately and finally decided to post. This whole experience can be a pretty lonely and depressing one and I don’t think anyone can really understand the extreme amounts of mental and emotional stress one goes through unless they go through it themselves. Company/Advice would be awesome!

A little about me: I’m turning 26 this year. My husband is 24. I was diagnosed with PCOS when I was 13 after dealing with extremely bad medical issues due to my insulin being out of check for a long time. I was told last year that with my blood sugar rising and crashing the way it does if I do not get myself in check I would die by 40. My ovaries were 4 times and 5 times (R and L side) bigger than they should be with massive cysts. I did not ovulate except for once a year and did not have periods. 
Since then I have gone from 280 to 170 lbs (I have gained 20 lbs since Christmas so now I'm 190 ): ) doing the low carb/keto diet. All of my blood panels have come back really good. I have been regular for 6 months now!

My losses: When I was 21 I lost a bunch of weight (270 down to 150) and got my PCOS under control. I began to have normal periods. This is when I met my husband and we ended up accidently getting pregnant thinking that I couldn’t. We were ecstatic knowing this may be my only chance to have a baby. I ended up miscarrying (very heavily and very badly at the ER) the day after I got my BFP (what a kick in the balls). That one almost killed me because my sister in law was born the month I miscarried and I ended up being her temporary care giver. Being in a bad place with my own mother and watching a newborn, Mother’s Day that year was the most alone and emotionally fucked up I had felt in my entire life. 

My second loss happened around the time my husband’s 15 year old cousin “accidently” got pregnant because she found out her BF was cheating on her and didn't want to lose him(I think if there is a God he is fucking with me hard). I was not around for her son’s birth (though I saw photos on FB) and thank goodness for that because I do not think mentally I could have handled it. 

My third loss happened in the middle of my 12 hour shift at work while I was lifting a patient. That was by far the most physically painful loss. I did not know I was pregnant at the time so it wasn’t as bad as the first two.

My most recent loss happened this January. This one nearly broke my heart completely in two. My husband and I have been waiting (im)patiently for a little one for five years now. We have a parenting plan laid out, names picked out, and everything set to go. We both want this badly. When my period became regular I was so excited to be late. I got my BFP and had all the signs. It was amazingly blissful. Since we have been working with an RE for a year now they told me immediately to get in for a blood/progesterone test (I have an extremely high miscarriage rate due to progesterone/PCOS). The day I was supposed to get my results from the blood draw I began bleeding everywhere. Literally the second I wiped I got a call from the lab and they apologized saying that I was not carrying a viable pregnancy and my levels were really low. I told them that I was bleeding and they told me when I was ready to come in and we could begin treatments. I was waiting for my insurance to kick in on the first of March.





**[If you read anything: This would be the most appreciated]** 

What’s going on now/Advice is needed: 

For 6 months now I have been regular. My average period length is 35 days. Last cycle in Feb was a little screwy due to miscarriage. Anyways, husband and I went into the RE’s office for lots of testing on 4/4. I was 4 days late. 

I told Dr I had been charting my temps. My temp dipped to 97.6 on the 27th of March (My last period was 2/23 through 2/28) but raised up to 99.5 and has been staying in the 99 range consistently high all week. I was due the 30th of March for my period and it is still not here (unless I was supposed to start later since I Oed later than I thought I was supposed to ). My face feels warm and flushed. My boobs hurt. I've been having creamy cm, small cramps. I feel like I want to throw up through the day but don't. Headaches. Hungry and thirsty and peeing a lot. I have been waking up in the middle of the night to pee and in the morning I have to go so bad it hurts. I am extremely bloated. I have been having very vivid dreams (Some zombie dreams/some pregnancy dreams. Last night I kept dreaming that I kept touching my bump and feeling the hard part where baby was) 

Well, first they tested husband (which was a hilarious experience) and told us that his sperm count was 130 mil and mobility was 69%. They said this was really good because they want the numbers to be at least 20 mil and 50%. Next they did my ultrasound. She told me that my ovaries have shrunk (though were a little enlarged still) and I did not have any major cysts. She told me that my lining was very thick. With me only being 4 days late that could be a good sign. She told me if I do not start by the 16th they want me to come in for provera and we will go the femara (Clomid overstimulated my ovaries last time I tried it) route and I will have to inject myself with ovidrel. She ushered me off to get bloods done. 

They called me yesterday with my blood results. They told me that my progesterone was lvl 11 (I took the blood test within an hour of eating and I heard that could make your levels go down by 50%) and my blood work shows that I definitely ovulated by myself this month! I tested at 1 day late BFN and then again at 4 days late BFN. I’m not sure I can mentally handle another loss (especially with three of my sister in laws currently being pregnant and the family buzzing over baby shit) and I am very scared/worried/have nobody to talk to about this. My husband wants me to be pregnant but has the mentality that I am killing myself thinking about it and I’m either pregnant or not so why think about it? But ladies, **IT’s ALL I CAN DO**. I don’t think anyone understands that like someone who is TTCing with fertility problems does. 

Anyways, I am confused.  Am I feeling PMS and not pregnancy symptoms? Is that progesterone and thick lining and the temps normal to be that high before period or is there any kind of chance this could be my cycle? This is all I have been thinking about because I am impatient and just want to know right now. I know once I find out I am all I will worry about is losing it and not getting progesterone fast enough. But, my levels have never been that high and we have never caught my ovulation with my RE like this before so of course I am all spazzing out.

It’s great to meet you all! If anyone needs to vent/wants support I would love to help as well!

57,2048,confidence,<praw.reddit.Reddit object at 0x7f12a630cd90>,,ttcafterloss,"I want to start off with a trigger warning. This post will mention pregnancy after loss and a few things about pregnancy/baby preparations. That said, I still think that those who are still TTC may have good insight, so if you are able to read on, I would love to know what you think. If not, I totally get it. And if it shouldn't go here, I understand, but we've all had the conversation about how TTCAfterloss doesn't exactly stop with the positive test.

Okay, here we go. I posted on the alumni thread about how I'm struggling with having in-laws. I don't know how to have or be an in-law. Sometimes I barely know how to people because I'm pretty introverted. But it's more than that. Let me explain.

I don't really like my in-laws much. There, I said it. They have no boundaries with my husband or each other. They are willfully ignorant and being in public with them makes me want to crawl into a hole. For example, last year on Father's Day, we had a picnic at a local park. At this picnic, my mother in law made a joke about @bortion that I won't even repeat here because it was so awful. On Father's Day. At a park. My brother in law emotionally abuses his children. As a licensed teacher, I can only see so much before I'm obligated to report and I've warned my husband about that. My father in law has used the word ""tits"" in reference to my breasts before. 

Let's just say it isn't easy. My mom thinks they aren't that smart but I don't see it that way. I think it's ignorance and lack of social skills.

That said, here's what's going on. Ever since we found out about this pregnancy, it's been one inappropriate comment after another from my father in law and many of them occur on Facebook. It's to the point that I want to deactivate Facebook because I can't handle this. Initially, he was talking with my sister in law about HER having another baby but brought me into the conversation by saying I needed to ""hurry up"" and produce some grandchildren. Needless to say, I was pretty upset. I already knew about this pregnancy, but we hadn't gone public yet and I was still pretty early on and terrified of a miscarriage. But I tried to let it go. I hate Facebook drama and keep all posts pretty light and uncontroversial because of that fact.

Cut to today. I posted about maternity shopping with two of my friends. They had looked at baby clothes while I shopped. It was fun. It was good for me. It was a day that I was positive and happy and not sitting on the couch ticking off the ways I could still lose this baby. The post kind of blew up with advice from other moms about where to shop and then my sister in law popped up and offered to let me go through her maternity stash and borrow some stuff. It was all very lighthearted. My father in law pops up and again starts talking about how my sister in law needs to have another baby and THEN goes on to say that I would need maternity clothes next year, too, implying that I needed to hurry up and have another baby fast. As in, in addition to this one.

So I was upset. I recognize that I'm probably extra sensitive right now. But then he didn't stop. My phone is blowing up from notifications on this post, so I texted my husband to vent. My husband got upset and jumped in to tell his dad to shut up and that ""we're not breeder cows."" (Okay, that comment was pretty funny.) They ended up arguing. On Facebook. For a bit. It comes down to my father in law thinking that he's joking, telling my husband to ""pull the stick out of (his) ass,"" and that he was only making ""harmless"" comments.

I'm sorry, but it's not harmless. It's incredibly hurtful. Ignoring the implication that my only worth as a woman is tied up in my ability to reproduce, he acts like we haven't *tried*. We lost two babies in a year AND I got the pleasure of having a fallopian tube carved out. I don't even know if this baby will survive, despite all my hopes. Things could still happen. I guess I just feel like it's not cute, it's not funny, it's not a joke. We've been through hell to get here. And assuming we do get to bring home a baby, I'm not sure when or if we'll be ready to go through hell again. Or if it will be possible. I still have endometriosis and Factor V Leiden and one tube. And I have limited emotional capacity to continue. I'd like to think that if we only have one biological child, I still have a purpose in life and that I'm still a woman. I have a lot to offer outside of my somewhat damaged and diseased reproductive system.

And this man refuses to see that what he's saying and doing is *hurtful*. He refuses to apologize. It's like my lost babies don't matter and we just need to move on and make more. I know it's hard for people to understand that pregnancy after loss doesn't cure all of the grief and sadness about losses if they haven't been there. It's even harder if those people are emotionally inept.

So, that said, has anyone encountered similar difficulties? Am I being overly sensitive? How can I handle this without cutting off contact with my in-laws and moving to Argentina?",t2_htd07,False,,0,False,Insensitive In-laws (Possible Triggers..and Long),[],r/ttcafterloss,False,0,vent,0,,,False,t3_31pibh,False,dark,1.0,,public,12,0,{},,,False,[],,False,False,,{},Vent,False,12,,False,self,False,,[],{},,,True,,1428406072.0,text,0,,,text,self.ttcafterloss,False,"<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=""md""><p>I want to start off with a trigger warning. This post will mention pregnancy after loss and a few things about pregnancy/baby preparations. That said, I still think that those who are still TTC may have good insight, so if you are able to read on, I would love to know what you think. If not, I totally get it. And if it shouldn&#39;t go here, I understand, but we&#39;ve all had the conversation about how TTCAfterloss doesn&#39;t exactly stop with the positive test.</p>

<p>Okay, here we go. I posted on the alumni thread about how I&#39;m struggling with having in-laws. I don&#39;t know how to have or be an in-law. Sometimes I barely know how to people because I&#39;m pretty introverted. But it&#39;s more than that. Let me explain.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t really like my in-laws much. There, I said it. They have no boundaries with my husband or each other. They are willfully ignorant and being in public with them makes me want to crawl into a hole. For example, last year on Father&#39;s Day, we had a picnic at a local park. At this picnic, my mother in law made a joke about @bortion that I won&#39;t even repeat here because it was so awful. On Father&#39;s Day. At a park. My brother in law emotionally abuses his children. As a licensed teacher, I can only see so much before I&#39;m obligated to report and I&#39;ve warned my husband about that. My father in law has used the word &quot;tits&quot; in reference to my breasts before. </p>

Last January 5, my first ultrasound showed my 7 week baby burger along with a subhorionic hematoma (SCH). The SCH was thrice as long as the little one. That time I had a feeling something was wrong, but the OB told me everything will be fine. 

6 days later, I had spotting. A few minutes later, the spotting became a huge gush of blood and then I knew something was really wrong. I called my OB and she told me to calm down, take some Duphaston, lie down, and go to her clinic the very next day.

The next day, January 12, the ultrasound confirmed my horror: my placenta broke at the spot where the SCH was and the fetal age showed the burger died on the night of that bleed. After that the OB told me that SCH had a 50% chance of doing damage to the pregnancy. I am a numbers kind of gal, so I wish she was just honest.

So I had a D&C on January 13, which at least went well. I  just finished the 3 month waiting period my OB recommended and we are currently NTNP. 

Well, I didn't want to go through the symptom spotting and fear by myself, so I decided to stop lurking. I'm still feeling awful since I will never look at pregnancy through innocent eyes again, but I am happy with the other aspects of my life. It's like even with everything working perfectly in my life, it will never be 100% rainbows and sunshine.

My pregnancy with DD was very difficult. At my 18 week ultrasound, right after we were told the gender, the ultrasound tech spotted a fluid filled sac on DD back. She was diagnosed with a Myelomeningocele (form of Spina Bifida). The rest of the pregnancy was filled with almost weekly ultrasounds and a couple of MRIs. At one day old, DD had spinal surgery.

My husband and decided that we were ready for baby #2 in July 2014 and had my Nexplanon implant removed. We waited until August to start trying. September rolls around and I experienced what I thought was a period. So we continue trying. On October 4th, I woke up with extreme pain on my left side. Once in the emergency room, I started bleeding. The doctor told us that I was pregnant and probably experiencing a MC. He wanted to get an ultrasound to confirm. Before the ultrasound, the tech congratulated us on the good news...I couldn't believe she had said that. The fetus could not be seen in the ultrasound and my abdominal pain was increasing exponentially. The doctors then came to the conclusion that I was having a ruptured ectopic. I rushed into the OR for an emergency salpingectomy. The surgeon told me that my left fallopian had ruptured and was too damaged for it to be repaired. He had stated that my right fallopian tube also had scarring on it.

After the ectopic, my husband and I were heartbroken. We decided that we would start trying again once my first normal period was over. This time we would be more prepared. At the end of November, I took a pregnancy test that was positive.
Because I had had the ectopic, my doctor wanted to monitor everything closely during the early stages of this pregnancy. I was going in every couple of days to have my blood drawn to see is my hCG levels were rising correctly. Everything was starting to look up for us until we had a 6 week ultrasound. The doctor could only see a gestational sac with no yolk sac. We were told that maybe our calculation of conception was off and the baby was younger. Cue the 7 week ultrasound. Everything looked exactly the same as the week before, no yolk sac, no growth. The doctor told us to come the next week for another ultrasound to confirm that I had a Blighted Ovum. I miscarried on January 7th at 8 weeks and 2 days. The miscarriage lasted for almost 2 months.

Having the second loss of a baby so soon after the first is hard. My husband supports me anyway that he can and I am so grateful for that. But I am very depressed.

For the question ""would you prefer that the daily alumni thread was eliminated and a new sub (like /pregnancyafterloss) was created?

Yes: 5/44 (11%)

In the future if the sub gets bigger and the thread starts getting too big, I think it's worth revisiting, but not right now.

In the meantime, I've sorta come up with a solution for those of you that might be bothered by seeing the alumni thread. If you use [RES](http://redditenhancementsuite.com/) you can add a filter so you won't ever see the Alumni thread on the sub. Go to your RES settings console (the little cog by the logout button in the upper-right hand corner of your screen), click ""Filters"", and under ""keywords"" click ""+filter"", add the keyword ""alumni"" and have it apply only on this sub (ttcafterloss). There are also filter options in some phone apps like Baconreader, although in that app specifically I don't think you can set it to a specific sub, so it might block any post that has the word ""alumni"" in it.

I stopped taking BC(depo shot) end of Jan and well I am kinda just waiting for my body to get back to normal. Finally, I have stopped seeing blood when I wipe, so yay on that. Maybe this means that a) I am pregnant or b) that I will be getting my period soon. I am kinda hoping for A. 

Anyway, yesterday I had a breakdown while driving home from the store. There is this girl who I am not related to, but she is the mother of my great nephew.  I used to work at a resturant with this girl when she was going to highschool with my nephew.  (I was 6 when my nephew was born, and there is a 12 yr difference between his mom and me). Anyway, she used to tell me all the time how cute my nephew was and how she wanted to date him. This is not the type of girl I would want my nephew to be dating, if ya get my drift. Anyway, they ended up dating and she got pregnant, this was like 7 years ago. So, again I normally don't have to deal with her. And the only reason we are friends on FB is becuase of my great nephew. So my mom was telling me the other day that Heather was braggin about being a good mom on FB, and how she spent $500 on food. Now, I will say that my g-nephew is a pretty awesome, well-behaved kid. I think that is all in part due to the fact that a lot of time had been spent with my sister. My sister doesn't take any crap and always demands respect. I kinda chuckled to myself about the whole $500 on food. I wouldn't brag unless I was saving $500 on my shopping trip. So I decided I needed to see this for myself, I wanted to know if it was for a week, for a month. 

So I am lurking around looking for the post and I can't find it, oh well. Instead I see this:  (on March 18th) ""Ok.... Well, since I told my grandma, the scariest part is over. Guess I will share my secret with the world now. IM HAVING A BABY!!!!!!"" Now the reason this makes me so angry is because I feel that she is completely undeserving of this pregnancy. While I would like to say she is a decent mother, I can't. Why because she has been in and out of this (what I would label an abusive relationship) for 3 years. This man that she claims loves her is the worst kind of person. He is always throwing her out when he is mad, he bad mouths my g-nephew, calls him names, etc. Just a little over a month ago she posted this:""How u gonna be so lame as to throw away my sons shoes and take his school uniforms and have the nerve to act like im supposed to give two shits what u say about anything. Everything else u did is in the ""o well"" box but when u act like a petty bitch and act against my kids there is not any comin back from that.

She already has one kid by this man, in which she lied about him being the father for the longest time.  The only reason why I feel she got pregnant was so she can keep this man, thinking that another baby will change the dynamic of the relationship. The girl smokes and drinks (while pregnant too). Can't keep a place of her own (was on section 8 housing for a year), cause she can't keep a job. And here she is pregnant with her 3rd baby. And here I am, eating healthy and exercising. Own my own home and buisness (well my husbands self-employed but I kid that I am his boss), and I loss my baby. Why in the world is this even remotely fair! What in the world did I do?

Took about six months of CD1 ""hello, today you are crying"" to get mentally stabilized.

Fall 2014 did 2 cycles of Clomid/trigger shot/IUI. All it accomplished was lots of waiting room Kindle reading.

Took some time off. Did some fun things you can't do with kids. (When they put together book of essays about adventurous things women do when they're TTC/TTCafterloss, I will read the hell out of it.)

Last month did the process/financial consult for IVF. Sticker shock. No insurance coverage, natch.

This month embarking on triple-prong Vegas odds woo-woo weirdness before dropping half our savings on IVF next month, including

- Repeat HSG
- Clomid/trigger shot/IUI
- Acupuncture

Let's see, I'm 29, we had our first loss three years ago , no reason why just there was a heart beat and than there wasn't, we found out on Dec 23rd that this was a possibility but the ultrasound the Dr was using wasn't the best so she wanted us to get a better one to make sure so we had to wait until Dec 26.......worst Christmas ever. I was 9 weeks, and it took over two months for the full miscarriage to happen after that. Traumatizing is an understatement! My Dr refused to give a D&C because I have two uteruses (uterus didelphys) and she did not have alot of experience with it, so instead of referring our case to someone who did have experience she just made me take the pill things and wait it out. It sucked. Traumatizing is an understatement. That about three months later found out I was pregnant again, next day started bleeding but levels were still rising, turns out it was probably ectopic. Again no D&C, just the injection thing.......the day before my birthday. Again worst timing ever. We spent the day at the hospital and because it was my birthday the next day we had friends coming over to celebrate, we couldn't get a hold of them to cancel so had to be all cheery and stuff while they were there (wasn't willing really to talk about it with anyone).
Anyway, after that I asked my Dr for testing, even though I hadn't had a third one and she refused, I asked if I could have this because of the two uteruses my anatomy is different I wanted to know if that could be part of the problem with carrying, she again refused so I went back to my family medical  Dr to get referred to a new Dr, I wait for over a year and finally got in to see one. Who is just plain awesome,  she actually works in the same building as my previous Dr and said she was really displeased by what had happened to me, she listened to my concerns and we are starting to do full work-ups, because of my anatomy thought the HSG test would be both extremely painful and not overly useful to the Dr so she is going to a laproscapy to get a better look, right now I'm just waiting for that to be booked. In the meantime she says I'm safe to continue trying if I'm feeling up to it. So we are kind of trying but not overly focusing on it until all the testing is done.

So my husband and I have been trying for what seems like forever and I just found out that I'm going to have ANOTHER chemical pregnancy. After all this work...three chemicals later...I'm here. I'm happy to have found such a great community, though.

So my question is a sensitive one that I don't dare ask my husband. We've been together for nearly 10 years, dated in high school. Anyway, before we started dating, he had two one-night stands with this chick (she was one of my good friends, but really took advantage of him because he had just gotten out of an abusive relationship and was pretty vulnerable). He wore a condom both times, but I remember her bragging to me that she bit a hole in it while giving him a blow job. 

A month goes by and she excitedly told everyone **except for him** that she was pregnant and that she was so excited to get married because they had taken each other's virginities. Then, out of the blue, she said she miscarried the baby. He had no idea about this entire thing until after about three years of us dating when I brought up how stupid that was.

Here's my question: What if she wasn't doing that for attention and she really was pregnant? What if my husband has shittyass sperm that self-terminate? What if it's not me?

With 3 of them under my belt in 10 months, I almost think it's unfair that I can't share what I'm going through publicly. If I fell and broke something and needed surgery for it, or had a stroke or car accident, there would be no feeling that I had to ""hide"" and suffer on my own. Things could be posted on social media, relatives and friends could be told and pain and grieving could be shared more openly, resulting in more of a feeling of connectedness and support. 

I might just be having an emotional day, as it's currently raining and gross outside, and one week ago today I was in the OR having a d&c, but has anyone here taken a public approach to their pregnancy loss(es)? I've been thinking a lot this past week about posting (on FB) a picture of our 7-week ultrasound where we told there was no heartbeat, and saying ""this is our baby"", etc., making a statement about how many of us do go through miscarriages alone and how difficult things are to share publicly when society tells us to be quiet about such things (something to that effect)...

Now that I'm putting this into words, I'm feeling like it's sounding more and more like ""pity me, give me attention"" than anything else, and would probably just embarrass my husband and myself in the long run, as I don't necessary enjoy being the drama queen/oh-woe-is-me-type. Is this stupid and self-serving? Is there anything to be gained by going public on social media, or would it just be dooming me to months and months of awkward encounters with friends and family in the future? Thoughts?

edit: after discussion with dh, I decided to take a more subtle approach and change my profile picture to a mc awareness ribbon. Though I would really love to connect more with friends who may have gone through this, he feels like the best way for him to grieve is privately (and there's really no way that can happen if I post something public, as we share about 50% of the same friends on there). Maybe this way, the ones who truly care will take the time to look up what the ribbon means and ask me about it.

I&#39;ve been thinking a lot this past week about posting (on FB) a picture of our 7-week ultrasound where we told there was no heartbeat, and saying &quot;this is our baby&quot;, etc., making a statement about how many of us do go through miscarriages alone and how difficult things are to share publicly when society tells us to be quiet about such things (something to that effect)...</p>

<p>Now that I&#39;m putting this into words, I&#39;m feeling like it&#39;s sounding more and more like &quot;pity me, give me attention&quot; than anything else, and would probably just embarrass my husband and myself in the long run, as I don&#39;t necessary enjoy being the drama queen/oh-woe-is-me-type. Is this stupid and self-serving? Is there anything to be gained by going public on social media, or would it just be dooming me to months and months of awkward encounters with friends and family in the future? Thoughts?</p>

<p>edit: after discussion with dh, I decided to take a more subtle approach and change my profile picture to a mc awareness ribbon. Though I would really love to connect more with friends who may have gone through this, he feels like the best way for him to grieve is privately (and there&#39;s really no way that can happen if I post something public, as we share about 50% of the same friends on there). Maybe this way, the ones who truly care will take the time to look up what the ribbon means and ask me about it.</p>
