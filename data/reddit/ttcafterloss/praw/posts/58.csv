You waited years to be able to apply for your dream job. You apply, you get the job, you celebrate. Then, after 8 weeks, you find out you’ve been fired. Nobody tells you why, they just tell you to apply again, you’ll get another job. So you apply, and every month you interview. And after every interview you wait two long weeks to hear back. You weren’t hired. Again nobody tells you why. So you try something new, you change up your interview process, but still, you aren’t hired. For months.

You begin to doubt if you’ll ever get the job. You begin to doubt your interview. You begin to wonder how long it’ll be until you finally get the job. You think about whether you’re going to be fired again if you do finally get the job.

Meanwhile people are accidentally getting your dream job. Others are getting it after one, two, or three interviews. Most don’t get fired. Nobody you know has gotten fired from their first job like you.

Every few months another friend gets a job and everyone celebrates their new job. You attend big parties to celebrate someone else’s job. A job that you don’t have, and desperately want. You attend these celebrations just after finding out you were fired, after hearing you didn’t get the job you applied to this month.

With Mother’s Day tomorrow (in the US) everyone will be celebrating their job. A job you don’t have and desperately want. A job you’ve waited for, worked for, been fired from, and have yet to be hired again to do.

It’s probably not the best analogy, and I hope it doesn’t offend anyone (as you can’t be fired from being a mother), but it helped him to better understand how I feel. He’s experienced job anxiety in the past, and I think putting it in terms that he could better relate to on an anxious level helped him understand my anxiety, frustration, doubt, hopelessness etc I experience monthly.

The long and short of it? I'M NOT HAVING SURGERY!!! That ""cyst of considerable size""? Yeah it's 2.5 cm. So like an inch in size roughly. The size of a grape. Which I mean is still fairly large when considering where it's at but when I was originally told I had a cyst of considerable size I was envisioning some kind of gigantic watermelon in my belly shoving my baby making bits around. Nope just a grape.

Unfortunately there are also a bunch more , none complex cysts all over both ovaries so I now have a diagnosis of PCOS but it's a diagnosis so I'm happy. My husband and I had a moment after the doctor left when I laughed because we had no business getting pregnant so easily the 2 times we have been pregnant!! No interventions the first 2 times nothing. Yet here we are 12 months after miscarriage and 9 months of trying and nothing.

Doctor said he could do surgery and remove some of the larger more problematic looking cysts but said that would likely cause more problems than it solves so we should just leave them be as I have been largely asymptomatic but that if they become a problem we can do deal with them. 

He has started me on Leterozole to help get me pregnant and wants me to track my BBT and basically told my husband and I to screw like bunnies. We have a 3 month course of Leterozole (take on days 5-9 on my cycle) and if in 3 months we haven't gotten anywhere with getting pregnant to go back and see him and we will reevaluate. But hopefully we will be pregnant by then! He said to hop back in his office any time I have any questions, concerns or if I become pregnant and he will hop right over to me and take care of me!

Of the 32 who replied ""Yes"":

Of the 32 who replied ""No"": 

* 3 literally begged us not to allow it and to keep our sub free of current  pregnancy mentions
* 3 pointed out that pregnancies in flair would basically break Rule #5

Of the 12 who replied ""Depends"":

* All included a note that asked to keep it ""simple"", ""discreet"", or ""clinical"".
* 4 replied not to include actual EDDs, as those can be hard to see (especially if yours was the same/nearby)

**Due to these results, we will *NOT* be allowing mention of current pregnancies in flair.** 

This sub's main purpose is to support those who are grieving their loss and trying to achieve another pregnancy. Many of our users are deep in the trenches of pain surrounding their loss - either immediately after their loss, currently trying, or on a forced wait to try. Many of our users have experienced multiple losses and/or been trying for a long period of time. For these users, we want to keep TTCAL as a ""safe space"" where they can avoid pregnancy triggers as much as possible.

Many of our users are deep in the trenches of pain surrounding their loss - either immediately after their loss, currently trying, or on a forced wait to try. Many of our users have experienced multiple losses and/or been trying for a long period of time. For these users, we want to keep TTCAL as a &quot;safe space&quot; where they can avoid pregnancy triggers as much as possible.</p>

Today is the day I see the OB/GYN, who is also my surgeon to talk about what they saw in the MRI and if they have any idea what my little belly gremlin is and how serious things are, plus likely scheduling our surgical day.

I'm absolutely terrified that they are going to be able to say for sure that this is cancer because I have a little family to care for and I don't want to have to fight cancer and worry about surviving (thanks chronic anxiety!!!!). Shit I don't even want to deal with having abdominal surgery and the recovery from that since I have a 2.5 year old and he's been a huge mommas boy lately.

I want results/answers and I want progress and I want to be pregnant so desperately it's not even funny at this point, but I don't want to go under and deal with all that because I haven't had surgery since my appendix removal almost 10 years ago. 

Praying this is a simple cyst that they can just grab real easy and it hasn't compromised the ovary/tube and I can keep righty and that there is no sign of any other issues in there so they can just do the D&C and flush my tubes while in as the doctor told me in our previous appointment ""because while I already have you under and prepped for surgery I might as well do a hard reset on you reproductive system in case something happened with the miscarriage!"".

In a few hours I will be knee-deep in all my nieces and nephews (6 under the age of 3) and around all the family friends with their budding families. The downside of being the youngest sibling and TTC in your 30s is everyone around you is already popping out babies with (at least visible) ease, and you as the only couple sans kids are an easy target for *the questions*. But that's a rant for another time.

I knew this weekend would be especially rough, so I've been doing my best to lift my and hubby's spirits by:

* boxing up all the baby stuff - it's slowly grown in the last year, but putting it all in one place out of sight has been helpful
* buying a big-ass puzzle - something we can work on together and stay distracted
* having my favourite meal - we've been trying to eat better, but sometimes you just need some nasty enchiladas and refried beans
* changing my hair color - I get it professionally bleached only, so I can change the color when I gd feel like it (I use manic panic). Went for a fresh coat of deep purple this morning. Looks bitchin'
* cuddling my fur-babies - getting on the floor and playing with them, buying them special treats, getting a good dose of that unconditional-love
* setting up home 'security' cameras - we bought them planning to make it part baby monitor, but I re-purposed it into a cat camera. I can pull the streams up on my phone and see them anywhere any time. Also, you know, burglars I guess...
* having a date-day beforehand - we're leaving early for the party and going to go out for lunch and a walk around
* having an escape plan - if shit gets too real today, we can signal to each other that it's time to go
* having a plan for next time - I have an appointment with my OB to plan and get some additional testing done. She said my progesterone was low but I was already MCing when we tested, so we'll explore supplements and low-dose aspirin for next time. I feel like I'm getting ahead of it, taking control and being proactive instead of passive.

I feel for all you lovely ladies and lads here, but if something that works for me can also work for you, then job done!

On literally EVERY pregnancy forum/community you can think of, I read these posts about being more fertile after a MC... For most people it seemed to be something they had 'just heard', while others said their doctor told them this info.

Truth be told, I did see a lot of posts from women who had conceived on their first or second cycle trying after a MC... Some even without a single period in between! But the fact that there was no scientific backup bothered me, so I tried to find some studies.

Well, I couldn't find a single study that said 'you're more fertile after a miscarriage'! Every study I found said that your odds are exactly the same as before the MC. According to one study, the outcome was better for couples who started TTC within 3 months after a MC, but there is speculation that this has to do with the effect of ageing (i.e. you get older when you wait longer, fertility decreases, especially when 30+ and mostly when 35+). Some people have told me that they see it as your body being more 'willing' to conceive in the months after a MC...

I must say I'm totally biased here, though... SO and I started TTC immediately after the MC bleeding stopped. Because I temp, I could tell that I ovulated about 3 weeks post-MC, and I had high hopes of not getting my first period and jumping straight into a new pregnancy! I thought I was going to be one of these women. Especially since we had got pregnant before so quickly. Well, that didn't happen... 

And despite good timing, fertile CM, great looking charts and super regular cycles, it also didn't happen on the 2 cycles after that. I was so pissed and disappointed, especially since I've been taking vitex, maca, evening primrose oil and I just feel it has been having a positive effect on my body. Now we're on cycle 4 TTC post-MC...

With our MC, we conceived on cycle 2. Despite TTC immediately afterwards, it's already taking us twice as long. This could easily become 3 times as long (maybe even 4!) if we don't conceive this very cycle. Clearly it's just a random ballgame and we just so happened to land on our luck in cycle 2, and now it's taking longer. It really sucks when someone tells me that 'you're supposed to be more fertile after a MC'. I've read it over and over and clearly it does NOT apply to us...

Anyone else pissed at taking longer to conceive after a MC, despite all the claims that you're supposed to be more fertile? Even though you do everything to be super healthy? Even though your cycles went back to normal without issues?

It's probably just about waiting for our lucky cycle, but we do plan on getting some checks around cycle 6 to be sure there are no underlying issues this time...

**Edit: 'taking longer' is relative. I mean taking longer compared to getting pregnant before your MC. I don't mean to offend anyone, because I know that 4 cycles is nothing for those who actually struggle to conceive. It just seems long to us, because we conceived on cycle 2 before.**",t2_16efey,False,,0,False,"I'm so over ""You're more fertile after a miscarriage""",[],r/ttcafterloss,False,0,,0,,,False,t3_8gps8x,False,dark,0.93,,public,35,0,{},,8b677c92-711f-11e4-b63c-12313b0b807d,False,[],,False,False,,{},,False,35,,False,self,1525349321.0,,[],{},,True,,1525377225.0,text,0,,,text,self.ttcafterloss,True,"<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=""md""><p>After I had my miscarriage in January at 10w2d, I did some searching on how long other people were waiting and how soon they got pregnant again.

So I’m a long time lurker here and decided to finally post my intro after experiencing some serious emotional whiplash today. 

I’m recently 23, and I have a somewhat complicated situation emotionally in regards to TTC. Three years ago I was sexually assaulted and it resulted in my LC. I love her and can’t imagine life without her but sometimes having her causes some really complicated feelings regarding TTC now. 

A little over a year ago, I reconnected with a good friend from high school and we’ve been together for a year now. About a week after my LC turned 2 in August, we found out we were expecting. It was totally unplanned as we had only been together a few months. A week later at about 6.5 weeks, we lost the baby. I got some nasty commentary from my mother when I texted asking for last minute childcare to go to the ER. It was along the lines of “Nice way for the family to find out.” And his grandfather, after hearing it from his mom, decided to tell everyone and anyone who would listen, including two of my SO’s exes who have been trying to break us up since we got together because they want him back. 

About a month later, another one came out of the woodwork and decided to try to convince him she was 6 months pregnant with his baby. After repeatedly trying to weasel out of providing blood work and any other proof, she claimed she miscarried because of the stress he was causing her by asking her to provide evidence of a pregnancy. I wish I was making this up.  

After that whole ordeal, I just desperately wanted another baby. Needed one. I felt empty. My SO didn’t want to actively try, he was understandably upset and worried. We agreed on NTNP and I got a memorial tattoo as a way to feel some closure. 

At the end of January, he told me to test because he “had a gut feeling”. He was right, and we were terrified but so happy. Because we were so tentative about our excitement, we agreed that if we had a repeat loss, we’d start actively trying. And the next day I started bleeding. I fell apart. We didn’t tell anyone about this one because we didn’t want the toxic reactions again.

The due date of our first loss recently passed, on April 30th. I avoided everything baby related and I made it through the day totally unscathed. Or so I thought, until today. I got AF a few days before and today was my first day off of it. I’ve been an emotional wreck the past few hours because it hit me like a brick wall. I wanted so desperately to be pregnant again by the due date and it didn’t happen. I’m crushed. 

I don’t know why it took until today to hit me but I’m just so tired of being heartbroken. I’ve been doing everything I’m supposed to and have nothing to show for it. It feels cruel and unfair that I got a LC out of being raped but when I desperately want one with someone I love I can’t stay pregnant more than 6 weeks. 

This is my first time posting any of this anywhere and I just really felt like I needed to get it off my chest, so thank you. Any advice you have would be so very appreciated.

<p>I know that another baby won&#39;t replace my son or make things better, but I just miss the hope that was in my life when I was pregnant with my son. Someone asked me why I don&#39;t just adopt, why keep trying to get pregnant since pregnancy risks another loss. As if adoption isn&#39;t an extremely expensive option. As if being told I should &quot;just adopt&quot; doesn&#39;t make me feel like maybe I&#39;m infertile or not good enough to carry my baby. I&#39;m just sad today. I feel like each day is just a long continuation of the next with nothing to break it up. </p>

<p>I miss my son. I miss the hope and joy he brought to my life. This is just awful. </p>

I got married in early spring of 2016 and my husband and I started trying right away. By November I was feeling pretty disheartened and my doctor suggested that my weight might have something to do with my not getting pregnant as I was morbidly obese. I'd tried over the course of my entire life to lose the weight and my success was always minimal and short lived so, after many more doctor visits and psychological evaluations, I had weight loss surgery almost exactly a year after my wedding. 

The thing about the surgery, though, was it meant waiting at least a year before trying again so my body could adjust and heal. Unfortunately, at only 5 months post-op, and even though we were using protection, I got pregnant. I'm sure you can imagine my delight and my anxiety. I knew it was too early but I was determined to do whatever I had to do to nourish that baby no matter what physical discomfort I might feel.

I saw her heartbeat at 7 weeks. And I found out at 10 weeks that she'd stopped growing at 8. I was unprepared for the heartbreak I would feel. I was broken. And the worst part for me was that, despite an overwhelming urge to be pregnant again immediately, I still had to wait out my year.

Eight months have passed since my MMC and I am now over a year out from surgery. I've lost 170lbs and I'm on CD24 of my third cycle of trying again. I'm full of fears. What if I can't get pregnant again, like that nine months I spent trying before my surgery? What if I can get pregnant now but I can never properly grow a baby and I just miscarry every time? I'm having a hard time with essentially being back to square one, especially since no one knows for sure if it was my weight causing the problem. Maybe there's something wrong with my reproductive system.

\-\-\-

I knew what your name was going to be if you were a boy. I knew what  your name was going to be if you were a girl. I am still coming to grips  with the fact that I will never meet you or hold you. I won't watch you  grow up and I won't show you the way. You already found your own way  back to where you were before we met. It's a feeling of emptiness that I  never imagined I would feel. 

It has been 2 weeks and 1 day since  my emergency surgery for an ectopic pregnancy & the removal of my  right Fallopian tube. As I am typing this, a little red dotted line  appears under the word ectopic, as if google is asking me, are you sure?  Did that really happen? The word 'ectopic' means, 'in an abnormal place  or position.' I was led to believe that there was no baby. But you were  there, growing inside of me, just in the wrong place. 

2  weeks and 1 day since the scariest day of my life. In a matter of hours I  went from a place of wondering, but still knowing that something was  wrong with me, to being taken into emergency surgery. It was all a blur  but as time goes on, the memories return to me. I remember being asked  if I had any other children. No, this was the first time I had ever been  pregnant. I remember being asked if I had a living will. No, as an  otherwise healthy 25 year old, I had never pondered my own mortality so  intensely until that day. I vividly remember the way the energy shifted  in the room when the on\-call surgeon entered the room to tell me what  was going to happen. He was aggressive, and shamed me for not having  followed up on my ER visit 2 weeks prior when I was told that I had a  blighted ovum and would soon have a miscarriage. 'This could have been  avoided,' he said. Well, 'it's water under the bridge at this point,' I  thought to myself as my heart rate monitor made all sorts of crazy  sounds. I asked the surgeon if he was trying to scare me. He didn't give  that much of a response.

Luckily, I was far from alone that day.  My boyfriend and my aunt never left my side. My aunt, who is also a  nurse, was quick to alert the nurses and other staff members about the  aggressive bedside manor of the man who was about to cut into my body  and perform a lifesaving operation. My boyfriend did the same, and  eventually, not long after when we were up in pre\-op, the surgeon's  demeanor had shifted to a somewhat less intense, somewhat guilty of  terrifying this poor young woman type attitude. He asked me if I was ok  and if I needed anything. I could barely even look at him. He honestly  did scare me. I just hoped he would save my life and tried not to dwell  too much.

The story begins 4 weeks ago. I was 7 weeks  pregnant. I had been spotting brown blood for a couple weeks. From this  experience I definitely learned, the internet can be your best friend  and your worst enemy. Women have it hard. Pregnancy symptoms can be very  confusing. Pregnant women have such a protective instinct over the life  growing inside of them, that it's hard not to analyze every little  symptom. Then you start to think of yourself as a hypochondriac and you  begin this cycle of worrying and assuring yourself that everything is  fine. I think my body just knew something wasn't right. Spotting is  normal, they said. The reality is about half of the time it is, and half  of the time it ends in early pregnancy loss. 

It was late  at night, I went to the bathroom and when I wiped I saw dark red blood.  It wasn't a lot, but it was there. My heart sank and I knew something  was very wrong. I immediately started crying. My boyfriend calmed me  down and asked me if I wanted to go to the emergency room. I felt ok. I  wasn't in a lot of pain. I had been a little crampy, but once again this  can be a normal part of early pregnancy. Your body is adjusting to a  bunch of new hormones, your uterus is starting to prepare to grow, there  will be discomfort. I tried to sleep that night but probably slept for  an hour or two all together. The next morning, I told him I wanted to go  to the ER because I wasn't going to be able to sleep until I knew what  was going on. It was Easter Sunday, April 1st. My first doctor's  appointment was scheduled for just 2 days later but I knew I couldn't  wait that long. We got to the emergency room, luckily the hospital close  to my house is brand new and there was no wait. We immediately got  taken back into a room. They took a urine sample and some blood samples.  I had a pelvic exam which was very uncomfortable, and a transvaginal  ultrasound. 

When the results of the ultrasound finally  came back, the doctor came in to tell me the news. 'I'm sorry,' he  said, 'but all we can see is an empty pregnancy sac.' I was told that I  had a blighted ovum and a 'missed abort!on.' As in, there was no embryo  to begin with. Knowing what I knew from my fervent research about  miscarriage, I trusted that my body knew what it was doing and I was  bleeding because my body was preparing to pass the empty sac on its own.  The doctor said I could follow up with one of their OB's if I wanted  to. I was also told that there was a small cyst on my right ovary but it  was normal and was nothing to worry about. I knew about ectopic  pregnancies and asked the doctor if it could be the baby in the wrong  spot. He said no, it's a cyst. I even specifically asked if there was  any chance this could be an ectopic pregnancy and he said no. He seemed  surprised that I even knew what that was and I should have taken that as  a sign that he didn't know for sure. I was so down and distressed that I  just wanted to go home and grieve. I decided to allow the miscarriage  to happen naturally because it seemed like my body already knew what it  was doing. I bled for 2 weeks. It wasn't super heavy but it was  definitely there. I made sure that I wasn't 'soaking a pad every hour'  and that I didn't feel faint or any excruciating pain. As the 2 weeks  went on, my pain did increase. I had gotten used to it and couldn't  separate the increase in pain from the pain I was already experiencing. 

At  the almost 2 week mark, on Saturday the 14th, I went into what I can  only describe as a mini version of labor. I was in intense pain. My  front abdominal/uterus area was cramping intensely and my back hurt  worse than it ever had during any of my worst periods. I called my  boyfriend who wasn't home at the time and was panicking. Everything had  been so up and down during those two weeks. He tried to calm me down but  asked if I thought I needed to go back to the hospital. I honestly  didn't know. After I got off the phone with him, I was on all fours on  my bed on a towel, and my body got the urge to push. I did and the  pregnancy sac came out. It was so intense. I felt an immediate relief of  the intense, fiery pain I had been in. I thought it was over. I was  seriously relaxed for about 5 hours when I felt the pain start to  return. I knew then that something was wrong. From everything I had read  about miscarriage, it just didn't seem normal. I barely slept that  night. I woke up the next morning, on the 15th and was bleeding heavily.  Still not 'soaking a pad every hour' but it was getting there. We went  to the emergency room. This time things were different. 

I  was taken back into an exam room. My aunt met my boyfriend and I at the  hospital and sat with us while we got the same tests run again. My HCG  had dropped from around 11,000 2 weeks ago to 6,000, but it was still  elevated to have miscarried. A nurse told me kindly not to eat anything,  just incase. She was sweet about it and said that she didn't think I  would need surgery but not to eat just to be sure. My back was killing  me, as well as the front. A nurse gave me a Percocet for the pain and I  went back for another ultrasound. I knew what was going on in the back  of my mind when the ultrasound tech asked me if I was having pain in my  right side. I knew something was wrong when she ran the ultrasound  around my side near my liver. I didn't even question her because I knew  she wouldn't tell me anything and I didn't really want to hear it at  that point. 

I went back to the exam room to wait for  the results of the ultrasound. Somewhere in the midst of this, a doctor  told me I would be fine and if I wanted to eat some crackers and drink  some water I could. I think she probably got in trouble for that later  on. Haha. You have to see some humor in things, that's how we humans  cope. This is when the \*\*\*hole surgeon I mentioned earlier came in to  tell me the news. He started with 'WHAT DID THE DOCTOR TELL YOU WHEN YOU  WERE HERE LAST?!' I told him, 'he said I could follow up with an OB if I  wanted to.' 'COULD OR SHOULD,' he almost yelled. My voice trembled..as I  muttered 'could' and he went in. He told me that the baby was the size  of an orange in my right Fallopian tube. He asked me if I had any other  children and I told him this was the first time I had ever been  pregnant. He told me that he was going to have to remove my right  fallopian tube with the baby in it. I immediately went into a panic and  asked him to please not let me die. He told me that if they couldn't  remove the baby through my belly button that they would have to do a  laparotomy and I told him I didn't care as long as I didn't die. He at  least told me I wasn't going to die. 

I was 10 weeks  pregnant on the day all of this happened. Ectopics normally rupture  between week 6 and 16 so I was right there. It was very real. I've  stopped myself from wandering down the rabbit hole of what if's and  thinking of all the times when I was far away from a hospital during  this ordeal and I could have ruptured and that could have been it. I am  here, I am alive and I am breathing. I feel so lucky. So many women have  had it worse. So many women have died from ectopic ruptures. Many women  have had to have more than just a Fallopian tube removed. I am  fortunate. Before this happened, I was on the tail\-end of a 4 year  journey to health. I had lost around 60 pounds \(I told myself I wanted  to be in a normal BMI so if the day came where I was ready to start  trying to conceive I would be as healthy as possible\) and I was  extremely calm and peaceful. I wouldn't say I had 'no worries' but  relatively speaking, I did. This experience has shaken me to my core. I  had a 3 day anxiety/panic attack last week which was something I have  never experienced before. I believe it was a combination of the drugs  from surgery leaving my system, as well has having been nearly bedridden  for a month due to the 'miscarriage' and surgery and recovery and going  a bit stir crazy, as well as the obvious reality of what had happened  beginning to set in.

I feel like I was initiated into a  tribe of women who have experienced suffering and loss that can't be  fully explained, only understood with experience. We live in a world  where social media tends to show us only the pretty things, women with  successful pregnancies and sweet babies. For whatever reason, pregnancy  loss tends to be shameful and a lot of women will not speak about it  unless you share your own story with them, and then they feel safe to. I  feel fortunate that I do not have resentment within me for those who  are pregnant and those with new babies. I really understand how precious  life is, and what a miracle it is to have a safe and healthy pregnancy.  To any of my friends or family memebrs who are pregnant or expecting in  the future, please don't feel the need to hide it from me. I can handle  it. And I would love to come over and hold your sweet baby and marvel  at the wonder and beauty of life. Don't hold it against me if I can't  contain my tears, they will be happy tears and sad tears. I do not have  resentment or anger but I do have sadness. Today was my follow up  appointment from my surgery, and the waiting rooms were full of pregnant  women. There was even a woman who had just found out she had not one  but two little babies growing inside of her. Her husband and her looked  simultaneously excited and terrified. I felt for them. Those initial  fears and worries while being pregnant multiplied times two. But also  the excitement is doubled. Life is really something else. You can't  control which cards you're dealt but it's up to you what you do with  them.

So here I am, sharing my story in hopes that I  open a door or a window of communication. To anyone out there who is  going through what I went through, or anyone who has but hasn't quite  been able to put into words what they are feeling. I have promised to be  someone who will be open about my experience in hopes that I can help  someone else navigate the choppy waters of this type of experience. I am  not ashamed or scared to talk about what happened. It does bring up  emotion, but that is all a part of the process. I heal when I release  and so I will continue to let these words flow out of me and into the  collective. 

I am on a quest to restore the peace  within me. It is still there but it has become somewhat dormant amongst  all the stress of the month of April. My yoga practice went from daily  to 'I can barely touch my toes I am so stiff.' My twice\-weekly 4\+ mile  hikes that were a breeze have turned into climbing the biggest mountain  ever by simply getting out of the house and telling myself that I am not  going to die out in the middle of the woods. I am on a relaxation plan,  a plan to tune down my fight or flight system that has gone into  overdrive. I am picking up the pieces and I will be whole again soon. I  am honoring the fact that I will be stronger, more empathetic, and more  understanding. I am thankful that I have the ability to recover and I am  not faced with chronic pain that will never go away. There is so much  to be grateful for, and I am forcing myself to remember that when the  feelings of sadness or hopelessness wash up. Let the feelings surface  but do not let them linger. I am strong, I am capable, I am worthy of  feeling the peace and allowing it to overcome me like it did before.",t2_yc0a9k7,False,,0,False,Blighted ovum turned Ectopic pregnancy (very descriptive),[],r/ttcafterloss,False,0,,0,,,False,t3_8g4ei4,False,dark,1.0,,public,14,0,{},,,False,[],,False,False,,{},,False,14,,False,self,1525137178.0,,[],{},,True,,1525163897.0,text,0,,,text,self.ttcafterloss,True,"<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=""md""><p>This is copied and pasted from my blog so if it reads a bit like a story, that&#39;s why.

Knowing what I knew from my fervent research about  miscarriage, I trusted that my body knew what it was doing and I was  bleeding because my body was preparing to pass the empty sac on its own.  The doctor said I could follow up with one of their OB&#39;s if I wanted  to. I was also told that there was a small cyst on my right ovary but it  was normal and was nothing to worry about. I knew about ectopic  pregnancies and asked the doctor if it could be the baby in the wrong  spot. He said no, it&#39;s a cyst. I even specifically asked if there was  any chance this could be an ectopic pregnancy and he said no. He seemed  surprised that I even knew what that was and I should have taken that as  a sign that he didn&#39;t know for sure. I was so down and distressed that I  just wanted to go home and grieve. I decided to allow the miscarriage  to happen naturally because it seemed like my body already knew what it  was doing. I bled for 2 weeks. It wasn&#39;t super heavy but it was  definitely there. I made sure that I wasn&#39;t &#39;soaking a pad every hour&#39;  and that I didn&#39;t feel faint or any excruciating pain. As the 2 weeks  went on, my pain did increase. I had gotten used to it and couldn&#39;t  separate the increase in pain from the pain I was already experiencing. </p>

<p>At  the almost 2 week mark, on Saturday the 14th, I went into what I can  only describe as a mini version of labor. I was in intense pain. My  front abdominal/uterus area was cramping intensely and my back hurt  worse than it ever had during any of my worst periods. I called my  boyfriend who wasn&#39;t home at the time and was panicking. Everything had  been so up and down during those two weeks. He tried to calm me down but  asked if I thought I needed to go back to the hospital. I honestly  didn&#39;t know. After I got off the phone with him, I was on all fours on  my bed on a towel, and my body got the urge to push. I did and the  pregnancy sac came out. It was so intense. I felt an immediate relief of  the intense, fiery pain I had been in. I thought it was over. I was  seriously relaxed for about 5 hours when I felt the pain start to  return. I knew then that something was wrong. From everything I had read  about miscarriage, it just didn&#39;t seem normal. I barely slept that  night. I woke up the next morning, on the 15th and was bleeding heavily.  Still not &#39;soaking a pad every hour&#39; but it was getting there. We went  to the emergency room. This time things were different. </p>

<p>I  was taken back into an exam room. My aunt met my boyfriend and I at the  hospital and sat with us while we got the same tests run again. My HCG  had dropped from around 11,000 2 weeks ago to 6,000, but it was still  elevated to have miscarried. A nurse told me kindly not to eat anything,  just incase. She was sweet about it and said that she didn&#39;t think I  would need surgery but not to eat just to be sure. My back was killing  me, as well as the front. A nurse gave me a Percocet for the pain and I  went back for another ultrasound. I knew what was going on in the back  of my mind when the ultrasound tech asked me if I was having pain in my  right side. I knew something was wrong when she ran the ultrasound  around my side near my liver. I didn&#39;t even question her because I knew  she wouldn&#39;t tell me anything and I didn&#39;t really want to hear it at  that point. </p>

<p>I went back to the exam room to wait for  the results of the ultrasound. Somewhere in the midst of this, a doctor  told me I would be fine and if I wanted to eat some crackers and drink  some water I could. I think she probably got in trouble for that later  on. Haha. You have to see some humor in things, that&#39;s how we humans  cope. This is when the ***hole surgeon I mentioned earlier came in to  tell me the news. He started with &#39;WHAT DID THE DOCTOR TELL YOU WHEN YOU  WERE HERE LAST?!&#39; I told him, &#39;he said I could follow up with an OB if I  wanted to.&#39; &#39;COULD OR SHOULD,&#39; he almost yelled. My voice trembled..as I  muttered &#39;could&#39; and he went in. He told me that the baby was the size  of an orange in my right Fallopian tube. He asked me if I had any other  children and I told him this was the first time I had ever been  pregnant. He told me that he was going to have to remove my right  fallopian tube with the baby in it. I immediately went into a panic and  asked him to please not let me die. He told me that if they couldn&#39;t  remove the baby through my belly button that they would have to do a  laparotomy and I told him I didn&#39;t care as long as I didn&#39;t die. He at  least told me I wasn&#39;t going to die. </p>

<p>I was 10 weeks  pregnant on the day all of this happened. Ectopics normally rupture  between week 6 and 16 so I was right there. It was very real. I&#39;ve  stopped myself from wandering down the rabbit hole of what if&#39;s and  thinking of all the times when I was far away from a hospital during  this ordeal and I could have ruptured and that could have been it. I am  here, I am alive and I am breathing. I feel so lucky. So many women have  had it worse. So many women have died from ectopic ruptures. Many women  have had to have more than just a Fallopian tube removed. I am  fortunate. Before this happened, I was on the tail-end of a 4 year  journey to health. I had lost around 60 pounds (I told myself I wanted  to be in a normal BMI so if the day came where I was ready to start  trying to conceive I would be as healthy as possible) and I was  extremely calm and peaceful. I wouldn&#39;t say I had &#39;no worries&#39; but  relatively speaking, I did. This experience has shaken me to my core. I  had a 3 day anxiety/panic attack last week which was something I have  never experienced before. I believe it was a combination of the drugs  from surgery leaving my system, as well has having been nearly bedridden  for a month due to the &#39;miscarriage&#39; and surgery and recovery and going  a bit stir crazy, as well as the obvious reality of what had happened  beginning to set in.</p>

<p>I feel like I was initiated into a  tribe of women who have experienced suffering and loss that can&#39;t be  fully explained, only understood with experience. We live in a world  where social media tends to show us only the pretty things, women with  successful pregnancies and sweet babies. For whatever reason, pregnancy  loss tends to be shameful and a lot of women will not speak about it  unless you share your own story with them, and then they feel safe to. I  feel fortunate that I do not have resentment within me for those who  are pregnant and those with new babies. I really understand how precious  life is, and what a miracle it is to have a safe and healthy pregnancy.  To any of my friends or family memebrs who are pregnant or expecting in  the future, please don&#39;t feel the need to hide it from me. I can handle  it. And I would love to come over and hold your sweet baby and marvel  at the wonder and beauty of life. Don&#39;t hold it against me if I can&#39;t  contain my tears, they will be happy tears and sad tears. I do not have  resentment or anger but I do have sadness. Today was my follow up  appointment from my surgery, and the waiting rooms were full of pregnant  women. There was even a woman who had just found out she had not one  but two little babies growing inside of her. Her husband and her looked  simultaneously excited and terrified. I felt for them. Those initial  fears and worries while being pregnant multiplied times two. But also  the excitement is doubled. Life is really something else. You can&#39;t  control which cards you&#39;re dealt but it&#39;s up to you what you do with  them.</p>

<p>So here I am, sharing my story in hopes that I  open a door or a window of communication. To anyone out there who is  going through what I went through, or anyone who has but hasn&#39;t quite  been able to put into words what they are feeling. I have promised to be  someone who will be open about my experience in hopes that I can help  someone else navigate the choppy waters of this type of experience. I am  not ashamed or scared to talk about what happened. It does bring up  emotion, but that is all a part of the process. I heal when I release  and so I will continue to let these words flow out of me and into the  collective. </p>

<p>I am on a quest to restore the peace  within me. It is still there but it has become somewhat dormant amongst  all the stress of the month of April. My yoga practice went from daily  to &#39;I can barely touch my toes I am so stiff.&#39; My twice-weekly 4+ mile  hikes that were a breeze have turned into climbing the biggest mountain  ever by simply getting out of the house and telling myself that I am not  going to die out in the middle of the woods. I am on a relaxation plan,  a plan to tune down my fight or flight system that has gone into  overdrive. I am picking up the pieces and I will be whole again soon. I  am honoring the fact that I will be stronger, more empathetic, and more  understanding. I am thankful that I have the ability to recover and I am  not faced with chronic pain that will never go away. There is so much  to be grateful for, and I am forcing myself to remember that when the  feelings of sadness or hopelessness wash up. Let the feelings surface  but do not let them linger. I am strong, I am capable, I am worthy of  feeling the peace and allowing it to overcome me like it did before.</p>

A friend asked jokingly, ""can I keep her?"" About my daughter. My dad jokingly replied, ""sure! She can just have another."" I wish it was that easy.

So we finally had our follow up appointment after my induction back in Feb. I have linked my initial post for reference. I did also make another post after my induction. 

The doctors believe that parvovirus, which causes slapped cheek syndrome, is what killed our baby. The doctor emphasised that it’s very rare and nothing we could have done. I’ve done some quick reading around and found one journal article stating the chances of this outcome at 0.4%

All I feel right now is fury! How on earth did this happen to us after 2 previous miscarriages. WTF  😡 To know we had an otherwise healthy fetus and this is a just a series of unfortunate events is infuriating! 

I’m sure I’ll see the silver lining eventually. But the “at least” statements have been flying around and it makes me want to punch people in the face right now, my husband included. Doesn’t help that it’s CD1 😒

We have tried 6 iui's and one of which worked but sadly ended in CP. We started our very first round of IVF (in vitro fertilization) with ICSI in the beginning of January with birth control pills, following Hysteroscopy a to remove a polyp from my uterus.I started stimulating in the beginning of March with a mix of Menopur and Gonal-f for 5 days and then started ganerellix for 4 days. After that starting on progesterone suppositories 3 x a day. I produced many many eggs and the day of retrieval i felt very full. Dr said i had 28 eggs retrieved and out of all 9 were fertilized. On March 24th I had one 5 day Blast (c21) put back in.On April 1st i took an hpt and it came back positive. I was over the moon. I had my first beta on April 3rd to which it was 13, Following a second beta on April 6th at 26.I had a third beta on Monday which was 381. Wednesday i started having some gastro type pains on my left side and went in for an early ultrasound. We found what looked like two sacs or possible fluid but couldn't see any fetal development so dr drew blood and will have another us on he following Monday. My beta on Wednesday was 1104,climbing to 2220 on Friday. Monday was a gloomy day and as we walked into the ultrasound room i got a gut feeling something was terribly wrong. The whole weekend was torture for me as i bled on and off the whole time, together with raging back ache. The ultrasound showed nothing, nothing in my uterus nothing in my tubes or ovaries.At this point the Dr was sure this pregnancy was ectopic and set me up for the Methotrexate shot on Wednesday. Tuesday i was doing laundry and felt the sudden pain of gastro type pains again on my left side along with dark red blood, the pain was unbearable it felt worse then contractions and my husband rushed me to the nearest ER(my RE (reproductive endocrinologist) doesn't use this er), I had an ultrasound and was told that i had a ""sac and fetal pole"" measuring 6weeks1 day, however there was no sign of a heartbeat and it could possibly be a blood clot, I was also told there was a mass in my left ovary directly adjacent to my ovary which could be a dermoid. I chose to wait until Wednesday to see my RE (reproductive endocrinologist) and have him decide. I went alone to my visit to see the dr. This time we found a mass in my uterus which didn't look like a sac but rather fluid. We also seen a large doughnut type circle with a fetal pole and immediately dr said i need surgery right away. I rushed to the hospital and was admitted and asked to have the whole tube removed. Today I am at a loss for words. Could i have done something different? I never thought this would be the outcome of my first IVF. I am mad and sad at the same time and am scared to death to try again in fear that this will happen again.I do have one frozen embryo put away but dont know enough to determine if the one will make it past defrosting or if i should just do another fresh cycle and try to put two embryos in this time.",t2_173j0d,False,,0,False,Left tube ectopic removal on first ivf!!!why me,[],r/ttcafterloss,False,0,,0,,,False,t3_8egaq8,False,dark,0.89,,public,7,0,{},,,False,[],,False,False,,{},,False,7,,False,self,False,,[],{},,True,,1524557954.0,text,0,,,text,self.ttcafterloss,True,"<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=""md""><p>Hello everyone, I figured i share my story and try to get some of it off my chest.Me and my husband are both 30, I have two other children(11,8 but not with my husband.I have PCOS but am thin,husband has Male Factor.
