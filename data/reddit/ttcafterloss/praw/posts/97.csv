<p>What has anyone else been told/experienced?</p>

My SIL ended up having her daughter, our niece, the day before our what should have been due date. The entire pregnancy we didn’t really talk because well she happily progressed when mine ended. She wasn’t, as most aren’t, aware of the whole situation. But in the beginning we were happily pregnant together and then not. We had so many hopes and dreams. After our loss, we hardly heard from her, which is fine because I couldn’t and can’t handle the reminder. So, as our dates crept up, my husband and I planned to get away, but she had her on the 26th, exactly 4 months after our tfmr. It was terrible day for us but we made it through. We went on vacation. So now she’s home and I blocked her from Facebook and Snapchat bc I can’t handle the pictures. I want to just continue to be removed from that situation until I am ready. I just don’t want to think about them and have my pain pop up. I want to continue to heal and then address that some other times. 

Last night though, she texts me “I don’t know if you want to hear from me or not but I want you to know I’m thinking about you”

So my thoughts, just rage, and no I don’t want to hear from you, it’s why I blocked you. I want to just forget you for awhile. 

I politely thank her and let her know that obviously I’m thinking of her too(bc how can I not). 

Her next response is “I hope you’ll come see the baby soon” 

My thoughts: NO!!! Stop. Please. Why does she think this is ok? Why can’t she just see that I’m struggling and accept that ?? How can she not see that we are being tortured. We lost clara at 22.5weeks, she was suppose to be here too. This is a difficult situation because of that!!!

I have two living children from two previous FETs, and I am realizing that I was quite unprepared for the emotional/physical aftermath of losing this pregnancy at 6 weeks. We have to do IVF d/t male factor infertility, and our other two embryo transfers went so smoothly, I guess I just emotionally felt really excited and sure that this, our 3rd transfer, would work out. Logically, I know all the stats and I was always aware that we had to get through the first trimester, etc... but I'm just... shocked, and grief-stricken, and angry.

I'm noticing that I'm wracked with questions, in two areas: 1) did I cause this? and 2) what's next? When I think about this pregnancy, I review every single thing I did that was different from previous pregnancies, like taking a different prenatal vitamin, being more active (I have a 4 yo and a 1.5 yo, so life is busy and I was definitely lifting my kids and interacting with them almost normally). I took a walk outside on a really hot day, 2 days before the miscarriage happened, and maybe I didn't drink enough water that day. I stayed up late one night, caulking the tub; maybe I shouldn't have. I also had bacterial vaginosis, which was treated and resolved, but maybe that was it. Etc etc. My doctor's nurse has told me that there is no explanation, everything looked great, my numbers looked great, etc and they have given me the ""we just don't know why, a healthy pregnancy is the result of many, many just right steps and something may have just gone wrong with the development of the fetus, or perhaps it was chromosomal"" type answer. I don't have a true follow-up appt to discuss next steps with my doctor until 9/3.

Which brings me to: what's next? This was our 3rd of 4 frozen embryos. We will not be doing another egg retrieval, and have always known that these 4 embryos are it for us. So now, we have 1 left. What is likely to be the plan when I speak with my doctor? Is it recommended to try again ""soon"" after a miscarriage? For those of you who got right back up and tried again, how did you know you were ready and how did you weigh out the pros/cons? Part of me wants to do it again ASAP because the idea of living in limbo and wondering if our last embryo will work is excruciating. Some part of me really wants to either be pregnant and moving toward the goal of completing our family, or to know the outcome and close that chapter (although, that would be devestating and require a huge mental/emotional shift, so perhaps it would be best to take time to heal and be in a more resilient place, emotionally, before that possible outcome?).

42,2048,confidence,<praw.reddit.Reddit object at 0x7f12a630cd90>,,ttcafterloss,"Hi, I have a couple of questions initially posted in a different sub and received recc to share here. First, some background. I miscarried my first pregnancy naturally last month at 8 weeks, though baby only measured closer to 6 weeks. I had low progesterone (8.4 when around 5weeks) so took oral supplement from that point on for the 3 remaining weeks but of course it didn’t lead to viable pregnancy. In asking my OB what options I have to help prevent a future miscarriage due to low progesterone, she said just because my levels were low in this pregnancy does not mean they will be low in future pregnancy. Has this been true for anyone? 

She suggested I closely monitor to find out I’m pregnant even earlier and I can then get on progesterone 2-3 weeks earlier. I asked about getting on the supplement once we start TTC and she said no, not recommended because it affects dating (irregular periods, ovulation).

First, some background. I miscarried my first pregnancy naturally last month at 8 weeks, though baby only measured closer to 6 weeks. I had low progesterone (8.4 when around 5weeks) so took oral supplement from that point on for the 3 remaining weeks but of course it didn’t lead to viable pregnancy. In asking my OB what options I have to help prevent a future miscarriage due to low progesterone, she said just because my levels were low in this pregnancy does not mean they will be low in future pregnancy. Has this been true for anyone? </p>

<p>She suggested I closely monitor to find out I’m pregnant even earlier and I can then get on progesterone 2-3 weeks earlier. I asked about getting on the supplement once we start TTC and she said no, not recommended because it affects dating (irregular periods, ovulation). For those who suspected or determined low progesterone led to their miscarriage, what has been your experience and your OBs proposed solution?</p>

I need a place to write out what’s happened and get a few... opinions? Words of advice? Reassurance? Reality checks? Not sure what I’m looking for. 

I was supposed to be 7 weeks 4 days yesterday and went to my midwife for my first appointment. This is my 2nd pregnancy and we’ve only been trying since March of this year. I’ve been so sick and tired, with sore breasts almost everyday since finding out. No bleeding or cramping. I even slipped down my stairs a few days ago and have felt fine (besides a bruised tailbone) and had no cramps or bleeding after.

My midwife did a trans-vaginal ultrasound and said that there was a gestational sac and embryo but no heartbeat and I was measuring 6 weeks 2 days and the embryo most likely passed a week or so ago. She said that I may start bleeding and cramping over the weekend and if it’s more than a period in intensity I need to go to the ER. Follow up with her Monday and we’ll see if we need to do a d&c or start medication to help my uterus contract. She said that she expected me to start the natural process soon because she noticed some spotting. We are devastated- I’ve never had a confirmed miscarriage before. Spent most of the day crying and in bed. 

Today, I’m a little better. Not crying as much but still just wishing this wasn’t happening. Trying to figure out how to “wait” for my body to do what it’s supposed to. Still no cramping or bleeding. At. All. I examine the TP closely after I wipe when I have to go to the bathroom. Not even I brown or pink tinge. I still have all the pregnancy symptoms that I have had for weeks now. It’s so confusing to me.

They were going to draw my blood as procedure for a first prenatal appointment but I have really small veins and with how sick I’ve been, the nurse didn’t feel comfortable poking me to get like 5 vials of blood so they said they would wait until my next visit. This was before the ultrasound was done. I just don’t know what to expect, and I have my mom telling me to be hopeful that there could be a heartbeat on Monday. My midwife said that she has seen it happen before but she is not expecting to see anything. I have been preparing myself emotionally and mentally as much as I can for this but a part of me just can’t help but be hopeful, especially since my mother planted this idea in my head. 

I know that if I have that hope for Monday, I will be even more heartbroken when there isn’t a heartbeat. I just don’t understand why I am still having pregnancy symptoms and not bleeding or cramping at this point. There has been no sign of trouble. I’m scared to ask my midwife if I can just get my blood drawn for HCG levels so I don’t spend the weekend being hopeful. I trust her and love her. She’s a family friend and she took such good care of me and my first baby. I had preterm labor and she was amazing. I feel guilty for questioning her and her plan for me.

Hopefully this is allowed- it's more of a happy rant.

I work in data and am such a data nerd, which extends to the TTC process. Our first I didn't have much data on. After our loss, I feel more out of control of this process than ever. To try to settle my worries, and satisfy my hunger for data, I've downloaded a bunch of different TTC tracking apps, ordered more ovulatation strips than I will (hopefully) ever need, and I just bought myself a BBT thermometer!

He starts laughing, saying he's excited that I'm happy again, that peeing on sticks and tracking temperatures would of course thrill me. And it's true. The thought of getting to track all of this data and learn more about my body IS exciting to a data nerd like me. 

It's rough losing a baby. It's been a hard month of bad days and good days and tons of unresolved worries and fears and sadness. But... today. Today is a good day. Today I will laugh with my husband and agree that the silver lining will be me getting distracted by TTC data and finding my happiness in odd places like that.

I may have lost my baby, but I'm not defined by that! I'm still me. I'm just a little more weathered and worn, stronger than before. I just have to remind myself that there's more out there than my loss and there's still hope to be found, as long as I'm willing to find it!

It sucks to think I should be 34 weeks now and that I'd be meeting my daughter in only 3 weeks (would have been a planned c-section).

Even through grieving though, my husband has been desperate for a second baby. Our daughter really struck something within him and he can't wait to have a chance at being a parent. I'm obviously terrified of having a second and potentially going through this all again but I've come to the conclusion that I can't live my life without a living child of my own.

So I've been tracking Lh and BBT, mostly out of curiosity if my body is functioning correctly or not but also to know when to avoid sex. We are only using condoms -ugh- so we want to avoid fertile days as well just in case as those aren't always fool proof. 

I was so nervous that my cycle would be thrown off with the birth of my daughter. Things before her were a little wonky so I was fully expecting more of the same kind of stuff after, especially since my this period lasted 14 days.

BBT has been declining over the past few days. CM is like WOAH as well. But my Lh strips had been nothing but faint lines.

This morning though I got a huge surge in Lh on CD 22, only 2 days later than I did in December when I conceived. Correlating perfectly with the CM and BBT dropping.

I'm now feeling mixed feelings of being happy my body is back on track and being sad that I'm ovulating for nothing, just a wasted egg. It was recommended that I be on high dose folic acid anywhere from 1 month to 3 months before TTC because of my daughter's condition. I've only been taking it 2 weeks. 10 weeks is not a lot of time after what we went through but if I had taken the doses right when I got them, I'd have been on them for 2 months now and could have tried this cycle.

Just needed to bitch about being stuck in limbo. I know next month will be even more obsessive and nervewracking as we technically can begin TTC if we want to, though we may wait a little longer with the FA doses.

<p>I was shocked, terrified, and constantly sick while I was pregnant, so I didn&#39;t really enjoy it. But, God, I miss being pregnant.</p>

<p>We still live in an apartment. We bought our first credit cards when I found out I was pregnant so our credit is only &quot;okay.&quot; We can probably buy a house in a few years. But I really don&#39;t want to wait that long and it breaks my heart thinking I&#39;ll have to.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not sure how else I can relieve this urge I&#39;m feeling to procreate. I don&#39;t feel like I&#39;m still mourning or have any PTSD from the experience. I&#39;m actually less depressed than I was before the pregnancy. I&#39;m lost, here.</p>

<p>TL;DR: didn&#39;t feel ready for babies before miscarriage. Now I want a baby more than ever and I don&#39;t know how to relax</p>

The tricky part is I'm not really sure if this could have caused it. But the day before or on the same day we found out she had died, I remember me going to bed and laid down on my back. I had a sore back and wanted to straighten it out. I don't remember if I took the pillow out or not. But I remember that I felt a bit uncomfortable and tilted myself to the right (apparently the wrong side cuz the left is better). Then I remember having my cat there and maybe she was laying there partly on my, I'm not sure. Then I'm not sure if I straightened myself out again and fell asleep like that or not.

I have unfortunately experienced three loses. One at 11w6d, the next this past February was a chemical and another at 11w3d with a subchorionic hematoma. 

I have been referred to a fertility clinic. Unfortunately my cycle falls during our summer vacation. I have made appointments for my ultrasounds and will have to drive 4 hours back to the clinic to do it...and then 4 hours back.

I guess I don’t know what I want to hear, maybe it’s just a vent, but should I keep the appointment or delay until next cycle?

I feel like I’m always the one to make the sacrifices...and this is no different. Part of me just wants to enjoy summer vacation at our cottage and the other part says get it done ASAP. 😕

Any thoughts would be appreciated.

Edit:

Hi everyone!

I just thought I’d give you an update. I ended up going to do the tests. My period arrived on the monday, so I had my day three blood test done the same day as the ultrasound. 

Having them both on the same day made it easier to justify coming back. 

Tuesday evening and Wednesday morning ended up being a bit rainy as well, so I didn’t miss much. 

I had my sonohystegram on Tuesday of this week and that went well.

I've had two missed miscarriages in the last year. One  found at 10 weeks, but measuring 8, and one we discovered at 8 but measured 5. 

I've been looking into what we can change for next time as my doctor doesn't want to do testing until a third. I really want to minimize the chances of it happening again, for obvious reasons but also because I've had to have a D&C both times and am super anxious now about damage.

I had an MMC last December discovered at 8 + 6 days. I decided to have a D&C. Recovery went fine, my stomach was swollen for a couple of days but other than that it just felt like a heavy period. The following cycle in January, I definitely felt like my cervix was lower as I was using tampons, but other than that it didn’t seem like an out of ordinary period. February and March were totally normal. 

But in April, I started to spot two days before my cycle. That cycle was normal: 6 days with heavy/med/light flow. I had never had spotting before. 

May was the same. I had spotting starting 3 days before my cycle and had fewer heavy days. Then June, I started spotting 5 days before my period. The day right before my period I had no spotting but moderate cramping all day. That cycle my bleeding was significantly lighter. I had only 1 day of heavy-ish bleeding and my period only lasted 4 days. 

This month I’ve started spotting again today, cramps are starting...but no period yet. I should start within the week but I’m starting to worry. Is it possible that I have adhesions from the D&C or Ashermans that developed over time? It seems with everything I’ve read about Ashermans that most people notice an immediate difference in their cycle. Mine has very gradually become “different”.

I'm considering asking the OB for Clomid since I turned 35 in June and am ready to get this show on the road.

According to my Clue app, my cycle length is 29 days with a cycle variation of 5.5 days. Clue gave me a flag since my period length is \~12 days. I have started using Ovulation Predictor Sticks each morning about 2 days (CD 9) and have only seen negatives at this point.

Does this at all sound normal??? We had no issues conceiving, carrying, & birthing our son. We are actively trying and do the BD usually daily (we both have a high sex drives, always have), although bleeding has thrown a wrench in that, but we manage.

\-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Timeline:

2/21/20- Ultrasound to confirm pregnancy (\~8 weeks). We saw a heartbeat. Measured 2 weeks smaller (\~6 weeks) than where we were supposed to be based on my LMP.

3/5/20- Ultrasound confirmed no heartbeat. 

3/6/20- Took pill to get things moving along. Pill seemed to work and experience was (relatively) uneventful.

\~3/10/20- Went to ER due to heavy bleeding and pain in lower stomach. Ultrasound & bloodwork showed no products of conception or infection. Sent home with pain meds and told to follow up with OB. Saw her the next day and she saw via ultrasound I had not passed the sac (ER missed it, apparently). OB recommended D/C.

3/13/20- D/C surgery. No complications.

4/18/20 to 4/29/20- First ""period"" after D/C. It was very light, but otherwise no issues.

5/1/20-6/1- Had 1 day of no bleeding, then started bleeding again. This one was closer to a normal period. Light to medium flow and back to light. Lasted 12 days.

6/12/20 to 6/22/20- Started bleeding again. Aside from the length (10 days), pretty normal, perhaps lighter than normal.

6/24/20-6/30/30- Had 1 day of no bleeding and then started again. Lasted 6 days.

So I had read on a couple medical sites that the first day of bleeding (in a MC <14 weeks) is essentially CD1 and you can likely expect your period 4-6 weeks after CD1. However, I just talked to my OB’s office on the phone and she said “yeah take another HPT at home next week to see if it’s negative then.

They talk about how they don't want other people's pity, but they don't talk about what they would like people to say instead.

That got me thinking.  I haven't told many people about my loss, but everyone I have told has said the same thing, ""I'm sorry"", and it hasn't bothered me at all.  On the contrary, I appreciate their sympathy.  I forget where on Reddit I saw this explanation, but when someone says ""I'm sorry"" what they're actually saying is ""I'm sorry that you're experiencing this pain and that I can't make it better for you"".  So now that's what I hear.

I'm curious now how all of you interpret people saying ""I'm sorry"" about your loss, and does it bother you or make you feel better?  If it does bother you, what would you like people to say instead?

I am on my first cycle with progesterone supplements in the form of suppositories. My doctor's instructions are to keep taking the progesterone until one of two things happens: 1) I get my period or 2) I get a positive pregnancy test.

The issue I'm having is that I'm worried the progesterone is delaying my period. I even called my doctor's office and spoke with a nurse, and she said that no, progesterone won't do that, just keep taking it. However, I've seen contradictory information on the topic.

Would you wait, or disregard doctors advice on the assumption that 4 days is unlikely to be of any kind of clinical significance?

Long version/back story for anyone interested: I’ve had multiple rounds of chemo over the last 3 years, to treat a particularly persistent  gestational trophoblastic disease (choriocarcinoma) after a complete molar pregnancy in 2017. We were actively TTC at the time and got ‘pregnant’ first try. (I say ‘pregnant’ as there was never any embryo with a complete molar pregnancy).

If it’s relevant, I really don’t trust my doctor especially when it comes to fertility advice/preservation. If I were to get pregnant, the issue is that they wouldn’t know if it were an genuine pregnancy, or a recurrence of the choriocarcinoma (both produce HCG), and they would assume choriocarcinoma until after the 12 month mark.

I was terrified of having to do an hsg as my doctor suggested I'd do. TERRIFIED!!! 
I looked at all the research (I'm a medical student) and found that up to 97.5% of HSGs post ectopic actually come back clear/clear enough to where nothing would change in the course of action for the woman, i.e. just keep trying again.
So why in the world would I do a such terrible, painful, invasive procedure??

My cons to getting an hsg were:
Poor result yield (see above) for an extremely invasive procedure
I've had more strangers in my vagina these past few months than in the last ten years and I really didn't want another one in there 
It's extremely painful and I've only ever seen horror stories 
I'm very sensitive to pain especially in my reproductive area
Dangers of infection

The pros were:
I needed to get it done to move on into IVF.
That's it. Lol.

Well it turns out that the ultrasound you get at your ob or REs office cannot see everything in your uterus that might be helpful. These things can only be seen with more invasive imaging or advanced imaging, as for example through an HSG. 

An hsg can show you if you have a heart shaped uterus, a septum, a septate uterus, polyps, fibroids, other growths, etc. All these things will cause you to miscarry and a lot of them.can be fixed! 
If you've ever had a late term miscarriage, still birth or early labor, placenta issues such as placenta abbrevia etc, I would HIGHLY recommend for you to get an HSG done. Heart shaped uteri especially can stretch out during pregnancy so on the ultrasound they may look normal, but they're not, and they're causing circulatory problems for the baby as it grows. 
Knowing this before you get pregnant can help to prevent some of these nightmares because it will put you into the high risk pregnancy category and you'll get monitored like crazy to make sure they can get your baby out in the third trimester before anything happens to it, I.e growth issues, still birth, and late term miscarriage.

THIS was totally worth it for me to get an hsg done and sure enough, I have a heart shaped uterus.
Thank God I know this now because none of my REs or OBs ultrasounds has ever picked this up before.

Where to go in the Los Angeles area:
Dr Chin at San Fernando valley interventional radiology in Encino, California, is THE BEST DOCTOR OF ALL TIMES when it comes to hsg.
I FELT NOTHING. absolutely nothing. I still can't believe it. I'm sitting here in disbelief writing this. 
I thank him so much for putting me at ease and being so damn good at his job.

243,2048,confidence,<praw.reddit.Reddit object at 0x7f12a630cd90>,,ttcafterloss,"Before my husband and I started TTC, we both got the basic tests done (blood panels, ultrasound and SA) and we both came back normal.
So no problem, right? 

We got pregnant on our first try, and bam, ectopic. 
A pretty traumatic one at that because I knew right away something wasn't right yet the doctor didn't believe me and waited until I was almost 9 weeks (!!!!!!!!) to send me to a specialist since she couldn't find a sac or anything in my uterus or tubes and dismissed my requests for earlier ultrasounds.
The specialist found the growth in the fimbriae of my left tube right away and a few days later (!!!! Again not sure why they made me wait) I was given my first round of MTX in the cancer ward of a hospital, at an hcg of over 10,0000 (!!!! Again. Just completely shitty care. None of this should have ever happened.)
Naturally at this high of an hcg I needed a second round of MTX.
What nobody told me (again, not shocking considering the quality of my care after the fact) was that MTX kills your ovarian reserve. I had blood panels done a month before this ectopic and it was all normal, so I have a good reference point. My AMH was 2.6 and FSH was 5. Perfect!

It took almost four months for my hcg to hit 0 and I decided to stop listening to the shitty advice of my shitty doctor. I moved across the country and started supplements (yes, even folate, because, f* em, mtx is only active in your body for 7 days, thereafter you can drink booze and eat normally again and after about 30 days you can start taking folate to try to heal your body asap, it will NOT slow down your hcg breakdown, that is a complete myth after 30 days, there is zero evidence to that), working out, etc. 
What you can do to increase the hcg breakdown is to increase your liver function and cell turnover, by exercising and eating clean and feeding your damaged cells all the good nutrients they need.
Also, please go to therapy: I got post partum depression after my last MTX shot and it's extremely terrible. Yes you can get this even if you didn't actually give birth. It is causes by a sudden dramatic shift in hormones. You don't have to go through this alone. 

I changed doctors and sought out a highly regarded fertility clinic here in California to try to figure out what the hell happened and why. Both my husband and I got tested again and well wouldn't you know! 

First, my AMH was essentially killed at 0.8 now along with my AFC at a mere 4 total, and FSH at a 9 and the rest of my hormones were complete shit. I'm like a couple of months away from being premenopausal. While mtx is only active in your body for 7 days, it damages the environment for proper egg growth for at least 180 days (Stanford study) and your egg reserve and quality will be shit until after that time is over. So I got a little bit of hope here at least.

Second, my hsg came back clear. Of course. Some of the studies I waltzed through show that up to 97.5% of women with ectopics actually have clear tubes when tested after the ectopic (note, HSGs can only test for structural issues, not functional ones like issues with ciliae, that you can only assess during a lap surgery. You're not likely to have functional issues unless you also have Endo or PCOS or other medical conditions). So I started to become suspicious of why that happened to me in the first place, since I have no other medical conditions. 
All the doctors so far I had talked to said that ectopics are either just random or due to blocked tubes but that is actually only the minority of cases! The most likely and highly preventable cause is here: 

my husband got another SA but this time, an ""advanced semen analysis report"" that also looks for DNA fragmentation. This does not get picked up by a regular SA. 
And what would you know.... Turns out he has pyospermia (white blood cells in his semen) that are the cause of his high DNA fragmentation (it should be ideally less than 8%, he is at 26%. You're considered infertile at 30%). Dna fragmentation doesn't stop you from conceiving, but it does cause ectopics and miscarriages, especially missed miscarriages. 
Even when doing IVF, because unless you ask for a DNA fragmentation test, they will commonly just do a regular semen analysis where this issue won't show, and you will likely make ""normal"" embryos, because even PGS testing doesn't pick up dna fragmentation, and you will keep getting ectopics and miscarriages, wondering what the f*.
Once you know your partner has DNA fragmentation, your IVF lab can use a special procedure during ivf to sort these broken guys out, lowering your risk of ectopics/miscarriages, called PICSI/zymot or just do TESE. 
We decided on the ivf route because of our currently extremely high chance of miscarriage and ectopic and I cannot physically do another treatment for an ectopic and ruin the few eggs I have left. 
Whether or not you do IVF (because hello, cost), definitely also send your partner to a reproductive urologist to get a culture taken to cure whatever underlying inflammation there may be and check for varicoles. All this can cause DNA fragmentation, and it can be improved!

Well now you know. 
GET YOUR MALE PARTNER'S SPERM TESTED FOR DNA FRAGMENTATION!

Edit: check out r/dnafragmentation for more info!

It aggravates me to no end that fertility issues/investigations always seem to be focusing the women, as if nothing could ever be wrong with the dudes. 

Anyway, hope my experience can help someone out there, good luck and keep pushing! Don't believe what your doctor is telling you, always double check, and get second and third opinions. 

I'll do another write up of all things HSG soon. 
There aren't enough people talking about fertility issues and it's so nice to have a community to learn from and exchange knowledge and stories.

So no problem, right? </p>

<p>We got pregnant on our first try, and bam, ectopic. 
A pretty traumatic one at that because I knew right away something wasn&#39;t right yet the doctor didn&#39;t believe me and waited until I was almost 9 weeks (!!!!!!!!) to send me to a specialist since she couldn&#39;t find a sac or anything in my uterus or tubes and dismissed my requests for earlier ultrasounds.
The specialist found the growth in the fimbriae of my left tube right away and a few days later (!!!! Again not sure why they made me wait) I was given my first round of MTX in the cancer ward of a hospital, at an hcg of over 10,0000 (!!!! Again. Just completely shitty care. None of this should have ever happened.)
Naturally at this high of an hcg I needed a second round of MTX.
What nobody told me (again, not shocking considering the quality of my care after the fact) was that MTX kills your ovarian reserve. I had blood panels done a month before this ectopic and it was all normal, so I have a good reference point. My AMH was 2.6 and FSH was 5. Perfect!</p>

<p>It took almost four months for my hcg to hit 0 and I decided to stop listening to the shitty advice of my shitty doctor. I moved across the country and started supplements (yes, even folate, because, f* em, mtx is only active in your body for 7 days, thereafter you can drink booze and eat normally again and after about 30 days you can start taking folate to try to heal your body asap, it will NOT slow down your hcg breakdown, that is a complete myth after 30 days, there is zero evidence to that), working out, etc.

Both my husband and I are 34. We started TTC last June, and got pregnant by December. Not bad considering I wasn't temping/using OPKs. However, my cycle was extremely regular at 27-29 days. We had a MMC and I had a D&C in mid February.

I lost my son at 14 and 4 on June 12th, had a D&C two days later, and I've just started my first period 34 days later (32 days after the D&C). I saw some signs of ovulation at day 23, took an LH test that looked positive and so started temping that night. I saw the spike, and I'm seeing the crash now, but it's only been 10 days since I ovulated. I often spot for a few days before a period starts, but this started out as actual bleeding, though light. 

We're WTT, so it's not like I'm worried my luteal phase was too short for implantation, but did anyone else experience this after a second trimester loss? Did you even back out to closer to two weeks soon? I'm doing seed cycling to try to regulate, and supplementing with OTC topical progesterone, but I'm anxious that this loss has made my cycle wonky or permanently damaged my luteal phase length. 

Just going to add: insult to injury, this first period happened to fall just at the same week as our first real vacation in years. I have NO IDEA what to expect of it (always been a heavy bleeder), so I have approximately 80 pads of varying absorptions and sizes in a bag ready to go in the car, along with enough underwear and shorts to outfit a small army.

Everything about her, the placenta, and myself were fine outside of high BP which had started the week before she died, and was never diagnosed as preeclampsia, I was still in the hypertension range.

I was then tested for antiphospholipid syndrome, which was negative.  

My husband and I immediately started trying again as soon as my body was ready, but of course I have very little hope.  We've been trying 16 years.

So I my MMC was discovered May 5, treated with miso on May 10 and then again May 21. Was told by OB on June 3 that I had a ""very thick lining"" but that all products of conception had passed, and told to come back if I didn't get a period within 6 weeks.

June 13 I started what I thought was my period - timing made sense - but it was insanely light. Not what I expected based on OB telling me about thick lining.

I shrugged it off knowing that the first cycles can be weird, started OPKs after that wrapped up, seemed to get a totally logically timed positive OPK on CD14, and we were actively ttc.

I got my period again on July 9 (so again timing makes sense - would give me a 27 day cycle) but THIS ONE was bad. I normally have fairly uneventful and relatively pain free periods but this one was cramping, heavy (for me) bleeding, acne, headaches - blegh. So I figured OK - that has to be my first ""legit"" period then compared to the first.

That period seemed to end last Saturday. Cool. Except then I start very slight (like just when wiping only) spotting, which I've never had before post period. That continued on until last night when I'm getting ready for bed and I nearly have a freaking panic attack because I suddenly feel something passing out of me - it felt just like the m/c two months ago. I waddle to the bathroom pretty much losing it and out comes a walnut sized, red hard/rubbery gigantic lump. WHAT THE FUCK YOU GUYS. Followed by a bunch of sort of bloody mucusy discharge. I have a photo but I'll spare you that unless someone has a reason to look - but if you imagine a walnut sized model of a brain (yeah, weird) that's exactly what it looked like. It was not just a clump of tissue or a clot - it was so thick/tough that I couldn't break it apart, like a rubber ball. After considerable effort I ripped it apart and it looked like thick dark raw steak on the inside. barf.

The only plausible explanation I can think of is that I had some sort of weird stunted period that first time around, and I got a super excess of uterine lining that had been in there for some time, and it somehow combined itself into whatever came out last night. Because I had multiple transvaginal ultrasounds with the OB who said there was no products of conception left.... and I am 1000% not pregnant so anything weird like ectopic or whatever is also out.

So here I am feeling humiliated by my own dumbass body again, thinking I was on my way to getting back to normal.

All that said, I have no idea if I should be going back to OB or if I should just hope for the millionth time that this shit is finally wrapping up.

We never tried again because my period never really stabilized after my last D&C.  He never got tested on the male-end but if they ""did their job"" and you conceived, is it ever the male fault for miscarriage?

I am now in a new country, with a new partner - and oddly enough, immediately after leaving what turned into a toxic relationship after the previous losses, my cycles began like clockwork again with my new partner.  Maybe it was my body telling me something.

Anyways we got approved to try for IUI and are now at the top of the queue (we are LGBTQ so unable to try without intervention).  I am now 39 and it's my last real shot this year before everyone considers me too old, and I am terrified that my age is going to drastically lower my chances. 

They want to start with 3 rounds of natural IUI and decided not to use drugs because my reserves are lower.  Here in Sweden everything closes down in July, so when the clinic opens back up in Aug I am to call for a same day appointment when I get a positive ovulation test.

Husband has been a trooper this past week, but since I don’t know when I ovulate we’ve been doing the deed every other day, which is a lot since we barely do it once every week (because of me). 

He admitted today that while he knows getting pregnant again is everything to me/us, he gets nervous thinking about me going through a miscarriage again. He also said it’s been difficult for him to stay hard (he has been coming but I guess it took a lot of work for him mentally to get there) and now he’s afraid he might have ED (he’s only 27). He’s been looking into vitamins and all that, getting pretty nervous about himself too. I’m usually the one with anxiety so it’s scaring me a little to see my strong partner unsure of himself. 

We tried again tonight and I thought it was going well but he stopped and got soft inside me. He’s being as open as he can about it and is reassuring me it’s not because of me but I can’t help but feel like it could be me along with his stress.

I was incredibly lucky to have a team of senior specialists working towards identifying any and all underlying health issues that may have contributed to the loss of my son Arthur, as well as putting together a prenatal care plan for any future pregnancy. However, even with the wealth of knowledge I have come to realise that self advocacy is such a key part of receiving appropriate medical care.

I am a chronic researcher, I don't like the feeling of not understanding something that is being discussed with me. Because of this, I went to my follow up appointments armed with questions and basic knowledge that would help me understand the advice I was being given in relation to the results of my medical tests. Because of this I was able to identify two instructions that I received from one senior doctor that not only was incorrect, could have potentially been detrimental to my chances of a future successful pregnancy / birth (I made sure to receive second opinions from equally and/or more qualified physicians to confirm my suspicions).

Part of my results also showed that a medical condition that I had already known about, that I had brought up with many different doctors over the years and was repeatedly dismissed or put on medication that treated the symptoms but not the condition itself, may be the underlying thread to my history of pregnancy issues, infertility, and pre-term births. I had always thought it was an issue, but I didn't like pushing back on doctors because I didn't want to be a problem patient. But not anymore.

Be the problem patient. Seek second opinions. Demand more if you feel your concerns are being dismissed. Medical science is always advancing, standard advice is always changing.

If they can't take the time to explain the advice they are giving in a way you understand, and that you feel comfortable with, they either don't know it well enough, don't have the sufficient communication skills, or they don't care to. 

I know this is not always as easy if you are in a situation where you don't get a choice of doctor, but even there the patients that are more vocal get more attention.

I’ve read a ton about the first period after a loss and I know that it can take a few months for cycles to regulate normally but I haven’t been able to find out tons of details on people’s experiences with the second period etc. 

I used to have a very predictable period that was about 27 days and always 5 days long. My first period after the loss was actually really light which was nice as I had been warned it could be the worst period. It came earlier than I expected and I’m not sure if I ovulated as the hcg took weeks to leave my body. 

I just got my second period since the loss an entire week earlier than I thought (day 21!) and I’m now on day 7 of bleeding. I’ve never had cycles that short and now this long.

Ever since I’ve been very good about temping (Tempdrop, charting in Apple Health. Been doing it since December but I’m not very good about it). I had my first period post-salpingectomy on July 2, and have been taking OPKs every day since, as I know it can be a little off the first few cycles after a loss. 

I had a positive OPK on CD6 which i thought was weird and took another one later that day and it was super negative so I’m thinking it was a bad test. They’ve all been negative until dinner time last night so we BD last night and plan to for the next few days...

But my question is, what is up with my chart? There’s a sharp drop, then a slow rise to today’s temp...I’m just not sure what’s going on there. Can you ovulate CD6? If so, then was yesterday’s positive OPK a second OV? 

Here are my BBT chart and Flo for reference. Red are period days, blue dates are fertile window and blue circle is it’s new OV day estimate.
