I came home from the ER this morning (because when they know that your baby is dead they just let you sit there and wonder) and the neighbor had hung Halloween decorations in their yard. I thought to myself, ""Oh ghosts, just like my baby.""

I stopped getting morning sickness around 3 weeks ago and I was so happy to feel ""out of the woods."" I told my baby ""thank you for taking it so easy on me."" In some way, I celebrated its passing without knowing. I hate myself.

3,2048,confidence,<praw.reddit.Reddit object at 0x7f12a630cd90>,,ttcafterloss,"Has anyone had experience with this?

I gave birth to my sleeping baby 3 weeks ago today. My bleeding has been constant since. Not too bad after the 2nd day. I’ve had days so light I was brave enough to just wear a liner. This week my bleeding was worthy of a pad. Thursday was one of my heaviest days over the past weeks. 

One week after delivery (2 weeks ago) I went to the DR because bleeding was at the pad an hour and I was in a lot of pain. They thought I was getting an infection, now I’m wondering if it was because of placenta retention. 

Yesterday morning I partially woke up because I felt like I was gushing blood. It was maybe 4:30/5:00 (I didn’t look at the clock) and was not really awake. I rolled over and went back to sleep. At 5:27 I woke up for real this time. Same sensation. It was constant between wake ups. I realized I felt really sweaty but wasn’t hot. I felt my rear and realized I was saturated. I looked at my hand under light and realized it was blood. I totally freaked out, woke my husband to strip the bed, and went to the restroom. I’ve never experienced bleeding this severe in my life. I took a shower and gushing continued. Chunks about the size of a 0.5-1 inch cubes came out as well. Eventually, I was cleaned up and was laying down processing what just happened. It seemed to be over and I decided to call my doctor when they opened. 

When I stood up, I coughed and ran to the restroom. My hospital pad (I thought that might be necessary) was full and a clot/tissue the size of the palm of my hand landed on the bathroom tile. At this point I realize I should have gone to the ER not to work...  

I went to work but was in touch my my R.N. aunt, husband, and mom. I’m also a teacher and have a nurse with an ob background at my site. My doctor thought maybe it was placenta but could have been a last big gush (being 3 weeks out and having one bleeding issue already that was seeming to improve). They asked a million questions to assess my body’s response to losing so much blood. Our school nurse checked my blood pressure. They told me if I felt bad (showing a laundry list of symptoms) or had increased or bleeding on the heavier side to go to the ER. 

I did not have another event like the morning,  but I went through 2 additional hospital pads during the day and the blood was still bright (it has been this whole time). I went to the ER after work because everyone around me was worried and I was anxious about what was happening to my body. 

The ER determined I do have some retained placenta. My pregnancy test is still slightly positive as well. The OB on call did not want to do anything because my vitals were okay. I was instructed to call my doctor Monday. 

Has anyone experienced retained placenta 3 or more weeks after birth? Nothing in this pregnancy has been normal so this matches. I’m devastated that this experience is getting even more drawn out. I’m also concerned that it’s going to push back the time that I have to wait to TTC again. I’m so sad. 

TL;DR Retained placenta 3 weeks after vaginal delivery at 21 weeks. Has anyone experienced this? Was a D&C performed? Did you have to wait longer to TTC?

Update: I went to my doctor today. He reviewed everything form this weekend and shared that it’s not actually retained placenta. The issue is that my uterus is still measuring 14 weeks so it’s not clamping down. It’s filling will blood and I’m shedding lining. We talked about options wait and see or d&c. We decided to wait and see another week. He is going to do another ultrasound next week to find out if my uterus is shrinking. If it’s not we might go for a d&c because then more meds will be given to prompt my uterus to clamp down. 

I’m going to give red raspberry leaf tea a shot as I know it’s used to tone the uterus. 🤷‍♀️

Hiya 👋🏻 

I was active a while back now, from my sons stillbirth in 2015 through our two other MC and our ttc journey beyond that.

I’ve got something I wanna share with you guys because upon reflecting recently I’ve come to realise just how important this information can be to someone already dealing with bereavement and grief.

When James died it was, of course, world destroying. But my mental health spiralled in the months after his death in ways that I hadn’t experienced before and naturally I assumed it was normal grief and my doctors all thought the same.

It wasn’t until I began charting my moods with my menstrual cycle that I noticed that my worst days happened right before my period hit. This was no usual PMS that chocolates and a blanket would fix, I felt like my world was *ending*  every single month.

From ovulation to my period hitting my mood declined gradually, depression deepened, anxiety raised and in the 24-48 hours before my period hit, I’d become intensely suicidal and would have strong impulsive bursts of wanting to kill myself, I actually acted on this urge once, 4 months after James died, luckily I did no lasting damage. 

James would have been 3 this December and I just got a diagnosis of Premenstrual Dysphoric Disorder (PMDD). It’s basically an intolerance of the bodies natural hormones, progesterone is usually the one that people with PMDD are intolerant to. People with PMDD are likely to have severe mood reactions to contraception’s that contain synthetic progesterone like Depo Provera, Implanon etc. 

I joined a lot of support groups where I created a poll asking the ladies “did your PMDD get worse, stay the same or get better after having pregnancies?” 70 people responded, 69 said “worse” and 1 said “same”. There seems to be a huge correlation that this gets severe for women after having pregnancies regardless of that pregnancy ending in a live birth or a loss.

I now know that while I was experiencing normal grief after James died - there were still those couple of days per month that were just so unbearable because of PMDD and being bereaved made me *much* more vulnerable and at risk of acting on my suicidal impulses. I wanted to make people here aware of PMDD because this is something that can hit for the first time when a pregnancy ends, and it’s a crap show to go through this and loss at the same time so grab your charts and a specialist gynaecologist if you present with any symptoms of PMDD and do not let them fob you off with “its grief”. 

I can’t help but have it weigh on me the amount of ladies who actually end their lives in their PMDD episodes and it strikes me that the most vulnerable would be ladies experiencing pregnancy loss. 

This condition affects 1 in 20 women so there absolutely will be people affected in this community, perhaps without knowing it.

There is hope. There is treatment!

You can find more information on PMDD here. I’m not the most knowledgable on the condition yet but I’ll answer any questions where I can!

<p>I’ve got something I wanna share with you guys because upon reflecting recently I’ve come to realise just how important this information can be to someone already dealing with bereavement and grief.</p>

<p>When James died it was, of course, world destroying. But my mental health spiralled in the months after his death in ways that I hadn’t experienced before and naturally I assumed it was normal grief and my doctors all thought the same.</p>

<p>It wasn’t until I began charting my moods with my menstrual cycle that I noticed that my worst days happened right before my period hit. This was no usual PMS that chocolates and a blanket would fix, I felt like my world was <em>ending</em>  every single month.</p>

<p>From ovulation to my period hitting my mood declined gradually, depression deepened, anxiety raised and in the 24-48 hours before my period hit, I’d become intensely suicidal and would have strong impulsive bursts of wanting to kill myself, I actually acted on this urge once, 4 months after James died, luckily I did no lasting damage. </p>

<p>James would have been 3 this December and I just got a diagnosis of Premenstrual Dysphoric Disorder (PMDD). It’s basically an intolerance of the bodies natural hormones, progesterone is usually the one that people with PMDD are intolerant to. People with PMDD are likely to have severe mood reactions to contraception’s that contain synthetic progesterone like Depo Provera, Implanon etc. </p>

<p>I joined a lot of support groups where I created a poll asking the ladies “did your PMDD get worse, stay the same or get better after having pregnancies?” 70 people responded, 69 said “worse” and 1 said “same”. There seems to be a huge correlation that this gets severe for women after having pregnancies regardless of that pregnancy ending in a live birth or a loss.</p>

<p>I now know that while I was experiencing normal grief after James died - there were still those couple of days per month that were just so unbearable because of PMDD and being bereaved made me <em>much</em> more vulnerable and at risk of acting on my suicidal impulses. I wanted to make people here aware of PMDD because this is something that can hit for the first time when a pregnancy ends, and it’s a crap show to go through this and loss at the same time so grab your charts and a specialist gynaecologist if you present with any symptoms of PMDD and do not let them fob you off with “its grief”. </p>

<p>I can’t help but have it weigh on me the amount of ladies who actually end their lives in their PMDD episodes and it strikes me that the most vulnerable would be ladies experiencing pregnancy loss. </p>

<p>This condition affects 1 in 20 women so there absolutely will be people affected in this community, perhaps without knowing it.</p>

<p>There is hope. There is treatment!</p>

<p>You can find more information on PMDD here. I’m not the most knowledgable on the condition yet but I’ll answer any questions where I can!</p>

Lost baby A at 27 weeks and from then and one I was strong in front of people but soon as I was alone all I did was cry and want to be in the dark. I had my other baby at 32 weeks premature labor. I’m 100% sure my sadness is the reason I feel in a way she knew I was sad and cried for my other baby. After giving my birth i cried of happiness for my baby girl. She was rushed to the NICU. Soon as I gave birth to my baby boy him being out and not hearing a cry hurt. I knew it was gonna be hard but it was the most awful thing ever. They let me hold him as long as I wanted.

For a week straight after everyone left to work I would cry and not eat. Only thing that stopped me was hearing my babygirl. I once again felt I had to be strong. 

Now every time my babygirl reaches a new milestone or makes another month I can’t feel so much as happiness but guilt. I want to be happy but it’s hard because I should be celebrating it TWICE.  I cry when I think about him, see a baby boy, or hold my daughter. I had his ashes with me in my room. It gives me comfort being able to hold him and hug him. He’s in a teddy bears urn.

Have people gone on antidepressants after their losses? I don't know. I hate how the world isn't okay with people being sad about things that are sad.

So many pregnancies and new babies, and my daughter always wants to see all the babies when they come in. She&#39;s only 2 and a half but she was so stoked to be a big sister. </p>

<p>Have people gone on antidepressants after their losses? I don&#39;t know. I hate how the world isn&#39;t okay with people being sad about things that are sad. I talk really openly about my grief (anyone who followed me on instagram for pictures of my cats is not getting what they signed up for), so maybe people are just not used to seeing someone grieve so openly. It really makes people uncomfortable and they just want to fix it. It&#39;s really frustrating. </p>

24,2048,confidence,<praw.reddit.Reddit object at 0x7f12a630cd90>,,ttcafterloss,"Hi everyone. I wanted to join this community officially by venting through my experiences. I found this sub about a year ago when I had an early miscarriage around 8 weeks last October. My SO and I had decided to start trying the summer before and we were really excited to get pregnant so quickly. I wasn’t the most careful person throughout those two months (did a high impact workout and fell, in spraining my ankle) and I really blamed myself for the loss. It was a terrible feeling. On top of that, the OB office said some really hurtful things relating to how young I was (24) and the fact SO and I weren’t married. We decided to wait until I had a chance to get back into school and finish my last year so we would be more financially stable. 

I started tracking my cycle using apps and just avoiding my estimated fertile days, not using any actual birth control other than timing. It worked well for a while. SO and I took a trip to Italy in June, right in the middle, AF was supposed to arrive. I was stressing about that as I bleed really heavily for the first couple days. SO kept joking about ‘getting me pregnant before the trip so I wouldn’t have to worry about it at all’. Turns out, I ovulated later than usual and I discovered I was a couple weeks pregnant on the trip! We didn’t get a positive test until we got back to the states, a day after I had found out I was readmitted to school. We were so excited! But kept very quiet until we passed that 8 week mark. We told family and I told people at work, my boss had just had a baby so he was being incredibly supportive and just so fucking excited! 

We bought a stroller, moved into a two bedroom apartment, started looking into my maternity leave and insurance and daycare (~$2000/mo here) looking into me just working from home. So many plans! I was knitting a baby blanket. We were supposed to go to our anatomy scan last Friday. I was 19 weeks along this time. Throughout this pregnancy my uterus just felt really heavy, sitting down was pretty uncomfortable, but I thought it was all normal feelings. This was my fist time being so far along. I thought I just needed one of those belly bands and everything would feel a little better. I had a lot of lower back pain and talked about it with my OB, everything seemed normal! 

Tuesday night I started feeling contractions at regular intervals and was bleeding. I called the doctor-on-call number for my OB office and she told me not to worry. I trusted that advice and went to bed. I didn’t sleep very well and had to wake up really early the next day. I was still in pain, and started feeling the contractions again while at work. I called back, I was bleeding a lot more now. 3 hours later, after they finally called me back and I explained again my concerns, I was at a last minute booked appointment. 

They diagnosed me with an incompetent cervix, and said I was going to be transferred to the hospital and was going to have my baby that day. My cervix was open, and my waters were bulging. There was nothing they could do to stop the baby and it was too early to perform life saving measures. I saw the heartbeat for the last time when the doctor did an ultrasound. It was the fist time I had seen my baby move around inside me too. SO drove us to the hospital, and we had our daughter a couple hours later. Her name is Sophie. 

Last year I was so against trying again until I felt healed emotionally, now though, I was really, really looking forward to having that baby. Anxious, absolutely, but so excited for our lives to change forever and have our little baby in our lives. I want to try again ASAP. Even though she was a surprise, we were so ready for her. 

I feel so cheated by my own body, but also by my OBs office. I can’t stop thinking what would have happened if I had just stuck to my guns and told the doctor on call, ‘no, this isn’t normal at 19 weeks, I’ll see you at the ER in 20.’ I will forever regret just falling asleep that night, and haven’t slept very well since then. Both experiences make me not trust any doctors office for my physical or emotional support. But with my recent diagnosis of IC, it’s not like I can’t forgo treatment from them. 

I’m also starting to find myself slipping into that old resentment mindset towards so many people who didn’t want kids and don’t take care of themselves yet still have healthy babies somehow.

**[TW: LC, rainbow]**

As my post history suggests, I lost my son almost a year and a half ago on April 29, 2017 at 18 weeks. Today (roughly) should have been his first birthday. I have a almost 4-year old LC, and a 5 month old rainbow, who was born 50 weeks after my son's death and birth. 

I think a lot of us hope that a rainbow will fix everything. I certainly considered my rainbow to be a ""replacement"" for my son during the early stages of my grief. She is not a replacement. I still miss my son. The grief is still there. Some days, I look at her and can barely function, knowing the only reason she's here is because he is gone. Other days, most days, I try to simply be thankful that I have her. I don't think you're ever ""cured"" of grief; I had many family members and friends, after our loss, say they had a miscarriage and still get misty-eyed, 30 years later. I think sometimes, it's still just as fresh. But the pain comes less frequently. Sometimes, you can even talk about them feeling only grateful that you had any time with your lost child(ren) at all.

I found that loss made me an extremely paitent parent. I have many less f@#$s to give unless it's putting someone in irreparable danger. My rainbow had a rough time for the first couple of months, but it was fine; I was just grateful to have the opportunity to be with her. But it made me extremely stubborn regarding spending time with her. Part of me feels that, in order to ""make up"" for my ""failure"" to keep my son alive that I must sacrifice everything to give my rainbow the best of everything, much to the detriment of myself and the rest of my family. I'm getting better with letting go, but I still struggle.

We all talk about how much we hate getting the bills, sometimes months, after a loss. But no one ever mentions the catalogues and coupons for first birthday parties and toddler formula. I was baffled to get a first birthday party ad when my rainbow was 4 months old. And then it hit me like a truck: it was for Aspen's birthday. A birthday he'll never have. You'll run into people with kids if the same name, or the age they should be, and it still hurts. I have a hard time imagining Aspen as a toddler; I think he'll always be a baby, in my eyes, so maybe this will get better over time.

We talk about how much her brother loves her and how much I love him, though they may never meet. I plan to have my girls know what happened to us as they grow up, so that should this ever happen to them, they know they're not alone.

Today, I sucked it up and took care of my girls. For dinner, my husband and I are going out for fried chicken sandwiches: the only thing I could eat without throwing up during my pregnancy. Then we're going to drink (I have a babysitter for the night). And we're going to cry. We'll light his candle and hug his lovie. Then we'll go to bed, and I'll spend my usual hour thinking about and talking to my son. 

It gets better. But you'll never be the same, and that's ok.

From the beginning I suppose will help. 
At 19 weeks anatomy scan showed 2 “cysts” in the back of the brain, small and OB wasn’t concerned but referred me to MFM.  At 23 weeks MFM did an US and said it looked like a tumor, more solid than liquid so off to fetal MRI ASAP for further looks.  2 weeks later the MRI was done.  We had gone from a cyst to a small tumor to a large dural sinus malformation with a blood clot.  It was huge, he essentially has an  aneurysm that’s taking up close to 1/3 of the cranial cavity.  Every look since then it has grown in size. The effect this has on other structures is devastating.   They’ve said from less severe to most,hydrocephalus, blindness, CP muscle like issues, seizures to the inability to control body temp, Blood pressure, breathing, heart rate, and finally would probably not be conscious.  There’s only 14 case studies on the malformation and no one knows how or why it occurs. No one has a solution other than prepare for him to pass. So, I’m to continue the pregnancy because of how far along I am knowing he can be stillborn or he won’t live past delivery and if he does not for very long after that. I feel numb.  I never ever thought I’d be on this side of things, I work in nicu and see so much and now it’s my turn to be under the microscope.  Our case is being passed around, I’ve been scheduled to see all the docs in the MFM practice and I feel like it because it’s so they can all see the rare deformity.  
How do I do this knowing he won’t make it. I feel like my emotional response is all wrong, I’m not crying or an external mess when I have to tell people about this, I think they feel I’m cold. I keep being told I’m so strong and mature and they just don’t know how I can keep it all together.....

TL;DR at the end.

Hello everyone. I really tried to make it shorter but it’s still long. 

I’s been over two weeks since my TFMR and think I’m ready to introduce myself. I think it will be somehow therapeutic for me. I feel really lonely and I don’t have anyone to talk to. I also hope it will help someone in the future. When I faced the condition of my baby for the first time I couldn’t really find much about it on reddit, so maybe my story can help someone in the future.

We were very happy to find out I was pregnant in June and decided not to tell anybody until 12 weeks, se we wouldn’t jinx it. When bleeding started I was prescribed progesterone and booked an early ultrasound. We told our parents as we knew we might need their support. At 6 weeks appointment our baby was measuring just fine and there was a heartbeat. The one odd detail was that there was no yolk sac (still not sure if that is relevant, the doctor couldn’t decide). They told us that it was fine but we needed to come back for the follow up in 2 weeks. And so we did. During the 8 weeks appointment everything looked good. Stronger heartbeat, yolk sac where it should be, proper measurement. We finally agreed to my mother’s intense nagging that we should let her spread the news. And everything was marvelous until we went for our 13 weeks NT scan which showed that our baby had a giant omphalocele which contained whole liver, intestines, and stomach. I was crushed, but my husband stayed optimistic (perhaps only for my sake), telling me that it will fix itself (there was a tiny little chance for that to happen during the next two weeks). But it didn’t. The 15 weeks follow up showed that during the period of 14 days our baby has only grown 8. The omphalocele was bigger than before. We were told that there might also be problems with baby’s spine and legs, so we had to go to a public hospital the following week for CVS. 

I need to mention that where I live, public hospitals are AWFUL. So we came at dawn and waited in this insane line for 6 hours. Then they called me banning my husband from joining me. The staff were talking only to each other saying how small (the gap between the estimated days and actual days expanded) and thin the baby was, making a really inappropriate, hurtful comments. I don’t know how to translate it so let’s say they were calling my baby ‘this bizarre midget who probably has a triploidy’. Then they told me to sign papers that I consent to the procedure, but wouldn’t let me mark the type of the procedure. Then the doctor decided to go with the amniocentesis (since one of the nurses came to learn that, not CVS) – still not talking to me at all. I was lying there with my eyes on the ceiling trying to be somewhere else when suddenly I felt the needle in my uterus and started to cry, really hard. I won’t lie – it hurt. I cried mostly because I felt mistreated in this really hard moment of my life. I felt like I was there so the nurse could learn. And she wasn’t good. She didn’t know how to do it. She was poking for far too long in my body, trying to change the position of the needle, not knowing what to do. Finally, after what seemed like forever, she managed. So they wrapped the sample up and started to fill in some forms. In the end, the doctor looked at me irritated (I was still crying) and told me something like ‘There is no need to cry, I didn’t say that your baby is going to die FOR SURE’. I left as fast as I could telling my husband that I will never ever come back to this place. 

Since my NT scan I have read a lot about omphalocele, including stories on facebook group. We knew we need to discuss our options. No, not with the doctors. Just with each other. Where I live termination is barely legal and they wouldn’t consent to it unless there were chromosomal abnormalities or I would be dying. We got the QF-PCR results quite quickly – no abnormalities. And it was a girl. It was so much harder to make the decision knowing that it was our daughter, a real person with a name at this point. But we knew she wouldn’t survive. They would make her suffer from indescribable pain and fear just to see how much further can medicine go. And she wouldn’t make it. Not with the omphalocele, not with no abdominal cavity to put the organs back, not with her heart being at that point so completely out of place, ready to be pulled to omphalocele sac. So we decided we have to let her go.

We knew we couldn’t do it where we live, so we had to plan this whole trip to a different country. And there we finally had been taken care of. The medical staff was AMAZING. They cared for us and supported us. They offered us additional ultrasound and consultation. They did everything they could to make us feel safe. I delivered my daughter at 18 weeks, but she was measuring 1,5 weeks less. We were able to see her and say goodbye. I think I was in shock at that time so I didn’t ask to hold her and that I will regret forever. She was precious. Leaving her was really difficult for me, but knowing that her ashes will be spread with the ashes of other children in a beautiful place helped. She won’t be alone. We named her Felicia in hope that she will have better luck wherever she went from here.

And now I am home, with a broken heart, missing her so so SO much. And I can’t really talk to anyone. As I said – termination here is a very controversial subject. And right know we don’t feel the strength to defend ourselves from pro-life people who would call us murderers. They wouldn’t understand that we chose to suffer, so our baby girl wouldn’t have to. The only people who know about our TFMR are my parents, my husband’s mother and her mother (despite our request not to tell ANYONE, my MIL told her mother, but that’s a rant for different occasion). Everyone else, including my siblings, had been told that I miscarried. So it feels really lonely, not being able to talk about what I have been through and how I feel.

I know it was longer that it should have been. But it really helps me to write. If there is anybody looking for information about omphalocele or seeking support, don’t hesitate to send me a message. Thank you very much for reading  🌻

<p>Hello everyone. I really tried to make it shorter but it’s still long. </p>

<p>I’s been over two weeks since my TFMR and think I’m ready to introduce myself. I think it will be somehow therapeutic for me. I feel really lonely and I don’t have anyone to talk to. I also hope it will help someone in the future. When I faced the condition of my baby for the first time I couldn’t really find much about it on reddit, so maybe my story can help someone in the future.</p>

<p>We were very happy to find out I was pregnant in June and decided not to tell anybody until 12 weeks, se we wouldn’t jinx it. When bleeding started I was prescribed progesterone and booked an early ultrasound. We told our parents as we knew we might need their support. At 6 weeks appointment our baby was measuring just fine and there was a heartbeat. The one odd detail was that there was no yolk sac (still not sure if that is relevant, the doctor couldn’t decide). They told us that it was fine but we needed to come back for the follow up in 2 weeks. And so we did. During the 8 weeks appointment everything looked good. Stronger heartbeat, yolk sac where it should be, proper measurement. We finally agreed to my mother’s intense nagging that we should let her spread the news. And everything was marvelous until we went for our 13 weeks NT scan which showed that our baby had a giant omphalocele which contained whole liver, intestines, and stomach. I was crushed, but my husband stayed optimistic (perhaps only for my sake), telling me that it will fix itself (there was a tiny little chance for that to happen during the next two weeks). But it didn’t. The 15 weeks follow up showed that during the period of 14 days our baby has only grown 8. The omphalocele was bigger than before. We were told that there might also be problems with baby’s spine and legs, so we had to go to a public hospital the following week for CVS. </p>

<p>I need to mention that where I live, public hospitals are AWFUL. So we came at dawn and waited in this insane line for 6 hours. Then they called me banning my husband from joining me. The staff were talking only to each other saying how small (the gap between the estimated days and actual days expanded) and thin the baby was, making a really inappropriate, hurtful comments. I don’t know how to translate it so let’s say they were calling my baby ‘this bizarre midget who probably has a triploidy’. Then they told me to sign papers that I consent to the procedure, but wouldn’t let me mark the type of the procedure. Then the doctor decided to go with the amniocentesis (since one of the nurses came to learn that, not CVS) – still not talking to me at all. I was lying there with my eyes on the ceiling trying to be somewhere else when suddenly I felt the needle in my uterus and started to cry, really hard. I won’t lie – it hurt. I cried mostly because I felt mistreated in this really hard moment of my life. I felt like I was there so the nurse could learn. And she wasn’t good. She didn’t know how to do it. She was poking for far too long in my body, trying to change the position of the needle, not knowing what to do. Finally, after what seemed like forever, she managed. So they wrapped the sample up and started to fill in some forms. In the end, the doctor looked at me irritated (I was still crying) and told me something like ‘There is no need to cry, I didn’t say that your baby is going to die FOR SURE’. I left as fast as I could telling my husband that I will never ever come back to this place. </p>

I've been reading all your stories and comments for the last 2 months and thought it was time to share my story and get some insight. 

I had my first ultrasound at 11 weeks on August 2nd. There was no heartbeat and baby was only measuring 8 weeks. This baby was very wanted and my husband and I were devasted. I took misprostol that evening and after a hard night of labour at home, passed what I thought was everything.

For the next 3 weeks, I went for weekly HCG blood draws and my hormones were dropping very slowly. I had some bright red bleeding again after 2 weeks and so my midwife sent me for another ultrasound. This ultrasound showed that I had a thick uterine lining of retained tissue. I was so dissapointed. I thought I was gearing up for a period but instead was sent for a D&C. (this is now 4 weeks post MC) 

I've been having a really hard time. I can't stop counting weeks. I should be 19 weeks but instead today marks 2 months post MC and 1 month post D&C and I still haven't gotten a period. I know I'm still within the realms of ""normal"" but I naively thought I would be pregnant again already. 

My best friend and I were 6 days apart. I cry every time after I see her. Some days my thoughts are darker than I ever thought possible and some days are better. 

I'm wondering if you can shed some light on if I count my MC from Misprostol as day 1 or from my D & C as day 1 (in terms of when I should expect a period)

My NIPT came back negative and my doctor said my daughter looked great at her 20 week anatomy scan, except her couldn't get a good view of her heart because she was in the wrong position. He told me to come back at 24 weeks.

That appointment got cancelled by the doctor so I had to reschedule at 25 weeks. I went in and he looked at her heart and told me it was fine. Then he went back over her face and told me he couldn't find a nasal bone and that I should go to maternal fetal medicine in the next few weeks. My heart sank and I insisted I be seen immediately.

An hour later I was at MFM getting another sonogram. I couldn't stop crying and I had to stop looking. The doctor came in with a laundry list of anomalies. Not only did she not have a nasal bone, she did not have a nose. She also had a cleft in the front of her skull, her eyes were set far apart, a large cyst in the back of her brain, and the vessels around her heart were narrowed and misaligned. I was in shock, I don't know how my doctor missed all of it.

My husband and I were told that she had some sort of genetic disorder and I had an amnio done. It came back normal. We decided we could not risk her suffering and it would not be fair to our 2 living children. We decided to terminate the pregnancy. It was the most heartbreaking decision I ever had to make.

We had the procedure done about 2 weeks later. We received and injection to stop her heart and I was induced. I told her I loved her the entire time. At first I was afraid to look at her because I knew she had facial deformities but then I thought about how she is my daughter and I had to be brave and give her the respect she deserved.

It was shocking. Her face had never fused. There were no open clefts but her nose had never formed and her nostrils were set far apart. I feel so bad for being shocked at her appearance, my own child. She was a baby at that point, not a fetus. She had reached viability even though it would have been tough. But I know she would have have had a hard short life.

I became obsessed with finding out what did this to her. Eventually I found a disorder called acromelic frontonasal dysostosis and everything fit. The pictures looked just like her. It is extremely rare with an occurrence of less than one in a million. There are about 20 documented cases of it in scientific literature. It causes severe intellectual and physical disabilities. We are still waiting on the genetic testing to confirm.

I am completely lost. I can't stop crying and thinking of her. I am so mad my doctor didn't notice it until it was so late and that he missed so much. Her medical records show that he had checked off nasal bone and face seen at 20 weeks which is a lie. There are no pictures in her file from the 20 weeks scan. I am going to therapy and it helps but I don't know how I will ever get past the loss of my very wanted daughter. Her name is Vanessa.

Found out a femoral hernia had recurred 2 days after BFP. When the loss happened, it was assumed a surgery and a year of WTT would commence. A CT scan and multiple surgical consults later...they clear me to TTC again. They tell me to just keep a close eye on the hernia and know that emergency could be a potential (but they won't fix it now if I'm planning to be pregnant anytime in next 2 years).

So...in the week between the loss and the final surgical consult, my fiancee + parents booked us a trip to Punta Cana early November (active zika area). As a surprise. Without telling me.

On the other hand.... we have no known medical reason to rush, and 4 months of travel (I'd have like 4 upcoming trips vs cancelling them all bc pregnant with hernia = no flying), loosing more weight, sushi and medical marijuana indulgence sounds okay.

Part of me is glad she’s offering to do something, but the other part of me feels like this might not be my issue— I was so symptomatic up until my d&c: sore huge boobs, nauseous and exhausted, etc. If my levels had been low (which I don’t believe they tested for) then would I have felt that pregnant?

Also she seemed surprised to hear me say that I was still getting positive pregnancy tests at 2.5 weeks out from my d&c and ordered bloodwork to see if I had “remnants” of the pregnancy, despite my cervix being closed.

<p>I thought I was spotting earlier because I got just a little red mixed with brown when I wiped. I was feeling a little crampy but not much, and now it seems to have ramped up a bit.

I've been trying to conceive since 2015. We tried naturally with no success for most of 2015. In 2016 I went to the OB, and since my periods are very infrequent they put me on Clomid with no monitoring, which resulted in me getting pregnant but losing the baby at 7 weeks. I had to take a few months off from trying after that and I tried again in 2017 for a few months using clomid. I got pregnant for a second time, but lost the baby again around 7 weeks. They did chromosomal testing and it came back negative, so they classified me as unexplained infertility. The OB told me I could keep trying because sometimes it takes 4-5 miscarriages until you get success, so 2 is ""no big deal"". I got rid of him and went to a new OB group.

I wanted to share with you our kickstarter page for our live action short film ""Held for a Moment"" which follows the journey of a young woman after the loss of her stillborn child.

My grand mother and my best friend had a stillbirth and I felt absolutely helpless, as a result I have written a short film to raise awareness about stillbirth and the impact it has on families.

Supporting this films means encouraging powerful female based narratives in film and supporting all those women and families who have lost their new borns.

We have reached more than 64% of our goal but we have 10 days left to reach our full goal or all the money will be returned to each individual backer.

My husband had just started trying after our honeymoon and it was a really weird time because this insane diagnosis had just come out of absolutely nowhere and then we were supposed to be excited for this pregnancy. I decided to tell my dad about the pregnancy because I thought maybe the prospect of having his first grandchild would give him added strength to fight through his cancer. He was excited as he could be given how weak he was and I just had a bad feeling. Sure enough the spotting started, back pain, and just plain ol’ womanly intuition told me this wasn’t going to happen. Found out on my 29th birthday I would be miscarrying based on my HGC levels of 48, I was 5 weeks pregnant at this point and this number was way too low to be that far along. A couple days later the miscarriage happened. One month to the day after that my dad died. That summer almost destroyed me. I lost half of who I was and who I was going to be all in the matter of a month.  I really took the time to do the whole self care thing. Cried until I physically couldn’t, laid in bed, went for acupuncture for both grief and fertility purposes and with the support of my husband some how started feeling normal again. 8 months later after a fun vacation with my husband and best friend I got pregnant again. Not going to lie, I was NOT excited... it took me 3 days to even tell my husband I was pregnant again because all of the fear and anxiety came flooding back the second I peed on that stick. The entire pregnancy was miserable. Didn’t help my appendix ruptured when I was 14 weeks, just worked up the courage to share the news with our family and friends and I had to have emergency surgery. Thankfully this time everything worked out and I gave birth to a gorgeous, healthy (big ass) baby boy! Right now, he is 10 months old and my period, which I’ve had since 7 weeks PP (like really? So unfair) was late last week. Took a test on the second day of missed P and tested negative but I wasn’t convinced. I went back the next day and pulled it out of the trash and sure enough faintest line ever. Waited a couple more days and bought 3 more and definitely obvious line. Went in for a blood test on what would be 5 weeks 2 days and got the bad news that my HGC levels were once again super low and out of range for what I should be. Clocking in at 166 when the test chart shows I should be over 1000 at this point and was close to 3000 at the same point in my successful pregnancy. Having been through this before I know what comes next and have just been waiting and waiting. Because my doctor went away for the weekend I was unable to get another requisition for a blood test so I can monitor the HGC levels, and my requisition for an early ultrasound is also useless at this point because they won’t be able to see anything anyways and just tell me to come back. So I’ve been having wicked back cramps all weekend and just waiting for the worst. So far no spotting or bleeding, hoping it’s not a missed miscarriage and I’ll have to take the drugs to force It, I just want it to happen naturally and get it over with already. Sorry for the long post but I’m afraid pregnancy is forever ruined for me. How can I ever try for more kids and mentally withstand another pregnancy? Every twinge, every test, every part of it stresses me out. Not knowing what is going on in my own body right now is probably the worst feeling ever. I don’t know if I can ever do this again. I wanted 3 or 4 kids so badly but now I don’t know. I thought having a successful pregnancy after my first MC would give me the confidence I needed to keep going and growing my family but now this shit again?

I took misoprostol on 9/13 at about 8.5 weeks after confirming that I'd had an MMC. My hCG on that day was a little over 110,000. I went back into the office on 9/17 and my hCG had dropped to 6,343. By 9/19 (so 6 days) it was down to 2,900. They want to follow up again next week to make sure it's dropping appropriately but other than telling me that 6,343 was high, they haven't told me anything regarding the numbers. 

Does anyone have any idea how quickly the numbers should be going down? How long did it take your hCG to get back to near zero? I'm really anxious for it to go down so we can start trying again.

Just in case anyone is reading this in the future, a week after my hcg was at 2,900 it was at 878. Not as low as I was hoping but my doctor told me it is going down fine and we will follow up again next week.

He was healthy and I had the best pregnancy imaginable with him: no stress, lots of fun (travel, time with family) I had absolutely no complaints during or regrets about his pregnancy, I was 100% prepared to be a mommy (I still am a mommy but I don’t get to take care of my baby) 
I have always wanted to be a mom, I love kids, had always worked with kids, spent lots of time with my niece and nephew which was my favorite thing to do.
Now I don’t have my baby. I was going to be a stay at home mom so I don’t have a job right now either and am wondering who would hire someone like me (can’t work with kids right now, it’s just too painful)
I used to think of myself as a very happy person who truly appreciated everything she had. I often thought “I’m really lucky”. 
Now I am the complete opposite. I cry all the time and I thought it may very slowly get easier but so far it has not gotten any easier, I really don’t have ANY thoughts that are not about my baby. The fact that his death was due to misdiagnosis makes it that much harder because it should have been prevented.
Now I am really concerned how things will be in a future pregnancy. (Which isn’t happening anytime soon but I know even after a while I won’t ever be the carefree happy person I was) I am worried that the stress will negatively impact a future pregnancy. I always thought my baby was going to be a very happy baby because of how happy I was. 
I am worried about a miscarriage.
I was sure I was going to be a laid back mom and now I can’t see myself not stressing over sids or something happening to them. 
I am going to go to therapy but I obviously will never be the person I used to be and I know I’ll probably still cry about my son every day for years to come.
How can I help a future baby during a future pregnancy not get all the stress hormones/ sadness that I feel. How can I make sure I don’t become a crazy overprotective helicopter mom? 
How does sadness impact a baby during pregnancy? (I read some articles about depression during pregnancy but it’s mostly about general depression, not depression due to a traumatic event)

It took 40 days to ovulate, and I actually feel fortunate that it even happened at all. I'm now waiting for my first actual post-m/c period, and then the doctor said we can try again next cycle. 

During the m/c ultrasound the doctor diagnosed me with enlarged ovaries and multiple cysts (PCOS). That was a big surprise for us as I have regular 32day cycles, no male pattern hair or balding, glucose tests always came back perfectly normal, etc. However, now thinking about it, I did have a hard tine adjusting after quitting BC in 2012. I got terrible acne for the first time in my life (gone now due to miraculous accutane) and it took like 3 years for cycles to regulate. So I'm assuming I've had PCOS all this time. Part of me hates myself for not finding this out before we started trying, if the loss was avoidable, if my body matured a bag egg because of the cysts or insulin resistance. 

So.. I did lots of research (PTL for pubmed), and re-read certain sections of It Starts With The Egg and Impatient Woman's Guide to Getting Pregnant. I had dumbly skipped the chapters on PCOS and m/c... ignorance is bliss. :(

Here's my current regimen:

Inositol 

Xue Fu Zhu Tang

250mg Magnesium

CoQ10

Fish Oil

Prenatal Gummies

Iron

Zinc

&#x200B;

Also, I was drinking green tea every morning and this time around I plan to quit all caffeine until the second trimester at least. Even tho the docs all say it's okay to have a cup of tea, or even coffee, I subsequently read studies that said green tea impairs the uptake of folic acid. I used to drink coffee (sadly gave it up about a year ago), and my friend introduced me to something called Teechino - basically herbs and nuts, roasted, that legit smells and tastes like coffee! But no caffeine, no acid, high potassium, soluble fiber, etc. I'm curious if anyone else has tried it? I can't believe they don't tell more coffee-drinking women about this as an option!

We lost our first pregnancy at 5 weeks. We were devastated but our doctor told us that it's very common and to just keep trying. We got pregnant again a year and a half later. Unfortunately we found out during an 8 week ultrasound that there was no heartbeat. The next day we met with our doctor who scheduled me for a D&C for the following week. Then, I had to travel for my sister's wedding where I was the maid of honour. I smiled for pictures, drank champagne and gave toasts while inside my heart was broken. It was really important to me that my sister get her day. That Sunday, my husband had to fly back to work. We couldn't afford for him to stay home because he just finished a two week vacation. He couldn't be with me for my D&C, my sister came to stay with me. He's gone for a month and I think that is what is making this so much harder. I want him home so badly.
