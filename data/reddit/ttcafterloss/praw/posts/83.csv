We had a missed miscarriage and had a D/C on 9/04.  However, I did not have any complications from the surgery.

My husband and I found out we were pregnant in May, lost the baby about 2 months later just a few days shy of the ""12 week you're good"" period. It broke me, I think part of me will always be broken, but I'm in a much better place now. 

&#x200B;

Fast forward to this morning. Backstory- I'm in the military and every six months we have weigh-in's. If you've miscarried prior to 20 weeks you have a 6-month waiver for weighing in, over 20 weeks you have a year. Now I am within my weight requirements right now, I got the waiver because my last weigh in (in May) I had just found out I was pregnant and I didn't want this one to mess with me mentally as a reminder of all that's happened. 

So today I go to the office to give them my paperwork, I had to hand over this single piece of paper with ""miscarriage"" smack dab in the middle explaining why I wouldn't be stepping on a scale this morning. The guy I give it to, looks it over, and just says he needs to ask his supervisor how to handle this and if there's anything extra I need to do, no big deal... Then I have to look over my beneficiary paperwork and make sure it's up to date, and sign at the bottom (as you do during every weigh in). My benefits had not changed (only my husband), so as I'm signing, the guy goes ""hopefully this time next year we'll be changing your dependency status to add more!"", and my heart sank. I just nodded and said yep, because part of me didn't even think I had heard correctly. I left the office thinking *maybe he thought I was pregnant* because I don't know what else would have made him say that. My husband have been TTC ever since getting the green light from the doctors with no luck, but that was like a punch in the gut.

So I started writing a list and I posted it on social media of the things I never knew before my loss.

No one tells you there exists a world full of the darkest pain imaginable.

No one tells you that there is a world where you leave the hospital with a death certificate and not a birth certificate.

No one tells you that there is place that makes the tiniest urns and that instead of buying diapers you get to go there. 

No one tells you that the pain of child birth is nothing compared to holding your baby for the last time, ever.

No one tells you that you can scream “don’t make me do this” for hours on end, but it won’t change anything.

I decided to let the MC run its course on its own, and 10 days later, I MC'd, but then with the bleeding and pain, I went to the ER.

There, after a \*very long\* transvaginal ultrasound, they told me that everything had passed and gave me meds for the pain.  But then they also told me I had a heart-shaped bicornuate or septate uterus (I'm one of the lucky 3% of women!).

Tomorrow, I get a hysteoscopy to get a better idea of my ""setup"", and if there's nothing that can be done, I keep TTC with up to a 40% chance of recurrent MCs & 60% chance of a full-term healthy pregnancy, but if they're able to reduce/remove the septum through surgery, I have to wait 3 months but have an 80% chance of success.

Right before Christmas last year I had an abort!on at 17 weeks of pregnancy because we found out the baby had a terminal condition. (For those folks who don’t understand how I could have an abort!on, since I’ve talked to quite a few pro-lifers and even been called “disgusting” for having an abort!on— it was better than waiting around to give birth to a stillborn baby.)
.

After the procedure I developed an unexpected complication and hemorrhaged just over 3 pints in a matter of minutes. Which is the story of how I got my very first blood transfusion. So I can cross that off my bucket list.
.

After the blood loss, I had to wait a few months to recover before it would be safe to try for another baby. Finally (after a small eternity) got the green light and started trying again....
.

Except I haven’t gotten pregnant. Never had that problem before, but now it’s been months and months and I’m still having my regularly scheduled periods as normal.
.

As I’m sure many of you know, from the outside that sounds like an uninhibited sexual paradise, free from the hassle of contraceptives. From the inside, it’s sex on a schedule whether you feel like it or not. Whether you’re tired or not. Forget romance. There is no romance anymore. By this point my husband and I both look at the calendar and just groan. Like, “Do we have to?”  “Can’t you get pregnant by sitting on the couch and watching tv???” If only Netflix and chill literally meant finding a show on Netflix and relaxing for a change.
.

So we’ve been slowly cutting back on the sex. At first it was every 2-3 days during the fertile window. Now it’s once a week. I talked to my husband this morning about taking next month off.
.

I ask myself questions like, “Do I really want a baby that bad?” I’m not even disappointed when my period starts anymore. I would actually be shocked if I got pregnant at this point. It just isn’t happening.
.

I don’t know why. Never been a problem before. Maybe I’m just too stressed out about it? I’m stressed out over unrelated life stuff but there’s not a hell of a lot I can do about that. Life is just stressful right now. I pretty regularly feel like I’m losing my sanity.
.

I think my husband and I are learning to hate sex, and I keep asking myself “what’s the point? You’re not going to get pregnant anyway?”
.

So that’s pretty much where I am in this journey. Baby or no baby, I’ll be really happy when it’s over.

<p>Right before Christmas last year I had an abort!on at 17 weeks of pregnancy because we found out the baby had a terminal condition. (For those folks who don’t understand how I could have an abort!on, since I’ve talked to quite a few pro-lifers and even been called “disgusting” for having an abort!on— it was better than waiting around to give birth to a stillborn baby.)
.</p>

<p>After the procedure I developed an unexpected complication and hemorrhaged just over 3 pints in a matter of minutes. Which is the story of how I got my very first blood transfusion. So I can cross that off my bucket list.
.</p>

<p>After the blood loss, I had to wait a few months to recover before it would be safe to try for another baby. Finally (after a small eternity) got the green light and started trying again....
.</p>

<p>Except I haven’t gotten pregnant. Never had that problem before, but now it’s been months and months and I’m still having my regularly scheduled periods as normal.

Trigger warning: Mentions of female bodily fluids, mildly gorish reference to periods, natural miscarriage.

Right now I'm going through a miscarriage it started 9/30 and I figured it was a normal period. It got real this past Tuesday (10/8) bleeding was bad, worse than when I had my second (first live birth ended in life support decisions for brain death) based on things I saw (passed tissue / fetus) and was told at the ER I was about 6-8 weeks along. I figured at most maybe 3 or 4. My pregnancies are not necessarily difficult but prone to not textbook symptoms. 

I have been oscillating between hormonally sad and just how do I cope what do I say to people, stoic because I want and need to support my husband and angry that everyone is handling this with kid gloves or acting like I must be okay or throwing sympathy with a dash of pity, because I'm still trying to keep on keeping on; honestly I'm stubborn as heck. I don't know how upset I'm allowed to be because so many folks rely on me keeping the house and family together it's a whole post on it's own. My husband has been super supportive and I'm trying to reciprocate and feel like I'm failing.

The weeks prior to this I had a massively stubborn headcold where getting out of bed wasn't happening (clue one that I'm probably pregnant) with daily rolling nausea (clue two). The normal OTC tests don't register positives with me for whatever reason, blood work at the ER did confirm that it was positive.

My in-laws while being supportive and picking up my slack around the house have also felt the need to inform people for me about it as they were in the room against my want; we asked they wait in the waiting room they insisted for support purposes. All I wanted was me, my husband and a change of pants. It was not a fun experience and I felt like it was more spectator sport than me getting the care I needed. Can't change the past but I now know for sure what I should do if there's a next time (I hope like hell there's not) to anyone going through this right now you have my deepest sympathies.

My hormones are doing their thing so if I'm not crying, I'm feeling intensely frisky, which after reading on miscarriage is a thing. I don't even know if I'm grieving the way I need to because I am all over the damn road. Yes I'm sad, but also need to be close to my husband it's confusing but I'm working on it.

Am I allowed to cry, because we were trying for this, am I allowed to be angry that people know on someone else's terms because support? I don't want pity, I want to be able to talk about it. If I get pregnant again there will be at least an 7 / 8 year gap between my first and second child. We've been trying for a while. I'm afraid they won't be close. Should I just stop at one? There's fertility issues at play, and a csection.

I'm on bed rest for at least a week. I've got my child by myself right now because the inlaws decided to go out I must be doing okay right? Hubby is at work it's unavoidable he just doesn't have the time and I wouldn't ask because his parents are here or well they are usually.

I let my doctor know we haven’t been successful since our MMC in May and that my mental health was taking a toll each month. She said she’d follow my lead on beginning next steps in infertility testing. 

So...what should a girl do / ask? As always, thank you for making this shitty situation less shitty.

52,2048,confidence,<praw.reddit.Reddit object at 0x7f12a630cd90>,,ttcafterloss,"Had my D&E yesterday at what was (?) or would have been (?) 15+6. This is my 4th loss: 12 week MMC (D&C), 8 week MMC (naturally passed), 4 week CP, and now 15 week MMC. I did have 1 LC between loss #2 and #3. 

This pregnancy had appeared to be progressing completely normally. We had a good 12 week NT scan and clear NIPT results. At my 13 weeks checkup we got a little peek of her sucking her thumb on the bedside ultrasound. If you saw my post a few days ago, you might remember that I only went in because I hadn’t been able to find her heartbeat on my home Doppler for a few days and wanted a peace of mind scan due to my history. That was when we discovered her heart had stopped beating when I stopped being able to hear her. 

From what my doc saw at the surgery, there were no obvious physical abnormalities that were missed on our scans that would have explained this. Both my OB and MFM still seem to think the answer is mostly likely genetic—either that myself or my husband have a balanced translocation that’s passing on as unbalanced or that there is some other genetic issue that is not tested for in the NIPT. 

So we are sending tissue from the D&E for a microarray. If you have any experience with the test, how long did it take to get your results? And what has been your experience?

And FWIW, I personally lean toward a thrombophilia. I have a family history of clotting disorders, and of my 5 pregnancies the only one I did anything different was with my son. I had taken progesterone supps until 16 weeks and baby aspirin until about 26 weeks as a “can’t hurt might help”. My progesterone was tested in this pregnancy and was totally fine (and I made it far enough for the placenta to take over just fine). But the baby aspirin sticks o to me as the one big variable.

<p>This pregnancy had appeared to be progressing completely normally. We had a good 12 week NT scan and clear NIPT results. At my 13 weeks checkup we got a little peek of her sucking her thumb on the bedside ultrasound. If you saw my post a few days ago, you might remember that I only went in because I hadn’t been able to find her heartbeat on my home Doppler for a few days and wanted a peace of mind scan due to my history. That was when we discovered her heart had stopped beating when I stopped being able to hear her. </p>

<p>From what my doc saw at the surgery, there were no obvious physical abnormalities that were missed on our scans that would have explained this. Both my OB and MFM still seem to think the answer is mostly likely genetic—either that myself or my husband have a balanced translocation that’s passing on as unbalanced or that there is some other genetic issue that is not tested for in the NIPT. </p>

<p>So we are sending tissue from the D&amp;E for a microarray. If you have any experience with the test, how long did it take to get your results? And what has been your experience?

Hi everybody, I had a missed miscarriage at 7 weeks with a failed misoprostol dose on the 8th ish and a d&c on aug 12. My HCG level right before the miscarriage was somewhere around 42000. I had a shorter than average period starting sep 13th, maybe 4 days but with one day of heavy bleeding, ewcm on the 26ish, and now my period is due any day now but I don’t feel anything except mildly nauseous which is normal for me at my period.

Nothing compared to what some of you ladies have been though. Everyone’s stories are so heartbreaking. I’m so sorry everyone’s loss.

Background: I stopped HBC July 16th after being on it for 13 years. My Mom is a nurse and told me that my doctor would say to wait 3 months before trying. Well apparently that is not the case anymore because my doctor said just go for it right away, so that’s what we did. I got pregnant my second cycle off HBC. After I told my Mom about the miscarriage she made a few comments about my body not being ready (not what I needed to hear). Now I can’t get it out of my head that that’s why this happened-thanks Mom. 

It’s been a week now since I passed everything (doctor confirmed). Today was the day we were supposed to have our first ultrasound to hear the heartbeat, so definitely a little emotional today. Our doctor said that we should wait till I have 1 more normal period before trying again. This is mainly for dating purposes but she also said “so my uterus can recover”. What has everyone else’s doctors said about this waiting to TTC again? 

I’m also going down the rabbit hole of “how can I make sure this doesn’t happen again?” I’ve thought about changing my diet (whole 30 or paleo), no drinking and/or waiting 2 or 3 months to TTC. We don’t have an unhealthy diet now, but I could cut out all sugar and processed stuff. What’s the right thing to do? I want to be able to say: I did everything I possibly could to make this work. 

I have a strong A type personality so this whole process is very frustrating to me. I know I can’t control what my body does and it’s driving me nuts. I just feel the need to do something to have a better outcome next time! Anyone had success with a diet change? Should we give my body a few extra months to recover from the HBC and miscarriage?

I'm 38 days post-MMC. Of course, those first few days were waves of shock and grief, and over the following few weeks I felt more hopeful, despite still experiencing moments of extreme sadness. I'm thankful that my husband and I have been able to lean on each other so much through all of this and that I have my mom to talk to (who has also experienced a MC).

Out of nowhere just now, I started bawling... Grief is such a messy thing that doesn't have a rhyme or reason. Sometimes it just hits me like a ton of bricks. Overall, I'm feeling pretty hopeful to try again (or at least that's what I'm aiming to focus on), but then some days/moments I'm extremely sad and angry. Like right now. Trying to just take those emotions as they come and not stuff them down (although sometimes I want to). It's hard to even explain how I'm doing when people ask, because I honestly think that I/we are doing quite well all things considered, but at the same time I'm not really okay. Lol. Does that make sense? I feel like it doesn't unless you've gone through this.

I think some of it also stems from people just not being sensitive at all to my loss. I think sometimes I get angry that my pregnancy/baby vanished to some of my friends/family the moment they found out we miscarried. It's like it never happened... and I'm a little hurt by that. People talking about their pregnancies and TTC around me without a thought to the fact that I just freaking lost my baby a few weeks ago.

Anyway, I'm so just EXTREMELY emotional the last few days and I'm 100% sure it's hormone related... but in what way? I don't know and it's driving me a little nuts.

Maybe I'm just saying that so that I don't get my hopes up at all. I'm also bracing myself for a potentially really bad period. I've had of/off cramps, on/off sore boobs, and just generally 'weird' sensations down there. I love that early pregnancy and PMS symptoms are practically the same thing. Again, I feel like I'm not.

My husband and I conceived a few months after we got married last year. Both of us want kids more than anything, so obviously we were very excited.  Early on the pregnancy was right on track, but at the anatomy screen we were referred to a MFM.  They saw some abnormalities (NT, enlarged kidney, clenched hands) so we did an amnio.  Everything came back normal so we went back to the Regular OB at 22 weeks who told us everything looks fine, weird things happen.  Then slowly his femur started measuring small, then off the charts small.  At 31 weeks we did an MRI and were basically told the abnormalities, especially brain development, signaled a fatal form of spinal dysphasia.  

I was induced at 35 weeks, and our son passed during labor.  This was certainly the hardest thing we’ve ether gone through, and my husbands been through a lot in life.  
My husband and I were told at the time the odds of reoccurrence were probably astronomical, but we should have genetic screening to be sure.  

The baby’s cord blood was analyzed and he had two bad copies of a recessive gene.  The disorder this causes has 7 documented cases previously in the world, as far as my googling could tell.  Again we were told the odds of reoccurrence would likely be very small.  My husband and I could have each passed on one bad copy, but it was much more likely at least one of the bad genes was a de novo mutation independent to our son. 

And then three days ago we got our blood tests back.  We’ve both carriers of a gene so rare the odds of passing on the trait (in the general population) is way less than 1 in a million, but if we have any other children, the chances it’s passed on is 1/4. During the pregnancy, in retrospect at least, I could feel something was off... but I didn’t expect this outcome at all.  Im floored by this news and I’m having a pretty difficult time knowing how to deal with it. 

The obvious choice here seems to be IVF.  We’ve had a couple meetings with a doctor and there is a specialty lab that has been sent our bloodwork to try and make a custom probe to screen our embryos for these genes.  The doctor was careful to say there’s no guarantees that a probe can be made since this is new territory, but it’s fairly likely one can be developed. As soon as the probe is made we can schedule an egg retrieval date.  

Sorry this is super long, I’m not even sure where on reddit this post is most appropriate, but has anyone gone through a similar experience? IVF seems like a pretty tough process and I didn’t expect to have to go through it.  

From what I understand if I did get pregnant naturally the earliest screening would be cvs at 11 weeks.  This would carry a risk of miscarriage if it’s a 3/4 fetus that didn’t get both recessive genes, but we’d have to do it.  And if the baby was a carrier (of both recessive genes) I’d have to find a way to terminate the pregnancy (in Texas by the way).   

Any advice on how to navigate this going forward? I feel lost in all of this at this point.  I feel mad and sad we’re forced into IVF... but maybe it’s good we can screen for everything now after all we’ve been through?  We have the resources to do IVF and as I said, we both really want kids.

I’m doing okay but I’m 9 million % sure I have lingering PTSD from the whole situation. I have people to talk to but I need help with trips and tricks to dealing with triggers specifically. I also hold a lot of resentment overall because I feel like I didn’t have enough time to grieve my loss- it was always “go go go, work work work” and I feel like my baby deserved better than that.

What exactly do you talk about? 

Do they make you give a quick run down about what happened? 

Are my details of my story going to be too much for the therapist to handle? 
I don’t want to make anyone uncomfortable- certainly not a childbearing aged woman who could have problems of her own going on. I’m not against men but I feel like I’d do better with a woman.

Last month we found out we were pregnant after TTC for 2 years. I went in for my first official ultrasound at 8 weeks (did one prior but they couldn't really see anything bc they said it was too early).  They found that it was a molar pregnancy, got a D&C the following day. The doctors told me that after the surgery, I would have to come in weekly to check if my hCG levels were going down. And that we couldn't actively TTC and to use some sort of birth control. I didn't follow this advice. (I am judging myself) So weekly I went in, and my levels were steadily decreasing. 

Two weeks ago, I got to down to 3, and then a week later I get a call from my doctor saying that my levels increased back to 555. My first thought was a possible regrowth and/or cancer. My doctor voiced her opinion saying that she also thinks it's a regrowth and to make an appointment with a gyno-oncologist which I did. But knowing that I had unprotected sex and we weren't careful a few times, I told her that so she told me to come in to check my levels again.  I went in for two more blood tests, Friday 9/27 they were at 1933, and then the following Monday 9/30 it was 5414. 

I had my appointment yesterday, and at first the oncologist took a look at my history, information, and levels and agreed with my OB and said it could be a possible re-growth. I told him that we did have unprotected sex, which I got a scolding for. He said he would set up an ultrasound to rule out the possibility of a new pregnancy. I went into the ultrasound thinking they would find a regrowth but the technician said she didn't see any signs of regrowth and she found a gestational sac. 

Here is where I need your opinion/advice: What does this all mean? I remember when I went in for that early ultrasound with my first pregnancy, they did see something but they couldn't make out what it was. Just because a gestational sac is there doesn't mean that a molar pregnancy can't come back right? The doctor hasn't called me back yet, and I'm so confused.

A few days after I conceived, I ran my hands through my hair and had _handfuls_ of hair fall out. Since then it's still been falling out consistently, even now almost three weeks after my MC. 

I've mentioned it several times to the gp and they put it down to hormones. I'm concerned about an underlying thyroid issue and am fighting a battle with my private insurance to get some further tests. 

If it is 'just' normal pregnancy hormones, what I'm worried about is that it will eventually stop, but when I (hopefully) conceive again, it will kick off another round of shedding.

<p>Yesterday we learned that one of us is a carrier of T13, much to the surprise to our genetic’s counsellor. We will be going forward with blood tests to find out which of us is the carrier. If it’s him, likely to reoccur 1%. If it’s me, 14-20% chance of it reoccurring.</p>

<p>Have any of you TFMR due to T13, only to go on and have a healthy baby post-tx? How did you get past the fear? I’m not looking to try tomorrow. Probably not in the next months but I guess I’m looking for some hope in a really dark time right now.</p>

I was on progesterone injections with my oldest until 24 weeks and progesterone suppository with my youngest until 10ish weeks when I just had a feeling everything was fine. I was on progesterone for my last two miscarriages and baby aspirin with the last. 

With my last two pregnancies ending in miscarriage I have seen three different doctors, including an R.E. (which was awful) but finally I pushed my current OB to do more testing and I came up heterozygous for Factor V Leiden. I also am heterozygous for MTHFR a1298c, which I know is common. My plasminogen was also low. 

My frustration is that I can’t find information saying that these conditions really and truly cause clotting or miscarriages. I am just looking for SOMETHING. Some clue to try something else to give me some hope. 

I’m 28, I get pregnant quickly, all my other extensive labs were normal. My children were born on the small side but nothing indicative of intrauterine growth restriction that I know of. 38.4weeks and 6lbs 12oz and 37.6 and 5lbs 13oz. The only thing that happened with both pregnancies was that my uterus measured weeks behind at the end of both and I had to have an extra ultrasound to check fluid levels. Could that be a sign of IGR?

I wasn’t surprised about the FVL because my period comes out in small clots with no flow... but it’s hard to tell what’s normal or not. If I have a clotting disorder that’s not THAT big of a deal as far as the research shows, then why am I seeing these clots in my period? Why am I having these miscarriages?

189,2048,confidence,<praw.reddit.Reddit object at 0x7f12a630cd90>,,ttcafterloss,"This happened about a month and a half to two months ago and we are still dealing with it. At the time, my wife (I'll call her H) and I had been trying to concieve for 7 or 8 months before we finally got a positive pregnancy test. H took multiple over a span of two weeks with them all saying positive. We were waiting to go to the doctor because her grandmother was in town visiting and we wanted to suprise the whole family together and didn't want grandma to know yet. On Wednesday morning my wife woke up with heavy bleeding and we started to get panicked and we rushed to the on base hospital. (I'm in the Air Force) We went to the emergency room and told them that H was about 6 weeks along and that we hadn't come in to confirm the pregnancy yet and she was having heavy bleeding. They took us back into the room to be checked out. H brought the pregnancy tests with her which, keep in mind, were taken over a span of 2 weks and were 3 different brands. The airmen who were tending to her (the highest one was a SrA and there was even a freaking tech schooler in there) were telling each other jokes the entire time we were in there completely regardless to the fact we were in the process of losing our child. Part of me thinks that it was because my wife and I are both young so the people probably thought we were relieved to be losing the kid since so many people like to wait until their late 20s or early 30s. When they finaly took my wife back to go recieve an ultrasound, they made her use the bathroom first and she passed the fetus in there. She saw the embryonic sack, but when she moved to get a better look the automatic toilet flushed. They then did the ultrasound and said that there wasn't anything in there. Despite the fact we had 5 pregnancy tests saying she was pregnant, and the fact that there was HCG in the blood report, they decided that she had never actually been pregnant. They said and I quote, ""The HCG levels were low, so you aren't pregnant."" It was to my understanding that if you had any HCG that meant you were, but okay. My wife is now terrified of trying to get pregnant again because she is so scared of them not taking it serious or believing that she is actually pregnant. She's also scared that we're likely to lose more babies because since they said she was never pregnant to begin with, they won't give her the rogam shot to make sure that her body doesn't attack that baby. (We're both Rh- but my mom was positive and we don't know her biological dad's) She just told me yesterday that she still can't sleep (we're on opposite schedules so I haven't been aware of this) 2 months later and that she can't stop zoning out thinking about it. I thought I was handling it well until 2 weeks ago when she started talking to me about it more, because I didn't know that she had passed it before getting the ultrasound, and I broke down into hysterics. All I could think about was that he was supposed to be my baby and be a person, not get flushed down a toilet and eaten by some freaking fish. I've taken to carrying a onsie that I had bought before it happened in my cargo pocket so that I can still feel close to him. I tend not to think about it but I know deep down I'm just trying to ignore the pain and anger. Anger at myself and anger at those airmen who were telling jokes while my baby was dying adn anger that they just dismissed us as not having ever been pregnant. I don't know how to help myself or my wife. It's more important for me to help her because I can block out the pain most of the time, but she can't stop thinking about it. What is something that would help? I've thought about maybe therapy, but what is something I can do for my wife?

At the time, my wife (I&#39;ll call her H) and I had been trying to concieve for 7 or 8 months before we finally got a positive pregnancy test. H took multiple over a span of two weeks with them all saying positive. We were waiting to go to the doctor because her grandmother was in town visiting and we wanted to suprise the whole family together and didn&#39;t want grandma to know yet. On Wednesday morning my wife woke up with heavy bleeding and we started to get panicked and we rushed to the on base hospital. (I&#39;m in the Air Force) We went to the emergency room and told them that H was about 6 weeks along and that we hadn&#39;t come in to confirm the pregnancy yet and she was having heavy bleeding. They took us back into the room to be checked out. H brought the pregnancy tests with her which, keep in mind, were taken over a span of 2 weks and were 3 different brands. The airmen who were tending to her (the highest one was a SrA and there was even a freaking tech schooler in there) were telling each other jokes the entire time we were in there completely regardless to the fact we were in the process of losing our child. Part of me thinks that it was because my wife and I are both young so the people probably thought we were relieved to be losing the kid since so many people like to wait until their late 20s or early 30s. When they finaly took my wife back to go recieve an ultrasound, they made her use the bathroom first and she passed the fetus in there. She saw the embryonic sack, but when she moved to get a better look the automatic toilet flushed. They then did the ultrasound and said that there wasn&#39;t anything in there. Despite the fact we had 5 pregnancy tests saying she was pregnant, and the fact that there was HCG in the blood report, they decided that she had never actually been pregnant. They said and I quote, &quot;The HCG levels were low, so you aren&#39;t pregnant.&quot; It was to my understanding that if you had any HCG that meant you were, but okay. My wife is now terrified of trying to get pregnant again because she is so scared of them not taking it serious or believing that she is actually pregnant. She&#39;s also scared that we&#39;re likely to lose more babies because since they said she was never pregnant to begin with, they won&#39;t give her the rogam shot to make sure that her body doesn&#39;t attack that baby. (We&#39;re both Rh- but my mom was positive and we don&#39;t know her biological dad&#39;s) She just told me yesterday that she still can&#39;t sleep (we&#39;re on opposite schedules so I haven&#39;t been aware of this) 2 months later and that she can&#39;t stop zoning out thinking about it. I thought I was handling it well until 2 weeks ago when she started talking to me about it more, because I didn&#39;t know that she had passed it before getting the ultrasound, and I broke down into hysterics. All I could think about was that he was supposed to be my baby and be a person, not get flushed down a toilet and eaten by some freaking fish. I&#39;ve taken to carrying a onsie that I had bought before it happened in my cargo pocket so that I can still feel close to him. I tend not to think about it but I know deep down I&#39;m just trying to ignore the pain and anger. Anger at myself and anger at those airmen who were telling jokes while my baby was dying adn anger that they just dismissed us as not having ever been pregnant. I don&#39;t know how to help myself or my wife. It&#39;s more important for me to help her because I can block out the pain most of the time, but she can&#39;t stop thinking about it. What is something that would help? I&#39;ve thought about maybe therapy, but what is something I can do for my wife?</p>

August- was using cheap ovulation test and it did not detect a surge
September- decided to splurge since I didn’t get a surge last month and bought clear blue digital advanced ovulation tests. I am on day 7 of high fertility.

I am getting my progesterone tested 10/3 by obgyn. I keep saying I am going to go back to my fertility doctor end of year but every failed cycle that timeline moves up.

I just don’t think I can handle ovulation issues on top of my many other fertility issues.

<p>I&#39;m currently 10 days post-miscarriage. I got my BFP and a week later to the date I miscarried. I was 14 DPO when I found out so I was really early. I think I had a Chemical Pregnancy because of how early it was and my pregnancy symptoms only lasted a week. I had a natural miscarriage and passed everything on my own. My doctor wants me to wait 3 months for my body to heal and to I guess mentally heal since I do have OCD, anxiety and depression. I feel like I&#39;m ready to start sooner than 3 months and will really start TTC after my first AF.</p>

We are still working through our grief after having several second trimester losses, last one being twins. My SO’s family have always been distant when times have gotten tough for us, so our losses are somewhat of a taboo topic around them. We don’t discuss.

Lately, his sister and mother will not stop talking about how much the new baby looks like my husband. To the point that my MIL is approaching my SO at work among his colleagues (family business) and showing him newborn pictures. He tries to deflect and say he thinks the baby looks more like his sister, but his mom is just not having it. She is adamant he looks like my partner. My husband is never one to cause a fuss but he did tell me privately it makes him feel awkward and sad.

I’m trying to convince myself to not let it sting as much as it does. We plan on finally starting to try again in the next month or two (waiting for a dye test), so I think this all feels really fresh. My fear/anxiety are at an all time high. I have accepted that the fear will linger and I just need to recognize it for what it is - that it’s totally normal.

A little background on me, I had 3 miscarriages all at 6 weeks. 2 were missed miscarriages and we found out at 10 weeks and 12 weeks. First miscarriage was a chromosome abnormality, second was inconclusive, and we didn’t test the third because in the moment I was so distraught and didn’t want to know. 

After the second miscarriage we did all the semi normal tests, diabetes, thyroid, Blood clotting, etc. all came back normal. 

Then after our third we were sent to an RE and she found that me TSH levels were undetected, and I had positive TgAB. So I was referred to an endocrinologist and they tested for TSI and it came back positive, that’s when I got my diagnosis for Graves. I’ve been taking PTU for about a week. 

All of that to say although we’re not positive they caused my miscarriages it feels good to have an answer and be treating something that could have an effect on pregnancy. I’m crossing my fingers my levels become normal soon so we can start trying to conceive again.
