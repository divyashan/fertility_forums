I experienced a 20w loss a few months ago and while going through it I met a girl who experienced the same thing a couple months before me.
Since then she's had 2 more first tri miscarriages and she's feeling sooo discouraged (obviously). 

She lost the first baby due to a blood clot so she did the whole genetic testing and everything came back completely normal. Next two pregnancies she took baby aspirin and still lost them, so now she's headed to the high risk doctor. 

I'm just wondering if there is anything you guys can think of that she should bring up to the doctor about testing? Like progesterone levels? I actually don't even really know what I'm even looking for. I just want to help her any way that I can :(

I had an ultrasound this week at 7 weeks 2 days which showed no heartbeat. My OB wasn’t available so I talked to one of the OB nurses in the clinic about my options (D&C vs misoprostol vs passing naturally). She changed my first OB prenatal visit which was supposed to be two weeks from now to a follow up visit instead and said I could discuss any further questions at that time. It’s not that anything is urgent, but it would have been nice to at least discuss my situation/options with her personally or been offered an earlier appointment.  Anyway, I don’t know if it’s rash but I decided to transfer care to a midwife instead. I feel like what I need from my OB I’m just not getting.  I want my provider to be proactive and not minimize my losses although I’m sure my previous CP 2 months ago won’t count and they’ll say it’s normal to have one loss.

I had an ultrasound this week at 7 weeks 2 days which showed no heartbeat. My OB wasn’t available so I talked to one of the OB nurses in the clinic about my options (D&amp;C vs misoprostol vs passing naturally). She changed my first OB prenatal visit which was supposed to be two weeks from now to a follow up visit instead and said I could discuss any further questions at that time. It’s not that anything is urgent, but it would have been nice to at least discuss my situation/options with her personally or been offered an earlier appointment.  Anyway, I don’t know if it’s rash but I decided to transfer care to a midwife instead. I feel like what I need from my OB I’m just not getting.  I want my provider to be proactive and not minimize my losses although I’m sure my previous CP 2 months ago won’t count and they’ll say it’s normal to have one loss.

27,2048,confidence,<praw.reddit.Reddit object at 0x7f12a630cd90>,,ttcafterloss,"Hi friends,

I'm 35, married, trying for a baby for over a year. Discovered somewhat diminished ovarian reserve a year ago while getting tests done for embryo banking (only made 2, no PGS). Got a little more serious in December and visited an RE. First medicated cycle was Clomid/TI, second was Letrozole/Ovidrel/IUI.

The IUI resulted in a pregnancy with an October EDD. This was a bit unexpected, since I had never gotten a positive and thought it would take much longer. I had just quit a terrible job and was looking forward to some time off, and started to panic a bit about looking for my next job so I could get maternity benefits.

The pregnancy itself looked promising for a few weeks, albeit with some lower than average betas and minor spotting. And then suddenly, I had some heavy spotting and my betas took a nosedive during week 6-7, a few days before my scheduled ultrasound.

I am unusually pragmatic (to the point where some may consider me cold), so I wasn't terribly upset over the news of the miscarriage (nothing I could have done, etc, etc). Yes, I was sad that it didn't work out, but I am incredibly hopeful for future attempts. I was more frustrated that I'd spent so much time obsessing over mc statistics during the last few weeks (which, in retrospect, had no impact on the outcome), and now I have to spend more time waiting until my body is ready to try again (at 35, I don't feel like I have all the time in the world). On a less serious note, there was also a family wedding/trip in August that I was hoping to avoid attending with my pregnancy as an excuse.

I love that there is such a supportive community on Reddit. I've read posts by women (and men) who are going through fertility journeys that are much more difficult (and longer) than mine, and these stories are not only inspirational, they help me maintain perspective. My heart goes out to everyone on this sub; it's a shitty situation, and I wish everyone the best of luck.

In 2013, before we we're married, we had a surprise pregnancy that resulted in an early (8 week) miscarriage. It was very traumatic and I suffered from depression for years as a result. We started trying to conceive again about six months later. But haven't been able to get pregnant since. 

We were in denial for sure for a while. But when I turned 30 we decided we couldn't be in denial anymore. So we saw a specialist, ran a bunch of tests. Found out we have issues on both sides. More on mine than his though. We decided to do Ivf. We had a good retrieval and after wards I got surgery for endometriosis. 

We finally did an embryo transfer last month. And I started getting positives! And they would get darker and darker. We got a positive beta on Valentine's day. The baby would've been due five days from our wedding anniversary. It was a boy. We affectionately called him Elmer, so he would stick. It felt meant to be. But our joy was short lived. The betas wouldn't double. Then they slowed down a lot. And last week I found out I was gonna miscarry. Stopped my meds and two days ago I miscarried the sac. It was extremely traumatic for me...I didn't expect to see it as I hadn't last time. And now I am just...in hell. I feel so worthless. And so empty.

In 2013, before we we&#39;re married, we had a surprise pregnancy that resulted in an early (8 week) miscarriage. It was very traumatic and I suffered from depression for years as a result. We started trying to conceive again about six months later. But haven&#39;t been able to get pregnant since. </p>

<p>We were in denial for sure for a while. But when I turned 30 we decided we couldn&#39;t be in denial anymore. So we saw a specialist, ran a bunch of tests. Found out we have issues on both sides. More on mine than his though. We decided to do Ivf. We had a good retrieval and after wards I got surgery for endometriosis. </p>

<p>We finally did an embryo transfer last month. And I started getting positives! And they would get darker and darker. We got a positive beta on Valentine&#39;s day. The baby would&#39;ve been due five days from our wedding anniversary. It was a boy. We affectionately called him Elmer, so he would stick. It felt meant to be. But our joy was short lived. The betas wouldn&#39;t double. Then they slowed down a lot. And last week I found out I was gonna miscarry. Stopped my meds and two days ago I miscarried the sac. It was extremely traumatic for me...I didn&#39;t expect to see it as I hadn&#39;t last time. And now I am just...in hell. I feel so worthless. And so empty. And I&#39;m so sad that I have to suffer through another empty mother&#39;s day. I also have to wait to try again till summer as I&#39;ll need another surgery which just makes it all worse...</p>

<p>Anyway I&#39;m sorry for the wall of text and thank you for reading.</p>

Yesterday more bleeding and passed clots and a piece of tissue. No cramps or pain. Wasn't completely soaking pads but there was quite a bit of blood going into the toilet. I was pretty worried and scheduled another ultrasound for this morning, fearing no heartbeat or an open cervix and that I would need misoprostol or a d&c. 

This morning they tell me I had a miscarriage and it was all gone. I must have flushed it yesterday. I was so shocked. My past losses there was so much blood and pain, and I had almost zero cramps this time. I am partially relieved I don't have to go through the physical pain this time. I feel so guilty I flushed it.

My February baby. My April baby. My July baby. And now my October baby. 4 times in 9 months. What the fuck.

Just before Thanksgiving, my husband and I lost our son just shy of 23 weeks.  

This was my first pregnancy.   I know quite a few people who've had trouble getting pregnant.  And I qualify as AMA--with all the associated risks.   When my husband and I started TTC, we took everything month by month, and took nothing for granted. 

Shortly after I learned I was pregnant, my sister announced that she was pregnant with her second.   She was about 7 weeks along, I was 6.  And her news made me feel worried--it was so early, and our EDDs were so close, that if anything were to happen to either of us, it would just be really hard….  I didn't want to share our news at that point.

We had the first ultrasound to confirm the pregnancy/heartbeat, the NIPT, the NT scan, the quad screen.   All OK.  Still, I wanted to wait to share our news.  At the anatomical US at 19 weeks, everything looked healthy. I knew there were still milestones to get through, but I felt hopeful for the first time, like I could start enjoying my pregnancy a little.  We started sharing the news that we were expecting.

The next week, we learned that the baby had one, possibly two congenital heart defects (CHDs).  This was completely unexpected.  Still, we were comforted by the fact that the issues were common, and treatment was straightforward, with no lasting harm to the baby.  

From there on out, worse news rolled in every few days.   The baby didn't have other symptoms, but the cardiologist wanted to rule out a specific microdeletion syndrome as the cause of the CHDs, so we went for an amnio.  In the meantime, a third CHD was discovered.  The baby would need a more serious and very rare type of operation, right at birth--one that not all infants survive, and which sometimes results in some neurological damage/developmental delays.  Obviously, this wasn't the situation we wanted for our baby, but it still seemed to us like chances for a good outcome/good quality of life were too good to not give the baby its chance.  

Then we got the amnio results.  The suspected microdeletion syndrome was ruled out.  Instead, the baby had a different, much rarer microdeletion syndrome.  It affects roughly 1 in a million to 1 in 3 million births.  The syndrome generally can't be identified in an ultrasound---essentially, everything looks okay on the US, but many things aren't functioning properly.  It was a completely unexpected, blind-siding diagnosis.  [And I'm sorry if that's hard to hear about for those of you who might already be anxious about the future.]

Our baby turned out to have a particularly severe form of this microdeletion. It's extremely rare, and babies often do not survive the first 9 months.  There were at least 5 or 6 foreseeable ways the baby could die before or after birth.   Whichever way things developed, the baby would have to undergo multiple surgeries if it was born alive….  If the baby survived those, no one could say what quality of life our child would have.    Future surgeries were definite.  Blindness, deafness, never learning to speak, walk, or control their bladder/bowel movements, predisposition to two types of cancer in childhood and beyond….all of these things were possibilities.    And that was without considering complications from the heart surgery/other things that could go wrong.      

We felt like we couldn't risk putting the baby through so much potential suffering with such poor a prognosis for quality of life.  Faced with so many different, and painful ways the baby could die, we felt like the best thing we could do was protect our baby from that suffering.  We decided to have an induction.  We had 36 hrs to make arrangements and spend some last time with the baby, and then we had to go to L&D.  Our baby passed away in peace, warm and safe in mama's belly, surrounded by the sounds of mama's heartbeat, and maybe mom and dad's voices.  I delivered him the next day.  

I had wanted the sex of the baby to be a surprise, so we only learned when the baby was born that it was a little boy.  He was amazing.  So tiny and perfect, you wouldn't know to look at him that he was so sick.  

Our family is sad for us...no one's second guessed our decision.   They have good intentions, but have kind of botched attempts to be supportive.  Our visit home for Christmas was particularly bad, and since then, I've mostly stopped talking to them about how I'm doing.  Friends have been a little better.  

Initially after the loss, I oscillated between wanting to be pregnant again as soon as possible, and being afraid of future pregnancies.  Testing indicates that we are probably not carriers for this microdeletion.  My OB said we could start TTC in the new year.  

So we started in January.   In one way, it was a relief.  Being of AMA, I didn't want to wait too long.  But on the other hand, I still have all the risks of (now even older) AMA, along with some not easy decisions about other tests/scans, related to our son's diagnosis, if/when it gets to that point.   Not to mention all the other diagnoses one learns about when seeking support from others who've experienced TMFR/perinatal loss.  This is going to be a long road.  

I decided to join this sub, because this past month, I feel like I've kind of plateaued in feeling better.  Or even been back-sliding.  Getting my period the first cycle we TCC was sad.   On balance, the thought of being able to TTC again helped keep me going in those first couple months, and now that wind has kind of been taken out of the sails.  Plus, my sister's daughter is going to be born in two weeks….and the week after, our son...will not.   Even though I've been to a bereavement counselor a few times, and my husband and I have connected with a parent support group for perinatal loss, one of the most helpful things for me has been reading threads of people who've gone through this.

But on the other hand, I still have all the risks of (now even older) AMA, along with some not easy decisions about other tests/scans, related to our son&#39;s diagnosis, if/when it gets to that point.   Not to mention all the other diagnoses one learns about when seeking support from others who&#39;ve experienced TMFR/perinatal loss.  This is going to be a long road.  </p>

<p>I decided to join this sub, because this past month, I feel like I&#39;ve kind of plateaued in feeling better.  Or even been back-sliding.  Getting my period the first cycle we TCC was sad.   On balance, the thought of being able to TTC again helped keep me going in those first couple months, and now that wind has kind of been taken out of the sails.  Plus, my sister&#39;s daughter is going to be born in two weeks….and the week after, our son...will not.   Even though I&#39;ve been to a bereavement counselor a few times, and my husband and I have connected with a parent support group for perinatal loss, one of the most helpful things for me has been reading threads of people who&#39;ve gone through this.</p>

<p>So here I am.  Sorry we&#39;re all in this boat.</p>

81,2048,confidence,<praw.reddit.Reddit object at 0x7f12a630cd90>,,ttcafterloss,"Background: I’m currently 31 and my husband is almost 33. We’ve been married for 10 years and have a 2.5 year old daughter. It took about 4 years of TTC to have her (though we admittedly weren’t in a big hurry most of that time and were mostly NTNP). 

This time around we lazily tried again for around a year, then got pregnant the first cycle we were really intentional about it. 

Everything seemed to be going well. Ultrasounds at 9, 11 and 13 weeks all looked good and the baby had measured normally each time. My second trimester screening tests all came back normal. Baby had a strong heartbeat at my 16 week appointment. 

My husband’s brother and his wife (who we are very close to) also happen to be expecting and her due date is a month behind what mine would’ve been. We scheduled back to back appointments with them at a local ultrasound studio to find out the sex of our babies at the same time. 

This appointment was where we learned that out baby was not moving and had no heartbeat at 19 weeks. This was a total shock because I had had no symptoms indicating that anything was wrong. My husband, daughter, mother, sister, brother and sister-in-law and two nieces (3.5 and 5) were all there with us. Part of me hated that our families found out like that but I was also relieved that we didn’t have to call them out of the blue to deliver the bad news. 

After getting to the hospital and getting checked in to a room on the labor and delivery floor, the doctor did an ultrasound to confirm and noted that he saw some swelling around the baby’s head. He then told us I would be induced with Cytotec (misoprostol), given vaginally every 6 hours. They said I would probably be there for a day or two. After just two doses, our baby was born at 6:15am on February 4, 2018, less than 9 hours after the process was started. It was then that we learned that we had a son. The OB noticed that the umbilical cord was a bit thinner than normal where it connected to the baby. Thankfully, I didn’t have to push at all because the thought of doing so was quite scary to me for some reason, especially since I’d had a c-section with my daughter and had no idea what to expect. I don’t remember much else that happened during the delivery or for several hours afterwards since I was still groggy from Ambien (sleeping medicine) and Stadol (pain medicine). I was given both of these medications when I’m sure everyone thought the delivery was a long way off still. Part of me regrets that I don’t remember more since that was the only memories I’ll ever have with my son but part of me thinks perhaps it was a blessing as it was by far the most difficult experience I’ve ever had. 

We didn’t get any answers as to what exactly happened. We weren’t offered to have testing done in the hospital and by the time we realized it, it was too late. My doctor proactively ordered lab work to test me for clotting disorders. The results should be in next week. 

Tomorrow will be three weeks and I feel like I’ve been on a rollercoaster emotionally. The next several months will be hard with my due date approaching and the addition of a new niece to our family who will always be the same age that my son should be.

",t2_156q44,False,,0,False,MMC at 19 Weeks,[],r/ttcafterloss,False,0,intro,0,,,False,t3_801qyw,False,dark,0.96,,public,24,0,{},,8b677c92-711f-11e4-b63c-12313b0b807d,False,[],,False,False,,{},Intro,False,24,,False,self,1519668598.0,,[],{},,True,,1519556475.0,text,0,,,text,self.ttcafterloss,True,"<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=""md""><p>Background: I’m currently 31 and my husband is almost 33. We’ve been married for 10 years and have a 2.5 year old daughter. It took about 4 years of TTC to have her (though we admittedly weren’t in a big hurry most of that time and were mostly NTNP). </p>

<p>This time around we lazily tried again for around a year, then got pregnant the first cycle we were really intentional about it. </p>

<p>Everything seemed to be going well. Ultrasounds at 9, 11 and 13 weeks all looked good and the baby had measured normally each time. My second trimester screening tests all came back normal. Baby had a strong heartbeat at my 16 week appointment. </p>

<p>My husband’s brother and his wife (who we are very close to) also happen to be expecting and her due date is a month behind what mine would’ve been. We scheduled back to back appointments with them at a local ultrasound studio to find out the sex of our babies at the same time. </p>

<p>This appointment was where we learned that out baby was not moving and had no heartbeat at 19 weeks. This was a total shock because I had had no symptoms indicating that anything was wrong. My husband, daughter, mother, sister, brother and sister-in-law and two nieces (3.5 and 5) were all there with us. Part of me hated that our families found out like that but I was also relieved that we didn’t have to call them out of the blue to deliver the bad news. </p>

<p>After getting to the hospital and getting checked in to a room on the labor and delivery floor, the doctor did an ultrasound to confirm and noted that he saw some swelling around the baby’s head. He then told us I would be induced with Cytotec (misoprostol), given vaginally every 6 hours. They said I would probably be there for a day or two. After just two doses, our baby was born at 6:15am on February 4, 2018, less than 9 hours after the process was started. It was then that we learned that we had a son. The OB noticed that the umbilical cord was a bit thinner than normal where it connected to the baby. Thankfully, I didn’t have to push at all because the thought of doing so was quite scary to me for some reason, especially since I’d had a c-section with my daughter and had no idea what to expect. I don’t remember much else that happened during the delivery or for several hours afterwards since I was still groggy from Ambien (sleeping medicine) and Stadol (pain medicine). I was given both of these medications when I’m sure everyone thought the delivery was a long way off still. Part of me regrets that I don’t remember more since that was the only memories I’ll ever have with my son but part of me thinks perhaps it was a blessing as it was by far the most difficult experience I’ve ever had. </p>

<p>We didn’t get any answers as to what exactly happened. We weren’t offered to have testing done in the hospital and by the time we realized it, it was too late. My doctor proactively ordered lab work to test me for clotting disorders. The results should be in next week. </p>

<p>Tomorrow will be three weeks and I feel like I’ve been on a rollercoaster emotionally. The next several months will be hard with my due date approaching and the addition of a new niece to our family who will always be the same age that my son should be. On top of that, a close friend of mine is pregnant with twins. My husband and I want to try again right away and got the ok from my doctor after my first period. I’m scared that it will take a long time to conceive again and I know another pregnancy will be so difficult after this but I’m fighting to remain hopeful. </p>

I tested positive on Father's Day and got to give him the happy news... yeah, that perfect.

When I was about 9 weeks along I started streaking pink when I wiped, and then the bleeding came. We were panicking and rushed to the ER to find out that I had a subchorionic hematoma.

My OB does a blood test to check for chromosomal abnormalities as well as the gender at 9 weeks, so I had that test done which came back inconclusive. This was considered normal as sometimes there's not enough fetal DNA in the mothers blood at that point, so we retested at 12 weeks with the same result.

We chose not to find out the sex after everything was said and done, even when we were called back to confirm the diagnosis via the amnio results.

And now here we are. The baby was due Feb 28, just 5 days from now. I should be a giant beach ball complaining about aches and bloat and dying to go into labor, instead all I feel is this intense emptiness in the place where life once was.

On Tuesday we had what was supposed to be our first ob visit and discovered that the pregnancy was no longer viable. (This is our fourth miscarriage). They offered expectant management but I knew i wanted it over so scheduled a termination for yesterday afternoon. It was really hard and so shitty but it was fast and now it’s over. Feeling very much relieved. I wanted to take a little time and write my (someone positive) termination without anesthesia story because the internet is awash with really crappy stories. This is somewhat detailed so trigger warning ahead. But I couldn’t find anything that wasn’t doomsday levels of fear inducing. 

When I was the midwife on Tuesday she told me I was absolutely a candidate for a termination without anesthesia. She told me it is tough but so am I. The cost savings and the speed of procedure without anesthesia were big pros for me. She gave me my consent form and prescribed meds for me. I asked for Xanax to help with anxiety. I absolutely 100% recommend this. I had never had Xanax before and found it hugely helpful. 

About two hours before the procedure, I was so nervous that I started vomiting. The internet is full of people who say it was the worst thing that has ever happened to them. Honestly, it wasn’t fun and it was very painful but it lasts for only a few minutes. I took antibiotics. An hour before the procedure I took a Xanax. I could feel it kicking in within 10-15 minutes and I felt my body calm right down. Then, in car ride over, I took two norcos, an ibuprofen and a med to help with nausea.

When I arrived,  I asked to wait in a treatment room and not in waiting room. Honestly- they can almost always make this happen and it is the best. There is no reason for you to have to wait with pregnant women when you’re experiencing a loss. They met me and took my vitals and asked me to use restroom and got me settled into a room with my husband. The doctor came in and told me what was about to happen.

I asked several questions: will I have to see anything? No. I explained that I didn’t want to see anything at all. Can I listen to music? Absolutely. Can you insert an IUD? Yes. I told him that I was feeling very sad and would likely cry and he said that it was ok. He told me when to stop him and to try and stay so still.

Then we started. I undressed from waist down except for socks and put headphones on. I can not recommend them enough. I put my legs up in stirrups. He inserted a speculum and clamped my cervix. (No pain). Then he did two shots of anesthesia to my cervix. A little cramping.

We waited a few minutes for them to take effect and then the procedure began. This part wasnt very uncomfortable to start. Then it became Deeply crampy and I could feel/hear the suctioning. I was blown away by how deeply it hurt (as in, in my uterus- I had an unmedicated vaginal induction in 2015- this is nothin in comparison)(manageable; just like “I stubbed my toe and dropped my phone on it at the same time and very intense, but the emotional pain was very bad) and was about to ask to take a break when they told me it was almost done. I closed my eyes and counted back from ten and it was over. I cried during the procedure. They checked to make sure I wasn’t bleeding excessively. I told them that I couldn’t have the IUD inserted today (I was done). and had me lay down on bed for 10-15 minutes. My husband got me a cool cloth for my forehead and I experienced some bad cramping which went away in less than ten minutes. We packed a thermos of juice and I had some when I sat up. My husband helped me get dressed and less than 15 minutes after procedure we left.

It was hard (but more emotionally hard than physically. But this week has been so hard emotionally that 🤷‍♀️). It was so fast. The doctor was so kind to me. I took one more norco when the first set wore off and since that no pain and very little bleeding. I spent afternoon under my heating pad and being waited on hand and foot. 

I’m so glad I elected to have an in-office termination and I hope this helps a woman who is making a decision. The midwife said the big factor is motivation. For me, I wanted to be at home as quickly as I could be and with my family. I wanted my husband to be there. I wanted to have it be a low stress experience. So in office was a good choice for me.

Warning this will be long! And triggery. 
So unfortunately for me, my induction did not go as smoothly as we would of hoped.
We had our consult Monday where we went through what would happen and I was given mifegyne to shut down the placenta.
I then returned to the hospital Wednesday lunch to start the induction with misoprostol. Having had this before my D&C’s I was not too keen on the idea and was vocal about requiring pain relief. At first the nurse was reluctant but after reading my notes gave me oral morphine. Unfortunately this didn’t do much so moved to IV morphine. I had been given 3 doses of misoprostol by this point without much happening, and I was starting to worry how long it was going to take. Luckily things started moving a bit about an hour after the third dose and I delivered the baby fairly quickly. The nurses were amazing and respected our wishes to not see anything (baby was beginning to deteriorate due to dying over a week before) or know the sex. I was actually really surprised at how easily this part went and how relieved I felt. 
The pain really subsided at this point and they put me on some other IV drug to encourage the uterus to release the placenta. Unfortunately this did not go to plan, my temp began to rise and had a couple of uncomfortable physical exams. They managed to manually remove most of the placenta but given my fever, bleeding and risk of retained products they sent me to theatre at 3am.
It sounds like a  horrific experience when I write it out but my husband was by my side the whole way and all the staff were amazing, and answered all my annoying questions. This coupled with having had surgery before helped it not be as traumatic.
So I stayed in hospital for an extra night for an iron infusion and IV antibiotics, but happily left just before lunch Friday. 

For anyone reading this before going through the same thing please remember this is probably a worse case scenario. My body just seems to respond dramatically to drugs and doesn’t want to let pregnancies go. 

As for the whole grieving process. We decided not to see or find out the sex. I know others don’t, but I find it hard to think of the actual baby.  Possibly due to our previous losses making us disconnected. I grieve for the idea of what this baby could have been and the few plans we had made for it, and I’m not sure seeing would help that. I also grieve our hopes to have a family and all the anxiety that future pregnancies will bring. We are getting momentos made, I’m not 100% sure what they are but better to have them packed away than not at all. 
We decided to go with cremation and they get scattered in a special area at the local memorial gardens. 

Now is time to rest and reflect. We have been referred to a repeat loss clinic by our GP and will have a few weeks wait for results from the hospital. The next few months will just be for us, no baby making pressure.

A close friend just found out at her NT scan that the baby has a series of abnormalities that she was told are incompatible with life. They went in today for a follow up with a genetic counselor and a CVS. They were told that although the baby is alive and growing, there’s only a 5% chance of surviving to term and if he survives birth he’d require tens of grueling surgeries, after which he’d live probably only 18 months or less. They don’t think they can cope with that for a number of reasons, including a young and impressionable LC. That said she’s really struggling with the decision to TFMR and would feel most comfortable with an induction but apparently the doctor she saw said they don’t do that until 24 weeks (NY). Is this accurate? 

Are there any resources that would be of use to her in advance and after a TFMR? I know there’s a great Facebook support group but welcome any other suggestions.  

Also what can I as a friend do to help her through this - I’ve been watching her LC so she can go to appointments and offering words of comfort and support where I can but it’s such a tough position I struggle to find the right thing to say. Our LC are a month apart and I am due just 5 weeks before she is. So I’m not sure if my presence itself may be a trigger and how fine a line to walk.

I just received the results of their chromosomal testing, trisomy 13 and they were most likely identical twin girls. Everything is raw still, we wanted girls so badly, my husband is an identical twin so it hit hard that their lives were not meant to be. We are waiting for our genetics counseling appointment in March. We are waiting to try but of course I refuse birth control and my husband refuses condoms and didn’t pull out every time. We are educated but irresponsible at this point, no excuses. 

Last Tuesday my urine pregnancy tests were still very faint positive from my pregnancy. I used the amazon one and a Walmart one. Both very faint. I had blood work at my follow up OB appt on Wednesday and I was told I was not pregnant (I was not given my hcg level). Yesterday I started spotting which I read after a tmfr, a period will be very light. I am crazy hopeful and neurotic despite being a nurse and knowing I shouldn’t hope, the little girl that just wants my baby inside of me is so hopeful it is implantation bleeding. I know it’s not so I took a test this morning to help ease my mind. The Walmart test was positive, not super dark but definitely pink and not really faint like the one last week. I didn’t use a fmu. I took a First Response (because my bathroom is a pharmacy with multiple tests just waiting for use) and it was extremely faint but this one I didn’t have much urine left in me so I didn’t soak it like I would have liked. 

So here I am, I know it is likely just a chemical pregnancy, in my heart of hearts I pray (and I’m not a praying kind of girl) that it’s for real. I’m scared I didn’t give my body time to recover. I’m scared I’ll be so disappointed when the lines disappear in a few days. I know I can’t tell my husband because it will just hurt both of us when I realize it isn’t real. I have no symptoms, and I’ve had a chemical pregnancy before and I know how upsetting it is going to be but I can’t help but be just the slightest bit hopeful. All I have is hope.
