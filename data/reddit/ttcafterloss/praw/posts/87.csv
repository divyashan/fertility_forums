We went off BC in June 2019, were NTNP the first cycle. It was normal, 31 days. The next one was only 21 days, then 22 days. Then two weeks after that period I had heavy bleeding, thought it was another period on CD14. I tested a week after that (I still don't know what made me do that) and got BFP. Went to doctor, was 5 week pregnant according to ultrasound. All my consecutive ultrasounds confirmed that timeline or even corrected it to be a bit *further*.

So my bleeding on CD14 was clearly not period, but even the period before that doesn't make sense. If I was 5 weeks pregnant in the US, I must have ovulated 3 weeks before that. But that's when I had my period. Should be impossible. So there's only two possibilities:

\- I ovulated very soon after my period and the scan was slightly off. Then I had heavy bleeding a week after that for whatever reason.

\- My two last periods were both fake periods. I ovulated before my ""period"" and that was something else (miscarrying an early twin? It's far-fetched but I can't come up with anything else), as well as the CD14 bleeding.

I'm sorry if I break any rules, I did read them but please let me know if I need to edit or remove anything. 

I had a MMC at 9+6 when we had an emergency scan on 26th November, it had stopped growing at around 6 weeks, and had a D&c on 6th December. My husband and I were devastated and December was an awful month for us. All our announcements were planned around the holidays so we decided to cancel Christmas and just drink wine and way cheese at home. 

I had a bit of an ordeal a week and a half after the d&c where it turns out they missed something during the surgery and I passed that naturally so my hormones had a bit of a delay coming back down. Blood tests 2 days apart last week confirmed hcg was down to 29 so hopefully not too much longer before it reaches 0.

I had ewcm last week and thought I was ovulating so did an opk which was near peak, but since then they've been faint, so either I ovulated and missed it or my body is being a troll as usual.

<p>I&#39;m sorry if I break any rules, I did read them but please let me know if I need to edit or remove anything. </p>

<p>I had a MMC at 9+6 when we had an emergency scan on 26th November, it had stopped growing at around 6 weeks, and had a D&amp;c on 6th December. My husband and I were devastated and December was an awful month for us. All our announcements were planned around the holidays so we decided to cancel Christmas and just drink wine and way cheese at home. </p>

<p>I had a bit of an ordeal a week and a half after the d&amp;c where it turns out they missed something during the surgery and I passed that naturally so my hormones had a bit of a delay coming back down. Blood tests 2 days apart last week confirmed hcg was down to 29 so hopefully not too much longer before it reaches 0.</p>

<p>I had ewcm last week and thought I was ovulating so did an opk which was near peak, but since then they&#39;ve been faint, so either I ovulated and missed it or my body is being a troll as usual.</p>

<p>Anyway that was a long rant. Idk what I need. Just having a bad day.</p>

55,2048,confidence,<praw.reddit.Reddit object at 0x7f12a630cd90>,,ttcafterloss,"Hi, longtime lurker, first time posting (here and on Reddit!). Please let me know if I have made a faux pas so I can fix it. I'm trying to write this while keeping an eye on the sub rules in another tab. Also, I apologize in advance for how long-winded this is. But **TLDR: RPL/AMH/FSH/hysteroscopy/HSG/prolactin/TSH/lining/periods/immunity to MMR/husband's SA and counts normal, but 4 basically back-to-back CPs without any successes.** Typically, I do not even get a positive test til 14dpo which I know is late and could signify poor quality embryos, but this many times in a row? Is this shitty quality eggs, or truly bad luck?

Background: My husband (39M) and I (32F) have been married for \~3 years, trying for about 1.5 years with a diagnosis of unexplained and no children for either of us. From May 2018 to May 2019, we tried on our own with no luck. After seeing an RE and doing initial testing (AMH=2.55, FSH=7.2, prolactin normal but forget value, AFC=16, tubes patent, TSH brought down from 3.75 to 1.19, LP kind of short at 10-11 days, ovulation usually around CD18/Vit D brought from 12 to 36 with those 10,000 IU weekly pills) we do **IUI 1**: a trigger + IUI, which results in my first CP. Totally fine, I thought it was a fluke. My cycle takes a while to regulate but HCG slowly gets to 5, then we somehow randomly conceive on our own. After initially normal betas, levels start to rise more slowly around the 200 mark, topping out at \~480. They then take forever to go back down and reduce irregularly, so my RE thought this could be ectopic but too small to see on an u/s, but luckily over a month levels go back to 0. I then go on BCP for a few weeks in preparation for a hysteroscopy. Hysteroscopy, which did NOT feel good, was normal -- no polyps, septum, adhesions, etc. Go on to do **IUI 2** with clomid + trigger + progesterone, the only one that has no brief success, which I think is because another RE did this one and had me trigger with one follicle at 15 mm only. Next cycle we go on to **IUI 3** with clomid + Gonal-F + trigger + progesterone, everything looks perfect with 4 >18 mm follicles and lining of 7.84 mm and husband's TMC at around 32 M post-wash -- you guessed it, another CP! This is number three for those keeping score.

Finally, my RE allows me to do some RPL testing. Husband's and my karyotyping comes back normal, I have no APA/lupus anticoagulant/factor V/hgba1c/progesterone (13.89 CD21 non-med cycle, \~57 CD 21 clomid/IUI cycle) issues. My RE does not believe in immunological stuff so I'm SOL with testing there. Husband is set to do DNA frag test next week. Since everything from the RPL was normal, we go on to **IUI 4** with clomid + Gonal-F + trigger + progesterone, 5 follicles >18 mm and lining at 9 mm, great count's on husband's side, AND get the selective reduction caution (lol, ok). This time, I get a veryyyy faint positive at 10 dpo...which quickly fades away by 13 dpo. Waiting on beta from this morning (15 dpo) but hoping this doesn't linger and hcg quickly falls to 1.

So in summary: pending DNA frag results, we are hardcore in the unexplained territory. My RE is content to keep letting us do IUIs til the end of time since technically we do keep briefly having success and she thinks it could just be we have a few more poor quality sperm/eggs than normal. No reason to suspect endo as my periods are total non-events and I have none of the other symptoms (except, of course, IF). Husband and I could both stand to lost a bit of weight but I don't think are in the category of having that play a significant role; I do OTF 4x weekly and eat pretty well/I limit caffeine to one 12 oz cup a day; but I am firmly a 2 glasses of red wine or beer a night person. I had initially slowed down on the wine but my RE's attitude is very much that that is unlikely to have any effect in this case. Also, I should add that our insurance only covers u/s and some bloodwork, but nothing else...so each found of injectable IUI is \~1,200 OOP, but IVF would be...roughly \~32,000 from what I  could calculate. This would not ruin us but...we couldn't exactly write a check tomorrow, either.

I kind of want to keep rolling the dice with IUIs  because it seems silly to me to do IVF with PGT when we don't even know what is causing the CPs in the first place and whether it is something addressable. I agree that two CPs in a row is likely due to chance, but is the same true for four in a row without any successes in between? As I type this, I realized I suspected a CP in Nov 2018 prior to any medical intervention, so that would be five CPs. I am taking: coq-10 (400 mg/daily), baby aspirin, Vit B, synthroid 75 mcg, DHEA (50 mg/daily), DHA, prenatal, and self-medicated with a low dose of prednisone the last cycle. All to no avail. Husband just started taking Vits C/D/E, as well as selenium and zinc. I am going to ask for lovenox and letrozole (in lieu of clomid) next cycle bc why not, but am I missing anything? A lap has been deemed firmly out of the question by my RE bc I have zero reason to think I have anything but even an unexpected case of silent endo, which she said would likely not be severe enough to be the main cause.

I would love any insight folks could provide, or any suggestions for areas I have not yet explored/testing I've not undergone. I get the sense that unless we move into IVF, my RE is not going to do a bunch of digging into our case and just chalks it up to the world's worst luck. My husband just started a new job and works a ton so IVF is not currently an option until his schedule kind of settles down. But are we wasting our time with IUI until we can move to IVF? I feel like the fact that I almost always have a positive test following an ART cycle but one that clearly results from late implantation is significant, but if it were just poor quality eggs wouldn't that be reflected a bit in my AMH/FSH/response to injectables? Sorry again for the lengthy post but thanks so much for letting me vent and pick your brains. I don't know anyone going through this IRL so I find a lot of comfort reading about others going through the same hell.

But <strong>TLDR: RPL/AMH/FSH/hysteroscopy/HSG/prolactin/TSH/lining/periods/immunity to MMR/husband&#39;s SA and counts normal, but 4 basically back-to-back CPs without any successes.</strong> Typically, I do not even get a positive test til 14dpo which I know is late and could signify poor quality embryos, but this many times in a row? Is this shitty quality eggs, or truly bad luck?</p>

<p>Background: My husband (39M) and I (32F) have been married for ~3 years, trying for about 1.5 years with a diagnosis of unexplained and no children for either of us. From May 2018 to May 2019, we tried on our own with no luck. After seeing an RE and doing initial testing (AMH=2.55, FSH=7.2, prolactin normal but forget value, AFC=16, tubes patent, TSH brought down from 3.75 to 1.19, LP kind of short at 10-11 days, ovulation usually around CD18/Vit D brought from 12 to 36 with those 10,000 IU weekly pills) we do <strong>IUI 1</strong>: a trigger + IUI, which results in my first CP. Totally fine, I thought it was a fluke. My cycle takes a while to regulate but HCG slowly gets to 5, then we somehow randomly conceive on our own. After initially normal betas, levels start to rise more slowly around the 200 mark, topping out at ~480. They then take forever to go back down and reduce irregularly, so my RE thought this could be ectopic but too small to see on an <a href=""/u/s"">u/s</a>, but luckily over a month levels go back to 0. I then go on BCP for a few weeks in preparation for a hysteroscopy. Hysteroscopy, which did NOT feel good, was normal -- no polyps, septum, adhesions, etc. Go on to do <strong>IUI 2</strong> with clomid + trigger + progesterone, the only one that has no brief success, which I think is because another RE did this one and had me trigger with one follicle at 15 mm only. Next cycle we go on to <strong>IUI 3</strong> with clomid + Gonal-F + trigger + progesterone, everything looks perfect with 4 &gt;18 mm follicles and lining of 7.84 mm and husband&#39;s TMC at around 32 M post-wash -- you guessed it, another CP! This is number three for those keeping score.</p>

<p>Finally, my RE allows me to do some RPL testing. Husband&#39;s and my karyotyping comes back normal, I have no APA/lupus anticoagulant/factor V/hgba1c/progesterone (13.89 CD21 non-med cycle, ~57 CD 21 clomid/IUI cycle) issues. My RE does not believe in immunological stuff so I&#39;m SOL with testing there. Husband is set to do DNA frag test next week. Since everything from the RPL was normal, we go on to <strong>IUI 4</strong> with clomid + Gonal-F + trigger + progesterone, 5 follicles &gt;18 mm and lining at 9 mm, great count&#39;s on husband&#39;s side, AND get the selective reduction caution (lol, ok). This time, I get a veryyyy faint positive at 10 dpo...which quickly fades away by 13 dpo. Waiting on beta from this morning (15 dpo) but hoping this doesn&#39;t linger and hcg quickly falls to 1.</p>

<p>So in summary: pending DNA frag results, we are hardcore in the unexplained territory. My RE is content to keep letting us do IUIs til the end of time since technically we do keep briefly having success and she thinks it could just be we have a few more poor quality sperm/eggs than normal. No reason to suspect endo as my periods are total non-events and I have none of the other symptoms (except, of course, IF). Husband and I could both stand to lost a bit of weight but I don&#39;t think are in the category of having that play a significant role; I do OTF 4x weekly and eat pretty well/I limit caffeine to one 12 oz cup a day; but I am firmly a 2 glasses of red wine or beer a night person. I had initially slowed down on the wine but my RE&#39;s attitude is very much that that is unlikely to have any effect in this case. Also, I should add that our insurance only covers <a href=""/u/s"">u/s</a> and some bloodwork, but nothing else...so each found of injectable IUI is ~1,200 OOP, but IVF would be...roughly ~32,000 from what I  could calculate. This would not ruin us but...we couldn&#39;t exactly write a check tomorrow, either.</p>

<p>I kind of want to keep rolling the dice with IUIs  because it seems silly to me to do IVF with PGT when we don&#39;t even know what is causing the CPs in the first place and whether it is something addressable. I agree that two CPs in a row is likely due to chance, but is the same true for four in a row without any successes in between? As I type this, I realized I suspected a CP in Nov 2018 prior to any medical intervention, so that would be five CPs. I am taking: coq-10 (400 mg/daily), baby aspirin, Vit B, synthroid 75 mcg, DHEA (50 mg/daily), DHA, prenatal, and self-medicated with a low dose of prednisone the last cycle. All to no avail. Husband just started taking Vits C/D/E, as well as selenium and zinc. I am going to ask for lovenox and letrozole (in lieu of clomid) next cycle bc why not, but am I missing anything? A lap has been deemed firmly out of the question by my RE bc I have zero reason to think I have anything but even an unexpected case of silent endo, which she said would likely not be severe enough to be the main cause.</p>

<p>I would love any insight folks could provide, or any suggestions for areas I have not yet explored/testing I&#39;ve not undergone. I get the sense that unless we move into IVF, my RE is not going to do a bunch of digging into our case and just chalks it up to the world&#39;s worst luck. My husband just started a new job and works a ton so IVF is not currently an option until his schedule kind of settles down. But are we wasting our time with IUI until we can move to IVF? I feel like the fact that I almost always have a positive test following an ART cycle but one that clearly results from late implantation is significant, but if it were just poor quality eggs wouldn&#39;t that be reflected a bit in my AMH/FSH/response to injectables? Sorry again for the lengthy post but thanks so much for letting me vent and pick your brains. I don&#39;t know anyone going through this IRL so I find a lot of comfort reading about others going through the same hell.</p>

63,2048,confidence,<praw.reddit.Reddit object at 0x7f12a630cd90>,,ttcafterloss,"I’m just so angry with the doctors and healthcare professionals I’ve dealt with this Christmas. 

In early December I had some brown spotting and rang my EPU, they assured me that brown bleeding was common in pregnancy and at my dating scan the sonographer said that it was ok. I was 7+4. 

Two weeks later at another scan we saw the heartbeat. I cried with happiness. My family was complete with this little bub inside me. 

Christmas Eve the brown spotting turned heavier, the midwife on the phone assured me again that this was normal and not to worry and they would see me on January 20th. 


Christmas Day, I stood up from our kitchen table and I felt blood running down my leg. Again, I rang the hospital and they told me it was normal and ok and not to worry unless it was “heavy”. I asked if blood running down my leg was not considered heavy and she said I could come in _if I wanted_ 

30 minutes later I arrived at the hospital.
They performed an internal scan and found it hard to locate baby. 
My heart sank. 
The junior doctor called her senior and together they located our little baby. 
My heart sank further when baby didn’t look any different to the scan two weeks previous 

I couldn’t look at the screen, I knew in my heart that our baby had passed. 
They assured us that baby was ok and bleeding was normal in some pregnancies. They said they saw a heartbeat. It didn’t look like the heart beat I saw previous. 

I cried myself to sleep that night. My husband couldn’t understand why I didn’t believe the doctors. He couldn’t understand that I didn’t *feel* pregnant anymore. 


On the 27th I returned to the EPU and begged and pleaded to be scanned again by the original sonographer. She was reluctant to scan me due to her busy schedule (understandable) but when she saw my teary face I think she found it hard to turn me away, as much as she told me that bleeding was normal and she remembered telling me to expect some bleeding, I pleaded to have her scan me one more time. 

My husband and I held hands tightly as she confirmed that there was no heartbeat. 
She held my other hand as I sobbed. Tears rolling into my ears. 

She gave us a moment together while she called a doctor in to confirm. Standard procedure. 


The doctor then explained our options: 
Conservative management 
Medical management 
Surgical management. 


I asked to have a think at home and weigh up our options. 

Two days later I rang the maternity unit and explained to the nurse that I would prefer to have surgical management. 
My husband was returning to work on January 2nd. I was returning to work January 6th. We had a 9 month old baby too. Surgical management made for a better choice. 

The midwife explained that during the weekend the surgical team wouldn’t be able available for non-emergency surgery and to come back over to the EPU on Monday and they would refer me over. 

On Monday I packed a bag, I arranged for our daughter to stay with my MIL. 
We arrived at the EPU and again the sonographer met us with a raised brow. We explained that we’d like a D&C and she somewhat scoffed at the idea and explained that with New Year’s Eve, and New Year’s Day approaching, she wouldn’t be referring me for surgery today, nor tomorrow and she could see what way they were available on the 2nd. 

She asked me to go empty my bladder for another internal scan, she assured me that I had passed 90% of the pregnancy matter, and that a surgical option was moot at this point and reassured us that this pregnancy was the case of an incomplete amount of chromosomes and was very common and she would see us soon with another pregnancy. She recommended paracetamol and some rest and to come back on January 6th to confirm I had passed the “other 10%”. 

I didn’t remember passing any large clots or particularly heavy bleeding so I left more confused than I went in. 

We once again left to go home and I continued to bleed. 

Fast forward to New Year’s Eve. 
I was feeding our daughter some dinner and was struggling with some very heavy cramping. I was ok with this pain. I took it as a punishment for not being able to carry this baby. It was like early labour pains and just assumed they would go away. 

When I stood up from the dining table the blood hit the floor. Bear in mind I was wearing a night time pad (changed 20 minutes prior), large knickers, and yoga pants, yet the blood literally went *splat* on the floor. 

I rang my husband and asked him to come home as I was feeling weak and he was just 5km away in a friends house. 

I rang the maternity unit just to confirm that this was ok. They said that if I was soaking a pad in under an hour to come in for observation, but as they were on a skeleton crew, I could be waiting some time. 

I dribbling blood over a toilet bowl for 30 mins before showering. In the shower I pulled a large clot, the size of lambs liver, from my vagina. I felt nauseous looking at it in my hand. I calmly flushed the matter in the toilet and returned to the shower. 
Over the next three hours I experienced pains worse than labour. With every contraction my body passed more clots. My husband eventually convinced me to go to the hospital. 

The doctors (the same doctors that “confirmed” I was still pregnant Christmas Day) checked me with a speculum and agreed that I had a “clot” blocking my cervix and asked permission to remove it. 
The pain went away almost instantly. I thanked the doctors and redressed. 
Morbid curiosity wanted to see the size of the clot that was causing my labour pains. They left the rolled up spill pad in the top of the hazardous waste bin. When I peeled back the blue plastic I went white. 


It was my baby. In the gestational sac. It was the size of a tennis ball. I felt sick. The blood drained from my face. 

In situations, I am always the calmer one. I don’t tend to panic, my husband on the other hand, has Anxiety and is more emotional and dramatic than I would be. 

I couldn’t tell him what I saw. I simply said it was a large clot and that was enough for him. 


My baby was in that blue plastic spill pad. In a bin. 


That night the bleeding eased. 
Last night I woke with excruciating pains again, but I passed two large clots in our bathroom. I didn’t see them clearly but they were each the size of a mandarin orange. 


How was it that the sonographer said I had passed 90% of the pregnancy, so there was no need for surgical intervention, yet days later I was staring at our baby in a bin. 
Days later I crawled around, writhing in pain, haemorrhaging blood all over my house.

<p>In early December I had some brown spotting and rang my EPU, they assured me that brown bleeding was common in pregnancy and at my dating scan the sonographer said that it was ok. I was 7+4. </p>

<p>Two weeks later at another scan we saw the heartbeat. I cried with happiness. My family was complete with this little bub inside me. </p>

<p>Christmas Eve the brown spotting turned heavier, the midwife on the phone assured me again that this was normal and not to worry and they would see me on January 20th. </p>

<p>Christmas Day, I stood up from our kitchen table and I felt blood running down my leg. Again, I rang the hospital and they told me it was normal and ok and not to worry unless it was “heavy”. I asked if blood running down my leg was not considered heavy and she said I could come in <em>if I wanted</em> </p>

<p>30 minutes later I arrived at the hospital.
They performed an internal scan and found it hard to locate baby. 
My heart sank. 
The junior doctor called her senior and together they located our little baby. 
My heart sank further when baby didn’t look any different to the scan two weeks previous </p>

<p>I couldn’t look at the screen, I knew in my heart that our baby had passed. 
They assured us that baby was ok and bleeding was normal in some pregnancies. They said they saw a heartbeat. It didn’t look like the heart beat I saw previous. </p>

<p>I cried myself to sleep that night. My husband couldn’t understand why I didn’t believe the doctors. He couldn’t understand that I didn’t <em>feel</em> pregnant anymore. </p>

<p>On the 27th I returned to the EPU and begged and pleaded to be scanned again by the original sonographer. She was reluctant to scan me due to her busy schedule (understandable) but when she saw my teary face I think she found it hard to turn me away, as much as she told me that bleeding was normal and she remembered telling me to expect some bleeding, I pleaded to have her scan me one more time. </p>

<p>My husband and I held hands tightly as she confirmed that there was no heartbeat. 
She held my other hand as I sobbed. Tears rolling into my ears. </p>

<p>She gave us a moment together while she called a doctor in to confirm. Standard procedure. </p>

<p>The doctor then explained our options: 
Conservative management 
Medical management 
Surgical management. </p>

<p>I asked to have a think at home and weigh up our options. </p>

<p>Two days later I rang the maternity unit and explained to the nurse that I would prefer to have surgical management. 
My husband was returning to work on January 2nd. I was returning to work January 6th. We had a 9 month old baby too. Surgical management made for a better choice. </p>

<p>The midwife explained that during the weekend the surgical team wouldn’t be able available for non-emergency surgery and to come back over to the EPU on Monday and they would refer me over. </p>

<p>On Monday I packed a bag, I arranged for our daughter to stay with my MIL. 
We arrived at the EPU and again the sonographer met us with a raised brow. We explained that we’d like a D&amp;C and she somewhat scoffed at the idea and explained that with New Year’s Eve, and New Year’s Day approaching, she wouldn’t be referring me for surgery today, nor tomorrow and she could see what way they were available on the 2nd. </p>

<p>She asked me to go empty my bladder for another internal scan, she assured me that I had passed 90% of the pregnancy matter, and that a surgical option was moot at this point and reassured us that this pregnancy was the case of an incomplete amount of chromosomes and was very common and she would see us soon with another pregnancy. She recommended paracetamol and some rest and to come back on January 6th to confirm I had passed the “other 10%”. </p>

<p>I didn’t remember passing any large clots or particularly heavy bleeding so I left more confused than I went in. </p>

<p>We once again left to go home and I continued to bleed. </p>

<p>Fast forward to New Year’s Eve. 
I was feeding our daughter some dinner and was struggling with some very heavy cramping. I was ok with this pain. I took it as a punishment for not being able to carry this baby. It was like early labour pains and just assumed they would go away. </p>

<p>When I stood up from the dining table the blood hit the floor. Bear in mind I was wearing a night time pad (changed 20 minutes prior), large knickers, and yoga pants, yet the blood literally went <em>splat</em> on the floor. </p>

<p>I rang my husband and asked him to come home as I was feeling weak and he was just 5km away in a friends house. </p>

<p>I rang the maternity unit just to confirm that this was ok. They said that if I was soaking a pad in under an hour to come in for observation, but as they were on a skeleton crew, I could be waiting some time. </p>

<p>I dribbling blood over a toilet bowl for 30 mins before showering. In the shower I pulled a large clot, the size of lambs liver, from my vagina. I felt nauseous looking at it in my hand. I calmly flushed the matter in the toilet and returned to the shower. 
Over the next three hours I experienced pains worse than labour. With every contraction my body passed more clots. My husband eventually convinced me to go to the hospital. </p>

<p>The doctors (the same doctors that “confirmed” I was still pregnant Christmas Day) checked me with a speculum and agreed that I had a “clot” blocking my cervix and asked permission to remove it. 
The pain went away almost instantly. I thanked the doctors and redressed. 
Morbid curiosity wanted to see the size of the clot that was causing my labour pains. They left the rolled up spill pad in the top of the hazardous waste bin. When I peeled back the blue plastic I went white. </p>

<p>It was my baby. In the gestational sac. It was the size of a tennis ball. I felt sick. The blood drained from my face. </p>

<p>In situations, I am always the calmer one. I don’t tend to panic, my husband on the other hand, has Anxiety and is more emotional and dramatic than I would be. </p>

<p>I couldn’t tell him what I saw. I simply said it was a large clot and that was enough for him. </p>

<p>My baby was in that blue plastic spill pad. In a bin. </p>

<p>That night the bleeding eased. 
Last night I woke with excruciating pains again, but I passed two large clots in our bathroom. I didn’t see them clearly but they were each the size of a mandarin orange. </p>

<p>How was it that the sonographer said I had passed 90% of the pregnancy, so there was no need for surgical intervention, yet days later I was staring at our baby in a bin. 
Days later I crawled around, writhing in pain, haemorrhaging blood all over my house. </p>

<p>I’m so angry. </p>

<p>TL;DR : doctors refused to give D&amp;C then left my baby’s remains in a bin.</p>

One week ago I had an early miscarriage. I was approximately 6 weeks along and honestly if I wasn't trying so hard to conceive I probably wouldn't have clued on to the symptoms and even known I was pregnant. It happened just as an extremely heavy and late period, no medical intervention was necessary and bleeding stopped on the 30th December. 

Now here's the thing, I was previously getting the depo provera shot and I had been off of it for a year and seven months before I actually had a positive ovulation test. I had only just had two periods that were a relatively normal cycle (38 days).
Who would have thought, first ovulation, first try, bam I'm pregnant. God I was so over the moon. 
Now I have no idea what is going to happen. I'm just keeping my fingers and toes crossed I can have a normal cycle again. 

What's the next steps from here? 
Do I count my 38 days from the start of the miscarriage? Or do I just patently wait until I've had my first period after and then start tracking myself from there? (Woohoo ovulation kits!) 
From what I have read so far in this sub is that your period can take longer than the norm the first few times. 
I'm just not sure where to start and my doctor really wasn't overly informative.

73,2048,confidence,<praw.reddit.Reddit object at 0x7f12a630cd90>,,ttcafterloss,"Hi all. My husband and I decided to start trying to get pregnant in February of 2019 and I got pregnant immediately (still oddly a lot of guilt associated with that, even with how it ended). I had a MMC and ended up getting a D&C the day before my birthday in May. Since then we've been ttc without success, but I wouldn't say that we've been as intentional as we could be. I was kind of afraid of trying too hard because I thought that would make the pain of getting my next period even worse. Turns out it hurts either way (ha), so it's a bit of a new year's resolution of mine to be more intentional. My best friend in the world was five months pregnant when I had my miscarriage, so now my Godchild is very present in my life which is so awful and so wonderful.

I decided to finally look for this sub when I realized that there wasn't going to be a day when I woke up and didn't think about the miscarriage at all.

My husband and I decided to start trying to get pregnant in February of 2019 and I got pregnant immediately (still oddly a lot of guilt associated with that, even with how it ended). I had a MMC and ended up getting a D&amp;C the day before my birthday in May. Since then we&#39;ve been ttc without success, but I wouldn&#39;t say that we&#39;ve been as intentional as we could be. I was kind of afraid of trying too hard because I thought that would make the pain of getting my next period even worse. Turns out it hurts either way (ha), so it&#39;s a bit of a new year&#39;s resolution of mine to be more intentional. My best friend in the world was five months pregnant when I had my miscarriage, so now my Godchild is very present in my life which is so awful and so wonderful.</p>

<p>I decided to finally look for this sub when I realized that there wasn&#39;t going to be a day when I woke up and didn&#39;t think about the miscarriage at all. I hate the idea that I&#39;m going to feel broken until I finally someday maybe give birth to a healthy baby, and the only person in my life who went through this (to my knowledge obvs) now has two healthy kids which gives me complicated feelings.</p>

<p>Anyway. Hey. This sub looks really supportive and amazing. Thanks for being here.</p>

I don’t feel like me right now. It’s like at the slightest provocation, I’m ready to fight and cry and carry a grudge for hours. My poor husband is taking the brunt of it and I really notice. This is not like me.

Over the past week, I’ve noticed my “pregnancy” hormones dropping. The bloat is gone, my acne is improving, my hunger has regulated, no nausea or anything. And yet my moods are whacked and I have been sleeping probablu 12-15 hours a day. I’m doing something and then wham - I’m exhausted.

We were at a family gathering where it was clear my husband wanted to leave and I just snapped on him to stop staring at me and let’s effing go even though I wasn’t ready to go. 

At same gathering, my mom said loudly in front of everyone how we really need another baby in the family, staring at me, and then laughed as I walked away. She doesn’t know. And it was on the tip of my tongue to tell her that I tried but it’s fucking dead inside my fucking body and she should STFU. 

We go home and I burst into tears on my husband, saying I don’t know what’s wrong with me, why I’m so tired and so mood-swingy. He’s supportive and he gets me to help with organizing the basement. We get rid of a few things, I feel good, and then when I go to donate my older son’s baby monitor from 11 years ago, and I’m sitting in my section of the storage room feeling overwhelmed by everything, WHAM my energy takes a plunge and I just want to cry.

<p>I’d supposedly ovulate end of January after 3 cycles if the predictions are correct which would be a few days shy of the 3 month mark after the injection, I’ve been using OPKs to track my current ovulation pattern and it seems normal so far. My husband wants me to be extra cautious and get bloodwork done to make sure I’m ready. I’ve been taking prenatals and extra folic acid (1200mg a day) since two weeks after the injection (my hcg dropped fast). Do I just call up my doctor to ask for bloodwork? What would they check for? Enough folic acid and that the MTX is out of my system? Have any of you done the same prior to trying again?

I think I just need someone to talk to about it. Maybe any advice? How long did it take for your period to come back after D&amp;amp;C? 

I’m 26 and was diagnosed with PCOS in 2014, where my specialist looked me in the eyes and told me that I have a very tiny window to have kids but that window is rapidly closing. 

At the time my partner and I decided that we would focus on finishing our degrees to be financially secure before we try for a bub.  

Fast forward to September this year, we have unprotected sex for the first time in our relationship. Soon after we discover we were pregnant! We were over the moon, we confirmed it with two blood tests and watched our HCG levels rise. We told everyone at 5 weeks it was a glorious time. 

At six or so weeks I experienced a huge gush of bleeding. I freaked out and went to the mothers hospital straight away. They did some more blood tests which showed us the levels were raising even further. They even did an ultrasound where we saw Bub and it’s little heartbeat fluttering. We were so relieved. 

The next day I go back to work and receive a letter from my employer informing me that my job as a high school teacher has been redundant and I will have no job come the end of the school year. 

The day after we went for our routine dating ultrasound - which coincidentally was on my partners birthday. There was no heartbeat. I was in disbelief. I paid upfront for a second opinion the very next day because I couldn’t believe it. I had just saw Bubs heartbeat not two days earlier! 

The next few weeks were a blur. Back and forth between more blood tests tracking HCG and scans confirming the pregnancy was non progressive. Phone calls with union reps and consultation meetings with work. 

After 3 weeks my body still had not done its thing to pass Bub. And so we ended up going for a d&amp;amp;c. It has now been over 8 weeks since the procedure and my period still hasn’t come back. 

I just found out that two people in our immediate friendship group are pregnant with one of them being my sister in law who we see every other day. I feel so terrible for not being happy for them, but it breaks my heart so much to know that I’ll have to watch their journey on the timeline that would have been ours... 

I feel completely empty. My partner has been absolutely amazing and supportive through everything. But this experience has been harder than I have ever imagined it could be. I don’t know if I am weaker than everyone else, but I see other people bounce back faster with loses greater than mine. I wasn’t even sure if we could conceive and so Bub felt like a miracle... 

I’ve now got a new job at a better school, but my employer suggested I hold off on having a baby until I get permanency which takes around a year to get. But I’m so torn. I feel like my body is on a clock. Everyone keeps telling me I’m so young and I have plenty of time and I shouldn’t worry. But I feel like time is just going so fast, and I don’t want to blink and it suddenly be too late. I don’t know how long it will take for us to fall pregnant again let alone keep the pregnancy to term. What if it takes us over a year anyway? 

I dunno. I don’t know where I’m going with this. Everything sucks. My 16yo little brother knocked up his 15yo girlfriend, and he’s decided to bail on her until she “can prove it’s his”, and I can’t even begin to explain how ridiculously hurt and angry I am at him, my father for egging him on, and the universe for just being lame. 

My hospital has referred me to grief counseling and I’m definitely going to book that in tomorrow. I really need help navigating this space. I’m hurt, lost, confused and am struggling to see purpose in anything. 

I just want my body to go back to normal so I can close this chapter. I just want my period to come back so I can feel somewhat normal and functional. Should I keep waiting for it or do you guys think I should see my gp and find out what’s going on?

Right around the time we start to try again, my sister tells me she is pregnant. I am of course happy for her, but feeling anxious after our loss. Tracking my ovulation with a kit, I ovulated later in my cycle than I had in the past but I did ovulate. Missed my period on 12/18 but waited to take a test until 12/23 due to late ovulation. I got a positive test and was so excited! My sister calls to tell me her ultrasound that day was great, everything looks awesome, she’s thrilled. I spend Christmas excited that we have number 2 on the way again and tell my family since it’s obvious I’m not drinking wine. Everyone celebrates that my sister and I will have due dates 1 month apart. Yesterday, 12/26, I started to spot and it got worse as the day went on. This morning I woke up and bleeding was worse.

I was also very sick and they admitted me for sepsis and pneumonia. I saw baby on the ultrasound with a strong heartbeat. He was kicking and waved at us. As the day went on my cramps got worse. Then they came in waves getting worse and worse. I knew I was in labor but somehow my mind couldn’t actually process it. I went to the bathroom and my baby fell out. I had to push out the placenta. It was traumatic and more heartbreaking than I could have imagined. We were in the “safe” zone. 

I was healthy! I’m 30, I carried and delivered a healthy baby over 2 years ago. I eat really well, drink lots of water, exercise, and avoid anything that could potentially harm a baby.

I hadn’t had my period in three years, and I have stomach issues so I live with constant nausea and vomiting. I didn’t know I was pregnant for a while, so prior to finding out I was drinking and smoking. I was hurting my baby and didn’t even know. I also didn’t have health insurance, so once I found out, I struggled to find a free clinic near me. I eventually found one, and the earliest appointment was several weeks away. In the meanwhile, I started to eat better, sleep better, and take prenatal vitamins. I genuinely had no clue how far along I was because the weeks after my assault were tough. I estimated myself to be around 3 months.

A few weeks after finding out I was pregnant, I started bleeding excessively. My baby stopped moving. I just knew I was having a miscarriage, so I shut down. I only left my dorm room to go to class. All I did was sob in my room. A week after I started bleeding, my water broke. I still refused to go to the hospital because I didn’t think they’d let me hold my baby. I was ready to give birth in my dorm.

My friends eventually convinced me to go to the hospital. I agreed to go once my contractions were closer together. There was a hockey game that night and I told them to go and I’d call if anything happened. I didn’t call, I took an uber to the hospital where they immediately took me to the back. A nurse came in to do an ultrasound and I just kept praying that I was wrong, that my baby would have a heartbeat. My baby did have a heartbeat. My baby was also a girl. She also had gastroschisis.  I was also 23 weeks along, not the 13 weeks that I previously thought I was.

The doctors then examined me and determined I was too far along in labor to stop it. I gave birth on October 4, 2019 to a beautiful baby girl. I named her Violet. I held her and kissed her forehead and lover her. Holding her, I thought that I could survive this. She later died in my arms. When the nurses took her away, they took me away too. I died right there with her. I couldn’t survive this. My daughter is dead and nothing will bring her back.

One more week of pregnancy and I would’ve had to file a birth and death certificate. My friends say this would’ve been harder in the long run, but I don’t think so. My baby died with me being the only one who loved her. Atleast if she had a birth certificate, there would be some proof she existed. All I have is her ultrasound, and one photo of her.

Violet was taken away to do genetic testing to see why my body rejected the pregnancy, and why she has gastroschisis. I was delirious and sad and told the nurses I didn’t want the results, but that was lost in translation. That’s Florida for you. I was later called with the results: my baby has Trisomy 13. She was broken before she even had a chance to be whole. She was in pain before she was born. I live with chronic abdominal pain, and this all just feels like a cruel joke. 

It’s been almost 3 months, and there’s been no change to my pain. Everyday feels like a living death. I try to smile and act normal more so I don’t make people feel uncomfortable.

And since then not a single mention about it. While that is personal, I am so thankful. I know they were heartbroken too, while they have their quirks, they are “just yes” in laws. There is no way they didn’t spread the word. I was dreading the 3 different holiday gatherings with his side, but so far not a single mention. Thank you MIL. All of my smart retorts got to stay unused.</p>

I’m sorry we are all here. I wanted to introduce myself and ask a question if that’s ok. TLDR at the end.

I got pregnant via IVF after and FET earlier this month. From the start something felt off. I got a positive FRER relatively late, and had the feeling something was wrong. Had good rising betas, however nothing seen on ultrasound in scans done at 4+5 and 5+2 following some on and off spotting. However, due to good betas, my RE wasn’t too concerned yet. I knew something was wrong but no one seemed to agree.
Flew across the country to visit family for the holidays. Cue increasing cramps on my right side at 5+4. Nothing really painful, but definitely getting worse. Wanted to avoid going to the ER so I went to a women’s urgent care center where they still couldn’t find anything via ultrasound despite climbing betas.
At this point I called my RE who suggested I go to the ER.
Went to the ER where a great US tech finally located the pregnancy in my right tube. My beta and this point was 5800 so they recommended surgery over methotrexate.
My right tube was removed and thankfully I was able to leave the hospital the same day.
I’m glad this is finally over and I have my answers. I’m mourning my loss but can’t wait to move forward as soon as possible.

My question is: for those of you who had tube removal following at ectopic, what were your pre-surgery beta levels and how long did it take for them to get back down to zero?
I took a pregnancy test one day after surgery and it was still a very very strong positive. My RE wants me at zero before we can talk next steps.

TLDR: had my tube removed due to an ectopic. Wondering how long it will take for my beta levels to go down to zero.

And now I’m back. And a mess, so.. apologies in advance because this is gonna be a long one.

The issues with my tubes were found to be caused by a ruptured appendix when I was a kid. Scar tissue and adhesions littered my pelvis. Multiple HSG’s and even a laparoscopy with a fertility specialist to try to clear out the adhesions to make the remaining tube functional were fruitless. After the lap, I was told that it is 100% blocked and there wasn’t a chance I could conceive naturally. The doctor left my tube in, saying that it wasn’t causing any harm. Okay, whatevs. That conversation made me think I would never have to come back here.

On 12/7 I felt weird. Period two days late (not super unusual) but I had a feeling and took a test. Bright ass instantaneous positive. The following Monday I went to my regular OBGYN due to the obviously high risk for ectopic. Lab work came back perfect, but nothing on the ultrasound. Doc wasn’t concerned, it was still early. Two weeks of labs every other day, all of which were textbook perfection. Another ultrasound at the end of the first week, still nothing. I’ll admit I did the thing I know I shouldn’t have. I got my hopes up. This shouldn’t have been happening, this was a miracle in and of itself. This could be THE miracle I’ve been waiting for. I ignored the science that I knew, the information I’ve had for years. And I got hopeful.

And then at the end of last week I had another ultrasound, and the pregnancy was found to be in the end of my tube, lodged right up against my ovary. Because my hsg was over 15000 at this point, my doctor wouldn’t give me methotrexate. So they sent me to the hospital across the street for surgery. I sat there for ten hours, they wouldn’t let me eat or drink or have ice chips. I was an add on to their schedule, so I kept getting pushed back due to emergencies. I was a sobbing, uncomfortable mess. I wanted to be home with my husband crying in bed and eating pizza. I was asymptomatic and pissed that they didn’t just put me on the schedule for the next day, which I requested and was told no. When they eventually told me I couldn’t get in until 10 am the following morning, I left. Went home for pizza and husband cuddles and already felt better. 

Surgery was okay. I wanted the tube out, because I never wanted to go through this ever again. Turns out my tube, ovaries, and part of my uterus have fused to my abdominal wall from all the scar tissue, so that’s fun. That also means the tube couldn’t be fully removed, but it was closed to avoid this from ever happening in the future. And now, I just wanna get drunk and use a tampon. I’m tired of pads. I’m tired of being sore. I hate being bloated and the pain from the CO2 is 10 times worse than the pain in my abdomen. Counting down the days until this year is over.

The following Monday I went to my regular OBGYN due to the obviously high risk for ectopic. Lab work came back perfect, but nothing on the ultrasound. Doc wasn’t concerned, it was still early. Two weeks of labs every other day, all of which were textbook perfection. Another ultrasound at the end of the first week, still nothing. I’ll admit I did the thing I know I shouldn’t have. I got my hopes up. This shouldn’t have been happening, this was a miracle in and of itself. This could be THE miracle I’ve been waiting for. I ignored the science that I knew, the information I’ve had for years. And I got hopeful.</p>

<p>And then at the end of last week I had another ultrasound, and the pregnancy was found to be in the end of my tube, lodged right up against my ovary. Because my hsg was over 15000 at this point, my doctor wouldn’t give me methotrexate. So they sent me to the hospital across the street for surgery. I sat there for ten hours, they wouldn’t let me eat or drink or have ice chips. I was an add on to their schedule, so I kept getting pushed back due to emergencies. I was a sobbing, uncomfortable mess. I wanted to be home with my husband crying in bed and eating pizza. I was asymptomatic and pissed that they didn’t just put me on the schedule for the next day, which I requested and was told no. When they eventually told me I couldn’t get in until 10 am the following morning, I left. Went home for pizza and husband cuddles and already felt better. </p>

<p>Surgery was okay. I wanted the tube out, because I never wanted to go through this ever again. Turns out my tube, ovaries, and part of my uterus have fused to my abdominal wall from all the scar tissue, so that’s fun. That also means the tube couldn’t be fully removed, but it was closed to avoid this from ever happening in the future. And now, I just wanna get drunk and use a tampon. I’m tired of pads. I’m tired of being sore. I hate being bloated and the pain from the CO2 is 10 times worse than the pain in my abdomen. Counting down the days until this year is over. </p>

<p>If you’ve managed to read this to completion, you’re a saint. If no one reads this, I’m just glad I have a place where I can get this all out. I appreciate all of you and this community more than I could say.</p>

Fast forward to September 2019. We found out we were pregnant again after a 2 year battle with infertility treatments. Today, at 15+3, I went to get a boutique ultrasound to get a nice picture for our announcement on Christmas. The lady said “I am not a medical professional so I can’t tell you what to do, but my advice is you head straight to the ER.” I knew then. We went to the ER and the lack of heartbeat was confirmed. Not three weeks ago, we got the results of our Panorama testing. It was a boy and he was genetically low risk for abnormalities. We had started celebrating. I started moving things around and preparing a space. We started trying our names. 

Now I’m in L&D with cytotec. They don’t really want you miscarrying at home at this stage, because of the bleeding. And since we will need fertility treatments again, I want an autopsy to rule out everything we can that could be prevented next time.

The core question I'm working on answering is ""How do I categorize this within my own mind?"" The first question my councilor and I are digging into is was this our first pregnancy or first child? (pregnancy I think is what I'm settling on) I know many of you would answer this question very differently for yourselves, but I'm trying to figure out the right answers for me. 

And boy oh boy do I have some feelings.

We named her Jane. I told everyone we named her Jane because I wanted people to know. But I don't know why I want you to know she had a name, and I like to see it written down, but I don't like it when you say it to me out loud. It makes me feel like you think you knew her. I didn't even know her. 

I don't consider myself a mother, though I've been through labor and half a pregnancy. 

Was this a stillbirth? A miscarriage? A termination? I've used all the words and none of them capture everything.

I had a choice and want you to acknowledge that. Don't say ""you didn't really have a choice"" because my health was in danger. I felt fine the whole time. It was *possible* we could have managed my heath for a few weeks. But also don't act like I should have done something else.

My sister in law is pregnant. My pregnancy was supposed to end up the first grandchild. But my sister in law's child will be the first grandchild now. That makes me sad, but I don't want you to ""honor"" my loss by offering to call Jane your first grandchild. 

I don't think of her as my child but I do think of her as my daughter. She never got to be a child. 

Was she a baby or a fetus?

She wasn't a person (yet). 

I like it when you acknowledge that it happened, but I don't want you to dwell on the loss part. I can talk about the medical stuff for hours and educate you on pre-e. I mean, I was in the hospital for 5 days. 

I'm angry that this happened and jealous of those around me, but I also want to be engaged and joyous. Don't talk about how incredibly excited you are, but don't avoid the subject entirely to spare my feelings. 

I am uncomfortable watching an episode of Gilmore Girls where Shari has Gigi but I specifically watched the episode of Downton Abbey where (spoiler alert) Sybil has eclampsia and dies. 

I am ready to be pregnant again but terrified of losing another in the same way. 

My grandmother's name was Jane. We didn't name her after her specifically, but liked that there was a family connection. Don't tell me that baby Jane is with Grandma Jane. 

My grandmother lived to be 93 and had a life and experience that deserves memory. There's nothing about my Jane *to* remember except for possibility.

I'm grieving the possibility of a person. Don't tell me you're thinking of Jane, tell me you're thinking of me.

Don't ignore it. But don't dwell on it. But let me talk about it and dwell on it if I want to.

I mean no one talks about this stuff right? Anyone I knew who got pregnant you assume their first success sticks. This was my first pregnancy ever. I’ve never had a scare in my 36 years on earth! 

Anyways, the doctor told us there was no fetus. We cried. A lot. Waited a week. Nothing happened on it’s own, so I got the pills and then bleed for about a month. It was devastating. At first I didn’t know how i’d get over it. Our due date was going to be January 4, 2020.  

It was a hard summer. I drank a lot to cope. My period returned to normal and we started in September trying again. Each month was a disappointment when nothing happened. 

Since nothing was happening I made a crazy decision. I switched jobs after 7 years with one company and moved to a completely different industry. 

Then as luck would have it....I find out I’m pregnant again a week into my new job.  Great! A bit awkward but I live in Canada so I’m lucky that I’ll be able to take maternity leave no problem. My due date is estimated for Aug 1, 2020.

Yesterday we went in for our first ultrasound. My doctor was a saint and managed to get us in before the holidays so that we could confirm things were progressing and tell our parents at Christmas. I knew there was still a risk in things not working out but my doctors said that after one MC my chances of another are decreased so I was hopeful. I bought ornaments off of Etsy that said “Grandma and Grandpa EST 2020” as gifts to surprise them. 

Ok, back to the ultrasound. I filled my bladder to the top! Like seriously, I thought I was going to pee my pants but I wanted to be in the best position as possible for them to see something. It happened again. I was supposed to be 8 weeks and they saw nothing. 

I’m just numb now. My family doctor has been an amazing support. I just got my blood taken this afternoon so she can double check that my levels are declining but I really feel like these last two month have been just....I dunno...fake. Like my body is lying to me. The nausea, sore breast, feeling in my stomach. It’s all fake. How can I trust my body again? Are two blighted ovums normal? Is this my body’s way of saying I’m just too old and should stop trying...and even if I’m successful would a full term pregnancy result in a child with abnormalities? 

I’m turning 37 in March and things are just looking hopeless.

<p>I guess what I&#39;m asking is, does anyone have any stories about dealing with pregnant family or close friends? How do you cope? Answers that will make me laugh are more than welcome!!</p>

And now I have this gut feeling maybe I'm not ovulating anymore - even though my positive OPKs are dye stealing. (I know OPKs are not proof ovulation will or have occurred.)  Maybe my body is STILL confused and thinks I am pregnant so it won't ovulate.  I am petrified that I will have to wait (I assume a year from my MMC) so next September just to find that out.
