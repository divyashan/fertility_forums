My baby's growth was four weeks behind and I was showing all the classic signs of severe, early-onset pre-eclampsia.  The doctors advised me to go to the hospital, where it was decided that the best course of action for my survival was to terminate the pregnancy.  I was checked into the hospital and underwent forty hours of labor, lost the baby of course.

This followed five pregnancies I've lost at different gestational ages (9wks twins; 12 wks single; 5 weeks unknown; 27 weeks twins; 8 weeks single).  

All of these losses were caused by a case of APS that is apparently too severe for the various treatments to make any difference (lovenox, aspirin, plaquenil . . . ).

Apparently being pregnant triggers my APS and the APS causes pre-eclampsia which makes pregnancy too dangerous to continue.  So I just cannot get past the 24-27 week point without nearly killing myself.  And all of this trouble has altered my heart in a negative way - I have an aortic stenosis now.

This was my final loss.  It is obvious to me that I will never have a successful pregnancy, I will never have a baby.  This reality is a lot to bear.  

My husband is crushed.  He desperately wants children and it's looking less and less possible, no matter how you slice it.

I was optimistic about this one. It was a surprise natural pregnancy. We saw a heartbeat two weeks ago. Baby measured 7 weeks. We saw a heartbeat with the last one too but I didn’t let it spoil my optimism. At least this time I didn’t have a subchorionic haematoma. That’s how I justified it.

 I had another scan today. A reassurance scan disguised as a “I don’t know when my period was and the midwife needs an estimate” scan. 

There was no heartbeat. Baby was also measuring slightly smaller than last time.

It’s gotten to the point where I’m kind of numb to it all but at the same time all I can think is, “why do they keep dying?”.

All I can do now is wait for the progesterone to wear off and see if that induces the bleeding. If it doesn’t I’ll be having medical intervention.

I never would have imagined how complex the emotions are. I expected that I would feel sad about the loss or hopeful about trying again... but cautious, cynical, jealous, bitter, uncertain... didn’t expect those facets of the experience. 

I found out at 9.5 weeks that the baby had stopped growing around 7.5. I was seeing an RE so had already seen the heartbeat at 7 weeks. So at least I could tell right away that something was wrong at the 9.5wk ultrasound... and my doctor had been telling me that 1 in 3 pregnancies end in miscarriage. So I was prepared, but still. 

Many of my friends had experienced miscarriages and I will be forever grateful to them for being open about it. I already felt like we were lucky to have not had one (this was our 1st pregnancy) and when we did, I took comfort in knowing how many others had gone through this. 

I know that it just didn’t work this time, and likely will in the future, but it’s hard to be reaching the holiday season when I thought I would be starting to show, telling friends, etc. We told both my parents and his, and it was the first grandchild for both, and they were so happy and loving and excited about it.

I also loved having that great secret, that awesome thing to think about during a tough afternoon or when hearing terrible news or just at random times throughout my day. I felt so lucky that being pregnant was actually pretty great for me, and I loved the way it changed my perspective of myself and of the world and of my husband. I miss that.

And now, to top it all off, of course my brother in law and sister in law just announced that they’re expecting. They were forthcoming with dates and it sounds like they got pregnant the weekend I was recovering from my D&C. I know it doesn’t have anything to do with our baby, and I am happy for them... but still wish I didn’t have to deal with their happiness, if that makes sense. Now I will have to hear about their pregnancy at the exact times I’m trying to forget my own. 

Getting close to ovulation, and we’re going to try again this cycle (IUI), but I had kind of mentally written this cycle off since it’s the first since my D&C... so it was going to be sort of low-stakes emotionally. Now it’s our only shot at being pregnant again by the time we go home for the holidays and hear all about the in-laws’ pregnancy, and our only shot till Jan/Feb. I am trying not to think like that, or rush into anything, but of course that’s easier said than done. 

So, I don’t know. I’ll be here. Lurking has been helpful, and I’m going to try to participate more, to help build up this community that has been so reassuring to me. Thanks y’all.

I know it doesn’t have anything to do with our baby, and I am happy for them... but still wish I didn’t have to deal with their happiness, if that makes sense. Now I will have to hear about their pregnancy at the exact times I’m trying to forget my own. </p>

<p>Getting close to ovulation, and we’re going to try again this cycle (IUI), but I had kind of mentally written this cycle off since it’s the first since my D&amp;C... so it was going to be sort of low-stakes emotionally. Now it’s our only shot at being pregnant again by the time we go home for the holidays and hear all about the in-laws’ pregnancy, and our only shot till Jan/Feb. I am trying not to think like that, or rush into anything, but of course that’s easier said than done. </p>

<p>So, I don’t know. I’ll be here. Lurking has been helpful, and I’m going to try to participate more, to help build up this community that has been so reassuring to me. Thanks y’all. </p>

I found out I had experienced a MMC on Monday at my second ultrasound when I was 9+2 based on O date (no spotting or other warning signs, apparently the baby stopped growing a week or so earlier). This was my first pregnancy, and timing of everything is just yucky since we went out of town to visit my in laws for thanksgiving, and the whole time I wondered if I would start bleeding. 

I had just announced to my parents on Nov 11th, but with caution because the baby had measured small and with a heart rate on the lower end at my first ultrasound on Nov 7th. I knew I would want support from them either way and now I’m really glad I let them know because they have been very emotionally supportive the last few days. We had not told my in-laws; we were going to announce by taking them out to a nice dinner while we visited during the thanksgiving weekend. We went ahead with the visit and the dinner but told them it was a 'just because' dinner. (Theres a lot of drama and pressure on that side and neither my husband or I really wanted to have conversations about my miscarriage with them this week.) And we were supposed to stay thru Sunday, but I knew I was probably going to have to take pills to pass the pregnancy and wanted some time at home to do that before heading back to work, so we left today which disappointed them but I would rather them be disappointed with us leaving early out of the blue rather than have a conversation with them about what we're going through. My husband is lovely and wonderful and been fully supportive but it’s still hard and I’m sure he’s too worried about me to process his own feelings about everything right now. 

Anyway, we got home, I took the pills, and am currently passing clots and waiting to see how long this will take. I also know I have not really processed everything emotionally, I am mostly numb with small moments of emotion and tears. 

I want to try again, but I’m scared at the same time. Have to start temping again. Have to decide how long to wait before we try again. Worried that if (or when) I conceive again I will just be a ball of stress nervous about another MMC. 

Anyway, sorry for the long rambling post. I’m grateful this community exists because it is a place where people understand the confusion and loss and hurt and sadness, although I wish no one ever went through this I know it is fairly common.

We lost our son at 4 days old in July due to complications during birth. Everything during the pregnancy was great until about 35 weeks when I developed gestational hypertension...still nothing to really worry about since the test for pre-eclampsia came back negative. However, my OB decided to induce at 37 weeks. I was in labor for 36 hours before my OB decided that he became ""stuck"" in my pelvis and had turned sideways. I was in the operating room for a C-section within the hour (again, still nothing to worry about except that I was terrified of the surgery). This is where things started to take a turn for the absolute worse. There were probably 20 doctors and nurses in the room, along with the NICU team.  I was so out of it I didn't really realize until after what was going on.  He was so wedged in my pelvis that my OB had to push his head out from my pelvis. He was taken directly to the NICU with my husband and I didn't get to see him again for almost 8 hours.  The next day was a whirlwind and I naively thought he would pull through. He had suffered a stroke during delivery and started having seizures every 5 minutes or so. On 2nd full day in the NICU we had the dreaded closed-door meeting with the team of physicians and were told that the damage was too extensive and he would not make it. They told us this was such a rare case and most of the time babies don't suffer that much damage (I want to ease others' fears, they told us this was ""one in a million"") We spent the next 2 days in the NICU where we held him, bathed him, changed him, and gave him oral care. He passed away when he was 4 days old in our arms. I think I was in a complete daze for awhile, not knowing what to do and say as I was also recovering from an unplanned c-section too. 

We are now approaching the 6 month mark, which is when we decided we'd start trying again. My thoughts are so consumed with my son and with the desire to have more children.  I'm filled with many emotions and fears but I also know we're meant to be parents.  I started tracking my cycle last month and feel back to my normal self, physically so now I'm just trying to stay positive as we TTC. Everyone (in-laws) have been asking a lot about when we're going to start TTC again, even asking specifically about when I'm ovulating.

Last thanksgiving, I was pregnant. I miscarried that baby at 7.5 weeks on Dec 3rd. 

It took 6 months to get pregnant again. 

We found out I was pregnant with twins around 6.5 weeks. Due to complications with placenta previa and oligohydramnios, I went into preterm labor at 19w5d and delivered (via c section) my beautiful son and daughter twins at 20 weeks exactly. They passed shortly after birth due to extreme prematurity. 

I'm struggling today. Being pregnant exactly a year ago makes this Thanksgiving hard. Going through a second holiday under very different circumstances is hard.  After a year, we have loved and lost three babies.  And I miss my twins the most. 

On the other side of this is forging ahead. This is the TTC after loss subreddit after all.  

I have always healed from other grief or sadness by looking at the next step.  I still want a baby in my arms. I still want to fill the cribs upstairs in the unfinished nursery.  But, because I had an emergency c section with a classical cut, I have to wait 6-12 months before attempting another pregnancy. I can deal with the fact that all subsequent pregnancies will end in c sections. Fine. 

But I cannot move on with my life and fill the empty, bereaved, childless hole in my heart until at least April. So I sit here in limbo. 

I started tracking my cycles again on a few apps so I could get an idea of my cycles for when that 6 months finally passed. And I'm ovulating this weekend over the holiday.  Every cycle since Aug 2016 has included inseminations when I've ovulated (we are a lesbian couple. Heavy logistics went into timing insemination with our known donor 1000 miles away).   Now I've grown attached to every egg that doesn't have a chance over the next 6 months. Every chance of potential that I won't have the opportunity to bring to life.  No inseminations this time. And it feels so strange. 

We aren't even having turkey for thanksgiving, which I'm glad for.  My lovely SIL decided to make lamb instead as a way to help us get through a very traditional family holiday.  Breaking tradition helps. 

So I'm sending love and strength out to all of you that wish you could have your babies at the table as well.   ❤️

In 2011 at the age of 30, I got pregnant with my first child in our 11th cycle trying. That pregnancy and delivery of our son was mostly normal. Nothing drastic to report. In January of 2017 we began trying again. In March we took a one month break and I was diagnosed with PCOS and put on Metformin. In April, on our third cycle, I got pregnant. We were overjoyed and ready to meet the baby who'd complete our family. Because I was 35 and OLD, we did the early Panorama test. With no genetic history of problems, we were basically just waiting to find out the baby's sex before we announced the pregnancy to the world. My morning sickness was just *delightful* but it reassured me that everything was going to be okay. I'd made it to the second trimester! Totally fine.

On July 6th, a day or two before I entered my 13th week, we received the results. We had a little baby girl, but she was at high risk for having Trisomy 18, which meant that - if positive - she was very unlikely to survive to her first birthday, let alone birth. We scheduled an amnio for late July, just after she turned 15 weeks. I remained in denial, but checked her heartbeat every evening and kept a spreadsheet of the numbers. On Friday, July 21st I had a strong desire to check her heartbeat in the morning and gave in. Still hanging in there.  That evening I couldn't find her. I texted my midwife and she met us at the ob/gyn clinic fifteen minutes later to do an ultrasound, which confirmed that our baby girl was gone, a day before 15 weeks. 

I don't have to fill in the rest - you all know what happened next.  The heartache, the grief, the depression, the appointments, the looks, the whispers, the self-loathing. I've already dealt with clinical depression my entire life, and the post-partum depression threw me into a despair I won't describe here. Luckily, I've been seeing a therapist for a long time.

We decided to try again, and because I'm just *ancient*, we had to begin to try quickly. None of us were emotionally ready, but I'm the youngest of all four parents, and I'm already considered ""up there"" in age. Our first cycle for Baby 3.0 was in early October the weekend of my 36th birthday. I actually had some unusual mild cramping, dark brown spotting, then all that went away and I had Extreme Fatigue (the likes of which I hadn't experienced since my first child, and I'd even put myself through grad school in the meantime) and my temps went up in a triphasic nature. Then Boom, period. I never even got a positive. But I'm positive something was there. My second cycle felt like every regular cycle I've had since I was thirteen. Nothing. I didn't even bother testing, and sure enough, I got my period.

Now we're revving up for the third cycle, but I don't see it ever happening for us. We're all just too old and maybe at this point we're just tempting Fate. Why are we even bothering? All my friends have kids in high school and are so thrilled to be done having babies. A high school friend and my younger cousin just had (adorable) babies with Down Syndrome. I'm at the age where this sort of thing becomes a pretty big concern. Trisomies are very real. Can we afford another Trisomy baby? Is this all just a lot of heartbreak for nothing in the end anyway? When do we call it a day and just be happy with the living baby we have?  We're SO insanely lucky to have him. Maybe we're just pushing our luck. I don't know how I'll survive if this happens again.

I actually had some unusual mild cramping, dark brown spotting, then all that went away and I had Extreme Fatigue (the likes of which I hadn&#39;t experienced since my first child, and I&#39;d even put myself through grad school in the meantime) and my temps went up in a triphasic nature. Then Boom, period. I never even got a positive. But I&#39;m positive something was there. My second cycle felt like every regular cycle I&#39;ve had since I was thirteen. Nothing. I didn&#39;t even bother testing, and sure enough, I got my period.</p>

<p>Now we&#39;re revving up for the third cycle, but I don&#39;t see it ever happening for us. We&#39;re all just too old and maybe at this point we&#39;re just tempting Fate. Why are we even bothering? All my friends have kids in high school and are so thrilled to be done having babies. A high school friend and my younger cousin just had (adorable) babies with Down Syndrome. I&#39;m at the age where this sort of thing becomes a pretty big concern. Trisomies are very real. Can we afford another Trisomy baby? Is this all just a lot of heartbreak for nothing in the end anyway? When do we call it a day and just be happy with the living baby we have?  We&#39;re SO insanely lucky to have him. Maybe we&#39;re just pushing our luck. I don&#39;t know how I&#39;ll survive if this happens again.</p>

<p><strong>TL;DR: I&#39;m old, lost my second baby to T18 at 15 weeks, we&#39;re trying again and I&#39;m wondering if it&#39;s even worth it or if we&#39;re just chasing a beautiful dream.</strong></p>

So, I had a stillbirth this September, on my due date, with no indication until the day of. 9 months of prenatal visits (including one the day before) were perfectly normal. At 2am on my due date my water broke. I called the midwife at our birth center and she said if I wasn't contracting to try to get some sleep and come in in the morning. When we went in they couldn't find a heartbeat. I was transferred to the hospital where they induced me. What no one seems to understand is that labor and delivery of my stillborn daughter was more traumatic (to me) than the loss itself. I assume that no one wants to think about that part of the process. Not to minimize our loss. It's just that no one acknowledges that labor and delivery was the worst day of my life.

I hated how many decisions had to be made that day, but we decided to do everything to find out why this happened. That meant blood samples from me, autopsy of baby, and chromosomal studies of baby. At ~4 weeks out they told us that they hadn't been able to do the chromosomal analysis because the sample was bad. That didn't bother me too much because everything else had come back normal. I made peace with the idea that this was a fluke. Pure bad luck. Something that would never happen again, especially since we have one healthy child. 

Well. Here we are 9 weeks out and the final autopsy report is finally in. The midwife called to tell us that the baby had a malformation in part of her brain. She doesn't know if that was the cause of the stillbirth. The medical director of the birth center (an OB) is going to talk to a pediatric neurologist and get back to us. So we wait. And everyone keeps saying how good it is that we might get an answer. No. I did not want this answer. I wanted the answer that I had before. The one that doesn't paralyze me in fear of another pregnancy. 

See, I'm seeing a new OB now. She's closer to where we live now and I don't associate her with our stillbirth. I went to her for my 6 week follow up appointment. We told her that there was no obvious reason for the stillbirth. She was awesome. She told us that I am physically ready to try to conceive again and that some families find it better to wait and others find healing in trying again right away, that that part was completely up to us. 

So, we've started trying and then we get this news. I still want to try, but I'm so scared of something bad happening again.

I'll start by introducing myself. I'm a 22 y/o female who resides in Ontario, Canada. My partner is a 30 y/o Male and we were expecting our first. A little boy. I had a  TFMR on Friday, Nov 17th at 20 weeks. Here is my story leading up to this..

At 15 weeks (Oct 13th) I went for a keepsake ultrasound to find out the gender of our baby. The ultrasound went well and seeing him move around was amazing. Not even 30 minutes after my ultrasound they called me to inform me that they saw something on my scan that looked concerning. They couldn't give me much information as they are not allowed to give medical advice as they're a keepsake ultrasound office, not a medical office and encouraged me to speak to my OB. Of course, I freaked out but called my OB and my OB said he would see me at my next appointment, which was a week away. 

On Oct 25th, I went to my OB appointment. Babies heart beat sounded good so I tried to convince myself that everything would be *just fine*. My OB looked at my scans and didn't seem too concerned, but said he would schedule me for a medical ultrasound anyways. 

On Oct 27th I had my medical ultrasound. At first the hospital had no clue why I was there, so I had to explain the situation. The woman doing my scan was nice, but I freaked out when she asked me if I had the down syndrome scan done at 12 weeks. I said no, because I had opted out of it. (I guess I was a little naive and thought that nothing could happen to me because I am young...and my mom had me at 31 and had no tests done and I turned out just fine so my baby should, too). I asked if I should be concerned and she tried to calm me down, but it didn't work. After that appointment I was a mess because something just didn't feel *right*. 

On Nov 1st my OB called me and asked me to come to his office. The whole ride there I was paranoid and panicked, but my SO tried to keep me calm and told me just to be optimistic. When we arrived at his office he told us he had our medical scans and it appears that the baby either has Gastroschisis or an Omphalocele and would most likely need surgery after birth. However, he was sending me to McMaster to get a detailed ultrasound done and a second opinion. I felt *crushed* after the appointment but tried to remain strong. I tried to avoid doing any research on the topic...but of course I did and found out that the worst case scenario would be that my baby had an Omphalocele with other anomalies and could possibly have Trisomy 18 or 13. After finding out that information something inside of me just told me to prepare for the worst case scenario but I was unsure why. 

On Nov 6th, we had our appointment at McMaster. The day started with an Ultrasound and then would follow up by speaking to a genetic counsellor and meeting with a doctor. When I went into my ultrasound appointment, they said I was there for my anatomy scan. I was slightly confused and told them I was referred because the baby either had Gastroschisis or an Omphalocele but she said her sheet said I was also there for an anatomy scan. My anatomy scan took over 2 hours...and at that point I knew something was not right. They kept leaving the room and coming back to get more images, saying that either the baby was no cooperating or that the doctor needed more images. At this point, I was getting annoyed. 

After the ultrasound I went to speak with the genetic counsellor and got in pretty quickly...but that's when my world came crashing down.  My worst case scenario came true. She informed us that yes, the baby had an Omphalocele. She then kept asking if I knew anything about Trisomy 18 or Triploidy. I knew very minimal, so she explained that they're chromosomal defects and she was **very concerned** for my baby. I was 18 + 4 when I went to that appointment, but the baby was the size of a 15 week old. In addition to the Omphalocele, he had a abdominal wall defect. She was very concerned that I would either miscarry, or he would pass after birth. Then the doctor came in with more bad news. His bones were measuring small. The one arm was missing a bone completely, the other had all the bones but they were very, very small. His kidneys were small, his bladder didn't appear to be working properly. His jaw was very small and he kept hyper extending his neck backward which is very unusual (and I noticed it on all the ultrasounds, including the 15 week keepsake one). He kept curving his hands inward and they also noticed a heart defect. They were also concerned about the blood flow from the placenta to the baby, as it wasn't passing as well as it should. 

At that moment, I knew exactly what was going to happen. I knew that I was going to terminate for medical reasons. I could not go through waiting for him to pass, or having him pass after birth. It would be too hard on me. The genetic counsellor kept pushing for me to do amnio, but I didn't want to if there was no way for me to save him. 

I cried, a lot. The genetic counsellor referred me to London Health Sciences to have the procedure done. I waited almost two weeks to see anyone, and in that time I was able to accept that I wasn't going to have my baby anymore...but it was at that time that he decided to kick and move a lot and I cried harder. How could something so wiggly and so active have so much going against him?

On Nov 16th I met with a social worker at London hospital and then I met with the doctor who would be doing my procedure. My doctor was amazing. I honestly could not have asked for a better person to be on my team. She helped calm my fears as much as she could and answered all of my questions. She also said she could send some of the tissues from the placenta and fetus away for testing if I wanted to, and we agreed to do it. 

The laminaria rod insertions were very uncomfortable, but what broke my heart was when I had to do the Digoxin to stop his heart. I felt like the worst human being ever for having to do that. I sobbed, and the nurse in the room held my hand. After that I had to have 8 laminaria rods inserted and pretty much went through labour pains the rest of the night. 

My procedure on the 17th went very smooth. I'm healing well physically with minor pain...but the emotional pain is *unreal*.

We got his foot prints done and I'm so glad we did...but I cannot stop crying. I feel like I've failed my baby...my family...my partner. He's been as helpful and comforting as he can, but I know he hates seeing me in pain. 

I didn't know it was going to be possible to hurt this much, and miss something I never got the chance to know. I didn't really consider myself a mom...but I guess I was...and it hurts so bad. 

We are going to try again in a couple of months, and honestly...that's the only thing that's keeping me going right now. I feel so alone, so empty...so *broken*. My eyelids are so incredibly swollen from crying, and I don't have any desire to go back to work. I'm supposed to go back on the 28th, but I don't think I'm going to be able to and I'm so afraid to tell them that I'm not ready. 

Does the pain last this badly forever? Will it ever feel better? I lost my Father when I was 11 years old, and my Grandfather a few years ago...but this pain is so different. 

I just need some kind words right now... sorry this was so long, thank you if you've read the whole way through.

My husband and I started trying over a year ago. The first six months were very laid back, very much a Not Trying/Not Preventing situation. Since then we've been making a concerted effort to predict my fertile window. A few months ago we started to get some investigations going with semen analysis for him and blood tests for me. We were referred to a fertility specialist.


We went from the angst of a fertility consult one week, to the joy of a prenatal consult the next, to the dismay of a loss the week after that.


Halloween was rough for me this year. After an awful morning learning that I was no longer pregnant, I managed to take an afternoon nap on the couch. I woke up to the sound of cheerful children on the doorstep, trick-or-treating. They heard me get up, and became excited that someone was home. I couldn't face them. I made my husband open the door and hand out candy. Later, I saw a woman cradling a baby to her chest. When I realised it was a real baby, and not a costume, I burst into tears.


I thought that I was unusually aware of parents with prams after we started trying to conceive. But now, after experiencing an early miscarriage, I feel *painfully* aware of every pregnant woman, stroller, and pram that I pass by. I'm sure it's just me, but it feels like there are more babies around than ever.

This friend has sent me several texts which have started to come off as more for her benefit than mine... self indulgent, like convincing herself she is doing the right thing by constantly messaging me. I don't know if she wants to just get the details or if she is just not understanding my request for boundaries, but I am at the point of being really angry about it. I want to be left alone. She knows I have had 4 losses before this one. I asked that no one send anything, and everyone including my family has respected my wishes.

I think I may be holding a grudge because she said in my presence before (a group text message) ""I can't believe I'm becoming a mom!"" when she brought a dog home. I had 4 miscarriages under my belt and that comment was beyond irritating. She also complains a lot about babies in public saying things like, ""Your baby is not that important"" which just made me want to put a wedge between us (that comment was super recent).

I sent her a thank you after her first condolence text but she's sent more texts, and my good friend has reached out to her to say please give me space. I found out yesterday she sent me a care package of products that I don't even use (she works for the brand). I am beyond annoyed that she is not respecting my boundaries to be left alone, and I feel like sending me a box of shit is a weird way of forcing my hand to speak to her. 

I realize that I am in the thick of the anger stage of grief, and this grief vulture is exacerbating that. But I don't know if I should say something, send a simple thank you, or ignore it. TBH I don't even want to open the box. I am just really annoyed that it feels like she's dumping her burden onto me. Her need to ""be there for me"" when I've asked for the opposite is a burden that should not be mine.

UPDATE: she texted me again tonight saying she is thinking of me and wants to keep letting me know that 🙄 and to let her know if she is being intrusive. I replied saying I’d like space and to be left alone. That’s the final warning, next time (if there is one) I am going to block.

He’s such a cool kid. I don’t feel like our family is complete. 

Yet in the last year it’s taken medicated cycles to get pregnant and I have now lost three in a row. None even making it to 6 weeks. (The last not even to 5, making this one more of a CP I guess?) 

Part of me wants to just give up and focus on my beautiful son. So many women don’t even get one child. And we are lucky. 

Part of me thinks I am not sure how much more I can take of expectation and disappointment. 

And yet, the disappointment and despair I will feel if we just say we are done is overwhelming. 

I know it’s our choice and ours alone and everyone has to make this choice for their own family. There is no right or wrong.

I just.... don’t want to always feel like our family is incomplete. I don’t want to always feel bitter when I hear of another friend, pregnant with their 4th child when they said “we weren’t even trying! Ha!” 

I’m not sure how to move past this. I want my son to know the love (and hate) of a sibling. When we die, I want him to have someone with shared experiences to hug him. 

I have always dreamed of adoption (not as a substitute but just that I loved the idea for forever) but..... $30,000.  Yeah..... I know US fostering is an option but that idea terrifies me too.

I’ve lurked this sub ever since my first lost last year, and am coming to you again after a second loss this past month. My first was lost at 9 weeks, and my October loss ended up being eptopic.

The doctor advised us to wait 4-6 months, before we try again due to the methotrexate. I am happy to finally, after exactly 30 days post op to have AF join me yesterday. 

My one question is what are some things you guys do to pass the time while you wait? I really don’t want to have TTC brain and have it consume every moment of everyday.

I don't ovulate really. I have PCOS, and since switching to keto I ovulated for the first time in well over a year (closer to 18 months) of trying. We were over the moon, and so happy that a diet change was all it took for us to finally have an opportunity to conceive. My husband unfortunately had some issues with the pressure of the situation, so we had to resort to a turkey-baster up my hoo-ha to get the days we needed, but we still did it!

About 10DPO I was testing like a madwoman and had some really random results. I'd get *really faint positives*, but not with all of the tests we had. Then all of a sudden at 12DPO it was like the gates of hell unleashed and I had the heaviest period I've ever had in my entire life (and I once had my period for literally 8 months straight). I was going through an Ultra sized tampon once an hour for about 48 hours straight. 

I just honestly thought I was pregnant. I kept telling my husband that I just knew I was pregnant and that it was definitely finally happening. Then it just wasn't. I felt insane because I kept telling myself that it was early and maybe the Shining elevator scene in my pants was just ""implantation bleeding."" 

I found out when I went to the bathroom right before I had to walk/run to my class (I work full-time and am in graduate school). I basically burst into tears and then immediately called my RE to get a hysteroscopy with HSG scheduled for my next cycle (which will be tomorrow). 

I was a fucking wreck and barely held it together sitting in class for two hours. I got out of class and texted my mom, ""Procedure scheduled for Tuesday. Unsuccessful cycle."" Then she called me and fucking *yelled* at me for being ""ungrateful for ovulating."" She said that I needed to be happy I ovulated and not crying that I wasn't pregnant. Then she mentioned my Brother and Sister-in-Law and how she went through something similar and had to wait a ""long time"" and thought they were infertile. I told her I remembered because I ALSO was trying to have a baby back then. Now they have a one year-old and I'm getting fucking catheterized while my husband jerks off in the next room. By the way - they only had to try for six months. 

I don't know. I just feel crazy for thinking it was a chemical pregnancy. Could that cause a heavier period? My period came on CD23, which is completely out of the ordinary. I just don't know if I belong here. I'm so heartbroken that my body failed me (yet again), and now I have to have an invasive and painful procedure tomorrow instead of being 3 weeks pregnant.

So, by the calendar I started bleeding at 6 weeks yesterday, after seeing nothing in the uterus or elsewhere on Friday. In May we had an empty sack loss at 6w4d. We've got a 3.5 year old, pregnancy was text book until high Bp at 38 weeks. My progesterone fell quickly this time from 14 to 8 in 2 days around week 5. All 3 conceptions were quick, the losses were both first try. So at least I know that he makes sperms that can swim, and I'm ovulating when I think I am at around 19 days.

We haven't done any testing because the obgyn assured us it was just a fluke last time. But I can't try again until I know something. I don't know what testing to ask for. I just want to rule somethings out, or ideally find a cause so I know our chances. Will an obgyn do it, or do I have to see a reproductive endocrinologist? I see people saying that they had a hard time getting testing until 3 losses, which is heartbreaking and not something I feel like I can do.

I feel like there are so many women here who have been through such longer and more painful struggles, which makes me feel guilty for feeling so lost. I am doing emotionally better than last time because I knew that there was a good chance of a repeat and decided not to have hope.

Wish me well, extend the invitation and leave me alone! If one more person tells me what I need to do I&#39;m going nuclear on them. I&#39;ve taken to making people feel like crap for assuming I&#39;d be so jolly and happy. Stop assuming and just leave me alone. </p>

I have a young son, who was conceived after what felt like forever but was only about 10 months of trying.

Anyway! That’s all great and I love that little dude more than anything.
We found out we were pregnant on Mother’s Day this year. A pretty lovely and surprising...surprise. On our 9 week ultrasound we found out it had been a blighted ovum. No fetal pole. They opted for me to pass it naturally which I was fine with, but that didn’t occur for another 5 weeks. It was BRTUAL.

(Question for mods: Is it possible we can get a stickied post about our D&C, medically managed, and natural MCs experiences? It'd be a huge help to those who want to know what to expect) To any new user: don't EVER allow your doctor to push a D&C back weeks, it's not right nor is it safe. But here's my story. 

You're told the anticipation is worse than the proceedure. And that is true. (You guys were right!!! Again lol) By the time the nurse came to do my IV I was in tears. When the anesthesiologist came back each time to talk I was in tears again. I was terrified something horrible would happen, no matter the reassurance my anxiety PEAKED. The guy joked that my response is normal, he has that effect on all women. Once he realized I was still pretty upset, he gave me trodol. Drug wise, that did not really relax me. I just felt sedated. Too sedated to cry so that's a win. Told my mom I'll be done soon and wheeled into the OR. I was instructed to get into the surgery bed, which was more like a table. The best way to describe next was literally like a pit crew. Everyone had a different job and they were all really nice to me and each other. They all seemed like they were great friends. 

I was then strapped down and told to lay flat. One nurse put a mask over my face and told me to inhale deeply, then cough. At the same time, another nurse put something else in my IV, and this BURNED. It burned and hurt. Not severe pain, but enough to make me cry out. I started to freak out a little but was assured it was normal and it suddenly went dark. I woke up with a sore throat, swollen lip, and pain on a scale of 4, maybe 4.5. They gave me benadryl in case and mentioned I may have bitten my lip instead of it being allergies. Quick mirror check informed me that yes, I indeed chomped on my lip. Was given fentanyl for pain. I was pretty out of it, but grabbed onto the information that they got the little piece out, most was gone already due to my bleeding the last couple of days. I scarfed graham crackers and cranberry juice to make myself pee so I left pretty quickly,  via wheelchair as my legs didn't work 😂 Follow up is in 2 weeks. Usual spiel of no sex, tampons, or douches. Got some chick-fil-a on the way home, grabbed a nap, and here I am. My throat is still sore (normal) and I am feeling weak in the knees, but bleeding is light and so is the pain. You guys have all my love and gratitude. I read every pm and comment all the way up to being wheeled into surgery. God bless you guys. Seriously ❤

**To those past, present, and future who will read this:** I leave this last part here because like me, and those here, when you learn you have to get a D&C, you want to know what to expect, the stories of those who went through it, and to know you're not alone. Take it from this girl who was terrified...and take it from the lovely ladies who shared here as well. You'll be okay. I'm so sorry for loss, I'm truly so sorry. Take it one step at a time, one day at a time. Grieve on your schedule alone, and no one else's. This wound won't ever heal, but in time it does get a little easier <3 Be kind and gentle with yourself, and we're ALL here for you.

I&#39;m okay! I&#39;m...incredibly nauseated and gassy 🤢 and crampy. (Question for mods: Is it possible we can get a stickied post about our D&amp;C, medically managed, and natural MCs experiences? It&#39;d be a huge help to those who want to know what to expect) To any new user: don&#39;t EVER allow your doctor to push a D&amp;C back weeks, it&#39;s not right nor is it safe. But here&#39;s my story. </p>

<p>You&#39;re told the anticipation is worse than the proceedure. And that is true. (You guys were right!!! Again lol) By the time the nurse came to do my IV I was in tears. When the anesthesiologist came back each time to talk I was in tears again. I was terrified something horrible would happen, no matter the reassurance my anxiety PEAKED. The guy joked that my response is normal, he has that effect on all women. Once he realized I was still pretty upset, he gave me trodol. Drug wise, that did not really relax me. I just felt sedated. Too sedated to cry so that&#39;s a win. Told my mom I&#39;ll be done soon and wheeled into the OR. I was instructed to get into the surgery bed, which was more like a table. The best way to describe next was literally like a pit crew. Everyone had a different job and they were all really nice to me and each other. They all seemed like they were great friends. </p>

Brief back story: 3 miscarriages in 2016 lead to all the testing under the care of an amazing RE who diagnosed me with a uterine septum, and no other issues were detected in mine or my husband's test results. Scheduled septum resection surgery. Got pregnant by accident before surgery (just my motherfucking luck), miscarried again as expected because of the septum. Septum was finally removed in May. Conceived again in September, everything going perfect during weekly ultrasounds from 6-9 weeks. We'd never made it that far so we were finally full of hope.

NIPT showed normal results. 12 week NT scan today. No heartbeat. Baby girl measured 9 weeks. We are confused and heartbroken. 

My RE called me right away when she heard the news and she promised to do extended research and talk to her network of experts to find out what, if anything, she can try next for us. I appreciate having her on our team. I feel like I've been tested for everything though, I can't imagine what is left. I am hypothyroid but it is well managed and has been for 15 years.

All I heard was success story after success story from women who had their septum removed after multiple losses and went on to have healthy babies without any issues.

I wanted you to live longer, so very much longer. You were born from a sperm and an egg that met through your father's and my love for each other. To our sorrow, you did not have the ability to grow much beyond burrowing into my womb, triggering what would have been your first home to begin to form. You died shortly after that, right as we realized that we had made you, and were thrilling at the thought of you growing bigger and bigger until we could finally meet you.

When we thought we would have our first chance to see you, you were already gone. We waited patiently, hoping you just needed a little more time to grow, but you had long dissolved into your surroundings. We grieve your passing terribly, and we wish with all our hearts that you had been able to keep growing. But we also love you just as you were, and we thank you for your presence in our lives. You gave us a lot of joy.

Tomorrow I will have the remnants of what would have been your first home removed from my body, which has already begun to collapse in your absence. It will hurt, but I will heal, and space will be made in my womb for a new beginning. We hope that one day a sibling of yours will burrow into my womb, trigger a new home, and grow bigger and bigger until we finally meet them, just as we dreamed of meeting you. In a way, we will finally meet you then too. You will be part of them, because you are part of your father and me, as they will be, and because you inhabited the space that forms their first home... but most of all, because you came from our love and our dreams, as they will, and where I now realize you have returned.
