I'm tired of waiting and I'm not okay with waiting any longer. I've communicated this to him and he just brushes it off saying the virus isn't under control yet (it has been in my county in my opinion for about a month as we've only been reporting 20-30 some new cases per day as opposed to the 90+ we saw 6 weeks ago.) 

Now, I'm on a special diet to control my seizures and it'd been altered for my pregnancy and my neurologist kept me on it with the idea that we'd start trying again fairly quickly. She warned if my body got back to 100% normal (hormone wise) that it might not be effective anymore. Well, I've been feeling weird since my period ended on Sunday and my neurologist is now thinking we might need to switch back to my diet before we got pregnant. I communicated this to my husband and he just said ""No. You're not going back to that diet.""

I've also tried to explain to him the whole time aspect. I'm 33 going on 34 in November. We don't have the luxury of time anymore! If we wait until the pandemic is done with, we may never have kids just based on the decline of fertility and possible safety! My husband seems to think women are fertile until menopause!

Since then my cycles have returned and have been pretty regular with 30-32 day cycles. Based on OPKs and CM, I ovulate around CD 17-19 however I’ve noticed in the last three of my four cycles, I get extremely painful cramping around the time of ovulation. The cramps are so painful, it feels like my uterus is flexing and I have the urge to sit on the toilet and bear down just for some relief.

I feel like so much has happened and that I have really struggled to heal, so I thought it may be helpful to share my experiences in case anyone else is going through the same things, and also for myself as a form of catharsis. TTC after loss is a very difficult journey and I just want to share some things I have learned. 

Discussing infertility and loss with others, even close family members, can be so challenging and difficult. I think that many people who have not experienced loss cannot comprehend what it feels like, or even if they have, but are far removed from it, they don't dare try to emphasize because it is so painful. It becomes this burden that you feel like you and your partner are doomed to bear, and it can easily become overwhelming. Do not try to carry this burden alone, and unless you have someone you can lean on, you should seek either professional help if you can afford it or some other way to release your emotions and clear your head. I have been doing some online counseling that is affordable for me, and I have found it somewhat helpful. I have also found that occasionally joining in on the discussions here or posting to be helpful. This is the most kind and supportive community you can ask for. 

Do not judge yourself for the emotions you are having and accept and support yourself through this experience. Grief is not straightforward and logical. For me it has been a roller coaster, with waves of emotion crashing into me at often the most inopportune times. Give yourself all the time and space you need. Consider yourself first when deciding if you will do things that you think may be harmful. For example, my SIL is a having a gender reveal party that I am going to skip out on. My family may not understand, but I know exactly how that event makes me feel (they are aware of my loss) and I am choosing not to attend. I also did not attend one of my favorite co-workers baby shower this past week (we had due dates 5 days apart), and I know she understands. 

Give yourself time to physically recover. I am so inpatient, and I wanted to TTC right away. As soon as my HCG test was negative it was a go. But my body has not been ready. My first period was not for 8 weeks after my D&C. Then my next cycle seemed normal at 29 days, however I did not have any signs of ovulation. The following two cycles were almost a week longer and again no ovulation. I was beginning to get desperate, and when I spoke to my GP about these concerns she simply suggested referring my to a ART clinic with a >6 month wait list. Like I said, I am impatient! It is only now that I have had a cycle where I ovulated and it lasted 31 days, and I see a glimmer of hope. 

Lastly, remember that to put it bluntly, these are crazy times, and no matter who you are, you are likely experiencing higher than normal stress. I actually hate when people mention stress as a cause of infertility. I actually like to think that it is more your ability to take care of yourself in stressful situations. You are the only one who can take care of yourself and you have to own that. Do the things that make you feel truly good, I found this has been how I have started to heal.

I am dealing with a dilemma and I could really use some advice from women who might have had similar experiences. I'll try to keep it short!
So yesterday I talked to my yoga teacher who I did a yoga teacher training with. She is amazing, and has an amazing (different) and more spiritual way of looking at things. As a yoga teacher, I have been going through a couple of months of not practicing. I have got been able to get on my mat at all. Which is weird because I have been practising for 15 years now.
When we talked about all the things that have happened in the past 14 months, she pointed out something interesting. 

First, last year in June, we found out we were pregnant in the same month we quit birth control. We were not actively trying. I was super overwhelmed and happy, but crazy overwhelmed! I was so excited and happy that it came as a surprise because after seeing my sister going through fertility problems, I always told myself to start a bit earlier to avoind ending up in the same situation (ironic, cause that is exactly what happened in the end). So the BFP was def a happy moment. Then after 10 weeks we had an ultrasound planned and we could not wait to hear the heartbeat for the first time. At the gyno office, we saw the little embryo, but my gyno could not find a heartbeat. She tried different things to find a sign of life...but after a while she said something was wrong and that it was a missed miscarriage. That was not just overwhelming, but that moment, lying there, was a shock for my body and my mind. The day after I had a D&C, which was also the first surgery since i-dont-know-how-long-ago. Very bad and anxious experience, got really sick of the anesthesia on top and had a very rough recover from all of it. 

Since September, after my first period, we tried.. and tried. I started tracking, and we were having dissapointment after dissapointment. But we kept trying and being hopeful. My husband has been amazing during all of this. 

3 months ago (after being unsuccessful since september), on top of everything that happened in my reproductive area (taking progesterone, lots of check ups at the gyno, scans, biopsy..) they found pre stadium cancerous cells in my cervix (HPV flared up after the miscarriage, apparently that happens a lot) so I had to go through another surgery in June to have a little part removed. Another very overwhelming experience. 

Right now we started with a fertility clinic and I am supposed to have a HSG next week (had a BFN this morning so once AF has arrived, I need to make that appointment). I still feel hopeful and I guess I want to do it. Whatever it takes, we'll do it. 

However, after a long and very deep conversation with my teacher yesterday, she pointed out that there is definitely some sort of trauma built up. Because the same area has been affected, time after time, after time, after time. And it builds up. Which I kinda feel, because I no longer enjoy my yoga practice anymore and I do have a crazy feeling of ""feeling stuck"". She gave me a name of an amazing trauma specialist (psychology degree and specialised in trauma) and she is apparently very efficient. After 1 or 2 sessions she knows already how to get through some of the trauma and she works with family constellations. I did some research on her and I am pretty sure she could do positive things for me. 

I do feel like, maybe?, taking a break to see if that is the reason why it's not happening? Maybe there is a crazy amount of tension built up in my reproductive area? 

At the same time I feel motivated to ttc and see what the fertility clinic can do for us. But i am also drawn to the idea of healing and working through everything that has happened already... 

TTC has made me so insecure and sometimes I just don't know anymore what to do. 

Girls. I would love to hear your opinion on this ♡ thanks already for reading if you made it till here ♡

OK so last Sunday I started to lose my second pregnancy at 5+5. My previous one had made it to 5+2, and was very recent.

I am high risk so had already been registered with the midwife, and with the first loss, I got the letter containing the documents for my 12 week scan and blood test appointment on the Friday following losing it. They had posted it the day I started to lose it, not their fault but this is important later. 

Then we come to the second pregnancy, also registered early, and started losing at similar timing but obviously expected the letter. Letter arrives last Friday, decided to leave it till today to call.
I've had a rough week, I've been dealing with it at home with painkillers etc.  
I do the necessary and call, nurse is lovely and offers to sort it all and wishes me well. 

This evening I tell hubby I've cancelled them on the way to the shops(its a nice evening, chilled walk etc), and he's PISSED. Whoaaaa. What the hell. Apparently he thought I was going to keep the appointment so they could have a look and see what was wrong, why the babies didn't stick. So I say ermmm the scans are for pregnant women, I'm not pregnant. He says Lie, I want to find out. 

Cue the steaming argument held in whispers as we pass normal people. 
He does not get that you can't just turn up to a BABY scan and 'get them to have a quick look' when you HAVE NO BABY INSIDE YOU just to see whats wrong with you. 
He tried glossing over it when we got home, am like errrr no  how about you apologise for being an ass, but apparently its my fault for not being willing to try just turning up and seeing what they will do  so we are back to not talking.

Anything appreciated. I know I'm still mad so I'm going to have to just take it. 

Edit- and now he's convinced that because the little stick tests still have a pink line -HCG still not gone, duh, only a week, that maybe I'm still pregnant- literally contradicting himself.

I have had symptoms (nausea, hyper sensitive sense of smell, smell induced nausea, fatigue, food cravings, food aversion, increased appetite) for about a week. My period is 1-3 days late. I had my LH peak on 7/31 and my period comes pretty consistently 13 days after the peak. Today would be 15 days later. But all the tests have been negative. This is my first cycle using Femara (5 mg), and the progesterone blood test confirmed ovulation. 

I need this, I really really do. I need something good. I'm so scared to be excited.

I was diagnosed with PCOS when I was 16, and I've always been given evasive non-answers by doctors if I could have children. (""You have plenty of time before you get there."") It took me nearly 3 years to get pregnant with my daughter. (Found out at 6.5 weeks with her.) I honestly, truly believed I couldn't get pregnant at that point. That being pregnant was a fluke or a miracle. Only to lose her at 22 weeks to an infection due to ruptured waters from a weak cervix (dilated painlessly and randomly to 6 cm four days after my anatomy scan when I was told every thing was perfect.) I was in the hospital for two weeks fighting to keep her alive while all of the midwives watched and waited for her to die. They said things like, ""Next time, we can do a cerclage. Next pregnancy, but not with us. There's an office across the street."" ""I don't want to give you hope."" ""I don't see this ending positively."" ""Calm down, stop crying."" ""If you can make it 8-9 days, we have options. But that's unlikely."" (We made it past 8-9 days and I asked what the options were and was told, ""watchful waiting."")

Needless to say it was extremely traumatic. 

I'm still not over the nurse telling me the day after I delivered my stillborn miracle, ""there's no reason you couldn't have another baby.""
Of course, there's no reason. Not that I have PCOS, or that it took 3 years to get pregnant, or that my insurance doesn't cover fertility treatments or tests (they cover consultations. I think we're technically treating PCOS so they've covered everything so far. And for some reason they covered the Femara generic. I don't ask questions) or that I have an insufficient cervix so I have to have surgery to stay pregnant and hope I don't get another infection. Or most importantly, I wanted this baby. She was perfect and mine and I just wanted to be her mama. I know I'm probably experiencing some PTSD from it. I know my boyfriend does. He gets flashbacks. 

I don't trust doctors. It's so hard for me. I feel like no one tried to save my baby.  So scared she'll be my only child. I feel like as soon as something went wrong, the midwives were ready to dump me on someone else. They just needed my baby to die so they could wash their hands of me. 

I'm so frustrated with my new doctor's office. My preconception visit, I explained how I had charted and tested and I seemed to ovulate very late in my cycle. None of that mattered. She declared I wasn't ovulating. We would do a day 21 progesterone test. If I'm not ovulating, induce a period with progesterone, try Femara. Another blood test to confirm it worked. Then we would do that for 3-4 cycles and if I don't get pregnant then shipped off to a specialist. 

So my second visit with my new doctor's office and they're already talking about sending me somewhere else. 

I did my blood test, waited a week. They hadn't contacted me. So I called them, they gave a message to the nurse. The nurse called me back saying I wasn't ovulating and that we were going to do Clomid, and no progesterone to induce a period. No. No. No. That's NOT what we talked about. I tell them no, that's not what we talked about. Not what's in my notes. The nurse looks up my notes. Confirms what I said. The doctor is out of the office until Monday, but they'll send her a message and get back to me. Luckily, she responded quickly and treatment was corrected to the original plan. A week to two weeks later, they called me to give me my results I already had and tell me we would use Clomid. 

Okay, fine. Mixups happen. People get busy. Things happen. 

I just had my progesterone blood test on the 5th. My doctor's office doesn't have in house blood tests. My account through LabCorp shows that they sent the results to my doctor on the 6th. The results post to my account through LabCorp on the 10th. I'm confident through my interpretation that the test confirms I ovulated this cycle. So I wait to see when they'll contact me. My period was due between the 13th and 15th. I contacted them on the 14th. Left a message for the nurse. The nurse called me back an hour later. Gave me my results, said we'd continue Femara for 3 cycles, sent refills to the pharmacy. Call us when you get a positive test. 

How is it that if all that information was readily available, that they didn't contact me? A SECOND TIME. Especially with a time sensitive matter. The test was done on day 21 and I need to start Femara on day 3. How am I supposed to trust that between NINE doctors that my ultra high risk pregnancy will be adequately cared for? And that concerns won't fall through the cracks?

Yes, every obgyn in my area makes you see all doctors in an office for prenatal care, and all of them have 7-9 doctors. I will never have the same doctor 2 times in a row unless there are scheduling conflicts. Whoever is on call when I go into labor is who delivers my baby. 

I want to deliver my baby at the hospital I delivered my daughter (nurses were amazing), but I hate their MFM. An MFM is my only option to have one or maybe two doctors responsible for my care. There's another MFM but I would have to deliver at different hospital.

I had a MMC which was diagnosed on New Year’s Eve when I went for my first scan at 13 weeks. It took 2 months for everything to clear, 3 doses of miso, an infection and eventually d&c. Husband and I decided to have a short break before trying again which we’ve been doing for about 3 months now. It took us a year to get pregnant the first time around and I have superbly irregular cycles it seems, ranging from 25 to 35 days so I’m not exactly hopeful at the moment but also don’t feel like I can handle going through the nhs to get a fertility referral right now. 

Anyway, my rubbish experience aside, my best friend told me her and her partner were trying again. Great for them. A month later and bam, they’re pregnant, just like that. She’s now taken to texting me daily updates on her pregnancy symptoms and saying to me how much she is struggling this time around, how hard she is finding it and asking advice on how to cope with morning sickness as I really struggled when I was pregnant. I’ve told her I’m finding it difficult to handle and she’ll stop for a day or two before starting again. 

She’s also using my miscarriage as an excuse with her midwife to request an early scan for reassurance (UK based so first scan is usually 12 weeks here). I don’t have an issue with her wanting some reassurance but I am finding it so frustrating she’s using me as the reason why, probably being super irrational but there we go! On top of that, after we had a long conversation about how insensitive I was finding her behaviour, she then asked me 2x days later if I would go to her first scan because her partner can’t! That was a rather huge slap in the face! I’m trying so so hard to be happy for her, I really am. But all I can think about is how unfair life really is and how I would give literally anything to be in her position and struggling with a bit of nausea and tiredness! I want to support her as she is my best friend but at the same time, I have a limit. I’m usually an incredibly patient, easy going person but this is just really starting to get to me and I don’t know what to do.

Basically I am driving myself C R A Z Y  because I swear to God i ""feel"" pregnant.

I have all the feelings I had when I first got pregnant (and then sadly miscarried) a few months ago.

My fiance keeps telling me to chill, he thinks I am ""making this up"" or that I am just PMSing and he doesn't want me to get my hopes up....
I have NEEEEEVER before experienced PMS in this way.

 He might be right, he might he wrong... I just dont understand the need to bring me down ....

Like why cant you just be excited for us? I get it. It broke our hearts to loose our previous baby, I get it more than anyone...

 I experienced all the pain and grieve, and I was crying my eyes out until early this week. Because I feel nauseous,  I am tired AF, also I am gassy, and lots of other little things....

Like... I am trying to explain to him that what I am feeling is not normal, I know my body (at least i hope i do ) and he just doesn't ""believe "" me.... it hurts my feelings. It hurts because i am an over thinker, and half of me thinks he is right... and that is my mind playing games....

I am also scared shitless to be pregnant, because I am scared I will miscarry again and I honestly dont know I am strong enough to go through that again....

Also, should i test? I'm only 8dpo and i know it is way too early.... my period is not due for almost a week!!!!

But I am tired of being sad... I just want to be happy... I need this to be happy.... there is no other thing I want in the world than to be pregnant, and stay pregnant...

I am so scared, but also really excited and dont k ow what to do and how to deal with all my current feelings and aggghhh help!!! Please I just need someone to like... say literally anything, we told all our friends we are not trying anymore cause i cannot deal with the pressure...

A year ago I had a miscarriage 7 weeks along. The first 4 months after the first loss I started temping and charting but seemed to get frustrated with the fact that I wasnt getting pregnant. So I decided to quit and run with it. We began having sex whenever we felt like it and just tried to relax on having a baby. We conceived almost exactly a year later and still lost the battle. I didnt know much about chemical pregnancies up until it happened to me. I've done some research on what it is and what causes it. I've also looked into recurrent miscarriages and have found that baby tylenol can help with recurrent miscarriages and conception.
      After the chemical pregnancy I talked with my doctor and had some blood work done to check on hcg levels and my thyroid, where my dad's side of the family has thyroid issues. My doctor told me my thyroid levels are normal and my hcg was negative already. No word on looking further into the situation as this is the 2nd loss in a year. Given the fact that I had gone to get bloodwork 3 days after the bleeding began, is it possible to be negative already? I had a faint positive less than a week before. My thoughts are very scattered but I feel as though progesterone or any hormone levels are at play here. My cycles are between 32 to 35 days since the first loss and my doctor considers that irregular. In my mind irregular is more than a week apart cycles. Maybe I am misinformed but my cycles seem somewhat regular. Before I had even had a positive test to begin with I was 28 to 30 day cycles. Just looking for some advise or insight to why this keeps happening. It seems a little ridiculous to let a patient have a 3rd miscarriage before taking the situation seriously and referring said patient to a fertility specialist.

Q: How do you all deal with families who “don’t get it”? My little sister is 4 months pregnant, I’ve been TTC for 1.5 years and have unexplained infertility. My only “pregnancy” was my first IUI and it ended in an ectopic. 

I thought I’ve been handling well. I still see my sister and family often (every weekend), ask about the pregnancy when I am able to handle. I’m not in denial. I also am seeing A psychologist once a week who specializes in infertility.

My parents sat me and my husband down this weekend (while my sister, her husband, my brother and his new gf, and my two stepsons were upstairs). I was basically told I needed to get better. My dad thinks I should be more bubbly with my sister and ask her about ultrasounds and morning sickness. My mom thinks I’m being unreasonably sad because this is the natural order of things, people get married and start a family. DH and I waited almost 4 years to start TTC because he got laid off and I wanted to be fiscally responsible. He found a new job and we started TTC right away (1.5 years ago)

I was devastated to say the least. I (while sobbing) explained that I’m doing the best I can. I’m here every weekend, I’m asking questions or making comments when I can, I’m seeing a psychologist. I’m not in denial just in unimaginable pain. I was so hurt and angry because I think I’ve been doing so well and apparently that’s not good enough.  We basically ended the convo with my sobbing about how they don’t understand the pain I’m in and I’m doing my best and they need to back the F off, while my husband consoles me and stood up to them saying this is the worst timing. I had just my final IUI 6 days before. 

I texted them both this Article that night:

https://themighty.com/2016/11/letter-to-the-mother-of-a-woman-dealing-with-infertility/

My mom came down the next morning and was crying and so apologetic, she didn’t know the level of hurt I was in and did more reading and sees how I’m doing the best I can.

My dad texted me and said “Chelsea thank you so much for sending the article about your pain. I was stupid For not recognizing the depth of your hurt. I knew you were hurting but was clearly insensitive. I  am sorry for not being more aware. Know that I love you and I’m here for you any time.

First, I love this group. Thanks for all your support over the years in my TTC journey. 

Background: I had two miscarriages and am currently trying for my third baby. I always had a short LP, and it was discovered during my pregnancy with my son that I had thyroid antibodies. Took synthroid, aspirin, and progesterone. Was successful.

Fast forward three years later and I have had spotting from 4dpo until I get my period at CD 27/28 since I weaned in January (got my period back in November...it was normal until I weaned).  Ovukate between 14-16dpo. I wanted to be patient, give it time...after all, my body knows what to do right?! Wrong. Each month I have more and more spotting and longer periods (on day 7 and going strong as we speak). This cycle I only had 9 days of no period or spotting. I am over this. 
My GP tested my thyroid in may and said it was ""fine"" so he referred me to my OB. 

I have my appointment with my ob over the phone tomorrow (thanks covid). At this point I am terrified to get pregnant and almost want to stop trying because I am so scared of miscarrying again. I am hoping it is my thyroid and I can just take synthroid again to help things along...

So my question to you all is...
1) if my thyroid is messed up and I need synthroid should I wait until I can fix it before resume trying? 
2) should I ask for progesterone to take during my LP to help the spotting/improve my chances of keeping it if I am successful
3) any other questions I should ask/am I missing anything

I was told I could start trying again as soon as I confirmed this, though I may wait until I get my first period. I was also told to contact the hospital again if it’s still showing as positive.</p>

<p>I took a test on Sunday and it was a squinter. Today, Tuesday, I did the same thing, and again a squinter. I decided to run out and get a digital test and that came back as not pregnant. </p>

<p>Does anyone have thoughts about this or experience? It would be much appreciated. I don’t want to contact the hospital if it’s nothing.</p>

I have to wait till tomorrow to get a hold of my OB to figure out what my next step is. This is my first baby in 10 years so I thought my worries we’re silly now I’m like I must have known. I felt like the hospital sucked at delivering the news to me basically gave me a packet and let me go. I know I need to pass the baby and go from there but like when will this happen I can’t help but feel uncomfortable knowing it’s not alive anymore.</p>

209,2048,confidence,<praw.reddit.Reddit object at 0x7f12a630cd90>,,ttcafterloss,"Hello brave ladies - hoping you can share your experiences/thoughts on this topic.  Sorry in advance for the long post.

My first two periods after my loss in April seemed normal.  However, last cycle (3rd) my period was quite light - I bled for about four-five days in total, but amounts were light-medium during that time, and I never had a heavy bleed which is what is normal for me.  I wrote this off to that cycle being very stressful.  I felt much calmer during the 4th cycle, and thought that if I did have a period, I'd be sure to return to my 'normal' as per the first two.

My period started properly yesterday (today is CD2 of cycle 5) and although I had a really good heavy bleed at first (one pad very full), today I've woken up to practically nothing on my pad.  This is the same thing that happened during the 3rd cycle in that I would not bleed overnight and then during the day, I'd just not seem to pass that much.  This is not how things used to be pre-loss, or in the first two cycles in that my heaviest bleeds would be overnight (I'd wake up and my pad would be soaked).  I'm worried this cycle will turn out the same.

So, first question: **Could this just be the new normal, or is it possible for problems to emerge months afterwards?**  I had surgery for my loss which was my first pregnancy, but my understanding was that any scarring/blocking is normally apparent quite early on.  There wouldn't appear to be any (significant) blockage to my cervix in that blood is able to escape, but could I have adhesions that are reducing the quality of my lining?  I had an u/s about three weeks' after my surgery, and all appeared to be good with a trilaminar stripe.  I'm also aware that the amount of bleeding doesn't necessary have any connection to lining quality, so it could just be the way things are now.  My cycles are still regular and I appear by all intents and purposes to be ovulating.

Second question: We are going to keep trying for two more months (six cycles), and then have a break for two months, so I figured that's a good time to schedule in some elective procedures if we get there.  **What would you advise I look into?**  Please note I live in a country where healthcare is public, so I would be seeking these things privately.

Sorry in advance for the long post.</p>

<p>My first two periods after my loss in April seemed normal.  However, last cycle (3rd) my period was quite light - I bled for about four-five days in total, but amounts were light-medium during that time, and I never had a heavy bleed which is what is normal for me.  I wrote this off to that cycle being very stressful.  I felt much calmer during the 4th cycle, and thought that if I did have a period, I&#39;d be sure to return to my &#39;normal&#39; as per the first two.</p>

<p>My period started properly yesterday (today is CD2 of cycle 5) and although I had a really good heavy bleed at first (one pad very full), today I&#39;ve woken up to practically nothing on my pad.  This is the same thing that happened during the 3rd cycle in that I would not bleed overnight and then during the day, I&#39;d just not seem to pass that much.  This is not how things used to be pre-loss, or in the first two cycles in that my heaviest bleeds would be overnight (I&#39;d wake up and my pad would be soaked).  I&#39;m worried this cycle will turn out the same.</p>

<p>So, first question: <strong>Could this just be the new normal, or is it possible for problems to emerge months afterwards?</strong>  I had surgery for my loss which was my first pregnancy, but my understanding was that any scarring/blocking is normally apparent quite early on.  There wouldn&#39;t appear to be any (significant) blockage to my cervix in that blood is able to escape, but could I have adhesions that are reducing the quality of my lining?  I had an <a href=""/u/s"">u/s</a> about three weeks&#39; after my surgery, and all appeared to be good with a trilaminar stripe.  I&#39;m also aware that the amount of bleeding doesn&#39;t necessary have any connection to lining quality, so it could just be the way things are now.  My cycles are still regular and I appear by all intents and purposes to be ovulating.</p>

<p>Second question: We are going to keep trying for two more months (six cycles), and then have a break for two months, so I figured that&#39;s a good time to schedule in some elective procedures if we get there.  <strong>What would you advise I look into?</strong>  Please note I live in a country where healthcare is public, so I would be seeking these things privately.</p>

<p>My initial plan is to approach my GP and see if they can offer me anything (probably not, but if I do get anything at this stage it would likely be hormonal tests), maybe get another <a href=""/u/s"">u/s</a> at the mid-point of my cycle, then to seek a private hysteroscopy (HS) and/or hysterosalpingography (HSG).  <strong>Which of the latter two do you think would be best, or do you think there is another surgical procedure that would be better?</strong>  My husband had a semen analysis 12 months ago, and everything was normal - I&#39;d be happy to rule this factor out seeing as we were able to achieve the loss quite quickly.  I&#39;m mainly concerned something might have happened to me post-surgery.</p>

Earlier this week, my husband and I had sex (at the exact 2 week mark) because my doctor had said that as long as I wasn’t bleeding or in pain, it was okay.

When I became pregnant I started to suffer from insomnia for the first time. I would wake at 2 or 3 in the morning and not be able to get back to sleep. After my loss I still have this issue although not severe. I wake instead between 5-6am now. Basically I cannot seem to manage to get more than 6-6.5 hours of sleep a night.

I've been doing CBT-I (cognitive behavorial therapy for insomnia) with the VA so for right now my weekly sleep assignment is to go to bed at 10:45pm and get up at 6am. I have zero issues going to bed at a certain time or falling asleep. I sleep through the night but without fail I can't sleep till 6am. It doesn't matter when I go to sleep I will not manage to get 7 hours of sleep. No matter what when I wake-up my heart is pounding. I think it's a big reason I can't manage to get back to sleep after waking too early. My mind starts going and my heart is pumping hard.

I've done all the good sleep hygiene things too: No electronics/TV an hour before bed, I dim the lights, we got blackout blinds, I sleep with an eye blind and eat plugs, I make sure the room is chilly, I don't stay in bed if I'm not sleep etc. I use blue light blocking glasses. I try not to drink or eat before bed. I've tried melatonin. It's had zero effect for me.

Anyway, has anyone dealt with this kind of a sleep issue and did you find anything that helped? One of the things I find frustrating is that most sleep medications negatively impact fertility and while I do not like pharmaceuticals I'm at a point where I'd be willing to try them but of course since we are TTC there's literally no medication I can take. I've been considering asking my doctor about Zoloft. Figuring maybe possibly I have PTSD/PMDD or something that may be eased by something. I definitely feel like I suffer more emotionally during my luteal phase but to be honest the sleep problem is every phase.

Edit: I'd also like to clarify that I have seen 2 doctors about this. My PCP argued with me that it's normal. I said cancer is normal but no one likes having it. And he basically told me to not come back for a year and to leave him alone (I'm not joking). My obgyn just kept saying it's normal as well and it's very obvious she isn't listening to me or taking notes because she doesn't remember what she tells me in appointments. SO I do have an appointment at the end of the month with a different obgyn to discuss these and other concerns. I'm also working with a counselor at the VA but I have 2 more weeks in their CBT-I program before I can graduate to mental health and getting more help. I know I will get help eventually I just wish I knew what I could do now to make this better.

<p>I&#39;ve been doing CBT-I (cognitive behavorial therapy for insomnia) with the VA so for right now my weekly sleep assignment is to go to bed at 10:45pm and get up at 6am. I have zero issues going to bed at a certain time or falling asleep. I sleep through the night but without fail I can&#39;t sleep till 6am. It doesn&#39;t matter when I go to sleep I will not manage to get 7 hours of sleep. No matter what when I wake-up my heart is pounding. I think it&#39;s a big reason I can&#39;t manage to get back to sleep after waking too early. My mind starts going and my heart is pumping hard.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve done all the good sleep hygiene things too: No electronics/TV an hour before bed, I dim the lights, we got blackout blinds, I sleep with an eye blind and eat plugs, I make sure the room is chilly, I don&#39;t stay in bed if I&#39;m not sleep etc. I use blue light blocking glasses. I try not to drink or eat before bed. I&#39;ve tried melatonin. It&#39;s had zero effect for me.</p>

<p>Anyway, has anyone dealt with this kind of a sleep issue and did you find anything that helped? One of the things I find frustrating is that most sleep medications negatively impact fertility and while I do not like pharmaceuticals I&#39;m at a point where I&#39;d be willing to try them but of course since we are TTC there&#39;s literally no medication I can take. I&#39;ve been considering asking my doctor about Zoloft. Figuring maybe possibly I have PTSD/PMDD or something that may be eased by something. I definitely feel like I suffer more emotionally during my luteal phase but to be honest the sleep problem is every phase.</p>

<p>Edit: I&#39;d also like to clarify that I have seen 2 doctors about this. My PCP argued with me that it&#39;s normal. I said cancer is normal but no one likes having it. And he basically told me to not come back for a year and to leave him alone (I&#39;m not joking). My obgyn just kept saying it&#39;s normal as well and it&#39;s very obvious she isn&#39;t listening to me or taking notes because she doesn&#39;t remember what she tells me in appointments. SO I do have an appointment at the end of the month with a different obgyn to discuss these and other concerns. I&#39;m also working with a counselor at the VA but I have 2 more weeks in their CBT-I program before I can graduate to mental health and getting more help. I know I will get help eventually I just wish I knew what I could do now to make this better. I just want to finish my darn sleep cycle!</p>

I had a MC— the D&C then sent tissue for testing which showed a large gene deletion on chromosome 1 as well as baby embryo was mosaic. My husband and I had karyotype testing done, both normal!

The limitation is that karyotype can’t detect as small of changes as the FISH test can. She said this can find balanced translocations that can then be passed on and cause issues. So she offered the FISH testing but again repeated that it’s highly unlikely this came from us. Did anyone ever have a similar situation? Did you decide to do the FISH test or not? I’m so torn! We have less than 10% chance that this came from us, but I’m also terrified if it did and it happens again but baby survives, poor babe would have severe issues.

This was our first month ttc after a Tfmr at 24 weeks in February. I’ve been pregnant 3 times, have one living child, and all 3 of those happened on the first try so BFN territory is new for me and it hurts way more than I expected.

Of course, if it had been 3 copies, they would have been able to say it was totally random and not inherited by us because neither of us have 3 copies. 

But naturally all of the ""these things usually happen spontaneously"" now has become ""more than likely it's spontaneous, but you and DH should be tested just in case""

So we're getting our karyotype test done next week to see if we have balanced translocations, which would mean these things would likely be messed up causing major birth defects in all future pregnancies...

I'm really really trying to stay positive and believe that we're both fine and this was just a sick twist of fate. But what happened was so rare, I'm finding it hard to trust the numbers again. 

And naturally the doctor was sooooo concerned with my preventing pregnancy until the results come back. I tried to tell her I track my BBT, take ovulation tests, check CM and oh yeah am LL, and being only 3 weeks out from my D&C, I thought it was likely I wouldn't even ovulate before my period. She proceeded to tell me that most accidental pregnancies happen after a loss...

How do I explain to you that we WANT that to happen?!?!

My doctors seem to be at a loss about what is going on with me and where to go next as my husband and I are both fairly young (31) and healthy. Can anyone offer any ideas or help on steps to take moving forward to figure out what is going wrong with my pregnancies or what I can look into to help my future chances?</p>

<p>Update: We just got our d and c results and found out the baby had triploidy and the docs are calling it a partial molar pregnancy. I need to make sure my hcg levels are dropping safely now for awhile before we see what the treatment plan is moving forward.</p>
