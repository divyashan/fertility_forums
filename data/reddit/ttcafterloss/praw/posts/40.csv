After taking a pregnancy test to make sure my HCG levels were undetectable I started tracking O by OPKs and BBT and O'd between April 14-15. Last week I took a series of pregnancy tests which were positive, although not as dark as I remembered them being the first time I got pregnant and I didn't have the sore boobs or fatigue, but I missed my period and told myself that a positive was a positive. I decided to wait until this Friday to test again to give the HCG time to increase before I worried too much about my stagnant lines and went ahead and scheduled an appointment with my doctor for 7.5 weeks (last time we didnt go until 10 and it made the MMC even harder). Well last night I started having some cramping and when I went to the bathroom there was a small amount of blood when I wiped. I did some research and this didn't seem that uncommon at this stage so I put on a pad and decided just to go to sleep and see how things went. At 2am I woke up and knew it was over. My cramps had gotten way worse and I went to the bathroom and it was like a very heavy period. I peed on a stick and it was basically negative.

10,2048,confidence,<praw.reddit.Reddit object at 0x7f12a630cd90>,,ttcafterloss,"I've been lurking for the past three months and figured I am finally ready to share my story. When my MC first happened I couldn't really find any stories like mine, so I hope by sharing this someone who has a similar experience will know they are not alone. 

I found out I was pregnant on December 15th of last year. We told my MIL at Christmas, and my mom the next day. We told our best friends as well so we had others to talk to about it. I didn’t want to tell any extended family yet, but my dad decided he couldn’t wait and told his whole side. My mom told my grandma and practically anyone who would listen. I wish they had listened to me when I told them not to tell anyone, as future events would make it so very awkward for me to see anyone for awhile.

I was 8 weeks for my first appointment. They talked about my medical history and gave me all the resources I could use throughout the pregnancy. They took my blood and I was disappointed that I didn’t get an ultrasound or get to hear a heartbeat. I learned later that they didn’t even do a pregnancy test (this will be relevant later). 

On January 17th, I started spotting. I searched the internet for reasons I could have spotting and it seemed that it was normal as long as it didn't last more than a few days. Unfortunately for me it never stopped. Worried I called the number my clinic gave me to call if I had questions. Oddly enough, that number did not go to their clinic, and I had to be transferred to a nurse line. The nurse I got said I should go in due to how long it was lasting, but since she wasn’t an OB nurse she would call one to ask and make sure. I eventually got transferred to the OB nurse who assured me everything was fine as long as there was no cramping and the blood wasn’t bright red. I didn't have cramps, and it wasn't red. They told me to call back if anything changed. 

I felt relieved after the call and nothing changed until January 29th. Another symptom I had was constipation. I thought maybe that was causing the spotting, which still hadn’t stopped. I looked in the toilet and saw bright red blood. Because it was a Sunday the clinic was closed, so I waited and it seemed there wasn’t really anymore bright red blood so I thought maybe I was just crazy. The next day I saw a little more and called the clinic. This time I asked for an OB nurse. She asked me questions, and told me she would have my midwife contact me either that day or the next. I was called the next day and the midwife said she thought it wasn’t something she was too worried about as it could be due to my endometriosis or a cyst. She didn’t want me to come in for an ultrasound unless I came in for a pregnancy test because there wasn’t a positive pregnancy test on file... I tend to pass out when they take my blood, so we decided I would wait to get it checked out at my 12 week appointment the next week.

Well, I didn't even make it to the next day. Around 3 in the morning I woke up with my hand in something wet. I had to talk myself into going to the bathroom, as I didn’t want confirmation on what I already knew was happening. I got to the bathroom and wasn’t able to leave for another hour. My husband had been  getting ready for work, and needed to use the bathroom. Shaking and cold I told him no I couldn’t leave. He tried to ask me more questions, but I couldn't talk for the fear of breaking down into hysterics. We decided he should still go to work until I could get a time to go to the clinic.

I waited until 8am when the clinic opened to call, as the OB nurse I had called before told me I should only go to the ER if it felt like I was going to die. I gave them a few minutes thinking they would need some time to get settled in. The first time I called I got the operator and then the nurse voicemail. Scared I left a message and waited ten minutes to call back. The second time I was transferred not once, not twice, but four times! By the time I got the last person I choked up because I realized no one was going to help me. I lost it when I got the voicemail again. My husband called right after I got the voicemail and I told him to come home and take me to the ER since I couldn’t get a hold of the clinic. After we hung up I cried so hard it felt like I couldn't breathe.

It was an hour later when I finally got someone from the clinic who called me back. They asked if I wanted to be seen that day, and I said yes. Why wouldn’t I want to be seen? We rushed to the clinic and they told us what we already knew and gave us a packet. 

By the time we had gotten to the clinic the bleeding had gotten worse. I had soaked through the only pad I had and bleed through my underwear. Lucky I was wearing dark brown leggings and a sweater, so no one saw it. 

When we arrived back home, I started loosing everything. I couldn't even leave the shower because after I would clean myself off more blood would come out. I was stuck on my shower floor for 4 hours. When I tried to clean the blood off, more would replace it. It gets even more worse than this, but to shorten it up a bit it was the most traumatizing experience I've ever had, and I wouldn't wish it on my worst enemy. 

I had to stay home from work the next day due to the pain pills they gave me, but I came back two days later. No one knew what had happened besides my supervisor and I was glad. I gave minimal effort in my appearance, and told everyone I was sick. The only bad part was a coworker came up and asked me if “I had any news to tell” her in a very excited tone. I think she had been suspicious that I was pregnant for awhile but I wasn't going to tell anyone at work for a long time. I'm not really sure why it didn't click in her head that something obviously was wrong with me. Luckily I was facing away from her, and gave a short nope. 

It's almost three months later now and I am so angry. I see patient charts that are pregnant and silently swear at them because they made it farther than I did. I see announcements on Facebook and think why do they get to be pregnant and I don't. I really hate listening to music and a song about babies comes on. Anger is probably the most intense feeling I have, and it hasn't really gone away yet. I'll never know why it happened, but I still try to find reasons. Was I eating enough? Was I too rough with my body? Do I have some medical condition the doctors didn't check that cause miscarriage?

When my MC first happened I couldn&#39;t really find any stories like mine, so I hope by sharing this someone who has a similar experience will know they are not alone. </p>

<p>I found out I was pregnant on December 15th of last year. We told my MIL at Christmas, and my mom the next day. We told our best friends as well so we had others to talk to about it. I didn’t want to tell any extended family yet, but my dad decided he couldn’t wait and told his whole side. My mom told my grandma and practically anyone who would listen. I wish they had listened to me when I told them not to tell anyone, as future events would make it so very awkward for me to see anyone for awhile.</p>

<p>I was 8 weeks for my first appointment. They talked about my medical history and gave me all the resources I could use throughout the pregnancy. They took my blood and I was disappointed that I didn’t get an ultrasound or get to hear a heartbeat. I learned later that they didn’t even do a pregnancy test (this will be relevant later). </p>

<p>On January 17th, I started spotting. I searched the internet for reasons I could have spotting and it seemed that it was normal as long as it didn&#39;t last more than a few days. Unfortunately for me it never stopped. Worried I called the number my clinic gave me to call if I had questions. Oddly enough, that number did not go to their clinic, and I had to be transferred to a nurse line. The nurse I got said I should go in due to how long it was lasting, but since she wasn’t an OB nurse she would call one to ask and make sure. I eventually got transferred to the OB nurse who assured me everything was fine as long as there was no cramping and the blood wasn’t bright red. I didn&#39;t have cramps, and it wasn&#39;t red. They told me to call back if anything changed. </p>

<p>I felt relieved after the call and nothing changed until January 29th. Another symptom I had was constipation. I thought maybe that was causing the spotting, which still hadn’t stopped. I looked in the toilet and saw bright red blood. Because it was a Sunday the clinic was closed, so I waited and it seemed there wasn’t really anymore bright red blood so I thought maybe I was just crazy. The next day I saw a little more and called the clinic. This time I asked for an OB nurse. She asked me questions, and told me she would have my midwife contact me either that day or the next. I was called the next day and the midwife said she thought it wasn’t something she was too worried about as it could be due to my endometriosis or a cyst. She didn’t want me to come in for an ultrasound unless I came in for a pregnancy test because there wasn’t a positive pregnancy test on file... I tend to pass out when they take my blood, so we decided I would wait to get it checked out at my 12 week appointment the next week.</p>

<p>Well, I didn&#39;t even make it to the next day. Around 3 in the morning I woke up with my hand in something wet. I had to talk myself into going to the bathroom, as I didn’t want confirmation on what I already knew was happening. I got to the bathroom and wasn’t able to leave for another hour. My husband had been  getting ready for work, and needed to use the bathroom. Shaking and cold I told him no I couldn’t leave. He tried to ask me more questions, but I couldn&#39;t talk for the fear of breaking down into hysterics. We decided he should still go to work until I could get a time to go to the clinic.</p>

<p>I waited until 8am when the clinic opened to call, as the OB nurse I had called before told me I should only go to the ER if it felt like I was going to die. I gave them a few minutes thinking they would need some time to get settled in. The first time I called I got the operator and then the nurse voicemail. Scared I left a message and waited ten minutes to call back. The second time I was transferred not once, not twice, but four times! By the time I got the last person I choked up because I realized no one was going to help me. I lost it when I got the voicemail again. My husband called right after I got the voicemail and I told him to come home and take me to the ER since I couldn’t get a hold of the clinic. After we hung up I cried so hard it felt like I couldn&#39;t breathe.</p>

<p>It was an hour later when I finally got someone from the clinic who called me back. They asked if I wanted to be seen that day, and I said yes. Why wouldn’t I want to be seen? We rushed to the clinic and they told us what we already knew and gave us a packet. </p>

<p>By the time we had gotten to the clinic the bleeding had gotten worse. I had soaked through the only pad I had and bleed through my underwear. Lucky I was wearing dark brown leggings and a sweater, so no one saw it. </p>

<p>When we arrived back home, I started loosing everything. I couldn&#39;t even leave the shower because after I would clean myself off more blood would come out. I was stuck on my shower floor for 4 hours. When I tried to clean the blood off, more would replace it. It gets even more worse than this, but to shorten it up a bit it was the most traumatizing experience I&#39;ve ever had, and I wouldn&#39;t wish it on my worst enemy. </p>

<p>I had to stay home from work the next day due to the pain pills they gave me, but I came back two days later. No one knew what had happened besides my supervisor and I was glad. I gave minimal effort in my appearance, and told everyone I was sick. The only bad part was a coworker came up and asked me if “I had any news to tell” her in a very excited tone. I think she had been suspicious that I was pregnant for awhile but I wasn&#39;t going to tell anyone at work for a long time. I&#39;m not really sure why it didn&#39;t click in her head that something obviously was wrong with me. Luckily I was facing away from her, and gave a short nope. </p>

<p>It&#39;s almost three months later now and I am so angry. I see patient charts that are pregnant and silently swear at them because they made it farther than I did. I see announcements on Facebook and think why do they get to be pregnant and I don&#39;t. I really hate listening to music and a song about babies comes on. Anger is probably the most intense feeling I have, and it hasn&#39;t really gone away yet. I&#39;ll never know why it happened, but I still try to find reasons. Was I eating enough? Was I too rough with my body? Do I have some medical condition the doctors didn&#39;t check that cause miscarriage? </p>

<p>I will say time does help. I&#39;ll never be the same as I was before, and I&#39;ll never forget the 11 weeks I had with my baby. But I&#39;m still holding out hope that I&#39;ll be happy again.</p>

21,2048,confidence,<praw.reddit.Reddit object at 0x7f12a630cd90>,,ttcafterloss,"So I just found out today that my insurance covers RPL testing after two miscarriages. So now the option is available to me and I have no idea where to start. Would I go to an RE for this? Most of the information I've read online about the REs in my area suggests that they are more focused on infertility treatment and IVF. I don't seem to have a problem getting pregnant, just staying pregnant. So I am not sure if I would see an RE or not. I'm pretty sure my regular OB wouldn't do any testing yet because my losses do seem kind of random. The first happened at 15 weeks and the second at 6. So it does seem like just horrible luck, but I don't want to wait until a third to find out there was some underlying cause after all. And I love my doctor's and his staff, but it seems like they are much more equipped to deal with normal healthy pregnancies. They don't seem to deal as well with high risk pregnancy.

So now the option is available to me and I have no idea where to start. Would I go to an RE for this? Most of the information I&#39;ve read online about the REs in my area suggests that they are more focused on infertility treatment and IVF. I don&#39;t seem to have a problem getting pregnant, just staying pregnant. So I am not sure if I would see an RE or not. I&#39;m pretty sure my regular OB wouldn&#39;t do any testing yet because my losses do seem kind of random. The first happened at 15 weeks and the second at 6. So it does seem like just horrible luck, but I don&#39;t want to wait until a third to find out there was some underlying cause after all. And I love my doctor&#39;s and his staff, but it seems like they are much more equipped to deal with normal healthy pregnancies. They don&#39;t seem to deal as well with high risk pregnancy.

I had a MMC at 12 weeks back in March. I had a pretty traumatic experience which I'm struggling to move past. I was not an ideal candidate for a d&c because I had previous surgery on my cervix for cervical cancer and my OB wanted to avoid any additional scarring or damage. So I had several failed rounds of cytotec at home and then ended up being admitted to L&D to induce the mc. I received several more rounds of cytotec over 24 hours and while my cervix dilated a little bit, the tissue would not pass. My ob ended up using forceps to remove what he could manually, while I was completely conscious in the labor suite. This meant my little boy was taken from me piece by piece until I was ultimately rushed down to surgery for a d&c since the placenta adhered to my uterus and I was starting to bleed out. Note, I was not in any significant physical pain during this time and completely trust and respect all of the clinical decisions my OB made. I was just not prepared for the mental anguish which would follow.

To make matters worse, my best friend was also pregnant - just a few weeks ahead of me. I was so excited to go through this experience with her and to have our kids grow up together. After my loss, she was great - respectful and sensitive. She stopped sharing all of the details we once commiserated over, and I understood and appreciated why. However, when it came time for her baby shower, I told her that I couldn't go as it would be too hard for me. I thought she would understand given how supportive she was initially. Instead, she was upset and hasn't spoken to me since. I think my grief/depression started to wear on her during what should be a happy and exciting time in her life, and now my selfishness and inability to be a good friend (albeit out of a sense of self-preservation) likely was the last straw.

My quick background: after a number of years of unexplained infertility I started getting pregnant naturally spring of 2015. I had two miscarriages (one very very early, one at 12 weeks with twins). On the third try we had luck and I stayed pregnant with a beautiful baby girl for a whole 39w5d. 

It was a perfectly normal pregnancy, but she had a couple of heart defects that were discovered after birth. It was a completely operable condition, and although that was mighty scary the doctors were really optimistic, and we left the NICU with a mostly healthy baby. 

Three weeks later she stopped breathing in the reception area for a CT Scan at a wonderful children's hospital -- we were so lucky to have been there when it happened, but she never breathed on her own again. They diagnosed her with tracheal stenosis and told us that it was effectively a time bomb, sooner or later it would catch up with her, it just happened at 3 weeks old.

It's closing in on three months since she died, and while I'm nowhere near ready to get pregnant again, I know deep down that's what I want. Aside from grieving our baby as a person, I am brought back to the years of wondering and grieving ""a baby"" in general. 

My husband was already concerned about being an ""old dad"", he turned 43 on what would have been her 3 month birthday. I'll be 36 this summer, and I feel like we are under a lot of pressure if we ever want to have living children. If we were in our 20s I wouldn't even be making myself think about this right now and would just concentrate on mourning our baby. 

I also spend a decent amount of time reading blogs and scrolling through online support groups. While that is super comforting in the moment, it leaves me with this fatalistic view that babies are statistically more likely to die than live. Before this stillbirth and SIDS were things I was aware of, but I'd only ever known one couple who had a stillbirth. Now it feels like those are the only options after an otherwise healthy pregnancy. You can show me the statistics, but I can show you ten blogs of women who *were* that 1 in 10,000. 

What if I encourage my husband (who's understandably terrified of the whole idea) to try again and we have another baby who then dies of SIDS? I would never forgive myself, and I think we would both just stop living completely. 

What if we try again and face miscarriages again? That's a statistic that's a bit more likely, and still terrifying. 

Any thoughts would be appreciated.

I have put off hoping this sub because I wasn't read to admit it all to myself. H and I have had some pretty shitty life experiences lately. 

We have a 14m son and he is my everything, he is smart and handsome and really one of the best kids I have ever encountered (I am sure there is a little bias in there 😉). We tried for over two years with everything but IVF and IUI before finally getting pregnant and it was a ROUGH pregnancy (subchorionic hematoma, borderline preeclampsia, and I was sick 24/7). Since my first pregnancy was so rough we said we would wait until he is 2-3 to start trying again.

My husband went in for a physical and since he is in his 40's, adopted (no family history) and hadn't seen a doctor since he was like 22 they sent him to a few specialists to help get a better history for him. One of those specialist was a urologist, who saw a small cut on his penis and decided to biopsy it just to be safe. Turns out husband has penile cancer (very very early stages) so with this news we decided to not wait any longer and see what we can do.  

I shockingly got pregnant pretty fast, I had just known I was but wanted to wait for first MP to test but nursing my son was uncomfortable, towels felt like sandpaper and I was peeing all the time (this has been my first symptom with both pregnancies). I was excited but nervous too and thankfully told him don't say a word to anyone until we get a scan. I found a new OB and set up and appt for 8 week scan. 

Within 4 days of our BFP I started spotting, I called the OB told her the history of my SC hematoma with first pregnancy and she said to wait but if bleeding gets worst come in or go to ER for scan to be safe.  I was hopeful that all would be fine and that I just have a shitty uterus that doesn't like to play nice with placentas. Bleeding got very heavy and I went to ER and they were so awfully mean to me.  NP told me I was never ""really"" pregnant and that I probably didn't know how to read a pregnancy test and just go home because I was having a period. OB was furious with them, she requested my records and said it was a textbook ectopic ovarian pregnancy. 

While all of this was going on we found out husbands biopsy did get everything and he needs to go in for another one, they have to take more and hope this time they get it all, if not he needs chemo and that postpones everything by a long time. 

I want another baby so bad but I can't get out of my own way.  I just can't get into it and I feel like sex is a chore.  It's a chore to try and make a baby happen and also a chore to sexually engage my husband before they slice him up again and tell him no stimulation of any kind for like 6 weeks while it heals AGAIN.  I feel awful, I want to want it but I just can't and he definitely notices.

OB was furious with them, she requested my records and said it was a textbook ectopic ovarian pregnancy. </p>

<p>While all of this was going on we found out husbands biopsy did get everything and he needs to go in for another one, they have to take more and hope this time they get it all, if not he needs chemo and that postpones everything by a long time. </p>

<p>I want another baby so bad but I can&#39;t get out of my own way.  I just can&#39;t get into it and I feel like sex is a chore.  It&#39;s a chore to try and make a baby happen and also a chore to sexually engage my husband before they slice him up again and tell him no stimulation of any kind for like 6 weeks while it heals AGAIN.  I feel awful, I want to want it but I just can&#39;t and he definitely notices. </p>

<p>Sorry this was so long and thanks for reading, admitting is the first step to healing right?</p>

I've been super quiet in Reddit the last weeks and months. Loosing my daughter and having a memorial service and whatnot I took a break. 

I've done a few things to help me cope. At least I think it helps. I've opened my own business in her honor and been super busy getting that up and running. I'm barely sleeping bc I work once my 2 year old is in bed.

This year just seems to suck for us though. After all of that pain, hubbys workplace harassment got so bad he had to be placed on suicide watch and was committed to a psych ward for 1 week. It kind of left me and my daughter stranded (no family close. His work sucks. Yay military life) because I don't have a drivers license. Long story. 

I'm so sick of 2017. I haven't managed to go to see my therapist since January. Because his workplace told him he can't clock out at 4:30 to take me to appointments bc he's in a supervisory position and needs to be an example... yeah...

Anyways. Now her due date is coming up. I'm supposed to be 39 weeks pregnant now. For a while I was ok. But now with the due date I'm starting to loose it again. All I want is to be able to hold my little girl. I want those sleepless nights. The growth spurt and constant nursing. 

But instead I get to look at her urn. It's so unfair. My best friend is pregnant as well. She was 4 weeks less than me with a little girl. We were both pregnant at the same time with our first kids as well. And now I told her that I'd be blocking her Facebook posts for a while.

No dramas with that.... bled for a day and then the wait began for my period to arrive. Long story short, residual hormones gave me a false positive in February and hormones still hanging around in March which meant AF still hadn't turned up after almost two months. 

Fast forward to the start of this month and I finally got my period on the 3rd April. Fairly light, brownish blood... which lasted four days. Great... we can start trying again as soon as it's done. My ovulation app was saying the 19th was ovulation day so we're we're aiming for that. 

However the week after I thought my period finished, the blood kicked up a notch and went bright red.... and the cramps.... my god! I have ever experienced anything like that in my entire life and they got that bad that I became physically sick and hubby took me to the local hospital as I was in tears and finding no relief from over the counter medications. ER said I'm not pregnant, therefore ruling out ectopic pregnancy, and I got pain and nausea relief, but they seemed very blasé about my pain and I got the impression they thought I was being melodramatic. 

So on Monday next week, I will have been bleeding for three weeks straight with the last week being utterly brutal due to the cramping. I am physically and emotionally exhausted. I'm scared to go back to the hospital as they really didn't seem to care and in terrified at GP will also fob me off.

Have any other ladies suffered like this or something similar after an extended delay in getting your first period after your loss? What did you do? I'm desperate for advice or just comfort from others you have also had to deal with this....

Further, we aren’t even sure that she’s pregnant. She says she had a vanishing twin miscarriage at 4.5 weeks, but that there is still a viable pregnancy with a sac (u/s at 5 weeks).

I don’t want my child to be a source of pain for others. That’s a hard start and the exact opposite of what a child should be.  I know many think I should forget her and live my life without her influence, but she will influence it just the same through others because the pregnancies/children will be so close.




Tl;dr - I miscarried around the same time that my soon to be ex sister in law conceived. Can’t be sure if she’s being truthful about the pregnancy or a vat of toxic waste that doesn’t want to get a divorce.

**Background on Brother and Sister in Law:**  

This past weekend I learned that my sister in law may be eight weeks pregnant. And while this would normally be a fantastic coincidence (despite my miscarriage), this sister in law has always been difficult. As my husband’s brother’s wife, she has never warmed up to me for reasons that are beyond me. And while this has been a source of disquiet within me to be slighted by her in my attempts to get to know her, I thought that it would resolve itself eventually or she would be divorced out of the family. (Before you think that it was something that I did to her, I can assure you I did nothing but mind my own business. This is a woman that stays on her phone throughout a family dinner, not engaging in conversation, ignoring everyone around her.)  

Their divorce was imminent and it was just a question of when. And unfortunately it has turned ugly; extremely ugly. I’ll forego the details that don’t relate to this story, but what you need to know is that she’s emotionally abusive towards my brother in law while trying to manipulate him to stay with her. She’s also stated to several people that she’s going to drag this out as long as possible. My brother in law uses his phone to record every moment that he is in their house so that there is indisputable proof against “he said”/”she said”. On it’s own without the alleged pregnancy, their divorce is heartbreaking. There is so much unnecessary pain.  

It appears that my brother and sister in law conceived two days before agreeing to move forward with a divorce. My brother in law says that they used a condom because things were rocky, but his wife has since told him that she “tampered” with the condom (she tried to backtrack that statement later). To complicate matters even further, she didn’t tell him until she was five weeks pregnant and suffered a vanishing twin miscarriage. And the way that she told him was over text and part of a backhanded comment regarding fatherhood. I don’t remember the exact text, but it was something along the lines of “well, you were a father for four and a half weeks”.  

She claims that she started bleeding so she hopped into the shower, but she didn’t call her doctor (supposedly because she’s an EMT and knew what was happening). A few days later, she went to a clinic in another state while visiting her mom where they did an ultrasound confirming a viable pregnancy. They told her that the bleeding was probably vanishing twin because they could still see a sac (she was five weeks at this point).  

There are many things that don’t add up, but we can’t NOT believe her until it is confirmed independently by a doctor.  
* First, there is the hopping in the shower. I understand that every woman and every pregnancy is different, but when I had my miscarriage there was no way I was hopping in the shower. I was curled up in front of the toilet going between dry heaving and going number two for about 45 minutes before I passed the tissue. It’s hard for me to imagine that someone could take a shower through that.  
* Second, my brother in law didn’t know if she’s had a serial hcg test, but it didn’t sound like that’s been done. She has her annual gyno appointment in a few weeks that’s been scheduled since before she got “pregnant”, but wouldn’t her doctor want to confirm the pregnancy is viable with serial hcg test especially if there was bleeding to rule out a missed miscarriage?  
* Third, she won’t let my brother in law come to any of the appointments or even talk to the doctor to confirm the pregnancy because it “stresses her out” and she doesn’t want to miscarry the remaining fetus.  
* Fourth, if you calculate her pregnancy from the date they conceived she’s a week behind. She’s saying she’s eight weeks, but the date they conceived would make her nine weeks.",t2_ezmob,False,,0,False,Healing from Miscarriage and Issues with Soon to be Ex Sister in Law,[],r/ttcafterloss,False,0,,0,,,False,t3_65y4vi,False,dark,1.0,,public,9,0,{},,,False,[],,False,False,,{},,False,9,,False,self,False,,[],{},,True,,1492489758.0,text,0,,,text,self.ttcafterloss,False,"<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=""md""><p>As of today, I&#39;m six and a half weeks post miscarriage and almost physically ready to try again.

My husband and I started TTC last August and I was pregnant in the first month. We couldn't believe how lucky we were and we were thrilled. Then at 7 weeks we found out it was ectopic. The tube had already ruptured and I was bleeding internally so I had to have surgery and they removed the right tube. We were advised to wait to ttc again until 1) my periods were regular again and 2) we felt emotionally ready. My periods finally normalized in Feb but I continue to go back and forth on being ready to try again...... 

For those in this group, how did you *know* you were ready to try again?? How long did you wait to try again? And for others who've experienced ectopic pregnancies, how did you overcome the fear of it happening again?

My husband and I started TTC in August of 2016.  My body didn't take to being off birth control very well, and it took 4 months and a round of Provera to get with the program.  I couldn't believe that my cycles really seemed to kick into gear after that - and I was seemingly regular for 3 cycles.  At the end of the 3rd, we got our BFP, and were absolutely over the moon. We found out shortly after getting home from an awesome vacation, where I did *everything* a pregnant person shouldn't... roller coasters, all the alcohol my heart desired, sushi, hot tubs, the whole nine yards. It felt so perfect that our little baby waited until after we'd gone, because when we started planning that vacation (in August) wed somehow deluded ourselves into believing there was no way we wouldn't be pregnant by then, and I wouldn't be able to do any of those things (ha. haha. ha.)

We spent 3 weeks day dreaming about nurseries and announcements and calling our little blob by cute nicknames...we told people (dammit, why did we tell people).  Then my OB called to let me know that my latest beta wasn't good, and I was going to lose it. That was 4 days ago...so we spent 4 days in pregnant limbo - pregnant with a baby that would never exist to anyone but us, and waiting for that baby to die.

Now that I've finally started spotting and feeling generally AF-y, I'm relieved that there is an end in sight and that we can get back on the horse soon... but it still hurts so bad.  The dreams of our December baby are over. The tiny Red Converse I bought for our announcement and the afghan I started crocheting no longer have an owner.  I know it was early... today would be 6w+2, and statistically it's not at all uncommon but... this was never supposed to be part of our story. Before now miscarriage felt like something that only happens to *other* people, it would never happen to *us*.  I now know how fucking stupid that is.

104,2048,confidence,<praw.reddit.Reddit object at 0x7f12a630cd90>,,ttcafterloss,"I've been here for awhile (about six weeks or so?), but I thought I would make an official introduction post. My name is Maggie, and I lost my son in February when I was thirty-five weeks along. I didn't have as long of a wait for my first pregnancy as some, but I had been actively trying for a baby and was EXTREMELY excited for my baby boy. When I was about 12 weeks along, my BIL jokingly called my baby ""lil' Raffael"". It had made us laugh, and it soon became a running joke to call the bump Raffael at every turn. I, always a fan of the spontaneous and fun twists of life, of course fell in love with the name, as did my husband. It was not too out there, and it just felt so right. I already felt I was having a boy, but now I wanted it to be true even more.

(TW: happy ultrasound/doctor visits, and lots of gross happy moments lol) We got every ultrasound we could. At 14 weeks, my doctor was ready to place a bet that we would have a boy. Then, at 17 weeks he thought he may have seen girl parts. At 21 weeks, we got an anatomy scan. Still no luck. We laughed it off. We would love our Raffael even if he was a girl. Lol. (Of course, the name would have to change. :P) At 32 weeks, we finally saw the boy bits. Our ultrasound tech was a little hesitant to say for sure, but I was convinced. I immediately bought a blue cake and invited my family over for a simple gender reveal. I had a lot of fun and smiled so much my cheeks hurt. You should see the picture we posted to Facebook. Back then, it was annoyingly happy. Today, it's absolutely heartbreaking. Funny how that changed so suddenly.

Soon after, I was 35 weeks pregnant, and I couldn't feel Raff's rambunctious kicks anymore. I immediately remembered all the things I had read about babies kicking less because they had less room. It comforted me a little, but this was not the energetic boy I had gotten to know. We went to the hospital. I was not my usual self because I was worried. My husband tried all sorts of jokes, and I could only manage weak smiles. I'm glad he tried, though. It made me think maybe this wasn't as serious as I thought.

It was even more serious than I thought.

My doctor was away on vacation, so the nurses searched for a heartbeat with the doppler. The searching was so much quieter than what I was used to. For the first time, I wondered not if Raff was okay but if he was even still with me. I remember looking at my husband in a bit of a panic. The nurse noticed and shook her head fiercely. ""No,"" she said pointedly, already knowing where my thoughts were. ""Don't go there. The baby might be in a weird position. Let me order you an ultrasound.""

I'm glad she said it, because I would have driven myself insane with tears if she hadn't. But it only delayed the inevitable. After probably another hour and a half, we got our ultrasound. The room was dead silent, with about five more people than usual. Of course something was wrong, there was no denying it. But I needed to hear it. My husband and I gave each other comforting smiles as they finally got a doctor in the room. He looked at the ultrasound for an eternity.

And then he said the words that broke my heart into a million pieces. ""Your baby's heart isn't beating."" He said it with compassion, and I could tell it hurt him a lot to say it. I later found out he and his wife had gone through the same thing. He was a good doctor for the situation, but he had a hard time looking at me whenever we spoke. Anyway, we went through the whole ordeal of labor and giving birth, and I finally got to see the little person I had spent so long germinating. It was awful. It was wonderful. It sucked that the most beautiful person I had ever seen was dead. Those words may not be elegant, but they're true.

Anyway, here I am. I'm glad to have you, if you'll have me. I hate that we're here, but I'm so glad I'm not the only one to have gone through this. I've also just started a blog.

My ob/gyn didn't even think I would ovulate that cycle but I did, just late, and my pregnancy was confirmed via HPTs and multiple blood tests.

Anyways, a couple of days later, my progesterone dramatically dropped to 2.9 and I lost the baby 2 days later (last weekend).

**Buckle up this is majorly long, but so therapeutic in writing <3 No worries if you TL;DR!**

Here's a bit of my story. Back in 8/15, I forgot to pick up my BC pills, and stumbled into a surprise pregnancy. I was all ""ooh look at me and my super fertile woman powers""--yeah THAT girl. I read everything I could find on pregnancy, birth, babies, etc., with one exception: the second I read the word miscarriage, I skipped the paragraph. No way that would apply to me. NEXT

On the evening of Oct 1, I looked down to see the bright red blood. Over the next 10 hours, I miscarried naturally at 8 weeks. I was devastated.

This pregnancy convinced us that we were indeed ready to start a family. After waiting three months, we tried for 6 months. The due date came and went, and marked CD 1 of a cycle where we once again found ourselves pregnant. Oh. What. Joy. We told our closest friends and I told my boss. I had just been promoted and was working under a new supervisor. The summer months were our craziest, so I needed her to know I would be out for Drs. appts. Plus, she was a bit of a sour puss and I hoped that by telling her my story, she might empathize a bit and wouldn't hold it against me if I needed to be out for an afternoon. 

I must say, I kind of gave this pregnancy the stiff arm. I didn't want to get too attached. I was still super hopeful, but I had so many walls up when it came to just loving this baby. I didn't want to hurt again.

I had an appt at 6w+5, where baby was only measuring at 4w+6. My Dr. said I probably just ovulated late, but I knew my dates and knew it wasn't progressing. I began spotting at 7w. Within 2 days, the bleeding and cramping intensified. I told my boss that I was actively miscarrying and may need to leave work. This was THE busiest day of the year: the last in a string of five 14 hr work days. She was scheduled to leave for vacation that afternoon, and essentially told me I needed to stay, and she couldn't believe how selfish people could be with there time off...I mean...she had been planning her trip for MONTHS (ugh). Being young, eager to please, and oblivious to my rights, I stayed, and hid the emotional and physical pain best I could. 

I walked in the door that night at 9pm, and completed the miscarriage by 10pm. I crawled right back in bed and went to sleep. I don't even think I cried.


For the sake of length, here's a summary of what's happened since then:
-My stiff-armed pregnancy left me in a void I couldn't even recognize. I slowly crumbled. I harbored intense resentment for my job, supervisor, and my body. As I let myself get mad, I also let myself get sad. I quit that job 3 months later. It was terrifying, but has proven to be the absolute best decision.
-My OB did a fertility work up 3 months later. All has come back ""normal,"" which puts me firmly in the ""Unexplained"" category. He did put me on low-dose aspirin 
-I've been working from home the last 6 months. Those first two months I just let myself be really really sad. Since then, I've balanced healthy work with a healthy lifestyle. I've lost 10lbs, started exercising again, joined a church, and revitalized my marriage. I think I was borderline PCOS (although my Dr never said so) but essentially all of my related symptoms have subsided since modifying my diet. 
-We are coming up on a year since our last conception, and we are 20 months into this journey all together. That sucks. I recognize it may only be a fraction of your journey--sending you love my sister. 


There have been invaluable lessons in these losses and in this waiting. I am a different woman. When I think of the mother I will one day be, I am proud of her. She will be so strong, and her babies will be so precious.

But the truth is, a part of me envies the girl I was 20 months ago. Of course my MCs robbed me of two babies, but they also robbed me of that innocence and optimism and JOY. By the time my second pregnancy came around, those were gone, and the walls were up. 

So my vow is to let that girl be a part of me once again. No more stiff-arming from me. The second I see those two lines, I'm going to jump up and down (gently of course...haha...let's not get crazy) and cry tears of PURE JOY. I am going to fall. in. love. with that baby, I'm going to think to myself ""look at me and my super fertile woman powers."" After all, those walls are only meant to protect me, and that baby will deserve more. I am filled to the brim with hope. 


If you've made it this far, you're pretty super. I recognize that all of our stories are so very different, with those common threads that bind us. Maybe some of this sounds familiar, or maybe you've taken a totally different road when it comes to coping, healing, and celebrating. Either way, my heart goes out to you and I can't wait to learn from you and heal with you. Much love, sisters!

<p>I walked in the door that night at 9pm, and completed the miscarriage by 10pm. I crawled right back in bed and went to sleep. I don&#39;t even think I cried.</p>

<p>For the sake of length, here&#39;s a summary of what&#39;s happened since then:
-My stiff-armed pregnancy left me in a void I couldn&#39;t even recognize. I slowly crumbled. I harbored intense resentment for my job, supervisor, and my body. As I let myself get mad, I also let myself get sad. I quit that job 3 months later. It was terrifying, but has proven to be the absolute best decision.
-My OB did a fertility work up 3 months later. All has come back &quot;normal,&quot; which puts me firmly in the &quot;Unexplained&quot; category. He did put me on low-dose aspirin 
-I&#39;ve been working from home the last 6 months. Those first two months I just let myself be really really sad. Since then, I&#39;ve balanced healthy work with a healthy lifestyle. I&#39;ve lost 10lbs, started exercising again, joined a church, and revitalized my marriage. I think I was borderline PCOS (although my Dr never said so) but essentially all of my related symptoms have subsided since modifying my diet. 
-We are coming up on a year since our last conception, and we are 20 months into this journey all together. That sucks. I recognize it may only be a fraction of your journey--sending you love my sister. </p>

<p>There have been invaluable lessons in these losses and in this waiting. I am a different woman. When I think of the mother I will one day be, I am proud of her. She will be so strong, and her babies will be so precious.</p>

<p>But the truth is, a part of me envies the girl I was 20 months ago. Of course my MCs robbed me of two babies, but they also robbed me of that innocence and optimism and JOY. By the time my second pregnancy came around, those were gone, and the walls were up. </p>

<p>So my vow is to let that girl be a part of me once again. No more stiff-arming from me. The second I see those two lines, I&#39;m going to jump up and down (gently of course...haha...let&#39;s not get crazy) and cry tears of PURE JOY. I am going to fall. in. love. with that baby, I&#39;m going to think to myself &quot;look at me and my super fertile woman powers.&quot; After all, those walls are only meant to protect me, and that baby will deserve more. I am filled to the brim with hope. </p>

<p>If you&#39;ve made it this far, you&#39;re pretty super. I recognize that all of our stories are so very different, with those common threads that bind us. Maybe some of this sounds familiar, or maybe you&#39;ve taken a totally different road when it comes to coping, healing, and celebrating. Either way, my heart goes out to you and I can&#39;t wait to learn from you and heal with you. Much love, sisters!</p>
