I've been lurking here for a few weeks now. I am officially about to embark on my TTC After Loss journey.

My husband and I recently lost our beautiful baby boy at 24 weeks. As everyone here would know, nothing can quite prepare you for the shock and heartache that's to follow. For the sake of anonymity I won't type his name, but I know he is always with me.

Naturally the first thing I did was google Stillbirth to understand what had happened, what had I done? Could I have prevented it? At this stage we have no answers. My blood tests came back normal, although we are still waiting on the results of the autopsy and placenta histology. I fear we may never know the answers, I'm bracing myself for that. I strongly suspect there is a clotting issue as I bled A LOT throughout the pregnancy although they could never find anything on the scans. It was an abnormal amount in my opinion.

For us, TTC is the first thing on our minds. My GP and OB have both given the clear, indicating there is no need to wait. I have been fortunate in that my body has returned to ""normal"" quite quickly. Here I am day 2 of my first period post birth.

So here goes, this is our first cycle trying. We were NTNP when we fell pregnant last time so this will be my first time properly tracking and giving it a red hot go.

Nothing can replace our son but we do really want to bring another child into the world.

Hi! I’m new, so I wanted to introduce myself. I’m 38, my husband is 37, and we’ve been trying for five years. It’s been a roller coaster:

- Miscarriage at 7 weeks
- Infant loss when our first son was 3 weeks old. He had open heart surgery, and afterward his doctors realized he had a rare, randomly occurring genetic mutation that caused birth defects in his heart, trachea, and esophagus that weren’t compatible with life. I had postpartum preeclampsia with this pregnancy, too.
- Miscarriage at 7 weeks
- Chemical pregnancy 
- Chemical pregnancy 
- Our second son was born :)
- Miscarriage at 8 weeks
- Chemical pregnancy 
- Miscarriage at 8 weeks

We *finally* had a full fertility work up, and it didn’t reveal much: My thyroid function is heathy. No celiac disease, clotting disorders, autoimmune problems, or markers for increased inflammation. I need more vitamin D, B12, and iron, so I’m starting extra supplements. My AMH isn’t great, but it’s not unusual for my age. I’m still waiting for the results of my karyotype. My husband’s karyotype came back normal.

Today my Inheritest results came back. I’m a carrier of two incredibly uncommon genetic syndromes, but those syndromes shouldn’t cause miscarriages. And any child I have would not have those genetic syndromes unless my husband is a carrier, too. He’s going to be tested for them later this week.

Since my doctor can’t find an obvious cause for our losses, she wants me to start taking progesterone if/when I get pregnant again.

I’m exhausted and so consumed with TTC, it’s hard to enjoy life. I don’t really want to keep trying anymore, but my husband desperately wants one more child. And it’s possible that progesterone could change everything. So we continue. 

It sucks to be here, but it’s good to be with people who get it. I lost a lot of friends after our son died. People disappear because they don’t know what to say, and it’s just awkward.

I knew the HSG would suck for me, even though so many people say “it’ll be fine, just uncomfortable”. I had a rotten experience getting my iud inserted too, so was anticipating the worst. It wasn’t the procedure itself being too painful so much as my body’s reaction shortly after.

I was told what a lovely community this is, and I need some support right now as I'm dealing with some feelings and have some questions for those who are/were in similar situations. I'm currently going through the end result of an early ectopic pregnancy. I was about five weeks pregnant when I suddenly experienced severe pain on my left side that radiated down my thigh for about two days off and on, followed by bleeding which ultimately lead to the end of the pregnancy. The doctor confirmed there was a mass on or near my left ovary, which at first they weren't sure was a burst corpus luteum cyst or ectopic pregnancy. It was too early for them to see a sac. The days after I was in terrible pain and free floating fluid in my abdomen. Bottom line is after multiple blood tests and scans over the past week, it was confirmed today that it was indeed ectopic, and (thankfully?) the pregnancy ending prevented this from being a life-threatening situation. The mass is going down, as are my betas, but bleeding is consistent - not heavy, but also thankfully not internal. I'm in a wait and see situation at this point.

I feel such sadness for the loss of this pregnancy and anxiety from the health scare that we have to continue to monitor. I know it could have been much, much worse which much more invasive measures. I have a wonderful two year old son that I had an incredible pregnancy with, and I guess that makes me so much more sad that this unexpectedly happened. I've never had any previous issues related to fertility or health.

My doctor said these things happen, but when we want to think about trying again she suggests a HSG test to ensure there are no blockages or scar tissue. Has anyone else in my situation had an HSG and mind sharing their results?

I feel like TTC post MC is all I can think about, while simultaneously being the only thing I can't be doing. Thank you everyone for being here.

My HCG levels are taking forever to get to zero (under 6). 9 weeks post D&C for a MMC that happened 3 weeks prior I'm still at around 25 HCG. They have been falling slowly, but I've had two periods post D&C. I also have 2 simple Cysts (one on each overy) about the size of a watch face. There's no retained tissue. There's also a few fibroids but they are actually smaller than the last US weeks ago. 

I don't know what to do with this information. I'm hurting, physically (bloated, crampy, insomnia, and uncomfortable) and emotionally (anxious, paranoid to take any medicine that could cause problems TTC or to future pregnancy, miffed at endless waiting) and I feel super alone in the process. I'm maybe producing eggs but I can't get them out of my overies because of the HCG and as far as I know all we can do is just ... Wait. The doc says the cysts should go away in 60-90 days. She says I will probably ovulate when HCG is near zero, but the last draw only saw a reduction of 4 in the levels, and it's been slowing down each week, which means I may have one more cycle (and cysts?) or more before I actually have the chance to conceive. I'm scared to rupture the cysts and not willing to be intimate with my husband until I know I'm ovulating again. 

Has anyone been here? I'm just so exhausted from worry and wish I had more insight and information. Have you dealt with any of this? How did it go? Did anything help the situation?

But that still doesn’t change the fact that I’m scared.

The obvious solution is don’t go, but the thing is I want to go, I didn’t go last year because I was pregnant and I always had a lot of fun the other two years, also I’m sick of avoiding events because of my fears and anxiety of seeing pregnant women or old friends. My husband is an Air Force pilot so our social life heavily revolves around that scene. Although since losing Oliver in April I haven’t been to a single event. The holiday party is kids free and there’s alcohol so there’s the plus. 

The thing is the entire squadron knows what happened to us, my husband took time off work and they provided food for us for a month. However, I’ve pretty much been invisible the last few months and I’m scared of resurfacing. I’ve changed, I’m not the same person I was, I’ve ghosted everyone I was close to, I haven’t seen them since April, I deleted facebook and I don’t text them, one of them, my former best friend, had her husband tell mine that she's been hurting since I exited her life.... my response was shrug too bad I'm hurting too, from losing my son, and she just gave birth to a healthy baby boy without ever seeing a Doctor so she can complain about being lonely to someone else.   
I’ve started making new friends with females that don’t have kids and aren’t TTC. I’m scared that by resurfacing my old friends will think “Oh Monstera is back!” but that isn’t the case, I can’t go back to those friendships, at most I’m willing to do a friendly hello and walk away. It’s painful knowing all these former friends have gone on to have babies… it’s jealousy. But also my life has changed in a way that they will never understand, and as a result, I’m a different person, you don’t cremate your only child and expect not to change.  
 

So I’m scared, I’m scared of going and feeling like I have a scarlet letter on my head, I’m scared of people thinking that I’m OK now and it’s the old me, and I’m scared of being confronted with my former self/life that I have separated from.

* April 2019 - ectopic pregnancy that was diagnosed at 6 weeks and was treated with two injections of methotrexate. No surgery, and as far as I know, both tubes are intact.

This is going to be a long & painful one, but I really need to get it off my chest. 

We've been trying since April. We got lucky on the first cycle. Unfortunately I only found out the day before I found out it was ectopic. I kind of knew it. I had a positive test on (what I thought was) CD10, so I figured it wasn't going to be a good situation and didn't allow myself to get my hopes up. Honestly, for the women who have a loss after weeks/months I can only imagine how devastating that must be. 

I couldn't get into the OB for 3 weeks, and I knew I would drive myself crazy waiting that long. The woman who made the appointment said ""so you're pregnant and you're bleeding?"" It sounded so bad when she said it like that.

I went to urgent care. I went alone. I was afraid it would be fine and I'd have wasted my husband's time. I doubted myself, I was worried I would be the first time mom who overreacts at every little thing. I think we do this a lot as women. 

I wish I remembered the name of the urgent care doctor because I would like to write her a letter. She looked me in the eye and said we can't help you here, but you can't wait 3 weeks. It's too dangerous. You need to go to the ER today. I needed that validation so bad. She made me tell her which one I was going to, and she called ahead to tell them I was coming. 

I did okay dealing with the ER, the testing, the diagnosis, the treatment. I was actually relieved that I went alone. I needed it to be my decision, not our decision. Then came the consent form. I don't know why but the doctor made me read it out loud. The first line was ""I understand that I have an ectopic pregnancy that is not viable."" I just broke down. The doctor asked why I was crying, not in a puzzled way but I think as a way of making sure I was okay. She pressed me for details. But I really didnt want to talk about it with her. I barely knew her. 

The medicine came in a bag marked ""Cancer"" in big red letters. I was pretty numb by then. The nurse was very kind, with a kind voice. It hadn't hit me yet that that moment was going to kill my baby. I know logically that the pregnancy couldn't continue and would kill me if I didnt end it. I know it was a clump of cells, a yolk sac. I'm not pro-life. But this isn't a logical experience. Its visceral. 

I took the long weekend to deal with the physical pain and emotional grief. My husband and mom helped me so much. I took another hour or so of crying on a camping trip a couple weeks later when my betas went to zero and I was officially not pregnant anymore. And then I moved on. Or thought I did. 

We went back to trying as soon as we could. I'm thankful for the TTC reddit community. I've learned so much, but also felt so supported, and I'm so happy to give support to other women. 

Just this past week though I finally broke down. It all came up, everything I'd been pushing down. My would-be due date is coming up. I was hoping if I was pregnant by then it wouldn't be so bad, but it looks like that's not happening. I made my first appointment with an RE and admit that I can't do it on my own. I had to write down all the medical details. It's the first time I had to check the ""have you ever been pregnant?"" box. I skipped Thanksgiving because my mom was sick and I could have been pregnant. I missed it for nothing. Then there's Christmas. I'd be 8 months pregnant. I wouldn't be able to fly to see my in-laws like we're planning. I'd be buying baby clothes and toys for my baby, not just my nieces.

I know I need to feel the feelings. It sucks, but it's necessary. It's normal. I'm spending the weekend partly keeping busy and partly having down time to cry and grieve. And so here I am. Putting down all the details to a group of women that I hope will understand.

————————————

Quick background: 2 miscarriages since July. One was mmc with d and e in July at 8 (should have been 10) weeks. Second was blighted ovum with second d and e in October. I never met with the ob I intended to see — i ultimately met with the woman who was on call performing the procedure that day. So during my 2 weeks follow up, she ultimately agrees to do some testing on me. Turns out I likely have a thyroid condition. She also asked me to come in for a sonohysogram during my recent period. They ultimately couldn’t get me in, and called me as late as humanly possible (aka 4pm on Tuesday before thanksgiving — which meant I had 2 days, including thanksgiving, to get the testing) to tell me that so I couldn’t go somewhere else. I talk to my provider and she says that they were gonna just look for uterine abnormalities. Guess what doctor — you’re in luck! I had an MRI completed at another practice 1 year ago looking at the same stuff. They told me everything was fine so this should be sufficient. She is basically like “great — send it over. I’ll take a look at it and call you back with my thoughts soon.” I sent it over to her last Tuesday.  I take a quick look at the progress note and see a potential diagnosis that my old doctor never even mentioned. “Hm. That’s funny— they never mentioned it.. let me google. Holy shit everything listed it all about infertility and miscarriages with this new diagnosis. Holy fuck I am freaking out. Can’t wait to hear from my doctor about this so I can discuss treatment options!” No response on wed. “That’s cool — I’ll just drive myself crazy and be miserable until after thanksgiving. Surely she’ll put me out of my misery on Monday.” I call at the end of the day on Monday to ask whether someone can call to discuss the results. “No big deal Bountiful, you’re doctor isn’t here right now but I’ll make a note for her and ask that she call you. She’ll reach out tomorrow.” I write her a follow up message on my patient portal explaining my concerns after reading research and up to date articles. I thank her for baring with me - that I’m having a hard time and just would prefer to talk to her than keep torturing myself with internet searches. Tuesday comes and goes and I hear absolutely nothing. I wake up on Wednesday and I am literally gushing blood and my blood pressure is 80/50. I feel like I’m going to fall over and can barely eat anything. I call the office to tell them I’m concerned considering I had my first post miscarriage period like 2 weeks ago... this can’t be normal — there are tons of clots and it’s literally all Over me and looks like a dark black. “Oh bountiful, that’s normal”..... I took plan b in early November bc I wanted to be medicated for my thyroid issue before getting pregnant again— very hard decision.... “but we suggest you go to another doctor bc we can’t help you with your blood pressure issue. Consider going to the er.” Me: “Great thanks for your help.. also can you ask my doctor to call? I’ve been waiting for Over a week to discuss this other diagnosis and I’m starting to lose my mind over it.” Her: “Oh bountiful she’s not here today — she will be back tomorrow.” Me: “Ok well, she isn’t even the doctor i wanted to see for my ob care. Dr xyz is. Can you ask her or literally anyone to look and just tell me their impressions?” Her: “Sure, I’ll make them aware and someone will call you later.”  Me: “thank you so much — I really appreciate it.”

30 hours later and I’m still waiting for this damn call.  Is this appropriate?? I work in healthcare and need to find coverage if I cannot answer my existing patients questions within 24 hours. The medical doctors where I work have 2 days to respond to secure messages. It has literally been 9 days since I sent the mri results and I am going Crazy. She doesn’t even have to do anything — all she has to do is tell
Me what the diagnosis means and what my treatment options are. Now I feel like a pain in the ass patient since I’ve been calling the office and feel too anxious to call again. Am I being unreasonable? Is this bad patient care or are my expectations to high since I treat my own patients with dignity and respect and recognize urgency when I hear it? Jeeeez.

———————————-
After hearing from a few of you, talking to my pcp at an annual visit, and considering the fact that I would never treat my own patients this way, I decided to call the office today to understand what is happening. I call and request to speak with the nurse manager, explaining what is happening and that I want to understand why I never heard back from the doctor. I’m transferred to the nurse line. I start sobbing explaining the story and emphasize that I just want to understand why my doctor won’t call me back ... that I feel such a lack of control over my body and I just need someone to help me or give me direction and I don’t understand what I’ve done wrong for this to be happening. I was put on hold for 25 minutes. The nurse comes back and explains that my doctor was here this week but that she went on vacation!!!! They reached her on vacation and learned ther she was very busy this week (not to say I’m not important of course) but that I clearly have a lot of questions and keep calling their office looking for help, so my doctor would like me to come in to discuss these results and doesn’t feel comfortable discussing it over the phone. I first inquire about their protocol for coverage when their staff is out of the office. I am required to develop a contingency plan for my own patients if I’m out of the office — is this what I can expect if I come here and ultimately have a baby? She explains that no... my doctor just knows my medical history and has been working with me, so other doctors won’t be able to help me — they defer to her. I explain that I already said to two other nurses that I actually wanted to meet with the other doctors who I initially joined the practice for— I’d like to talk to them instead of this woman. They said I need to wait and meet with this person, but she will not meet with me for 3 weeks!!!! Bc that’s when she returns from vacation!!! I ask if it’s standard care there where patients can’t choose their own doctors — do I not have a choice? I also asked is it typical for a patient to ultimately wait 1.5 weeks to hear from their providers? Is this what I can expect if I have a baby? They said no, of course not. I tell them that I would have understood if they just told me from the beginning that i needed to schedule an appointment. I would have understood if someone gave me an accurate timeline. I would have understood if someone told me she was on vacation; even! But nobody told me anything. Everyone said tomorrow. Tomorrow. Tomorrow. I gave a lot of feedback about their patient care practices, hung up the phone, and cried. The doctor left me a voicemail while I was caring for my own patients. She reiterated she wouldn’t talk about this over the phone but will ultimately ask me to get a sonohystogram and possibly refer me to an re. Fuck her. I will not call hr back. I do not trust her. If I didn’t call today, I would have waited another three weeks! The whole thing was incredibly upsetting and I felt so shamed for calling in and asking questions about my care. I have been so depressed the past few weeks and this is just throwing me over the edge. I just feel like absolute crap that this happened and now I feel like a terrible pain in the ass— that I have label on me at this practice. I also feel so upset that they hear how upset I am and worried I feel, and the earliest they can see me is 3 weeks? I feel like that says a lot about. Where should I go from here? My aunt is a nurse practitioner and suggested I write a letter and explain my experience, switch practices, etc. I’m gonna look for a new ob, but I have no clue how to find a good one. I’m also considering just bypassing all this bullshit and calling an RE. I just feel so stuck and confused. Did I do something wrong? Should I not have called? I just feel so disheartened and sad right now.

124,2048,confidence,<praw.reddit.Reddit object at 0x7f12a630cd90>,,ttcafterloss,"apologies for the below novel, i need to vent a little and express my confusion a bit with hopes of some advice.

first off - i'm very sorry that any of us have had to go through this. and i'm thankful that reddit is here to help us not feel so alone while we heal and move forward.

as some background: im 35, we had been trying for a year, it was my first pregnancy. i actually had my first appointment at a fertility clinic to discuss IUI and potentially IVF and didn't know i was already pregnant at that appointment! obviously we were excited for my first ultrasound, but that's when they discovered i had an ectopic pregnancy. it had been 6.5 weeks, i had no symptoms, and thankfully it had not ruptured (the drs were shocked it hadn't bc they said it was large) but i did lose the pregnancy and my right tube. i was rushed into emergency surgery and the whole thing was traumatic and i was in shock for a few days about it. after the shock, i went through what are probably normal phases - sadness, random crying, asking myself why, googling how this happened, not wanting to leave home or see anyone, etc. but now i'm back to my day to day life and ok. work has helped a lot with that, and i'm lucky to have a great support system in my husband, friends, and family.

the part that has been hard and may seem silly, but that 2 of my closest friends are pregnant right now. the 3 of us were so excited that it just happened that we all going to be pregnant together... and now it's hard because i see their cute bump pics and stories about pregnancy and it's all constant reminders of what happened to me and where i am NOT anymore. this has probably been the hardest part of my emotional healing. how am i supposed to move forward and move on, and be happy for my close friends? they've done absolutely nothing wrong, so i feel bad when i start getting upset instead of being happy for them, it's all very confusing.

<p>as some background: im 35, we had been trying for a year, it was my first pregnancy. i actually had my first appointment at a fertility clinic to discuss IUI and potentially IVF and didn&#39;t know i was already pregnant at that appointment! obviously we were excited for my first ultrasound, but that&#39;s when they discovered i had an ectopic pregnancy. it had been 6.5 weeks, i had no symptoms, and thankfully it had not ruptured (the drs were shocked it hadn&#39;t bc they said it was large) but i did lose the pregnancy and my right tube. i was rushed into emergency surgery and the whole thing was traumatic and i was in shock for a few days about it. after the shock, i went through what are probably normal phases - sadness, random crying, asking myself why, googling how this happened, not wanting to leave home or see anyone, etc. but now i&#39;m back to my day to day life and ok. work has helped a lot with that, and i&#39;m lucky to have a great support system in my husband, friends, and family.</p>

Thankfully, we have the savings to cover it... but that savings was for when we have our baby, and now we'll have very little for when that time finally comes.

I know this is an unpopular opinion, but sometimes I wish people would ask me about our plans for \[more\] children.

Second was blighted ovum with second d and e in October. I never met with the ob I intended to see — i ultimately met with the woman who was on call performing the procedure that day. So during my 2 weeks follow up, she ultimately agrees to do some testing on me. Turns out I likely have a thyroid condition. She also asked me to come in for a sonohysogram during my recent period. They ultimately couldn’t get me in, and called me as late as humanly possible (aka 4pm on Tuesday before thanksgiving — which meant I had 2 days, including thanksgiving, to get the testing) to tell me that so I couldn’t go somewhere else. I talk to my provider and she says that they were gonna just look for uterine abnormalities. Guess what doctor — you’re in luck! I had an MRI completed at another practice 1 year ago looking at the same stuff. They told me everything was fine so this should be sufficient. She is basically like “great — send it over. I’ll take a look at it and call you back with my thoughts soon.” I sent it over to her last Tuesday.  I take a quick look at the progress note and see a potential diagnosis that my old doctor never even mentioned. “Hm. That’s funny— they never mentioned it.. let me google. Holy shit everything listed it all about infertility and miscarriages with this new diagnosis. Holy fuck I am freaking out. Can’t wait to hear from my doctor about this so I can discuss treatment options!” No response on wed. “That’s cool — I’ll just drive myself crazy and be miserable until after thanksgiving. Surely she’ll put me out of my misery on Monday.” I call at the end of the day on Monday to ask whether someone can call to discuss the results. “No big deal Bountiful, you’re doctor isn’t here right now but I’ll make a note for her and ask that she call you. She’ll reach out tomorrow.” I write her a follow up message on my patient portal explaining my concerns after reading research and up to date articles. I thank her for baring with me - that I’m having a hard time and just would prefer to talk to her than keep torturing myself with internet searches. Tuesday comes and goes and I hear absolutely nothing. I wake up on Wednesday and I am literally gushing blood and my blood pressure is 80/50. I feel like I’m going to fall over and can barely eat anything. I call the office to tell them I’m concerned considering I had my first post miscarriage period like 2 weeks ago... this can’t be normal — there are tons of clots and it’s literally all Over me and looks like a dark black. “Oh bountiful, that’s normal”..... I took plan b in early November bc I wanted to be medicated for my thyroid issue before getting pregnant again— very hard decision.... “but we suggest you go to another doctor bc we can’t help you with your blood pressure issue. Consider going to the er.” Me: “Great thanks for your help.. also can you ask my doctor to call? I’ve been waiting for Over a week to discuss this other diagnosis and I’m starting to lose my mind over it.” Her: “Oh bountiful she’s not here today — she will be back tomorrow.” Me: “Ok well, she isn’t even the doctor i wanted to see for my ob care. Dr xyz is. Can you ask her or literally anyone to look and just tell me their impressions?” Her: “Sure, I’ll make them aware and someone will call you later.”  Me: “thank you so much — I really appreciate it.”

I have had two losses this year and I’m not sure where to go from here. 

My first loss was a complete, natural miscarriage in January at 6w. My second loss was a MMC at 10w with a D&E. We did not do any testing.

My cycles are super irregular (always have been, whether it was due to birth control, before that being underweight/hyperthyroid, other unknown reasons.) 

I recently went to my endocrinologist and my thyroid levels are all normal. Did other hormonal testing and things looked fine there too. 

I just don’t know what to do next. I’m finally at the place mentally where I’m wanting to try again whereas a month ago the thought made me incredibly anxious and wasn’t even an option in my mind. 

My midwife said she could refer me to an RE, but I know the ones she would refer me to are all men at our hospital, and I’d prefer a woman. I don’t know anyone that has experience with any RE’s in my area so I can’t ask anyone personally for a recommendation. I don’t want to just go to a fertility clinic and they empty my wallet, you know? I’m also super, super terrified to have an HSG and other invasive exams.

I don’t want to just get pregnant on my own. I don’t want to have a third loss. I want to do everything in my power to avoid this next time. Should I go to my OBGYN and just ask for different testing? Or should I go to an RE? 

I feel like it’s all in my hands and no one is telling me what to do one way or the other. My endocrinologist was not concerned at all about my two losses, she acted like they were both a fluke because they were both so early. I don’t want to have a third to prove this isn’t a fluke.

*There should be no standalone posts about pregnancies and no mention of pregnancies outside the Weekly Results and Limbo thread*. We do this in order to keep this place a safe space for all who are dealing with the grief of a loss that is fresh.

The TTC Daily is a very supportive and welcoming place for people who are working through the grief of their loss and either waiting to try again or beginning the process of trying again. It's a good place to ask questions about TTC and the particular difficulties of TTC again after loss, it's a great place to vent about things going on in your life, it's a great place to get support when you're struggling to conceive again. It's a great home for anyone who has experienced loss that is NOT currently pregnant. Pregnant members are welcome to comment in this thread but must leave all mention of current pregnancies out of this thread.

The Weekly Results and Limbo Thread is for members to announce their results of TTC for the week (both negative and positive results). Users in early pregnancy or in pregnancy limbo may post about those things here, too.

Standalone posts are only for TTC and grief-related topics. This is a good place to link to articles or studies that may be interesting to our members, a place to post standalone rants, a place to post standalone TTC questions, and a place to give and receive support. There should be no standalone posts regarding pregnancies and no comments regarding pregnancy in this part of the sub either.

For our Alumni, those who have conceived after loss, we ask that you move to r/PregnancyAfterLoss \-- a very supportive and welcoming sub for questions about a current pregnancy and for vents and rants about pregnancy after loss. The PAL sub is also the place to celebrate any pregnancy milestones when pregnant after loss. Basically, if you are pregnant after loss, r/PregnancyAfterLoss is a great home for you. TTC members are welcome to post and comment here as well to keep up with their friends, should they choose to.

If you are referring someone here from another sub, please make sure to let them know to post any pregnancy-related topics in the PAL sub.

I know everyone here wants the same things - to end up with a baby in their arms after experiencing a loss - and we have members at many different stages of this journey. I know it isn't anyone's intent to trigger fellow members, but when the topics are so close to the heart it can and does happen.

I’ve seen a couple posts in other subs recently that make me think this - one was a vent from a husband whose wife had had a CP and he explained it along the lines of a situation when the sperm meets the egg but that’s it, never even starts to implant. Another said her dad dismissed her miscarriage because “she was never even pregnant it was just a CP”. Both of these descriptions are dismissive and so hurtful but they also scream ignorance. I just don’t like the term at all. </p>

<p>Does anyone else just refer to it as an early loss or an early miscarriage?</p>

I don't have high androgens (my testosterone is 35) and I'm very thin (110, 5'6""), but I had about 20 follicles on each ovary and no periods, so I got the diagnosis. I was very depressed at the time of the diagnosis due to the miscarriage and not getting pregnant again - I struggled emotionally for a long time.

After a round of clomid that ended up with me ovulating while my husband was out of town, I got frustrated and just decided to take a break and try to get back to ""normal"" emotionally before diving into any treatments again. I had also been taking Ovasitol, Berberine, Vitamin D, Vitamin C, Prenatals, NAC, a probiotic, cinnamon, chromium and a whole host of other supplements... I just felt defeated and stepped away.

Then, in September, I started taking black cohosh the first 8 days of my period. I had a 29 day cycle in September, a 34 day cycle in October and a 31 day cycle in November. I am in awe of my body and I can't believe this is happening. I got a blood test done at a ""self order"" laboratory facility 7 days after I thought I ovulated in November and had progesterone over 10...

So does this mean that I am really ovulating?? It has been 3 months and I haven't gotten pregnant, so maybe not... but maybe I am? Did black cohosh save me?

Also, a friend of mine said maybe i should try to NOT take black cohosh and see if my body will have a cycle on its own without it... but I don't think I want to lose a month of trying if I don't ovulate without it. Any thoughts??

I don't know how this is happening for me. I feel really lucky, but also really scared. Could this be real? Could I be able to get pregnant on my own again?

&#x200B;

As other background, prior to my miscarriage I had two elective abort!ons when I was younger. I'm not proud, but I say this to mean that I've gotten pregnant 3x in my life now. But the last year was filled with a miscarriage at 12 weeks followed by 10 months of not getting a period and not getting pregnant again... I'm lost and don't know what to think.

I’m barely sleeping, overweight from the weight I gained while pregnant (plus the stress and hormones don’t help) and overall feeling more depressed than I ever have. It’s been a huge huge challenge and I guess I’m venting in what I know is a safe space.</p>

In my case, it’s pregnancy tests. Getting my preventative cerclage placed is time-sensitive. I didn’t find out I was pregnant with Terry until I was 7 weeks. I have to know right away, and I feel like I need to know before I even miss my period.
