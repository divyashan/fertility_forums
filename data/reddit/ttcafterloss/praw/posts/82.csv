Last week when I called to schedule the tests, I told them that I had ovulated according to OPK on Wednesday the 18th, making yesterday CD21 (if you can call it that since my cycle actually started with a MC), and would they please test my progesterone bc I'm fairly certain I have low-progesterone, just in general?

The question is in this paragraph. I have environmental allergies (a lot of them -- my allergist calls me the Queen of Allergies), I'm getting immunotherapy for them, and I also have asthma, which is medicated.

Are these things specific to people with inflammatory auto-immune disorders like allergies/asthma?

EDIT (uhh to the vent part): A new test result showed up unannounced in my email this afternoon.

4,2048,confidence,<praw.reddit.Reddit object at 0x7f12a630cd90>,,ttcafterloss,"Hi All-

Just joining reddit/this thread after my husband's encouragement. I'm 32 (almost 33) and my husband is 35. I miscarried my 1st pregnancy in November of last year at 10 weeks. I've been wanting to become a part of a community and seek some support/people who have had similar experiences, but I haven't known where to start or haven't had to heart to put myself out there until now. I had a pretty disappointing visit with an OB a few weeks ago I'm feeling lost. Hoping some others will be able to share their personal experiences, offer some advice, or I guess just give me a place to get my feelings out there. It's on the long side (apologies) but here goes...

At the time of my pregnancy, my blood pressure was a bit high and I was/am morbidly obese. I was medicated for the high blood pressure and have continued on that same medication (as it is pregnancy friendly) and my bp is fairly well managed now, I have continued all my prenatal vitamins, including a very high dose of folic acid (5mg) prescribed by my physician- she said this can help prevent future miscarriages.

I had weight loss surgery (lapband) 9 years ago and have gained about 100 lbs since then. At the time I became pregnant, my lapband was currently emptied due to some issues I had been experiencing. After the miscarriage, I decided I wanted to give it another shot and see if it could help me get my weight under control. Over months, I got adjustments and was able to stop gaining weight. I even dropped down a bit, and hover between 20-25 lbs lower. 

My husband and I agreed to try to focus on getting healthier before trying to get pregnant again, but had put a deadline on it- August- at which we would consider moving forward no matter what. The reason for this is that when we got married 4 years ago (and I 60 lbs lighter) we held off on kids in the hopes we’d get healthier. I only gained more weight and am now in a worse position than I would’ve been had we done it 4 years ago, and we didn’t want to end up in the same situation- waiting and it only getting worse.

So, we decided to go for it in August. Afterall, I have lost weight (albeit at a much slower pace thatn I hoped) and have started to incorporate light exercise in (I have some knee problems that make this a bit difficult, but im working at it!). No dice.

In the meantime, I’ve been beating myself up for not doing better than I have, which has only made me more depressed. I have emotional eating issues tied to childhood trauma and have been going to therapy for a few months now (I've long since worked through the trauma, but not the emotional eating part). I desperately want to be a mom but am so discouraged with how little progress I have made. I also am worried about my health during pregnancy and of course my baby’s- and have felt selfish and like a crappy mom to start to even consider moving forward without being in perfect health. I’m stuck between not wanting to prolong or deny myself this incredible life experience and whether I even deserve to have it given everything. Since losing my baby I have realized how important being a parent is to me and life just feels empty without it. It’s been a rough few months to say the least.

My husband and I decided to make an appt with an OB to talk about all of this further. I wanted to know if there are other things I can do to help my chances of having a successful pregnancy (in addition to what im already working on), but honestly- I also just really wanted to know HOW scared I should be about getting pregnant at my size and if I really need to lose so much weight to become healthy enough to progress. The doctor essentially told me that while she has delivered healthy babies for women my size, what I need to do is take a year and lose 100 lbs. She picked this number, she said, as it is what I gained since my weight loss surgery 9 years ago.

I’ve felt really crushed since then. First, the 100 lbs seemed sort of arbitrary. Adding another year (which is what this will take, at minimum) is so hard when I’ve already waited and I’m getting older, I’m about to turn 33. I know the doctor isn’t wrong that this is the best thing I could do and I am certain this would make a world of difference for me, but it has had me so depressed and feeling like what I want is so far out of reach. So many people around me are having babies like it’s nothing and I just get so angry with myself that I’m even in this position. I’ve gotten horribly depressed, particularly because I can’t even be sure *how long* it will take me to get there.

I guess I’m not 100% sure what I am looking for anyone to say. But I’m hurting, scared, frustrated, and I feel really stuck. Has anyone ever been in these shoes before? Do you have any advice to make this feel more manageable?

I'm on my first cycle TTC after taking a break following two early losses.

Going forward I was thinking about not testing, but stopping alcohol and not eating food that is unsafe during pregnancy from 7DPO until I either get my period or am so late that I must be pregnant. I thought not testing might help me manage my anxiety.

I didn't want to turn another year older without having any kids. This was supposed to be the year I gave birth to my first baby. We started trying to concieve in April 19 and very quickly fell pregnant with our little Nugget. I was over the moon and I might have jumped the gun a little bit on telling friends and family. Right before a big move across the country, I went in for a 13 wk checkup and they couldn't find a heartbeat. We were so devestated. I had my D&C about a week later in July 19 and we finished our move to our new home.

Since we've gotten here I've hated it. I put all of Nugget's things in a closet. I closed off the door to the room that was supposed to be his. I've avoided meeting new coworkers and friends because I thought I was going to get to do that all with a baby. I've also been trying to find the perfect thing to remember my little Nugget by. I bought a nice house plant and put it right by my bed. I've thought about getting a necklace with his birthstone or some sort of statue or something but nothing seemed too right.

So this weekend my DH took me out for a small night of relaxing and while we sat down for drinks he handed me an envelope. And inside was a certificate with a star in the sky that he dedicated to our baby. Through my ugly tears and sobbing, we found where it was on a map and went outside to see if we could spot it. It was a little too cloudy to see it-but that didn't matter. He had bought you a star. I have ALWAYS loved space and everything having to do with it and now in someway, my baby was apart of that too. I can walk outside any night now and look up and find my baby. 

I don't think I'll ever get another gift quite as special as that. It still hurts so much to think about my little nugget and I know it will continue to hurt for a long time. But it's gotten easier. And I'm so glad I found that perfect thing to remember him by.

If you are having a bad day I am so sorry, you are welcome to rant and rave in a comment and I will listen. I don&#39;t participate much but this sub has been incredibly helpful to me. I want you to know you are not alone, and if you need someone to listen we are here, we hear you. Our situations may not be the same and I am sorry you are here, but you are not alone. Much love.</p>

We went in for our 20 week scan on Friday excepting everything to be ok only to be given the devastating news our baby has a serious birth defect. Of course being a Friday all the doctors had gone home so we had to wait until today to get more tests done, that was the longest weekend of my life.

We had more scans today and counselling and have made the hard decision to say goodbye to our baby. I can't face the idea of them being born to suffer through so much intervention and an operation to maybe not even survive. Not to mention the long term health concerns they are likely to have. 

I have a 3 year old to think about as well and I don't want her to go through the loss of the baby, her bonding with it only to lose them later would be so upsetting. I have to think about what's best for all of us and I think this is the best way for our family.

I have to go in on Wednesday to start the whole process. It's like being on death row. I feel like I'm counting down the minutes until our appointment. I've organised my Mum to help with my daughter, she loves Nannie, and she's going to have her as much as she can. I also have a lovely friend who will come over and help in any way she can. She's going to take my daughter out later in the week for a playdate which she will love.

I'm just feeling so lost. It's like everything has come crashing down around us in such a short space of time.

I’m new here, so I thought I’d make an intro post. As the title indicates, I had a TFMR at 21 weeks last week. It feels like it’s been 100 years in the meantime. Here’s a bit of background - I’m 30 and my husband is 29. We started TTC in April 2018 and I found out I was pregnant in May 2019 after going through fertility testing and two IUIs. We never really got a chance to be happy and excited about the pregnancy, because every step of the way doctors were telling us that there were concerns about the viability. At 12 weeks I learned that I had very low amniotic fluid and was closely monitored until 20 weeks to see if the baby’s kidneys would be able to produce his own fluid. The main concern was about lung development and kidney functionality. In the end, several doctors determined that our son would have less than 10% chance of surviving birth, and we chose to TFMR. 

This has been the most excruciating process I’ve ever gone through, starting with the anxiety of TTC through fertility treatment and the agony of this diagnosis and new reality we are facing. We”re lucky to have very supportive family and friends, though I’ve realized I need to be very prescriptive in asking for what I want and need from them. This process scares people into thinking they should give us space, when we need love and support. There are still a few people who knew about the pregnancy that I need to tell, but I’m scared. I am taking one more week off before going back to work, so trying to find some peace in the meantime before then.

We found out that I was pregnant several weeks ago and it was a bit earlier than anticipated but we were excited. We have always wanted 3 or 4 kids. 

I’ve gone through the same old morning sickness and nausea and all that, had a dating scan at 8 weeks which was awesome and then had no real worries going into my 12 week scan. I saw baby moving around all over and it was amazing. Honestly it was the most active baby I’ve seen from any of my children on the ultrasound screen. 

But then a day later my midwife called me and said a couple things popped up on the scan that worried them. One, my baby has an SUA (two vessel umbilical cord), which seen in isolation isn’t necessarily an issue. But the baby also seems to have a heart problem. The radiographer just wrote ‘a wave missing’. I’m guessing that means A Wave but we aren’t sure. The midwife said she can’t tell me what’s wrong but that in her experience these two things together are a chromosomal abnormality indicator or serious heart defects. There’s always the chance that that isn’t the case but the midwife wasn’t super hopeful and the literature on this isn’t promising either. 

The midwife has referred me to a prenatal specialist for a level 2 ultrasound and echocardiogram on October 1. I’ll be 14w6d. I am terrified and praying every day that things don’t look as terrible as we think they might be. But we will find out then, and my bloodwork will also be in by then too. 

Anyways, my husband and I have talked and decided that if we receive bad news and the prognosis is incompatible with life or poor quality of life that we will terminate. 

My heart feels sad and angry and broken and I am so upset and angry about being in this position. But here we are. I’m trying hard to stay distracted and not lose hope. But I also want to be prepared for what may come. 

So, those that TFMR in the second tri, could you share your experience? I will be 15 weeks if it happens (I am going to book the procedure at a clinic now so that I don’t have to wait longer if the news is bad). 

I think one clinic doesn’t do Laminaria insertion if you’re before 16 weeks and then the other clinic does it regardless when you’re 14-18. So that’s a difference between a one or two day procedure. Is one better than the other? 

I’m already scared of the D and E, especially of excessive bleeding as I had a PPH with my second birth. I don’t have any bleeding disorders though and have had a D and C before with no bleeding complications.  My PPH was also controlled as soon as they gave me oxytocin. 

Anyways, any encouraging or kind words about the procedure would be helpful.

I started trying pretty early, I was 19, engaged and I've known I've wanted to be a mom since I very young. 

We married in 2016 I was 20 he was 23. He already had a son that we didn't see much (that's another story) I really wanted one of my own and to give him a child he could actually be a dad to. Unfortunately the marriage didn't last long. We divorced May 2018. In a sad way, I was glad we didn't conceive. 

I was convinced that it just wasn't gonna happen for me. I tried for a little over 3 years without a single positive test. 

A few months after my divorce I started seeing someone new. Didn't intend to fall in love with someone so quickly, but shit happens. I didn't think I could get pregnant, so we weren't being very careful. 

January 2019 (I'm 22 at this time) my period is 2 days late (I'm super regular, I start on my predicted day almost every time) I take a test, it was faint, but it was positive. I didn't believe it. Was it actually happening? Next day another positive. Health department, yup positive. Predidiced about 4 weeks along, estimated due date October 2nd.

I was terrified, but so very excited. My boyfriend (31) was also excited, we both want a family someday. 

That excitement lasted exactly one week. I bled enough to fill a pad and started having very sharp pains on my right side. 

Emergency room said it was ectopic. Gave me a shot of metho-something to end the pregnancy and sent me on my way. This was my first day of vacation with my bf and we had planned to announce the news to my parents. Instead I got to call my mom with sad news. 

It gets worse

2 weeks later on February 14th, the pain in my right side is UNBEARABLE. Back to the ER. Doctor tells me my baby is still alive and my tube is about to burst. (I was 7 weeks) I had to have emergency surgery. I had to deal with losing this same baby twice. They had to remove my right tube because it was too damaged. Damn thing was a fighter, and I had to cut it out. 

Neither of us are necessarily ""ready"" for a baby, but it's something we both realised we want together. 

I'm 23 now and I do my best to not think about it or stress about why I'm not conceiving.  I have my days tho.

Today was the one that made me finally share my story publicly. I woke up just cranky as all hell. Boyfriend told me not to worry about the laundry and go get my nails done (been needing a fill) it normally relxes me and puts me in a better mood. However when I get there, there's an older woman with her very pregnant daughter talking about how she's getting induced October 2nd. It hit me all over again. That was my original due date. I should be ready to have my baby any day now. So I'm wiping away tears trying not to break down in the salon.

I try not to be bitter, but damnit it just isn't fair.

Now I'm afraid it wont happen again. I have endo and only one tube.

I had a miscarriage earlier this month at 8 weeks. I tested this morning with FMU and I had the faintest of lines. Only seen with natural lighting but it was absolutely there. How close do you think I am to testing negative? I have stopped bleeding and have had a lot of EWCM the past couple days so I had assumed I might be ovulating. I was pretty surprised to see a line. Any experiences on how soon your cycles started once you had a faint line?

My history:

8/30: 10,700 HCG

9/4: Ultrasound showed healthy embryo, I'm sure my HCG had risen from the week before.

9/5: Miscarriage, passed gestational sac.

9/7: 1,900 HCG

9/13: D&C for residual products. Doctor said it was a ""very light scraping"", not much left.

9/22: Faint line

&#x200B;

Seeing this all laid out, I now realize that not much time has passed. So strange how 3 weeks can feel like 3 months.

Edit: Negative test the next day with FMU, yay! 18 days after my miscarriage. No period yet.

I mainly just want to share our story since so many of you have shared yours. Hopefully I will be able to post a ""happy ending"" story one day. 

 In 2016 we got pregnant with our third child and lost the pregnancy at 12 weeks. A few months later we got pregnant again with a baby girl. After a perfect 3-d ultrasound at 20 weeks (with our kids, for a fun gender reveal), we show up to our anatomy scan a week later completely unprepared for them to tell us she now had no heartbeat. We went through the trauma of delivering her and did all of the tests possible only to be told everything was normal. Over the next couple years we went on to lose two more babies, 12 and 16 weeks. All perfect genetics, perfect growth, no problems until suddenly they were just gone. We've had a bunch of tests, tried blood thinner even though I don't have any indications of a blood clotting problem, and nothing has worked. 

Most people think we should just give up because we do have two healthy children. Their attitude is that we should be happy with what we have. Of course I am grateful for what I have but it doesn't change what has been taken from me. And it feels like this will have all been for nothing if we stop. Recurrent pregnancy loss feels like a unique kind of hell that no one talks about and you are not supposed to talk about, except for groups like this you are supposed to just pretend that life is normal and everything is fine. 

 I previously believed that prayer could really make a difference but have now lost my faith on top of everything else. We have been on so many prayer lists with our last 2 pregnancies and it never made any difference. So now we are giving up...sort of... I am giving up on the idea of ever being pregnant again, ever getting to feel my baby kick again, but this week we are moving forward with starting IVF for developing embryos to use with a surrogate. Through an independent matching group on Facebook we have found a potential surrogate that lives relatively close to us. Our egg retrieval date is scheduled to be right about the time when we should be welcoming our baby, our 4th pregnancy loss at 16 weeks.

 I have so many mixed emotions about this whole process and if we are making the right decision, if this is too much of a financial burden on our family, etc. but in the end I think if we don't try I will regret it. Regardless of everything my desire for another child is still the same as it has always been. It still feels like someone in our family is missing, and like our family is not yet complete. This journey has changed almost everything about me but I still have hope. We have decided not to tell our family and most of our friends about the surrogacy journey because we know we will get a lot of unsolicited advice and people telling us we should be happy and move on. 

I know everyone here has some really hard stories to share, if anyone has gone through a situation with surrogacy or is considering it, it would be great to hear from you. It has been helpful reading many of your stories and questions as we have gone throughout the past few months deciding what to do and how to move forward.

I went for my scheduled appointment at 10 weeks only to find that the baby only measured 6 weeks. Obviously pretty devastated, I waited a week to be checked again for any growth. There was none and there was no heartbeat detected, the miscarriage was confirmed. Honestly, I had prepared myself for this, as nothing about this pregnancy felt right, even down to the positive pregnancy test. I opted for medical management of this and used the pills. This did as I expected, I presumed, as the typical symptoms were there.  I resumed life. My birthday rolled around a week later. I was still bleeding but I was told this was normal. I went to test drive a car in preparation for buying one, because, why not!? As I was sitting in the Salesman's seat, I felt weird and went straight to the bathroom. I found that I was bleeding profusely and had bled through my pad, underwear, and pants. I quickly replaced the pad only to notice that, somehow, I had also bled all over my leg, my arm, and the bathroom floor. The dealership bathroom looked like a crime scene. I cleaned it up, excused myself from the meeting with the dealer, and called the doctor on my way home. They said to take Ibuprofen, lay down, and if it didn't get better, to head to the emergency room, as I could be dealing with a life threatening situation, and to keep my scheduled 12 week appointment in 2 days. I did this and things improved.  I gave up on my birthday at this point and went to bed early.

I went to my appointment where they did an ultrasound only to find that there was still some tissue left. They gave me the option of another round of medication, a manual evacuation, or a D & C. I chose the least invasive manual evacuation since the medication did not work. The doctor prepped me and it began. It was uncomfortable but I distracted myself through it. The doctor said he got some tissue out and would be sending it to the lab. The nurse and doctor stepped out to let me rest for a second and wait for any residual bleeding to stop. The nurse was to return after placing the samples in the lab. After they left, I felt a massive gush. It did not stop. Then I heard the splashing on the floor. It wasn't stopping. There was no call light and my phone was not within reach. Just before I was about to call out for help, the nurse walked in. I quickly joked that I thought there was a murder scene going on but I could not see it. Her eyes got big and she said ""yeah, there is"" and she called for the doctor. She went straight to changing the pads under me 3 at a time. The doctor came in an stated that he had never had this happen and quickly listed my options.  I chose for him to do the same manual evacuation one more time before I went to the emergency room  to see if the bleeding would stop before I would need a transfusion. He yelled for everything to be ready and stated it would have to happen NOW or I would be heading to the emergency room. He did it, the bleeding slowed, and I refused a transfusion. It took a total of 3 1/2 hours before I could leave the office. By this time my husband had arrived, who I had informed what was going on after I started hemorrhaging. 

Fast forward a few weeks, the bleeding had slowed and pretty much stopped. Then, at work, I suddenly felt as if I had peed myself and went to the bathroom only to find my underwear and pants blood soaked. When I used the toilet, a massive clot came out.  I shoved toilet paper in my pant to go grab a pad, put the pad in, and ran to the closest store I could find everything I needed, as it would be closer than my house. I grabbed underwear, pants, pads, and wipes and used the store bathroom to make myself decent. I then drove back to work and called my boss to explain (I had already filled him in). He tells me to go home. I call my doctor to explain and they get me in for an emergency appointment the same day. They check and see a mass. it is unknown but believed to be a massive clot. The doctor is unsure and the ultrasound tech is unsure. I was then scheduled for a D&C the next day. 

I had the procedure, it is still unknown what the mass was but still believed to be a clot, and 4 weeks later I am just not beginning to feel normal with no bleeding. I am ready to move on but the fear of all this happening again has me going into panic attacks. My husband is supportive but obviously concerned and slightly frustrated due to not understanding what I have been going through the past 2 months. He is great about listening and giving me the space I need but I don't want to be stuck with this fear forever. It has only been a few days since things have been normal and the last time this happened all hell broke loose so I am terrified of what is to come.

I'd like to introduce myself a little. I'm (as of 9/22) 24 and have been on my TTC journey with my DH(25) since May this year (2019). 

On Sept. 10th we got our BFP and was very excited and after having it confirmed at the clinic we told our family. All of which were so excited. We all celebrated etc. 

*Trigger warning ahead!*

Well on Sept 16th after applying for the insurance and touring the birthing center I was really interested in I started getting so hot and started spotting. I panicked because I just kinda felt off. But after the week before I got my BFP it kinda seemed like my symptoms kinda slowly disappearing and I had cramps on my right side the entire time. I honestly think my baby passed by the 4th or 5th week. 

Anyways I called my doctor she did a HCG test and a gentle pelvic exam told me my cervix was closed but I was spotting. She told me go to the ER if it gets worse. So I tried putting it all behind me and going it's fine its fine...  had a okay night and the next morning it was a literal bloody nightmare. I went to the ER... which was not fun my veins are tiny and I was in such a state of shock I forgot my name... 

They told me I indeed was having a miscarriage. Told me go home let it pass naturally follow up in two days for blood work HCG and an ultrasound. 

So on the 16th my HCg was 20. The 17th it was 12. The 19th it was 3. My uterus is empty and normal size again. The bleeding is slowed down alot as well and I feel like i did pre-pregnancy. 
I am very heartbroken and my husband is too. My whole family has cried with us. I will always love this baby. 
But I am trying to look toward the future to help me in my grief and I'm not gunna stop trying yet.

So my doctor said she wants me to wait 3 months before started TTC again for my body to heal. I am slightly annoyed with that answer I'll admit. But ladies how long did you take before starting TTC again? Did you doctor tell you to wait? Did you listen?

Looking for advice on thyroid tests from anyone who has experience.

I unfortunately miscarried last week at 8 weeks (growth had stopped at ~6 weeks). Even beforehand I had been concerned about some symptoms (e.g.those listed here http://www.thyroiduk.org/tuk/about_the_thyroid/hypothyroidism_signs_symptoms.html) and had suspected thyroid issues but was told not to worry by doctors, but given the loss I want to be completely sure there's no underlying issue to blame. 

I had a TSH test done and apparently the results are 'normal' but that's all the info I've been given. I wonder whether I should pursue further?

*Symptoms*
- Hair loss. Around the day of implantation I ran my hands through my hair and had handfuls fall out. In the eight weeks since I've still been shedding consistently every day, significantly more than ever before.
- Anxiety and depression. Always struggled with this, increasingly since coming off meds before TTC.
- Sensitivity to cold
- Dry skin inc eczema and psoriasis
- Weight fluctuation
- Brittle nails
- Breathlessness (history of asthma)
- Post nasal drip


- Are there other tests I should ask for?
- Could getting my TSH levels checked only four days after d&c affect the results?
- So many of these symptoms can be explained by something else (e.g. normal preg hormones). Do these even sound like valid reasons to pursue tests?

I started getting ovarian cysts at 13, my first being the size of a baseball on my left ovary. Therefore I’ve been on birth control since a very young age. I’ve also been told I have a slightly septated and a slightly tilted uterus, but that it shouldn’t cause me many problems. 

Back track to two and a half years ago, I get of birth control and my acne begins taking over my entire chin. Cystic, painful, and really not pleasant to look at and I gained about 10lbs. Hubby and I tried tracking ovulation with the clear blue advanced tests and I always got high fertility but never peak.

We were so excited and I was feeling pretty great. Had my first U/S at what the doctor said was 5 weeks, 3 days, doctor only saw yolk sac then. She said it was absolutely normal but I was concerned because I thought I should be further along. Had a follow up two weeks later, the fetus was only measuring 6 weeks, 3 days and the heartbeat was 99. Doctor also saw something that they said could’ve been a polyp or a bleed next to the gestational sac, didn’t know. Doc put me on progesterone right away but gave us a 20% chance of the pregnancy being successful. Two days later, I went for a follow up/second opinion with another doctor who couldn’t find a heartbeat at all , said maybe it’s early, come back in a week. He said the thing outside the sac looked like a polyp. Well I had the week follow up this past Monday and no growth or change to the fetus, no heartbeat detected. Said there is a large hematoma outside the sac, guess it wasn’t a polyp after all. He said it could be what caused the fetal demise or it could be a sign of impending miscarriage, didn’t know or clarify. I’ve had no bleeding or spotting at all, by the way. They scheduled me for a d&c tomorrow.   

Aside from being devastated by the situation, I am also terrified. We want to ttc as soon as possible after this is all over, but I’m so scared. What if the d&c causes scarring? I’m terrified of taking a pill and dealing with all that coming out at home too, though. Also, What if we try again and I keep getting these Hematomas ?

So, I’m K. I’m 28 and my husband and I lost our first pregnancy to a MMC in August. I was around 11weeks but measuring 6w1d. I tried and failed misoprostol and had a D&C last week. The D&C was hard, because I felt like I had processed a lot of my grief, and then it came back when I found out the misoprostol failed. So now I feel like I’m at square one while at the same time finally done with the physical part. 

More than anything, I’m desperate to start trying again. As much as I want my body to feel “normal” again, I want to be pregnant again even more. I know the baby I lost can never be replaced- and I don’t want them to be. But I am frustrated with the waiting to try- the 3 weeks between the misoprostol and the D&C and now the 4-6 weeks for my body to have a cycle. I also might have PCOS and I plan to fight for as much testing as I can get to confirm that diagnosis and treat it.

I was a nervous wreck during my last pregnancy every time I had a beta draw (and that was despite knowing that I'd get my results only 3-4 hours afterward) or an ultrasound. I actually cancelled an appointment to have an additional scan at 9+3 (after scans at 6+1, 7+1, and 8+4 were all normal) because I knew that I would be anxious about the result and if one little thing were off (e.g., baby measuring an extra day behind, etc), I would obsess over it. Plus, I had hyperemesis, and that gave me a built-in sense of reassurance that everything was progressing normally.

I walked into my NT scan nauseous, weak, and dehydrated, only to find out that my baby's heart had stopped about a week earlier. Going forward, I know now that having hyperemesis isn't a reliable indicator (at least for me) that everything is okay, and it's causing me to re-think my attitude toward early monitoring -- primarily so that I don't end up suffering needlessly, sacrificing my time with my family and my reputation at work, for nothing.

I just had my CD3 hormone testing as ordered by my OBGYN this morning and my first test result came in - the doctor hasn't commented yet, but I can't help analyzing...the downside of getting results online...

My TSH Reflex this morning was 3.190 - within the range of 0.450 - 4.500 ""Standard Range"" but I think the optimal level when trying to conceive is <2.5

Ten days after my confirmed MMC in April my TSH was 2.330 and my OBGYN commented that it was normal and not the reason for the loss. In August I had a regular appointment with my endocrinologist (not an RE) that I’ve been seeing for my hyperprolactinemia for years – he was the one that first told me about the 2.5 threshold. He said that my TSH in April was in the grey area at 2.3 and  treating it could help (or at least not hurt) my trying to get pregnant. Since I was in that “grey area” he tested again and in August my TSH was 1.900 – said it looked great and that I didn’t need medication. I was happy that it was normal but also kinda had my hopes up that was what was wrong with me and my OBGYN didn’t know better (I understand she can’t be a specialist on everything).

Now it’s up again and I’m hoping my OBGYN thinks it is higher than it should be…though I’m not holding my breath, I’ve had to push her for all the testing I’ve received and am waiting to see someone new. If she doesn’t see it as a potential issue, I’m not sure what to do – I could contact my endocrinologist otherwise wait for my appt on Oct 8th with a reproductive specialist (her specialty is listed as Endocrinology, OBGYN, Reproductive Medicine). I just don’t want to potentially waste a cycle here…

I’m sure I’m over-analyzing and worrying about this too much – has anyone had their TSH levels fluctuate like this?

If she doesn’t see it as a potential issue, I’m not sure what to do – I could contact my endocrinologist otherwise wait for my appt on Oct 8th with a reproductive specialist (her specialty is listed as Endocrinology, OBGYN, Reproductive Medicine). I just don’t want to potentially waste a cycle here…</p>

<p>I’m sure I’m over-analyzing and worrying about this too much – has anyone had their TSH levels fluctuate like this? Or been treated if your level was under 4.5 but over 2.5?</p>

I'm 32, live in Virginia, work in communications, and have been married for almost 8 years. I like playing music, gardening, anything to do with design, cooking and baking, reading fantasy and science fiction, and acquiring new skills. LC arrived in 2015 with no real issues, and my husband and I have been TTC#2 since Mar 2018 (18 months).

Here's what has happened so far:

I conceived in Sept 2018. Diagnosed with an ectopic pregnancy in my right tube, which was medically managed with two doses of methotrexate between weeks 7 and 8.

I conceived again in Feb 2019 and then had an incomplete MC at 8 weeks. Two separate doses of misoprostol didn't work to finish the process, although I--not exaggerating--nearly fainted reading about what it was supposed to do to me (got about 90% of the way to fainting, realized what was happening, and sat down under my desk until the whooshing sound dissipated and the lights came back on). Finally, doctor performed a manual aspiration.

I had a chemical pregnancy at 4 weeks in June, which was not confirmed by a doctor, only by home tests. Basically I got a positive test 11DPO, another 12DPO, then a negative 13DPO and got my period the next day.

Then, I had another chemical pregnancy at 5 weeks this past Saturday, which was confirmed by my doc. That one is still ongoing.

I apparently don't have a problem conceiving, I just can't hang on to them. 

Still, I'm not willing to give up, and my doc has finally agreed to start doing tests on me. My hunch, based on my other diagnosed medical issues (ADHD, allergies, asthma, and fibrocystic breast changes), is that I have low-progesterone.

I hope that this is the place for me, and that I can find some kindred spirits here.

This is my first post here. A little background information I had a missed MC in late July after several weeks of rocky early pregnancy (bleeding, slow heart rate etc). I had a d/c on 8/23. This was my first pregnancy. I’m 29. 

I had my post op appointment with my OB yesterday. She recommended we do some testing (saline injection sonogram to look at the shape of my uterus) and that I start baby aspirin and vaginal progesterone with any further pregnancies. She did tell me during our first meeting that she’s very conservative but these recommendations caught me off guard. Maybe I’m just living with my head in the clouds but I was expecting no change/intervention after one loss at <30 years old. I asked her if there was anything in particular that concerned her to want to do testing and she said no.

Did anyone else experience this/ get these recommendations?

She also suggested we wait three cycles to try to conceive again and I really don’t want to 😬

For me, since I started tracking and trying back in 2016, once I got my body to ovulate that is, I always had sensitive nipples around the time of ovulation.  Looking back at my charts, it seems to have varied in number of days and sometimes started on ovulation day and then a few days past, or other times a few days before ovulation through a few days after.  I had grown accustomed to it being my telltale sign which was helpful as I have mild PCOS and can sometimes have EWCM present multiple times before actual ovulation.

TW, LC mentioned:

After #1 was born, I didn't get my period back until 11months PP, and I continued to breastfeed until 18months (weaned at about 8w pregnant with the miscarried pregnancy) but the sensitive nipples were still present on the first few cycles I had PP, up until the cycle I got pregnant and then miscarried.  That cycle was weird, I couldn't tell if I was actually going to ovulate, any sensitivity I had was only noticed in the shower but no other times.  I also for the first time had a really short LH surge and never saw a positive OPK as it must have happened overnight.  Then, this first post-MC cycle was similar, except not even the slightest maybe-they're-sensitive-maybe-they're-not feeling, and again a really fast LH surge that most likely happened overnight.  

I know ovulation symptoms can be different cycle to cycle, but it feels weird to me.  Not that I want my nipples to hurt but it makes me feel like something is off.  I thought maybe low progesterone/weak ovulation, but my progesterone at approx 7/8dpo this past cycle was 18.1, so that's not too bad, and my LP was 13 days.  Should I push to have hormone testing in the follicular phase/CD3 labs to see what estrogen is doing pre-ovulation?  Don't worry about it?

It was a MMC, I was around 10 weeks but baby was only measuring 8w1d.  I had an early US at 7w5d (based on ovulation, not LMP) and baby was behind at 6w6d, had an enlarged yolk sac, but had a HR of 127.  I was on progesterone supplements at 14dpo, levels went down despite 200mg vaginal suppositories, and subsequently started injections in addition.  My second/last US was after only 3 shots so I don't know if they were effective in raising progesterone levels any, but it wouldn't have mattered as the pregnancy was obviously not viable. I requested the second US because of my concerns about slow growth and the size of the YS, combined with the low-ish progesterone and I'm glad I did, otherwise I would have waited till 12 weeks or till I started miscarrying on my own.  After we got the news that the baby no longer had a HB, I stopped the progesterone and started bleeding roughly a week later.  I still had retained tissue a week after that despite slowed bleeding, so I did a round of Cytotec.  Still had retained tissue two weeks later so I had a D&C finally to remove the rest as it appeared stuck in my cervix/lower uterus.  HPTs were negative less than 48 hours after the procedure but I continued to bleed for another 5 or 6 days.  I ovulated sometime around 8/26, and am now on CD3 of my first post-MC cycle.  

A little more about me, I have Hashimoto's Hypothyroidism, suspected PCOS, long and irregular cycles, and MTHFR mutation.  I have one LC (12/2017), and struggled for 12 months before getting pregnant the first time.  I am medicated for my thyroid and levels currently are looking pretty good (post MC).  I have not had any CD3 labs done recently.  I also take a slew of vitamins: Prenatal with folate, Vit D, Vit C, Vit E, Omega-3, Ubiquinol, Ovasitol, and a Probiotic.

I just started temping again and am curious to see how this first cycle goes since I have a history of such long and weird cycles.

After the first one I had to go on antidepressants but went off after the second pregnancy (that ended as a CP). I dont want to do it again, but I dont know. This is so hard.</p>

The pregnancy had stopped progressing at 9 weeks. Naturally, I’ve spent the last month going back trying to figure out what went wrong. We had previously seen a healthy, beating heart at 7 weeks. 

There is one big thing that is really bugging me. At 9 weeks my midwife found I had extremely High blood pressure (I’ve never had any known blood pressure problems before). She sent me to my GP and he was sure that the reason for my blood pressure was the fact that I was covered, head to toe in eczema (a condition I’ve battled with since I was a baby). 

We got the rash under control and my BP was back down within the week...in hindsight, the lower blood pressure could have been a result of the fact that the baby had died. 

Now...I have just had my first period since the loss, and we are ready to start trying again. I went back to my doctor today and he now thinks (although won’t definitely say) that my High blood pressure may have caused the MMC.  The fact that my blood pressure was still high today (150/90) indicates that I may have underlying hypertension, which would have been exacerbated by the pregnancy....alternative theory is that I’m just ridiculously anxious...

After my last loss, I sought therapy and threw myself into my career. I excelled in a heavily male dominated tech workplace and am now a manager of a department. There’s some talk of me moving up again. While all this is great and helped me reclaim confidence after my losses, whenever talk of my role comes up I get the pang of anxiety that if I conceive again, I will be extremely ill and it will be noticeable immediately. My last two losses are widely known because I made it into the second trimester and was sick so early, I had to come clean and take sick leave. I find myself feeling panicked - on top of worries of another miscarriage, health complications, I now have a career that might take a beating. Most of the men I work with are kind, but I was and will mostly still be the first female in my workplace to get pregnant (again). We are a startup company with no solid HR department. I have to go directly to the CEO with any HR related stuff. 

I’m sure a lot of this feeling stems from feeling incredibly vulnerable and embarrassed after my losses but any words of wisdom would really help me with perspective here. I am 32, have one ovary and severe endometriosis. I know time is limited - but I’m having a rough time kicking all this anxiety to the curb.",t2_9byrt,False,,0,False,Working up the workplace courage after loss,[],r/ttcafterloss,False,0,,0,,,False,t3_d0adou,False,dark,0.88,,public,6,0,{},,,False,[],,False,False,,{},,False,6,,False,self,1567767982.0,,[],{},,True,,1567764585.0,text,0,,,text,self.ttcafterloss,False,"<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=""md""><p>Looking for some perspective here. I had two second trimester miscarriages the last couple of years - most recently in 2017 with twin girls. I have no living children. I get a lot of complications such as pregnancy induced hyperthyroidism and hyperemesis gravidarum. Both pregnancies I was hospitalized and overall, it was a traumatic experience. I deal with the fear of miscarriage again but as well, knowing that statistically I will most likely get extremely ill again. About a 85% chance.
