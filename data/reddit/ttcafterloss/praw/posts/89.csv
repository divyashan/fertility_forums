I just wanted to introduce myself and ask for some support/coping tools. I'm 33f, first pregnancy, Hashimoto's thyroid and overweight but otherwise healthy.

My husband and I have been trying since September 2019, and conceived in January. This past week went from some of my happiest moments to some of my saddest. After the first doctor's appointment and blood test confirmed my pregnancy, I was elated. Then over the week, my HCG failed to increase and then decreased, indicating a soon-to-be miscarriage. It was bittersweet when the miscarriage started naturally on Sunday night (though was surprisingly uncomfortable, for how early the pregnancy was), because I was glad that I didn't have to wait forever for it to start.

The miscarriage was emotionally devastating, and then - I swear to God - the night I miscarried, our dog passed away in her sleep. She was old so it wasn't shocking, but still it was horrible. Because of the miscarriage I feel that I didn't really get to spend any time with her on her last night, as I was too wrapped up in my own grief and physical pain. 

To top it off, my best friend told me yesterday (the day after my miscarriage/pet loss) she was pregnant after trying once. I am of course happy for her, I love her dearly, but it sent me careening. 

I have two questions for you all. 

First, how do you keep this all from consuming your life? Trying to get pregnant, coping with the loss - I feel like the last 5 months, I've been totally focused on that and only that.  And now that we'll be trying again soon, if we conceive - I can't even imagine how uber focused and anxious I'll be.

Second, how do you all cope with friend's pregnancies? Three of my best friends are  pregnant right now (and all three after only trying a month or two), and despite feeling genuinely happy for them, I'm also bitterly envious. How do you deal?

The summary is, I've had 3 CP in a row now- they were all very early losses. I also have a history of autoimmune disease, but it's well controlled, so it's expected I have little to no associated antibodies present at this point. I plan to see my OBGYN in a couple weeks to discuss.

&#x200B;

The longer version is:

I have graves disease, an autoimmune disease that causes hyperthyroidism. I had a total thyroidectomy 1 year ago, so now I'm more similar to a hypothyroid patient than a standard graves patient. I take replacement thyroid hormone, and my levels were exactly where they needed to be to get pregnant.

**Cycle 1:** We began TTC in December 2019. On 12DPO of our first cycle, I got a positive pregnancy test and also began spotting. I tested again 13DPO- the line was lighter and I began bleeding later that day. 

I talked to my OBGYN who wasn't concerned with 1 CP and approved me to start trying again right away.

I also talked to my endocrinologist and had my thyroid levels checked. My numbers were off (TSH of about 4.8), which was expected because pregnancy changes how much thyroid hormone your body needs. While elevated TSH can be associated with pregnancy loss, my endo felt my TSH likely wasn't the cause here and said TSH's in the double digits are more likely cause a problem than a slight elevation. (Just to note, if I had stayed pregnant, we would have increased my thyroid medication immediately to get the TSH back down.)

**Cycle 2:** I had my thyroid levels checked again and they were back in the perfect range for pregnancy. My chart for this next cycle was a mess due to an illness that caused a fever and just generally wacky data. However, I did get pregnant again, though I didn't realize it right away. I started spotting around 10DPO and continued spotting through 13DPO. On 13DPO I took my first pregnancy test of the cycle and got a faint positive. I began bleeding the next day. 

**Cycle 3:** This most recent cycle, I tested early on 8DPO, and it was a faint positive. On 9DPO, the positive line was barely visible. I spotted 10DPO and 11DPO and began bleeding the next day.

&#x200B;

I've scheduled a consultation with my OBGYN . I really don't know how the conversation will go at all. I feel a little nervous she will be dismissive because all 3 losses were so super early, and many people might not even have know they were pregnant.

I got pregnant this November and miscarried my baby on December. Both me and my fiance wanted a baby for about five years now, but didn't try till this November because we wanted to make sure our finances were okay and we were in a stable state, ready to be the parents we want to be. When we got pregnant we were overjoyed. When we lost our baby we were devastated. 

About a month after our loss I learnt that an old friend was pregnant. She was ten days earlier than me. If I hadn't lost my first pregnancy we'd both have July babies. I was partly happy partly angry and hurt her pregnancy went great and mine didn't. I was healthier, fitter, weighed less, didn't smoke and didn't drink. Same with my fiance. So much healthier than her husband. Another reason I was bitter about them was that my friend had aborted a baby a few years back. She was still on college and it was the right decision for her. I in no shape or form condemn her for it. But when I was torn into a million pieces from losing my baby and learnt she'd have hers and everything went perfectly I did feel bitter. I'd never wish anything bad on her of course. Not her, not her baby. I hope she has a wonderful family and life. I still feel fucking bitter. 

Then today, two and a half months after my miscarriege, I learnt another common friend is also pregnant. She's very underweight, has autoimunes and PCOS, a very hectic and tiring work schedule and job, smokes, and her husband is very obese and a smoker too. And yet they made it with their first pregnancy and announced a couple days ago. She used to make fun of me about being very sure about how much I wanted a family and how she wouldn't have children before thirty-five and anyone who does is stupid. She's twenty nine. She got pregnant the same time I did with my lost baby. Again the ugly bitterness. 

 I feel ashamed I'm so bitter about this. But this ""why me"" thing keeps nagging my brain. I did everything the way I was supposed to. I am healthy and want this like nothing else in the world. I worked my ass off to get where I am. I am grateful for everything in my life, i swear i am.  It's just a bit hard to not let myself drown in self-pity and annoyance. I'm also a bit sensitive. I hope due to another pregnancy. Three days left before I test... 

I just want this time to work out. I want to be pregnant. I want to have a healthy fullterm pregnancy and deliver a healthy baby in nine months.

My husband and I terminated our first, very much wanted pregnancy this past September at 17 weeks following a diagnosis of Trisomy 13. Since, we’ve learned that I’m a translocation carrier for Tri13/14. Ugh. 

We saw a fertility specialist today, kind of went over our options. IVF with egg donor, IVF with pre embryo implantation biopsy or naturally trying again. 

We live in Ontario Canada, so one cycle of IVF is covered, should we choose to go in a wait list. We see our specialist again in 6 weeks to decide our course of action. The wait list... 9 MONTHS! And even if we wanted to go out of pocket, he said there’s no point because we may be looking at 6 months for a probe to be created for our biopsy. 

I guess what I’m looking for... those of you who lost their first to Tri13 or another chromosome abnormality and KNEW it could happen again - did you go on to try naturally and have a healthy baby? I just want to hear some good stories I guess. I mean, it’s 10% of Tri13 AT BIRTH (that means, no miscarriage early pregnancy at 15-22% chance). “10%? That’s low” some will say but as he said, what does 10% mean to YOU emotionally? And that’s the thing...

Conceive, do NIPT at 10 weeks and wait till 12 weeks like before for results? We wouldn’t even bother with an amnio because the NIPT is like 95% accurate for Tri13 (I cant remember the exact %age right now, so don’t quote me).

Anyways... that was very rambly. I’m sooooo confused and conflicted and frustrated but grateful for options. WE HAVE OPTIONS, whereas I know many people don’t.

Did your ovulation symptoms change after your MC? I used to always get sore nipples a for like a week but I haven’t had anything so far. I also know you can have an anovulatory cycle after, but I’m just curious of anyone else’s experience. 

Side note: I don’t use LH strips because of PCOS. I am thinking of starting to track BBT after I get my first period. Anyone recommend doing this? Would getting something more expensive like Ovusense be more worth it?

I’m wondering how long it took you to get your first cycle after your MC. I had my MC 3 weeks 1 day ago, and I’m not even sure if I’ve ovulated. I was tracking via CM/symptoms before this happened, but everything seems all wonky. Did your ovulation symptoms change after your MC? I used to always get sore nipples a for like a week but I haven’t had anything so far. I also know you can have an anovulatory cycle after, but I’m just curious of anyone else’s experience. </p>

<p>Side note: I don’t use LH strips because of PCOS. I am thinking of starting to track BBT after I get my first period. Anyone recommend doing this? Would getting something more expensive like Ovusense be more worth it?</p>

Gonna go through the timeline:

*1/2/20-found out at our 9week (9w3d) appt that we lost the baby at 6w1d.  It was a MMC and the baby was dead inside me. DNC was schedule for the following week.

*1/10/20- DNC procedure. Removed baby/pregnancy products.

*1/20/20- Vaginal ultrasound showed I still had remaining dead tissue in my uterus. Took Cytotec (Misoprostol) Rx that night to open cervix and induce cramping/contractions to pass more tissue. Seemed successful.

*1/28/20 - Repeat vag ultrasound showed yet again, I still had dead tissue in my uterus... But only half what it was at the last appt. Took repeat treatment of Cytotec Rx that night. Cramping was less severe this time and I passed less than last time I took it.

*2/10/20- Repeat vag ultrasound showed I still had remaining dead tissue in my uterus. I'm sooooo over this sh*t. WHHHYYYYYYY??? Doc explained I'm in the 5-ish percentile of women that need a SECOND surgical procedure. F'ING GREAT! WHY DO I HAVE TO BE SPECIAL THIS TIME??? 😩😭 Given another Rx for Cytotec and scheduled my hysteroscopy. This Thursday (2/13) I will take the Cytotec Rx. Friday the 14th, yes F'ING VALENTINE'S DAY, I will be put under and they will perform the hysteroscopy procedure with suction currette to remove the remaining dead tissue.



I just want the other people going out there to know my story. I had a tough time finding stories even remotely like mine and I felt like a broken freak of nature , with a dumb body that won't cooperate. I can't even seem to miscarry right.......

I spot for a while ( and mostly slimy chunks/slugs) then I stop, then I restart, them more bad news, more delays, more of dredging up the sh*t you thought you had just started getting over.........this has been the hardest thing I have ever been through. I was hoping that by now we would have been on our way to a period and the next cycle to try IUI again to get pregnant. But nope! 

Today we would have been 15w3d. It's hard not to think about that. How big would I be right now? What would my baby bump look like? Is it a boy or a girl? ...


Now we push forward (while crying about it) to the second surgical procedure and the fact that we will be moving towards a finality of all this craziness.  I'm sooooooooooo done with this loss and all the mental crap that comes with it.

I am freaking heart broken right now. I had an insurance change. I didn't realize how bad it'd fuck me over. 

I made this appointment three months ago. I was like ok that makes sense long wait for one of the best, like you go to him boom you get pregnant and he helps it stick. But unfortunately trying to save money for my husband I switched to the better plan. That entails going to a primary care manager(PCM) to get referrals for every * **single** * appointment I ever make for any doctor ever. 

I made my doctor appt. for the 25th of February. Made this back in November before the switch. I called my PCM to see her for the first time and had to wait a month to see her on Feb. 3rd a month after making this appt. to see her. She told us labs would take three days, I'd have to call and switch doctors to the doctor I want, and voila all good to go in time for the appointment. She said she'd call about when to come in for labs and we were on our way. 

Turns out we go in any day for labs and just walk in. And they take two weeks for results to come in from today. I didn't know this till two weeks after seeing her.

So not only did I just have to get a needle in my arm, I now have to wait 3 more months to just know if I can have a baby ever make it past a certain time. To top it off I'll be bringing the one of the best infertility doctors three month old lab results. They will be useless to him. 

I've never been this heartbroken over a doctors appointment but then again, I've never had to wait six months total to know something so important to me and my husband. We started trying early because I had a feeling it would be a long time till we could have kids. Four years later I was right it'll take awhile.

 I'm scared it'll never happen because I will go to this appointment get told to try this, then have to tell the doctor I'll be leaving for another state in x months. And by the time we have just one kid, I'm also scared I'll be so exhausted from just having to constantly go from doctor to doctor to doctor repeating and repeating what's going on trying to fix it, that I'll be too exhausted to enjoy finally having a baby.

My husband and I have been TTC since October 2014, and had 4 early miscarriages since. The farthest I got was 6 weeks. It took us over a year to even get pregnant the first time. We’ve done so many tests, been to many different obgyns, 2 different fertility clinics and been met with no answers as to why it’s happening. I think that’s the most frustrating part because it’s like there’s nothing we can do or change to fix it! 

I’ve been temping and LH testing this past month, currently in the TWW. I’ve also been reading Woman Code and adjusting my diet based on her suggestions as she claims she’s cured herself of PCOS and helped women get/stay pregnant with her diet. Basically eating specific foods based on which phase of your cycle you’re in to best support your body. 🤷‍♀️ we’ll see what happens!

My first child was three when my husband and I decided to try again. When I got pregnant, I knew immediately, it felt exactly the same as my first. I was so excited, and had to wait two agonizing weeks to get a positive test before I would tell my husband. I made a plan to tell him at a local festival, involving our daughter. I let my daughter choose a tiny crocheted animal for the baby. My friend captured the announcement on video. I told my husband I thought it was a girl, I'd had the same feeling about our first, and had been right. She was due in May, it felt like divine providence. May had been the birth month of my husband's very beloved grandfather (more like a father to him) who had passed, a day after his birthday the year before. It felt almost like honoring him.

We were leaving the country  for a couple weeks, and made our first appointment for after our return. Despite severe morning sickness, we had a lovely time abroad. The date came for the first appointment. The original plan was for Husband to stay with Daughter at home. At the last minute he begged to tag along, he couldn't wait to see new baby on the ultrasound. 

In the ultrasound room, with Husband and Daughter, the sonagrapher began looking at my baby, who was already gone. I could tell something was wrong. My husband was next to me, making jokes, with no idea. I kept looking at the sonagrapher's face, waiting for her to say it. She finally did, no heartbeat.  She left the room to allow me to get dressed. ""What does that mean?"" my husband asked. 

When she held the door open on the way out my daughter asked her ""Why did you take our baby away?!"" And my husband and I rushed to explain to her that although we weren't going to be having this baby it was nobody's fault. But was it? I couldn't help the questions and the self-blame. Why had I traveled? I had hiked, and ridden on bumpy roads, was it my fault? Did I let my baby down?

My Doctor assured me it was most likely a chromosomal error, and I could play the ""what if"" game forever but would never know for sure. She said it was possible that we were wrong about our dates, and if so there was a very slim chance the pregnancy might be normal. We scheduled another appointment to check in a couple weeks. 

Every night until that appointment, before bed, my husband would lay his head on my abdomen and read from his favorite children's books. The only way he would ever get to interact with her. At the next appointment we confirmed she was gone.

I am filled with embarrassment and regret. I feel stupid for announcing my pregnancy in such a big and obvious way, and then it didn't work out. I feel stupid for traveling, even though I know it should have been safe. I feel stupid for allowing my husband to bring our daughter to the appointment, and not being able to hide my grief from her for the rawness of it. A small part of me feels stupid for being so attached to a pregnancy that was so short lived, although I know the love I feel is real.

She was barely ever here, but I miss her. We called her May, after the month she was due. More than anything, I can't let go of the desire to protect and comfort someone I never had the chance to hold, and who I failed to protect. I'm not sure I even believe this to be possible, but I hope somehow, somewhere she and my husband's grandfather have found each other and he is taking care of her for us until we can get there. I know he would have absolutely adored her.

So today was a bit of a nightmare. 


I got a letter a week past Monday to book my smear test. The letter from the hospital exactly one month after my D&C surgery, we were stressed as to what it could be. It being something so mundane was actually a relief. 

So being the good health conscious person I am, I phone, I book an appointment and I go and see the nurse.

Take a take working from home. Get to the nurse at 2 this afternoon. Go in and she won’t to the smear test because it’s too soon after the miscarriage. It needs to be 12 weeks post surgery to make sure everything is back to normal. (Totally fair: I just wish anyone had told me that before being at the doctors surgery)

She then asks me if I’m using contraception? Me: no. Asks me if I want contraception. I say no again, trying to be polite when I know I was being a little snippy. Her whole demeanour changes when it becomes extra clear it was a planned and wanted pregnancy. She Asks if I’m getting any support post miscarriage because it’s a very real, traumatic thing, not to be underplayed etc. I just cried. I’m not a crier. Until this whole experience my husband had seen my cry maybe a total of four times in the almost 8 years we’ve been together. Crying in front of people is just not enjoyable.

And I have to go back again in 5 weeks to do it all again.

<p>So today was a bit of a nightmare. </p>

<p>I got a letter a week past Monday to book my smear test. The letter from the hospital exactly one month after my D&amp;C surgery, we were stressed as to what it could be. It being something so mundane was actually a relief. </p>

<p>So being the good health conscious person I am, I phone, I book an appointment and I go and see the nurse.</p>

<p>Take a take working from home. Get to the nurse at 2 this afternoon. Go in and she won’t to the smear test because it’s too soon after the miscarriage. It needs to be 12 weeks post surgery to make sure everything is back to normal. (Totally fair: I just wish anyone had told me that before being at the doctors surgery)</p>

<p>She then asks me if I’m using contraception? Me: no. Asks me if I want contraception. I say no again, trying to be polite when I know I was being a little snippy. Her whole demeanour changes when it becomes extra clear it was a planned and wanted pregnancy. She Asks if I’m getting any support post miscarriage because it’s a very real, traumatic thing, not to be underplayed etc. I just cried. I’m not a crier. Until this whole experience my husband had seen my cry maybe a total of four times in the almost 8 years we’ve been together. Crying in front of people is just not enjoyable.</p>

<p>And I have to go back again in 5 weeks to do it all again. </p>

I had my mc on 11/28 (first pregnancy, first loss). I got pregnant via clomid because I have PCOS and had had 6 anovulatory cycles prior to that.

Not only did I discover I have PCOS and my body can't even do what it is designed for, but now it has betrayed me beyond what is humanly bearable. I have been in therapy dealing with the loss, trying to learn to trust my body, but it is not easy.

She said that since I still have PCOS I would need assistance, like last time, and asked me if I want a prescription for clomid.   
I filled my prescription, brought it home and freaked the hell out.

I’m hoping someone can assist here - or at least share their experience.

I found last cycle I started spotting around the time you would class it as ovulation bleeding. It continued for a few days and then stopped. It then came back about 8 days before my period and was quite dark/red (but not AF as was clearly older blood and was mixed with CM). AF then came on the day expected. Worth noting my LP was short that cycle.

I wrote it off as something weird as it was only my second AF since the SB of our son.

Well same thing seems to be happening! A little bit of pink spotting around ovulation and then a bit darker/dark pink. Now quite brown.

Everything I google talks to ovulation bleeding or implantation bleeding, but it’s in between those two things and I don’t think it is either. I don’t believe I have an infection as it only seems to happen during this part of my cycle.


Anyone have any ideas what I could look into? Or should I just put it down to my body adjusting back to “normal”.

I miscarried on New Years Day. I had ordered a onesie from Amazon with ""Baby \[Last Name\] July 2020"" printed on it. It arrived two days after we found out I was most likely miscarrying. When we had ordered it, the plan was to use it to announce the pregnancy to my step kids at Christmas. Well of course that didn't happen.

Now I feel like I'm going through the healing process and for whatever reason, it's important for me to do something with that onesie. The day it arrived, I kinda tossed it on the bed to show my husband and he quietly put it in his nightstand drawer. I've looked at it just one or two times since then. It's pretty painful to look at and I don't think I'm at the point where I'm ready to do anything with it, even if it's just to put it away in a box somewhere. Right now it's just in the same drawer.

What I really want to do is somehow...idk, use it to commemorate the child I never got to meet. And I don't know what exactly I have in mind. Just something private with my husband, a little ceremony of sorts. It's the only tangible thing I have from the pregnancy (I threw away the pregnancy tests, which I now regret). I never got ultrasound pictures or anything like that. I can't see myself burying it somewhere because we're military and likely to move often. I'm not sure that I want something as big/obvious as a shadow box. Burning it together with my husband seems like it might be the cathartic experience I'm looking for but I really don't want to burn it.

Anyway, sorry for the rambling, I was just wondering if anyone has done anything like this as sort of a memorial or if anyone has any ideas. I did find a charm locket necklace on Amazon that I'm going to get. I was thinking that whatever I do decide to do with the onesie, I'll do it privately with my husband and then have him put the necklace on me. I just need some type of closure.

I really want to believe we would have had a less traumatic time with a different doctor, but maybe this is just the way things work. I figured I'd make this post because it gets it out of my head for a while.  


My husband and I got pregnant after almost two years of trying to conceive, but miscarried at about ten weeks, five days. First pregnancy, no experience with any of this (which they obviously knew).

The way the OB's office broke the news to us was gut wrenching. It's burned into my brain - the Doctor said he saw a heartbeat in the exam room. We laughed. We were excited. My husband asked them if he would be getting a picture to take home today (duh) and they laughed and laughed.

Then the ultrasound tech said she would take us to ""another machine"" to get a better picture. There, (with a vaginal ultrasound) she measured and confirmed there was no heartbeat and that the fetus was about a week behind growth-wise. Basically, she told us she didn't see the heartbeat in the exam room, even though the doctor said he did.

The bigger problem was that between hearing that we had a heartbeat from the doctor and the clarifying ultrasound, we were sent to ""our"" nurse for ""OB intake"" to answer all of the questions they wanted to know about our birthing preferences, medical histories, etc. They gave us pamphlets and even a book on pregnancy, and we joked about stupid quirks of our medical history and worked through the questions... told her how relieved I was there was a heartbeat... before finding out that the doctor was wrong and there was no heartbeat.

Handing back the pamphlets and book to the OB nurse. Ugh that was a seriously messed up moment of my life. 

It was near closing time when they discovered the miscarriage and the doctor was rushing to leave, and he spent maybe five minutes with us. He told me I needed a D&C. Told me his office would call the next day (but somehow forgot the office was closed every Friday and it would be a full weekend before I got scheduled, or asked any questions). No one explained anything to me, I learned it all from Google that weekend, which was way worse.

I would love to hear good OB stories of supportive staff and doctors. Please tell me this wasn't normal!

In June of 2015 I found out that I was pregnant, a week after a break up. The pregnancy was unplanned but once I found out, very much wanted. At 6 weeks 1 day (according to the ultrasound) I went to the ER because something just didn't feel right.

I never thought I’d join this club. The club that no one wants to be a part of. The club that no one deserves to be a part of. The club that unites so many women although we may not know it because it hurts too much to talk about. To think about. We’re sad. We’re ashamed. We feel like less of a woman. Like less of a person for being in this club. 

It started with the faint positive line. The line that was so different from my first pregnancy, which was dark from the start. It was a weird cycle to begin with. I thought there was no way I was pregnant. 5 tests later, we accepted that it was true. We got pregnant again on the first try. We were so excited. But it felt different. I found myself taking a pregnancy test every morning to make sure I was actually pregnant. A week after the positive I had some spotting. Normal, some would say. I kept taking tests. A week after that we got into see my ob and he told me that he couldn’t confirm via pelvic exam that I was, indeed, pregnant. He sent my to get my betas checked. The first time there was no question. In fact, he sent me for a dating scan right away because he thought it was twins or that I was farther along than I said. Again, so different.

My results came back. I was definitely pregnant, but my levels were lower than expected. Another beta two days later. Levels rose at a VERY borderline rate. I knew something was wrong. I convinced my husband to go to the ER that night. They did an abdominal and transvaginal ultrasound and checked my betas again. Hcg dropped from the morning and they could only see the gestational sac, but nothing else. My ob recommended another blood test two days later. Levels rose slightly. Let’s do one more to be safe. And another ultrasound. Levels rose 25% and ultrasound confirmed that nothing ever formed after the fertilized egg implanted. I was not having a baby. 

In the span of 3 weeks I went from being over the moon about being pregnant again, to having the worst week of my life. I knew something was wrong. I had no control. Three weeks after we got the faint positive, I had a d&c to rid my body of what failed to develop into a viable embryo.

I feel bad for feeling bad. I already have a beautiful baby. I haven’t suffered multiple losses. We never saw a heartbeat. There are so many women who have it so much worse than I do. But I can’t stop obsessing over when I can get pregnant again. If I can get pregnant again. I’m mad that I’m not pregnant right now. I’m angry at all of the pregnancy announcements around me. I’m devastated that a time will pass where I was supposed to be giving birth. I have pictures of my little girl with her grandparents celebrating that she’s going to be a big sister that no one will ever get to see. 

The weight of a miscarriage is unfathomable until you actually experience it yourself. I don’t wish this on anyone. To anyone to has been in this position, or may be in this position, I am sorry. It’s not fair.

So my husband’s sister has two daughters aged 5 and 3. My husband and I have a 2 year old son. Our son is very close with his cousins and the three of them like to do themed costumes together on Halloween.

My oldest niece and I were talking about Halloween plans for next year and she’s got it all figured out. She is going to be Elsa, her little sister will be Anna, and my son will be Olaf. Then she said, “and the new baby will be Sven!” I was surprised but I guess I shouldn’t have been. As eventful as my miscarriage has been (was rushed to the hospital and had to have a blood transfusion, and I know my niece knew about that and said a little prayer) you can’t expect a five year old to keep up with that.

So I said, “oh, we only need three costumes this year.”

“No, Aunt Filli! Four! Because of the new baby!”

“Honey... the baby isn’t in my belly anymore. There won’t be a new baby. But, the three of you can dress up together!”

“Oh... well maybe mommy and daddy can be Sven and Kristoff then!”

She accepted it easily and the conversation was moved on from quickly. But it felt slightly like reopening the wound. Just one of the many little plans we would’ve had with the new baby.

It kinda hurt even more when it was time for us to go our separate ways at the end of the night. The three of them just adore each other and my son didn’t want to leave them. The youngest wanted him to get in her car seat with her and he climbed right in. My husband pulled him screaming and crying out of their car. Part of me feels like even in the worst case scenario where I can never give my son a sibling, at least he has cousins he’s close to. But their fun always ends with the sisters leaving together and my little boy is alone. 😔

Edit: Today I found out that the girls talked the whole way home about how my son needs to come to their house for a sleepover and the youngest was talking to her mom this morning about how her cousin was sad and crying when they left. I guess this will make sleepovers and vacations together more special when they don’t have to leave each other at the end of the night.

Also, my husband and I have discussed what would happen if we were to die or become unable to take care of our son, and agree that he would go to his sister and her husband. It’s oddly comforting to me to know that he would be living with them and have siblings if, God forbid, something like that were to happen.",[],False,,0,False,My niece didn’t know there was no more baby,[],r/ttcafterloss,False,0,,0,,,False,t3_ewhx4h,False,dark,0.98,,public,38,0,{},,,False,,False,False,,{},,False,38,,self,1580494956.0,,{},,True,,1580469544.0,text,0,,,self.ttcafterloss,True,"<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=""md""><p>TW: living child</p>

My miscarriage experience was so traumatic, I couldn’t find similar stories online and was wondering if anyone in this group experienced what I did. I guess I’m looking to feel normal, which is probably impossible. I’m also RH negative if that’s means anything...

It all started with light spotting, got an ultrasound and it got worse...got another ultrasound and the baby was fine but they asked to do a vaginal
Ultrasound to see more and I said yes which I now deeply regret. After the vagina ultrasound they detected a heart beat but I started bleeding even heavier accompanied by cramps which i did not have before. The next day, I got the most intense cramps I have ever felt in my entire life, fell on the bathroom floor screaming in pain, started having a panic attack, my entire body went numb and I couldn’t move. My husband had to call an ambulance because I thought I was going to die since I was passing out. They carried me out of the house and took me to the hospital. This pain lasted for about an hour and then stopped. I felt like I had a pool of blood in my pants and went to the washroom to try and clean up. When I pulled down my pants, my baby, in full, came out and on to my underwear with the placenta wrapped around them. There wasn’t even any blood... my child and the placenta were clean tissue and the blood came after when I went to the bathroom and have had spotting ever since. The nurse took my baby and left the room. It was awful. Has anyone had a miscarriage like that? Contractions and then the baby coming out in full at 7 weeks with no blood...? Is something wrong with me? Most of the stories I read, mothers bleed the baby out in pieces and it’s a serious of events... 

On another note, I swear getting a vaginal ultrasound made things worse. I started looking things up because of my experience and here are some articles about ultrasounds that I think you all should take a look at. It’s seriously eye opening and I will never get a vaginal
Ultrasound again or a regular ultrasound before the second trimester.

There was never a baby, just a sac, so I was surprised at how much I was bleeding. They had to do a blood transfusion and an emergency D&C. 

After the D&C, I’ve continued to bleed for the next week. I would call it similar to a light period or spotting. I never even used a pad for it.

Then last night, we came home from church, had just had dinner, and I was walking to the kitchen when I felt a sudden gush.

I went to the bathroom and blood was just pouring out. I grabbed one of the adult diapers I had left over and it filled pretty much immediately.

So we went to the ER. But we waited for a couple of hours and it seemed like we would be there all night. My bleeding had already slowed way down. After the initial gush of blood, it went right back to my new normal of a light period. So we left.

This morning, I woke up to a clean pad. But as I started walking around throughout the morning, I did start bleeding again and at one point there was a clot. But again, it’s still pretty much my normal at this point.

My brother in law works at the hospital and got my charts for me. He said everything looks good from last night and he doesn’t see any reason to panic. My husband just switched jobs and we won’t have insurance until Monday. We are having to rely on cobra for the time being. 

There’s a free clinic we can visit once I get my medical records and I intend to go this evening to see a doctor.

I’m just wondering if anyone has any experience with this? My first thought on seeing all the blood was, “something went wrong! My uterus is broken! I’m completely infertile now or I will need a hysterectomy!”
