So my hubby and I had a loss a few years back that we processed together but never acknowledged with anyone really.

DH was 100% present and we got through it together. 
My family is non-existent and DH family lives on the E coast (we are west - DH moved here Seattle for a job a few years ago and never looked back).

5,2048,confidence,<praw.reddit.Reddit object at 0x7f12a630cd90>,,ttcafterloss,"Hi everyone,
Let me introduce myself, my name is sharkyandro.
On February 2nd I got the devastating news that I had suffered what was technically a missed miscarriage at 10w2d. As we had used assisted reproduction (medicated IUIs) to achieve the pregnancy, I was very well followed by my clinic. The ultrasound where we confirmed the heart beat had stopped had actually been our 5th ultrasound.

Our first ultrasound at 6 weeks appeared normal but maybe a bit too early for a heartbeat, at 7 weeks it was measuring a bit behind and had not developed a heart beat yet, at 8 weeks it was measuring very behind but there was a heart beat of 118 bpm. At 9 weeks we were still very behind but the heart beat continued at the same rate. At 10 weeks  we were able to see the heart beat had stopped. In that 10th week, the baby only measured 6w3d.
We had been discussing D&C for awhile. It was even offered to me after that 4th ultrasound, when the heart beat still existed. I was adamant that if I was going to lose this baby, it would be on it's own time. I would not be having an abort!on while it's little heart still fought for life. 
When we got the news that the heart beat had stopped, I chocked back tears and managed to form the words to request the D&C. My doctor was able to fit me in the same afternoon. The procedure went quickly and painlessly and in no time I was home, broken and head spinning from the events of the past month.
We had conceived using donor sperm and medicated IUI, this had been our 4th attempt. We had really, really, really wanted this pregnancy.
Post D&C they were able to do testing. My doctor called me to let me know the baby had trisomy 20- a trisomy which is 'incompatible with life'. I hesitated, and asked her if the document also stated the baby's sex chromosomes. She said it did, and I asked her to please tell me. I had lost my baby girl. 

This is all so fresh still, it hasn't even been 3 weeks. I cry every day still. I only missed one day of work, for the D&C, and have spent most work days fighting back tears. On weekends I've been a lump on the couch,  crying on and off. For the first 2 weeks I ate my feelings, putting on weight I had fought so hard to lose to try to conceive. I had lost 80 lbs in the past year to get my body into the best possible physical state to carry a pregnancy. 
Yesterday I stepped on the scale and was distressed that I had managed to put on 9 lbs. Though at this point it's unclear how much of that is actually fat from calories, how much is waste weight, how much is water weight from all the junk food. 
In those 2 weeks I also stopped taking my various vitamins and supplements. I feel like I stopped taking care of myself, in a weird form of self care? I had taken such careful care of myself in order to get pregnant and psychologically that broke me: look where it left me. Heart broken and without the baby I so desperately wanted to be pregnant with.
So, I took a break. I took a break from eating clean, I took a break from supplements. In this time I grieved, and cried, and slept.
On Friday my husband and I came to a decision on a new sperm donor (our 3rd donor, sperm is never in stock argh), and submitted the order. I'm slowly getting my head back into the TTC game. While my period is still likely 2-4 weeks away, I'm taking control again. I threw out candy and cookies. I went shopping and filled my fridge with vegetables, fruit, chicken, legumes. Yesterday I ate healthy food, drank water. I will do the same today. One foot in front of the other. Every day I will try to be a little better.

After 8 cycles of trying for a baby we were finally successful, then at my 16 week scan my obstetrician couldn't find a heart beat. The next day I had a more in depth scan that dated the baby at roughly 15 weeks, no heart beat. I then went to hospital to start the labour process. 5 hours later I was holding my little girl who had passed from a cord accident. It was the single most excruciatingly heart breaking moment of my life. As, unfortunately, so many of you can relate.

We have been grieving for almost 3 months and I thought we were doing quite well. My first cycle we tried to concieve and it was devastating when I got my period. I'm in the 'two week wait' of cycle 2 and a few days ago my brother and his wife announced their pregnancy. They're 10 weeks. We had dinner with my family tonight and my sister in law started telling me all about her pregnancy and I felt like it would be rude to ask her to stop, but I was so hurt. A while after I had to leave the room so I wouldn't cry infront of everyone. 

I am really happy for them, but I am still incredibly sad at my own situation. I am very close to my family, we have weekly dinners, but I don't think I can continue to go while I am still grieving and not yet pregnant. If anyone is still reading this far, what would you do? Should I tell them that I need some time and just avoid them for a while, not knowing how long it will take for me to conceive again? Or just avoid them without saying anything? Get over myself? Uhh this whole process sucks.

<p>However, now something closer to home has hurt even more. One of my good friends from high school who I&#39;ve been reconnecting with recently found out that she was 24 weeks pregnant with her ex&#39;s baby. She didn&#39;t think to take a test until not having her period for 5 months. She was not very big so it just looked like she could have that body type where she carries her weight that way, though she&#39;s not obese. She just got an abor+!on the other day and of course she&#39;s distraught. It&#39;s really hard to be supportive when I&#39;m so jealous.</p>

<p>I want to be pregnant again so badly. I&#39;m happy to be trying again and to be a part of this community that truly understands.</p>

<p>If you read any or all of this I sincerely appreciate it. </p>

After my BIL and SIL decided that a good way to announce their similar-age pregnancy was making us listen to the heart beat on video chat with absolutely zero warning or context, I had a huge set back in my emotional recovery and cried the rest of the evening and again at work. I've been raw and miserable. I am back in ""take it day by day"" or even ""take it hour by hour"" again. This was the last straw after an onslaught of insensitive, dismissive comments that had been smaller sources of pain and anger. Here's the letter:

Almost every interaction has been a new source of hurt for me. Over and over again my feelings, physical pain, and trauma was brushed aside, papered over with shallow optimism or compartmentalized as something lesser. It is not over, I did not have a miscarriage, and this isn’t just a small hiccup. This is one of the worst traumas of my life and definitely the worst trauma of ---Husband’s Name---’s life. I am missing part of my reproductive system. Another pregnancy, at whatever diminished rate that occurs, will not erase what happened. There are images and sounds seared into both of our minds. I got to the point where pain was the only thing that existed for me and I yearned for unconsciousness. I was drowning on the inside ---On my own blood--- and struggling for breath. My organs were on the brink of shutting down from blood loss. ---Husband’s Name--- held his dying wife for hours, screaming and pale as a sheet, while flailing at the callous medical staff to try to get interventions to save my life. Mentally morphing it into a miscarriage or a small affair may make it easier for you to digest, but that is not a luxury we have. We were totally abandoned in our grief and trauma. And no care was put into handling a very sensitive subject just 6 weeks later - we had fought and struggled for a sonogram that very morning, something that would have saved us from the worst part of this whole thing - hoisting a very visceral audio recording on us with no warning or context is the worst possible way I can think of announcing a pregnancy that’s almost the exact same age as our was. I cried all evening until I fell asleep and again at work, huddled alone on the bathroom floor.

That being said, I don’t think any of you are doing this intentionally. I think you are so profoundly unskilled emotionally that you struggle to think of the proper reaction and then give up or don’t think things through. Somewhere under the fight-or-flight response, I'm really happy for ---Sister-in-law--- and ---Brother-in-law---. But I am in no condition to teach you all about trauma or instruct you on how to be compassionate right now. I would have hoped you all would have thought to read up on it yourself, honestly. There is a wealth of information you could have consulted. I need to heal and to do that I need to be in a place where my wounds are not constantly being inflamed. ---Husband--- will call you when we’re ready to reestablish contact, but in the meantime, please leave us to take care of each other. Please don't contact us via email, text or anything else until he reaches out first.

In June 2016 I came off birth control at the age of 32. I always thought it may take a while to have a family but it never even occurred to me it would be due to losses. We lost our first in Oct 2016 found out at the 12 wk NT scan, baby measured 8 weeks chose to have a D&c. Took a bit of time off as we were getting married in Jan but got pregnant again after 4 or so cycles. That one never really got going and after numerous early ultrasounds had another D&c at what would have been 9 weeks in June.
Yesterday we received the horrible news that our most recent baby had no heartbeat at 16 weeks. Everything had been perfect, low risk for chromosomal issues, no spotting or warnings and still we have heartbreak.

I am out of hope at this point. I am not looking forward to the prospect of being induced (apparently they won’t do surgery this far on), the hormone crash and the testing. Not to mention the prospect of having to go through another first trimester of daily vomiting when we decide we are up to trying again. 

For those of you that have had multiple MMC’s have you ever found any ideas or answers as to why your body holds onto pregnancies?
Anyone with no patterns to their losses get an answer of some sort from RPL testing?  
Those of you that were induced for second trimester losses have any advice or insight into the process to ease my fears?

I've posted my story here once before, but here's a quick recap: MMC November 2016 followed by a D&C, then an ectopic and salpingectomy the following March. Since then, we've been unable to get pregnant at all, so we just started seeing a fertility specialist. We've been going through the whole battery of tests for the past few weeks. Prior to my HSG, I (of course) read everything Google had to offer, and got pretty damn nervous! It didn't help that my husband was away for work that week, so I had to go alone. But, with the help of some ibuprofen and half a Xanax, I made it to the clinic. 

As it turns out, I was nervous over nothing. I had fairly little discomfort, even on the side without a tube where they said I might feel more pressure. I asked the NP about it, and she told me that there's a lot of variation in how they perform the test that can lead to very different experiences. My clinic didn't use a catheter with a balloon to keep the dye in there; they just let it flow. Also, instead of asking me to tilt and move around, the X-ray machine was on a mobile arm - I stayed still the whole time. The whole thing took maybe 2-3 minutes. Although I know this is very much a your-mileage-may-vary situation, I would have been less panicked about the procedure if I'd known about the range of ways it can be performed, and which way my doc did it. Hopefully this will help the next freaked out HSG googler :)

So on the wikipedia page for Asherman's syndrome, it quotes a study that says up to 30.9% of D&Cs performed for missed miscarriages result in Asherman's syndrome. Other studies show rates closer to 20%. What???

One thing that surprised me was how incredibly unhelpful the doctors office was. When I first got a positive test, they tried to schedule an intake US at the six week mark, but my ob was booked up for three months. So I ended up affiliated with some random new OB, and I think part of the problem was that half my messages ended up with her and half were sent to ""my"" OB. Emails to the care provider got replied to by one of their staff, and then I'd hit ""reply"" with a follow-up question and get a reply to that from someone else. I hardly ever talked to the same person twice so I had to explain what was happening from scratch every time I called in.

HCG results took like 24+ hours to come back (but was magically available 20 minutes after I called to ask where the result was). My email about whether to test (and consider supplementing) progesterone got overlooked. I eventually asked ""isn't waiting missing the chance to do something?"" and they just stuck to the script. 

Is this normal? It feels worse than the experiences I had at Kaiser before we switched insurance, but maybe I have inaccurately rosy memories.

So now, while I know that objectively this wasn't their ""fault,"" I also feel like they didn't do anything to help try to prevent it.  They didn't really care. Right when I most urgently wanted some medical monitoring and possibly assistance, they were unavailable. There was hardly any ""they"" there; it was a group inbox and a phone tree. And their database thought I was still very pregnant, so I kept fielding questions like ""have you been seen yet for this pregnancy"" and having to correct them that it wasn't exactly a pregnancy anymore.

So now, I want to meet with an OB to make a plan for getting pregnant and what they'll do to monitor hormones etc. the next time. But even though I know it's irrational, I feel so angry at them that I can't exactly bring myself to do that. I don't want to stick with the new OB I randomly picked, because her staff was part of not replying. But how to choose another OB? And maybe this was dumb, but I tried telling the last person I talked to how angry I was, and what I hoped we could do moving forward, thinking that would yield resolution, [ETA: I just described my frustration and how hard it had been to have to repeat the story for every new person, and asked if it made sense to have a follow up appointment; I wasn't yelling at a random staff member], but it only made it worse because she was clearly in phone-manners ""I'm so sorry that happened to you"" as opposed to like, really caring. It was just another database entry to her, it seemed.

So then I think ""well, it's not healthy to hate your OB's office, and it's not healthy to feel like their hold music is mournfully saying 'I'm sorry you lost the pregnancy,' and it's not good that you know just exactly how many seconds the 'we are experiencing a higher than average call volume' message is, so you need to find a different OB's office."" But I try researching it and then think, well they're all probably the same anyway, and at least I know the pitfalls with this place, and this is the largest practice group in the area so it's probably the best despite everything. But then I wonder, are they really?? I mean, my dentist is a small office, but they're much more human about things.

Anyway, is this normal? Does anyone have any tips, either about finding an OB's office that's better or for getting over this at least to the extent of making my next appointment? I feel like if I make one, I'll just want to tell them how frustrated I was and then dealing with them trying to patiently tolerate me, and I just want to have a good relationship with some helpful place.

<p>So then I think &quot;well, it&#39;s not healthy to hate your OB&#39;s office, and it&#39;s not healthy to feel like their hold music is mournfully saying &#39;I&#39;m sorry you lost the pregnancy,&#39; and it&#39;s not good that you know just exactly how many seconds the &#39;we are experiencing a higher than average call volume&#39; message is, so you need to find a different OB&#39;s office.&quot; But I try researching it and then think, well they&#39;re all probably the same anyway, and at least I know the pitfalls with this place, and this is the largest practice group in the area so it&#39;s probably the best despite everything. But then I wonder, are they really?? I mean, my dentist is a small office, but they&#39;re much more human about things.</p>

<p>Anyway, is this normal? Does anyone have any tips, either about finding an OB&#39;s office that&#39;s better or for getting over this at least to the extent of making my next appointment? I feel like if I make one, I&#39;ll just want to tell them how frustrated I was and then dealing with them trying to patiently tolerate me, and I just want to have a good relationship with some helpful place.</p>

<p>Sorry this is kind of a rant.</p>

I’m going nuts here. Everything I loved reminds me I’m not pregnant anymore. For example, video games made me motion sick when pregnant, now they don’t and I hate it. I can handle them on a good day but I have more bad days then good. I’m not sleeping well and I have *constant* bags under my eyes now. My body grosses me out because I had just started showing at 12 weeks and now it’s back to how it was (I’m 20 lbs lighter, so I lost 10% of my body weight, than when I got pregnant because I was so sick).

I’ve been begging work for hours and finally started applying for another job because 20 hours/week wasn’t enough and I’m going nuts. I have an interview on Wednesday thankfully. I can’t even save money for future baby because I’m not getting enough hours right now. 

I’m losing my mind and I’m trying to come to terms with waiting. But I’m terrified because I have trouble conceiving (I have >100 days cycles, for pregnant on CD 212 last time). If we try in two years when I’m 27, and it can take a year to “normalize”, and my cycles continue like this, I could be in my 30’s before I conceive and it sticks. I know I’m young and there’s no real reason to think anything is wrong and I probably just have had bad luck but I’m afraid.

My poor husband has been tip toeing around me this month. He doesn&#39;t know what to say and he just listens as I rant about how everyone else is getting pregnant right now, mostly people who will admit they weren&#39;t even trying!
I don&#39;t know about you guys, but the most frustrating thing close friends and family have been saying to me lately (when I bring up my due date approaching) is &quot;Oh it&#39;ll happen soon for you...&quot; does anyone else ever get that? It makes me want to scream. 
Anyway, if you&#39;ve made it to the end of my post, thank you for listening! I&#39;m hoping some of you understand what I&#39;m feeling!! </p>

My past miscarriages have been 2 chemical and 1 partial molar twin pregnancy other than this ectopic tubal pregnancy. 

I am wondering if anyone else on this board is recovering from an ectopic pregnancy with the loss of a tube. I don’t really know what this recovery looks like. I was still in shock I think after the emergency surgery that I didn’t really ask some questions I probably should have asked.   

How long will I be super sore? I am 2 days post op and hobbling around. 

My HCG level was down to 24 this morning.

How long until we can try again?

What will my cycles look like? Will the loss of a tube mess with my hormones? They left the ovary thank goodness although I guess it just chills there in case we ever need eggs from it. 
 
At this point I need to wait a few cycles mentally and just because this bout has had me miss a few days of work.  

How do I get past the fact that we seem to always be in the bad end of all of the percentages? 1% of pregnancies are molar, 2% are ectopic... of the ectopic 15% are not able to be fixed with methotrexate (I had 2 shots before the rupture). 

I am a generally positive person, but I am struggling to believe that we are ever going to beat the odds.

**Longwinded Exposition:** I've been going to my ob/gyn office for a long time. I started there because it's the office my mother goes to/recommended when I needed one at 18, and since then, for gyn appointments I've liked them just fine. I assumed that when I got pregnant I would continue seeing them because their location is so conveniently located in a doctor's pavilion connected to a very good local hospital where I planned to deliver one day.

But since I've switched to the OB side of the same office, I have not been impressed. Even going back to my first appointment when things were ""ok"" I was not really happy with the information I received (aka NONE) regarding my pregnancy. When we went in for my first appointment I got a US, the tech said ""oh you're not as far along as you think. We can't see anything yet. Come back in two weeks!"" and sent us on our way. No vitals taken (weight, bp, nothing) no info packets given. Literally in and out in 10 minutes. And now, since the MMC, it's just been a shitshow. They almost didn't even tell me I was having a miscarriage! I mean, I had figured it out on my own, but I never spoke to the doctor confirming it before some nurse/secretary called me saying ""Your numbers are going down, so just keep getting blood tests every 2 weeks until your hCG levels are zero."" UM. What? The last time I spoke to the doctor he said there was a 50/50 chance things were fine, sooo what are you telling me? I haven't had *any* bleeding... There's more, but I've told this story a few times. It's in my post history, so I won't get too into it. 

But the bottom line is... Here I am waiting out a MMC. 14 days since I figured it out on my own. 1 week since it was actually confirmed to me, and 5 weeks since the embryo stopped developing at 6w. Still nothing, and my doctor won't discuss intervention until I do one more hCG test, which I'm doing after work today. After this is over, I think I'm done.

I've never had to change doctors before (I've been lucky not to have had a lot of medical issues) so I'm not quite sure what to expect. I've found an OB/GYN office that is at a satellite campus for the same hospital and it is practically right down the street from my house! (current office/main hospital is about 25-30 minutes away.) I imagine I won't have to do much record transferring if I go there since its all connected. Should I call and ask for a consultation appointment when we're ready to start ttc again? Do I have to inform my current doctor about the change, even if it's basically in the same practice, just a different office? I know I should just call the new office and ask, but I just wanted to hear if anyone else switched their OBs after a miscarriage situation, prior to getting pregnant again... Thanks!

This makes me an expert in what it feels like to be in early pregnancy. A somewhat dubious expertise. I am usually able to tell starting about 8-9 DPO, days before a test can show a positive. The weirdest superpower I've heard of.
We've been trying for over a year. When I see other women conceive on their first try and go on to have completely normal, ""boring"" pregnancies, I get so mad and then so ashamed of myself.
I am currently about 10-12 days post ovulation. I pee every 30 minutes, and my body feels exactly as it did these past 3 times.
And I am terrified. Terrified that I might hurt it somehow. Terrified of getting a positive. Terrified of of getting a negative. Terrified that I might be hallucinating this entire thing.

We&#39;ve been trying for over a year. When I see other women conceive on their first try and go on to have completely normal, &quot;boring&quot; pregnancies, I get so mad and then so ashamed of myself.
I am currently about 10-12 days post ovulation. I pee every 30 minutes, and my body feels exactly as it did these past 3 times.

I started on this crazy journey with my LMP(withdrawal bleed, stopped the pill) on 12/6/17. I suspect I ovulated around 12/27. I had what I thought was a period, but was much lighter than normal, on 1/6-1/9. On 1/18 I started mildly spotting, and on 1/19 I got a positive OPK and also a positive HCG test. So I called my doctor. Beta was 76. Retested Monday, beta 154. Spotting stopped the next day.

On 1/29, I did some of my normal exercise in the morning, and started having a tight muscle feeling on my left side, near my pelvic bone. On that day it was accompanied by light pink spotting upon wiping, and there was one dollop of what appeared to be dark red CM. Spotting stopped within an hour, didn’t think much of it. 

Fast forward to 2/1 where we go for an ultrasound. There was nothing. No sac, no yolk, nothing whatsoever. More bloodwork ordered. Beta level a 51, and on 2/3 a 23. Doctor says it’s a MC, and to expect bleeding. Nothing’s happened, and a urine test is stark white. I took an OPK out of curiousness and it was super positive. Both today.

So I want to start trying because I feel that the CM I had on that day was the MC, and I don’t want to miss an opportunity, but I don’t want to make things worse.

93,2048,confidence,<praw.reddit.Reddit object at 0x7f12a630cd90>,,ttcafterloss,"I really appreciated all the posts here and other places about how the misoprostol aka medical miscarriage experience was like, so I wanted to share mine here in case anyone needs the info. 

Background: My baby stopped growing at around 9-10 weeks, I found out at my 11 week appointment. I had no symptoms of miscarriage (no cramps, no bleeding). Doctor wanted me to wait for a bit, so I did, but after about 2 weeks of waiting, I started spotting very lightly, and decided to take misoprostol at the recommendation of my doctor. I wanted D&C, but he said that he was afraid that I might have scarring in my uterus. 1st pregnancy, 1st miscarriage. 

**8PM**
I started cramping and having contractions, so even though I had originally planned to take the med the next morning (so I will have a whole day to 'labor'), I went ahead and inserted misoprostol (first 4 pills) vaginally. I waited and within 30-40 minutes, I could feel some burning sensation, and increased pain in my uterus that would come and go in about 5-10 min interval. I was laying down, trying to relax. 

**10-11 PM**
First gush and blood and tissues came out. I could feel it coming, too, so I was able to do this in the bathroom. Along with blood, a small egg-size grey-ish mass came out. I thought this was the sac + baby, so I started tearing up, but when I broke it open, there was nothing in there that looked like a baby, so I flushed it down the toilet. Contractions along with severe back pain continued. I inserted 4 more pills as directed.

**11:45PM**
The pain was at its worst, I was cold and shivering, and the blood/clots/tissues size of my fist were now coming up so quickly and constantly, I just decided to sit in my bathtub, naked from waist down. No position was comfortable, so I kept switching between standing and squatting/sitting. Every time I squatted, more stuff came out. I could no longer feel the pain because I was so focused on getting everything out. The blood and everything else literally filled the tub. I went through every single clot to find the baby. And finally, I did -- at around 2 AM. A small pinky sized baby was found in one of the bigger clots. It had perfect little arms and legs and eyes. I cried and my husband came and hugged me. I scooped everything else into the toilet and flushed, and decided to take a shower. It was around 3AM. 

**3AM**
I finished showering but this was a mistake, as I started to bleed and expelling a lot of stuff again. I did not know that I could have so much stuff inside of me. I did not even get a chance to dry myself with a towel, but just had to squat back down, watching more and more blood and tissues come out. I was getting so tired by now. 

**4AM** 
I suddenly realized that I had not been drinking water, so I started drinking a huge bottle of water...then I had to pee so I sat on the toilet. Then out of nowhere, I started to feel dizzy, and I looked down, expecting to see urine come out of me, but instead it was bright red blood shooting out of me -- it was as if there was a blood filled water gun inside of me, and someone was shooting. I filled the toilet with blood and I started to get scared for the first time. Within 10-15 min (blood coming out the whole time), I felt light-headed and passed out. My husband came in (he says he heard a crashing noise -- prob my arms knocking over some stuff as falling) and found me collapsed and mumbling gibberish. I was in a weird half awake, half asleep state. Somehow I came back and had some juice which made me feel A LOT better. I felt almost normal, but the bleeding wouldnt stop, so I had to sit back in the tub for about 1 hour. 

**6 AM**
The bleeding slowed down a bit -- 1 overnight pad per hour -- so my husband decided that he would make me a bed on the floor of our living room. He wanted to put me into a real bed, but I was afraid that I might bleed everywhere, so I opted for the floor, but it was comfortable. Yoga mat + fluffy blankets. It was much more comfortable then the bathtub. 

**8AM** 
Bleeding finally slowed down A LOT more. I showered and moved to the bed and slept for about 4 hours straight. I only woke up because of very painful contractions. 

That's pretty much it. 12 hours. I have very high tolerance and am physically fit, but oh boy, this was a whole different thing. I am thankful that I did not hurt myself while passing out. Honestly, I don't know why my doctor did not warn me about this. He told me that the pain would be ""moderate to severe cramping like when you have your period"" and that the bleeding would be mild to heavy and that I would need to have a lot of overnight pads. Umm.....no, the pain so extreme that I had to take prescription pain killer every 2-3 hours and the bleeding was so crazy that I did not leave the tub for the most part. 

I really do not recommend this whole process to anyone who is as far along as me. I just talked to a friend who miscarried at 6-7 weeks, and she told me that it was a whole different experience for her (about 2-3 hours of heaving bleeding, little tissues, and bleeding stopped after 1 day). For me, I am still bleeding HEAVILY and it has been 4 days. 

Anyway, I hope this helps some of you guys out there make a decision. God forbid if I have another miscarriage, I am getting a D&C because misoprostol at home is just a terrifying, painful experience. Have someone with you THE WHOLE TIME if you have to do it. 


**EDIT**

Thank you all for your support, advice, and encouragement. I just wanted to add that this is day 5, and that I am still experience steady medium to heavy bleeding (changing overnight pad every 3-4 hours) and pretty severe cramping (uterus and back pain). I plan to wait 2 more days, and if things don't improve, I will be calling up my doctor like many of you guys suggested. It is still so shocking to me that my doctor did not prepare me for any of this. He did mention that I will have bleeding after it's all over but didn't say how much is normal. He said nothing about the pain in my back/uterus. 

Hope all of you guys here have a good, supportive doctor! I will be switching as soon as I am able. 

**2ND EDIT/UPDATE**
If anyone finds this, I did not want to leave you hanging. Day 7. A HUGE blood clot came out this morning of day 7 since misoprostol, and suddenly pain/contractions/bleeding have all dwindled down A LOT. Just pink-ish spotting and very little pain now.

I got pregnant in July after two years of trying. I've always been anovulatory but it got worse after two rounds of cancer treatment (last one May 2013).

So got pregnant, super happy. Then he was measuring small and we lost him at 23 weeks on December 28.

I was able to deliver him and the placenta naturally. I obviously bled for a while. Negative pregnancy test on the 9th and Blood HCG at 4 on the 15th. I had ""fresh"" blood on the 18th which my doctor and I believe was CD1. I had a light 5 day period. I had been temping (although I can't make heads or tails of it, cross posted to r/TFABChartStalkers) and using OPKs. According to the OPKs my peak fertility was on CD17 (Saturday). Sunday evening I had brown spotting/discharge and today it seems to be more red.

I have a call into my RE but just wanted to see if this has happened to any of you or if it makes any sense.

Thanks!!

**Update:** Officially seems to be a period. It makes no sense to me since I supposedly ovulated Saturday (although the temps make no sense: https://www.reddit.com/r/TFABChartStalkers/comments/7vew8y/introspotting_with_ovulation_story_in_comments).

But if it is a period I had a super short cycle. Does that have any affect on how ""viable"" the next cycle might be?

I also have blood work scheduled tomorrow to hopefully give more answers.

I was active in my baby bumpers group, but for some reason posting here seemed like it would make our loss too real. It’s been almost a month now, and I think I’m finally ready to become active here.

A quick intro: I found out I was pregnant in early December. My symptoms were very mild from the beginning so I was overly cautious and prepared for the worst. Due to the holidays, I wasn’t seen by my doctor until the first week of January when I was 8 weeks. My first ultrasound was scheduled for Friday 1/19 but I was in the ER that Monday confirming my MMC at 10 weeks (a blighted ovum).

My blood work this week confirmed my HCG is back to zero and I was told we can try again after I have regular cycles. How long was it until you received your first period after your MC? Were you told to wait a few cycles or did you try right away after that first cycle?

<p>A quick intro: I found out I was pregnant in early December. My symptoms were very mild from the beginning so I was overly cautious and prepared for the worst. Due to the holidays, I wasn’t seen by my doctor until the first week of January when I was 8 weeks. My first ultrasound was scheduled for Friday 1/19 but I was in the ER that Monday confirming my MMC at 10 weeks (a blighted ovum).</p>

<p>My blood work this week confirmed my HCG is back to zero and I was told we can try again after I have regular cycles. How long was it until you received your first period after your MC? Were you told to wait a few cycles or did you try right away after that first cycle?</p>

My husband and I conceived for the first time on my second cycle off OCP’s last September. At 7 weeks I had a fairly heavy bleed. I thought I had miscarried, but the ultrasound showed TWINS! Two healthy tiny babies... and a tiny bleed behind one of the placentas. But the bleeding stopped and all seemed well. We were very nervous... a high risk pregnancy as our very first. But at 12 weeks we allowed ourselves more excitement, real hope... the statistics were with us. Diamniotic dichorionic twins were very likely to go to 36 weeks if not 38 even! At each ultrasound all was well. Couldn’t see the previous bleed... babies growing perfectly well... the 20 week ultrasound confirmed we had a baby girl Eleanor and a baby boy Otto. As the first grandbabies on both sides, family immediately began sending me clothes, books and nursery furniture. We were so ready. 

On January 24, I woke up at 5 am with bad pelvic pain. I thought it was constipation... it went away soon. Then it woke me up again an hour later, and I had some bleeding. We went to the ER and by 7 am the doctor on call told me, “you’re in labor. Your cervix is completely dilated.” I felt my world crash down... “but they can’t survive... what if I stay on bedrest? Are you sure there’s no cervix left? What about a cerclage? Can I be shipped somewhere else?” I knew the answers already... 

After 12 hours of wrestling with the idea that our lives would suddenly no longer be centered around the promise of our babies’ futures here on earth, I agreed to an epidural, which relaxed my body enough that Otto came into the world. Ellie came 23 minutes later. My husband and I held them their entire lives... nearly 4 hours for Otto and nearly 3 for Ellie. They spent their lives in our arms and side by side. I know they knew our love. They made us parents, they changed us. 

Now I grieve with the heaviest of hearts alongside my sweet husband. We will never be whole again... two pieces will forever be missing. 

The working theory is the subchorionic hemorrhage must have still been present and turned into an abruption. Little Ellie’s placenta just couldn’t hold on any longer. I did suffer a fall on the ice 48 hours before, landing on my bum. My doctor has assured me over and over that a fall on the bum wouldn’t cause this. If it did, she says it would have happened that same day. I hope she’s right, but at the same time I don’t know if I can accept that this is a mere coincidence. 

My doctor says we can try to conceive again as soon as I feel ready. It’s only been a week and a half. But I’m so ready to hold babies in my empty arms.

The doctors assumed we lost him due to either a genetic defect or underdeveloped kidneys/lungs. Genetic issues were a real concern because my husband's family has a lot of genetic abnormalities. 

The doctors advised against an autopsy because if the genetics didn't show anything, than the likelihood was it wouldn't repeat in further pregnancies. Cue three months of genetic tests on both my husband and I, testing on the placenta, and two very invasive internal exams to make sure I didn't have defects with my uterus. Everything came up as normal, or as the geneticist said ""genetically boring."" 

Because of this, our original wait time has gone from six cycles to three. My third cycle is next week. I have a pre-conception meeting with a maternal fetal medicine doctor on day 2 to decide how to proceed once I get pregnant again. I was so excited, but suddenly I'm having flashbacks of my first pregnancy and the loss of my son. Sometimes they are so vivid I can actually smell the baby oil they rubbed on his skin, and can feel his skin touching mine. It's making me feel apprehensive to try again, even though the doctors are assuring me that this was random and only has a 5% of recurrence. I know that pregnancies are never perfect or easy. Something ALWAYS goes wrong, even if it's minor. But I am so freaked out I feel like I'm reliving my loss! Has anyone else experienced this? 

Last time, we told family at 9 weeks and friends at 12, and everyone got so excited and began giving us baby items, which are now boxed up in my mom's storage room. This time, I'm not sure I want anyone to know when we are pregnant until baby is 20 weeks and showing as heathy, since that's when we found out about my son's issues. I don't want to announce to extended family or anyone I don't see on a near daily basis until after baby is born and home safe. I'm freaking out. Any advice or experiences would be great!

I was so excited, but suddenly I&#39;m having flashbacks of my first pregnancy and the loss of my son. Sometimes they are so vivid I can actually smell the baby oil they rubbed on his skin, and can feel his skin touching mine. It&#39;s making me feel apprehensive to try again, even though the doctors are assuring me that this was random and only has a 5% of recurrence. I know that pregnancies are never perfect or easy. Something ALWAYS goes wrong, even if it&#39;s minor. But I am so freaked out I feel like I&#39;m reliving my loss! Has anyone else experienced this? </p>

<p>Last time, we told family at 9 weeks and friends at 12, and everyone got so excited and began giving us baby items, which are now boxed up in my mom&#39;s storage room. This time, I&#39;m not sure I want anyone to know when we are pregnant until baby is 20 weeks and showing as heathy, since that&#39;s when we found out about my son&#39;s issues. I don&#39;t want to announce to extended family or anyone I don&#39;t see on a near daily basis until after baby is born and home safe. I&#39;m freaking out. Any advice or experiences would be great!</p>

However, my beta HCG and progesterone blood levels are extremely low- have gone from 29 to 57 to 149 in the span of this week and progesterone has hovered around 0.7 this whole time. Had an ultrasound and the doc could see absolutely nothing, just a little pocket of fluid in my uterus. It’s definitely not viable, and I’m seriously hoping at this point the HCG has hit its little peak and will plateau and/or go down on its own by the next time i go in, but part of me wants to take the methotrexate and get it over with because I’m so terrified of rupturing a tube if it did indeed implant there.

I’m not sure what to expect, side effect or pain wise. My other option was to do an endometrial biopsy first, which would essentially accomplish the same end goal (disrupting the growth of this tissue), only it just seems unnecessary to put myself through something so painful. I guess the crux of my question is... for anyone that’s experienced this and presented with those two options, whatd you go with? What can I expect? A long road of getting my cycles back to normal?  This is all very scary, stressful and sad, not to mention isolating.
