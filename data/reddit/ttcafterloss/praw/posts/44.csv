2,2048,confidence,<praw.reddit.Reddit object at 0x7f12a630cd90>,,ttcafterloss,"Hi, I am 40 years old and we have two boys, 14 yo and 6 yo. We started TTC in November 2016. I have PCOS and was obese and one of the things we decided was that I had to lose so much weight before we started TTC that all my blood work came back healthy. I lost about 6 kg in 2015 but I really started to lose weight in May 2016. Between May and October I lost another 12 kg and my blood work came back alright (I had had insulin resistance issues before), so we started TTC in November. I had a CP in December /January. And finally a BFP in May 2017. I had never had morning sickness, now I did. So we think, it might have been a girl. Everything looked fine at our 8 week scan. Heart rate and seize was fine. But at the 10 week scan there was no heartbeat. It is still unsettling to think at the grey picture on the u/s-device that should have showed the colorful heartbeat of my baby. The scan was on a Friday, so they scheduled the D/C for Monday. The day before my younger boy’s 6th birthday. It was tough to be smiling the next day! He knew about the pregnancy (and all of his preschool as he can’t keep secrets) as did his older brother. But the kids seem to handling this kind of thing a lot easier. 
The D/C is now 4 weeks and 2 days ago. The feeling to be pregnant had been lingering for about 3 weeks but especially the last 4 or 5 days I feel almost “normal”. If a women can ever feel normal as always dependent on where she is in her cycle… I found mucus the last days when I wiped. Not every time. I do lose my mucus plug before ovulation, so I wonder if I am about to O. I wonder if I should take advantage of it? I am 3 months older since I got pregnant and it is not getting better. But I am afraid to risk another miscarriage if we try to early. I did an hcg Test this morning and it was negative but it was not the most sensitive (20 whatever the unit is). I did an OPK this afternoon but I only used OPKs one cycle (the one I got pregnant in) and I am unsure if it is negative or positive as I don’t have a dark line. But I think I don’t ever get a very dark line. Whatever, I guess O is to come and my next appointment with my RE is next week on Wednesday. I am rather sure that O is over then. So I can’t wait to ask her if it is ok to start again or if there are any issues…
What do you think? When did you start again. It is really awful to be in such a hurry and I wish we could take our time. Right now I don’t even know if I won’t be completely hysteric when I am pregnant again as I will be so sure that it won’t last anyway and if it then really doesn’t last (the next pregnancy that I don’t even have yet) then it will be really to late to get pregnant as I don’t want to be 42 when #3 is born. So yes, I want to start trying NOW. I am really happy if you tell me your story about how you started again!

I have two little boys, and this was my third pregnancy. Baby's due date had been pushed back a week at my 7 week dating U/S (not unusual for me), but baby's growth just kept getting further and further behind. I had ""spotting"" (that in hindsight we now think was actually me losing my mucous plug) starting around June 30. On Thursday last week I had an u/s around 10:30am and everything looked good expect Baby should've been measuring around 13 weeks and was only around 11w. He was also in a really odd position, so they weren't sure if it was just an odd position or indicative of a structural (chromosonal issue). Later that night, I could feel myself go into labor, Baby was born (can I say that? I hate the more clinical term for it) around 5:15am. This was a surprise (the timing) pregnancy, but very much wanted. It was just a beautiful icing on the cake/completing our family thing for us. I'm really sad, really really sad, but have had great support from friend's and healthcare providers which I'm grateful for. So I'm sad, but I'm afloat if that makes sense. Like all of us here I'm sure, I had plans and so many dreams for my family and this baby. My kids would've all been exactly the same age apart, and we would've had one in each season (except summer!). Several (FIVE, FIVE!!!!) of my friends are pregnant and due within 2 weeks of each other/my EDD. I'm really mourning not being on this journey with them anymore. Which makes me feel like a superficial jerk. 

Our midwives encouraged us to take about 3 months to start trying again, so I did not get any guidance yet on how to proceed. We're undecided. Part of me wants to me pregnant again as soon as possible. Part of me was so wed to the idea of my January baby that I want to wait...for what seems like forever to try again. Part of me thinks, hey, maybe take more than 4 days to decide what you're doing? In the interest of having some control over things and the luxury of doing whatever I want, I went ahead and ordered some cheapie pregnancy tests and ovulation test strips. What's the protocol for this? A friend mentioned that you take pregnancy tests until they're negative to show that your hCg is down? I will probably call my midwives next week to ask a few questions, but am curious about what other's experiences have been. At 13 weeks, is my hCg level over the range for a HPT? what should I expect here? 

ETA: I had no morning sickness with this pregnancy and a few of my ""usual"" pregnancy symptoms were noticeably absent. I've already banned myself from reading/googling about no morning sickness/link with mc, but anyone else experience this? Plan to ask my midwives about this as well.

Miscarried naturally over the next 4 days. No one other than my DH knew I was pregnant at the time. I wasn't even done bleeding when the first insensitive comment happened. 

The first comment came from one of my best friends in the area. I didn't tell her about the pregnancy or miscarriage because I didn't think she would understand. She had left a few things at our place the previous weekend and came by after work to pick them up. She asked to use the bathroom and I told her I needed a moment to check and make sure it was acceptable for guests since I had been sick earlier that week. By ""sick"" I meant bleeding profusely out of my uterus, but I didn't feel like sharing with her. Her response? ""Are you pregnant!?!?!"" To which I coldly said ""no."" She went to the bathroom, and I went upstairs to cry asking my husband to go help her with her items. That was on Friday. 

Saturday, my neighbor asked when we were giving her daughter a friend to play with. It was in the evening, after dark, so she couldn't really see my expression. My DH quickly changed the subject and I excused myself to the bathroom to cry. 

I went an entire week without anyone asking about the status of my uterus, then it happened again. I was at a birthday party for a friend. I was originally nervous about hiding my lack of drinking at this party, but I'm not pregnant anymore, so I had a few drinks. After the party ended, we were still there with 3 close friends. She mentioned that she noticed all of the girls from college (3 of us) were drinking at the party and made a mental note that none of us were pregnant. I was so upset, because I SHOULD have been pregnant. I excused myself. DH followed me and held me while I cried in the other room. 

All I want is to be pregnant again. I hate having to attend these stupid events where I had planned to be pregnant with my empty uterus. We have another group function this weekend I had planned to be pregnant at. I had planned to announce the first weekend of August at our annual BBQ. We were going to announce on facebook on our anniversary later that month. I am now dreading all of these events. They are just reminders that I'm not pregnant anymore and I don't want to celebrate them. If I could cancel everything until I am pregnant again, I would, but that's not really feasible. This sucks.

When did you schedule your first OB appointment after getting a BFP?  When I saw my new OB about 1.5 weeks ago, he had asked if my 4 CPs were ever confirmed with a blood test and/or sonogram/ultrasound (forgot the term he used).  When I later went for a full vaginal sonogram at the OB's referral the receptionist who checked me in asked the same thing about the CPs.  The technician who did the scan itself asked if my doctor was able to get any testing done on the miscarried material.  The answer to all these questions was ""No, because there wasn't enough time between getting my first BFP and when the bleeding started to schedule an OB appointment, let alone have anyone collect any of the material.""

So, going forward I want to be more proactive and schedule an appointment as soon as possible so if it happens again there will be an official record, but I also don't want to come across as crazy.  I'm 9dpo and 5 days until my period is scheduled to start.  I haven't taken a pregnancy test yet because I don't want to be disappointed *again* (ether it's just a BFN or a BFP that turns into a BFN in a few days), but I also want to so I'll know whether to schedule an appointment.  But on that note, when *should* I make these appointments for?  Literally ASAP, or some time after my period is due to start?  After 4 CPs that I only know about due to home pregnancy tests and consistent symptoms, I'm feeling kind of anxious about seeing someone ASAP but worry I'll come across as being unnecessarily aggressive.

(An aside about aggressive behaviors, I had forgotten to ask my OB about progesterone during my appointment itself and he was seeing other patients by the time I remembered, so I asked the receptionist at my OB's office if she could pass a message to him about whether it would be worth it for me to get a prescription for progesterone, ""just in case low progesterone is the reason for all my CPs.""

It seems my general anaesthetic has completely fucked up my cycle and even though I'm 6 days over due my period I'm definitely not pregnant (tested yesterday). I had taken a break from temping this month. Now I'm completely screwed, don't know when my period is due and totally devastated because I actually got kind of excited as I was so late. This is officially my longest cycle ever. 

I'm abroad with my inlaws, husband and toddler to attend a wedding this weekend. Found out unexpectedly yesterday that not only is the bride pregnant, her due date is almost the same as mine. What was a happy holiday is being ruined by my stupid no show period and irrational irritation about the pregnancy which everyone is talking about. My mother in law even asked me to work out when she would be due and how far along she is. I'm like, seriously, do you not recognise the date? I'm still not pregnant again even though we've hit my fertile period every cycle (except this one when i didn't temp). I've never made it to cycle 3 before when actively trying (and I know thats very lucky but it doesn't make me feel better).. My body just seems to hate me

On top of that I just got called a troll on the facebook miscarriage group I was part of.

I was here looking for answers on what to do so I wanted post in case others are in a similar situation. WARNING - COULD BE TMI IF YOU'RE SQUEAMISH. I tried to be detailed. 

I got the confirmation at an imaging center the morning after my doctor appointment. The embryo stopped growing around 7 weeks and my body had just not recognized that it wasn't viable. There was no heartbeat. My doctor's office was amazing. They had the results put in as STAT and I got a call while I was at the imaging center. They had me go directly to their office even though it was past their closing time. They gave me a Mifeprex in the office and then 200mg of misoprostol (4 tablets) to be inserted 24 hours later. As I understand it, the first pill suppresses the pregnancy hormones and the misoprostol induces dilation and cramping. My doctor emphasized that a missed miscarriage and a natural miscarriage are the same thing. I would've had a natural miscarriage eventually, but because of technology we caught it earlier. Sometimes it just takes the body time to recognize the lack of viability. 

When I inserted the misoprostol yesterday I ended up falling asleep for a few hours (I was instructed to lay down for 30 minutes after insertion) and about a half hour after I stood up I started bleeding. The cramps were like heavy period cramps. I took an ibuprofen and that helped significantly, but I barely ever use medicine so I could see maybe wanting something stronger if you do. I basically just spent the evening pacing around because the walking also helped to decrease the discomfort and being upright facilitated the evacuation. I passed a lot of solid tissue and what I think was the sack within 10 hours of inserting the misoprostol. That part is gross, but not really painful. It kind of just comes out without any effort or permission. I spent a lot of time on the toilet, but I preferred walking around with a pad on. 

It's been 19 hours since inserting misoprostol and the bleeding is moderate. Like a heavy period. I'm not sure how long to expect solid tissue to pass, but it seems like the worst is probably over. I really wished I had a first hand experience to refer to when I was making the decision to have a D&C or take the pills, so that's why I wanted to post my personal experience. Obviously it can be very different for different people, but this is what happened for me. I go back to get an ultrasound to make sure everything was cleared on Tuesday. 

Emotionally I was not extremely attached to this baby yet because our pregnancy happened so quickly, I didn't have a lot of symptoms, and I never heard a heartbeat. I think if you were really attached it could be a bit traumatic to experience this at home. That being said I personally appreciated the planned and controlled nature of it. Although the medicine was not covered by insurance (it's experimental in the US I guess, stupid...) and I paid $180, so far less than surgery would be. 

Again thanks to this community (specifically the Feb Bumpers sub) for the outpouring of support and if you're reading this because you have to make this terrible decision, my deepest condolences.

----
One year ago today I signed up for reddit and stopped being an Internet lurker about my miscarriage because of this subreddit. I created an intro post where I finally was able to write out the guilt and sadness I was still feeling about my loss, my body and the events that surrounded my miscarriage. 

What happened next amazed me: /u/notamyrtle and /u/pigwin and /u/ittybittybit and /u/therealamberrose and /u/greenmangosfool and /u/benthebull and /u/cowgirljenn and /u/hopeitlasts commented on my intro post to help me see that I wasn't alone and that while my feelings of shame and guilt were unfounded, they were also ones that so many of us contend with. They showed me I wasn't a freak because I had a miscarriage and I wasn't a freak because of what I was thinking about it. 

They helped me see that there was nothing wrong with me for feeling the way I did and that my loss wasn't something to just ""bingo"" away with tired platitudes. Before my post I had only heard things like ""it was just like a heavy period,"" ""it was a good sign you can become pg,"" and ""patience"" from my  family members and even my ob/gyn. Those words hurt so much when I was still waking up in the middle of each night wracked with sobs and pain. They made me feel like I was mourning ""nothing"" - that I was overreacting to the bad and being pessimistic instead of optimistic. The users on TTCAL recognized that I was mourning a real loss that mattered. 

What blew me away the most is that these users helped me understand all this at the same time they were (and many currently are still) undergoing their own paths with conceiving or being pregnant after loss or waiting to try or not trying to conceive. Since then, so many users continue to amaze me with their capacity to hold me in their thoughts as they struggle themselves. 

I think about how much I've grown since even a year ago in my understanding about loss and my own fertility. A year ago I thought the only way that I would be happy to be alive is that if I were pregnant or given birth by this time. I couldn't even picture a future without being pregnant by this time. 

Through the help of this board, I've come to realize some things that have really helped me. I use the words ""try to"" below a lot because I'm not some great enlightened being... I'm just human and I'm trying still a year later. 

- I try to focus now on the fertility choices that change and arise before me (however few they may be or seem) instead of a set fertility timeline or lost timelines. It's the only way I can remember that at any time I do have choices open to me - even if it's the choice to stop TTC. 

- I try to not get mad at myself when I do focus on timelines. I let myself think about and imagine the six-month-old who ""should"" be here today, but I try not to use those imaginings as a weapon against myself. I know these imaginings are a way to honor what could have been and that's okay. 

- I try to focus on what is to be gained by these choices and processes (becoming a parent someday) and recognize that goal is weighty and hard enough instead of focusing on what I've lost or can never have in the process (a ""naive/carefree"" pregnancy, conceiving ""naturally"" without ART, having a definite ""answer"" as to how my tubes became useless, etc.). 

- I try to focus on the relationships and people that have the capacity to understand and try to focus less on wishing that emotionally stunted/uncomfortable people in my life would understand. I try to focus on saying (even if it's in my head) ""I'm disappointed in you and it's not my job to educate you as to why what you're saying/doing/not doing isn't okay"" over wishing people were different. 

- I try to remember that social media is an often distorted picture of people's lives that offers an incredibly limited register for expressing pregnancy loss (and other major life challenges/events) and I find that it plays far less of a role in my life today than it did a year ago. 

- I try to remember that healing isn't forgetting or no longer feeling deeply about my loss. A year later I'm not only not pregnant, but I'm tubeless and I still think about and sometimes cry about my mc. There are great days, but there are also really shitty days still. I've come to realize it's never been about getting ""over it,"" and it's always been about understanding where I am THAT day, what's impacting me, and how I'm feeling about it. Healing is about opening up spaces in that raw emotion to listen to it and respect it, about trying to cultivate self-reflection and awareness about what I'm feeling, not about trying to push the feeling away or wait for an arbitrary measure of time or action to show me I'm ""healed."" In short, for me there is no being ""healed,"" there is just the process of ""healing."" 

Thank you TTCAL. As we often say on here and the infertility board - this is an incredible group of people who've had to come together under incredibly shitty circumstances we wouldn't wish on our worst enemies. I know my loss changed me irrevocably, but I also know this board has changed me too and for the better.

Husband and I are private people so aside from one work-friend who I trust to not blab, my husband, and my obgyn, I haven't told anyone else about them or that we are TTC.  I don't know if my husband had mentioned it to any of his friends, though it seems he hasn't.  We both agreed to not tell our families about these losses or any future pregnancies until at least week 8. He sees no point in disappointing his parents with bad news after the fact; I fear my well-intentioned-but-overbearing parents will be judgemental about my lifestyle and pry about treatments, my doctor appointments, etc., and stress me out even more.

After all these months of holding this in I now have the urge to confide in specifically two of my friends about the losses.  I don't think I'm necessarily looking for support, I just… want to talk about it sometimes. Maybe that's the same as support.  Anyway, right now it feels like I'm hiding a big bad shameful secret when it is simply a life experience.  I trust these two friends to not gossip should I ask them not to so I'm not worried about that.  I *am* worried that should either of them become expectant mothers in the near future, they may avoid telling me out of consideration that the news might be upsetting, even if I emphasize that I have no problems being around pregnant women or babies.  And yes, while it would sting initially (especially if I still haven't managed to keep a pregnancy by then), I would rather just deal with the emotions upfront than to find out later on that I was excluded *and* have to deal with the emotions anyway.

What are your experiences with this?  Any advice on how to approach the decision?  If I do decide to tell these friends should I run it by my husband first?

93,2048,confidence,<praw.reddit.Reddit object at 0x7f12a630cd90>,,ttcafterloss,"Had first appointment with a new obgyn yesterday.  We went through my and my family's medical history, I told him about my PCOS diagnosis as a teenager although my periods became regular as of ~10 years ago.

When I mentioned the four CPs, he asked if they were confirmed with ultrasound/HCG numbers at a doctor's, and I explained that I only saw a doctor after the first CP where she drew a blood test, but she didn't call me about the results.  I didn't bother with the subsequent CPs because they all ended at around 4 weeks--which didn't leave much of any time between getting a BFP and scheduling an appointment--and it was really inconvenient to get to her office.  I ""knew"" I was pregnant from home pregnancy tests that went from positive to negative plus symptoms, then bleeding started.  After that discussion, I felt like maybe I still should have seen a doctor about them, but it just felt so futile at the time.

The initial physical examination suggested everything was OK, but he took two vials of blood and referred me for an ultrasound scan to rule out physical deformities in the uterus and also for genetic counseling.  Blood tests results should be coming back next week, I should get a call from the genetic counselors people in that time as well to match me with a counselor that takes my insurance, and I'll just need to call to make the ultrasound appointment.

I asked if we should wait on TTC this month, and he said he didn't want to tell us no in case chance would have it that this month we are successful in keeping a pregnancy.  Plus if we're going to wait this month, we would probably want to consider waiting until the results are back from the genetic counseling.  So with the information we have now--which really is only that I've had repeated consecutive losses--he sees no compelling reason for us to wait.

In one of my previous posts a few people had suggested that low progesterone could be the cause.  I asked about it and he said while that is true, I'm at the wrong stage of my cycle to test for it.

So right now it's a bit of a waiting game, but I already feel a lot better being referred to for scanning, testing, and to specialists.

We went through my and my family&#39;s medical history, I told him about my PCOS diagnosis as a teenager although my periods became regular as of ~10 years ago.</p>

<p>When I mentioned the four CPs, he asked if they were confirmed with ultrasound/HCG numbers at a doctor&#39;s, and I explained that I only saw a doctor after the first CP where she drew a blood test, but she didn&#39;t call me about the results.  I didn&#39;t bother with the subsequent CPs because they all ended at around 4 weeks--which didn&#39;t leave much of any time between getting a BFP and scheduling an appointment--and it was really inconvenient to get to her office.  I &quot;knew&quot; I was pregnant from home pregnancy tests that went from positive to negative plus symptoms, then bleeding started.  After that discussion, I felt like maybe I still should have seen a doctor about them, but it just felt so futile at the time.</p>

<p>The initial physical examination suggested everything was OK, but he took two vials of blood and referred me for an ultrasound scan to rule out physical deformities in the uterus and also for genetic counseling.  Blood tests results should be coming back next week, I should get a call from the genetic counselors people in that time as well to match me with a counselor that takes my insurance, and I&#39;ll just need to call to make the ultrasound appointment.</p>

<p>I asked if we should wait on TTC this month, and he said he didn&#39;t want to tell us no in case chance would have it that this month we are successful in keeping a pregnancy.  Plus if we&#39;re going to wait this month, we would probably want to consider waiting until the results are back from the genetic counseling.  So with the information we have now--which really is only that I&#39;ve had repeated consecutive losses--he sees no compelling reason for us to wait.</p>

Basically therapist clarified (because I'm too ridiculous to even know what's going on in my own body) that I'm upset over my grandmother dying. Which I knew, but couldn't get a handle on why I was still upset, or so upset. But she was very important to me. She's the woman I believed deep down did love me unconditionally. And I regret so much that I didn't tell her about how we were having such a rough time with TTC. Her first born was a stillborn. And I didn't want to upset her and bring back sad memories.... But I regret not opening myself to her so that she could say ""oh Ben"" and hug me and rock me and make me feel like it really was going to be okay someday. I am missing and will continue to miss her hugs so much. I miss her so much. And I'm so sad that my children won't get to have met her, known her. She wasn't perfect, she had her flaws but god she meant a lot to me. Our relationship was a very special one to me and I really do feel the loss, the emptiness of her passing.

I've also been reading the tradition Chinese medicine book called ""curing infertility"", and trying to absorb the last chapter about how it's important to know when to quit. I don't think we're there yet. Or, I don't think I'm there yet. 

And then I got upset because I realized I'm reading about when to quit TTC, and I don't think my husband has read a single thing about helping TTC from a male perspective.

103,2048,confidence,<praw.reddit.Reddit object at 0x7f12a630cd90>,,ttcafterloss,"Good morning ladies. I've been lurking for a few days now and finally decided to introduce myself. I'm Rachel! I'm 28, and my husband is 27. I have one son, who turns 7 next month, from a previous relationship. So we were/are trying for my number 2 and his number 1. 

I had my last injection of the depo shot in September 2015, and we were NTNP until I got my period back in August 2016 and then we actively started trying. We successfully conceived on cycle 8 and we were so excited! Went for my first ultrasound at 6w2d and baby was measuring exactly on track and had a heartbeat of 114. We felt confident enough to announce to all of our friends and family, and then to Facebook about it. Which I regret now, but I am glad for the support I am receiving. Last Thursday, I went for just a regular appointment with my doctor at 9w4d. My husband had just left town for a bachelor party 10 hours away so I went by myself. During a surprise ultrasound we discovered that there was no heartbeat and the baby was measuring at 9 weeks exactly so it had just happened. I'd had no spotting or bleeding, and was still having normal symptoms. 

I was completely blindsided. And to have to find out alone was even worse. My husband got the first flight home he was able to and hasn't left my side this whole time. He's been my rock. I had my D&C on Tuesday and all went as planned and my doctor is sending the fetus off for genetic testing to see if my chromosomal abnormality could be what caused this. 

My husband and I talked to the doctor, and have decided to start trying again immediately. Sorry for the long backstory. 

Now for my questions... For those of you who have had a D&C done, how long until you started your period after the procedure? 

How long did it take for your hcg levels to go down to zero? 

Is it okay for me to start vaginally temping again now, or do I need to wait until the two weeks after the D&C? 

Any help is appreciated, and I'm so glad to have found this community! I feel less alone now.

I&#39;ve been lurking for a few days now and finally decided to introduce myself. I&#39;m Rachel! I&#39;m 28, and my husband is 27. I have one son, who turns 7 next month, from a previous relationship. So we were/are trying for my number 2 and his number 1. </p>

<p>I had my last injection of the depo shot in September 2015, and we were NTNP until I got my period back in August 2016 and then we actively started trying. We successfully conceived on cycle 8 and we were so excited! Went for my first ultrasound at 6w2d and baby was measuring exactly on track and had a heartbeat of 114. We felt confident enough to announce to all of our friends and family, and then to Facebook about it. Which I regret now, but I am glad for the support I am receiving. Last Thursday, I went for just a regular appointment with my doctor at 9w4d. My husband had just left town for a bachelor party 10 hours away so I went by myself. During a surprise ultrasound we discovered that there was no heartbeat and the baby was measuring at 9 weeks exactly so it had just happened. I&#39;d had no spotting or bleeding, and was still having normal symptoms. </p>

<p>I was completely blindsided. And to have to find out alone was even worse. My husband got the first flight home he was able to and hasn&#39;t left my side this whole time. He&#39;s been my rock. I had my D&amp;C on Tuesday and all went as planned and my doctor is sending the fetus off for genetic testing to see if my chromosomal abnormality could be what caused this. </p>

<p>My husband and I talked to the doctor, and have decided to start trying again immediately. Sorry for the long backstory. </p>

<p>Now for my questions... For those of you who have had a D&amp;C done, how long until you started your period after the procedure? </p>

<p>How long did it take for your hcg levels to go down to zero? </p>

<p>Is it okay for me to start vaginally temping again now, or do I need to wait until the two weeks after the D&amp;C? </p>

I lost my baby on Saturday at 15w4d; I chose to be induced so that I could meet/hold my baby. It was a girl, what I had wanted so badly - we named her Stella Rose. Here is my (long) story...

My fiance and I had been sort of trying for almost a year, when we got serious last December and I downloaded Fertility Friend to track my BBT and also started losing weight using MFP (myfitness pal). In 4 months, I lost close to 45 lbs and my periods began to regulate - in April, I found out I was pregnant. I was in disbelief, but overjoyed! My pregnancy was un-eventful at first, no morning sickness, constipation or any other inconvenient symptoms. I had been running since I started losing weight, but began to limit myself to run/walk as I was trying to keep my heart rate below 160 which was almost impossible in the heat. I had registered for a 5K race in June which I wasn't sure about, but i went ahead and participated... just mainly run/walking then sprinting at the end. This was at about 10w3d.

Cut to 11 weeks pregnant, I got home from work and went to the bathroom - wiped - blood. Cue: panic! Called my fiance and we went to the ER. In retrospect, this was just some spotting so I definitely could have just gone to my clinic the following day.. however the ER did diagnose a UTI and we saw the baby jumping around with a healthy heartbeat. I got some antibiotics and was on my way instructed to follow up at my clinic that Friday.

Fridays follow up was with a t/v ultrasound, baby was fine and cervix was closed - instructed to finish antibiotics. Then over the weekend the bleeding worsened to red in color and more than spotting. I went back on the following Monday to my OBGYN and he referred me to a Maternal Fetal Medicine clinic, baby was still doing fine at this time but he spoke those words.... ""threatened miscarriage"" which are awful to hear.

Overnight the bleeding increased a lot, to the point that we were convinced the baby was lost - we mourned our baby and just cried in bed waiting for our appointment with the specialist later in the day. Again, baby was doing great on the u/s at the specialist - fluid levels were great, and baby was strong. They diagnosed me with a subchorionic hematoma (not on the placenta side). I was told the chance of miscarriage was now higher but not by much, and instructed to take it somewhat easy, pelvic rest, and to come back in 3 weeks for a check.

The bleeding slowed and turned to brown over the next weeks, I was feeling positive but still scared. I went home to visit my family over the 4th of July, but the bleeding had come back a little bit - mainly just a bit more red than before which I noted but tried not to panic. The specialist doctor told us the signs to look for would be intense bent-over pain, or hemhorrage (i.e. filling 2 pads/hour) and I was no where near either of those. For 2 days while I was visiting family, there was NO bleeding.... but I noticed my pad was slightly wet... which I tried to push to the back of my head but the fear lingered. Then after some dinner one night, I felt a gush - a big gush. Rushed to the bathroom and had completely filled a pad in 1 minute - was so scared. We were 5 states away from our Doctors and this did not seem normal. I cried all night as we contemplated what to do. By the morning the bleeding had somewhat slowed, we decided we could make it to our 15w appointment back home in 2 days and try to relax.

Over those 2 days I was miserable in fear, I knew something was very wrong - but my fiance tried to stay positive. We got back home and went to that appointment... the ultrasound tech found the heartbeat but was very quiet, I asked about fluid and she said ""not much fluid"" you could tell the baby could not move, it was terrible. I knew something was so wrong, but I held on hope as there was still a heartbeat...

The doctor came in and told us our options... basically, there was no fluid, not a drop. The baby's lungs cannot develop without fluid, and at that point we were just in a waiting game for the baby to pass. We decided on induction, as now my health was at risk due to no fluid and the possibility of infection of my uterus. This was on a Thursday afternoon, they scheduled the induction for Friday at 5pm. I treasured the last day with my baby living inside me, we spent some time walking around the University hospital gardens in the hours before the induction, which brought some peace - but my heart was completely broken.

They induced me that night, the hospital doctors and nurses took such good care of me. I gave birth overnight to my baby girl, Stella Rose, and she was perfect. We got to hold her and touch her, and take pictures; and I will treasure that forever. Unfortunately they had issues getting my placenta out which left me extremely nauseous for much of that time. I am struggling with some regrets of not holding her for longer, but I was holding a puke bucket most of that time.

It was hard to leave the hospital as that is where I had to leave my baby, it has only been 4 days since I gave birth - and I am healing physically, but I know the emotional healing will take much longer. My milk came in yesterday, so I am longing to nurse my baby and so sad that I cannot. I feel empty in my womb, and I long for my baby. I want my baby to matter, but I fear so many will just view this as a mc that I need to move on from (not that MC are easy by any means to move on from but there is the societal view that they are, which is awful). I know this was a mc, but since I gave birth and the baby was alive the day before - it feels different. I am caught in a sort of limbo of thoughts about how everything went down, and how to think/talk about my loss in the future. Technically this was not a stillborn as the baby was only 15w, but I also have a hard time thinking of this as a termination as we just did what was medically necessary. To me it seemed the baby was totally healthy, and it was a spontaneous membrane rupture probably due to infection after weeks of bleeding... but I may never know. They did send the placenta for testing so that may give me answers eventually but I am aware I may never have an answer.

We want to start trying again right away, but I know the next pregnancy (if I am so lucky) will be filled with anxiety and fear. I had passed the ""safe zone"" with the last one, yet still lost my baby. We are attending a support group at the hospital clinic tomorrow, and I have taken this week off work - but I am having anxiety about returning. There is a gal I work with who is due 4 days after I was due (which was Christmas). I fear the holidays now as I will have to deal with Stella's due-date and will always remember on Christmas that I should have my baby. Sometimes I feel like the only thing that will make me happy again will be to get pregnant quickly, and this thought process scares me also because I realize this is probably unhealthy and also it puts a lot of pressure on myself.

This was a lot of rambling, I needed to get this out somewhere so thanks for reading. I plan to start trying right away, so will be around here a lot more. Once my bleeding stops, I plan to upgrade my FF again to VIP and start tracking BBT. This seems like an amazing community, so thank you for having me.

Then after some dinner one night, I felt a gush - a big gush. Rushed to the bathroom and had completely filled a pad in 1 minute - was so scared. We were 5 states away from our Doctors and this did not seem normal. I cried all night as we contemplated what to do. By the morning the bleeding had somewhat slowed, we decided we could make it to our 15w appointment back home in 2 days and try to relax.</p>

<p>Over those 2 days I was miserable in fear, I knew something was very wrong - but my fiance tried to stay positive. We got back home and went to that appointment... the ultrasound tech found the heartbeat but was very quiet, I asked about fluid and she said &quot;not much fluid&quot; you could tell the baby could not move, it was terrible. I knew something was so wrong, but I held on hope as there was still a heartbeat...</p>

<p>The doctor came in and told us our options... basically, there was no fluid, not a drop. The baby&#39;s lungs cannot develop without fluid, and at that point we were just in a waiting game for the baby to pass. We decided on induction, as now my health was at risk due to no fluid and the possibility of infection of my uterus. This was on a Thursday afternoon, they scheduled the induction for Friday at 5pm. I treasured the last day with my baby living inside me, we spent some time walking around the University hospital gardens in the hours before the induction, which brought some peace - but my heart was completely broken.</p>

<p>They induced me that night, the hospital doctors and nurses took such good care of me. I gave birth overnight to my baby girl, Stella Rose, and she was perfect. We got to hold her and touch her, and take pictures; and I will treasure that forever. Unfortunately they had issues getting my placenta out which left me extremely nauseous for much of that time. I am struggling with some regrets of not holding her for longer, but I was holding a puke bucket most of that time.</p>

<p>It was hard to leave the hospital as that is where I had to leave my baby, it has only been 4 days since I gave birth - and I am healing physically, but I know the emotional healing will take much longer. My milk came in yesterday, so I am longing to nurse my baby and so sad that I cannot. I feel empty in my womb, and I long for my baby. I want my baby to matter, but I fear so many will just view this as a mc that I need to move on from (not that MC are easy by any means to move on from but there is the societal view that they are, which is awful). I know this was a mc, but since I gave birth and the baby was alive the day before - it feels different. I am caught in a sort of limbo of thoughts about how everything went down, and how to think/talk about my loss in the future. Technically this was not a stillborn as the baby was only 15w, but I also have a hard time thinking of this as a termination as we just did what was medically necessary. To me it seemed the baby was totally healthy, and it was a spontaneous membrane rupture probably due to infection after weeks of bleeding... but I may never know. They did send the placenta for testing so that may give me answers eventually but I am aware I may never have an answer.</p>

<p>We want to start trying again right away, but I know the next pregnancy (if I am so lucky) will be filled with anxiety and fear. I had passed the &quot;safe zone&quot; with the last one, yet still lost my baby. We are attending a support group at the hospital clinic tomorrow, and I have taken this week off work - but I am having anxiety about returning. There is a gal I work with who is due 4 days after I was due (which was Christmas). I fear the holidays now as I will have to deal with Stella&#39;s due-date and will always remember on Christmas that I should have my baby. Sometimes I feel like the only thing that will make me happy again will be to get pregnant quickly, and this thought process scares me also because I realize this is probably unhealthy and also it puts a lot of pressure on myself.</p>

<p>This was a lot of rambling, I needed to get this out somewhere so thanks for reading. I plan to start trying right away, so will be around here a lot more. Once my bleeding stops, I plan to upgrade my FF again to VIP and start tracking BBT. This seems like an amazing community, so thank you for having me. </p>

I've followed this sub for awhile now, and I think it's time for me to introduce myself. I'm 29 years old, and my husband and I started ttc January 2017.

I have been lurking for a few days. My pregnancy is in the process of ending with medical management. I had a blighted ovum (empty gestational sac that continued to grow, but was only at 5w6d when my LMP was dating me at 9weeks, slow growth confirmed by multiple ultrasounds).

I have a Drs appt Tuesday. I'm 24 years old and this was my first pregnancy. I want to try again right away but I don't know how I feel about trying without doing something differently.

I am worried the doctor is going to tell me it was just bad luck and it is unlikely for a BO to occur again. I just feel deep down there is an underlying issue. Am I just being negative? Is it just overwhelmingly likely that I had bad luck?

What are your thoughts on progesterone? Should I ask for it? Test for thyroid issues? MTHR? Should I take baby asprin just in case? I have a symptom indication that I have low progesterone (brown spotting before my period every cycle). Underactive thyriods run in my family and I have been chronically fatigued since I was 19 (though I never sought treatment for it). I also think I'm a bit of a hypochondriac and those things may be nothing.

What are your thoughts? Should I push for testing? Should I be a good patient and just try again without intervention if that is what the doctor says?

No one wants to have another miscarriage, and I'm sure statistics support the idea of not testing after your first, but one is really too many.

I've been having a bit of a strained relationship with my younger SIL. I'll try to keep it short, but she met husband, married, and got pregnant in less than 2 years. She straight up told me she didn't want kids for a long time, but guess what happened 1 month later.

She announced at Christmas, which was less than one week past my should have been due date. It was so unexpected that my husband and I had to hide away for an hour. The inlaws asked if everything was alright which made us tell them about our loss. We figured that they would be courteous around us, knowing what was up.

I guess not, because SIL didn't seem to remember or care. She straight up asked my husband to paint her nursery. She also spent Mothers day sewing cloth diapers in front of us. I feel like she has never even cared to ask how we are doing.

I started slowly going on social media blackout closer to her due date. Then on June 2nd, I got another positive test. Unfortunately I lost it again. We told the parent inlaws and they basically gave us the cliche ""just relax"". They have never been great with support or asking how we are doing.

SIL had baby June 27th. She was texting my husband while she was in labour, but never actually told him she was in labour. We only found out the next morning when FIL texted us. She hasn't reached out or contacted me in any way since before the birth. Any new information was sent to only my husband via group text. 

She asked us to drive 3 hours to her place to meet the baby on the 30th. We declined saying we were busy but all the other SIL went. MIL and FIL have been there for the last 11 days.

_____________________________________________

Today I feel like I reached a point where I could finally look at her facebook to see pic, but I find I still get really sad/angry/jealous/bitter feelings. Part of me wants to meet up only because I love babies, but I'm also really afraid that I am not ready to do it. I didn't want to meet with MIL around anyways (for long story reasons). I figured we could put it off until we are ready.

However our whole next 2 months are completely filled up on weekends. This Saturday is our only free weekend until the end of August. Logically, if we are going to rip the bandaid, it has to be this week, but MIL will be there and I am a mess of emotions.

I know that I should wait until ready, but I also have this crazy fear that they are pissed at us for not being super happy and supportive. If we don't go visit for 2 months, I worry that they will grow bitter and angry at us (even though it is the other way around). SIL is the golden child so I'm sure inlaws will take her side. Other SIL already gave us some mild shit for not sucking it up and going with her. Husband is coming to terms with the fact that his family runs away when we have real emotional problems, but I don't want to cause more strain because of my feelings.

Sorry for this mess of a post. I hope it makes a tiny bit of sense.

That broke my heart to hear. This sub was what saved me when I lost my infant son, and got me through TTC again,  prenatal depression, a psych ward stay, grief, good days, terrible days, morbid humour when I needed it, and friends. 

So, if anyone reading this has lost an infant (or toddler, child), you can always reach out to any of the mods or myself. We do care and there is a place for you here. You don't have to feel like you can't post what you want because the miscarriage and stillbirth stories are different, and that no one gets it. I do. And I know there are others as well.

 Reach out if you need, any time. PM me, I may be asleep at that time but I'm on every day. Need to post a rambling mess of emotion in a moment of despair late at night? I'm that person to message, because I've been there and have done that and understand that hell.

Also, if anyone sees someone post about infant loss, feel free to let me know so I can pop in to talk to them.
