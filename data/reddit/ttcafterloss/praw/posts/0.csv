My husband and I are both 31 and had our first loss in the fall of 2013 after unexpectedly getting pregnant. It was early, so the physical symptoms were not too bad. But even with it being an unplanned pregnancy, we were devastated. After that, we started actively trying to get pregnant and were finally successful again in September 2014. We'd had an amazing summer (lots of travel, honeymoon in Greece...GREECE!) so the pregnancy seemed meant to be.

My body thought otherwise and it turned out to be an ectopic pregnancy. Just after I hit the 5 week mark, I started spotting. After having a miscarriage before, I was a wreck about it. But, my hcg continued to double so the nurse practitioner I saw wanted to wait a week to do an ultrasound because it was too early. Three days later, I was in the ER with a ruptured fallopian tube. Bonus--during surgery, the doctor found that I have endometriosis.

So now here we are, trying again. We're seeing an RE now and our tests have turned out pretty normal. My left tube is open and I do ovulate every month. I have a genetic abnormality that can cause clotting issues and possibly repeated early miscarriage, so I've been taking baby aspirin. The spot of good news I have to share this month is that Friday we found out that I am ovulating from both ovaries, so maybe that's a good sign?

Anyway, about us outside of our glum reproductive prospects-my husband works in the oilfields in North Dakota, so we spend a bit of time apart while he works. I'm not working at the moment, but earned my Master's in education last May. (We'd been preparing to move when the ectopic happened, hence why I wasn't working.) We have a 5 month old puppy who keeps us busy and entertained. We're both nerds and huge readers. Anyway, I'll shut up (English major, so I get wordy).

A month later I was pregnant and we thought god had finally smiled on our family. Turns out not so much...

I just had a follow up appointment today with my ob/gyn, and today I started my first period after the miscarriage. Basically, the story goes that my DH and I were trying actively for five cycles with no luck. At the beginning of November, we were both relieved to find we both wanted to take an indefinite break from trying to get our finances and life together more than we have already. So I did everything in the book, drank excessively, ate poorly, basically threw caution to the wind. 

As you know the story goes, we had a drunken, unprotected escapade and were shell shocked on 12/17 to get a positive digital pregnancy test. Well, after we took 24 hours to process it, and I resumed the mindset of the woman who'd been desperately trying to conceive the 5 months prior, I woke up the next day to a ball of anxiety. 

I started bleeding, went to the doctor and they confirmed my HCG was so low, they didn't need to do any intervention. I cried all day long and really am still trying to figure out what this means. I'm a little concerned since I had the appointment with my doctor today and he told me how he when I get a positive test next time, I need to come in right away for beta testing and come in for an ultrasound at 6 weeks instead of 8... 

Anyhow, we've decided to wait almost another year to start TTC again but I'm already feeling such a *yearning* for this baby. I bought a couple cute baby onesies the other day and feel like a crazy woman when I periodically take them out and look at them, thinking one day my own child will wear them.

she's only had healthy, normal pregnancies and has no concept of MC, TTC, or the sadness and frustration that comes with it.
I unfollowed everyone on my facebook feed that is preg or has a little one, it took a lot of effort but at least there isn't a new sonogram every day to cry about. 
now, 5 weeks after my MC (we were gone for a month visiting family for the holidays) she wants to hang out. how do i tell her that i can't see her because I can't SEE her. Like the sight of a belly or bump is going to literally shake me to my core.
I feel so horrible and selfish and just stupid and pathetic and immature but it really hurts. this MC has made me feel defective and less of a woman and to have to be confronted with it I just can't do.
She's an outspoken person so i know this will start a thing, and maybe she's right - that I have to get past it (she hasn't said this but i imagine that would be her response).
too boot i still have double digit HCG numbers and am nowhere close to my period returning or being able to just TTC so this limbo is not helping. 

And also i don't want to be weird and not ASK her about HER pregnancy or new house or other kid. 3 Years ago I was happily planning her shower, newly in love with my now DH, and 100% sure that one day i would be a mom myself.

Really accepting this baby is gone. But as soon as we start making plans for that month, I totally lost it. I guess I just need to tell someone, and I feel like you all might understand. It&#39;s just....harder than I thought coming up on the edd. Thanks for hearing me out.</p>

I'm 33, DH is 35. I stopped the pill in December of 2013 so I think this is cycle 13 or 14? I had two miscarriages in the past year, both at pretty much exactly 7 weeks. First was a missed miscarriage in May and was really traumatic, and the second happened more naturally around Thanksgiving just after the first ultrasound. 

So it seems *getting* pregnant isn't my problem, just staying pregnant. Had a good talk with my doctor, both DH just went in to do blood-work and tests, no results yet. Doctor said she's gonna put me on progesterone and baby aspirin as soon as I get pregnant again. Turns out my mom was on progesterone for the entire duration of both her pregnancies, so it might be a genetic thing.

So here we are, trying again. Last time it took 3-4 months for each and I just started my first cycle again I'm on CD 12. This sucks, and I hate that we have to go through it again, but here we are.

Friday night, DH and I saw our close couple friends for the first time since the MC.

I wanted to solicit your advice.  I lost my pregnancy at the heartbeat appointment (blighted ovum), but it took 16 months of infertility for us just to get pregnant at all.  So not only was the loss hard, but it was compounded by all the months of infertility hell and now the upcoming who-knows-how-long it'll take us to get pregnant again.

That said, I would like to get a tattoo of a rose (June's birth month - my due date was June 12th) to honor the loss of that child and the loss of all the hope that came with it.  My thought is to do it in the middle of my right side, maybe a little set back to avoid any future stomach stretching.  That also allows me to add to it as necessary and work my way down onto my hip, etc, in case there are future losses or future actual children.  And since this is a very personal thing for me, it's placed in a spot where people won't constantly ask about it.

So on to the advice... I happened to find a perfect tattoo artist who does great things with florals, and while I was bawling and a bit drunk on new years eve, I decided to submit a request via her website.  Well, she got back to me and said she was so sorry for my loss and understood the pain personally.  So not only is she awesome at florals, but she knows the pain of miscarriage!  Here's the thing though - originally I figured I would wait to get this tattoo until I got pregnant again and had a baby because I didn't want to deal with stretch marks.  But then in my crying fit on NYE, I realized it could be months, years, etc to get pregnant again!  Why am I waiting!  And hell, if I get a few stretch marks where the tattoo is, who cares!  It's only for me anyway!

Anyway, I wanted to get your thoughts on it.  Am I crazy to go ahead and do it now, specifically in the location where I plan to get it?  Right side abdomen, above my hip, below my ribcage, kind of in that soft area in between.  And set back enough that it's not encroaching on my stomach area.

Thanks for your advice!

The first time, I was excited about trying, excited during my TWW, slightly disappointed when I got BFNs but hopeful it would happen. When I did get pregnant, I was SO excited for the future, and spent so much time daydreaming about what my pregnancy and having a baby would be like. 

Now I just feel exhausted with TTC. It's not exciting at all, and sometimes I wonder if I'd even be happy if I got a BFP. I don't feel excited about being pregnant again - I feel scared and overwhelmed thinking that I'd have to go through 9 months before I actually have a baby. It just seems like there are so many hurdles to getting there and I don't know how I'll deal with them. I'm not naive anymore - I knew before that baby loss happened but I never thought it could happen to me. Now I know that when I get pregnant, I could miscarry, have a stillbirth, or the baby could have a birth defect again (oh god, that would kill me). Statistics showing that I'm more likely to have a healthy baby don't mean shit to me - once you're in the 2% of people who have a baby with a serious birth defect, the 98% doesn't matter anymore.
