One question that seems to come up a lot is how long bleeding and spotting should last after a loss. I'd like to make this post a resource in the Wiki, so if you could answer the following questions that would be great.

**1. What type of loss did you have (i.e. miscarriage, ectopic, stillbirth, etc.) and how far along were you?**

**2. Did you have a D&C/surgery/etc. or lose the pregnancy naturally?**

**3. How long did you have period-like bleeding after your loss?**

**5. Did you need any additional followup for the bleeding/spotting (i.e. a D&C to remove retained tissue)? If applicable - did your doctor consider your level of bleeding to be ""normal""?**

I don't like to be a me-me-me person but I have a lot to get off my chest. I'm kcnc from North Carolina. Last week at this time we went for our first ultrasound to see the heartbeat. The sac just appeared empty, but the doctor was not at all concerned but had us come back this week. The day after my appointment though I found out my hcg levels were high (37,000) so I had a feeling something wasn't right. I was dreading today! She did the transvaginal ultrasound with the screen turned away from me. My husband could see though and when I saw that he wasn't smiling with relief I just looked at the ceiling. Then the doctor turned the screen back to me and showed me that the 24 mm sac was now not only empty, but there was fluid building up around it and the inside was starting to come apart. She held my hand and very gently told me this was enough to diagnose a failed pregnancy. Even though I was somewhat expecting this, I could not stop the tears! I made some very strange noises trying not to sob loudly. She did make me look her straight in the eye to make sure I understood there was nothing I did to make this happen and it in no way determines the outcome of any future pregnancies. I'm happy I have such a good doctor. She gave me my options to miscarry, and I decided on the D&C only if I could have one last ultrasound just to remove any smallest shred of doubt. She said absolutely and that most women request this. I report to the hospital Saturday morning at 6am.

So then I just took off of work for the day and came home. I've spent my day loudly crying, napping, and emotionally eating. I called my parents too. I had told my mom a few days ago that I was pregnant but that she shouldn't get excited. My dad didn't know anything at all and it was very hard to tell him. But they suffered two miscarriages between my brother and I, so were able to offer the support of having been in my shoes.

I am struggling with so many emotions. Some moments I'm angry. Some moments I'm devastated. Some moments I rationalize with myself. For instance when we got our BFP, I listened to Dixie Chicks ""So Hard"" on repeat and counted my blessings that I did not have trouble conceiving. It was almost as if I thought if I was aware and respectful to how difficult this process can be that I would somehow escape nature's short straw!

The moments that give me the most disappointment is thinking back to how excited my husband and I were. We were so pumped to be parents. There was one Sunday a few weeks ago where we were just out running errands and could not stop laughing and flirting with each other. We were just so so happy! I know we will try again but I feel robbed of that excitement since I'm sure next go-round we'll be so so cautious about getting our hopes up.

But the /r/ttcafterloss chatroom and the comments on my /r/BabyBumps text post have helped me so much today! I hate so much that any of you have had to go through this but today that feeling of not being alone is invaluable. Thank you all! 

PS- I'll just leave with this quote from Angelina Jolie today addressing her cancer scare. I thought it was fitting and maybe will help some of you as well.

After two CPs, I'm ready to do something to try to help. We're eating better (husband has really stepped up to help me with my anorexia that started to creep back after this last loss), exercising (bought a great little exercise bike from Amazon!), and relaxing. 

I've been looking into how I can give our little bean a shot at actually sticking this cycle and am definitely trying out progesterone cream after ovulation, but I've also been reading about the benefits of baby aspirin (just regular aspirin, but usually 81mg instead of 350mg). It looks like it can really help with reoccurring CPs as it thickens the uterus lining. Anyone know anything about this? I was thinking I'd throw it into the pot of things we're trying this cycle and take one per day after ovulation.

I know TFAB and some other subs have wikis but there might be some questions that are more commonly asked after a loss, so maybe a FAQ of their own is a good idea.

What are some questions/answers that you think would be useful in a FAQ for this sub? Should we have general TTC advice (like how to use OPKs, when to test, etc.) or just link to TFAB and only have stuff specific to loss?

Two questions I've thought of:

- When can I try again after a loss?

- Are you more fertile after a loss?

I'm sure you guys can think of more useful questions. Any ideas?

I haven't been saying much in the daily update threads, because this cycle has been absolutely nuts so far and I didn't feel  like taking all the rest of you on the emotional rollercoaster ride I've been on for the last 9 days. 

Last Saturday, my beta draw at the fertility doc came back negative. My period began late the next afternoon, and after speaking with my doctor we decided that upping my dose of letrozole this cycle was an OK idea, so long as I was down with canceling the cycle should I produce more than one egg.  

On Tuesday or last week at my CD3 appointment, it was discovered that my HCG level was a 5.  A 5.  Literally *the* lowest level considered a positive.  This could mean a million things, said the nurse - an ectopic pregnancy, maybe cancer, maybe nothing!  The plan was to draw blood in two days, hold off starting the letrozole, and see.  

Two days later (that's Thursday, for those of you playing along at home) my HCG level is a 6.  We're likely canceling letrozole for this cycle and sending my bloodwork out to an independent lab to see if they agree with the results.  On Friday, Other Lab says my 6 is really still just a 5.  We schedule another blood draw today, and I nearly have a panic attack wondering what the hell is going on.

Doc calls over the weekend and tells me that she suspects I have Phantom HCG.  Long story short, there is *no* pregnancy hormone being produced by my body, but I have developed an antibody that may periodically cause a true false-positive result by reacting with the assay the lab uses to test for HCG.  Look it up.  Apparently women have had hysterectomies because for months their HCG levels made a blip on a blood test and no one knew why, so they assumed that it was cancer or something.  (No joke - also look up gestational trophoblastic disease.  Actually, on second thought, NO DON'T LOOK THAT UP.)  

HCG comes back today at - you guessed it! - a 0 again!  MY UTERUS IS A COMPLETE AND UTTER TROLL AND IS LAUGHING HYSTERICALLY AT MY PAIN.  

In the meantime, I haven't taken a single milligram of medicine yet this cycle, but apparently my estrogen is rising ALL ON ITS OWN WTF.  I might actually ovulate all by myself this cycle.  We're going to monitor and see.  

Anyway, thanks for sticking with this ramble...and think good thoughts over the next week or so.  Come on, ovaries.  Also, fuck you, Phantom HCG.

All the statistics say that less than 5% of women will miscarry twice in a row, ugh. So, what can I ask about tomorrow to have tested? I've lost both right at 5 and a half weeks. I had progesterone and HCG tested at 4 weeks--progesterone was 22 and HCG was 104. HCG was measured again at 4w2d and it was 460, so it doubled fine in the beginning. My thyroid is currently balanced. I take Vitamin D, prenatals, and fish oil. Maybe testing for some type of clotting issue? It's just weird that I lost both at the same time. 

UPDATE: Back from doctor. She has some hope as the bleeding hasn't started, yet, despite everything else lining up with my previous loss (fading tests, loss of symptoms, cramping starting). She ordered another HCG test to compare to last week's. Hopefully I'll find out from the on-call doctor tonight or tomorrow morning. We decided I could keep taking the baby aspirin each morning that I started yesterday out of panic. After the HCG results get back, she'll start ordering more tests. What a roller coaster, I've gone from detaching myself from this pregnancy to now hoping there's a chance.

I had progesterone and HCG tested at 4 weeks--progesterone was 22 and HCG was 104. HCG was measured again at 4w2d and it was 460, so it doubled fine in the beginning. My thyroid is currently balanced. I take Vitamin D, prenatals, and fish oil. Maybe testing for some type of clotting issue? It&#39;s just weird that I lost both at the same time. </p>

<p>UPDATE: Back from doctor. She has some hope as the bleeding hasn&#39;t started, yet, despite everything else lining up with my previous loss (fading tests, loss of symptoms, cramping starting). She ordered another HCG test to compare to last week&#39;s. Hopefully I&#39;ll find out from the on-call doctor tonight or tomorrow morning. We decided I could keep taking the baby aspirin each morning that I started yesterday out of panic. After the HCG results get back, she&#39;ll start ordering more tests.

Ok...It's been a few months after my miscarriage. My doctor's told me I lost it due to stress.(Everyone in my family had a nasty bug including me. I also had an infection and I had three teeth taken out last month. I started a new job in which I was a caregiver(and I put my patients as well as everyone else, ahead of myself). Then there was my father's diagnoses of cancer.) (In fact, when I found out about the ""MC"" I waited five days to tell my mom. And I said that it couldn't get worse. Her exact words were: Yes they could bc dad's results came in and he does in fact have cancer.)

So after consulting with my primary doctor, my ob, and my husband I decided to go back to my job as a stay at home mommy and wife. I left my previous caretaking job totally. So no more stress with that. Since the ""mc""(I'm sorry that's they only way I can say it w/o bawling) I have been really really down. Blaming myself and resenting myself.

I haven't been on here much but figured you all would be the best to ask (I've already msged the doc but since it's Friday night I won't hear back for a while). 

As some of you know, I have been having just the craziest spotting the my doc concluded as ""I don't know why you have it"" but there was no physical reason such as fibroids or polyps. I have a suspicion that my body gears up to ovulate but never does due to lack of progesterone. Now, the doc said that she can do a progesterone treatment for 10 days and see if that will reset everything (great!). So my questions are:
1) Can you possibly ovulate and/or get pregnant upon starting this before the cycle ends?
2) If by some magical amazing way I have conceived (only 2""dpo"") or would that interfere with implantation?
3) Is this just progesterone or something else?

I currently work at an HR department for a hospital. My position is full time. I'm a Generalist and work the front desk. Things I like about my job is that I enjoy dealing with people (most of the time Anyway), I like my coworkers, couldn't ask for better people. What bothers me about my work is how far from my home it is. It's 23 miles away and it makes the commute tiring. I also would like a more flex schedule.

I currently work at an HR department for a hospital. My position is full time. I&#39;m a Generalist and work the front desk.

What bothers me about my work is how far from my home it is. It&#39;s 23 miles away and it makes the commute tiring. I also would like a more flex schedule.

So I started charting last September. I had a CP in December and decided I would cut back on the TTC madness. I stopped checking my cervix and squishing around CM. That next cycle, I charted only to confirm ovulation, then stopped. The past two cycles, I haven't charted at all and it's been kind of nice because I haven't had to worry about anything. 

However, I had a CP this last cycle and now worry that I should start charting again. I am determined NOT to use any HPTs before my period shows up and know that I would feel relieved to see the temp drop right before period shows up (or maybe it would stay high!). I kind of drove myself to insanity and just want to get a second opinion on what to do. We're also not planning on going to the doctor until mid-May because we'll be relocating and I'd have to find a new doc anyway.

I found Dr demir on Google after big fed up with my treatment the last two times. He has had ladies as late as 20 weeks fly to him for his procedure so I trust him

It gets better. There is hope. 
If you are around az and need this procedure I really recommend my Dr and if you aren't try the abby looper message board to find a doctor.

Good luck everyone and sticky baby dust to all.

52,2048,confidence,<praw.reddit.Reddit object at 0x7f12a630cd90>,,ttcafterloss,"Hi all. I don't think I ever posted an official intro before so decided I would do so this time. I apologize in advance for the wall of text, it's a been a long journey for us so far.

We stopped BC in July planning to officially start trying around September and lucky us, actually conceived that very first cycle in September without even ""trying"" much! We were excited, but almost felt like it was too easy. Well after very minimal symptoms my 7wk scan showed only development at 5w+4. We thought it ok, I'd had long cycles since coming off BC and didn't track anything but CM so could easily be off with the dates. However, 2 weeks later the scan (what should've been 9wk) showed exactly the same, still 5w+4. The diagnosis was MMC. I was given blood tests and called back in for a final confirmation scan and all signs pointed still to MMC. At that point it had already been 4 weeks since the baby stopped growing and my doctor didn't feel comfortable waiting longer to miscarry naturally, so we went ahead with the D&C just before thanksgiving. We actually didn't tell anyone because we didn't want to worry family and they didn't know we were actively TTC. 

Another longish cycle after D&C and we were ready to try again in February. I actually had a short cycle (for me, about 26 days because I ovulated at a normal time finally) so was pretty pumped that my body finally seemed to be regulating after stopping BC and all the other junk it had been through! At 8DPO I got a shockingly dark BFP a and was a little confused but hey, a BFP! Just a few days later, at what I thought was about 3w+4, I had an episode of pretty bad nausea which had me excited thinking things were going well; I'd had no nausea with the first. We had a nice, relaxing trip planned for spring break last week and I was able to put everything aside and not worry about the pregnancy. However, on the last day of the trip I started having some intense abdominal pain associated with a bowel movement. Since we were traveling I couldn't go right away so the pain got pretty intense but subsided after I was able to go. It did seem to be lingering a bit longer on the left though. I knew I'd ovulated on the left (I get mittleschmerz) so was a little concerned then but chalked it up to eating bad food, traveling, and waking up early for the flight. I kept having the feeling of being a bit ""full"" in my abdomen but pain was minimal only seemed a little exaggerated on the left. I rested Sunday when we got back, still felt a little meh but seemed totally in the norm for pregnancy. Google scared myself though and decided if I still felt weird the next day I'd call my doc and ask questions. Well Monday, back at work, I made it a couple hours but started to feel another intense wave of morning sickness. After throwing up twice and spending an hour laying in the back seat of my car with a trash can I drug out of my classroom, I decided I was in no condition to teach (lol) and called in a sub for the second half of the day so I could go see my doctor. Thinking I pribbably had a bad ovarian cyst, those run in my family, they booked me an early US right away. The look on my doctors face when she found the pregnancy, with a heartbeat (which never happened last time) but outside of the uterus was probably the most devastating part. She's very supportive and wants good things for her patients just as much as we do. She even took my hand in her office and, knowing we were both strong in the same religion, prayed with me right then and there. I suppose the bright side is I'm ovulating fine, my hormones are fine, and my husbands sperm are fine. I also seem to have a pretty accurate idea of what's going on in my body and that ""full"" feeling was blood pooling in my abdomen. The bad news is my body seems to like being in the unlikely statistic and I'm now down one Fallopian tube. We obviously won't be trying for another few cycles but I just needed to share my story with someone. As soon as my body is ready we'll be back at it. I'm not quitting until all of my reproductive organs are gone! But for now trying to recover from a laparoscopy and get this awful gas stuck in my ribcage out of my body.

I have my CD3 appointment scheduled for tomorrow, but when I talked to the nurse's desk today they said that my doctor's plan was tentatively to keep me on the same dose of Femara that I was on this past month (2.5 mg).  

This dose is half the dose that I took in May, which is when I became pregnant with Ethan.  It's also the dose that produced only so-so follicles midway through this cycle, which resulted in just one 18-19mm follicle that ovulated before I could trigger.  These are very similar to the results I got on no medication back in January, and 20mm is usually the minimum my doctor likes to see; 24mm is ideal on this medication.  Given that I only got my IUI in after getting a positive OPK on my own at home (the monitoring appointment I had set up would have wound up being post-ovulation), that I know it happened a day too late, and the the egg was iffy at best...I feel like this was a relative failure of a cycle and that it would be a given that we'd up the dose this coming month to what had worked before.  

My doctor said she's open to upping the dose, but is concerned about multiple follicles.  The nurse made it clear that if I produce more than one follicle that they will cancel my cycle and, I assume, also tell me to not try getting pregnant on my own.  With my bum cervix they do NOT want me pregnant with multiples, which I agree with. 

Weirdly, my doctor also seems to think that this cycle isn't the more-or-less failure I thought it was, since we performed an IUI and my follicle was in the ""mature range,""  I feel like I know my body, though, and pregnancy was not gonna happen.  Circumstances were not anything even close to like what wound up being successful last year. 

So the question is...what do I ask for next month?  Do I up the dosage back to 5 mg BECAUSE THAT'S WHAT WORKED and I only produced one follicle on it back in May?  Overall, the chances of having twins are less than 1% on Femara anyway... so while my doctor is concerned, and having to cancel a cycle would be devastating, I feel like the chances of this happening are really small.  On the other hand, maybe it's worthwhile to listen to the doc's recommendation and play it cautiously for one more month.  There's also the question going back down to a lower dose is a possibility if a higher dose this month doesn't work.  

I just feel more secure upping the dose...but I don't want to set myself up for an even bigger disappointment later this month if I respond too well to the meds.  I can't figure out what the right course of action is, since I'm surprised my doctor and I didn't think alike this month. 

Maybe I'm also mainly frustrated because I should have a fucking baby in my arms and instead I wore the wrong absorbency tampon to school and wound up having a leak in the morning.  Gross.  Luckily I think I caught it before anything got onto my pants...which were black today anyway... ugh.

You guys were so helpful last night with helping me figure out what to do. I jumped back and forth today between going to the ER and not going and gave my body one last chance to prove itself.

I'll go to the doctor tomorrow if I still feel so unstable, but I wanted to update you all and let you know I'm doing fine and I really appreciate you all pouring out your love and helping me. :)

Monday I went to my GP to see about my symptoms, nausea that lasted a week and got progressively worse, lower abdominal pain, sore breasts, generally not feeling well. She decided I should go to A&E in case something was wrong after the D&C. So up to hospital I went. I ended up having to stay in from Monday to Thursday. I had a kidney infection after the MC, which was what was causing my symptoms. Also HGC levels also hadn't gone down all the way to zero, they were at 10 the last time I was tested. I also have an ovarian cyst, 4.8cm. Apparently that coming on around the same time as the kidney infection didn't help things. 

Luckily the antibiotics are working for the infection and I'm feeling a lot better, and am super glad to be home. I have a few side effects from the antibiotics, but overall doing better. Also AF decided to show up at the same time as side effects, which feels lovely.

I went in the ER Sunday night, waited about 6 hours, got blood tests and was diagnosed with the flu. I was tested for staph, where they take a blood sample from each arm. If both are positive it's staph, if one is positive it's most likely contamination. On Tuesday I get a call saying one was positive and one was not, so to come into the ER, don't check in as an ER patient, we'll have you in and out all we need is bloodwork. Not sure why I couldn't go to the lab so I went and ended up waiting about 8 hours in the lobby to get in. Got another call today saying they got the same result and to come back into the ER. I flat out refused, saying no way in hell am I waiting in the ER with the flu again, where I could give it to others and possibly get something else.

If I manage to conceive I'm still at high risk for miscarriage as the placement and size of the fibroids will most likely impact placental development. Big fat sigh. 

The surgery has to be done as close as possible to the last day of bleeding, and the surgeon only does them on Wednesdays, so I'll be waiting till April. After the surgery I'll wait till I get a period, then the doctor will send me for an ultrasound, and if everything is normal, I'll be cleared to try again. So we are looking at May at the earliest. One upside is that she will be using a surgery method that requires only half the dilation of the  traditional surgery method. It will put less stress on my cervix.

The doctor was really nice. She listened to all my concerns and had thoroughly gone through my health records from Toronto. She told me that she definitely would not be using the watchful waiting method of cervical assessment when I do get pregnant. The tear was at the top of my cervix, and she said that even though it healed, scar tissue could contribute to weakness at the top, and once the top starts opening, the cervix is going to open completely. As far as she is concerned my risk of this happening again is too great to wait.  She suggested a TVCIC which is a type of cerclage placed much higher up the cervix, and is done in pregnancy.  She did suggest getting pregnant as soon as we can after the surgery because the fibroids will grow back, and probably as quickly as they are growing now. She also recommended the Mirena IUD for after I give birth to try to keep my uterus relatively clean till we're ready to have another child. (I was thinking 'do this again? Ha!’)

I'm disappointed (currently weeping in a Starbucks while avoiding eye contact with everyone) but trying to tell myself that this is not as bad as it could be.

After the surgery I&#39;ll wait till I get a period, then the doctor will send me for an ultrasound, and if everything is normal, I&#39;ll be cleared to try again. So we are looking at May at the earliest. One upside is that she will be using a surgery method that requires only half the dilation of the  traditional surgery method. It will put less stress on my cervix.</p>

<p>The doctor was really nice. She listened to all my concerns and had thoroughly gone through my health records from Toronto. She told me that she definitely would not be using the watchful waiting method of cervical assessment when I do get pregnant. The tear was at the top of my cervix, and she said that even though it healed, scar tissue could contribute to weakness at the top, and once the top starts opening, the cervix is going to open completely. As far as she is concerned my risk of this happening again is too great to wait.  She suggested a TVCIC which is a type of cerclage placed much higher up the cervix, and is done in pregnancy.  She did suggest getting pregnant as soon as we can after the surgery because the fibroids will grow back, and probably as quickly as they are growing now. She also recommended the Mirena IUD for after I give birth to try to keep my uterus relatively clean till we&#39;re ready to have another child. (I was thinking &#39;do this again? Ha!’)</p>

<p>I&#39;m disappointed (currently weeping in a Starbucks while avoiding eye contact with everyone) but trying to tell myself that this is not as bad as it could be. I&#39;m having some feelings of body anger and frustration with this supposedly easy and natural process (fuck that shit) but I&#39;m trying to focus on step 1 and take it from there. I&#39;ll probably keep hanging around here because you ladies are just the best. Xoxoxo.</p>

I miscarried on Feb 19 and had a D&C done. I only had slight spotting afterwards and very little cramping. 

Since Sunday March 1 I've been nauseated and my breasts are really sore. The nausea just seems to be getting worse. I could hardly sleep last night because I just felt so sick. Nothing seems to help calm it. It's actually worse than when I was pregnant, at least then if fluctuated throughout the day and would calm down after eating. My boobs have been feeling worse as well, it feels a bit like someone is stabbing them.

I'm actually pretty paranoid that something was missed during the D&C. I POAS a few days ago to make sure it was negative, which it was. Though I know that doesn't mean that I'm in the clear.

Friday Feb 27 was the first time after the MC that SO and I were intimate. It was sort of accidental. I got really drunk because I was just not in the best of moods and one thing led to another. And because we were drunk protection didn't really come into play. Obviously even if everything was back in working order by that point it would be way to early for it to be causing my symptoms.

If my nausea continues (which seems likely at this point) should I go into my GP Monday for blood tests? Or do I just try and ride it out until some sort of bleeding shows up? 

Thanks for any advice. I'm just really tired of feeling sick. I can barely manage taking care of myself. Doing dishes and making food, plus trying to keep food down, was pretty torturous.

Husband was able to come (thank goodness) because he wanted to see the ultrasound. Some friends of ours told us that we would be able to see an actual baby and he couldn't wait. It almost wasn't meant to be because he took too long to get ready and I almost left without him because I was worried about being late. I am so grateful I didn't do that.   

After a short talk, my doctor had me lie down for an ultrasound, saying the baby was now big enough to see through my belly. She didn't see anything but said it could be because my bladder was empty and not to worry because it would definitely work during my next visit.   

So, I moved so she could use the trans-vaginal u/s. I can't forget just how happy I was when I first saw him. Little arms, little legs, everything. Then, she asked how far along I was. When I told her, she said that he was way too small. She then moved the wand all around trying to find a heartbeat. Nothing. I could tell she was shocked and just kept telling me how sorry she was.   

He had been dead for a week and my body didn't realize. To be honest, I didn't know that could happen. I thought miscarriages always came with blood and cramps. Plus, I still **felt** pregnant. I still had morning sickness (no more killer heartburn, but the 1st trimester was almost over and people kept telling me I would start feeling better soon) and my hormones weren't going crazy (another 'surefire' sign everyone kept telling me).  

I felt betrayed. By my body for keeping the fetus for so long. By 'society' for not talking about miscarriages in a way that actually lets you know the different ways it could happen. By everything, really.   

Had my D&C yesterday. I didn't want to wait for it to happen naturally and my doctor was concerned that it hadn't happened already. While it was technically easy, it was still very hard. In the recovery room I could hear some of the women crying when they woke up from the anesthesia.

As you can see, it's kind of a mixed bag of misfortune. I did have a reoccurrent loss panel (including karotyping) and we also did genetic testing on the product of conception from the last miscarriage. No abnormalities found.
