7,2048,confidence,<praw.reddit.Reddit object at 0x7f12a630cd90>,,ttcafterloss,"Hey guys.  Could use some advice. 

For those who haven't been following my relationship saga, husband and I were trying for a couple of months to conceive (husband reluctantly but agreeable) before MIL came for a visit.  Since then, DH stated that if we continue to try for a child, it will be against his desires, and he will suffer from severe psychological distress if we conceive and have another child.  At the time, I decided we should stop until this is clarified, because it would be better for me to regret not having a child than him to regret *having* a child.

Clearly we are going to go into counseling of some kind.  But my question is this.

Would I be a heartless bitch if I asked him to keep trying for the next month or two because of the timing of what would be a theoretically perfect maternity leave?

I'm 32 (birthday is in April).  It took us 14 months to get pregnant with my first.  (Only once with the second, but that was random methinks.)  A big part of my job is school consultation work.  If I got pregnant this month, assuming the pregnancy went to term, maternity leave would perfectly hit summer vacation.  If I got pregnant the following month, it would hit two months of summer vacation.  If I don't try for at least these two months, I think the regret would be overwhelming.

He has a baseline anxiety disorder, and he is still grieving our losses.  I really understand and appreciate that, and I want to respect it.  And early childhood with our son was really REALLY hard on him, and he is scared of going through that again.  And he needs to process that, and process his fears.  And it would be beneficial for me to process my desire for a larger family and to explore that more thoroughly.  I get that.  

But...that's a long process, and time is against us.  And these two months particularly are the two months I have been foolishly thinking about for over a year.  This was the time I have wanted to try for since before I was even last pregnant.  I'm not sure I can survive the indefinite nature of waiting for something that may never happen, if my husband is not willing to confront his cognitive distortions.  

And it is hard for me to decide what to do because my husband, who I love dearly, has a tendency to flip back and forth between stances.  I can't trust that his position at one moment will be his position in the next moment, though I really do believe he will always be reluctant because he gets overwhelmed by the concept of change and transition, even desired change and transition.  Yet he is truly passionate with a depth of emotion that is truly beautiful, and he is a wonderful and amazing father, even though he thinks it is not his strength.

I'm rambling...guys, any advice or opinions you could provide would be so helpful.  Especially if you also have insight into experience with anxiety.

I found out I was pregnant last month and it was terribly exciting. I went a little nuts with buying things; I got gifts for our parents, a little onesie, a bunch of prenatal workout DVDs. I was a little bummed when my first scan was too small to see anything. And the second... and my doctor really wanted to find it to make sure it wasn't ectopic and when we found out it wasn't we couldn't see a heartbeat. I waited two weeks and went back for a follow up (at almost 9 weeks) and there still wasn't a heartbeat and the little nugget hadn't grown past a measured 5 weeks. I was very sad and was given the option to get a D&C that day, let it pass naturally, or take the pill to help it pass. I opted to have the D&C, I couldn't imagine waiting for it when I had the option of having closure that day. 

I put everything I purchased in a little box today including the one photo of the nugget I had. I hope to pull out that box again soon. 

The D&C was pretty painless (Wednesday) but today I'm experiencing heavy cramping so I'm taking it easy. Thought I'd post here now so when I'm safe to try again I won't feel like I'm barreling into a community.

I found out I was pregnant last month and it was terribly exciting. I went a little nuts with buying things; I got gifts for our parents, a little onesie, a bunch of prenatal workout DVDs. I was a little bummed when my first scan was too small to see anything. And the second... and my doctor really wanted to find it to make sure it wasn&#39;t ectopic and when we found out it wasn&#39;t we couldn&#39;t see a heartbeat. I waited two weeks and went back for a follow up (at almost 9 weeks) and there still wasn&#39;t a heartbeat and the little nugget hadn&#39;t grown past a measured 5 weeks. I was very sad and was given the option to get a D&amp;C that day, let it pass naturally, or take the pill to help it pass. I opted to have the D&amp;C, I couldn&#39;t imagine waiting for it when I had the option of having closure that day. </p>

<p>I put everything I purchased in a little box today including the one photo of the nugget I had. I hope to pull out that box again soon. </p>

<p>The D&amp;C was pretty painless (Wednesday) but today I&#39;m experiencing heavy cramping so I&#39;m taking it easy. Thought I&#39;d post here now so when I&#39;m safe to try again I won&#39;t feel like I&#39;m barreling into a community. </p>

<p>so hey, hi. Here&#39;s to it getting better for all of us. </p>

12,2048,confidence,<praw.reddit.Reddit object at 0x7f12a630cd90>,,ttcafterloss,"This week 7 years ago I found out I was pregnant. 

I was using the NuvaRing. I took it out for the one week period allowance, had my period the first day it was out, and had sex the evening my period ended. I then realized my prescription was out of refills so made an appointment with a local ob/gyn. 

I went in about 8 days after I'd had sex and had my exam and he gave me a referral to a dermatologist to have a mole removed from very near my crotch. He also wanted to schedule an ultrasound and tests with me to actually confirm a PCOS diagnosis from 5 years prior where the diagnosing doctor did zero tests.

He left the room to schedule the ultrasound and came back in a few minutes later, gently took the referral he'd given me from my hand, and told me I was pregnant. I didn't believe him. I thought he'd accidentally tested the wrong urine. He told me that he'd verified the positive himself and sent me immediately for a blood test and attempted dating scan.

From there on was kind of a blur. I had at least 3 more ultrasounds over the next few weeks, and 3-4 more blood draws, and two more doctor's visits. I'd told the guy, cried on the phone to my mom and dad, told my roommate and my best friend for moral support, and most of my other friends because secrets were hard to keep. My car broke down on the way back from the next ultrasound appointment and I was luckily able to buy the guy's old car off him right away.

I knew emotionally without even thinking about it that I didn't want to end it, though I've always been pro-choice. I still at least tried to think about it logically but ended up deciding I couldn't possibly go through with it. The guy was super supportive, though we weren't technically dating. We started calling it Cricket, between us. Everyone was supportive, though my mom had a very brief freak out and told me that I couldn't have an elective termination and that she'd raise the baby (2000 miles away from me) if I didn't want it.

Then things started looking bad. My levels were not quite doubling like they should. They were over 2000 and the technician expected to be able to see something on the ultrasound, but all they ever found was the corpus luteum cyst.

My incredibly sensitive and kind young doctor called me in on Wednesday, October 1st, after I'd had three weeks to get used to being pregnant and expecting a child, and told me it was ectopic. He didn't know exactly where it was so he'd have to do a laparotomy to find it. I was scheduled for surgery the next morning.

It was gut wrenching. I actually went back to work and worked the rest of the day just to keep my mind off it. I then went home, took a pregnancy test (that stupidly came up negative, making me cry even more) and cried myself to sleep.

I went in the next day and had the operation. That cyst they kept seeing turned out to be hiding the pregnancy. It had started to rupture my tube and they couldn't save it. I never even had any pain and honestly would have only just started to realize my period might be late.

I hated myself afterwards. I had been pregnant, and *I gave permission* to the doctors to remove that pregnancy. I thought the pain killers they gave me as causing me to have suicidal thoughts but it may have been plain old traumatic depression. It took me a really long time to get back to normal. I ended up moving 1000 miles away a year later just to get away from the memories. It did finally help the guy and I end our incredibly toxic pseudo-relationship and move on to actually being just friends.

It took until about this time last year for me to even consider trying to have a child. I've always been way too terrified of going through that again because I know I won't survive it next time. I still am, but the fear is outweighed by the possibility of it not happening.

I actually talked to the guy last night. We both used to play an online game and we both quit years ago. He apparently picked it back up casually a few weeks ago and I randomly decided last night to start playing. The timing of it is all too jarring. I logged off after talking to him to go have sex with my new, amazing SO in an attempt at a new pregnancy. I don't really know how to deal.

I never post here because I don't really feel like I belong. My first pregnancy was unplanned, and unwanted until it actually happened. I feel like that makes my loss less than those of most of you ladies. But there are times like these when I can't really handle it on my own.

I've been lurking here for the past several days, and am impressed by how supportive this community seems to be. 

My husband and I found out a bit over a week ago that we lost our first pregnancy. A week before that we'd had our first ultrasound, and little blip was measuring behind, but within the margin of error (I wasn't 100% sure of O date). A repeat scan the next week showed no fetal growth and no heartbeat, and we were diagnosed with a missed miscarriage. I scheduled a D&C for a week later, hoping my body would take matters into its own hands first. It did not, other than very slowly decreasing hCG numbers, so I had the D&C on Friday. It went as well as these things go and the physical recovery has not been bad.

Anyway. I don't yet know what our future TTC plans will involve. We will wait at least until I've had a period after the D&C to try again, maybe longer. We were lucky to get pregnant quickly the first time, so hopefully that will happen again once we're ready, though I have some concerns about my body's ability to hold on to a pregnancy after this. My doctor said the location of a fibroid (even though it's small) could have led to this miscarriage, because implantation was so close. They didn't seem concerned about it happening again but it still gives me pause...what's to stop the next pregnancy from implanting in the same place? I'm scared that we'll get pregnant quickly again only to go through another MC.

Sorry for the rambling. Basically just wanted to say hi and that I'm thankful to have found what appears to be a very supportive little corner of the internet.

One question --- I know everyone is different, but for those of you who had a D&C (or MVA), how long did it take for your bleeding to taper off? I had minor spotting for the first two days and thought I was off the hook, then on day 3 had a few hours of intense cramping / passing clots  (there's no such thing as TMI here, right?). Since then it's settled to something along the lines of a light or medium period with very light cramping. Can I expect it to continue tapering back down now, do you think? Is it bad that bleeding didn't start until a couple of days after the procedure? I haven't had any signs of infection or bleeding of the amount they said was dangerous, so I'm assuming this is all within the range of normal...

I appreciate any thoughts you're able to offer.

Since then it&#39;s settled to something along the lines of a light or medium period with very light cramping. Can I expect it to continue tapering back down now, do you think? Is it bad that bleeding didn&#39;t start until a couple of days after the procedure? I haven&#39;t had any signs of infection or bleeding of the amount they said was dangerous, so I&#39;m assuming this is all within the range of normal...</p>

<p>I appreciate any thoughts you&#39;re able to offer. </p>

You don't have to format what you want on the wall a certain way... I know that some people might not have exact dates for their loss, or names, and that's okay. You don't have to include your username, either (just let me know if you want to or not). I was thinking you could include a date (your loss date, or EDD, or something else meaningful to you), name, quote, message to your baby.. whatever you want. Some ideas on how you could format it:

###January

""Babynickname"" - we will miss you 

1st: Babyname (/u/sansascully)

2nd: /u/sansascully

3rd-4th: Babyname

If anyone has any other suggestions or ideas for the wall please let me know.

Neither (allow any flair) - 63%

Discouraged (with note in sidebar) - 29%

Banned - 9%

Since the majority of people didn't want to change anything, I won't be instituting a rule about flair at this time. Like I said in the previous post - I don't want to create too many rules for this sub, because I feel like that can be overwhelming and discouraging for newbies, and I want this sub to be as welcoming to them as possible. I also checked out the user flair page and it seems like the vast majority of ""alumni"" have not mentioned anything about their subsequent pregnancies in their flair. I know that many of us have different words/phrases/etc. that can be triggers.. but since we're all different, it's honestly impossible to make this place 100% free of them. If something comes up in the future that bothers a lot of users, we can definitely do another poll to decide if it should be discouraged or banned.

I'd also like to remind everyone that you can use [Reddit Enhancement Suite](http://redditenhancementsuite.com/) to automatically hide posts with certain keywords (for instance, you could set it to hide the daily ""alumni"" thread by using the keyword ""alumni""). Go to your RES settings console (the little cog by the logout button in the upper-right hand corner of your screen), click ""Filters"", and under ""keywords"" click ""+filter"", add the keyword ""alumni"" and have it apply only on this sub (ttcafterloss). There are also filter options in some phone apps like Baconreader, although in that app specifically I don't think you can set it to a specific sub, so it might block any post that has the word ""alumni"" in it.

Thanks everyone. As always, if you ever have a concern, question, or idea for the sub, please send me a PM!

I have been lurking for about a week and this sub has really helped me get through my day so I thought I'd introduce myself.

I had a missed miscarriage at 16 weeks that was detected at my 20 week scan last week.

A day after my 16 week appointment I woke up with the worst back pain I had in my life. I couldn't breath and had to remove my clothes just to get some relief. This lasted for about 10 minutes and after that I was still feeling very weak. I called the nurse line at my obgyn and they said to go to the emergency room. At the hospital they suspected that I had a pulmonary embolism and did a bunch of tests that all came out negative. They looked at the fetus and saw he was still there but didn't check that he had a heartbeat.

After that day I stopped feeling him kick and my stomach started to shrink (I was able to fit into my regular clothes again) but I still had other pregnancy symptoms.

I had a d&c last Friday and went back to work yesterday but I can't seem to stop thinking about what happened and had a very hard time focusing.

The thing is, I felt a little ambivalent about having a baby because I have a health condition that may prevent me from having kids in the future so my husband and I started ttcing very early into the marriage and I felt guilty about this since he is younger than me and I was concerned that maybe we should enjoy being alone for another year or so.

Now, after I lost my baby, I obviously don't feel this way. I feel very guilty that I felt abmivalent about my poor former stomach dweller. 

My husband and I had almost every test possible. We had genetic testing prior to conceiving for me as well as fertility testing and we had the panorama test for the baby and he had zero abnormalities. The pregnancy was progressing really well until 16 weeks and I was taking medication to reduce the chance of miscarriage (for my thyroid) as well as taking prenatal vitamins. I was walking twice a day and eating healthy and just generally taking care of myself as much as I can.

I'm just at such a loss as to what went wrong since having a miscarriage at such a late stage is so rare with absolutely zero indication of any warning signs. I do have a uterine fibroid but the ultrasound tech has been monitoring it throughout the pregnancy and said it was small enough to not be a problem. Maybe in hindsight she was wrong. I am very afraid of this being the start of a long journey with multiple miscarriages. I don't know if I can handle it.

I asked that the fetus be tested to see if there was something wrong with him. The doctor was supposed to give me an amnio while I was under general anesthesia but since he had been dead for such a long time, there was no fluid left. They were able to take a tissue sample from the fetus and hopefully that will have some live cells in it that they can test.

I was wondering if any of you had any experience with testing after a late miscarriage. My obgyn wants me to just try again and not pursue any testing. She says it may have been a cord accident but I really want some peace of mind so this won't happen again.

Should I insist on a recurring miscarriage blood test? Are you aware of any other tests besides this one?

<p>I have been lurking for about a week and this sub has really helped me get through my day so I thought I&#39;d introduce myself.</p>

<p>I had a missed miscarriage at 16 weeks that was detected at my 20 week scan last week.</p>

<p>A day after my 16 week appointment I woke up with the worst back pain I had in my life. I couldn&#39;t breath and had to remove my clothes just to get some relief. This lasted for about 10 minutes and after that I was still feeling very weak. I called the nurse line at my obgyn and they said to go to the emergency room. At the hospital they suspected that I had a pulmonary embolism and did a bunch of tests that all came out negative. They looked at the fetus and saw he was still there but didn&#39;t check that he had a heartbeat.</p>
