<p>So really I&#39;m asking, and let&#39;s pretend I can just get pregnant whenever I want (ha),  is if there&#39;s an expert here who knows if my uterus and lining can sustain a pregnancy just as well right now or if it&#39;s best to have a reset of at least one cycle to allow things to get a bit more normal. I was technically still in the first trimester so it seems like &#39;go for it whenever&#39; is the newer guidance but since I was so close to the second trimester where they say to wait longer should I??? I don&#39;t want to wait! Oh my god I&#39;m sorry this is such a ramble...</p>

54,2048,confidence,<praw.reddit.Reddit object at 0x7f12a630cd90>,,ttcafterloss,"Hi there

I just wanted to share my story, because I can’t get over it and I’m very heartbroken. 

I’ve had an ectopic pregnancy in the end of March and I’ve lost the baby and my right Fallopian tube on 6th of April. What is funny - I ovulated out of my left ovary, but stupid right tube caught the egg and got all tangled behind my uterus. After the surgery I’ve been told that my other tube looks great and we should have no problem getting pregnant again. However she said “if you are not pregnant in 6 months, let’s check if your tube is blocked”. Ugh also important to mention - while I was going through this, my husband was in a psychiatric hospital as he had a nervous breakdown because of COVID. So I had to go through all this alone.

So come end of August, my period is late and I get a really faint positive line on hpt. We’re so excited, only took us three cycles to get pregnant again. However the line was not progressing as well as I wanted it to and I also I’ve been spotting since the day of my expected period. 

I have called my local clinic and they say “sorry, but nobody is gonna see you until 8 weeks, we’ll schedule an appointment with a midwife”. Well thanks, but I’m spotting now and have a pain on my left side, so I’d prefer to be seen ASAP. But well, thanks to our stupid healthcare system, nobody even sends me to get my hcg levels tested. I had to call the Gynecology department in the hospital the next day since I started bleeding heavily. Finally they agreed to see me and get my blood tested. 

There was nothing in the uterus on the ultrasound, but there was also nothing in my remaining tube (however they talked about seeing some weird spot in my left tube). They said I’m just miscarrying naturally. However my hcg levels keep on rising (they are very low atm 46,1 - 64 - 93) and now they suspect a second ectopic. 

Also there were several doctors who were in the room during ultrasound and one of them told me “Well, in case it’s ectopic, we’ll most likely have to remove your second tube. If it happened once, there’s a good chance it will happen again, so it’s better if we just have it removed. You can always do IVF, you have a pretty good chance as it seems your ovaries are working just fine.” Mind you, my hormone levels are not too high and I was only 5w2d then, why aren’t we even talking about methotrexate? Now I’m just waiting for another blood test and doctor appointment on Monday to see where things are at.

<p>I just wanted to share my story, because I can’t get over it and I’m very heartbroken. </p>

<p>I’ve had an ectopic pregnancy in the end of March and I’ve lost the baby and my right Fallopian tube on 6th of April. What is funny - I ovulated out of my left ovary, but stupid right tube caught the egg and got all tangled behind my uterus. After the surgery I’ve been told that my other tube looks great and we should have no problem getting pregnant again. However she said “if you are not pregnant in 6 months, let’s check if your tube is blocked”. Ugh also important to mention - while I was going through this, my husband was in a psychiatric hospital as he had a nervous breakdown because of COVID. So I had to go through all this alone.</p>

<p>So come end of August, my period is late and I get a really faint positive line on hpt. We’re so excited, only took us three cycles to get pregnant again. However the line was not progressing as well as I wanted it to and I also I’ve been spotting since the day of my expected period. </p>

<p>I have called my local clinic and they say “sorry, but nobody is gonna see you until 8 weeks, we’ll schedule an appointment with a midwife”. Well thanks, but I’m spotting now and have a pain on my left side, so I’d prefer to be seen ASAP. But well, thanks to our stupid healthcare system, nobody even sends me to get my hcg levels tested.

Yesterday the doctor inserted a dilator so I cramped all day. Last night was really, really peaceful. I had an IVF meditation app that I listened to during the two-week after following the transfer, and a special candle that I would light while I was meditating. The app has a special section of meditations for pregnancy loss. I took a long shower, lit the candle, and did one of the meditations. Then I spread out all of his ultrasound photos on the bed and looked through each one and cried for a bit. I made a sad playlist and listened to it and wrote in my journal for a while.

I never wanted to say goodbye to him. I'll never feel ready to completely say goodbye. But I felt at peace, like he was telling me he loved me and it was OK to let him go today.

This morning I held it together in the waiting room, even when my surgery got delayed by two hours because the hospital's COVID lab lost my testing sample. (They did find it, eventually, and I'm negative.) I started to cry once they were prepping me before the OR. The nurses were so kind. One told me she had two miscarriages before her three healthy children, including the last one born when she was 41.

My doctor was incredible. I had a million questions for her at the appointment yesterday and she answered them all. She let me show her the photos from the last ultrasound where he was healthy. She walked me through all my options for both the procedure itself and for what to do with his remains after they're tested. I had ordered a swaddle blanket and hat to wrap him in at the hospital. She said I could bring one or both to the surgery and she would make sure they traveled with him throughout testing and he would be cremated with them. I kept the blanket for myself and sent his little hat with him, with his name written on it, so they'll know who he is.

The procedure went as smoothly as possible, no complications. She said my uterus is in perfect shape and I should have no issues with it in terms of future pregnancies. I had some cramping when I first woke up from the anesthesia but complained loudly until they brought me painkillers. I was able to eat, pee and walk around about an hour after waking up. I haven't bled or cramped much since I got home.

I asked her if he was beautiful. She said he was.

I came home and rested this afternoon. My husband brought me whatever snacks and drinks I wanted. My mom came over and we ordered Thai food and watched a movie. 

When they told me last Thursday morning what happened I didn't know how I'd survive this process, how I could specifically live through them taking him out of me, where he's supposed to be, where he was supposed to spend the next 6 months. But I did. I'm still here.

And you very real strangers made this girl feel a whole lot better today.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->', 'likes': None, 'suggested_sort': 'confidence', 'banned_at_utc': None, 'view_count': None, 'archived': True, 'no_follow': False, 'is_crosspostable': False, 'pinned': False, 'over_18': False, 'all_awardings': [{'giver_coin_reward': None, 'subreddit_id': None, 'is_new': False, 'days_of_drip_extension': 0, 'coin_price': 30, 'id': 'award_a2506925-fc82-4d6c-ae3b-b7217e09d7f0', 'penny_donate': None, 'award_sub_type': 'PREMIUM', 'coin_reward': 0, 'icon_url': 'https://i.redd.it/award_images/t5_22cerq/80j20o397jj41_NarwhalSalute.png', 'days_of_premium': 0, 'tiers_by_required_awardings': None, 'resized_icons': [{'url': 'https://preview.redd.it/award_images/t5_22cerq/80j20o397jj41_NarwhalSalute.png?width=16&height=16&auto=webp&s=4e475e8c3265ec7148d7f4204f07d33949482f21', 'width': 16, 'height': 16}, {'url': 'https://preview.redd.it/award_images/t5_22cerq/80j20o397jj41_NarwhalSalute.png?width=32&height=32&auto=webp&s=42e32a4b9f1e70791716c3be283e89951e212a69', 'width': 32, 'height': 32}, {'url': 'https://preview.redd.it/award_images/t5_22cerq/80j20o397jj41_NarwhalSalute.png?width=48&height=48&auto=webp&s=5adb621fede4e8e66b952a379ad038fcc1b8ad13', 'width': 48, 'height': 48}, {'url': 'https://preview.redd.it/award_images/t5_22cerq/80j20o397jj41_NarwhalSalute.png?width=64&height=64&auto=webp&s=6161edea19569bbee73ef322a2e5470535ec1787', 'width': 64, 'height': 64}, {'url': 'https://preview.redd.it/award_images/t5_22cerq/80j20o397jj41_NarwhalSalute.png?width=128&height=128&auto=webp&s=5d2c75f44f176f430e936204f9a53b8a2957f2fc', 'width': 128, 'height': 128}], 'icon_width': 2048, 'static_icon_width': 2048, 'start_date': None, 'is_enabled': True, 'awardings_required_to_grant_benefits': None, 'description': 'A golden splash of respect', 'end_date': None, 'subreddit_coin_reward': 0, 'count': 2, 'static_icon_height': 2048, 'name': 'Narwhal Salute', 'resized_static_icons': [{'url': 'https://preview.redd.it/award_images/t5_22cerq/80j20o397jj41_NarwhalSalute.png?width=16&height=16&auto=webp&s=4e475e8c3265ec7148d7f4204f07d33949482f21', 'width': 16, 'height': 16}, {'url': 'https://preview.redd.it/award_images/t5_22cerq/80j20o397jj41_NarwhalSalute.png?width=32&height=32&auto=webp&s=42e32a4b9f1e70791716c3be283e89951e212a69', 'width': 32, 'height': 32}, {'url': 'https://preview.redd.it/award_images/t5_22cerq/80j20o397jj41_NarwhalSalute.png?width=48&height=48&auto=webp&s=5adb621fede4e8e66b952a379ad038fcc1b8ad13', 'width': 48, 'height': 48}, {'url': 'https://preview.redd.it/award_images/t5_22cerq/80j20o397jj41_NarwhalSalute.png?width=64&height=64&auto=webp&s=6161edea19569bbee73ef322a2e5470535ec1787', 'width': 64, 'height': 64}, {'url': 'https://preview.redd.it/award_images/t5_22cerq/80j20o397jj41_NarwhalSalute.png?width=128&height=128&auto=webp&s=5d2c75f44f176f430e936204f9a53b8a2957f2fc', 'width': 128, 'height': 128}], 'icon_format': None, 'icon_height': 2048, 'penny_price': None, 'award_type': 'global', 'static_icon_url': 'https://i.redd.it/award_images/t5_22cerq/80j20o397jj41_NarwhalSalute.png'}, {'giver_coin_reward': 0, 'subreddit_id': None, 'is_new': False, 'days_of_drip_extension': 0, 'coin_price': 50000, 'id': 'award_2385c499-a1fb-44ec-b9b7-d260f3dc55de', 'penny_donate': 0, 'award_sub_type': 'GLOBAL', 'coin_reward': 5000, 'icon_url': 'https://www.redditstatic.com/gold/awards/icon/Trinity_512.png', 'days_of_premium': 183, 'tiers_by_required_awardings': None, 'resized_icons': [{'url': 'https://www.redditstatic.com/gold/awards/icon/Trinity_16.png', 'width': 16, 'height': 16}, {'url': 'https://www.redditstatic.com/gold/awards/icon/Trinity_32.png', 'width': 32, 'height': 32}, {'url': 'https://www.redditstatic.com/gold/awards/icon/Trinity_48.png', 'width': 48, 'height': 48}, {'url': 'https://www.redditstatic.com/gold/awards/icon/Trinity_64.png', 'width': 64, 'height': 64}, {'url': 'https://www.redditstatic.com/gold/awards/icon/Trinity_128.png', 'width': 128, 'height': 128}], 'icon_width': 512, 'static_icon_width': 512, 'start_date': None, 'is_enabled': True, 'awardings_required_to_grant_benefits': None, 'description': 'Legendary level, this award is a no holds barred celebration of something that hits you in the heart, mind, and soul.

We take every precaution! I go to work, I'm a massage therapist, so when I'm not massaging people, I'm just hanging out in my room. SO, I isolate myself from other people as much as I can, I screen my clients before they come in, I wear 2 masks, use hand sanitizer and wash my hands and really, I only go to work, come home and then go to the grocery store. I'm SO careful! He doesn't listen and it drives me nuts. What's even worse is trying to explain the ""biological clock"" thing to him. The man thinks a woman is fertile until she's not (hits menopause). I'm just so frustrated that my future plans hinge on what the rest of the world chooses  to do during a pandemic. I know I sound like a spoiled brat crying for candy, but I honestly feel that if we wait much longer, it's just not going to happen at all! Not to mention, I waited 6 years (we got married 7 years ago) just to get him to try, got pregnant, miscarried, and now I'm being told to wait again for an indefinate amount of time! On top of that, I'm having all my friends and relatives warning me about my ""biological clock"" like I'm the one holding up the works!!

Even worse! I talk to my OBGYN to try to get her perspective and she just gives me a non-answer ""we're following the CDC recommendations"" , tells me to do my own research and sends me the CDC website. I feel so frustrated that I'm not getting any help, any compromise, and that I'm the one that has to deal with people talking to me about something that isn't even my decision! PLUS the people that like to remind me that my due date would be next month and how much of a great mother I would be... which is also brutal.

I'm so sad, so angry, so frustrated. I feel so cheated and I feel like it's unfair to just expect me to just deal with it.

With Covid, I had to go alone to my appointment where I saw pictures of babies on the wall, hearing heartbeats in the rooms next to me, and seeing happy pregnant women. It was heart wrenching for me to sit in my room, alone, knowing I was losing my baby and the one thing I want more than anything. The doctor did a vaginal ultrasound and we could see the sac with the baby inside. This made it even harder for me. Why was there something wrong? I could see the little bean. It didn’t seem fair. The doctor said the baby wasn’t growing and was too tiny and my HCG levels were too low. I would lose the baby over the weekend or need a D&C if my body didn’t do it naturally. I walked out of the office in tears.
But, I’ve spoken to a few women who have experienced this and have really helped me so far. And I know there’s so many others who know the feeling and it’s very common. I am not mad at my body. I know my body is sadly and unfortunately recognizing that something wasn’t right and is trying to fix it. I am just so disappointed and sad. I keep thinking: why me? It feels like I waited so long and then this happened. And it really is a selfish question the more I dwell on it. I can’t complain when I have to be strong and realize there’s far worse things. I have to remember how blessed I am in so many other ways. We all do sometimes. I have a 2 year old son, and I won’t give up having another. I’ll save that big brother tshirt I was so excited to see him wear. I’ll try my best to stay positive even if there’s hurdles along the way and it doesn’t go according as planned. It’s not in my power, I can only do what I can. Keep trying to be healthy and keep trying for a baby. I know I’ll get my rainbow baby. I know this sad, horrible phase will end soon. But I’ll carry it with me for a while. And for now, I’m allowed to be sad.

On 8/20 at my follow up my HCG was 34. On 8/28 it was 11 and my doctor said I could stop testing.  

My doctor said we had to wait until after my first period to start trying again.  

Well, my issue is that I never really stopped bleeding from my D&C.  I gradually had less blood and it was reddish brown and then just brownish discharge. 

On 8/30 I started having what felt like menstrual cramps and the blood got more red again and increased a little.  

Each day it feels like it is a tiny bit heavier but I still could probably go thru the whole day without needing to change a light flow pad.  I’m going to the bathroom so often to see what’s going on that most of it is wiped away and doesn’t make it to the pad. 

This is very different from a normal period for me.  Normally my period is 5 or 6 days.  I have cramps maybe half a day before I start and the heaviest flow is on day one with cramps on days 1 and 2.  

Today the blood looks like my typical deep/bright CD1 with a few tiny clots.  Flow is still pretty light.  Does this mean this is CD1 or one of the previous days?

It was just a rubber stamp on what was already shaping up to finally, finally be a perfect pregnancy, after five years of trying, countless rounds of Clomid, two IUIs, three egg retrievals, and two transfers.

Anatomically, he was perfect. His heart rate was 55. Less than half of what it should have been. The doctor told me it looked like fetal demise. So rare at this stage. So rare especially in a PGS-tested embryo. He had me come back this morning to look again - maybe it was a fluke and things would be back to normal, though he candidly said he wasn't optimistic.

His little heart stopped beating. He's gone. I have to schedule a D&C. The doctor who did the NT scan, my ob/gyn and my RE are all in shock. ""Very unusual."" ""Almost never happens.' ""Just shitty luck.""

We had our MC in April, and have been trying since then unsuccessfully.  Negative at 13DPO today even though my temps are still high, so fully expecting period to arrive tomorrow when it's due.  When that happens we will be moving onto the sixth cycle of trying post-MC.

This morning I booked in consultations with two (figured I'd see which we prefer) fertility clinics for the next few weeks'.  After this next cycle, we will have to take a break for two months, so I thought that might be a good time to investigate embryo freezing.  Nothing is obviously firm yet, and we need to have the discussions with the clinics, but I'm trying to take control of this situation a bit more, and 'make use' of the two months that we won't be TTC.

We are both just under our mid-thirties and know that we want more than one child.  With the shitstorm that this has been so far, I don't want to get more months/years down the road, have nothing to show for it, and have no way to capitalise on my fertility now.  If we do decide to go ahead with retrieval/freezing, I know it will be a pain, but hopeful a temporary discomfort is worth a long-term investment for the future.  My dream would be that we never need to use them and we can conceive all the children we want naturally, but I can't go back and get them if it doesn't work out IYSWIM.

I also know and appreciate that trying for the amount of time we have been since the MC is totally normal to not have success, but I'm very sensitive about my age and the amount of children we ideally want.  Everyone's situations and desires are different.

208,2048,confidence,<praw.reddit.Reddit object at 0x7f12a630cd90>,,ttcafterloss,"Just need to vent today. 

I am in my last year of medical residency in a pediatric subspecialty. My husband and I finally started TTC in March after finding out we would be moving for my 1 year fellowship starting July 2021. We currently live in a very expensive city for residency (not exactly what we had planned) and have been putting off TTC until we found out we would be going somewhere more affordable. 

Finally got BFP in June then had MMC at a little over 8 weeks, had D&C August 19th. 

While obviously a miscarriage is never good, the timing of this really sucks. I basically have 1 more week to get pregnant in our window of opportunity then we will have to put TTC on pause for the next 6-7 months or more. 

This is to avoid being due in the middle of a cross country move, the first weeks of my new fellowship (when new insurance and salary have not kicked in yet), my board exams in September, and prime ""big girl job"" hunting time in Oct/Nov 2021.

<p>While obviously a miscarriage is never good, the timing of this really sucks. I basically have 1 more week to get pregnant in our window of opportunity then we will have to put TTC on pause for the next 6-7 months or more. </p>

Granted, I'd NEVER wish this experience on anyone EVER. But it's an experience no one close to me relates to. No female relative or friend ever even had a definitive MC and conceived within three months of trying. It's hard, feeling like an outlier.

I posted here last week and received a lot of help and insight from you ladies so I figured I'd reach out again with another, slightly in depth, question. As a reminder, I am currently experiencing my third early loss (at 5 weeks).  My OB has referred me to see a fertility specialist, which I am scheduled for on 9/14. Of course, in the meantime I am researching all possible reasons for my recurrent miscarriages and for some reason I feel like it has to do with something causing abnormal cycles. My cycles themselves are pretty regular (around 32-33 days), however my periods are very heavy and can sometimes last up to 12 days. The length of my periods make me wonder if this could be the cause of my losses, because I pretty much go right from my period immediately into ovulation, and I feel like this doesn't leave as much time as normal for my uterus to prepare for implantation. I'm not sure if that is even a possibility, but it makes sense in my head. lol Now my question to you guys is this- we were planning on taking this month off from trying until I talk to the fertility specialist. However, I started bleeding from my most recent loss last Wednesday (9/26), and as of this morning (9/31), it is essentially non-existent. Assuming it does not start up again, this will be the shortest and most normal ""period"" I have had in years. I'm sure I'm thinking too far into this, but this really makes me want to try again this cycle to see if my long/irregular periods could be the cause for my issues- maybe I'll happen to luck out if that really is the problem. I conceived my second pregnancy the cycle immediately after my first loss, so its really tempting to just keep trying this time, especially since everything seems so ""normal"" this cycle. My dilemma is that my appointment with the fertility specialist falls on the day immediately following my predicted ovulation and I don't know if we should just take this month off from trying until I talk to him. I'm so torn because if this could be a good opportunity for us, I would hate to waste it by waiting, but I also don't want to be irresponsible and risk having a 4th miscarriage if my body is not able to sustain a pregnancy.

<p>Amazingly I got another positive test yesterday,  straight after my last miscarrage. This morning I woke up bleeding so I guess I can call this one a chemical. </p>

<p>Life feels very unfair right now! 3 pregnancy losses in 9 months, along with the rest of 2020 and my mental health is suffering. I need something good to happen so badly.</p>

<p>Thanks for reading my rant.</p>

<p>Went back 2 weeks later for a pelvic ultrasound; they found a very large clot still intact. Same dr prescribed me another round of 4 misoprostol. </p>

<p>I’m now 3 weeks out from when I took my second round &amp; 6 weeks out from my first round but after bleeding stopping for ~5 days I’m now having what seems to be my regular period. Is that even possible? Has anyone else has an experience like this? </p>

I had a miscarriage at 6 weeks on 8/18. The next day I had an ultrasound that confirmed my uterus looked empty and they had me come in that Friday (8/21) for blood work. My hCG levels on Friday were 1,700. I went back on the following Tuesday (8/25) were 1,570.

We're in the middle of my FW, so we were supposed to have sex tonight. I wasn't really in the mood, but we haven't done it at all during this cycle yet and we really needed to get on it so we don't miss the timing... especially because I just had an HSG this week and my doc said many women see an increased chance of pregnancy for the first couple months after that procedure. 

It started silly, as it often does with us, and I was laughing. I couldn't stop laughing. I started laughing so hard that I was crying. Then I realized I wasn't laughing anymore and I was just crying. And I couldn't stop crying. My poor husband.

Literally every emotion I've been feeling recently exploded out of me. 

Aching for the pregnancy that ended a full year ago now. 

Sadness at my last living grandparent going on hospice today halfway across the country; knowing I won't get to see him again and any of my even potential future children will not have any great grandparents in their lives like my nieces and nephew were so lucky to have.

Stress about what the next steps will look like and how much it's likely going to cost after an initial phone call with an RE today. 

Anger at myself for not taking better care of my body and eating like crap and being overweight.

Frustration that I was ruining an important opportunity for sex during my FW (and that I wasted expensive Preseed).

Anxiety over being in the middle of a fucking pandemic... and so many other things. 

It's just all too much. And I don't really know how to fully process all of it.

Through a family friend, we managed to have a telephone call with a retired fertility doctor and that did reassure us that things are just taking longer than we expected, but we keep coming back to the fact that we got pregnant maybe the second time we tried, and since we had the miscarriage... nothing.

Maybe 3 or 4 cycles in I started getting vibes that maybe something was quite right, and so I spoke to my GP and she was really good and did some tests that highlighted that I had a high prolactin level. Long story short, I've been chasing my doctors for months over what is probably going to end up being a red herring- even had an MRI almost 4 weeks ago that I've had to chase up so many times. Finally heard the results are in, but haven't heard what they are yet.

I know that it's probably not related as I'm not really having any symptoms related to high prolactin and my periods are as regular as ever, but everything has become such a battle to get anything done that I'm just feeling a bit lost as to what we can actually do to start fertility investigations - add to this that darling husband is having just as much trouble even getting a simple sperm count that I get so frustrated with the healthcare system.

Is there anyone based in the UK that has experience of what comes next? A few weeks ago a doctor mentioned that I might be able to be referred to an infertility clinic (really wasn't that keen on the name!), but I just don't really know what I should be pushing for... it's been about 3-4 months trying to get through the prolactin investigations, and I think the only benefit I really had was that I knew what I needed to get done.

I just experienced my second miscarriage in 10 months, both considered chemical pregnancies. The first miscarriage I ovulated CD11 which is normal as my usual range is CD9-11.

This cycle I’m on CD6 and have already had a huge temp spike.  I know it’s only one temp but the elements last night should have created a cooler BBT.  Last night was much cooler outside than previous days, I slept alone and I had a second fan on.

Just for a little background, two cycles in a row I did ovulate CD6 then CD5.  These were the two cycles following a failed medicated IUI in February.  The medications were Gonal F 150/day for 5 days, Letrozole 25mg CD4 and trigger.  First m/c I wasn’t on any medication and this    m/c I had taken Letrozole 25mg CD3 and triggered.  Both cycles I ovulated CD10 which I’ve been reassured by a few different RE’s those ovulation days are okay.

We lost our baby girl in June at 20+3 due to a placental abruption. It was completely unexpected and very traumatic. My husband and I suffer from unexplained infertility and it took us 5 years to become pregnant with her. Losing her has been devastating, to say the least but we are coping the best we can.  We have also started trying again as we’re both in our late 30s and we feel ready to try again. 

I’m finding it really hard to be around friends who are pregnant. One of my best friends is due two weeks later than what should have been my due date. I have another friend who just announced she is pregnant. Both got pregnant quickly without any troubles. 

I’m struggling so hard with this. They are my friends and I love them. I don’t want them to go through what I went trough but I’m also bitter because they’ve had it so easy.  I’m finding it so hard to ‘fake’ happiness around them. I don’t want to be a bitter, jealous, and angry friend but that’s how I feel. 

I’ve already deleted social media (except Reddit) to avoid seeing posts and pictures from pregnant friends. With Covid, people are socializing less which makes less pressure to hang out. That’s been a good thing, I guess.
