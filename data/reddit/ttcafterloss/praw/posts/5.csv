EDIT: My husband just gave me the shot and we did the deed. So I'm just over here flipping out about if we did it right and all that. Didn't even feel it go in. Was kinda close to bellybutton and kinda high so I'm worried. Guess we'll see, right? I want to keep updating and stuff so I don't feel like it's just my husband and I alone and he doesn't see how batshit insane I am lol. He's not optimistic right now. We're just so used to negatives and to a positive not even meaning baby. He told me until the dr. says we're past the risk he won't believe it is real and is trying not to get his hopes up. Last time he was a wreck at work. He doesn't like people to see him upset or cry but it hit him very hard. This time he's trying to turn off emotions. Sadly, that also means excitement. ): I'm still really nervous. Just keep thinking we messed up. Worried about timing. His numbers were good (130 million with 69% mobility) and we've been doing it every day just in case. Going to do it tomorrow and Friday after taking OPKs. (which may be wrong due to shot?) I hope we catch it! 


Last time I posted here I talked about how I was doing femara 5 mg and how on CD 12 my ultrasound showed a lot of little follicles and not much progress. They stairstepped my femara and had me taking 7.5 mg another 5 days with metformin. Today was my CD 20 ultrasound. 

I was really really nervous, but my doctor was super happy and told me we found the perfect dose that works with my body. I have an 8.8 mm thick lining which she said is perfect for pregnancy, but what she was even happier about was that I have a triple layer lining. She said that was perfect for implantation! Next she took a look at the ovaries. On my right side I had two follicles. A 13 mm and a 15 mm. She said anything over 17 is considered mature but they wanted me to have 20. I was getting a little discouraged because they were at 11/12 mm on CD 12.  So she went over to the left side and found this huge follicle and said ""There we go! We found your dominant one!"" It was 21 mm! She was really really pleased with these results and told me the femara was a success so far! That means even if I don't get a BFP this cycle we know what dose will get me results! I actually feel not broken for once. 

I got my overpriced ovulation medicine today. My husband is going to shoot me up tonight after we work out and then we're going to roll around. We're going to try to actually not stress and have fun with it. Dr. said to have sex tomorrow and friday and then every other day for a week. I have to give myself the second HCG shot on the 4th (Dr is not fucking around this cycle which makes me really glad) to keep my hormones going strong. I then get to test on the 16th. It's not the mother's day test I was originally promised, but I'll take it! So excited, had to share with someone. But also very scared/nervous. I know if it doesn't work I'm going to be absolutely crushed. We're trying to move and just bought a new car so husband said if it doesn't work this cycle we're sticking with the femara but will have to go without the follicle ultrasounds and ovidrel (I spent 500 bucks on all that today while femara only costs me 4 bucks. Stupid insurance) and keep trying the old fashioned way.Then if I do get a BFP I'm going to constantly flip out about my miscarriage risk which is high due to my PCOS. My fingers, toes, and eyes are crossed right now and I am super super antsy for the 16th to come.

When TTC the first time round, I came off of my SSRI after finding out that it can cause a lack of ewcm. I also figured that it would be safer for all those developing systems in my little fetus. Prior to that, I'd been on an SSRI since 2009, with great success. Coming off of the SSRI wasn't difficult, my ewcm reappeared and I conceived. However, my mood during pregnancy ranged from not particularly good, to very bad.
  
After the end of my pregnancy in Nov 2014, the antenatal psychiatry program at my hospital decided that it would be safer for me to be back on an SSRI due to my psychiatric history, and a family history of PPD. 
  
Now here we are, back in the TTC saddle. I'm still on medication and nearing the 6 month mark where I was told I could start supervised weaning. I started attending a support group run by my psychiatrist and a psychologist. It is for people trying to come off of medication. 
  
The thing is, I don't know if I'm doing the right thing. I feel like the research is all over the place and that popular opinion changes with the wind. 
  
Is anyone else in a similar situation? How do you manage your symptoms without meds? How did you decide to not be on medications at this time? If you are on medications, how did you arrive at that decision? Do you plan on staying on them during pregnancy? What research have you found?

Reddit name: jwad1246
Any meaning behind that?: It's the beginning initial of my name Jenny and part of my maiden name. Honestly when I came up with it to post in these subs I wanted to come up with something no one else would recognize me with, but now I don't care. More and more people know I'm trying. 

Age and spouse's age: I'm almost 32, he's almost 34. We're both Mother's and Father's Day babies.

Where do you live: Beautiful Orange County, CA. 

How long trying: About 9-10 months. Off BCP 3 years. 

Describe your positives and the results: Got our first BFP last cycle and it resulted in a CP. 

Any changes from the last positive that you're trying to make: Taking a couple months off to lose some weight, getting some blood tests done and maybe an HSG. Started baby aspirin and this time I have so much less spotting midcycle, and I don't know if that's helping it or what. 

Where are you in your cycle today: 11DPO, slight spotting, AF due in about 4-5 days. 

Any diagnoses?: Not that I know of yet, but I suspect low progesterone because of the spotting. I spot usually 5DPO and onto AF. 

Name 5 random favorite things: Patrick Swayze, Shirley Temple, pigs, the Blues Brothers, obsessed with food.

What are you doing this weekend: Husband is at moto camping trip, so I have the weekend to diet hard, hitting up Burke Williams Saturday for a facial and a massage (Ahhh!) and I have the Bruce Jenner interview tivo'd. Pretty much the perfect weekend. :)

It was kind of a long process so we've had a couple of weeks already to grieve and we have decided to start trying again as soon as we can. Several people suggested that I should head on over to this sub. So, hello. 

My doctor told me that I should wait one cycle before trying again and since I have NO idea what to expect from this next cycle that seems pretty reasonable. I've had kind of weird 7-week cycles since going off the pill last summer and I read that it is possible for things to ""reset"" and cycles to become more normal after a miscarriage. I'm really hoping that's the case for me. Right now I'm still waiting for the bleeding to slow down and my HCG to get back to 0. Hopefully that's only going to take a week or two, but who knows?! 

I'm also having trouble staying positive. I'm hoping it's just because my MC was so recent... but I've already started worrying that I'll have another one, I'm googling WAY too much, and I'm just generally being way more negative about the future than I usually am. What do you tell yourself to stay positive??

This doesn't mean I'm not having a tubal pregnancy, but it's certainly one check mark that helps rule it out.  We drew blood again today, even though it's only been 24 hours, because they already had a needle in my arm to check on my liver and kidney function in case we go the methotrexate route.  

2) Since an ectopic pregnancy is still a big question mark, we need to keep watching my bloods over the course of the rest of this week.  If they do start to drop steadily, THAT IS WHAT WE WANT. I'm going to work this week on telling my body that even if it's broken and likes to play tricks on me, I trust it to do the right thing this week and help me say goodbye to this little cluster of cells, wherever it is.  If the numbers have risen again today and/or if they don't start declining steadily by Monday, we''ll probably just do methotrexate then rather than continuing to wait.   We talked a little about side effects (I might have some, I might have none), but ultimately we'll just cross that bridge if/when we come to it in a few days.  

3) This pregnancy is making my doctor rethink her diagnosis of Phantom HCG from last month and is wondering if last month was really another chemical pregnancy that just resolved itself a lot sooner (especially since my levels went down to zero a few days after my third blood draw that cycle).  As a result, we're now going to count me as a patient who's had two losses in as many months and at some point (I'm a little unclear as to when, probably once my cycle starts again?) we're going to run a recurrent miscarriage panel.  

4) To review, the goal here is to just end this pregnancy and restart my cycle again ASAP.  That may take the form of methotrexate, or careful monitoring, and maybe I'll get a period on my own, or maybe I'll need Provera to induce one; all of this will take on average about 30-40 days (but since my levels are so wonky and low my doc thinks it'll be a good bit sooner than that...she's thinking 2 or 3 weeks at the most).  

5) What do the next few months look like once this nightmare is over?  Well, I'm going to have a *repeat HSG* to make sure my tubes are clear (yay?  Oh no, wait, I think I meant [expletive]). Then - and I guess this is the good news - we'll likely finally be back to where we should be, trying with 5 mg of Femara and continuing IUIs.  My doc is feeling really confident that once we do finally get there it *will* happen quickly.  It worked before, and my body is proving that it *can* get pregnant, we just need to give it the right kind of boost.  I was nervous that given how complicated things are getting - and the fact that it's not unlikely that at least one of these two chemical pregnancies is a result of a chromosomal abnormality - that she would recommend IVF with PGS, but while obviously that would be the most effective thing, my history is indicating that it's just not necessary.  

Her conclusion, which she admits is the understatement of the year? ""This is all just bad luck.  Really, really bad, frustrating luck.  Exclamation points after the frustrating.""  

TL;DR No answer if it's ectopic; methotrexate likely in my future anyway; last month probably wasn't Phantom HCG; recurrent miscarriage panel and repeat HSG in my future; back to Femara and IUI who the fuck knows when; thanks for listening ladies, I love you.

69,2048,confidence,<praw.reddit.Reddit object at 0x7f12a630cd90>,,ttcafterloss,"Hello r/ttcafterloss. Sad update today. Started my period 12 days ago and on CD 3-7 began taking my femara 5mg.Was really excited to go for my CD 12 ultrasound today. Temps have been good, symptoms have been good, and have been having Egg white CM. So I go in there in high spirits until my doctor tell me that my PCOS is still awful and that my body didn't respond to the femara how he liked. 

My uterus lining was 7 which he said he liked, but I didn't have good follicle size. I have one 10 mm, one 12 mm, and one 11 mm on the right and two 11 mm on the left. Then dozens of small ones from the PCOS. So I have five maturing follicles (which scares me a little. I thought the point of femara was to focus on quality over quantity) but he doesn't count the 10 because anything under 10 is considered not progressing. The only promising ones are still small. He wants them to be 20 mm. I am bummed because I wanted to trigger today. My metformin was bumped up to a higher dose and then he put me on a prenatal and a baby asprin to start today. On top of all that he told me to pretend that I am back at cycle day 3 and bumped up my femara to 7.5 mg. So I am on femara again. Twice in one cycle! 
I cried in the car. I know it's stupid, but I just was hoping so hard that my body would take to the femara because it absolutely does not like clomid and I wanted to be able to O and get the show on the road. We have been having sex like crazy trying to catch an egg this cycle and I'm just so emotionally exhausted. My husband has been kind of getting annoyed with having sex every day because he says it feels like a chore. I've been trying to not make it so, but he says since he's so involved in the tracking of this cycle and knows we have to careful with timing he just feels like the sex is no fun because it's not spontaneous and all that. He wants a baby badly, so he's putting forth his best effort and our sex life is still really good, but he's just expressed a little bit of annoyance because he feels this whole TTC thing really takes the romance/sexiness out of it all. I was hoping we could just be done with this cycle and work towards a BFP so we could go back to it being relaxed. I think TTC makes me a little crazy too. 

Since my fertility dr is so far away I've had to take some time off work so I can make the trips out there. When I told some co-workers who asked why I wouldn't be working as much they looked at me like I was the devil. Some who have kids just laughed and said ""trust me you don't want kids. You're lucky, you shouldn't be chasing after it"" or the typical bullshit of ""Well clearly God doesn't want you to have a baby right now since you keep miscarrying. When it's with the right person and the right time it'll happen so just relax."" Uh no. I don't care what happened to your friend's sister twice removed. Just because they tried a year and magically fell pregnant doesn't mean it will magically happen to me after I've been trying for five years and have infertility. 

I dunno, guys. I just feel like nothing in my life is working right now. Work has been hell. My classes got canceled because they didn't have enough students (which I found out happens a lot to my major at my school) so I went to transfer. I got a letter saying they are withholding my transcript because they charged me for a ton of classes I didn't take and my financial aid won't cover it so I have to pay like 700 bucks out of pocket before I can transfer. On top of fertility costs (especially if I have to go IVF route) this is too much. My car's power steering went out on top of a bunch of other issues, so there's that. My husband and I are really struggling to find a new place but we need to move ASAP and all these leads we find keep falling through. Now this fertility thing on top of three women in my family being pregnant right now (one who laughs because they didn't want any more children and complains about the two she does have and the other one who is too immature to even hold a job (because she quits and finds excuses to not have to work so she can mooch), excepts the grandparents to watch the child 24/7, and the husband (my brother in law sadly) has charges against him for raping a little girl and has sexually abused his little sister on top of he also being unable to hold a job (due to him abusing co-workers and being vulgar and sexually harassing women). He abuses his wife (physically and verbally and cheats on her constantly- terrible at hiding it. He's also asked my husband to cheat with him and then asked if he could sleep with me. My husband kicked him out of our house. He is not allowed near me or I might kill him.) and he also has been kicked out by my father in law many times because he'll spend his whole paycheck on things like 500 dollar headphones and stereo systems for his car (which he installed instead of fixing a leak that could have killed him and his passengers) and won't pay his rent (which is small since they charge him less for his being family). He has wrecked two of his dad's cars. But yes, God WANTS them to have a kid but not me. Right. 

Sorry, this went on a little long and is super angsty. I just felt like I had to get that off my chest because it was stewing the entire ride home. I don't really have anyone who understands my TTC woes who can talk with me. Most people just pat my shoulder and either tell me God will make it happen or I'm too serious about it or they tell me that I'm so stupid for wanting all the responsibility of a kid / too young for a kid (I'm about to be 26 in June).

We won't have any alumni babies on the outside for many many months, but as we have more and more alumni it might be nice to have a sense of where folks are at. The idea of putting EDD in flair came up, but a bunch of us would prefer not to do that, it seems. I know that I like feeling like I can comment in the regular daily thread without feeling like my flair will be triggering. Another user suggested a sidebar link to a list of due dates that correspond to user names.

She miscarried about 8 years ago, it was horrible, and we were patient with her. At strong urging from my brother and her we didn't talk about babies or pregnancy around her for over 5 years. She refused to try again, and would randomly bring this up to me while laced it with stories about when they will have kids.... And I wasn't allowed to have a meaningful conversation with her so I just listened. 

Fast forward to this fall, she has a beautiful two and a half year old girl and has just given birth to a new baby girl, I miscarry about five weeks after the baby is born.

I hadn't gotten far enough along to tell her, I had been feeling sick and horrible and I hadn't been over since the baby was born (but had seen the baby a few times). But I did spend the entire summer with SIL and helped her clear out and redecorate her basement, move two y/o into big girl room (and decorate) and put together a brand new nursery and repainted all the furniture and crib. It's fair to say we were close, and also that (stupid me) I did too much for her. 

When I lost the baby, I needed to wallow. I needed someone who would cry and who got it. I called her. I said, look, I didn't even get far enough to tell you, but now the worst has happened and I am ruined.

And she starts REPEATING ""I am so excited"" over and over. I finally said ""I get what you are saying, you are excited we were trying but that's really not the point"" and the ""I am so EXCITED"" continued. It's not an exaggeration that she said this 15 times.

I ended the call quickly and bawled my eyes out. An hour later I got an email with pictures of her babies that said ""I know this sucks but there is fun ahead in the form of butterfly wings and shitty diapers!!!!""

You can imagine how that made me feel. There was no shitty diapers for me to look forward to. My baby died. I felt my baby leave my body in a series of extremely painful contractions just hours before.

I replied that wasn't appropriate and I have stayed extremely low contact since then, which has been awkward through the holidays and most recently Passover but I tried to stay cordial.

There is a lot more to this and how terrible she has treated me, but this is the main bullet point. I am being demonized by her for not forgiving her and coming around to see her every other day like I used to. I've had it out with her once in a very serious way and asked for more space but it's just not happening.  

She says ""I made a little mistake and you won't let it go, no one is perfect and everyone is entitled to a tiny mistake now and then"" which might be true but it's not even remotely the only insensitive thing she's said, I just normal let it go and say ""oh, that's just my SIL, being her usual self!"" This cut me to my core and completely undercut and ignored my loss... I don't know how to move past it.

She has two beautiful girls who I love dearly and I feel like she has forgotten how hurt she was after her own loss. 

I don't even know if I am looking for advise, I just needed to get that out because I am tired of feeling like I am wrong for being upset with how she has treated me the last six months. It's too much of a burden to carry when I want my energy focused on trying again (4DPO, and waiting!).

Thanks for all your sweet, kind, supportive messages. This morning my husband and I cried a bit together, missed our baby boy, and talked about our hopes for the future. I have found that this horrific experience has just made us so much more openly grateful for each other. We went for a long, long walk. We went to a big bird sanctuary at the salt flats at the edge of the Bay and walked for about six hours, just being together, enjoying both conversation and silence. Now we are at home, exhausted, but feeling really good. 
Thanks again, ladies. You are all SO wonderful.
____________________

 I stayed up till midnight so that I could be awake when this day began. 
  
I can't believe how quickly it came up. I don't feel like I lost James all that long ago. November still feels very close by. 
  
I know that today is technically just a date, but I imagined so much around it. My husband and I used to fantasize about the birth. We weren't going to find out gender before birth. When the baby was born my husband would announce our baby's name, cut the cord and bring him to me. We'd each spend time doing some skin to skin and just hold him and love him and be together, our little family.
  
We used to fantasize about our baby's first day on earth. We used to talk about what we'd do to make it special for him. I wanted to make a video for his future, telling him about what his first day of life was like. It still hurts to think that the little boy that we'd loved so much and planned all this for never had a first day of life as a newborn baby. 
  
I don't even know what I feel right now. I do feel like I have the strength to get past this day. As much as my heart is breaking thinking about the baby that I lost, I have come to terms with James' death, and as terrified as I am about going through this again, I am still so hopeful for the future...

I had an ectopic last summer. On valentine's day this year I found out I was pregnant again. I was so horrified, but they said everything looked good at my 5 week appointment. I just got more and more excited. My SO was so excited he told his whole family. I wanted to shop for onsies and had to keep refraining. At 10 weeks, they said nothing had developed and it appeared to be a blighted ovum. We waited to be sure, and then figured out how to handle it.

I was upset, but,I was calm about it. I had a D&C Thursday last week. I kept myself drugged, and stayed in bed. I watched all of the new Netflix Daredevil series, I regretfully caught up on the last season of Pretty Little Liars. I just.. laid there and thought I worked through my shit. I was in some ways relieved I didn't have to keep worrying if I was gonna do something to break my baby. I was relieved that I didn't have to figure out every aspect of my future in less than 6 months. The only thing I felt I was really upset about was having to tell everyone that after almost 4 months, I was never really pregnant. That felt awful and weird and embarrassing, but I felt fine... until my Regional Manager came into my store and kept excitedly talking about my baby..

And I lost it. I waited until everyone left and I lost it. I cried for 4 hours until I drugged myself so I could sleep. I woke up and I cried more. Now I'm crying at work. I'm hysterical... I'm never hysterical, no matter how hurt or upset I am, I'm calm. But.. I cant stop. And I genuinely don't know what to do, or what's even wrong. 

I feel like I need to quit my job and just.. vegetate until I find.. something? My SO and I keep talking about trying again, but I dont even know if I want kids now. It feels like all I want, and it feels like the last thing I want. 

...but im so lost. I genuinely want to drink a beer and take a nap.

That felt awful and weird and embarrassing, but I felt fine... until my Regional Manager came into my store and kept excitedly talking about my baby..</p>

<p>And I lost it. I waited until everyone left and I lost it. I cried for 4 hours until I drugged myself so I could sleep. I woke up and I cried more. Now I&#39;m crying at work. I&#39;m hysterical... I&#39;m never hysterical, no matter how hurt or upset I am, I&#39;m calm. But.. I cant stop. And I genuinely don&#39;t know what to do, or what&#39;s even wrong. </p>

<p>I feel like I need to quit my job and just.. vegetate until I find.. something? My SO and I keep talking about trying again, but I dont even know if I want kids now. It feels like all I want, and it feels like the last thing I want. </p>

<p>...but im so lost. I genuinely want to drink a beer and take a nap.</p>

<p><em>Edit</em>: I seriously don&#39;t know how to thank you all. I&#39;m seriously such a mess, and I have so few people I&#39;m close to, or feel comfortable asking for help from.. I kept reading people&#39;s posts and wondering how or why they&#39;d want to share some of the things they did, only to find that it&#39;s so helpful to have a place where people get it. I appreciate the support so much, I can&#39;t even explain. Thank you! &lt;3</p>

So I had my lunch date with my female acquaintance. It was going well, out on the deck getting sun, lawn chairs, lemonade, she's chatting about some religious cult thing she is in (something to do with a mystical leader who recorded audio they worship, and souls leveling up, idk I was just nodding and mhm'ing politely). 

So she's giving me all this advice on how what helped her will help my panic disorder, (which she keeps relating to her anxiety disorder, similar but not quite). Herbs and meditation and dream readings.  I think she's trying to be really kind and I'm fine listening to anyone's personal beliefs. I was saying how I am very glad that has helped her, and thank you for caring so much for me. 

But then...suddenly she gets all awkward and says how something helped her with her grief over my son. I raised an eyebrow and tensed (as I've only met this lady once or twice in my life and she doesn't know me or my baby), but breathed through it and reminded myself to accept kindness gracefully.  

Me: ""Mhm...?'

Her: "" Well, and tell me if this is insensitive...""

Me: *oh here we go...*

Her: ""But when grieving for Kieran I thought about how the soul can choose a body to enter, and I thought about how maybe....maybe he entered the body and it wasn't a...*good* situation for that soul, so he chose to leave and move on to a new body.""

Me:........

Her: ""Not that anything is wrong with you or your husband's situation!! Just I think that it wasn't a good situation for his soul in that body, and so he chose to leave.""

Me: *biting my tongue* Chose to leave?

Her: Yeah! Like how I think SIDS babies...I think it's caused by them being in a bad situation so the soul chooses to leave. That's why they haven't found a cause for it. They just decide to go.""

Me:…......Er, I mean, but Kieran didn't die from SIDS.

Her: ""Oh. Well we weren't asking. But that really helped me be happy for Kieran. I feel so much better knowing he is someplace better for him.*Maybe that will help you? Think about it.""

Me (after a very long pause): Did anyone tell you how he died? 

Her: No, but we didn't want to ask. 

Me: Well I'll tell you in a bit. But yeah, if that helps you then I am happy for you.

And so I said nothing and later explained how he died and everything. She said that since his body was so sick that he must have chosen to go to a healthy one. I tried to look at it as if from her perspective (kind of difficult as I don't know dumb), and so was just polite and smiled and changed the subject after saying thank you for sharing that with me. 

W.T.F. 

This is why I don't go out anymore. All of the world is insane and idiotic. It feels like everyone is. 

And it was a very obvious dig at my husband and I. She's a prude and I became pregnant before married, plus my husband and I have an age gap that is noticeable.

I hate that I am not really that mad at her, because she is just dumb and can't help it and think she is helping. I am angry that any angry response of mine would have hurt her deeply and not solved anything. 

I am just fed up. I let it go though and am okay.

Thanks for letting me vent.

I have an FSH of 8 which is great, i let myself get relieved and then the AMH number came out - it's .47
