Yesterday I found out there was a good nursery not too far from us (we live on acreage about an hour from town so this was a good find), turns out the owner not only specialises in magnolias but also knows our property as he supplied the previous owners with most of the existing garden plants and trees! So, the good news is that the magnolia, being grown locally, will survive our climate just fine.

It does look a bit lonely atm but we will eventually add some things to the area as the tree matures. My husbands workmates collected what ended up being a very generous fund for us to get a memorial garden bench to put under the tree, and I will probably potter around and add some other plants or a stone pathway or something.

We are just wrapping up winter here and coming into spring, so the tree is starting to flower (it’s a black tulip magnolia so the flowers are the most beautiful colour) and will start to look more like a tree and less like a piles of sticks in the coming months. Squeak is my floofy feline model who is definitely not meant to be out of the cat run but we’ll forgive her :D

It’s been heavy on my heart to start to go through all these dates again. But these dates are the only memories I have with my baby. They aren’t happy or joyous, but I do want to treasure them as the start of my experience with him. It’s the time when I got to love him fiercely for the next three weeks until we found out about the loss. 

It’s also World Childless Week, and the theme today is [comments that hurt](https://worldchildlessweek.net/comments-that-hurt/2018/8/28/little-boys-are-superheroes-in-disguise).

<p>How can one possibly move on to not have children after wanting them so bad? I know adoption is not for me for many reasons and I just want our baby, like all my friends and family get to have. Why can&#39;t I have that? Why is it not getting any easier? Losses are so devastating. How are you all holding up with multiple losses and no living children? I feel like this is the worst kind of punishment. All your hopes are up and then there is nothing but pain. </p>

24,2048,confidence,<praw.reddit.Reddit object at 0x7f12a630cd90>,,ttcafterloss,"Let me start off with ....I obviously recently had a loss. My very FIRST loss.I am 33 - almost 34 years old.  I have lurked this sub for a about a month or so - read through ALOT of stuff.  I am, like I guess alot of posters - looking to feel relieved or something like that.  Not getting a whole lot of reassurance or solid/even halfway answers from doctors.  
Have been TTC with my husband since going off birth control pills in the middle of this past Feb. Obviously ,( like most in this sub maybe) - came the  monthly daily handful of days ovulation tests...testing a few times a day etc.  then the few days before my expected period came the daily pregnancy tests...etc.  same old .   
Worth noting - I was taking temazapam and trazadone for sleeping pills (nightly) and adderall twice a day (once at 1130am and second dose at 4pm)   also i get HORRIBLE migraines - assumably hormone related but sometimes not - i take treximet for those.  
I also have some skin issues/skin allergies - i use ..NOT DAILY but maybe every few days - desonide cream .05% , ketoconazle2% cream for my dermatitis flair ups on my face.                                                                     For acne I use aczone 5% and adapalene gel .3%  - again all these above creams listed are not every day - they are as needed but i thought it might be worth noting.
ANYWAYS - Finally!!! On july 14th - took a pregnancy test - positive!!!                                                                                             I IMMEDIATELY stopped all above listed prescription medicines and creams.  Stopped any over the counter stuff - like heart burn pills etc. 
 I had been using for both pregnancy tests and ovulation tests the cheapo amazon ones - for what its worth,  Also was using the clear blue easy digital ovulation tests....which im not honestly so certain they ever worked.  anyways.  Positive test...FINALLY!!!  I then went out and bought multiple name brand tests and took them - all positive.                                                                                                Called my Dr. - and made my first appointment - according to the date of my last period which was june 11th - she estimated  i was at the time i saw her 9 weeks 3 days approx?  She had me scheduled for a ultrasound -  a week later - then came the begining of what seems like this endless nightmare.  	    									                                          At the ultrasound - it was noted the babies size was a bit over  6 weeks - there was a heartbeat but it was apparently not super strong.   We were obviously devastated.  We were told come back in ten days to recheck to see if there was growth maybe my dates were wrong...in calculations.  Went back after 10 days.....no heartbeat.....and no growth.     		                                          Obviously my husband and me were devastated...im trying to make a long story short here - but the D&C was august 30th - no pain after....only a little bleeding....however about 4/5 days after I started having crippling pain and more bleeding then i had after it was done.  Talked to the dr - she prescribed me 3 days worth of Methylergonovine .2mg and instructed me to have a ultrasound....the ultrasound showed some pregnancy stuff - but my uterus was  thin as it should be - also noted - the lab tested the ""stuff"" removed from my D&C and it showed pregnancy tissue.    I'm left pretty confused by all that - im not sure what was necessary or if all that was aiding to me being  concerned and honestly not knowing what was going on.  I saw the dr for a post op check up on monday and she told me to have another ultrasound and a bloodtest to test HCG....i am waiting for those results currently.                                                                                                       Worth noting I took a pregnancy test 3 days ago and its still a STRONG positive.....                                                                        So after seeing the dr to follow up the D&C on monday - i obviously just had so many questions.                                                                                                                                                                                                                     The why me? What did i do wrong?  What didn't I do right? those kind of things FLOOD my brain right now - the dr just told me a general answer of these things happen ....happens alot...that sort of thing.( The Dr who did the ""procedure"" wasn't  the gyno i see on my normal yearly exams.  She apparently is the one who does this sort of thing and delivers the babies at the particular practice i go to. so i literally never met her before this went down) the dr wasn't terribly ""Warm"" or ....understanding she came off cold to both me and my husband (my husband is not as sensitive as me....but he noticed that she was cold right away) so i right off the bat sort of don't care for her....but she is literally all i have for information right now .....after seeing her i tried asking the normal questions....why me...what i did wrong etc.  but didn't get anything.  she said  ""one miscarriage doesn't warrant a cause for concern...these things happen""   and gave me a prescription for a "" reproductive health, thrombophilia profile, screening""  blood test - which i have not done because I am understanding my insurance doesn't cover ....most of all : I also don't really don't know what that test is?  I do know she only wrote that blood work script because she said its really the only test she can prescribe me to ease my mind.  There was assuming otherwise no reasoning behind having me take that test.
Can anyone shed any light on this test….if they have had it...if I should bother? etc.
SO - with that heavy worded long winded story - (i apologize - i re-wrote this so many times to make it less word-y)  									                                         I guess what im looking for is any similar stories....advice...words of wisdom?!?!?!
I think my main worries are....was my taking that medication listed above...the problem?  Did i do this somehow...I thought i would be ok if i stopped right when i got that positive test.
Is there a recommended....""Cycle day"" I should not take ANY prescription medications or over the counter etc. That is something I really want to know...because I stopped taking the sleeping pills completely , stopped the allergy skin creams....but i do take the adderall currently and I have had a few days with a migraine that i needed my Treximet.                                                                                 So is there a day I should just suck it up and stop and deal with it?  Because i can - if i know what the suggested cycle day is....
And also has anyone had a similair nightmarish story of their very first try at conceiving....stilll even currently im sitting here waiting for the results of my latest ultrasound and the HCG bloodwork...and im currently spotting on and off ....it sucks. I just don't know whats going on with my body.
Thanks in advance guys!!!


**EDIT:**
I got my latest ultrasound and hcg test results back - this time there was nothing seen with the ultrasound and my hcg levels are at 527. So since they are not zero ....the dr is having me do weekly bloodtests :/

*Also* - thanks for the comments/words of support.  I appreciate it....while i knew by posting i wouldn't get the magic answer - but the words of wisdom help.  <3 <3
AND!!! sorry about my wack-a-doo formatting which made reading all that sort of a headache!!

And also has anyone had a similair nightmarish story of their very first try at conceiving....stilll even currently im sitting here waiting for the results of my latest ultrasound and the HCG bloodwork...and im currently spotting on and off ....it sucks. I just don&#39;t know whats going on with my body.
Thanks in advance guys!!!</p>

<p><strong>EDIT:</strong>
I got my latest ultrasound and hcg test results back - this time there was nothing seen with the ultrasound and my hcg levels are at 527. So since they are not zero ....the dr is having me do weekly bloodtests :/</p>

<p><em>Also</em> - thanks for the comments/words of support.  I appreciate it....while i knew by posting i wouldn&#39;t get the magic answer - but the words of wisdom help.  &lt;3 &lt;3
AND!!! sorry about my wack-a-doo formatting which made reading all that sort of a headache!!</p>

35,2048,confidence,<praw.reddit.Reddit object at 0x7f12a630cd90>,,ttcafterloss,"Hi all. I just got back from my follow up at 19 days past my TFMR (at 20 weeks), and I thought maybe what my doctor said could be helpful to anyone who is ever in a similar situation to me.

I asked her if residual hCG would negatively affect anything, if by some fluke we were to get pregnant right away, and she said no. They sent me off with a lab slip to take for my hormone levels and they made sure to code it to the lab tech to repeat until 0, so I didn’t have to continually call and ask for another slip. Make sure you ask for that as well if you are getting your levels monitored.

We were cleared for sex. The pelvic exam was uncomfortable. I was already having a bit of cramping before I got there.

However... she recommended waiting at least 4-6 months to try again. Her reasoning was that the cervix undergoes a lot of trauma during a D&amp;amp;amp;E, and it would put me at higher risk in future pregnancies if I do not wait until my body has healed. She said I would be at greater risk of miscarriage and incompetent cervix, and I would be more likely to need a cerclage early on if the pregnancy stuck.

She also said they would be monitoring my cervix more closely in future pregnancies regardless and would have a cervical exam around 16 weeks next time. She said I could still get genetic testing and cautioned against CVS because of the higher risk to the pregnancy as opposed to the amnio. My only rebuttal is that I would want answers sooner rather than later because I’d like to avoid this kind of grief in future pregnancies if something were to be wrong, but I wouldn’t want to take an unnecessary risk either. I’ll be asking my MFM/GC about it. I will likely forego the NIPT next time and go straight to amnio if not the CVS. I want the whole picture and I have no faith in statistics anymore since my background risk was 1/950, and I ended up being the 1.

She also asked how I was doing emotionally and I relayed that I felt okay the first two weeks but that this one is already much harder. She said she thinks it’s perfectly okay to take 8-12 weeks to grieve and heal but wouldn’t recommend more than that because it’s important to get back into life. So I’ll be taking to my psychiatrist about taking a little more time and ask his opinion. A lot can change in a few weeks, and it’s hard to not know how I’m going to feel. But right now, the thought of going back in three weeks is very overwhelming, and I don’t think I’m ready. Maybe I just need to get on some meds so I can stop thinking about how I’d like to disappear.

Other than that, the appointment was mostly awful, emotionally. There was a woman in the waiting room with her baby. Then, while waiting in my exam room, I could hear through the walls. A nurse asked a woman if the baby was moving, then she was getting to listen to her baby’s heartbeat on the Doppler. That should have been me. I should have been talking about my squirmy little baby and rubbing my belly and getting to hear his heartbeat. It was very hard.

But, to finish on a positive note, our nurse was so, so wonderful. After the doctor was done and she brought the paperwork, she cried for me and with me. She said, “I just wanted to say I’m so so sorry. You’ve had such a rough go these last few months and it is so incredibly unfair. I can tell you are so, so smart and you have had to learn a whole new language that you shouldn’t have to. I know there’s nothing I can say to make this better, but I’m just so sad for you. I hope this next pregnancy goes well for you both because I know you’ll be amazing parents.” I cried, it touched my heart so much. She said she hoped I’d be calling in 4 months with a positive test and that if I can’t stomach going to the follow up appointment because it’s too upsetting for me, then that’s perfectly okay. I appreciated that a lot. The appointment is scheduled two days before my EDD in January, so I’m not sure how I’m going to feel about it. Awful, if I had to put money on it, but I’ll likely go.

Hope this helps someone. Thanks again to this community for being so awesome and helpful. I hate that I’m here, but I’m glad this community exists so that we can all heal together and feel a little less lonely.

**Nurse**: Well, you have a wonderful afternoon. [click]

I hope this next pregnancy goes well for you both because I know you’ll be amazing parents.” I cried, it touched my heart so much. She said she hoped I’d be calling in 4 months with a positive test and that if I can’t stomach going to the follow up appointment because it’s too upsetting for me, then that’s perfectly okay. I appreciated that a lot. The appointment is scheduled two days before my EDD in January, so I’m not sure how I’m going to feel about it. Awful, if I had to put money on it, but I’ll likely go.</p>

<p>Hope this helps someone. Thanks again to this community for being so awesome and helpful. I hate that I’m here, but I’m glad this community exists so that we can all heal together and feel a little less lonely.</p>

<p>ETA my MFM office called and I had an appointment still on the schedule for a fetal echocardiogram and anatomy scan.</p>

<p><strong>Nurse</strong>: Hi do you realize you missed your appointment?</p>

<p><strong>Me</strong>: I terminated 3 weeks ago. I figured someone would have taken care of that.</p>

<p><strong>Nurse</strong>: ............Oh. ............Uh...... Well, they didn’t........... Uh........... I’m sorry I don’t know what to say... [laughs nervously]</p>

<p><strong>Me</strong>: ........</p>

<p><strong>Nurse</strong>: Well, you have a wonderful afternoon. [click]</p>

<p>I’m gonna call the other nurse I got to know well and apologize and have her explain the situation to the other nurse so they don’t think I’m a jerk. Maybe I shouldn’t care but I do. I’m also gonna tell them what they told me at my regular OB office.</p>

Second miscarriage for me. First was Christmas day 2015. It took almost a full year before we were able to conceive again, even with charting and tracking. I spent a lot of time lurking and commenting here.

We decided to start trying again a few months ago. Got pregnant almost immediately. I was in shock. It was an off cycle and I ovulated really late. 

Went in for my first appointment, 6+5 based on lmp but only 4+2  from ovulation. The urine test was negative so they sent me for bloodwork. It was positive but levels were low. 

Then, I started bleeding over the weekend. Pelvic exam today confirmed that I was losing it. Blood work was taken but my hcg levels were only 21 a few days ago.

It's been more than the recommended number of cycles I'm supposed to wait to TTC again, but I'm struggling to know when I am emotionally ready to. After the hardest choice of my life, we lost our baby girl at 22 weeks in mid May after learning of her severe congenital heart defect, and I can't help but worry it was because of something I did wrong. I got the flu when I was only 4 weeks along, and I know that really increases your chances of developing CHD. I feel like I want everything to be in perfect condition before we TTC again, I want to make sure I'm the best little baby house I can be, but I know that my standard of perfection isn't realistic. 

My husband and I are so ready to be parents, but I don't know how to get over the fear of losing the next baby and how to myself through the potential for so much heartbreak again. Before I was pregnant I always KNEW there was a possibility something could go horribly wrong, but having lived through it really adds a lot of weight to the reality. It's much harder to ignore this time around. So much of the process is out of my control and I'm afraid my body will never know how to make a healthy baby and all this could happen again. Our family and friends are already asking when we will try. I've told my husband I at least want to wait til after we have to travel for a wedding in October because I got the flu while pregnant after I traveled to NYC for my 30th birthday.

I was just thinking about my monthly bumper group and how sad it makes me that I’m not there anymore. They’re all going on and will get their babies... and I don’t. My baby is sitting in an urn on my mantle. It fills me with this weird panic feeling, knowing that they’re getting to experience all the things I wanted to experience. They’re feeling the kicks and the hiccups, watching their bellies grow, starting to make plans, finishing their nurseries, taking hospital tours, doing birthing classes, going shopping, planning baby showers, dealing with annoying people wanting to touch them... I could go on. I’m so happy for them but I’m also so. fucking. angry. I feel like my life has just been ripped from me, my world will never be the same, and yet it continues on for everyone else just like it’s supposed to. I feel totally broken and like there’s no coming back from this. I feel trapped in a totally miserable and helpless situation. No matter which way things go, I’m fucked.

Some of you know my story better and I have written about it so many times. I’m on medical leave until October because I needed time to heal after my TFMR. I’m getting paid. But I don’t want to go back to work because I hate teaching; every year toward the end of the first semester, I start thinking I should check myself into the hospital for my depression because I think about crashing my car into a tree in my way to work every day. I know that’s coming for me again.... I know I’m already there now. I don’t want to go back; it makes me feel sick to my stomach and fills my chest with this cold feeling of dread when I think  about it, but I have to go because I have bills and I need insurance. My husband is going back to school to finish his degree so he can only work part time, but he doesn’t have a job yet, but he’s coming to the end of his unemployment. We would be so screwed if I got pregnant again right now. If I found a new job, I wouldn’t get FMLA. I also can’t take something that will be a massive pay cut or with worse benefits. I am just feeling so much pressure from all sides and I feel like I’m being crushed. I hate my life and I want out, or at least to be able to just skip to the part where I don’t want to just be swallowed up by my bed and disappear.

I know it makes more sense for my husband and I to start trying later, when our financial and career issues are at least closer to being sorted, but I can’t help but want to be pregnant again now. Despite knowing that we would likely be way more stressed, I can’t shake it. How can I know that it’s logistically better to wait and yet still be devastated by it?

I am so frustrated by how everything that’s happened has screwed everything else up in our lives and I just can’t deal. EVERYTHING is a reminder of what I’ve lost. Sex isn’t the same (even though we’ve only had it once since the loss, see my comment from this morning in the daily thread). Tracking and charting isn’t the same. Getting my period won’t be the same. Looking in the mirror isn’t the same. Just being in the world and seeing other pregnant people or hearing about pregnancy isn’t the same. Everything fucking hurts, all the time. I just want it to stop.

For the record also, I’m in therapy and I see a psychiatrist. I’m going back on meds soon probably even though I hate the side effects.

The last time I had it colored and cut was about a week before I found out about my MMC. I’ve tried to make the appointment ten times but finally gritted my teeth and made it last week. I’m a real estate agent, so I can’t be walking around with roots and Lady Godiva hair, which has been my current look for a couple of months now, because I’m sad and couldn’t bear the thought of cutting off my pregnancy hair. Which I haven’t really verbalized to anyone, and is probably crazy, but I know y’all will understand. My hairstylist is an absolute saint. I’ve used her for about seven years now exclusively, she owns her own small salon and is a couple of years older than me so we’ve spent a lot of our twenties together. She did my hair for my wedding, she cuts my husband’s hair, my dad’s hair, and my sister’s hair. I knew she knew, because with that many people adjacent to me seeing her, and because she’s so kind, I know she would’ve asked them about me/how my pregnancy was coming.

&#x200B;

Today I stood up for myself.

I have a problem with confrontation. It takes up a lot of emotional energy, so I avoid things that might be awkward or make me feel like I'm burdening someone else. It means I stay quiet a lot. Even when I know the end result will make me uncomfortable.

Now, don't get me wrong, I can argue for myself and my wellbeing with my husband (even though he's not much of an issue anyway), and I've been very good about vocalizing my needs and feelings post-loss, pre-trying again, and through the process of trying again. But, with other people, I hold back. I just don't feel like my needs are more important than the needs of others.

I do try to take care of myself the best ways I know how. I work out, I get my nails done, I eat well, and I participate in a responsible amount of retail therapy (along with actual therapy). But working out has been my biggest sanctuary in these past few months. I recently started going to a Friday women's yoga class, and I've become incredibly fond of it. It's a super gentle practice, and the class has become my time to connect back with my body and forgive myself for everything that's been going on. This brings me to today.

At the beginning of my women's yoga class, the instructor let us know that a member of the class (who had given birth right before I started going) had emailed her asking if she could come back and bring her baby. She opened this up to the class so we could give our opinions on whether or not this would be distracting or something we would be okay with. One of the women, who's been in this class for a few years, said she wouldn't mind. Another woman commented that she comes to this class to get some time away from her kids and that it would be distracting for her.

In my heart, I knew I wouldn't be okay with this. I'm trying really hard to accept that other pregnant women and newborns are a part of life, and even though I didn't get to become a mom this summer, other women did. I know it's normal in our circumstances, and I completely understand it, but I don't want to get to a place where I become resentful of other pregnant women and new moms. I accept I have to deal with them in the real world, but I'm not ready to deal with a newborn in my yoga class when I'm trying to find peace in the fact that I don't have one of my own and I should.

I wasn't ready to voice this concern with the entire class, but by the end of it, I worked up the nerve to tell the instructor privately. I told her that I understood this woman is looking for support and community in a time that can be really isolating, but that I'm working through a miscarriage and having more trouble than I expected trying again. I told her though I know I'm coming from a place of selfishness, that this is my space for dealing with the hurt that's come with my shit, and a newborn in the class would be a little overwhelming for me. She was super understanding and told me she completely respected my opinion, then gave me a hug.

After I got home, I realized even if this woman comes to class with her baby, I'd be okay because at least I spoke up for myself. Actually addressing my needs is a huge amount of growth for me. It's not that I need my Friday yoga class to remain my safe space, I just need to know that I'm heard.

I thought pregnancy and motherhood would be a tremendous opportunity for personal growth, and when I miscarried it made me feel so stuck. I guess I'm growing anyway, even though it's not in the way I wanted, and I'm really proud of myself for that.

And my mom wants me to focus on the fact that I am alive and that maybe it wasn’t time for a baby. But I am sad. I feel loss. And I don’t know how to express it or get over it. I also don’t want anyone to think I’m being overly dramatic about what happened. I have been burying it down and burying myself in work and life. But I feel like I’m starting to break myself down. </p>

<p>I’m sorry if this is rambling, but it definitely felt good to being to express what I’m going through. Thanks to anyone that read through!</p>

84,2048,confidence,<praw.reddit.Reddit object at 0x7f12a630cd90>,,ttcafterloss,"Hi Ladies,

I've only posted here a couple times, but I lurk quite a bit. 

I've had 2 miscarriages this year, one in March, and one in July. Although it was hard after both, I was having a really hard time dealing after my second loss. My OB suggested counseling- at first I didn't think it was for me, but then my SIL (who went through some different fertility issues) told me that she had gone and it really helped her. I found a practice that is focused on dealing with women who have fertility issues, have suffered pregnancy losses, and focus on other pregnancy and newborn-related issues along with family. 

First and foremost- if you are struggling, I highly suggest going to counseling. It's not a magical solution to your problems, but is there to help you find the tools to better understand/cope with/deal with what is going on. 

Ok here's the best tool my counselor has given me. One of the things I was most struggling with  was feeing very alone and isolated because I couldn't verbalize how I was feeling. The depths of sorrow and pain and awfulness I was feeling just couldn't be put into words in a way that I felt I could adequately explain how I was feeling so that people could understand what I was feeling and why I was so bad. After we established that I was, indeed, sureounded by a wonderful husband, and family, and friends who would be there for me if I asked, and I explained the above, my counselor hit me with the Big One. 

""Tell me more about this feeling that you're having that you need to explain yourself and your feelings to people. Why can't you just tell them that you feel like absolute shit, and that you need them to just sit there quietly and let you cry or let you talk, not giving affirmations, but just be there with you?""

I was blown away by that. That was literally never an option for me, because I just hadn't thought of trying it. 

Literally that night I used those words with my husband, and within the next couple days with my closest friend. It was huge. It was hard. But wow, was it wonderful to say and immediately get my point across without worrying about their comprehension of my feelings. 

It hasn't made the pain go away, it won't bring my babes back, but it has made it possible to feel supported and not feel so alone. 

I know everyone's experience is different, and that you may not be having the same hard time with asking for support as me, but if this can help any one of you as much as it has helped me, then please, take this and use it. 

Continue to take the time you need to love yourselves, whether that be a couple months, a couple days, or a couple years. Ask for help if you need it- don't let words get in the way.

 So to start I, myself am not trying right now. I still sub to the page because I like seeing others get their BFPs and the support this group offers. 
After the loss of my twins at 12 weeks in July, at my 2 week post op appointment I decided to get on birth control. I don't want to go through another loss. I also lost my son in 2017 - a neonatal death. 

Now, of course I am rethinking being on birth control just because I cant help but think of these ladies (like some of you I am sure) who have been through miscarriage after miscarriage and finally succeeded, and be hopeful and inspired by them. 

I still can't bring myself to talk to my husband about it, or even think on it too much myself. I cannot imagine going through another pregnancy, dreading every appointment, fighting every ""bad feeling"" I have, tip toe-ing around all foods, missing out on swimming and physical activity and doing countless searches to make sure the prenatal I'm taking is the best, plus extra folic and iron and Vit. D. just to end up with empty arms and a broken heart. Again.

<p>I still can&#39;t bring myself to talk to my husband about it, or even think on it too much myself. I cannot imagine going through another pregnancy, dreading every appointment, fighting every &quot;bad feeling&quot; I have, tip toe-ing around all foods, missing out on swimming and physical activity and doing countless searches to make sure the prenatal I&#39;m taking is the best, plus extra folic and iron and Vit. D. just to end up with empty arms and a broken heart. Again. </p>

<p>So finally, back my question, how do you brave ladies who&#39;ve been through subsequent losses, or multiple losses keep going? Any input is appreciated. </p>

We lost our baby at 14 weeks after being told heartbeat was gone around 9 (yes my doctor was awful). The week culminated in an emergency D&C and left my partner and I reeling. The months that followed were hard to say the least. Now, we have finally decided we would like to try again but I am so incredibly scared. I never want to feel like I did after losing our love again. So, for starters I am looking for some advice on how to mentally prepare myself and not obsess over every detail. Anything would help.

Secondly, I have some questions I'm hoping some more experienced women can help me with. I went back on the BCP for 6 months after loss. I had a normal period (Aug 2-6), then started my new pack (Tues Aug 7). I took Tuesday-Friday (4 pills) until partner and I had a talk and decided we were done with the pill and wanted to ""get back out there"". Today, it is Sept 3 and according to my app I'm 4 days late. Now, I need to know if this is because of stopping the pill mid pack or for other reasons. I have stopped before and simply gotten my period but this time not even any spotting. I've had a few cramps that I thought would result in bleeding and nothing. Now, my nipples are feeling extremely sensitive. As a side note, with or without the pill I have always had a regular 28 day cycle. I dont want to overreact because I realize this is most likely because of the pill but it's hard to chalk it up to that when my nerves about getting pregnant are so present. Can anyone give me some insight on this? I know we are all different in our cycles and bodies but the longer I go without a period the more anxious I get.

So, I have had two misscarriages in a year. One in Sept 2017 and one in July 2018. I'm 26 and in the UK. Don't smoke at all, drink rarely (since I found out last time I haven't had a drink since May), healthy, starting the gym again. No health issues, apart from asthmatic (but that's controlled now and don't need inhalers unless I need them). 

It's been a month since my last one and I've been on for last few days. Seems like my cycle is still in sync with my app I'm using, which is handy.

I'm just wondering, when has everyone TTC after a loss? Is trying straight after one cycle too soon? 

I'm feeling okay myself, mentally, physically and emotionally. I just feel like I'm more determine now to try again (I'm very stubborn and won't let anything stop me that's within my limits). My thought process is that my next pregnancy will be a two way road. I'll have either my happy ending that I want, or I'll be on a road to find answers to why it's happening.

Knowing that's a pretty significant diagnosis, I have been reading everything I can get my hands on and spent almost the entire day with specialists and my OB. Here's what I know. 

&#x200B;

\- I am 11w 3d based on dating scan, 12w based on LMP.  Baby seems to be developing at a normal rate.

\- Ultrasound at 10w was overwhelmingly positive. Baby was dancing around, my doctor even played some music and toggled the screen to make baby dance to the music. Heartbeat around 168.

\- The Panorama test came back positive for Trisomy 18. Based on my maternal age (34) and the efficacy of the test, that's a 35% chance that it's a true positive. 

\- I went for an ultrasound today with a MFM and the findings were: NT of 4.8 and thickened abdominal areas called Anasarca. These two things combined is called Hydrops Fetalis. Heartbeat at 167 and lots of bouncing around.

\- Anasarca/Hydrops Fetalis is one of the markers for Trisomy 18 and is considered very serious/terminal as well. About 20% of babies with this condition make it to term. Most are extremely ill at birth.

\- I chose not to get the CVS today as the MFM doctor was basically 100% certain that what he saw on the scan combined with the Panorama results were confirming a diagnosis. 

\- I talked with my OB and he told me he would do the CVS, if it were him, just to be 1000 percent sure. He also told me that a D+C or a D+E would be much easier at 11w than it would be at 15 to wait for a CVS, the results, and possibly an amniocentesis. 

\- Since the heartbeat is strong and the fluid build up isn't in the heart yet, it likely will not naturally miscarry for some time. Could be many weeks - could go full term. There's no real way to know. 

\- This \[study\]([https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20925041](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20925041)) determined Ultrasound was the most effective way to diagnose Trisomy 18. At <14 weeks, the results are 92.7% correct in diagnosing the abnormality. That, coupled with my 35% risk from the Panorama test, they say it is almost a certainty.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

My questions... 

\- Has anyone ever had anasarca on an ultrasound and have it be a fluke?

\- Has anyone ever had a thickened NT on an ultrasound and have it be a fluke? 

\- Has anyone had these combined diagnostics and have it be a fluke? (Positive blood test, NT thickened, and Anasarca)

\- How do you become 100% certain that you want to TFMR? 

&#x200B;

I think I have hope because of the high heart rate, normal fetal size, and the amazing amount of movement - and something inside of me just saying everything is ok and to wait it out. But everything they're telling me is pretty damming. I think I'm going to opt for the CVS on Tuesday (damn holiday weekend!!)  and see what they have to say. If they come back with bad news, I will proceed with termination. 

&#x200B;

To say I'm devastated is an understatement. I absolutely don't want to have to make this decision and am heartbroken, to say the least.

<p>- The Panorama test came back positive for Trisomy 18. Based on my maternal age (34) and the efficacy of the test, that&#39;s a 35% chance that it&#39;s a true positive. </p>

<p>- I went for an ultrasound today with a MFM and the findings were: NT of 4.8 and thickened abdominal areas called Anasarca. These two things combined is called Hydrops Fetalis. Heartbeat at 167 and lots of bouncing around.</p>

<p>- Anasarca/Hydrops Fetalis is one of the markers for Trisomy 18 and is considered very serious/terminal as well. About 20% of babies with this condition make it to term. Most are extremely ill at birth.</p>

<p>- I chose not to get the CVS today as the MFM doctor was basically 100% certain that what he saw on the scan combined with the Panorama results were confirming a diagnosis. </p>

<p>- I talked with my OB and he told me he would do the CVS, if it were him, just to be 1000 percent sure. He also told me that a D+C or a D+E would be much easier at 11w than it would be at 15 to wait for a CVS, the results, and possibly an amniocentesis. </p>

<p>- Since the heartbeat is strong and the fluid build up isn&#39;t in the heart yet, it likely will not naturally miscarry for some time. Could be many weeks - could go full term. There&#39;s no real way to know. </p>

<p>- This [study](<a href=""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20925041"">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20925041</a>) determined Ultrasound was the most effective way to diagnose Trisomy 18. At &lt;14 weeks, the results are 92.7% correct in diagnosing the abnormality. That, coupled with my 35% risk from the Panorama test, they say it is almost a certainty.</p>

<p>&#x200B;</p>

<p>&#x200B;</p>

<p>My questions... </p>

<p>- Has anyone ever had anasarca on an ultrasound and have it be a fluke?</p>

<p>- Has anyone ever had a thickened NT on an ultrasound and have it be a fluke? </p>

<p>- Has anyone had these combined diagnostics and have it be a fluke? (Positive blood test, NT thickened, and Anasarca)</p>

<p>- How do you become 100% certain that you want to TFMR? </p>

<p>&#x200B;</p>

<p>I think I have hope because of the high heart rate, normal fetal size, and the amazing amount of movement - and something inside of me just saying everything is ok and to wait it out. But everything they&#39;re telling me is pretty damming. I think I&#39;m going to opt for the CVS on Tuesday (damn holiday weekend!!)  and see what they have to say. If they come back with bad news, I will proceed with termination. </p>

<p>&#x200B;</p>

<p>To say I&#39;m devastated is an understatement. I absolutely don&#39;t want to have to make this decision and am heartbroken, to say the least. </p>

<p>&#x200B;</p>

<p>Thank you for your thoughts and words of wisdom. I would love to hear your experiences if you have them. Thank you.</p>

108,2048,confidence,<praw.reddit.Reddit object at 0x7f12a630cd90>,,ttcafterloss,"Hello all. This is my first post here. I have been feeling a greater sense of loss in the past few days and wanted to acknowledge some of my feelings.

​

I have had two miscarriages. My first pregnancy resulted in a missed miscarriage in May 2017. I was 19w3d when my midwife could not find the heartbeat with a doppler. A few anxious hours later, an emergency ultrasound confirmed our little babe no longer had a heartbeat. I fortunately had my detailed ultrasound scheduled for the very next day and we were able to get a few more details. The baby was measuring 14 weeks (which was a mere 4 days after I had heard and recorded the heartbeat). I had a D&C the following day and so began my journey of constant heartache. I had some testing done to see if we could get any answers and the doctor mentioned 'her' in the mix. We hadn't planned on finding out the sex of the baby until birth; that was another hard thing to hear. However, it's nice to think of her. Our daughter was due October 21, 2017.

​

That pregnancy was a surprise. A month after the loss, I landed a great job and decided to hold off on TTC until I felt more stable emotionally. We decided to start trying again in June 2018. I took two at-home pregnancy tests that both resulted in faint positive lines after our first month of trying. I tried not to get too excited, but I was entertaining the idea of our 'rainbow' baby. Unfortunately, within six days, I had quite a bit of bleeding and a blood test confirmed I was not pregnant. This miscarriage was at just over 5 weeks.

​

So here I am ... one missed miscarriage, one miscarriage, and I did not get pregnant while TTC over this past month. And I'm just confused. I feel confused by my body. In my first pregnancy, my body held on for 5 weeks longer than the baby was alive, and in my second pregnancy, it barely held on for a week that I knew of the pregnancy. I just don't know what it is going to be like for me when I carry a baby, if I ever do. It's just so hard.

​

Thankfully, I have the most supportive husband - however, this has definitely impacted me more negatively than it has him. I did go to a few counselling sessions with the first loss. I mainly was opposed to continuing based on finances, but it is something I reasonably can afford if I so choose.

​

I appreciate you taking the time to read my long post. I have felt a greater sense of grief in the past few days and it is nice to share my feelings amongst a community that understands.

This morning at 9:30 I went for an emergency ultrasound, baby measured 12+3. No heartbeat. Very low amniotic fluid. To say that I was crushed would be an understatement.

Today I received the call I'd been dreading since Tuesday. My rapid FISH results came back with all cells positive for Trisomy 13. 

My doctor says that, had it been a partial positive, there would be hope that my son was not affected, but a full cell positive is pretty damning. Part of me wants an amnio, fully knowing that it will tell me that my son has T13 and only prolonging the time I sit in limbo, pregnant but not expecting a child. Prolonging the time it takes me to grieve while I have to keep positive as a stay at home parent to an active, oblivious toddler. 

I'm furious at my doctor. He was dismissive, citing the 93% chance that my NIPT positive was false because I'm only 24 and talking optimistically about the situation. The ultrasound didn't feel thorough, and returned totally normal results, which I found through online research to be abnormal. A borderline wide NT measurement paired with a high heart rate are considered markers, but I believe he ignored them because there was such a high likelihood that all was well. He hadn't even reviewed the whole scan before telling us that everything looked normal. Only later, when given the report, did I learn about the wide NT and high heart rate, as well as the fact that they didn't even get good pictures of his head, which would offer important insight into the diagnosis. 

I'm angry, but also I know that my doctor was not wrong in doing a lot of what he did. I'm struggling so much to separate what stems from plain anger, and what should actually have been done differently. 

In turn, it's hard for me to decide the best course of action. My gut says to get another ultrasound and look again to find abnormalities, if there are none, then get an amnio. But I'm struggling to decide whether that will help, whether I just want to see my son again and whether that will only pain me further. There is a virtually 0% chance that a full cell positive will lead to a normal amnio. But there are edge cases. Full placental mosaicism is a thing. Do I think I'm one of these edge cases? No way. But I'm afraid of terminating only to discover, or endlessly wonder whether I was. 

On top of that, I know that the waiting will make my life more stressful, and in turn make my daughter's life more stressful. I'd be terminating a week before a solo international flight with a toddler. Our whole TTC plan will be shoved way back, which is petty but just an additional stress.

As of now, I have an appointment with the MFM specialist in order to discuss the diagnosis and my options, specifically further testing. I know he will advise against it. I know my husband wants to move on, so do I. Maybe I'm just afraid of letting go. Either way, I'm almost certainly joining you all.

If anyone who is / has been in my shoes has any advice, I'd really love to hear. I'm paralyzed right now.

A few years ago, I went to the gyno to see why and I was told that I didn’t have PCOS (I don’t have cysts on my ovaries) but was pre-diabetic.

I’ve since gained some weight and have been less active, and they have gone back to being unpredictable.

It's been a little over a week since I officially joined the club every woman and partner dreads. 

It's been exactly 7 days since my D&C and 9 days since the miscarriage... I am just at a loss. My little one was over 13 weeks along, and we thought we were in the clear. I am already mother to a toddler which means the OBGYN approached this pregnancy a bit more lackadaisically....or so I felt.

&#x200B;

Everything was going smoothly-- we were on target and I was always measuring where I should be. In our excitement, we decided to schedule the DNA free test as we couldn't wait for the gender; regardless, I am a pragmatist. On Tuesday (21st) I decided to bring out my doppler for a quick check. Our appointment was on Thursday and, this early in the pregnancy, I still had a good measure for where the heartbeat would be. Unlike my first pregnancy, I'd really only used the doppler once or twice, as it's still too early to reliably find the heartbeat.

Still, there was dead silence. Nothing. Let alone the galloping heartbeat, there was no ""whooshing"" placenta sound. Immediately my heart fell to my feet. Resisting the urge to panic, I continued trying... still, nothing. My husband came home from the gym and I calmly explained to him that I had a concern with the doppler. He decides to run out at midnight for a new battery, just in case. Of course it makes no difference.

&#x200B;

We both do our best to calm one another, but I cannot sleep; once he and the baby are down, I pull out the doppler once more. Still that fucking silence. Internally I beg and plead...please little bean. Please let me be wrong! With tears pouring down my face, I put the doppler away. I allow myself to cry in the bathroom. To mourn. I lie near my toddler, just holding his hand as he sleeps. During this time I also delete all my ""bump tracker"" apps and the like.

When husband awakens, I let him know I think we should expect the worst. I learned from my last OBGYN that I would never again tell my doc that I use the doppler. I understand that women can be wrong, and they can panic, but I am a realist. The machine helped give me peace and comfort during my last pregnancy (anterior placenta,) where I never felt the baby move. My last OBGYN went on a tirade about dopplers and ultrasound companies, and told me they were for vanity.

I feared telling the doctor I was using a doppler, in the possibility they would encourage me to stay home. At 7:30am we managed to catch a nurse on the phone and I told her I was cramping/spotting. She says I should relax and put my feet up. I thank her for the suggestion, apologize, and let her know I'd really like to come in for a heartbeat check. I've never done this. Not now and never with my last pregnancy. She says she'll see where they can squeeze me in. She checks with the doctor, this wonderful man, and he tells me to come in whenever I can. I let her know it'll be 5 minutes.

Once we're there, we're seen pretty quickly. The doctor does an internal check and verifies that the fundal height is on target, 13 weeks. He pulls out his doppler and finds nothing. This doesn't surprise me... he's been pretty shitty at finding it before.

He gives up and reiterates that I am really on target, but if I would like an ultrasound, they can schedule me in. The tech is at the main office, 20 minutes away. Is that OK? ""Yes"" husband and I say in unison. I thank him profusely and off we go. My OB managed to get us a 9 am appointment. It's 8:30 now and I am so grateful. We race to the location and we're taken in immediately. It's the same ultrasound tech who did our gestational appointment at 7 weeks... she remembers me and is a bit surprised as to why we're getting another US so quickly...she keeps talking, but I am tuning her out. I try to be polite... I think I managed to smile and make a joke. I don't fully remember.

She finally puts the wand in my stomach, and there's my baby. She/he is perfect, looks like they should, but I immediately can tell my baby has died. There is no movement, no giddy kicking like with my son. No somersaults. No bouncing. The little one floats in the amniotic fluid...drifting. It's curled up. Wrong. I look at my husband and shake my head quietly. Tears stream down our faces. My husband managed to ask, beg really, whether she could find the heartbeat. Of course she can't answer. We know this. She quickly mentions needing the doctor to check the scan... when the door shuts I apologize to my husband that we're here. I am so sorry, but this baby has passed. We're crying and holding hands. We tell each other we'll be OK as we quietly sob.

The nurse and doctor return together. The doctor just stands by while the tech shows us where the heartbeat should be. They are so kind. There are tears in the doctor's eyes, and I can see her face in front of me now. She looks deeply into my eyes and she says, ""I am so sorry."" I tell her it's OK, out of female habit, I think. I will never forget the look on my husband's face. He looked up at the ceiling and his face was just filled with grief. Whether subconsciously or intentionally I'll never know, but he immediately took our son out of his stroller and held him. They took us to a consulting room and we began delivering the news to our immediate family.

On Thursday, instead of our DNA test, I was having my D&C. At surgery I was surrounded by nurses who each apologized to me, as they read my chart. Although breaking, my heart fills with such gratitude and love when I think of these women. They shared their losses with me from 30/40 years ago and we mourned together.

This is where I am now. One week out from the D&C and so eager to be pregnant again. Eager and dreading. Missed miscarriage. 13 weeks, 3 days. I find myself fluttering between sadness and acceptance. My heart breaks over again for the women who have gone through this multiple times, for the women of stillborn children. I say to myself that I will take this pain. If I accept it and move forward, will the universe spare me from future child loss? Irrational, I know.

Thank you for listening. I'm sorry I wrote so much-- it felt good to let it out.

I noticed the pink bleeding this morning when I went to the bathroom; had more when I used the bathroom at work.  It's not a lot; only noticeable on TP and its very light pink. 

I don't even know if I'm pregnant because I'm in the two week waiting period. However, I don't normally spot and my periods are solidly 5 days long with no bleeding in between.

D&C at what would have been 11 weeks on July 23. No complications. I have had no signs of ovulation or a period. It is 5 weeks since the D&C, and I was told it can take 4-6 weeks for a period.

My hcg was less than 10k right before the D&C. The highest beta I got was 23K a week prior to the D&C, so it was already falling. On Aug 8 (2 weeks post D&C) it is was 31, and yesterday on Aug 28 (5 weeks post D&C) it was 3.

Previous to this, I had a 28 day, consistent cycle, with lots of ewcm for several days each time in the middle of the cycle. When I have gone off the pill in the past (4 years ago), it took several months for me to get my cycle back...and this was helped along with myo-inositol, and if I remember correctly possibly some vitex or dong quai....however I believe it was the inositol that did the trick. I have stayed on the inositol (stopped when I found I was pregnant) and started taking it again as soon as the mmc was confirmed. Basically I am worried that since hbc works by tricking your body into thinking it's pregnant, since I actually was pregnant, my period could take a while to come back without help.

I am going to my naturopath today for some advice, and will see a doctor once it has been more than 6 weeks. I am wondering what in your experience has worked for you or others to either:

1. induce ovulation, with your body having a 'real'  period 2 weeks after, or
2. to induce a period to jump start your own cycle, with your body ovulating the following cycle and having a normal period.
3. Or if you have tried more non-traditional medicine to re-balance your hormones (e.g. myo-inositol, etc).

EDIT: forgot to add, I am also interested to hear what tests your doc may have ran to see what your body was up to (e.g. FSH, LH, progesterone, estradiol, etc)

It is also an area for those in early pregnancy or pregnancy limbo to post (prior to/instead of moving to r/PregnancyAfterLoss). Please try to use spoiler tags (spoiler tags: > ! text goes here ! < without the spaces) when discussing pregnancy beyond positive test results.

This thread will be posted every Monday and remain stickied for the week, so you can post any day of the week. 

 **Please share positive pregnancy tests (BFPs) ONLY in this thread. Do not make a separate self-post about a BFP/subsequent pregnancy or post about it in the TTC daily thread.** 

 The purpose of this weekly post is so users can easily get an update on others' results. Also, as our Alumni move on to r/PregnancyAfterLoss, you can know who may be moving and keep track of them if you wish.

I’m wondering if anyone else has done something like this and what you chose to do.  How has it impacted you, eg comforting or reminding you of your grief, etc? Do you have any other ideas to serve this purpose?
