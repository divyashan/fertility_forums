4,2048,confidence,<praw.reddit.Reddit object at 0x7f12a630cd90>,,ttcafterloss,"Levi was born on February 22, 2019 at 3:46am. He weighed 4.4 ounces (125 grams). I will love him and miss him and his brother for the rest of my life.

This was the second 2nd trimester loss for my husband and me. Here's a link to my previous [intro post](https://www.reddit.com/r/ttcafterloss/comments/801qyw/mmc_at_19_weeks/) about my first loss at 19 weeks.

TLDR for that post: MMC discovered at 19 weeks during what was supposed to be joint gender reveal scans at a private ultrasound studio with my BIL and SIL (who had an EDD a few weeks behind me) with all of my immediate family in attendance. I was induced and my first son was born the next day on February 4, 2018.

Month’s after our first loss, my husband and I finally decided on naming our first son Ezra. Losing him was the most painful thing I had ever been through. We were totally blindsided as I had a boring, standard pregnancy with our first (a girl), who was born in August 2015. The time after our first loss was dark. Going back to work and realizing everyone else’s world had kept spinning as usual while my whole world had shattered was so hard. My sister-in-law and a close friend were pregnant at the time and our due dates were all within two months of each other. My LC and their older children are all close and I was so excited that we would all soon have another set of babies who would grow up together. After we lost Ezra, I was initially able to spend time around them but as time passed, their growing bellies became constant reminders of my loss. I could no longer bear to be in the same room as them and going to church also became too much for me with all of the other pregnant women and newborns there.

We never got any solid answers as to why we lost Ezra. We weren’t offered any genetic testing while in the hospital and I didn’t think to ask for it until it was too late. Testing was done on the placenta but it came back normal. My OB ordered blood work for me to check for thrombophilias but she was not concerned by the results. She informed that she would have me take baby aspirin for my next pregnancy as a precaution. I did have positive results for heterozygous MTHFR so I decided to start taking prenatals with methylfolate instead of folic acid because I figured it couldn’t hurt.

My husband and I began to TTC after my first period in March. Pregnancy had never happened quickly for us. After about six months, I started planning on pursuing fertility testing at the beginning of 2019 if I was not pregnant by then. Much to my surprise, I got a positive pregnancy test at the end of November. As soon as I saw that line appear, my heart immediately started to race. I didn’t see a new pregnancy as an opportunity to bring home a baby, but an opportunity to have my heart broken again. 

Other than a few minor concerns, this pregnancy was much like the last, in that everything was fine until, suddenly, it wasn’t. Growth was always spot on at each ultrasound. My NT scan and and second trimester blood work done at an MFM’s office at 13 weeks were all normal. just like last time. My OB decided to have the MFM do my anatomy scan this time to be cautious. The MFM also had me come in for an additional ultrasound at her office at 15 weeks because she didn’t want me going too long without any check ups since I was near the time frame of my last loss. I started to feel a little more hopeful with this extra oversight.

When I was about 12 weeks, I purchased a home doppler. After I practiced using it a few times, I was always able to find baby’s heartbeat pretty quickly. We knew that Ezra passed sometime between my last OB appointment at 15 weeks and 19 weeks. I had no way of knowing since it was too early for consistent movement and I had no other worrisome symptoms. Being able to listen to this new baby’s heartbeat anytime the anxiety crept up on me was so comforting. 

On Monday, February 18, when I was 16+6, I used the doppler that morning and noticed that the baby’s heartbeat sounded faster than normal. The heart rate reading never was accurate from the doppler so I counted it and came up with about 200 bpm. It had always been right around 160 prior to that, according to my doppler and ultrasounds. I called my OB’s nurse line and scheduled an ultrasound for that afternoon. At the ultrasound, the baby’s heartbeat was around 180 and the baby was still measuring on track. My normal OB was out of the office that day but a midwife reviewed the scan and assured us that everything was normal. During the ultrasound, we also found out the baby was a boy!  I was so happy to know the baby’s gender. We didn’t find out with Ezra until after he was born so it helped me feel closer to this baby to find out while he was alive. My husband and I immediately started trying to come up with names because boy names have always been hard for us to come up with.

The excitement was short lived. I continued checking on the baby’s heartbeat at home. On Tuesday it was around 170 bpm. On Wednesday evening after I got home from work, it was back to normal, around 160. I was 17+2. That was the last time I heard his heartbeat. On Thursday morning, I used the doppler right after I woke up for about 15 minutes and got nothing. I knew I had an anterior placenta so I tried not to jump to conclusions. I got up and ate breakfast and tried again before leaving for work but still couldn’t find it. I told my husband and shoved the doppler in my purse so I could check again at lunch time. My break came and I tried again. Still nothing. At first, I debated about calling my OB right away because I had just been seen three days ago and I was really just hoping that the baby had changed positions and that I would find the heartbeat later. I had been frequenting r/pregnancyafterloss this time around so I posted over there about the situation. Several people assured me it would be okay to call and that if I waited, my anxiety would just get worse. I called and they scheduled me for an ultrasound at 2:30pm.

I tried to remain optimistic on the drive to the Dr’s office but kept thinking the worst. I flipped back and forth, telling myself that the odds of having another loss were low. On the other hand, I had been on the wrong side of statistics before, so they didn’t mean much anymore. Once I got called back to the ultrasound room, the first thing I saw on the screen was the technician measuring the baby’s head. I didn’t see any movement. She then looked at his abdomen. I still didn’t see any movement. Then a flat line appeared at the bottom of the screen. I recognized this from the ultrasound where we found out we lost Ezra. The line should have showed his heartbeat. I knew right then that he was gone. She quickly switched back to the abdomen. There was no flicker of a heartbeat and still no movement. The technician let out a small sigh and then stood up. She told me I could sit up and that she was going to get my doctor. My heart was pounding while tears filled my eyes. I was in total shock that this was happening again. 

We were taken to an exam room. My husband and I waited silently and just cried while we waited for my OB to see us. She was very sympathetic and told us she didn’t see this coming. She remembered that I had wanted to do more testing last time but wasn’t able to. She said she would order blood work to test for any infections. She also told us that she had already been in contact with my MFM and that she would be able to do an amniocentesis that afternoon. After that was done, we decided we would go straight to labor and delivery for an induction. I just wanted to get the delivery over with as soon as possible and then be able to go home and grieve.

I was slightly anxious about the amnio because I wasn’t prepared for it and didn’t know what to expect. At the same time I was still feeling numb and I knew I would do just about anything to have a chance at getting some answers this time. It ended up being pretty tolerable. I felt some burning and pain for a few seconds when the needle was inserted, followed by some strong cramps for a few seconds but that was it. After the procedure was done, a nurse drew some blood for additional testing. Thinking back, I don’t remember what exactly that was for so I’ll have to ask (the blood work for the infection testing was drawn later in the hospital). Next, we spoke with the MFM for a few minutes. She informed me that for my next pregnancy, she and my OB agreed they would put me on Lovenox and that I would have weekly OB appointments until 24 weeks.

It was somewhere around 5:00pm when we got to labor and delivery. I wasn’t nearly as anxious this time since I knew what to expect. I knew what the induction process would be like physically and emotionally and I just wasn’t scared this time. I knew it would be a difficult experience but it something that I just had to get through. I had done it once before and I knew I could find the strength to do it again. My husband left to go home and get clothes and things for us as well as to get things for our LC who was going to stay with my brother and sister-in-law. 

I wanted to make sure I didn’t fail to ask about any testing or ask any other questions before it was too late this time. I posted again in the PAL sub and got some ideas for questions. Someone asked why they did an amnio versus testing after delivery. I asked a nurse about it and she said it really just came down to cost. My insurance could be billed for the amnio but because the hospital I was at does not do fetal autopsies, they have to send it to another hospital and it would be very expensive. She seemed very knowledgeable so I also told her about what happened with the baby’s heart rate earlier in the week. She said she would ask my MFM about it and get some more details about the cost of autopsy. She came back a while later and read back text messages between her and my MFM. She confirmed that the autopsy would be $5000 out of pocket and only had a 50% chance of giving us any answers. She told us she worked at the other hospital as well and if you’re a patient there, autopsies are done automatically at no charge, which was so frustrating to hear. While the nurse continued to read back the messages, she read parts of them saying that we were such a nice couple and how they both felt so bad for us that this was happening again. Thinking about it later, it almost made me cry that she and the doctors really care so much and I felt like they all went above and beyond.

I was given the first dose of misoprostol vaginally at 7:50pm and my husband got back about an hour later. I started getting a little crampy but couldn’t tell if it was the medicine or if it was due to the amnio at that point. For the next few hours, we just tried to pass time as best we could. We went back and forth between watching TV and talking/crying/being angry and being totally surprised yet not surprised, all at the same time. During this time, we also decided to go with our top choice of name so far, which was Levi. I got the second dose of miso around midnight.  I finally dozed some off an on between 2:00 and 3:00am. Around then, the cramps started coming on stronger. Around 3:30am, I was getting pretty uncomfortable. 

When I was induced with Ezra, I got the first dose of medicine at about 9:00pm and took an Ambien a few hours later when I couldn’t sleep. I slept off an on most of the night and woke up sometime around 6:00am feeling cramps (contractions really, I suppose) coming in waves. I was very groggy so I don’t remember how long it had been going on. I asked for pain medicine at that point because then, I was thinking that everything was just ramping up and that I still had a long way to go. I was given Stadol and then delivered right after that, at 6:15am. I was so out of it and barely awake that I couldn’t remember a lot of what happened. The nurse didn’t warn me that the pain medicine would also make me sleepy. My husband later told me about things that happened that I had no recollection of.

I wanted to be fully aware of what was going on so that I didn’t miss anything this time, so when the nurse offered earlier in the evening, I declined taking anything to help me sleep. This time around the nurses and the OB working that night both warned me that typically, women in my situation don’t have much going on and then suddenly the pain gets worse out of nowhere and everything happens pretty quickly, usually within 9 to 12 hours of the first dose of miso. That was consistent with what I experienced the first time with Ezra but I didn’t get that warning with him. I just thought that it would be a long, slow and gradual process and wasn’t told otherwise. 

With the pain getting worse, I called the nurse to ask about something for pain that wouldn’t make me sleepy. I had a feeling that it wouldn’t be much longer since I recognized the waves of pain like last time but I wasn’t really sure since my perception of time was skewed before. The nurse went over some medication options that were milder and turned to leave when I suddenly felt something leaking from my vagina. I told her about it and as she reached for some gloves, I then felt pressure as well. She checked and told me that she could see the sac and that I was about to deliver. With a small push, Levi was born, still encased in the amniotic sac. Another small push a few minutes later and the placenta was out, all in one piece. The nurses informed me earlier in the evening that sometimes this early in a pregnancy, the placenta does not fully detach so a D&C may be required. Luckily, I was able to avoid that once again.

A minute or two after the placenta came, the OB came in and let me know she was going to take the baby so she could examine him and check for any obvious problems. She left and the nurses began to clean me up and one of them gave me some pitocin via IV to help limit my bleeding. A little while later, the OB came back in. She said “I think I have some answers for you.” I’ll never forget hearing her say that because it was so unexpected but also so, so relieving to hear after not knowing why we lost Ezra. She explained that the umbilical cord was wrapped twice around his neck very tightly. She said that usually nuchal cords are harmless for babies and usually aren't discovered until labor starts and the baby’s heart rate drops, however it can cause problems in rare cases. She said she was 99% sure that this was what caused his death. A little while later, she came back in and told us that one of the nurses actually noticed that the cord seemed a little short after breaking the sac. She looked closely and actually found that the cord was wrapped around three times.

When Ezra was born last year, I couldn’t bring myself to hold him. I went over to the bassinet and unwrapped him and looked at him. I talked to him and told him goodbye before we left but I just couldn’t pick him up. Without going into too much detail,  it was obvious by his physical appearance that we had lost him quite some time ago. Because of this I was afraid to move him because I was afraid I’d somehow damage him. I was also afraid that picking him up and feeling how light he was would just be too hard. Looking back, I regretted not holding him and in a way, felt like a bad mother for not doing so.

Later in the morning, a nurse asked if I wanted to see Levi and I said yes. I knew I wanted to hold him so I wouldn’t regret it again. As morbid as it is, I knew Levi’s physical condition should be much easier to stomach since he had just passed a day and a half ago at most. A few minutes later, she returned and wheeled in a bassinet. He was wrapped up in a tiny blanket and was wearing a tiny white hat, with a teal colored pom pom on it. I lifted him out of the bassinet and he fit easily in the palms of both of my hands. He was so tiny and so perfect looking. His hands were no bigger than my fingertips but they were formed perfectly with so much detail despite their small size. I took some photos of him. This was also something i couldn’t bring myself to do with Ezra. Luckily, the hospital provided us with photos of him in the memory box they gave us but I still regretted not taking my own. It was so hard realizing that there will never be any new photos of your child and that the only ones you have were taken by strangers.

The nurses came back a while later to ask about the arrangements for his remains. A local funeral home offers cremation at no charge for bereaved parents so we went with that option again, like we did with Ezra. I cried when I filled out Levi’s name on the paperwork. It stung to write out his name for the first time on paperwork for the funeral home instead of paperwork for his birth certificate.

I was discharged from the hospital around lunch time. Once again, it was so difficult to walk, empty handed, down the hallway that felt a hundred miles long, past rooms where other were women delivering their living babies, and out to the waiting room passing families eagerly awaiting good news. There was no one waiting for us and there was no good news.

The physical experience has been largely the same with both losses. The induction process overall was again relatively quick and uncomfortable at worst, each time. My milk has come in both times which just adds insult to injury but the engorgement hasn’t been as bad and has been less painful this time for some reason. The emotional experience however, has been different this time around. The loss still stings just as much as before but it’s almost like I’m more familiar with the emotions this time so I can process them a little faster. I also knew what kind of things would be triggers so I was better prepared to handle them. I’m waiting to talk to my OB at my follow up appointment (which of course is scheduled for the same morning that my anatomy scan would’ve been) but from what I can gather now, this was just a freak accident. I’m glad to have some answers this time around no matter what and I’m slightly relieved, assuming it’s something not likely to happen again. However, I’m also extremely pissed off about it. What are the odds of some crazy accidental thing causing another loss for us? It feels like we’ve just been hit by lightning twice. 

We never got around to ordering an urn for Ezra so on Sunday, my husband and sat down and picked out two them for each of our boys. We hung up a shelf to place them on in our bedroom. It’s nice to know that they’ll have their own little home inside our house.

I’m going to ask my OB about doing whatever we can for my next pregnancy. I want to throw everything we can at it next time. Even after the first loss, I knew that going forward, a happy, carefree pregnancy would not be possible but that feels even more true now. I know I will be terrified of losing another baby. As soon as I get another positive test, I will immediately wonder if I will get the privilege of bringing home the next baby in a car seat or if I will bring home their ashes in a box. It’s so scary to not know what the future holds, but at this point, I still feel that the pain of regret over not trying again would outweigh the pain of another loss.",t2_156q44,False,,0,False,Levi's Story: Miscarriage at 17 Weeks,[],r/ttcafterloss,False,0,trigger,0,,,False,t3_awaecu,False,dark,1.0,,public,53,0,{},,8b677c92-711f-11e4-b63c-12313b0b807d,False,[],,False,False,,{},Trigger - mention of LC,False,53,,False,self,False,,[],{},,True,,1551506999.0,text,0,,,text,self.ttcafterloss,False,"<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=""md""><p>Levi was born on February 22, 2019 at 3:46am.

My NT scan and and second trimester blood work done at an MFM’s office at 13 weeks were all normal. just like last time. My OB decided to have the MFM do my anatomy scan this time to be cautious. The MFM also had me come in for an additional ultrasound at her office at 15 weeks because she didn’t want me going too long without any check ups since I was near the time frame of my last loss. I started to feel a little more hopeful with this extra oversight.</p>

<p>When I was about 12 weeks, I purchased a home doppler. After I practiced using it a few times, I was always able to find baby’s heartbeat pretty quickly. We knew that Ezra passed sometime between my last OB appointment at 15 weeks and 19 weeks. I had no way of knowing since it was too early for consistent movement and I had no other worrisome symptoms. Being able to listen to this new baby’s heartbeat anytime the anxiety crept up on me was so comforting. </p>

<p>On Monday, February 18, when I was 16+6, I used the doppler that morning and noticed that the baby’s heartbeat sounded faster than normal. The heart rate reading never was accurate from the doppler so I counted it and came up with about 200 bpm. It had always been right around 160 prior to that, according to my doppler and ultrasounds. I called my OB’s nurse line and scheduled an ultrasound for that afternoon. At the ultrasound, the baby’s heartbeat was around 180 and the baby was still measuring on track. My normal OB was out of the office that day but a midwife reviewed the scan and assured us that everything was normal. During the ultrasound, we also found out the baby was a boy!  I was so happy to know the baby’s gender. We didn’t find out with Ezra until after he was born so it helped me feel closer to this baby to find out while he was alive. My husband and I immediately started trying to come up with names because boy names have always been hard for us to come up with.</p>

<p>The excitement was short lived. I continued checking on the baby’s heartbeat at home. On Tuesday it was around 170 bpm. On Wednesday evening after I got home from work, it was back to normal, around 160. I was 17+2. That was the last time I heard his heartbeat. On Thursday morning, I used the doppler right after I woke up for about 15 minutes and got nothing. I knew I had an anterior placenta so I tried not to jump to conclusions. I got up and ate breakfast and tried again before leaving for work but still couldn’t find it. I told my husband and shoved the doppler in my purse so I could check again at lunch time. My break came and I tried again. Still nothing. At first, I debated about calling my OB right away because I had just been seen three days ago and I was really just hoping that the baby had changed positions and that I would find the heartbeat later. I had been frequenting <a href=""/r/pregnancyafterloss"">r/pregnancyafterloss</a> this time around so I posted over there about the situation. Several people assured me it would be okay to call and that if I waited, my anxiety would just get worse. I called and they scheduled me for an ultrasound at 2:30pm.</p>

<p>I tried to remain optimistic on the drive to the Dr’s office but kept thinking the worst. I flipped back and forth, telling myself that the odds of having another loss were low. On the other hand, I had been on the wrong side of statistics before, so they didn’t mean much anymore. Once I got called back to the ultrasound room, the first thing I saw on the screen was the technician measuring the baby’s head. I didn’t see any movement. She then looked at his abdomen. I still didn’t see any movement. Then a flat line appeared at the bottom of the screen. I recognized this from the ultrasound where we found out we lost Ezra. The line should have showed his heartbeat. I knew right then that he was gone. She quickly switched back to the abdomen. There was no flicker of a heartbeat and still no movement. The technician let out a small sigh and then stood up. She told me I could sit up and that she was going to get my doctor. My heart was pounding while tears filled my eyes. I was in total shock that this was happening again. </p>

<p>We were taken to an exam room. My husband and I waited silently and just cried while we waited for my OB to see us. She was very sympathetic and told us she didn’t see this coming. She remembered that I had wanted to do more testing last time but wasn’t able to. She said she would order blood work to test for any infections. She also told us that she had already been in contact with my MFM and that she would be able to do an amniocentesis that afternoon. After that was done, we decided we would go straight to labor and delivery for an induction. I just wanted to get the delivery over with as soon as possible and then be able to go home and grieve.</p>

<p>I was slightly anxious about the amnio because I wasn’t prepared for it and didn’t know what to expect. At the same time I was still feeling numb and I knew I would do just about anything to have a chance at getting some answers this time. It ended up being pretty tolerable. I felt some burning and pain for a few seconds when the needle was inserted, followed by some strong cramps for a few seconds but that was it. After the procedure was done, a nurse drew some blood for additional testing. Thinking back, I don’t remember what exactly that was for so I’ll have to ask (the blood work for the infection testing was drawn later in the hospital). Next, we spoke with the MFM for a few minutes. She informed me that for my next pregnancy, she and my OB agreed they would put me on Lovenox and that I would have weekly OB appointments until 24 weeks.</p>

<p>It was somewhere around 5:00pm when we got to labor and delivery. I wasn’t nearly as anxious this time since I knew what to expect. I knew what the induction process would be like physically and emotionally and I just wasn’t scared this time. I knew it would be a difficult experience but it something that I just had to get through. I had done it once before and I knew I could find the strength to do it again. My husband left to go home and get clothes and things for us as well as to get things for our LC who was going to stay with my brother and sister-in-law. </p>

<p>I wanted to make sure I didn’t fail to ask about any testing or ask any other questions before it was too late this time. I posted again in the PAL sub and got some ideas for questions. Someone asked why they did an amnio versus testing after delivery. I asked a nurse about it and she said it really just came down to cost. My insurance could be billed for the amnio but because the hospital I was at does not do fetal autopsies, they have to send it to another hospital and it would be very expensive. She seemed very knowledgeable so I also told her about what happened with the baby’s heart rate earlier in the week. She said she would ask my MFM about it and get some more details about the cost of autopsy. She came back a while later and read back text messages between her and my MFM. She confirmed that the autopsy would be $5000 out of pocket and only had a 50% chance of giving us any answers. She told us she worked at the other hospital as well and if you’re a patient there, autopsies are done automatically at no charge, which was so frustrating to hear. While the nurse continued to read back the messages, she read parts of them saying that we were such a nice couple and how they both felt so bad for us that this was happening again. Thinking about it later, it almost made me cry that she and the doctors really care so much and I felt like they all went above and beyond.</p>

<p>I was given the first dose of misoprostol vaginally at 7:50pm and my husband got back about an hour later. I started getting a little crampy but couldn’t tell if it was the medicine or if it was due to the amnio at that point. For the next few hours, we just tried to pass time as best we could. We went back and forth between watching TV and talking/crying/being angry and being totally surprised yet not surprised, all at the same time. During this time, we also decided to go with our top choice of name so far, which was Levi. I got the second dose of miso around midnight.  I finally dozed some off an on between 2:00 and 3:00am. Around then, the cramps started coming on stronger. Around 3:30am, I was getting pretty uncomfortable. </p>

<p>When I was induced with Ezra, I got the first dose of medicine at about 9:00pm and took an Ambien a few hours later when I couldn’t sleep. I slept off an on most of the night and woke up sometime around 6:00am feeling cramps (contractions really, I suppose) coming in waves. I was very groggy so I don’t remember how long it had been going on. I asked for pain medicine at that point because then, I was thinking that everything was just ramping up and that I still had a long way to go. I was given Stadol and then delivered right after that, at 6:15am. I was so out of it and barely awake that I couldn’t remember a lot of what happened. The nurse didn’t warn me that the pain medicine would also make me sleepy. My husband later told me about things that happened that I had no recollection of.</p>

<p>I wanted to be fully aware of what was going on so that I didn’t miss anything this time, so when the nurse offered earlier in the evening, I declined taking anything to help me sleep. This time around the nurses and the OB working that night both warned me that typically, women in my situation don’t have much going on and then suddenly the pain gets worse out of nowhere and everything happens pretty quickly, usually within 9 to 12 hours of the first dose of miso. That was consistent with what I experienced the first time with Ezra but I didn’t get that warning with him. I just thought that it would be a long, slow and gradual process and wasn’t told otherwise. </p>

<p>With the pain getting worse, I called the nurse to ask about something for pain that wouldn’t make me sleepy. I had a feeling that it wouldn’t be much longer since I recognized the waves of pain like last time but I wasn’t really sure since my perception of time was skewed before. The nurse went over some medication options that were milder and turned to leave when I suddenly felt something leaking from my vagina. I told her about it and as she reached for some gloves, I then felt pressure as well. She checked and told me that she could see the sac and that I was about to deliver. With a small push, Levi was born, still encased in the amniotic sac. Another small push a few minutes later and the placenta was out, all in one piece. The nurses informed me earlier in the evening that sometimes this early in a pregnancy, the placenta does not fully detach so a D&amp;C may be required. Luckily, I was able to avoid that once again.</p>

<p>A minute or two after the placenta came, the OB came in and let me know she was going to take the baby so she could examine him and check for any obvious problems. She left and the nurses began to clean me up and one of them gave me some pitocin via IV to help limit my bleeding. A little while later, the OB came back in. She said “I think I have some answers for you.” I’ll never forget hearing her say that because it was so unexpected but also so, so relieving to hear after not knowing why we lost Ezra. She explained that the umbilical cord was wrapped twice around his neck very tightly. She said that usually nuchal cords are harmless for babies and usually aren&#39;t discovered until labor starts and the baby’s heart rate drops, however it can cause problems in rare cases. She said she was 99% sure that this was what caused his death. A little while later, she came back in and told us that one of the nurses actually noticed that the cord seemed a little short after breaking the sac. She looked closely and actually found that the cord was wrapped around three times.</p>

<p>When Ezra was born last year, I couldn’t bring myself to hold him. I went over to the bassinet and unwrapped him and looked at him. I talked to him and told him goodbye before we left but I just couldn’t pick him up. Without going into too much detail,  it was obvious by his physical appearance that we had lost him quite some time ago. Because of this I was afraid to move him because I was afraid I’d somehow damage him. I was also afraid that picking him up and feeling how light he was would just be too hard. Looking back, I regretted not holding him and in a way, felt like a bad mother for not doing so.</p>

<p>Later in the morning, a nurse asked if I wanted to see Levi and I said yes. I knew I wanted to hold him so I wouldn’t regret it again. As morbid as it is, I knew Levi’s physical condition should be much easier to stomach since he had just passed a day and a half ago at most. A few minutes later, she returned and wheeled in a bassinet. He was wrapped up in a tiny blanket and was wearing a tiny white hat, with a teal colored pom pom on it. I lifted him out of the bassinet and he fit easily in the palms of both of my hands. He was so tiny and so perfect looking. His hands were no bigger than my fingertips but they were formed perfectly with so much detail despite their small size. I took some photos of him. This was also something i couldn’t bring myself to do with Ezra. Luckily, the hospital provided us with photos of him in the memory box they gave us but I still regretted not taking my own. It was so hard realizing that there will never be any new photos of your child and that the only ones you have were taken by strangers.</p>

<p>The nurses came back a while later to ask about the arrangements for his remains. A local funeral home offers cremation at no charge for bereaved parents so we went with that option again, like we did with Ezra. I cried when I filled out Levi’s name on the paperwork. It stung to write out his name for the first time on paperwork for the funeral home instead of paperwork for his birth certificate.</p>

<p>I was discharged from the hospital around lunch time. Once again, it was so difficult to walk, empty handed, down the hallway that felt a hundred miles long, past rooms where other were women delivering their living babies, and out to the waiting room passing families eagerly awaiting good news. There was no one waiting for us and there was no good news.</p>

<p>The physical experience has been largely the same with both losses. The induction process overall was again relatively quick and uncomfortable at worst, each time. My milk has come in both times which just adds insult to injury but the engorgement hasn’t been as bad and has been less painful this time for some reason. The emotional experience however, has been different this time around. The loss still stings just as much as before but it’s almost like I’m more familiar with the emotions this time so I can process them a little faster. I also knew what kind of things would be triggers so I was better prepared to handle them. I’m waiting to talk to my OB at my follow up appointment (which of course is scheduled for the same morning that my anatomy scan would’ve been) but from what I can gather now, this was just a freak accident. I’m glad to have some answers this time around no matter what and I’m slightly relieved, assuming it’s something not likely to happen again. However, I’m also extremely pissed off about it. What are the odds of some crazy accidental thing causing another loss for us? It feels like we’ve just been hit by lightning twice. </p>

<p>We never got around to ordering an urn for Ezra so on Sunday, my husband and sat down and picked out two them for each of our boys. We hung up a shelf to place them on in our bedroom. It’s nice to know that they’ll have their own little home inside our house.</p>

<p>I’m going to ask my OB about doing whatever we can for my next pregnancy. I want to throw everything we can at it next time. Even after the first loss, I knew that going forward, a happy, carefree pregnancy would not be possible but that feels even more true now. I know I will be terrified of losing another baby. As soon as I get another positive test, I will immediately wonder if I will get the privilege of bringing home the next baby in a car seat or if I will bring home their ashes in a box. It’s so scary to not know what the future holds, but at this point, I still feel that the pain of regret over not trying again would outweigh the pain of another loss.</p>

6,2048,confidence,<praw.reddit.Reddit object at 0x7f12a630cd90>,,ttcafterloss,"Hi,

I've been a lurker for a few months now. This seems like a supportive group, and I'm in need of some support lately so I thought I'd write. We went through 2 rounds of IVF two years ago and ended up with four chromosomally normal embryos. We implanted one last January. Pregnancy was really hard for me. I was extremely nauseous the entire time and my swelling and weight gain were out of control starting at 25 weeks. I kept complaining about the swelling and weight gain at all of my appointments, but they kept insisting that the swelling was normal and that I should watch my carbs to control the weight gain. Around 30 weeks, I called because I had gained 8 pounds in one week, and I was having trouble breathing. They sent me to L&D and all was well. Around 34 weeks, my perinatal psychiatrist at the same hospital found that my blood pressure was elevated to 143/89 so she insisted I call my OB. The OB sent me back to L&D and, again, everything looked normal. They had me go for one extra blood pressure check 3 days later which was normal. I had another routine OB appointment one week after the blood pressure check and everything looked normal again. I was at work 4 days later, and I started feeling nauseous in the afternoon. But I'd been nauseous off and on my entire pregnancy. By the time I got home from work, I started having severe cramping. I ran into the bathroom and threw up multiple times. I was in extreme pain. My husband rushed me back to L&D, and we were told that our baby no longer had a heartbeat. To make things worse, my blood pressure was 190/110, my platelets were down and my hemoglobin was down. I was in labor and dilated to a 4. They couldn't give me an epidural because my platelets were so low. After 7 hours of labor, I delivered my stillborn son. Things were very touch and go with me. I was bleeding so much I needed 2 blood transfusions. 

My husband and I spent 3 days with our son, and we then had to leave him at the hospital. It was the hardest thing we've every done. We actually walked home to our apartment which was only 3 blocks away. This started on a Tuesday night, and we did not hear from my primary OB until the following Monday morning. She called me that morning and started with ""so I heard you had a rough week.""  Seriously. And when I checked in for a follow-up appointment at the OB that week, their receptionist actually said to me ""congratulations on the baby!""  I changed OBs in the practice to the one who was on call and delivered me. 

The months since I delivered have been the darkest, most difficult months of my life. I've been angry, depressed and mad at just about everyone who hasn't suffered a loss. But up until this week, it seemed like I was slowly doing better. This week has been brutal, and I don't know why. We went to our first Share meeting this week so maybe that triggered something? And we're talking about implanting another embryo at the end of the month so I don't know whether that's bringing up lots of feelings. Has anyone else experienced this type of setback months after their loss? My grief has ebbed and flowed the last few months, but never anything this dramatic. I just feel like I'll never be okay again. I'm seeing two therapists, and I'm doing everything I can to get better. But it still seems impossible to move forward.

Also, has anyone else had a successful pregnancy after an abruption? We consulted an MFM and he said the abruption was due to severe preeclampsia. He said he was confident this wouldn't happen again. But, of course, once it happens to you, you think it will happen again. Once you've been the 0.5%, statistics seem meaningless. 

I'm sorry to vent. I'm just really struggling, and could use some reassurance, advice, support or any words of wisdom you have to offer.

Hi everyone. I'm feeling a little silly posting this but the anxiety is creeping up and needing a helpful portal. 

SO and I had an early term MC back in October (long story short). My body is FINALLY getting back on track to a somewhat 'normal' cycle and we have decided to start TTC again at the end of April. I just started tracking again this month and all that fun stuff....however I have this undying fear that the next pregnancy will also end in the same manner. (My hands are so sweaty right now thinking about it). 

I feel so silly over it all. And I know you can't predict the future or anything but I'm afraid now that I won't let go of this insane anxiety until the future baby is out and safe in my arms. The more I think about it, the more I start to worry and panic. And I've been doing so good mentally this year. It doesn't creep into my thoughts nearly as often as it used to.. Perhaps triggered from the upcoming births from our friends and family? I'm not really sure..

I'm trying to keep a open mind of course IF another loss happens again (poor choice of words here). Has anyone else felt like this/been through this?

The more I think about it, the more I start to worry and panic. And I&#39;ve been doing so good mentally this year. It doesn&#39;t creep into my thoughts nearly as often as it used to.. Perhaps triggered from the upcoming births from our friends and family? I&#39;m not really sure..</p>

<p>I&#39;m trying to keep a open mind of course IF another loss happens again (poor choice of words here). Has anyone else felt like this/been through this? TIA</p>

They almost didnt let me take him home for a proper burial, but instead tried to dispose of him like trash at the hospital. I was so scared and upset after an extremely painful, terrifying, unmedicated labor (which they fucking induced) And the nurse also told me ""Stop screaming its not that bad."" 

He was alive when I got to the hospital. Perfect strong heartbeat, but because my mucus plug broke they induced me. After the birth and my mom screaming at the Dr ""Hes not a piece of trash to throw away hes my daughters son/my grandson!"" When they asked to dispose of him, They left us alone with him for 6 hours, being forced to hear the babies heartbeats in the rooms adjoining my own. It broke me. They wouldnt move my room or let me just go home until the Dr was done with her C-sections. She offered us ""Free genetic testing"" Which my husband, mom and I all refused as it involved mutilating my sons body to get what they needed. We said NO. But when the funeral home came to pick my baby up, That bitch did it anyway. She cut a chunk out of his back, as If I wouldnt notice. Didnt bother telling us she did it til after she had already. She also did not bother to check me before my release, so ive been bleeding and in severe pain for the last 20 days.

I have been treated like absolute SHIT since this happened. My MIL made it all about her. She got me harassed and threatened by my husbands ex and exs mother. I was told my baby never existed and that I was a liar. That my baby died because my husband went NC with his ex and his other kid cuz of ex being a straight cunt. That my baby died because Husband didnt deserve another child. That It was my fault and I deserved it for breaking up ""Their family"" which is a crock cuz hes been broken up with her since his son was 1, so almost 8 years. Ive been living in HELL cuz of these people.

The funeral was alright. A few of our friends showed up, MIL, FIL and my moms best friend. Husband and I ended up walking out of the service cuz of how loud mil was blubbering and loudly crying out how much SHE loved him...It pissed us off at how she even ruined his service, let alone ruining our mourning process with her fucking fb bullshit and stealing my photos of him to repost for her friends including DHs ex/exs mom, who i told her I want them to know NOTHING of our lives, as if she would fucking listen.

Its been 20 days. Still bleeding. Still in pain. That ""Free genetic testing"" was a bullshit lie for the Dr to get a HUGE payday cuz that bitch TRIED to bill my insurance. I caught it and forced them to do a stop payment after explaining what happened, and then i called and laid into the dr herself. She murdered my son by refusing to help me during labor because her C-sections were more important. Had she fucking helped me when he got stuck he mightve had a fucking chance. She didnt even care because of how young he was she wasnt even gonna try. She let him die and for that I will never forgive her or trust that hospital ever again. She didnt even properly get everything and left very large painful to pass pieces of placenta in me, that we didnt know about til i was home, screaming in pain like labor pains, trying to pass them.

My sons ashes are with me now, in a tiny heart necklace and a small gold heart urn that I keep close by me. Idk why but I need to have them by me at all times when im home. I have them on the bed with us during the day, next to my pillow at night, and I never take off the necklace since I got it. I know its weird, but its all ive got left of my baby... Idk how to deal with this. I cry every day. Im in pain every day. I cant see or hear babies or I cry. Im scared to try again because this is the 2nd. I have no living kids. My first was so early i didnt even know. But this one..I was already half way through..There was no reason for this. I feel like I failed. I failed my husband. I failed myself. But most of all I failed my son...I failed the one person who couldnt defend themselves without me and I failed him and I dont even know how or why...

I see all my friends post their pregnancies, their babies, their kids...And I hate them. I hate that they can have kids and I lost mine. I hate that some of them literally only had their kids to keep their man and treat that kid like shit cuz the man left. Or they lost their kids to CPS for doing drugs and then get pregnant to replace them. Id treat my child like GOLD and I cant even get that chance, but these people can keep abusing their kids and just pop out more like nothing, And I Fucking HATE them. Im angry, Im broken and Im tired of all of this...When is it gonna be my turn to be happy?

Today is February 28th. This time last year, I miscarried. A little over a month later, my sister called me to tell me she's pregnant - as the words left her mouth, my period started for the first time since my loss, so it felt like a double punch in the gut. She gave birth to my beautiful baby niece this past December, and while I'm over the moon for her and love my niece so so SO much, it was bittersweet for me, because as happy as I was for her, I kept thinking ""I should have a 3 month old by now"" and it just hurt.

It's been a year already, and I can't believe it. Time flew so fast, even though it feels like I miscarried yesterday. I've been struggling emotionally on and off for a long time now (as I'm sure many can relate - there are good days and there are bad days) and my sister mentioned how sometimes when she's stressed she'll walk into church, light a candle, sit for a little and then leave, and she feels better.

Now, I want to preface by saying we're not super religious. We're Christian, but we don't attend church on a regular (mostly just weddings, baby related things, funerals, etc). But since she said it was peaceful and made her feel better, I figured I'd give it a shot today because I feel like crap and couldn't stop crying - I thought it would be cathartic to acknowledge my loss in some physical way (lighting a candle) and give myself some much needed closure. Hubby agreed, and used his lunch break to come with me. We lit some candles and went and sat for a little.

Now when you go into the church in the middle of the day, typically there's no one there, there's music playing, and the stain glass windows are lit. This past year has been very frustrating (a lot has happened) and I keep telling my husband that God keeps messing with us and ""I don't think he's listening to me"" is something I say very often.

Then today, when we were sitting, I was crying a little bit and we just sat quietly while I started to say a quick prayer in my head. Just as I started, the lights went off and the music stopped.

I started crying harder and laughed in disbelief, and said, ""That's poetic. I keep complaining that God won't listen and now he's literally shutting me out.""

And then my husband, my brilliant, brilliant husband, goes, ""See. That's the difference between us. You see this as him shutting you out and I see it as the opposite. He turned everything down to hear you better.""

I started laugh crying and told him I hate it when he's right.

I know that I can sometimes focus on the negative, but my husband's comment was so jarring to me, it completely shifted my perspective and gave me a lot to think about. I genuinely feel a little better now.

I can't lie to myself - I don't think I will be 100% until I conceive again. But for once I finally feel hopeful again.

I also came across this study, which seems to indicate that TOO MUCH progesterone can interfere with implantation. I can’t be sure, but I have a strong suspicion this may have been a factor in my experience—especially since there was no evidence my progesterone was ever “low” in the first place:

Hi, all

Long-time lurker, first-time poster here. I’m sorry for what everyone has been through but also very impressed by all the strength, love, and support in this sub.

I just want to vent and see if anyone has had a similar experience:

Pregnancy 1, blighted ovum miscarriage at ~8weeks

Pregnancy 2, spontaneous abort!on (miscarriage) at ~5.5 weeks

Pregnancy 3, missed miscarriage at 6 weeks, D&C

Since these 3 losses, I’ve been treated for subclinical hypothyroidism, and I switched to methylated folate and started taking baby aspirin for an MTHFR mutation. Definitely feeling a difference; it seems like my body should be better equipped than ever to handle a pregnancy.

However, since I’ve been “better,” I haven’t managed to get pregnant again. I’m now in my third cycle of no bfp, which is really frustrating because before, I got pregnant every time we tried. The only other thing that’s been different is that I’ve been taking supplemental progesterone starting 3 dpo, per my repro endo’s instruction. I’ve wondered if that could somehow be to blame, but I’ve heard/read that there’s pretty much no known downside to extra progesterone unless you start it too early (and I’ve been using opks, so I’m pretty sure that’s not the case.)

Husband says be patient; we’re still within the statistical norm of 1 in 5 attempts being successful...but I’m worried that there is a new problem, and/or that we still haven’t solved the original problem and have yet to find that out. I guess the only thing to do is keep trying...Anything else I should test, research, or try in the meantime? Thanks, all.

TLDR 3 consecutive pregnancies ended in miscarriage; now I’m supposedly “better” but can’t seem to get pregnant again.

A week ago I was pregnant, then last Thursday I had extreme bleeding which I was sure was a miscarriage. It wasnt, we had hope, it was just a subchoronic hemorrhage. Then we found out the pregnancy, though in the uterus, might be etopic because it was in the far left corner. Blood work was done on Friday and looked good.

They called me in on Monday for more bloodwork and another ultrasound. They said either I needed a D&C or an MRI (if things were progressing fine)


I had to wait until 8pm that night to learn the results because their lab was backed up even though I was a STAT order that went in at 8am. The doctor called me and said dont go to the MRI. You need to come in for surgery.Sac didnt move. And the blood results stayed the same, this is not a viable pregnancy and is likely etopic. 

We are told we would get a call at 730 about what time to come in, we are dressed and ready at 730. No one calls until 830. On the way, the MRI lab calls yelling that we missed my MRI (doctor said not to go, not to call, they would take care of it). I explain this and get TWO more calls about the MRI throughout the day claiming I missed my appointment and I should have canceled.

When we arrive at the hospital we are told that if they do the D&C and there is pregnancy tissue in the sample, it was not ectopic. If we do the test and no pregnancy tissue, I will need a shot and more testing

I see the doctor after 4 hours, telling me it will be a few more hours. No food, no water. She tells me I will be getting motrin after the surgery and vicodin for extreme cramps if I need it. After five and a half hours I go in. The doctor comes by when I am completely unconscious and tells my husband there is pregnancy tissue in the sample, no shot needed.

We go back to our room, the nurse gives me all this paperwork on an ectopic pregnancy, I ask her because there was pregnancy tissue in the sample isnt it not ectopic? She says she has no idea. She also tells me that I am getting motrin, and when I explain the doctor said I would be getting something stronger in case of extreme cramping she looked at me like junkie. She said she would call the doctor, but um no I shouldn't be getting narcotics for cramps. We wait another half an hour (its 6pm now. Still no food) and we decide to to home. Please call us when you talk to the doctor. No phone call. They call in the motrin to the wrong pharmacy on the other side of town. 

It is currently the next morning, I am not pregnant, and I am so sad. I just wanted a little bit of consistency and someone paying attention. No one really cared and it was brutal.

How are you?
I joined just for this Reddit... I’ve read many posts and I feel like this is the place I belong.
I hope you can help me, you all seem so helpful and supportive!

There’s only so many people I can talk to and my husband already seems over our loss - well he’s not over it but he seems a bit meh when I tell him I’m emotional about it again... so I don’t really want to keep bringing it up to him - so hey guys, warning: I might write a lot... I’ll try keep it short.

Sooo...
I already have a beautiful little boy who is almost 2; my first pregnancy with him was pretty straightforward (except the induced forceps delivery but that’s another story) so I presumed consequent pregnancies would be the same...
We tried for baby 2 last year in November and found out end of January that our 2nd baby had stopped growing at 10 weeks during an emergency scan at 11 weeks, due to bleeding. There was no heartbeat :(
We had already told family, friends and some colleagues because we was so excited and it was devastating for us having to share the bad news to them.
I had an ERPC surgery a few days after finding out as I didn’t want to wait for natural and bled for 2 weeks exactly.

I am still pretty emotional about it... and after speaking to my husband we decided that we want to TTC as soon as possible. 
But... do I need to wait? I’ve read some people said it’s fine and others said you should allow your body to rest? I’m completely conflicted as to what to do as I personally feel in order to get over this loss... I want to be pregnant again.

For personal reasons I would like to have our second baby by the end of this year. And I know I’m not leaving myself much time! 

I recently went back to work and I still feel emotionally vulnerable...

But yeah... I surprisingly started my period again today, exactly 4 weeks after the ERPC surgery and 2 weeks after I stopped bleeding. I wasn’t expecting it so soon?!

My big question is... should I allow myself more time or should I just go for it? I really want to be pregnant so bad but I’m so scared getting pregnant so soon would risk another MC... 

Please help, I’m supposed to wake up in 6 hours but I can’t sleep as I’m in turmoil right now and my hormones are probably not helping! 

TL;DR - should I TTC 4 weeks after ERPC?

Got the all clear from my gyno back in December that everything had passed. Hysterosonogram showed everything looked normal too. I’ve had 3 full cycles on my own since the MMC but have noticed some changes. Has anyone else experienced some or all of these after a miscarriage or MMC?

- Delayed ovulation by a few days some cycles (using Wondfo LH strips to check)
- Increased appetite accompanied by huge amount of bloating and weight gain during the luteal phase (more than usual, wearing pants and bras feels like torture)
- Less menstrual pain and cramping during period (a welcome change!)
- Bleeding for 7 days during my period (normal for me) then one random day of discharge 3 days after the last day of spotting (so CD 10) which contains some fleshy tissue sometimes and dark blood (only when I wipe)
- Acne breakout under my chin after the bleeding stops and also today I just plucked one random 1/2"" long dark hair from under my chin (where did that come from?)

My body feels like a different place now that I’ve been pregnant and had this type of loss. Do things ever go back to normal or is this the new normal?

Well.. maybe I'm just ashamed to admit I haven't wanted to suffer the pain of talking about the pain anymore. My second loss happened last June, I was just at 25 weeks, I was further along than my first loss by a month, and I had to have an emergency c-section to deliver after her little heart stopped. Wow just writing that brings the tears and some small healing from just typing the factual truth. 

I guess I just really want to write that I'm feeling ashamed that I still live in reaction to my loss last year. I've been on edge lately, dealing with some guilt and shame  about all my reactionary behaviors and the underlying constant feelings of loss that still exist and poison so many interactions in my daily life. I feel so lost and confused when I switch from ""it's ok to feel this way"" to ""I shouldn't be feeling this way, I should be better at dealing with this"". 

I STILL cant deal with this reality of failure and loss. I waited 3 years to try again, I had doctors and love and support, I have my autoimmune issues as in-remission as possible. We had the money saved, we tried to be prepared. I'm still just sad and pissed off and HATE that acceptance is my only path to peace. I don't want to accept that I did my best and still got some anomaly nonsense bad deal. 

I stopped going to therapy after a few months, and I'm ready to go back. I'm tired of searching for surface and BS ways to feel better (shopping, talking to ex boyfriends, getting abs for the first time in my life, traveling). Maybe just some therapy time every other week talking it out will bring me back on track to being mentally less miserable. It is a miserable life to avoid my friends with babies, avoid conversations about babies, resent women who complain about their healthy happy offspring. There's so much avoidance and pain in that, but it brings me so much despair to see kids and babies and families sometimes I feel just pain and panic. I know I'm not alone in these feelings, and that brings me some comfort, but I hate it for all of us, not just for myself. How many women have written ""it's not fair"".. just breaks my heart. 

Feels like I should include some positive, I've put in the work at the gym, managed my nutrition and medication for my lupus, and the doctors feel I can try again anytime. My Goal is to try after my 30th bday in April, will be just before the one year loss anniversary mark, I'm not waiting 3 years again. Will be signing myself up for another c-section if I get pregnant again but I just want to do a good job and finally feel a live loving baby in my arms, thats worth a second c-section. The recovery from a c-section without a baby to take home was worse than I would wish on ANYbody but I'm willing.. I am and that feels important to share.

After 2 years of ttc we found out we were pregnant this past October. I was the happiest I’ve ever been pregnant. My whole life the only thing I ever knew I wanted to be was a mom. I lost my son last Friday at 21 weeks. After receiving a horrible prognosis of multiple medical anomalies during our anatomy scan, my husband and I made the painful decision to terminate. There is hole in my heart and an ache without him. His kicks were so frequent at the end. I felt like a murderer at times knowing he was so alive inside of me and that I was ending his life. Luckily I’ve been able to turn it around and know that I’ve made a compassionate choice. The chances of him surviving were very low. I just really miss my baby boy. I’m not religious but picturing him in heaven with my family helps me find comfort and peace. 

I’m really grateful for amazing family, friends and coworkers. A community of people that are carrying me through this time. I just wish I could feel more connected to my husband. He’s shuts down and prefers not to talk about it. I need to talk about it. I know this is so so common. Just wondering what others found helpful in the grieving process with their husbands? What can I do? When I ask him what he needs, he doesn’t respond. I don’t think he even knows. We’re waiting for our sons ashes. I’m hoping we can discuss a way to honor him and spread them somewhere. 

Medications- I was given a low dose of Ativan by my OB for 2 weeks to help me sleep. I’ve tried going to sleep without it, but I just find nights and mornings to be the hardest. It’s when my son was most active. My OB won’t continue prescribing and I’m running out. Trying to get an appt with a psychiatrist but it’s a long wait. I am also thinking of going on an anti-depressant. I’m nervous bc I eventually want to try again. This isn’t something I can even discuss with my husband right now. Giving that time. Anyway, did anyone else need medications after their loss? What were you prescribed and what are your thoughts on it? My friend thinks lexapro is the best.

I’m really freaking out right now. I had two miscarriages back to back recently. In both instances I passed the tissue naturally after a couple weeks of bleeding. With this most recent miscarriage, I passed the tissue about 3 weeks ago, on February 1. My pregnancy symptoms had lessened a lot before I miscarried and were gone within two days of passing the tissue. 
With both pregnancies the first symptom was breast pain and tenderness. It’s very distinct and I never have breast pain when I’m menstruating or ovulating. We had unprotected sex about two days after I miscarried and since then we’ve used condoms. I wanted to give myself time to heal physically but especially mentally before thinking about getting pregnant again. From what I’ve seen online, you can ovulate as early as two weeks after a miscarriage but it takes an average of a month or so before you ovulate. 
The reason I’m posting this is I’m having breast pain again, the same kind that I felt during the first two pregnancies. I’m worried that I ovulated within a few days of miscarrying and I am pregnant again, but I’m not even sure that’s possible. My hcg was back to normal about a week and a half after miscarrying, so I shouldn’t have any lingering hormones from the past pregnancy making me feel these symptoms. I took a pregnancy test two days ago when the breast pain began and it was negative, but I took it late at night and I know that it’s possible that it was just too early or my urine was diluted from the day. 
I’m just really scared. I don’t want to lose another pregnancy. If it’s not possible to ovulate within days of a miscarriage, I’d like to know for peace of mind. My doctor advised me not to get pregnant right away so my uterus could build back its lining. She said she doesn’t recommend getting pregnant right away, and I’m afraid I’ve put myself in jeopardy of another miscarriage.

I couldn’t handle going back to my OB from trauma induced panic attacks so I didn’t go back on birth control. I also have had issues with birth control and wasn’t sure what I wanted to do. My husband and I have been using condoms in the meantime. 

Last month, there was one time we were not careful. I almost got the day after pill, but I didn’t believe one time could have done it and I was pretty sure I wasn’t ovulating at the time. I got increasingly panicked and took a test just a few days before my missed period. A very faint positive. 

I was a mess. I called my psych (bipolar II) and my OB and only my husband and my boss were told. I wasn’t ready to be pregnant, but I wanted my baby to be okay. I insisted they do a blood test and then a follow up test to ensure my hcg was rising. The first blood test confirmed the pregnancy and the nurse was so reassuring that it seemed it would be okay and scheduled my first appointment for next month. My hcg was only 52, but she assured it’s not how high, just that it’s rising and I was very early. 

My test two days later, last Wednesday, showed my hcg went from 52 to 50 and that I would miscarry anytime. I started bleeding on Sunday, but not a great deal. I had held on hope that I would never bleed and it would be some freak thing. 

Today is Tuesday and should have been my first day back at work since Monday was a holiday, but I felt so much worse today. The bleeding has increased greatly today and I just passed a large clot.

Today I had cramps and bleeding since early this morning; and then this afternoon verified with my OB via ultrasound, that I am indeed having a miscarriage. Based on LMP I was 8w4d when the MC began but the embryo stopped developing at 6w. The process is now proceeding naturally, and I don&#39;t know what to expect really, as I have never even had severe cramps or bad periods in my life. I am nervous about the process but I look forward to attempting to conceive again as soon as my body ovulates again. I will be doing temps and OPKs as soon as my bleeding resolves. </p>

<p>&#x200B;</p>

<p>I am grateful for the support of this community, as I am struggling to be okay with &quot;starting over&quot; again. I really hoped this one would work out.</p>

I've posted here once before, but now I'm really at a loss and I'm not sure where to go from here.

This is somewhat of a vent. I'm just not really sure how to feel.

I love my fh. His support is unwavering, he is just all around an incredible man. We discussed kids almost as soon as we got together two years ago.

Last year, we sat down and had a long talk about everything and had a plan. Once we get married, it's free game. We will pull the goalie and whatever happens happens. 

Well, after a 45 cycle that ended with a bfn, we had kind of gotten excited. At this point I had been off hbc for five or six months. We had another long talk, and he decided that he wanted to go ahead and start trying. Said that there was no difference whether it was now or in the next year, and we both agreed that just in case it took a bit, this was a good plan.

We concieved in cycle 5, but it ended with a loss at 6 weeks at the end of January. 

So it's been a few weeks, and I'm ready to face things head on. Let's get back to trying, at least sort of timing sex around my fw. I decided not to start temping again yet. 

We are laying in bed and once I started noticing ewcm, I asked him if he was ready to move forward. Told him if not, that's fine, but I need to know so that way we can use protection. He kind of.. Idk. He answered my question with a question and we moved away so I didn't get an exact answer. I didn't think much of it. 

Well, we didnt use protection and pretty sure we hit O-3, O-2, and O/O+1 (weird time of day lol).

Well, in a turn of events I realize I'm kind of spiraling downward emotionally. He has been working nights this week, and I work 8-5 so I've hardly seen him at all other than sleeping together for a couple of hours. 

I set an alarm for this morning so I could be awake we he got home so we could talk. I just wanted him to tell me that he loves me and reassure me that everything is okay. I miss my best friend.

So, you still love me right?
-Of course.
You still wanna put up with my shit for the next fifty years?
- *shakes head violently and starts laughing*
You still wanna start a family with me, right?

Fucking hesitation. Within about a half second he shakes his head and smiles.

No. 

So I point out that he hesitated and asked him what was up. 

He tells me that basically he is for sure he wants to some day, but ""if I could wait a few more months, I would"". Apparently he now has changed his mind and wants to travel and live his life stress free with me for a while after we get married since he hasn't been on a real vacation since he was 22. He is 30. 

Of course I understand, but I pointed all of this out in the first place. I told him that I didn't want a baby if he didn't, because this is the rest of our lives. I never wanted him to resent me or our kids because he had big dreams that he never brought to reality.

Part of me thinks it's just part of his grieving process. He was really excited when we found out I was pregnant and I think the whole thing kind of hit him like a freight train when I miscarried. 

Regardless, WHY DIDNT YOU TELL ME YOU WERENT SURE. WHY DID I HAVE TO FUCKING PRY TO GET AN ANSWER ABOUT SOMETHING SO IMPORTANT.

He said he was going to tell me, he just didn't want to upset me or disappoint me and that it's only been a couple days since he started feeling this way.

And now, for the first time ever, I just want to see AF.

It's not that I don't want this. God dammit do I want this. But we have some shit to sort out now and since we keep pushing our wedding back, I'm probably looking at waiting until at least 2020 if this isn't just a phase of grief or something that passes. 

I just don't get it. I mean I do. I want to experience things with him too, and I understand its important to do so. I just don't understand how someone who was so excited about being a dad and starting a family can just change his mind, I guess. This is what I thought I was avoiding when I reiterated so many times that if this isn't what he wants, than neither do I. 

I don't know. I told him kids are forever. So if I had carried to term, what then? 

Either way, this is going to be a long process because I'm going to have a hard time trusting him moving forward. He has to decide when traveling is enough, when he has seen and done enough and I can't decide that for him. If he comes back in two months and says he wants to try again, how do I know he means it??

I mean I thought I was pretty fucking clear the first time but whatever.

We lost our 10W old baby in December and I had my first and mostly normal period last month. I tracked my ovulation and we poured our hearts and souls into timing it right to get pregnant again. Everything seemed great - mostly normal flow during menstruation, my ovulation seemed to come exactly on time for an average cycle and I was so hopeful we'd get lucky. This is what we did when we got pregnant with our first one, I was crossing fingers it would work again.

Took an early pregnancy test a few days ago - negative. I'm 1-2 days from an expected period, so I took one again today. Nothing, a clear negative.

Logically, I know it's normal and okay to not be pregnant right after our loss. My body is still doing it's thing and it just wasn't biologically meant to be.

But I still wanted it to work out. I still anxiously awaited the results both times, and damn if I didn't have a tiny hope my V-Day gift to my husband might be ""you're a dad-to-be!"" Ridiculous as that may sound, the thought still was there.

So I held it together until after the workday where I came home and wept for a bit just to get the frustration, anger and grief out.

It's exhausting to be back on ""how do we get pregnant"" schedule. I am tired of watching and monitoring my cycles like a hawk already ... and we're only one month in. It feels like yesterday I was tracking and timing my body, I wasn't ready to do this all over again.

Everyone seems pregnant. Everyone has babies right now. I'm so conscious of being in my thirties and while there's still decent time for me, I can't help but feel so aware of time passing.

Hi All, 

I thought I had healed emotionally and moved forward. I cheered myself for being able to talk with my super unprofessional coworker who is due in 5 weeks with her third. I handled non-stop baby talks, complaining about potty training and complaining about the cost of kids non-stop. I handled the cone that reserved parking spots for all of the pregnant women, starting the day of my D&C. I've finally come to terms with everything. Then, in the teacher's lounge one of the visiting principals came in, and was visibly pregnant. When asked her due date, it was my date. She bonded with the women in the room about being ill and the symptoms that tipped her off to her pregnancy. She was beaming. I didn't even feel jealous or upset about her pregnancy, because I'm finally at the point where I don't resent the happiness of others. I was upset because I wasn't brave enough to bring up my pregnancy and how I knew I was pregnant. I wanted to tell the story of how at 10 weeks I had waves of nausea and quietly moved the garbage can into the hallway so no one would know I was pregnant (didn't throw up). I wanted that bonding experience with everyone. I just didn't want to make her happy moment about my sad moment. If I had shared, it would have become all about me.

I had a MMC in May 2017. I went to an appointment with my midwife thinking I was 19w3d along in a pleasant and uneventful pregnancy. My midwife couldn’t find the baby’s heartbeat with the Doppler - a heartbeat I had heard roughly 5.5 weeks before. 

I get an emergency ultrasound appointment for later that day and the doctor confirms, no fetal heartbeat. This was over 1.5 years ago and some days the heartache feels the same as it did the day we found out. 

Anyway, I had a D&C two days later and a series of follow up tests and appointments. The problem is that I really don’t recall what was said during these meetings. I recall one doctor letting it slip that our baby was a girl, and that there was nothing to indicate I would have similar issues going forward. 

We’ve been actively trying to conceive since June 2018 and after a CP after Cycle 1, we’ve had no success in getting pregnant again. 

I decided to request my medical records through Freedom of Information for more information (we recently got referred to a fertility specialist but here in Canada, that can take some time getting an appointment). 

I’ve received two records so far - one from the emergency ultrasound and the second from the detailed ultrasound we attended the very next day. 

Both say, “intrauterine fetal demise with fetal hydrops”. I promise when I say this is the first time I have heard that word in my life, especially related to our MMC. 

Sorry for the novel and I thank you if you made it to the end of this post. Do you know what that means? Does it mean anything? Why would this not have been told to me by any of the doctors we met? We were told there was essentially no explanation for why our daughter died.

&#x200B;

I experienced a miscarriage on Jan. 13th. I was finally 6 week pregnant after five months of TTC our second. I had already been feeling the weight of five negative tests in a row after having such an easy time conceiving and carrying our first. When this pregnancy test finally came out positive I was elated...for about two weeks. 

&#x200B;

I miscarried naturally; they said it was probably chromosomal. I went through a grieving process and tried to move forward so that we could continue TTC since my doctor said that I could keep trying as soon as the ovulation kits hit a positive LH surge, which happened right at the end of the month. By then, I was just so happy to see that stupid little smiley face that I plunged into trying with so much excitement. We had already been having sex again and I was handling it emotionally so I just figured ""Here we go!"". 

&#x200B;

I was honestly surprised how calm I was able to remain for the nine day period to be able to take an early pregnancy test. After setting the test up I left the room and kept telling myself that if it didn't happen that it was okay. That this was a long shot - the doctor had even told me so. That maybe the ovulation test had been incorrect due to left over hormones...basically any reason I could muster to brace myself for a negative result. After the three minutes I went in to look and found the negative. I handled it okay, went on with my day. When I told my husband a few hours later it hurt a little to say out loud. Then later after dinner I mentioned something to my mom in passing and felt a deeper sting. By the time Saturday night rolled around I was really upset, crying in bed. 

&#x200B;

I tried to explain to my husband that I was upset about the negative test. About how I had considered that I could have been 10 weeks pregnant already, about how five months of trying had worn me down little by little... He asked what he could do and all I could reply with was ""I don't know"" because I honestly don't. I couldn't think of anything that would have made me feel better in that moment. After hearing my answer he held me for about two minutes while I cried and then rolled onto his back to surf his phone before trying to go to sleep. 

&#x200B;

The next day I was still upset. He felt like I was distracted while watching our LO and that I was moody and short with him when I got frustrated over small things like LO dumping the dog's water. Long story short, we got in a fight. I had my mom take LO for dinner so we could talk/have it out without him being around. DH doesn't understand why I'm still upset about the miscarriage, or how a negative pregnancy test could bring the memories of it all rushing back. He told me that he was not mad that I was upset/sad, but mad about how I acted because of it referencing the distracted parenting and mood. We argued some more about the same topic and then he told me that if this was how every month that we don't conceive is going to be that he's done, we aren't going to TTC anymore. That he doesn't want it this way because it's clearly too hard. 

&#x200B;

Our argument ended with me saying I would watch LO more closely and find another outlet to talk about my feelings since I didn't feel like I could talk to him about them. He was so supportive while I was miscarrying and the week of bleeding after. He would listen to me, talk with me, let me make decisions about telling anyone based on how comfortable I was. As soon as we told our parents I mentioned that I felt like I was ready to move forward and now I feel like I sealed my fate with that statement. He is such a logical thinker and seems like doesn't feel like he lost anything since it was so early...too early...since it was chromosomal and couldn't sustain life.

I’m not quite sure what to do at this point. I lost my first pregnancy at 7 weeks, as of this week I should have been 12 weeks along. To make things more difficult my twin sister is 36weeks and yesterday was her baby shower. I spent all day trying to be happy and keep it together... family who knew I had lost my pregnancy (who I saw for the first time since it all happened yesterday) did not even acknowledge my loss but instead kept away and did not make eye contact or really communicate with me. I ended up leaving the baby shower mostly after most people were gone and snapped at my mum.. then drove the three hours home. I’m an absolute mess. 

I’ve been to the doctor, about to return to work tomorrow after a week of stress leave.. he offered medication to which I declined and asked to be referred to counselling.. unfortunately they aren’t accepting referrals currently. 

Doctor said to wait three months to TTC... I just want so badly to heal from this and start our family.
