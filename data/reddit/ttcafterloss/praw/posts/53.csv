I'm seeking advice on how to spend the next week before we lose our baby girl. Obviously, there are aspects of terminating--as opposed to miscarriage--that bring special challenges. I know she still has a strong, healthy heartbeat in spite of the fact that she's slowly dying inside of me. And I have to be the one to sign away that heartbeat next week. But I suppose the silver lining of this is that I get to spend a little more time with her, knowing that I'll be losing her. 

I guess my specific question is: do you have any advice on how to spend this remaining time? For example, it occurred to me that I might ultimately regret not having an ultrasound image of her besides the fuzzy 8-week one where she just looks like a little gummy bear (they didn't offer us one at the routine ultrasound last week that identified the abnormalities, which I can understand). So, I asked them to take one before they begin the procedure next week. Even though it will be hard for us to see right now, I wonder if it will help us with the grieving process in the long term. Or should my husband and I listen to her heart beat one last time? I guess I'm not sure if these things will make the process harder or easier. 

Of course, I realize that most of these are personal decisions that will vary from person to person. But anyway, I'd appreciate hearing about what you found helpful.

Sorry if this is the wrong place for this, but I need to hear from those who have been through this before.
Also I apologize for rambling, this is somewhat hard to convey.

I need some closure and I feel 'stuck' between pregnant and no longer pregnant. 

Long story short, over the past 2 weeks my beta hcg levels were lower than expected for date, but had been rising until Thursday I found out they hadn't even doubled in a week. 
Sent for ultrasound to rule out ectopic (it wasn't). It was interpreted by the radiologist and relayed to a nurse at my OB's office across town, who basically said (over the phone to me) what the radiologist saw was measuring about 4 weeks (when I know I should be 6-7). Frustrating part is because my Dr wasn't in that day, nurse would/could not confirm a MC. She said they would have to continue to monitor hcg level and repeat ultrasound to check for growth (or lack thereof). Plan is for them to call me Monday.


Well, I started bleeding this morning.

Me processing/emotionally handling this loss is a whole other thing, but I feel for me to cope and begin to move on I need to have a definitive answer. I hate that I know this isn't a viable pregnancy yet because the doctors (understandably so) have a methodology to follow, I'm neither pregnant yet no medical professional will tell me that yet. To be fair, they won't know I'm bleeding til we speak again Monday.

So, my question is, am I crazy to just go ahead and have the glass or wine (or 2), take my extra hot bubble bath and begin to move on? I'm not looking for medical advice or anyone to tell me whats happening, but am I crazy for thinking it's obvious?

So having said that I'm very new to this site and I don't know any abbreviations, if i'm in the correct place, etc.

ANYWAY, not only has it left me emotionally broken and a hefty scar I seem to have a lot of issues in general.

As I had already assumed my periods have been all of the place since, which is fine, however what isn't fine is how much it's impacting my daily routine. It leaves me fatigued to the point I NEED to nap, I have so much pain before the familiar ache of pre period occurs and my moods, oh God my moods! My taste in foods and smells have changed, i've gained weight and I feel pathetic. I genuinely think that's the only word I can possibly describe myself as. I've done well in respects of recovering but I feel a HUGE change in myself and it's hard to control. There's a big empty hole inside of me that just throbs with a dull ache that I can't fix.

I have not got anyone other than male family members that I can really fall back on to speak with this and all my female friends have children, it's just awkward for me to approach them with this. My partner has been excellent but I really need to share some experience/stories with anyone willing. As much as some days are better than others I have so many emotions built up inside me since I lost my baby I just need some reassurance. Every cramp I convince myself it's something awful again.

As I had already assumed my periods have been all of the place since, which is fine, however what isn&#39;t fine is how much it&#39;s impacting my daily routine. It leaves me fatigued to the point I NEED to nap, I have so much pain before the familiar ache of pre period occurs and my moods, oh God my moods! My taste in foods and smells have changed, i&#39;ve gained weight and I feel pathetic. I genuinely think that&#39;s the only word I can possibly describe myself as. I&#39;ve done well in respects of recovering but I feel a HUGE change in myself and it&#39;s hard to control. There&#39;s a big empty hole inside of me that just throbs with a dull ache that I can&#39;t fix.</p>

<p>I have not got anyone other than male family members that I can really fall back on to speak with this and all my female friends have children, it&#39;s just awkward for me to approach them with this. My partner has been excellent but I really need to share some experience/stories with anyone willing. As much as some days are better than others I have so many emotions built up inside me since I lost my baby I just need some reassurance. Every cramp I convince myself it&#39;s something awful again.</p>

<p>Apologies for the long post but I hope there&#39;s someone out there who takes a few moments to read through this and respond, it would mean the world to me. Thank you :)</p>

Since then, I've had three early miscarriages, all at about 5 weeks.  All three started with severe one-side pain that radiated down my leg (different sides each time).  It was so bad that I went to the ER for the first two, fearing an ectopic pregnancy.  They found a mass next to my ovary and fluid in my abdomen each time.  A few days later, the cramping and bleeding started.  They said it was either an ectopic that resolved itself, or a cyst bursting that may or may not have anything to do with the miscarriage.  

So no answers, nothing they can do, all the tests for recurrent loss came back fine, and just keep trying.  I also have PCOS with long cycles (50-80 days - which drives me absolutely crazy), but few other symptoms.  The OB/GYN said they could give me Metformin (but I'm not insulin resistant or overweight), Femara, Clomid, or progesterone if I wanted, but none have any evidence of helping someone like me, and they all have side effects.  It just feels so hopeless.  How many more of these do I have to go through?  

My husband and I also participate in a martial art that involves full-contact sparring.  Enough people know what we're going through that showing up and not sparring feels like a public declaration of pregnancy and then loss.  I hate that, and I have been taking an extended break from the whole sport.  One of my miscarriages happened at one of our yearly retreats, and that was one of the worst experiences of my life.  I was surrounded by the sport, but couldn't participate.  I feel so bitter that I have sacrificed so much of my hobby, only to have nothing to show for it.  I feel guilty that I'm letting down my teachers by having to take so much time off.  I know that's not right, but I don't really feel they understand.  Has anyone else gone through this?

I haven't felt like myself since the last miscarriage in August.  My motivation for everything is so low, I don't want to be anywhere around babies, I cry when I go to the bathroom when I'm on my period because it brings back memories, and I now get excess saliva in my mouth when I cry (which only started during the last pregnancy, and just makes every time I cry remind me of my miscarriages).  We are taking a break from trying for a little bit.  We also just bought a house, and the stress of everything has taken a toll on our marriage.  We're doing some couples therapy, and I'm seeing an individual therapist.  But I'm so scared that by taking a break we'll miss an opportunity, or that by the time we start again, it will be too late.  I'm only 28, but I know that after 3 losses, there's a higher chance that it will never work. 

Sorry for the long post, but I don't have a lot of people I can talk to about this in real life besides my husband and therapist, and the only pregnancy loss support group in my city is 45 minutes away and $30 a session, so I guess I'm just looking for some moral support.",,False,,0,False,"Intro Post (3 CPs in a year, PCOS)",[],r/ttcafterloss,False,0,intro,0,,,False,t3_7sz9dg,False,dark,1.0,,public,6,0,{},,,False,[],,False,False,,{},Intro,False,6,,,self,False,,,{},,True,,1516942463.0,text,0,,,,self.ttcafterloss,True,"<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=""md""><p>We started trying to conceive just over a year ago.

At about 16 weeks while I was on holidays in Hawaii I had a random bleed.  Went to the emergency room on the advice of my midwife at home (Australia) and was cleared with ""threatened miscarriage"", but had plenty of time listening to the baby's heartbeat and a fairly long ultrasound.  All looked well. 

When i got back home, a couple of weeks later I started bleeding again (had sex and swam in the ocean, both of which were cleared by my midwife after a week of no bleeding).  From there it got progressively worse until I was having cramping, extensive bleeding and passing clots.  I was put on bedrest in the hospital for 4 days, and at my last ultrasound the baby was alive but my fluid levels were basically zero, and not compatible with the baby surviving.  I was induced at 20w3d and after about 10 hours of labour I delivered my placenta intact (I hope! No negative effects 2 weeks on) with the baby inside.  We got to hold him, we named him Rhys, and had a memorial with just me, my husband and my MIL before he was cremated.  

I am actually feeling kind of okay almost 2 weeks on.  The first week I would cry at ANYTHING - receiving flowers, a text message, seeing my husband, nothing at all.  This week I've started going to yoga every day, long walks listening to podcasts, and rewatching the West Wing, all of which seem to have lifted the sadness fog a bit. 

Right now I'm at a loss for next steps. I know its early days but so many people seem to be ready to try again ASAP - I am falling much more on the side of being done.  I have a 4 year old son and was lukewarm about baby #2 in the beginning (was ecstatic by the time mid-pregnancy hit) and am going back to my old way of thinking. Life is easy and uncomplicated with one amazing child - I couldn't cope with another loss, and not sure I could deal with the anxiety of pregnancy. I'm scared to get my period again because I am so triggered by bleeding after weeks of it in pregnancy, and it being a harbinger of negative things. 

Sorry for this being such a long post - I just needed to get it all out.  I would love to hear from anyone, but particularly people who decided not to try again after a loss.  There are so few stories to be found online that don't end with a rainbow baby or at least trying for a rainbow baby.

Maybe I&#39;m wrong anyway and nothing can make it easier. How have you all survived reaching your due dates and seeing your loved ones bring home healthy babies?</p>

<p>Also, how long does genetic counseling generally take? What have you done? Did you do any? This was our first pregnancy and going in young, healthy, and without family history we did very minimal testing (our doctors appointments including 13 week screen were all fine; the 20 week revealed two heart defects, a bowel defect, short limbs, and hydrocephalus/undeveloped cerebral cortex... the amnio didn&#39;t give us any information on why). I want a baby so badly and I guess we should understand our risk but even armed with more information I don&#39;t know how to do the arithmetic. Is there a probability that makes it not worth trying? </p>

<p>I&#39;m so sorry you all are here to answer my questions and give advice from your own experience. I just found this sub and am very grateful for it.</p>

Our story is a long one that ended today after 8 years.


I'm the husband.
I have a beautiful wife and a 3yr old daughter.
For 5 years prior to my daughter's birth my wife and I went through a number of fertility treatments ultimately ending with me trying the last resort of a failed microtese surgery. 


We were forced into using donor sperm. It took 6 attempts of IUI. But we got there. Perfect beautiful baby girl.


Fast forward to almost two years later we decided to have a second child. We used the same screened and anonymous donor, the same clinic, etc... We got pregnant 8 months ago and had decided on a name, Millie.


Millie was diagnosed with Downs just shortly before the third trimester started and duodenal atresia. Everything seemed to go well, no heart defects, no other issues according to neonatal care. Just that she would need to have surgery and a stay in the NICU for the duodenal atresia.


Last week the neonatal care doctor basically cleared us to have her at any point and everything looked good.


Today that all changed. My wife noticed no movement by Millie today. Last night she was kicking and going to town after some ice cream. She decided to go to the doctor because it just didn't seem right. Unfortunately, no heartbeat was found. Millie was gone.


The delivery process still has to occur in the coming days and we know there are decisions to be made. However, we have decided we want a legacy for Millie through donation to research for Downs or organ donation.


Does anyone have any suggestions here in the US?


Update: Delivery was successful and my wife is doing ok. 


The hospital worked all day yesterday looking for donations and were able to find an organization!


Luckily they JUST received a grant the day prior to the delivery for Alzheimer's and Downs research and they wanted her brain. They were extremely grateful as they do not get this sort of opportunity for this type of donation. The word excited seems like an overstep due to the circumstances, however the feeling my wife and I had to know that she, in her short life can potentially have a great purpose was amazing.

The mild cramping had already stopped by Saturday morning and by the afternoon the bleeding stopped. I came down wkth the flu at the same time.

I never had cramping, never had the ""contractions"", and the bleeding really was not a large amount. The only thing that makes me sure it was a miscarriage is the now negative HPT.

I thought I would be okay being around friends, but I was totally and utterly not okay. 

It was too late to leave, so I stuck it out, but all I wanted to do was cry and cry and cry. A lot of people noticed that I was acting different because I am usually very loud and outgoing. Many came up to me to ask what was going on and I didn't know how to answer. I think I just mumbled something about not feeling well. 

Some people who knew that I was pregnant asked me how my pregnancy was going, and I had to answer at least 12 different times that I miscarried, and that I recently found out. 

What was I thinking? I really should've stayed home, but the sense of obligation (bc I helped planned this party) made me go, and I regret everything. I feel like a walking casket and start to cry randomly. My poor husband doesn't know what to do and just keeps asking me if I want something to drink, to eat, or if I am too cold.

<p>It was too late to leave, so I stuck it out, but all I wanted to do was cry and cry and cry. A lot of people noticed that I was acting different because I am usually very loud and outgoing. Many came up to me to ask what was going on and I didn&#39;t know how to answer. I think I just mumbled something about not feeling well. </p>

<p>Some people who knew that I was pregnant asked me how my pregnancy was going, and I had to answer at least 12 different times that I miscarried, and that I recently found out. </p>

<p>What was I thinking? I really should&#39;ve stayed home, but the sense of obligation (bc I helped planned this party) made me go, and I regret everything. I feel like a walking casket and start to cry randomly. My poor husband doesn&#39;t know what to do and just keeps asking me if I want something to drink, to eat, or if I am too cold. He&#39;s so kind but so useless. </p>

<p>Question -- is there a way to speed up the natural miscarriage process? I&#39;ve heard some stories with raspberry leaf tea, pineapple, and doing sit ups, but besides those, anything else I could do? I really do not want D&amp;C (and my doc recommend to save that as a last resort), and I am not too keen on the medical miscarriage. I just want this phase of my life to be over so I can say goodbye to my tiny baby properly and TTC ASAP. Please any advice or things that has worked for you, please share. </p>

52,2048,confidence,<praw.reddit.Reddit object at 0x7f12a630cd90>,,ttcafterloss,"Hi all, 
Sorry for a novel!

We got pregnant pretty easily, so I wasn't sure whether to feel at ease or just more nervous. At our 7 week appointment (which I knew was 7+3 due to ovulation tracking) the baby measured 6+3. We saw a heartbeat and everything was great - the doctor didn't mention anything was a problem with it growing a bit slowly. I've since read that it happens and is usually okay. At our 11 week Doppler, the OB tried finding the heartbeat to no avail. Said sometimes it's hard to find it this early, but we were definitely feeling worried. Went in with the u/s and was taking his sweet time. The whole thing felt SO unreal - like a horrible horrible dream... He finally printed some stuff and turned the screen around to show that the fetus stopped growing at 8+3. No heartbeat. I was told it was nothing I did, and it can happen this early etc etc. We scheduled a D&C for 3 days after. Didn't cry too much till we made it to the car - then there were lots of tears for a couple of days (and still almost daily now). This was probably the worst day of my life. I'm a huge planner, and in my mind I'd planned the 9 months out (and after) and this is really hard for me to deal with on that front too...

Now it's about 2 weeks later and I feel fine physically and starting to recover emotionally. I've been mostly lurking in this sub, but feel like I can share my story and post more now. It's been sad reading others that have gone through similar situations, but it's so good to see there's a supportive hopeful community built around the sadness.

Anyway.. like I said, I'm a big planner, and this helps me cope also. I need to throw myself back into some non-TTC-related goals! So I was wondering, now that we are going to TTC again (and I assume many here are as well), what are some things you all are doing ""better"" and what goals are you getting back to this go round? 

 I'm going back to pursuing my weightlifting goals and getting back into gymnastics (both I put on pause once I got a BFP). Also having more energy now will help. Maybe I'll sign up for a spring 5k! We're hoping to buy a house soon, so I'm going to start the purging process (really had no energy for that before) and also concentrate on researching/searching for houses rather than be super distracted by pregnancy things. Some new goals that I wouldn't necessarily be unable to pursue after a BFP - reconnect more with old friends. This MC has really opened my eyes on the importance of loved ones and their support. 

In terms of doing things ""better"" this go round... We're drinking less now (started that before the first BFP too but pretty sure we conceived after a drunken Halloween weekend). I'm going to find what exercises, such as ones for the pelvic floor, are good to be able to do during/after pregnancy so I can have a heads up about that. 
What are you all doing better now or what goals are you pursuing again?

Well, I survived. Friday was one month since finding out our son no longer had a heart beat. Saturday was one month since delivery and saying goodbye to Lyndon. This weekend we were in a wedding; my husband, me, and my 15 month old son. Friday I did not want to do anything, I just wanted to crawl into bed and throw one hell of a pity party. I cried all day, but I pulled myself together and ran my errands and went to the rehearsal. At the rehearsal one of the groomsmen’s wives walks in and she’s 34 weeks pregnant, beautiful with a huge belly, and glowing. I lost it internally and tried so hard not to show it. We ended up talking to them and I tried not to show how sad I was. Ultimately, I was so happy for them and would never want anyone to feel guilty about their happy situation. At the end of the night she approached me and said she wanted to acknowledge our loss and was so very sweet. At the end of it all, my husband and I made new friends in this couple. They have also had a hell of a journey and experienced their own losses. So even though it was triggering to begin with, I’m thankful that we met them.
Also, I had a traumatic experience at the reception with my first pp period and I messed up my dress. I drank a lot and danced it off. This was such a hard, triggering, very traumatic weekend and I’m so damn glad it’s over. Here’s to better weekends!

<p>I don’t even know what I need. I just feel so lonely and sad and still not physically well and all I can do is sit on the couch and watch TV and eat and cry and my friends are like “let me know if you want to talk”. </p>

<p>I just don’t know what to do next and I don’t know how to get through this. </p>

Not sure if this is the right place to post this, apologies if not.

I am 7 weeks along. This pregnancy was a huge surprise though we have been ttc our second for 6 months (including a chemical pregnancy in sept.). I was supposed to ovulate on Nov. 16th but apparently didn't. I took 3 pregnancy tests in early December, all negative, and chalked it up to an anovulatory cycle. I got a prescription for provera, took all 10 pills diligently, but 10 days after stopping provera, there was no withdrawal bleeding. I went in for an ultrasound to see what was up, thinking maybe my lining was too thin to result in bleeding. Lo and behold! I was pregnant--I had spontaneously ovulated mid-December. I panicked, because it had never occurred to me I could be pregnant and I had not been behaving like a pregnant person. This whole week was an emotional roller coaster in which I counted and recounted every drink I had over the holidays, googled teratogenic effects of every medication I took, and generally attempted to wrap my head around this turn of events. Then, today, on the repeat ultrasound there was no heartbeat and literally no growth. They think the baby died within 24 hours of my first ultrasound. And obviously, I am convinced this is my fault--either for said misbehavior before I realized I was pregnant or for being so stressed this week.

So, I have to decide if I want to do cytotec or a D&C. I was initially leaning toward cytotec, but the stories online have me nervous.

We had just talked earlier today and she'd spoken about her fear of this exact thing, and here we are less than 10 hours later and it's happened. I've started doing research on what to say and how to act, but hearing from those who've experienced it is also very helpful. Not to detract from what she's going through, but I'm shaking and sobbing myself but want to support her 100% through this and I'm worried my own shock is making it hard to do that.

Apparently there's a cold going around. Oh dear. Let me call you a wambulance. 

The first thing one person said to me is ""While you were away so-and-so's cat got sick, so we're sending a care package. Want to sign the card?"" Uh, no. Since you didn't send a card to me, a human person who almost died, no I don't really want to. I'm going to give them the benefit of the doubt and guess that they didn't know why I was gone even though I announced it (in a brief, undetailed manner) in the public channel. 


Then enter the person talking about his spouse's rough first trimester. Oh, she was throwing up a lot? Boo-freaking-hoo. I had a rough first trimester in that I almost bled to death. Also, I get no baby out of it. So maybe have this conversation somewhere other than right next to me in the meeting. 


To be fair, some people were really sweet. These were people who are my work friends and I gave them selectively more details. One guy who lives in my neighborhood said if we need any help or errands done to let him know and another guy immediately empathized by saying he had had a gunshot wound to the gut that resulted in the same blood loss/ drowning in your own blood situation with bizarrely dismissive and/or giggly nurses followed by abdominal surgery.

It was surreal. There were all these people who were totally unaffected by this thing that consumed my entire being for weeks. </p>

<p>Apparently there&#39;s a cold going around. Oh dear. Let me call you a wambulance. </p>

<p>The first thing one person said to me is &quot;While you were away so-and-so&#39;s cat got sick, so we&#39;re sending a care package. Want to sign the card?&quot; Uh, no. Since you didn&#39;t send a card to me, a human person who almost died, no I don&#39;t really want to. I&#39;m going to give them the benefit of the doubt and guess that they didn&#39;t know why I was gone even though I announced it (in a brief, undetailed manner) in the public channel. </p>

<p>Then enter the person talking about his spouse&#39;s rough first trimester. Oh, she was throwing up a lot? Boo-freaking-hoo. I had a rough first trimester in that I almost bled to death. Also, I get no baby out of it. So maybe have this conversation somewhere other than right next to me in the meeting. </p>

<p>To be fair, some people were really sweet. These were people who are my work friends and I gave them selectively more details. One guy who lives in my neighborhood said if we need any help or errands done to let him know and another guy immediately empathized by saying he had had a gunshot wound to the gut that resulted in the same blood loss/ drowning in your own blood situation with bizarrely dismissive and/or giggly nurses followed by abdominal surgery.

On cycle 4 of trying, my period was due January 9th. I was feeling weirdly confident that this was the month, but didn't get my hopes up too far. On January 7th, I started my typical pre-period spotting. I drank some wine and came to terms with it not being our month. 

However, by January 9th, my period still had not started. On the 10th, I took a test and got a very faint but definitely visible positive! Cue total freak out. Went out and bought 5 more tests, got positives on 3 of them but negatives on the digital tests. I assumed it was just because the digitals are less sensitive, let myself get excited and told my husband!

The next morning, though, I took another test and the positive was fainter than the day before, and I noticed some spotting. I still stayed cautiously optimistic and made an appointment with an OBGYN.

But by the 11th, the spotting had increased, my positive was almost invisible, and I just knew it was over. On the 12th, I started the heaviest period of my life, and i knew that I had had a chemical pregnancy. 

I don't like using the term chemical pregnancy, though. I had a miscarriage, and while it was early, I was so incredibly excited and in love with that baby. Losing it was completely devastating, and I don't think I'll ever forget my first positive pregnancy test, my first baby. 

We discussed waiting for a while to try again, but I bought some OPK's and will be trying again this month. I'm nervous though. I can't see myself getting excited if I have a positive test this month. I'm worried that I'll be a depressed nervous wreck assuming that it will be another CP or miscarriage. 

I haven't really had anywhere to talk about this, so I'm glad I found this community. Other subs and online forums have seemed a little dismissive of chemical pregnancies, since they're so early it seems like some people don't think they can be as devastating as this was for my husband and me.

I elected to do the D&C the same day because I felt it would be less traumatic than waiting for it to happen at home. 

Everything went well with the procedure and I go for a follow up appointment on this Thursday.

However, the OB has reassured us that since this is my second pregnancy, and the first one resulted in my beautiful son, that my body has the ability to carry a pregnancy to term. This was just an unpreventable chromosomal abnormality and it's unlikely to happen again.

The pain isn't lessened knowing that there was nothing I could do. I still want my babies more than words can express. My husband and I are on the same page with TTC again though...we want to try as soon as we can. 

The OB said we can have sex 2 weeks after the D&C. I asked him when we could try to TTC and he said there really was no time restriction. He said there's no medical reason why I can't since it wasn't a molar and my uterus and cervix are healthy. He's not worried about needing a LMP since we have early ultrasound dating now.

My RE says the surgery isn&#39;t shown to increase fertility rates, but I want to try it before moving onto IVF.  If nothing else, hopefully it&#39;ll help with my excruciating periods.  </p>

<p>Anyway, I just bought an Ava fertility bracelet monitor thingy.  Hopefully the fertile window prediction is accurate and I can stop peeing on those LH strips all the time.  And temping is such a pain, I&#39;ll be glad to not have to worry about waking up in the middle of the night and needing to drink water or pee messing up my BBT!  </p>

<p>Ava gave me a referral link for $20 off if anyone else is interested PM me.  </p>

<p>So that&#39;s where we are right now.  Going to start using the Ava, have the laparoscopy, and then try a few more IUIs before moving onto IVF.  </p>

<p>Thanks for letting me introduce myself :)</p>

Me: 30F, four miscarriages, all with massive hematomas preceding hemorrhagic miscarriage. 

I've had all the panel of tests done and all come back normal - but this sounds like some sort of thrombophilia or clotting disorder. 

My doctor doesn't think so. She keeps pushing for IVF because she think my eggs are not good resulting in poor embryos. But why would I have the same condition over and over again?

I've been on baby aspirin with the last two pregnancies and still the same thing - 10x6 subchorionic hematomas both times. 

Am I crazy to think this is something else other than crappy eggs? I've had no issues getting pregnant via IUI (husband has low sperm count)

99,2048,confidence,<praw.reddit.Reddit object at 0x7f12a630cd90>,,ttcafterloss,"Hey all, I've been lurking for a long time, but I've been starting to post in the daily discussion threads, so I thought I should actually make my intro post. Also, omg I wrote a novel. Thanks to anybody who actually reads all of this!

tl;dr: MMC in June 2016, miscarriage in November 2016, followed by 10 more months TTC. PTSD from MMC, anxiety, depression, binge eating disorder. As a ""normal"" person, I crochet, play Overwatch, read a lot of non-fiction, and am learning to play Pathfinder.

I'm 28, and my husband and I have been TTC since April of 2016. We got amazingly lucky, and got pregnant on Cycle 2. Huzzah! Things were going great, we'd made it to the 8 week mark with no problems, actually announced to my family on July 4th. We spent Saturday at the mall buying gifts to announce it to my husband's family soon.

We had our first prenatal appointment, everything was great. We got our packet of papers, information, how to schedule more appointments, etc. We scheduled an ultrasound for the next day, because my family has a history of twins.

I'm not going to go too far into the ultrasound because it's still incredibly triggering for me. I'm tearing up just thinking about it and it's been a full year and a half. There's a post in my history about it, but it's on /r/babybumps. Anyway, it was a horrific experience, followed by a good hour of sobbing in the parking lot because I was 100% convinced something was wrong. We had to wait a full day to meet with the midwife, where she confirmed what I'd already known. Our baby was gone, and had been gone for a week or two. That time at the mall, we didn't even have a baby at that point. We announced on the 4th, and it passed somewhere in the next four days. But, the midwife had good news: ""At least you know you can get pregnant.""


I went home, took my Cytotec, and spent a few days crying. I watched all of Nurse Jackie curled up in my bed, miserable. Then I had to soldier on, because I was scheduled to attend a conference for work - one I'd really been looking forward to. Instead I could barely keep from crying, trying to keep it a secret from my coworker who'd come with, and going back to my hotel room to take some percocet and cry some more.


In retrospect, this left me with some PTSD. The entire thing was just so horrible for me, from the ultrasound to the doctor's office to the conference. I think of it all with a grey haze, and if the haze lifts at all, I just...can't handle it. Honestly, that's why I'm here. My therapist wants me to talk about it more, with people who understand.

After the first miscarriage, we had a few months off. Tried again, got pregnant again pretty quick! But had another miscarriage. I was already so anxious about it happening again that I was almost expecting it. It hurt, but not nearly as bad as the first one. By this point, I was more mad at the clinic system I was using. I ended up switching clinics, partly due to anger and their incompetence, partly due to them being triggering for me now, and partly for convenience.

We kept trying to get pregnant again for the next 9 months, with no success. Finally, a few months ago we took a break, put an IUD in, and gave it a rest. It did WONDERS for my mental health. Since June I've been in treatment for an eating disorder (binge eating, which got way worse when this all happened), along with my general depression and anxiety (issues that already existed before this all happened). Then add in some trauma, some PTSD, and here we are.

Whenever I think of all this, I just feel like I should be ""over it"" by now. It's been a year and a half - plenty of people have miscarriages and move on with their lives. But I still just feel crippled by mine. I feel like a lot of people have it worse, too. Like, I only had two. I'm still (probably) fertile. I didn't have a stillbirth, or any of the other amazingly difficult things people go through. So why am I complaining?

I still can't think about a lot of stuff, I still avoid a lot of things. My best friend at work is pregnant and I thought I was doing better - she told me and I was legitimately excited! Then she showed me the ultrasound pic and whoops, turns out those are a HUGE trigger for me now. So that kind of kicked in a lot of the jealous again, especially because her first baby is the whole reason my husband and I decided we were ready to TTC.

Anyway, I'm not sure I really expect anyone to read all this. I'm just trying to get it off my chest and try to share a little with people who have been through something similar. My therapist has been super helpful and I love her to bits, but she hasn't been down this road. We've been working on a lot of the ""I should be over it"" thoughts and the ""my experience isn't as bad as others"" thoughts, but she really feels I need support from people who've been through it, and I'm too emotionally stopped up to talk about this in person.

My husband's amazing, but he doesn't get it from my side, and I feel bad for not being as resilient as he seems to have been. My friend is pregnant, my other friend is having to take a break from TTC because of marriage difficulties so I can't talk about it with her, my mom's no good for this...

Anyway, thanks for listening, if you read all this. I'm glad to be around, and I hope I can be helpful to others around here too. Sorry for this post being such a downer - outside of this, I do a lot of cool stuff too - I crochet, I cross-stitch, I'm learning how to play Pathfinder, I play Overwatch, and am just generally a huge nerd.

We are coming up on the third year since we found out we were pregnant with our , now, 2 year old son. With that also means we are creeping ever closer to the 1 year Mark to when we lost Squid. With that it means we are officially 6 months in to ttc after our loss with no success.

Today is the first day that I have chosen to take care of me. I have left a toxic stressful job that has given me nothing but anxiety, stress, back spasms and possibly crippled my ttc journey. It caused my periods to be all kinds of out of whack (used to be 28 days like clock work,now we are all over the map). Has caused my self-esteem to plummet, and my ability to cope with everyday stresses to become zero. Every month when I would take a pregnancy test I would literally end up spending a week in complete meltdown and shut off from my husband because it was just another month down the drain of no success. It was something I simply didn't have the capacity to handle because of the stresses of my job. But not anymore.

I am going back to the same job and place I worked at when we lost Squid a year ago, the same people and the same everything. Less stress, a group of people that love and appreciate my contribution during my work day. And more importantly something that I enjoy and can be relaxed in. 

It is a job that allows me the ability to seek help from my doctor to look into what may be happening with my cycles and why we have suddenly struggled to get pregnant when before my husband looked at me and got me pregnant.

Thyroid panel 
Immunological tests (not sure what to call this. They took 9 vials of blood and checked things like clotting levels, etc). 
Chromosomes, husband and myself. 

I’ve seen an MFM out of town who said he could not recommend anything beyond what my OB has done. 
OB doesn’t think seeing an RE would be beneficial in my situation. Take prenatal, extra folic acid, baby aspirin, progesterone suppository 1 time daily. Only blood work I’ve had done WHILE pregnant is betas, which only progressed appropriately with most recent loss (11w). 

I know this isn’t a group full of doctors, I’d just like to hear what your experience has been with this process.

For example, if I see a cute kid, I immediately look at the mom and think mean things, like ‘she’s a bit frumpy/looks tired’. I found out yesterday that my boss at work is pregnant, and almost right away (after the shock wore off) I thought ‘at least when we have a kid, my husband will be around to help’ as she is a military wife and her husband is often deployed.

Don’t even get me started on how bad my road rage has become, especially if there’s a ‘baby on board’ sign involved and the driver with said sign is driving recklessly.

## 1. Before



For weeks and weeks your dad was wrong,  
all wrong, in the shower with sad songs on.


And now your mom feels a bone adjust  
and you have pulled the blanket up to rest


and wait and click in place and squint.  
We made you out of pills, blood tests, and footprints


back and forth, long drives stuck under the sun.  
Grow until you're tight in there, full-blown


berry on a branch. Don't be so sure  
of what you hear from us - the world's a bore


of half-strung, half-crazed, walled-in  
words and long divisions. Men are dumb as ever. So when


we play you James Brown, just get up off-a that thing, and nod your head.  
We don't know any more than you, little blade, tiny thread.  
&nbsp;  

## 2. After


The pigeon chicks outside don't know quite why  
they peep. We pretend not to cry, and wonder where you lay,


and if you will remain there, and the color of your hair.  
All week, the flitting eye, the looks away, the sighs,


and down here floorboards rotted out, the rug went bare.  
We tried again, we failed again; we'll try again.


But will you wander? Have you wandered? Did you die?  
Or just move on - your home forever - a creek, a willow tree,


some slick river stones to skip, and you there on the shore.  
So small, so still, so silent, quick, and gone.


Today, your mom is folding clothes. I am folding words. Together we
want more of you. And more still - more, yes, more.

A week and a half in I ended up Miscarrying. 2 cycles after I was still on metformin but started progesterone 3DPO. I ended up having a CP.

I am finally feeling brave enough to come out of the shadows :) My TTC journey has been really painful and it has taken me a while to really process and come to terms with everything. I saw folks reference this subreddit in /r/TryingForABaby and this looks like my home. I have been privately struggling with my pain. I am... I am ready to be an active member of this community and give support to others as well as accept the support of others <3

I chose this username because it means ""well-made"" in French and I think that despite my struggles with TTC, my body is, in fact, well-made :)

IRL I am an IT project manager, but my background is in plant science. My dream job would be to own and manage a greenhouse or tree farm. I love to grow things! I can't wait for springtime.

My husband and I grew up together (we met in middle school!) but didn't start dating until our early twenties. We lost touch with one another in college but reconnected after we both graduated....one thing led to another and here we are. We just had our 10 year dating anniversary a few weeks ago. We were married in May 2016, and started TFAB in April 2017. We both always knew we wanted to have children together but wanted to wait until I finished my postgraduate studies and got a steady job before starting.

Our TFAB journey thus far... I got pregnant in May 2017, but suffered a missed miscarriage at 10 weeks - my OBGYN thinks it was a blighted ovum/chromosomal abnormality because the sac stopped developing at 6 weeks and she couldn't see a fetal pole. Took my body a month to figure it out and was able to miscarry naturally, though I was hospitalized due to heavy bleeding and having difficulty passing the debris (I was having full-on contractions.) Overall it was a pretty devastating and traumatic experience, but I got the all clear to start trying again right away. And on the bright side, I now 100% know I want an epidural when I give birth!!

Well that MC really messed up my hormones because my cycles have been all kinds of wonky since - I've been ovulating regularly, but at different times, and have developed symptoms of luteal phase defect (10-12 day luteal phases). My cycle length has varied anywhere from 22 days to 39 days in the cycles I've had since then. The straw the broke the camel's back was that I had a chemical pregnancy this past November - got a positive test at 12 DPO and my period started that night. I saw my OBGYN with tears of frustration, and a progesterone test after that found my progesterone was really low in LP. So I'm on my first cycle taking progesterone supplementation during the LP. I also have a referral now to see a fertility specialist if I don't get pregnant this cycle. So...fingers crossed!

Feeling like a horrible person today. I should be fine. I’m a lucky girl with a healthy toddler. But this last year my husband and I have had trouble conceiving. It’s heart breaking. I’ve never known such emotional pain. We lost two pregnancies and it’s devastating seeing others so easily have a baby while all I feel like I get handed is heartache and failure. The second I started having trouble conceiving it was like everyone in the world was pregnant. The first pregnancy I lost might not actually be considered a loss, so I apologize if I’m using the wrong term. Our dr advised us that the fetus was most likely not viable and after much heartache we decided to terminate. It was the most painful choice I ever made and still hurts me today. After a few months my dr said I was in the clear to try again but after roughly 6 weeks I miscarried. 

Two close friends are married and just had a beautiful healthy baby. While I am over the moon for them, I’m also incredibly sad and envious. They were barely trying and announced to us they were pregnant at 7 weeks pregnant, it was a week after we had the termination, which they knew about. It was like being stabbed in the chest. Having to put on a happy face while you just want to cry and vomit until you disappear. They are two kind and wonderful people, they have been nothing but loyal friends for many years. I know they didn’t hurt me on purpose. 

And to top it off, I’m pretty sure I’m actually a terrible friend. I was judging her for being over weight. She would talk about how she wanted to lose 50lbs and get fit before starting a family but then made no effort and got pregnant right away. I try so hard to eat healthy, stay in shape and take my prenatals and going to the dr, I feel like I see my OB more than my family or friends. In the end, I’m just shallow and judgy though. 

My hormones are all over the map and I’m terrified I’ll lose another baby/pregnancy in the future. I find it hard to be happy because I am consumed with fear and worry. I don’t have anyone I can talk to this about. I’m ashamed I feel this way and I would be devastated if someone I knew found out. I know I’m being irrational and shallow, I apologize.

We had the amnio at 20 weeks because he was behind in growth, only measuring at 17 weeks. Looks like it was a problem with my placenta. I have PNH and even though I have been in ""remission"" for four years, the suspect it effected the blood vessels. Still waiting on the autopsy and placenta pathology.

They admitted me to the hospital, did 4 (maybe 5) rounds of miso before my water broke. I delivered 18 hours after the first dose. I was lucky and able to push out the placenta without intervention.

I went back to work 4 days after delivery. Life is such an unbearable and painful fog. People at work act like I had a cold and ask nonchalantly if I'm feeling better now. My boss is super pregnant and there is another girl at the office who is two weeks behind me.

I don't know how to function. It's still so raw and painful. I've spent the majority of the day crying in my car, the bathroom, and the stairwell. I miss him so much I can't even bear it.

I need some support right now. I also have so many questions but am still two weeks from my post-partum appointment.

I’ve written, deleted, and rewritten this post about 6 times so far. I’m not sure what I hope to gain...I kinda just want to talk. 

On Thursday the 4th, we went in for an 11w appointment/US. This was our 5th pregnancy, zero births. It was also the furthest along we’ve ever gotten, and had already heard the heartbeat twice and all labs had been perfect to that point. We were confidently hopeful, but nervous. Sadly, was no heartbeat. Baby measured 10w5d. 

D&C (my third) was early the next morning. (ETA: this occurred exactly 1 year to the day after my first d&c. Life is so fucked up sometimes...) My other two were at 6 and 8 weeks (though the second was a MMC and development was only about 6 weeks again). My other 2 losses were natural MC at 4.5 and 5.5 weeks. All of these have occurred since Aug 2016. 

When we first found out we had lost this one too, I was immediately done. Done with trying. Done with being poked and prodded and tested. Done with the cycles and counting and waiting and hope and disappointment. So angry. So sad. But I guess where I’m at now...only 5 days later...is that I’m utterly shocked at feeling like I want to try again already. It’s a really confusing and conflicting emotion to feel when I’m still so heartbroken. My husband deploys in a few months, for about half a year. We’d have the chance to try one time before he leaves if we decide to do that, otherwise it’ll be late 2018 before that happens again. We’re not sure which option would be best for us at this point. If we want to pursue any other tests or specialists first. If we’re (me, mostly), ready to hop back on the roller coaster yet.

128,2048,confidence,<praw.reddit.Reddit object at 0x7f12a630cd90>,,ttcafterloss,"As I've shared before, I just recently had my third miscarriage.  It was my second missed miscarriage--around 7 weeks I went in for an ultrasound and there was a ~5 week pregnancy present with a ""faint heartbeat.""  A week later, it hadn't progressed, and I took misoprostol and passed the pregnancy.  This was shortly before Christmas. 

At my follow-up ultrasound, there was a ""tiny"" piece of tissue they were concerned about.  My doctor said it could be a polyp, or it could be a bit of retained tissue and if it was the latter, it would very likely pass on its own or be reabsorbed on its own.  She instructed me to come back in 2 weeks for another ultrasound to check.

That brings me to today.  I had my follow-up follow-up ultrasound, which shows that ""tiny"" piece of tissue still there.  There's no way to tell without further testing whether it's pregnancy tissue or a polyp, but either way the recommendation is to have it surgically removed.  I'm waiting now for the call from the hospital to schedule that surgery, which will be very similar to a D&C (I also had a D&E with my second miscarriage in 2014).  

So, I guess my questions are, does anyone have experience with polyps?  Specifically, does anyone have experience with polyps and miscarriage?  Should I be concerned the polyp is indicative of a bigger problem?  

My doctor seemed to think if that's what it is, it's very possible that it's responsible for my most recent miscarriage (I wonder, too, if it's responsible for the relatively long time it took to conceive this pregnancy compared to my previous three).  I have a son born in 2015, and she said the polyp could have developed after that, which would explain this most recent miscarriage but not the two before I had my son.
