I had to go back to the office where I learned baby Leo had died. I wanted to consult a midwife because for the past few cycles I've had spotting for about 5 days before my period. I was worried there might be something going on there.

The midwife (who I'd never seen before) launched into a very condescending lecture about how clearly my mental health is bad and that I'm not ready to have another baby. Because I looked ""upset."" Like, of course I'm upset. I'm sitting three doors down from where I learned my baby died, and the waiting room had like 5 babies in it. She said that it's all just stress and that my body won't let me get pregnant until I'm done grieving. She even began to explain to me that I need to ""make room in my heart first"" for the next baby. Yes, I was totally planning on having a baby and not loving it. /s Loving my son and grieving his loss does not make me incapable of loving another child, because I expect that I will grieve him for the rest of my life.

Lectures like these are very difficult, because despite biweekly therapy, medication, and a pretty intense self-care plan, I'm still going to be sad. And sometimes I'll be tense if I'm in a triggering situation. Its just part of recovery.

1) Please, for the love of god, read my chart before you talk to me. Or, if you don't have time, ask me about my history and what's important to me.
2)If you've never heard of my condition before, a cursory google search might be helpful

&#x200B;

**Short Post:** I am on my 3rd chemical pregnancy in a row now, and I want to know what my next steps should/can be. I don't want to keep trying (without help) as I have no hope that we won't just keep having chemicals since it's been the case 3 cycles in a row now. I am meeting my doctor on Wednesday and would like to be better inform on what I should advocate for.

&#x200B;

**Long Post:** I‚Äôve been trying to delude myself for a few days now that my lines were getting minutely darker or that there‚Äôs this reason or that reason that affected the test for it to show up this light. I‚Äôve been using FRER on FMU and SMU and then picking and choosing the darker ones to keep hope alive.  And yet this morning my test was noticeably lighter. Not about the same (no progression) but lighter. (Edit to add: I've now started cramping and I expect I'll start to bleed in the next 24-48 hours.)

&#x200B;

My tests are so faint now I won‚Äôt make it to Wednesday for my doctor‚Äôs appointment (where I would have been able to get blood drawn). My doctor, who I saw briefly yesterday for other reasons, wasn‚Äôt concerned. (And neither was he when I had my first chemical and came to see him about it.) The receptionist wasn‚Äôt concerned when I expressed wanting a blood draw to confirm things weren‚Äôt progressing when I had come in to make the appointment. I would be very early, only 17DPO with a late implantation so I was allowing for a slow start. But now... I expect this faint line to be gone by tomorrow morning.

&#x200B;

And now I don‚Äôt know how to get the doctor to give a shit and help me look into this. It‚Äôs my third chemical pregnancy back to back. Yes - I‚Äôm lucky that I managed to get pregnant at all so easily in the first place. I‚Äôve heard that enough times. I don‚Äôt want to get pregnant just to win some prize for getting pregnant. I want to get a baby. So having none of these pregnancies get past a few days is really disheartening. And there‚Äôs nothing I can do without my doctors help. His motto is ""just relax and keep having sex"". I want to strangle him. (Not in actuality, but emotionally.) My husband doesn‚Äôt seem half as upset as me and all I want to do is cry. I thought surely 3rd time‚Äôs the charm. Nope. Fuck you life.

&#x200B;

Adding that, the advice to just keep having sex sucks in particular, beyond being dismissive, because I have irregular cycles so I could be having sex EOD for weeks on end, and I have very low libido. And besides, it seems the issue is sustaining a pregnancy, which having more sex won't fix.

&#x200B;

What can I ask for? What can I insist on? Or do I really actually have to keep going on this merry rollercoaster until we‚Äôve been trying for a full year? (It‚Äôs been 4 months.)

* I'm thinking of asking him to check my thyroid (again). There's history in all the females on my mom's side of the family of thyroid issues, but every time he's ""checked"" via bloodwork it's been ""fine"". I've been skeptical but what would I know.
* I also want to ask him to check about my progesterone levels? I understand insufficiencies here can cause CPs.
* I don't think the length of my LP is a problem as it averages at 14 days.
* I'm 29 and he's 37 if that makes a difference. Also I don't smoke, and I didn't drink much when outside the TWW to begin with. I take prenatals and folic acid.
* **TW:** we have a living child. I know I can carry to term. But maybe we just got exceedingly lucky?

&#x200B;

I really can‚Äôt handle losing another like this while knowing that no one is helping give them a chance in the first place. I don't mind that we aren't pregnant right away (although that'd be awesome), but this pattern of loss suggests to me that something is going on. I'm at the point right now that I don't even want to try if we're not going to get checked out/helped. (Well, really, right this second I'm too angry to want to try again but I'm sure I'll get through that.)

I want to get a baby. So having none of these pregnancies get past a few days is really disheartening. And there‚Äôs nothing I can do without my doctors help. His motto is &quot;just relax and keep having sex&quot;. I want to strangle him. (Not in actuality, but emotionally.) My husband doesn‚Äôt seem half as upset as me and all I want to do is cry. I thought surely 3rd time‚Äôs the charm. Nope. Fuck you life.</p>

<p>&#x200B;</p>

<p>Adding that, the advice to just keep having sex sucks in particular, beyond being dismissive, because I have irregular cycles so I could be having sex EOD for weeks on end, and I have very low libido. And besides, it seems the issue is sustaining a pregnancy, which having more sex won&#39;t fix.</p>

<p>&#x200B;</p>

<p>What can I ask for? What can I insist on? Or do I really actually have to keep going on this merry rollercoaster until we‚Äôve been trying for a full year? (It‚Äôs been 4 months.)</p>

<ul>
<li>I&#39;m thinking of asking him to check my thyroid (again). There&#39;s history in all the females on my mom&#39;s side of the family of thyroid issues, but every time he&#39;s &quot;checked&quot; via bloodwork it&#39;s been &quot;fine&quot;. I&#39;ve been skeptical but what would I know.</li>
<li>I also want to ask him to check about my progesterone levels? I understand insufficiencies here can cause CPs.</li>
<li>I don&#39;t think the length of my LP is a problem as it averages at 14 days.</li>
<li>I&#39;m 29 and he&#39;s 37 if that makes a difference. Also I don&#39;t smoke, and I didn&#39;t drink much when outside the TWW to begin with. I take prenatals and folic acid.</li>
<li><strong>TW:</strong> we have a living child. I know I can carry to term. But maybe we just got exceedingly lucky?</li>
</ul>

<p>&#x200B;</p>

<p>I really can‚Äôt handle losing another like this while knowing that no one is helping give them a chance in the first place. I don&#39;t mind that we aren&#39;t pregnant right away (although that&#39;d be awesome), but this pattern of loss suggests to me that something is going on. I&#39;m at the point right now that I don&#39;t even want to try if we&#39;re not going to get checked out/helped. (Well, really, right this second I&#39;m too angry to want to try again but I&#39;m sure I&#39;ll get through that.)</p>

<p>&#x200B;</p>

I wanted to add a gratitude post to the mix. I'm currently 5 DPO on our ""new"" cycle 4. We are 13 months in to our TTC journey. We took a 6-month break after an early miscarriage.

- This awesome community of people from all over the world who get it, who understand, and who jump in to help with kind comments.
- Family and friends. Everyone is alive and well. It's a good time right now.
- My relationship. There's no doubt that TTC has brought up some deep wounds. But my husband is working with me and he's kind. We are nurturing good vibes and building up our bank of positivity in the marriage. I know it will be so important for the challenges ahead.
- My dog. He's my first (fur) baby. He brings us a lot of joy.
- Where we live (Toronto, Canada). Making ends meet isn't always easy and we are working hard to set ourselves up for the future.

We had been TTC for a couple of years, then it finally happened we had done it. My best friend knew how excited I was, so suggested going for an early scan. I decided to go alone as I wanted to surprise as I wanted the scan photo home as a Christmas Surprise for my partner. To cut a long story short, I had suffered a MMC.
Before it happened to me, I did‚Äônt  even know this was a thing, let alone heard of it before. I made it to my car after reassuring the nurses I would now speak to my midwife and just feeling inconsolable, the pain that ripped through me was on another level, the loss I felt for myself and my partner was devastating. 
As this was over Christmas and no one knew, we carried on as normal and pretended that I had a ‚Äútummy upset‚Äù when I had to go in and have a D&C on the 27th of December. I became extremely depressed and had therapy, which helped enormously in our decision to keep trying again.

6 months on, we had had no success, so mindful that I‚Äôm in my 30s and it took us years to conceive in the first place I decided to speak to my GP, who referred us to the fertility clinic. My partner was tested, he‚Äôs fine, I had a Hycosy (this was fine) and blood tests, which suggested that I was not ovulating properly, so was prescribed Clomid (this was 10 days ago).

Last week, I decided to do a HPK as I has been feeling more tired and ratty than usual, and got a positive, I was ecstatic. I tested again the next day with a better digital test and got a negative. Praying that I was wrong I then tested again the day after with a basic test again, and the positive was much more faint than on the first, then 15 minutes later AF started. I was fine at first, shrugged it off, as we had a new course of action anyway, no problem. 2 days later, I‚Äôm devastated all over again, and I‚Äôm not sure I can do this anymore. 

Thing is, a decision needs to be made by me today. This is the day I‚Äôm supposed to start taking the Clomid. my partner reminded me to take it as he walked out the door this morning, he wants us to move on.

I've been going back and forth between the doctor and the insurance company (I'm in California, on a PPO plan, that doesn't cover anything related to infertility). My doctor was willing to work with me on coding the testing she ordered as ""DXL"" or ""diagnostics""  as opposed to infertility. I told her it had been an expensive year already due to the miscarriage and she immediately knew what I was asking for. Then she told me if cost was a concern and to avoid my copay, we could go over test results via email instead of coming back into the office. Bless her. It's not the copay I'm worried about, but the scare of having to pay thousands of dollars out of pocket for testing.

When I called the insurance company to get an understanding of the costs of the tests (typical infertility panel: FSH, AMH, thyroid, prolactin, etc.), the rep on the phone immediately asked me if it was for infertility purposes. My doctor told me to tell her it was for ""history of miscarriage."" The rep called my doctor, and confirmed that the testing was coded as ""diagnostics."" I definitely got the impression that the rep knew we were skirting the system, and she didn't sound pleased. Too bad, lady; get in line, none of us are pleased.

The good news is that I went in for my CD3 tests this morning after getting an estimate for the cost, just to make sure there wouldn't be any surprises. I was able to do this online for \*most\* of the tests, but couldn't find the right codes for AMH, prolactin, or progesterone. However, the other tests will come out to about $5 out of pocket each. Without insurance, each test would have been between $20-25 each. It's not the obscene costs I've seen elsewhere, but still a good chunk of money when it's all said and done, especially after all of the unforeseen medical costs from this year related to our miscarriage.

I researched the Modern Fertility route, but I was a little late on potentially ordering it, and it didn't cover everything my doctor wanted to test, so I didn't pursue it.

Next up: reviewing results and testing my progesterone on CD21.

Good luck to anyone else that's trying to get testing done in a more affordable way!
