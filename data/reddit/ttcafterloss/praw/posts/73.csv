Everything was normal. 

This should be good, right? But our RE still thinks our losses were genetic, random chromosomal abnormalities. And now that I’ve had 4 losses, my chance of miscarriage each time is up to 50%. 

Our options now are to continue trying naturally, do a round of fertility drugs and insemination to hopefully get more eggs which increases the odds of a healthy egg, or do IVF with ISCI and PGD. Only the IVF reduces the chance of miscarriage. If a transfer is successful, my RE says the chance of loss would only be 10-12% as opposed to the 50% chance with natural conception or insemination. 

I don’t want to keep having miscarriages. But round 1 of IVF with ISCI and PGD would be almost $20k. Our insurance covers up to 10k but still. That’s so much money. And its not guaranteed to work.

A little background on me & MH. I'm 28 & he is 30. We were ttc for a while with low morph and a luteal phase defect & ended up pregnant after letrozole + progesterone. At our 12 week NT scan they found a 7.5mm cystic hygroma. after a whirlwind of meetings with the MFM OB (who had the worst bedside manner EVER), an NIPT blood draw, and a meeting with a geneticist, we decided to get a second opinion while we waited for NIPT results. A week later, at our second opinion with a much nicer & wonderful MFM OB/geneticist revealed the hygroma had grown to 8.5mm & hydrops fetalis was present. After much discussion, we decided to proceed with scheduling the D&E the next week, knowing that the NIPT was most likely going to reveal our worst fears and that we couldn't stomach the thought of keeping this going when we knew the hygroma and hydrops were likely going to make the decision for us eventually. The Friday prior to our D&E, we got the call that it was likely trisomy 13. 

I'm now a little over a week out from my D&E, impatiently waiting on our cytogenetics to come back to let us know if this was a rare, awful fluke, or potentially hereditary. Which then leads my mind down the path of  ""will this mean IVf +PGD"" to the other extreme of ""do I ever want to do this again"". All of this plus my body is still recovering from being almost 16 weeks at the time of my D&E and I desperately just want to get back to the gym and lift heavy/sweat/fit in to my pre-preg clothes so I feel ""normal"" again (what is normal anyway?)  

I hope joining this community gives me a way to express myself to others who have gone through this and will help me work through all of the emotions I am going through.

the first ep. the main character has an accidental pregnancy, on plan B, and gets an abor!ion. for me the triggering part was just 'being in the room' with her during the procedure, I had a D&C and although not the same thing i'm pretty sure the procedure is similar for both.

It's been 3 years since we last were pregnant. 3 years since we had an oops in the bedroom that resulted in my second pregnancy, that would sadly end roughly 6 weeks later. We already had a LC and we were struggling to figure out how we would manage with a just barely 2 year old and a newborn, and all my struggles with health stuff during pregnancy plus a toddler and all of that. Little did we know the pregnancy wasn't meant to be.

Follow that up with shit care during our miscarriage, that may have resulted in me developing endometriosis and triggering PCOS. Both things that we had no idea I had (if I even had it prior to the miscarriage). It has been over 2 years of pain and suffering physically with the effects of these two conditions. We have done 8 cycles of Letrozole, all without any success. Back over Christmas I had surgery. D&C to reset my uterus in case there was anything wrong in there, tubal patency to see if they were blocked (spoiler: they aren't) and exploratory laproscopy to check on my cysts and to check if I had endometriosis.

Well I have endo, my uterus had adhesions to my pelvis, my colon was adhered somewhere else, it was a mess. Surgeon took down the adhesions, aspirated the largest cyst on my ovary (and sent it to pathology as a precaution) and at this point, over 3 months post op, we haven't heard anything from pathology so I assume everything is good.

We were given the go ahead to start trying again at our 6 week post op appointment and have been going ever since. Still with no success. I'm still in pelvic pain fairly frequently, we think the endometriosis adhesions are back on my colon, possibly back on my uterus, I don't know.

I'm back on letrozole this cycle and I'm not feeling any differences. My cycle is all screwed up. I have a week of bleeding that isn't my period, a few days of nothing, then my period. This month was different. We thought it was my period that came like 2 weeks after my previous period, so I started the letrozole. But also thought maybe this was the weird bleeding thing again. But decided to continue the letrozole. I have 2 different period trackers on my phone and one says I am now 4 days late on my expected period (tested this morning and a BFN so yay) and the other says I should be super fertile this weekend.

We have no answers. Everything points to we should be able to get pregnant. But nothing seems to work. It's been over 2 years of trying to get pregnant and nothing. Not a single pregnancy. ""Oh you're young!"" (I'm 27, DH is 29) but I also don't want to have like a 6 year old and a newborn personally. I wanted kids closer in age. But that's quickly slipping away. We don't really have much money to put towards things like IVF and other fertility counselling via a fertility center since a bunch of that has extra costs that aren't usually covered by private insurance.

My anxiety and depression is back in full force and I just want to give up. I've already had to reconsider my dreams of 3 kids because pregnancy and I don't get along. Now I may not have more kids despite wanting them more than anything right now?

I really think it will be counterproductive, because I will be so worried about the time lost that my stress might be worse. I know that pregnancy is hard on the body and I should be in as good a place as possible, but 3-6 months seems like so much. I told him my concerns and he just brushed it off, saying 38 is nothing, it means I still have two years. I don&#39;t know what to do, I&#39;m trying not to think about it so I don&#39;t just cry constantly and make things worse. Has anyone had to deal with anything like this?</p>

I’ll start with a short summary of our journey. I got pregnant in November 2017 and miscarried in January 2018. I stayed hopeful for several months after as I waited for my period to return so we could try again. It never did. We thought (doctors too) that it was stress related and my new OB decided to try to cycle me with BC in June. I got two periods using BC but never got a chance to check for ovulation because in August 2018 we discovered my pituitary adenoma (noncancerous tumor) that had been removed in 2016 had grown back with a vengeance. It was removed again in September 2018 but because we knew this surgery would be followed with radiation, TTC was put on hold again. 

Flash forward to now. Still no period, but saw my OB today and she suspects it has to do with pituitary function- not that something is wrong with my ovaries. So today I will start 10 days of progesterone and hope for a period. If it comes, I’ll then start Clomid. I’ve heard some scary stories about Clomid side effects.

I had to wear the surgical hair net thing, they had those giant lights, they transferred me in a wheelchair (due to regulations), the whole kit and kaboodle.  Afterwards it all felt like much ado about nothing.

It mostly just felt like a pap, except at one point it felt like she jiggled the speculum around.  That was the worst part.  I don’t know exactly what was happening at that point.  

The actual procedure felt like it was about 3 minutes.  I spent far more time prepping and waiting.

My husband couldn’t come in with me for the privacy of other patients, but one nurse was designated to stay with me and support me through it.  The doc tried to talk me through what she was doing but I couldn’t hear her well.  I did hear saying “fluid through right tube, fluid through left tube” but I couldn’t feel the actual fluid.

The doc told me right away, before they even lowered the table, that everything looked fine.   She showed me the screen after it was done and sent me home with the picture.

I did take Advil beforehand, maybe that helped.  The nurse said a hot pad on your belly helps, I didn’t need it but if you’re nervous maybe have one at home just in case.  The nurses were all very nice and wrapped me in warm blankets.

They gave me a pad right afterwards, by the time I was putting my own clothes back on it had caught the fluid and I changed into my own pad.  I didn’t have any cramping, but I didn’t even cramp when I had my MCs either, so maybe I’m just lucky that way.  

FYI They told me not to insert anything for a few days afterwards to avoid infection.  So no tampons no sex.  

One more thing:  my husband and I have been turning these RE appointments/procedures (granted only 2 so far), into little mini dates by going to lunch before or after.  I know not everyone can manage that with work schedules, lots of appointments etc, but I thought someone out there might give it a shot.

For me though, it makes no difference. I had already envisioned the next year in my mind and I had already started picking out maternity clothes I’d need in the summer. I was daydreaming about who he/she would be like. All that good stuff. I started bleeding heavily 3 days ago now and it’s still going. Btw - this would be baby#2.

I understand for men, that MC, especially early ones, isn’t as meaningful to them. Or that it wasn’t “real” yet for them. My DH literally told me that it’s not a big deal and we can just try again. I know he was trying to be helpful but it was just not. That’s the most support I’ve gotten out of him through this whole thing. It was the only sentence he has said about it at all. Since that short conversation, he’s totally acting like nothing is happening to me. 

I’ve reminded him that I’m still bleeding and I’m cramping. I’m tired and emotional and I just don’t feel well. Yet, he hasn’t offered to do anything extra around the house to make my day(s) any easier. He’s annoyed with me for being emotional. He’s just not understanding. Yesterday, I was pretty upset and I just wanted to snuggle up to him in silence and try to relax a little. He was gaming, and I let him know that I’d like to spend some time together before bed. He said okay. And I waited and waited and finally it was so late, I just went to bed. 

I feel so incredibly unsupported. I feel like he couldn’t care less. I feel like he thinks I’m overreacting. I’m aware that I am feeling extremely emotional. I’m getting very easily irritated. So I know I haven’t been the nicest either but 🤷🏽‍♀️ I just lost my baby. I think I’m allowed. 

Anyway, his reaction to this has me double thinking. Maybe I don’t even want another child with him. I can’t believe how unsupportive he’s being. We’ve had so many arguments the last couple of days that I’m starting to feel like I can’t even stand him. Maybe I shouldn’t even be with him. I can’t believe how much this miscarriage is driving us apart. 

So my question is, for those of you who have had a similar experience, how do you get past this? - As far as your relationship is concerned. How have you dealt with an unsupportive spouse during a miscarriage? Did you get though it? Did you end up separating? And lastly, is it normal to be this incredibly emotional?

Basically she’s 24 weeks but has been in limbo since 20 weeks. Her mfms have expected a miscarriage any minute but baby is still hanging in there. They are still saying everything from probable miscarriage to baby with major health issues. It’s very bad. 

She’s been leaning on me because I have a 6 month old (pretty healthy) who had a devastating 20 week ultrasound where our mfm told us we weren’t likely to bring him home and I’d had a previous miscarriage. But I knew within 10 days what had happened with each. I now have a healthy baby....and my morning sickness was so awful that I basically took drugs and slept for 10 days straight after our bad ultrasound. I just *didnt* cope. With my miscarriage I was a wreck for the better part of a year until I had a rainbow baby. 

I just feel so lost helping this friend. My mfms were dead wrong and in the end they were anything but helpful. But. They were looking at the odds and I do understand that they were preparing me. I’m having trouble because hers are also giving her really tough news every week, but my experience was that there was hope...I get that my friend is staring down the barrel of the worst news she’ll ever get. The thing that will wreck her. I just feel so helpless. Do I stay positive because I have the 1 in a million baby and so far hers is beating the odds? Is there a way to help her come to terms with a probable loss or a devastating outcome? How would you ladies best supported in this case? Any insight would be helpful

<p>Basically she’s 24 weeks but has been in limbo since 20 weeks. Her mfms have expected a miscarriage any minute but baby is still hanging in there. They are still saying everything from probable miscarriage to baby with major health issues. It’s very bad. </p>

<p>She’s been leaning on me because I have a 6 month old (pretty healthy) who had a devastating 20 week ultrasound where our mfm told us we weren’t likely to bring him home and I’d had a previous miscarriage. But I knew within 10 days what had happened with each. I now have a healthy baby....and my morning sickness was so awful that I basically took drugs and slept for 10 days straight after our bad ultrasound. I just <em>didnt</em> cope. With my miscarriage I was a wreck for the better part of a year until I had a rainbow baby. </p>

<p>I just feel so lost helping this friend. My mfms were dead wrong and in the end they were anything but helpful. But. They were looking at the odds and I do understand that they were preparing me. I’m having trouble because hers are also giving her really tough news every week, but my experience was that there was hope...I get that my friend is staring down the barrel of the worst news she’ll ever get. The thing that will wreck her. I just feel so helpless. Do I stay positive because I have the 1 in a million baby and so far hers is beating the odds? Is there a way to help her come to terms with a probable loss or a devastating outcome? How would you ladies best supported in this case? Any insight would be helpful </p>

Was I having periods? Ovulating? I was. Last month I got positive pregnancy tests for a weekend and Sunday night started bleeding. I watched my lines disappear. Today it’s been 28 days. Most my life my period has started on a Sunday. Losing my baby (CP) last month on Sunday had me on edge today. 

I’m 9DPO although my peak lasted a long time so I was unsure if I’m 8 or 9dpo. I showed positives at 9dpo last time that darkened. I checked my tests which are negative but I ovulated late CD20 probably with a strong LH positive ovulation cramps EWCM etc. 

I had some spotting today dark brown. Cramps. A little background I had bad cramps and bleeding off and on the first 15 weeks of my pregnancy and thought I lost Oliver over and over.

<p><strong>Please share positive pregnancy tests (BFPs) ONLY in this thread. Do not make a separate self-post about a BFP/subsequent pregnancy or post about it in the TTC daily thread.</strong> </p>

124,2048,confidence,<praw.reddit.Reddit object at 0x7f12a630cd90>,,ttcafterloss,"Hi,

  
TL;DR: Will waiting to TTC between pregnancies improve my chances of having a healthy baby? I'm looking for advice, experiences, opinions, links to good articles, anything you have. I will absolutely ask every professional I can about it, but I want to think about it from as many angles as I can. I can't ask my friends or family, I want them to \*stop\* thinking about my uterus.

&#x200B;

Some Background: My first pregnancy ended in a healthy baby at age 26. One year later, after two pretty average cycles, I was pregnant again. I MC'd at 6 weeks. I became pregnant immediately after, no cycle in between. It was discovered that my little girl had serious abnormalities and we term!nated at 23 weeks. That was 8 days ago. My doctor said there is no medical reason to wait if my husband and I feel ready, and maybe it seems wrong, but we do. We want to give our son a sibling who is close in age if we can.  


I don't intend to tell anyone (other than my doctor and midwives) that we want to TTC again right away, and I hope to hide my next pregnancy for as long as possible to keep people out of my hair about it. I feel strongly about my decision, it feels right. But I keep getting advice to wait - not that I'm asking!

&#x200B;

My MIL told me that I should wait to make sure everything clears out and resets. My friend told me that having pregnancies too close together can cause genetic defects because the eggs might be released immaturely due to my hormones being unbalanced or out of practice, a theory for which I don't see any support (go go google-fu) but which totally freaks me out. My grandmother told me that my MC one year after giving birth to a healthy son was because I didn't wait long enough to get pregnant again.  


I want to trust my doctor and my instincts, but I also want to make an educated decision. I'm feeling desperate to have a baby, and I don't want to let that cloud my judgment. Especially since I now feel that I won't have any support if I get pregnant right away and it doesn't end up happily.

Its 7 weeks since my miscarriage. Or chemical pregnancy. I'm not even sure what it was. I keep getting BFN (although I like to fool myself thinking I'm sure I can see faint lines which aren't there) and I haven't had a period yet.

I can't have my blood tests to check my LH until my period comes and goes. I just want something to happen now, I'm fed up. Whether its a BFP or AF to arrive.

It feels like a wasted cycle. All this time waiting for my new one to start is also time wasted where I could be trying. 

They say you are more fertile in the first 3 months after a loss, but somehow I feel like that won't be the case. 

I thought I was getting better over the loss, but today I feel like I've gone two steps back again. I want to curl up in a ball and cry and shut myself away.

My friend wasn't trying to conceive, isn't with the man shes slept with, not even sure she wants to be pregnant.. And is pregnant.

Yet we've been trying so long, all we want is a baby to complete our family. We have so much  love and stability to give and yet its just not happening. We've been trying 13 months now and I feel like its NEVER going to happen. 

You know when you envision your future and you can see yourself holding a beautiful little newborn baby? Its like that fantasy is getting further and further out of reach. 😔

<p>They say you are more fertile in the first 3 months after a loss, but somehow I feel like that won&#39;t be the case. </p>

<p>I thought I was getting better over the loss, but today I feel like I&#39;ve gone two steps back again. I want to curl up in a ball and cry and shut myself away.</p>

<p>My friend wasn&#39;t trying to conceive, isn&#39;t with the man shes slept with, not even sure she wants to be pregnant.. And is pregnant.</p>

<p>Yet we&#39;ve been trying so long, all we want is a baby to complete our family. We have so much  love and stability to give and yet its just not happening. We&#39;ve been trying 13 months now and I feel like its NEVER going to happen. </p>

<p>You know when you envision your future and you can see yourself holding a beautiful little newborn baby? Its like that fantasy is getting further and further out of reach. 😔</p>

<p>I also feel I shouldn&#39;t moan. I have a son already. I almost feel guilty that I&#39;m longing so much for another baby, why shouldn&#39;t he be enough.</p>

<p>Ah, I don&#39;t know.</p>

-I ordered a book called Not Broken. Heard it has research about loss. 
-Wrote down an action plan for how I’m going to stay on top of work during the loss, plus goals for the future to increase financial freedom. 
-Wrote down possible supplements and exercise plan I can try for trying to get healthy again. (Right now I’m just indulging) The thought of trying again sounds so overwhelming, but at the same time I want to look forward to it.

Hi,

&#x200B;

I had a D&E four days ago at 22+6, and everything seemed to go well. I had a week between the suggestion that something was wrong and the confirmation, and then two weeks to say goodbye to my baby girl between the diagnosis and the surgery.  I am a very strong person, with a fantastic support system and the wisdom to use it when I need to, and a lot of experience in dealing with difficult emotional events. I am very sad that I couldn't bring my daughter into this world alive, but I am grateful for the time I did have with her, and I will keep my happy memories with me always. I believe that death is only difficult for the people who are left behind, and knowing that my daughter is at peace brings me peace. I also believe that no one wants their loved ones to suffer, so the best way for me to honor her is to go on loving my life and being the best mother, best wife, and best person I can be.

&#x200B;

My husband and I feel that we are ready to TTC a sibling for our 1.5 y.o. son again right away, and my doctor says that there is no medical reason that we should abstain. I can understand how it would make people uncomfortable that we would try again so soon. The death of a baby affects people very strongly, very personally. I absolutely accept everyone else's right to feel however they feel about our loss. I know that our decision to start TTC so soon after our loss will probably offend some people and worry others silly.

&#x200B;

In defense of our decision, our doctor okayed it, and our midwives aren't concerned. I am a healthy person who does all the good things in moderation, no drinking, no smoking, and I'm taking my folic acid. I'm ready to try again once my cervix feels strong again. I can feel this desire coming from somewhere really deep, and my instincts all say it's okay. I don't feel guilty, or like I'm trying to ""replace"" my baby. After asking my husband several times about his true feelings about trying to conceive right away, he shared that he wants to have our babies close together so we're done with diapers faster. He is a wonderful loving man, but he doesn't like talking about his feelings. Knowing him, I feel that what he means is he's ready, and he wants me to stop pestering him about how he feels about it. It's a well felt, well thought through decision, and I am sure that we are ready. And I am sure that if we go on to have some early miscarriages, or even a repeat of the circumstances that led to the abort!on of our sweet girl (so unlikely), we will be okay.

&#x200B;

My problem is that I don't want everyone involved in the next part of our journey. People are already starting to pry. A couple of people have already figured out, because I didn't confirm or deny that we were going to wait a while and they know that if we were I would just tell them. I am feeling some anger towards one of them for her ""it's not my place but I would"" comment, and am anticipating that she will bring it up obsessively to try to change my mind, which will make me even angrier. I really, really don't want to be angry.

After we clarified that, being on cycle 12 and family history made us curious about fertility, he gave me a referral. I find out on Friday if I'm pregnant this cycle, and then they'll schedule me with the specialist.

Finally, he suggested therapy with a Maternal Mental Health Specialist. The social worker he works with gave me this list of books, so I thought I should share with all of you lovely people.

My husband and I were so excited at our first ultrasound, but sadly it did not go as imagined. I was supposed to be 9 weeks pregnant, but the ultrasound showed only a yolk sac. When the ultrasound technician told us, my husband almost threw up and I burst into tears. After we were given a few minutes to grieve by ourselves, the doctor came in and gave us our options. Since I was worried about the cost of a D&C as my husband and I are both federal employees and this was during the shutdown, we opted for the pills. I took them that night before bed and I woke up several hours later with really bad cramps, but only a little blood. I took some ibuprofen and went back to sleep. An hour and a half later, I woke up to the feeling of tissue sliding out of me. I rushed to the toilet and an alarming amount of blood and tissue exited my body. I started freaking out and woke my husband up. We decided to go to the ER because I was starting to get dizzy and it was a LOT of blood. At the ER, I had to sit on an incontinence pad in the hospital bed. I also had to wear an adult diaper on my way to and from the restroom so I wouldn't leave a blood trail on the floor. It was awful. I had a pelvic exam, an ultrasound, and another pelvic exam before the doctors decided that I needed a D&C after all. I only had a little bleeding after the D&C. I healed up well physically, but emotionally I'm still raw. My husband doesn't want to talk about it, but he comforts me when I need it. I'm seeing a psychologist now, so that's going well, and I'm working through it. My doctor said we have to wait 3 months to try again, so we still have another month and a half to wait.

Today I finally got my first period post-miscarriage, and I have some questions. Was your first period post-miscarriage an unusual color or consistency?
