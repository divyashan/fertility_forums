Husband (30M) and I (28F) started ttc #1 in Feb 2018. We got really lucky on the second cycle. Unfortunately, when we went in for a second ultrasound in May, after seeing a heartbeat flicker at the first, we got bad news. Things had stopped growing around 7 weeks. I was crushed. My husband was sad as well, but remained outwardly stoic. 

We were given the standard options and I chose to take cytotec vaginally at home. We then followed my hcg levels down. That took 10 long weeks. It took so long that my OB recommend a d and c at week 8 post cytotec.  I had the procedure to remove retained tissue. Thankfully that worked. I remember leaving the surgery center feeling so empty and sad.

We started trying again in September. Again, we got lucky on the second cycle. This time I called my OB immediately after my positive and asked for blood work. We tested my hcg and progesterone. All of my levels looked great. I'm really close with my OB (I used to work in her office) and together we decided that I would go ahead and start progesterone suppositories for peace of mind. I had some spotting, but I was cautiously optimistic. During the first ultrasound at 6 weeks and a few days we saw a heartbeat. My OB doesn't like to listen to it that early, but it was there. Because of our first loss, she said we could come back two weeks later instead of the standard four to check for a heartbeat again. Our next ultrasound was at the end of November. Unfortunately, there was no longer a heartbeat. I cried on the exam table and had a hard time looking my husband in the eye. I couldn't understand why this was happening again.

This time we opted for the d and c right away so that we could do genetic testing. My OB also ordered a bunch of tests for recurrent pregnancy loss. So far, everything has come back normal. I have the hysterosalpingogram scheduled next week. My OB thinks that there is a chance that I could have a uterine septum. That may have been what caused the cytotec to not fully work the first time around? She also had some difficulty with the second d and c. 

So now we're just waiting and hoping for some answers. I'm so torn because I don't want anything to be wrong, but at the same time, I want there to be something that we can fix. If the hsg comes back normal, we won't have an answer. I hate the idea of trying again without doing anything differently and just hoping for the best. I never thought I'd be in this situation. It sucks. But I'm really glad this community exists. Between this and my therapist, I'm slowly feeling better.

Dec-17 mmc resulting in D&C and genetic testing to find two chromosomal abnormalities which cause the loss. Had a spontaneous loss in August-18 at 6.5 weeks. Then last week I was 5.5. I also have TW: one LC who is 3.5 years old. His pregnancy and labor were unicorns. And one early loss before him. So at this point I‚Äôve had 5 pregnancies and one LC. I have a short cycle 25-26 days so I always find out early.

After my loss last week I went full boar on testing - lupus, panel, and exploratory US, thyroid, clotting, karaotype  - so far everything is good - haven‚Äôt gotten then karaotype results yet. And my progesterone was fine at my first draw. 

So my two doctors are like let‚Äôs start with the above tests and if they come back we look at more - but neither my OB or my naturopath (I work at the naturopath- she‚Äôs a hormone guru in my town and it‚Äôs more just a second set of eyes) have not given me a real answer of what‚Äôs next testing wise..

I guess I‚Äôm not looking for specific medical advice but more experiences of what typically comes next - do I see a fertility expert? Which feels incorrect because I can fortunately get pregnant easily I just can‚Äôt get them to stick...

Also are there proven things to help with Egg health. I‚Äôm 32 but suddenly it feels like my eggs are not in the best shape or something...


And health backstory I am 32 and my husband is 41. Before we tried I would smoke a little pot 3-4 times a week after my son goes to bed -hashtag it‚Äôs legal here lol - and I drink 2-3 times a week. I eat generally healthy, don‚Äôt exercise much but I am active, walk our dog, chase my son around and ski. I love my coffee - homemade drip - two cups a day. Our family has had significant stress lately, however my midwife was like um stress would not cause a miscarriage at this early.

When I said that was our EDD, he said he knew but he&#39;s moved on and he thought I had too. </p>

<p>Ugh. Am I being weird here or what? I know they were only 8wks old when they died but it still sucks and I don&#39;t know why but I can&#39;t just &#39;get over it&#39; as he has. </p>

<p>I hardly think about it now but when I do, it still hurts and I don&#39;t think it&#39;s that weird to do something a little special on the EDD or at least something to take my mind off of it...this is especially difficult because he is <em>sooo</em> caring and loving, so why is this the thing he has to be an ass about?</p>

My question is essentially about ovulation after a mc. Fertility Friend has my cycle day one starting the first day of full bleeding --- okay, so that was January 4. My mc took place at 6 weeks pregnant and I bled for a full week. On January 3, my beta was 118 and a week later it was down to 9.

I am trying to track my ovulation so I can at least understand what my body is doing for now, and at best, TTC again as soon as I can. Emotionally and physically I feel just fine, surprisingly.

According to FF, I would have ovulated this week. I used OPKs all week and had two days of very faint (so negative) lines and today, CD14, it is stark negative. Should I have ovulated this week as planned? I know there are a lot of variables to this question, but I am trying to sort out what others have experienced, I guess. I also anticipated a normal return of my cycle around February 1 --- if I am not yet or won't ovulate between now and then, should I anticipated a delayed period, too?

I got pregnant from my first IUI and I have a work trip in February that will prevent another IUI (and thus, another cycle), if I don't start my next period at the first of February. I am just frustrated by all of this loss in time. I am old and feel like this really set me back a few very precious months.

But even after all of that, I thought we would grieve, and then start trying again in February at the latest. </p>

<p>What I didn‚Äôt expect was so be so all over the place with how I feel. 2 weeks ago I told DH that I was ready to start trying again right away, that I missed being pregnant and it was all I could think about. A few days later I changed my mind, and thought were only 26, why don‚Äôt we go on another trip and wait until summer to try. I can‚Äôt seem to make up my mind about how I feel and what I‚Äôm ready for. On one hand I miss so much being pregnant and excited about the future, and on the other hand my husband and I have grown even closer in the last 6 weeks, and I want more time for just the two of us. If we go down south in a couple months, then we have to worry about Zika and waiting 3 months after we get back. So it‚Äôs not like we could move up our date even if we wanted to. So conflicted :(</p>

As Keller gets older and we realize that he will never have a sibling he can be in school with, share toys with, make life long memories with. It‚Äôs all wiped away.

&#x200B;

So we planned to go in for an exploratory laparoscopic surgery to look for endometriosis, check on my large cyst on my right ovary, tubal patency, and a D&C.

&#x200B;

We left not knowing what happened because ""reasons"". No one in post op could tell us what happened other than we are good to go home and wait for our follow up in a month with the surgeon. So yay waiting with a whole bunch of questions in my head all over Christmas holidays. Relaxing and enjoying time with family? nahhhhhhh didn't want that!!!

&#x200B;

Anyways, so yeah, had surgery, things went well and here we are. What we found out are as follows:

&#x200B;

**Confirmed endometriosis.**  



\-multiple adhesions on multiple areas including my colon (which explains the random super bad pain and constipation that didn't seem to be coming \*From\* my bowels, but rather all of the space around it) somewhere on my reproductive tract to somewhere on my pelvic wall. All around a mess in there of shit that don't belong!



\- Adhesions were treated and resected (not sure if by laser or how they did it off hand) and things are good.

&#x200B;

**Checked on the ""huge"" (2cm) ovarian cyst on my right ovary.**



\- they cauterized it, drained it of whatever fluid, and it collapsed, and the ovary ""collapsed"" to normal.



\- the other cysts look pretty average and nothing to worry about for the moment as they are too small to be bothered with. Chances of ""more harm than good"" should they choose to mess with them.

&#x200B;

**Tubal patency dye test was completed.**

&#x200B;

\- both left and right tube passed with flying colours, everything is clear, no blockages and they are happy little tubes being happy little highways of eggs.

&#x200B;

**D&C was completed with no real concern or anything remarkable found.**

&#x200B;

So where does that leave us? Well we have diagnosis of PCOS, Endometriosis, and unexplained secondary infertility. We have been given the go ahead to start boning like bunnies again, continue taking a prenatal, extra folic acid, all those good things. We are NOT going back on letrozole right now as a way to ease my body bad into doing normal body things but now without the whole cyst or endo tissue hanging out for the party. Also I didn't really like the way letrozole made me feel, and it caused some secondary issues as well.

&#x200B;

For the next 3 cycles we are going to chart my temp, general tracking of my cycle and CM etc etc and just do the dirty as much as we want. (Also, it's been a long 6 weeks. Holy hell). If in 3 months there's no pregnancy we will look into restarting letrozole. If, after 3 months of letrozole (so 6 more months TTC) we still have no success we will be getting a referral to a local fertility clinic.

We asked him a few questions about what happened post op and my care for after surgery. There were stitches but we were not informed of them. They were supposed to dissolve but they never did. (He mentioned all 3 incisions had stitches, but my one incision was being a bitch, so he couldn't manage to make those stitches by ""hidden"" under my skin so they remained above the skin). He very sincerely apologized and you could tell he was upset by what happened and how we weren't very happy about the situation and how it was handled. But given how upset he was about it, we won't be pursuing anything any further than this.

&#x200B;

So yeah. Just waiting on my first period after surgery to finish (seriously I feel like I've been wearing a monstrous pad for the last 2 months now... I had my period end 2 days before surgery, then had the surgery and bled for a good 2ish weeks, and now I'm on day like 10 of this first period. Fuck sakes). But I'm now officially allowed back in the ring of actively TTC again and I couldn't be happier.

<p>&#x200B;</p>

<p>So we planned to go in for an exploratory laparoscopic surgery to look for endometriosis, check on my large cyst on my right ovary, tubal patency, and a D&amp;C.</p>

<p>&#x200B;</p>

<p>We left not knowing what happened because &quot;reasons&quot;. No one in post op could tell us what happened other than we are good to go home and wait for our follow up in a month with the surgeon. So yay waiting with a whole bunch of questions in my head all over Christmas holidays. Relaxing and enjoying time with family? nahhhhhhh didn&#39;t want that!!!</p>

<p>&#x200B;</p>

<p>Anyways, so yeah, had surgery, things went well and here we are. What we found out are as follows:</p>

<p>&#x200B;</p>

<p><strong>Confirmed endometriosis.</strong>  </p>

<p>-multiple adhesions on multiple areas including my colon (which explains the random super bad pain and constipation that didn&#39;t seem to be coming *From* my bowels, but rather all of the space around it) somewhere on my reproductive tract to somewhere on my pelvic wall. All around a mess in there of shit that don&#39;t belong!</p>

<p>- Adhesions were treated and resected (not sure if by laser or how they did it off hand) and things are good.</p>

<p>&#x200B;</p>

<p><strong>Checked on the &quot;huge&quot; (2cm) ovarian cyst on my right ovary.</strong></p>

<p>- they cauterized it, drained it of whatever fluid, and it collapsed, and the ovary &quot;collapsed&quot; to normal.</p>

<p>- the other cysts look pretty average and nothing to worry about for the moment as they are too small to be bothered with. Chances of &quot;more harm than good&quot; should they choose to mess with them.</p>

<p>&#x200B;</p>

<p><strong>Tubal patency dye test was completed.</strong></p>

<p>&#x200B;</p>

<p>- both left and right tube passed with flying colours, everything is clear, no blockages and they are happy little tubes being happy little highways of eggs.</p>

<p>&#x200B;</p>

<p><strong>D&amp;C was completed with no real concern or anything remarkable found.</strong></p>

52,2048,confidence,<praw.reddit.Reddit object at 0x7f12a630cd90>,,ttcafterloss,"Hi all. I think I‚Äôm finally emotionally ready to talk about my MMC. I‚Äôm sorry if this is long; the only people that know about it are my mom and my husband. I‚Äôm an ex-July bumper; I left without saying goodbye because I didn‚Äôt want to stress the other expecting moms.  
 

My husband and I were thrilled to find out we were expecting our first child. We bought little onesies to gift to family members on Christmas that read ""Your gift will arrive in July 2019"". They're all hiding in a box in my closet right now.

  
Our first ultrasound was the first red flag. I was supposed to be 6 weeks but all we saw was the gestational sac. Our OB said it was probably too early to see anything. It still bothered me.   


At my 8 week ultrasound, we finally saw the little nugget. It had a good heartbeat of 150bpm but it was measuring 2 weeks behind. I felt like something was off but at least there was a heartbeat. My OB was optimistic and scheduled me to come back in 1 month.   


My last ultrasound was scheduled on Christmas Eve. During the weeks leading up the appointment, my pregnancy symptoms began fading. I no longer felt the fatigue and nausea. All my bloating went down. A lot of people assured me that lack of symptoms doesn‚Äôt always mean something bad is happening, but I just knew. Then, on the day of the appointment, I began spotting. I braced myself for the worse.  


The minute I saw that black, empty ultrasound screen, I knew our Peanut was gone. My doctor was silent as he tried his best to search for the nugget, but it was gone. Not even a heartbeat.  


My husband and I were in a daze. We walked out of that office numb. We walked the streets for hours; confused, angry, devastated and in denial.   


I just had my D&C done 1 week ago. I feel a sense of relief but also emptiness. I feel like a gift was given to me and then snatched away. I feel like my emotions have been toyed with. I want to be strong and move on, but some days I just want to disappear. What makes things worse is my sister-in-law (who never showed interest in having children) just announced her pregnancy and she is due in August. She's coming to town this week and the whole family is celebrating her pregnancy. The timing is so ironic. I lost my baby as she gained hers. She doesn‚Äôt know I had a miscarriage so it‚Äôs difficult hiding the pain and being happy for her at the same time. I don't want to mention my miscarriage to her because I don't want to freak her out. She's only 9 weeks.  


My husband and I decided to TTC after my first cycle. I‚Äôm so scared of another miscarriage. I hate that my next pregnancy will be filled with dread and anxiety instead of joy and excitement.

I think I‚Äôm finally emotionally ready to talk about my MMC. I‚Äôm sorry if this is long; the only people that know about it are my mom and my husband. I‚Äôm an ex-July bumper; I left without saying goodbye because I didn‚Äôt want to stress the other expecting moms.  </p>

<p>My husband and I were thrilled to find out we were expecting our first child. We bought little onesies to gift to family members on Christmas that read &quot;Your gift will arrive in July 2019&quot;. They&#39;re all hiding in a box in my closet right now.</p>

<p>Our first ultrasound was the first red flag. I was supposed to be 6 weeks but all we saw was the gestational sac. Our OB said it was probably too early to see anything. It still bothered me.   </p>

<p>At my 8 week ultrasound, we finally saw the little nugget. It had a good heartbeat of 150bpm but it was measuring 2 weeks behind. I felt like something was off but at least there was a heartbeat. My OB was optimistic and scheduled me to come back in 1 month.   </p>

<p>My last ultrasound was scheduled on Christmas Eve. During the weeks leading up the appointment, my pregnancy symptoms began fading. I no longer felt the fatigue and nausea. All my bloating went down. A lot of people assured me that lack of symptoms doesn‚Äôt always mean something bad is happening, but I just knew. Then, on the day of the appointment, I began spotting. I braced myself for the worse.  </p>

<p>The minute I saw that black, empty ultrasound screen, I knew our Peanut was gone. My doctor was silent as he tried his best to search for the nugget, but it was gone. Not even a heartbeat.  </p>

<p>My husband and I were in a daze. We walked out of that office numb. We walked the streets for hours; confused, angry, devastated and in denial.   </p>

<p>I just had my D&amp;C done 1 week ago. I feel a sense of relief but also emptiness. I feel like a gift was given to me and then snatched away. I feel like my emotions have been toyed with. I want to be strong and move on, but some days I just want to disappear. What makes things worse is my sister-in-law (who never showed interest in having children) just announced her pregnancy and she is due in August. She&#39;s coming to town this week and the whole family is celebrating her pregnancy. The timing is so ironic. I lost my baby as she gained hers. She doesn‚Äôt know I had a miscarriage so it‚Äôs difficult hiding the pain and being happy for her at the same time. I don&#39;t want to mention my miscarriage to her because I don&#39;t want to freak her out. She&#39;s only 9 weeks.  </p>

<p>My husband and I decided to TTC after my first cycle. I‚Äôm so scared of another miscarriage. I hate that my next pregnancy will be filled with dread and anxiety instead of joy and excitement. I don&#39;t even know where to start. Everything feels so overwhelming now. I want to get more involved in TTC by knowing my HCG levels, etc. but my OB never even tested me for that.  Anyway, thank you for hearing me out and I&#39;m sorry for we all have to meet like this, but I also understand it&#39;s important to find support during difficult times.  </p>

This has never happened before in my life. In fact, the first time it happened, my OB had me take a pregnancy test in her office, even though I'd already had my period AND negative HPT. Both times it started after intercourse, so this month (cycle 5) I chose not to have PIV sex since 5 DPO. Last night as I was falling asleep I had a sudden, strong pain in my side and this morning (9 DPO, CD 19) there was brown spotting when I wiped. 

&#x200B;

So now this is three unusual cycles in a row. The only change is that this happened after I started Zoloft, which everyone - my OB, the MFM specialist, and my therapist - all said was the safest thing to do while TTC/during pregnancy. I know that Zoloft has bleeding risks and I've seen anecdotally people who say it lengthened their cycles but I can't find anything about it causing spotting/long periods. 

&#x200B;

I'm upset, because I thought this would happen faster. I cannot go a whole year without getting checked for a problem - I don't think I can survive Jubilee's first birthday with no LC in sight. I was already going to push my OB to give me a referral after cycle 6, but should I see her earlier after three totally out-of-the-normal periods? Of course, I could still be pregnant, so I should probably wait to reach out until after I definitely have a period. But I also feel like I'm definitely not pregnant - I was so hopeful that first month that since this bleeding was so out of the ordinary, it must be implantation bleeding and I would be pregnant.

&#x200B;

I feel like almost everyone I follow on the same timeline as me - stillbirth with no prior fertility problems - is already pregnant. Someone I follow on Instagram just got pregnant with her rainbow on cycle 4 and is posting about it basically in real time with the intention of not hiding a possible miscarriage and I'm sure that that is helpful for a lot of people to see but it's just killing me inside. I feel like I was doing really well until yesterday went poorly - I got blood drawn for an insurance thing at work, which spiraled me back to being in the hospital, and then the person in line behind me was the woman who had her high-risk twins just after I lost Jubilee. I had literally just been thinking ""wow, I don't passively want to be dead anymore!"" and now it's back. So if it's the Zoloft messing up my cycle... now I have a choice between soldiering on with TTC unmedicated, or sticking with the Zoloft \*even though the thing making me most depressed is NOT BEING PREGNANT!\*

 I saw this article today and thought it‚Äôd be a good share, not only for the TFMR moms but this community in general. I thought it was particularly good for several reasons. It‚Äôs raising awareness of TFMR in the case of wanted pregnancies that are affected by severe fetal impairment, and it puts a human face on what is usually an abstract idea.

It also significantly highlights the inequality between TFMR treatment in different states. It‚Äôs unbelievable to me that many states have passed legislation banning insurance coverage of abort!on, even in the case of fetal impairment. It also makes the point that these inequities affect so much of the population, from the poor to the upper-middle class. 

In the article, TFMR is discussed in a family-centered manner - using language that is not commonly used in the context of abort!on (e.g., ""my daughter"" and not ""the fetus""-- this is actually the language that most of us TFMR mothers use!). Hopefully, this humanizes the situation for any pro-life readers who are used to thinking about abort!on only as an elective process.

Finally, it educates readers about what ""severe fetal impairment"" *really* means. It is not the nice boy with Down Syndrome who helps you with your groceries. These are devastating, painful health problems with no cure that usually kill babies shortly after birth.

There is such a social stigma associated with terminating for medical reasons, on top of the already-excruciating pain of losing your child and having been the one to decide to do so.

I'm new to this subreddit as I've just experienced my first loss in my first pregnancy. 

We were lucky to get pregnant on our 3rd cycle trying, but after a few days of spotting followed by heavy bleeding, yesterday at 5w5d we lost the little peppercorn-sized baby. We were able to confirm today at the hospital that my hcg levels had dropped drastically.

I was scared from the very beginning, as the lines on my FRERs weren't darkening quickly enough and I never got that ""dye stealer"" that I see posted a lot on r/TFABLinePorn.

While we're sad and grieving, my husband is a really optimistic and positive person and that's helping me get through this. As such, we're really hopeful for our future rainbow baby.

The doctor at the hospital said to wait one full cycle before TTC again, and I'm going to ask my family doctor about it when I have my follow up appointment with him in the next week or so, but I'm just curious as to what your experiences are - were you able to TTC again right away (assuming your cycles went back to normal quickly - I know it can vary for everyone)?

Today has been unlike any period i have ever had. The pain is worse than when I miscarried. And i soaked through a tampon in 2 hours, and another in 1 hour and a half. I switched to pads because i think that might be easier to track?

I (24) recently suffered from my second miscarriage in a row at the beginning of November. I was 5 weeks, so my first cycle following was very normal.

This cycle, I spotted for three days after what I believe to be O day, then started spotting again at 9dpo. I thought implantation for a second, then after the spotting came every day for 5 days straight, I realized this would eventually turn into my period. Low and behold, I started this afternoon after 5 days of consistent spotting.

My question is, do y'all think this is a result of imbalanced hormones from the miscarriage even though i've already had a normal cycle? My doctor won't check for progesterone levels or anything else until after my third miscarriage. Should I call the office and let them know how weird this cycle is?

My husband and I started TTC in August 2018, seven days ago my miscarriage happened, I was 6 weeks into my first pregnancy. We lost our ""pixel"" the day after Christmas, which just devastated me. Today my OB called to ask me to have my hCG levels tested again as they haven't reached 0. In that same conversation she asked how I was handling this emotionally...to which I said I thought I was ok.

But I'm not. How on Earth can I be when the one thing I've been dreaming of was taken away from me so suddenly and so quickly after I knew it was there? To top it off, it seems like every time I log in to social media all I'm seeing are friends and their little ones or pregnancy announcements. I know grieving is a process but the whole process sucks. I've watched this sub for a few days now, and am finally convinced I have enough courage to introduce myself.

I think the hardest thing right now is that the people I've told are all saying ""oh this is common,"" and ok, that may be true but when I share about my loss I need to know I'm not alone in this (outside of my husband, who has been so caring and compassionate, thank goodness for him). I need to know that what I'm feeling; devastation at losing ""pixel"" and terrified to even think of trying again for fear of experiencing this again, is normal. 

Going off of what I've read so far from this sub, this is exactly where I need to be. So thank you for being here and for reading.

Hi all, I'm a new member who never thought I'd be in this situation but here I am. I have one kid who is almost 3 and our perfectly timed #2 would have been due 6/28... Instead I had a complete mc at 6 weeks back in the beginning of November. I feel like I can't get past my grief and sadness about my loss until I have a successful pregnancy and those feelings are making me crazy. My cycles have always been every 28 days with military precision and I'm in cycle #2 of trying but my period is due Friday and all my FRERs so far are negative so I'm pretty sure I'm out this month. I'm doing all these nutty superstitious things (ie: no laundry on new years day so I don't 'wash away' a family member this year - what?!?) and just wallowing in my depression at all my BFNs this week instead of, ya know, participating in parenting the actual kid I already have. Every PMS symptom feels like a pregnancy symptom and then the subsequent period makes me feel so disappointed that it's like re-living the whole mc again. I only have one friend who's ever been through anything similar and we're really not close enough for us to talk much about it. All my close friends have no idea and keep spewing canned reassurances and ""I'm so sorry, your feelings are valid, I can't imagine"" etc that is kind and caring but just not helping. I'm also a NICU nurse which somehow makes my grief feel less valid because I've seen some horrible losses for other families that don't even compare to what I've been through - I dunno, it's a lot to unpack.

Over half of adults by age 40 have been infected with CMV. Once CMV is in a person‚Äôs body, it stays there for life and can reactivate. Most people infected with CMV show no signs or symptoms. However, CMV infections can cause serious health problems for unborn babies if a woman is first infected while pregnant. I had a completely normal pregnancy and had no idea she was so sick. Many babies infected with CMV in the womb go on to live full lives with minimal effects, while some experience deafness, developmental delays, visual issues, seizures, etc. Unfortunately, due to the severity of Her infection, she was born experiencing liver failure, low platelets, high bilirubin, and trouble breathing which progressed over the next few days to brain bleeds, hydrocephaly, seizures, and heart failure - the damage being so severe that she had no hope of living a normal life had she survived.

Hi everyone, having a rough day and I had previously found so much support in the TFAB and Bumpers subreddit, so it felt like the right time to make my intro here.
My husband and I started TTC this past summer, and we're some of the lucky ones to get pregnant in our 3rd cycle of trying. At my first and second Ob appointments everything appeared fine. I had some major food aversions and nausea, but other than that I was fine. At our 12w appointment, that is when everything changed. We elected to do the NT scan US, mostly because our insurance covered it. DH and I are both 29 and healthy, so expected it to be a formality. During the scan I got to see my little jelly bean actually look like a baby, with wiggly arms and toes. 
Unfortunately our Ob thought something in the baby's brain didn't look right and sent us to a MFM specialist. After getting a more in-depth US that took about an hour, the physician told us that the baby's brain was not developing correctly, and barely at all. It had severe ventriculomegaly in all the spaces, causing the cortex to be highly underdeveloped. They couldn't even find a cerebellum. After a very long conversation with so many questions, it became clear that our baby would have little to no chance of making it to term, let alone after. We made the gut wrenching decision to TFMR. That was about 2 weeks ago. 

I have a D+C scheduled for Thursday, when I will be 14w+5. It will be completed by my Ob in an outpatient surgery center, and it sounds like I will be under anesthesia for it. On one hand I am ready to take this next step to start moving on, but on the other hand I am scared. Scared of feeling worse after, of not being able to emotionally get past this. I also have no idea what to expect, so the unknowing is also hard.
I would love any words of wisdom as to what to expect with the D+C. What is the recovery like? What coping mechanisms have you found solace in.

My best friend (Jess, fake name) has been going through a very difficult time over the past year and a half. To sum things up quickly, her boyfriend lost his job and started using crack. She tried to help him get better, but ended up using herself and getting addicted. He is also physically and mentally abusive. (This is an extremely shortened version; there‚Äôs so much more to the story.) I live about four hours away, so I visit when I can and try to help. I was pregnant last year when her troubles got really bad (I knew about the boyfriends drug use, but not her own or the physical abuse). It was more difficult to visit her, and honestly my husband did not think it was a good idea for me to be in that kind of environment. My pregnancy ended in a TFMR in October.

Jess stopped responding to texts and phone calls about a month ago. I was trying to find out what was going on (basically find out if she was still alive,) and a mutual friend accidentally spilled the beans that Jess had gotten pregnant and decided not to continue. This is her second time ending an unwanted pregnancy. 

On one hand, I believe almost all women terminate for the same reason- it would be harder to continue the pregnancy than it would be to end it. There isn‚Äôt an easy choice, just a less hard one. On the other hand, I don‚Äôt even know what to say to her. I‚Äôm mad at the entire world that some people try and try for a healthy baby and some people get pregnant who don‚Äôt want to. 

I‚Äôm also devastated that she felt like she couldn‚Äôt tell me. She was extremely supportive of me in October, and I feel so terrible that she couldn‚Äôt rely on me.

My home where the walls are reminders of my loss. Where the rooms don't sit in the order I'm used to, and don't hold my belongings just right.

I terminated in the beginning of September and by the end of that month I was so sure that the rest of my life would be impossible. I tried desperately to turn back and find my old home. When that failed, because my old home was nothing more than ash and the suggestion of an old and familiar, but entirely unreachable normal, I began to force the walls of my new home to resemble something they could never be. I spent a few months pushing at these walls. I'd curse my new home for being so *different*. Why couldn't I get back to normal? Why couldn't I rearrange this alien floor plan to match that of the home which had, for all intents and purposes, kicked me out? And why, if I desired it so much, did the memories of my life before the loss seem less and less to belong to me? 

Over the past two weeks, after a negative test and a really serious examination of my mindset and expectations, I've settled in. It's still alien at times, but I'm not fighting it. It will never be my old home and I'm living here for a horrible, terrible reason, but the more I fight against reality the more betrayed by life I feel. 

The *what if*s still come up here and there. I still wish I'd be having my baby early next year. I wish I'd met Simon and got to take him home. In this new home, this new life, I will always live under the (mostly) silent memory of my loss. Some days I don't think of him directly or cry over the loss, which is a major improvement from when I was sobbing daily. Most days I'm making plans to build within this new house, to grow my new life, without butting heads with the circumstances. They weren't my choice, but they are here for good and my only choice is in how I deal with them. 

So here's to the new normal. I hope everyone here finds some peace and discovers their own way to settle into the new life that grief has thrust upon you. In the early days I really didn't have hope that it could ever *get better* and truthfully it didn't. My loss will always be with me, making life just a little bit more painful than it would have been otherwise. But at least I'm moving forward rather than trying to run back to *before*. (Everyone told me that this was impossible, but I had to try for myself anyway, and you probably did / will too.) Time isn't slipping away from under me anymore. I'm here, present, and ready to walk forward (totally willingly, rather than full of rancid resent and anger) into a new year, with my new life.

We got in right away due to me being high risk and confirmed with ultrasound we were pregnant. On October 10th we told everyone because I was starting to show. October 11th, we went to the high risk doctor for an ultrasound and I knew something wasn‚Äôt right the tech moved to fast, she had me get dressed and then I told my husband something was wrong and he tried to calm me. Doctor came in and told me my baby didn‚Äôt have a heartbeat and hadn‚Äôt developed. On October 12th I had the D&C.

This is my first post here, and I can't help but already feel this is a safe place to be after lurking and commenting the last few months. My husband and I finally start the TTC journey soon, and I wanted to reach out because my emotions are all over the place and I could use the support.  


August 10th our first child, a beautiful baby girl, passed away shortly after an emergency c-section. To make our story short I won't go too in detail, suffice to say medical negligence was involved. She had developed hydrops fetalis somewhere around the 32-33 week mark, I developed mirror syndrome, and it wasn't until 35 weeks gestation that the c-section was finally done. I had gotten to the point where I almost passed away as well on the table (hemorrhage and high blood pressure issues) and suffered a tremendous amount leading up to that day. I'm struggling with PTSD along with grieving our daughter. We had so many dreams for and of her. My husband and I have been together for 8 years in January, married 3. We dreamed of our daughter for at least 5 years, we couldn't wait to meet her. I miss her so much and most of the time I have no idea what to do with the emptiness and silence that used to be her.   


Fast forward to now, the hospital that actually serviced me in the end was amazing, the doctor in charge then is my doctor now. I have so much faith in her and we were told it should never happen again. The hydrops was classified Nonimmune and Idiopathic, so they never found out why, but the odds of re-occurrence are astronomically low and we already have a game plan for next pregnancy. I healed beautifully from the c-section, still running some tests on my heart with a new physician and other than getting to the bottom of low blood pressure issues I'm now dealing with (wth right?), will be ready to TTC starting this coming Feb. That all sounds wonderful written out, but I just can't seem to get it in my head that we'll ever take home a living child. Luna was born breathing, but we never got to hear her cry. She was pretty much full term, and thankfully we got to hold her later that evening, but I can't picture motherhood beyond pregnancy now.

My OBGYN decided to run some tests during the summer after my chemical pregnancy. Everything came back clean, and was told it was maybe a fluke and try again. We got pregnant in September and then they followed it really closely. Around week 6.5 I went in for my first ultrasound and there was only fetal pole. So of course, I was heartbroken and already knew not to get my hopes up. They said come back in a few weeks. So I did, this time there was just a sac, not even an indication of a start of a fetal pole. So of course, this is a blighted ovum. I carried that until 11.5 weeks (actually almost 12), then I had the miscarriage in the middle of the night. Most of us have been there, but honestly mine was probably not that traumatic, in my opinion at least. Maybe I just knew what to expect. Anyways the following week, I went into the doctor for a follow-up, explained her that the miscarriage happened and that I was still bleeding a little, but not too bad. She suggested that we got to a fertility specialist (RE). So we decided on one, she referred us and we set an appointment. 

&#x200B;

Fast-forward to the last month. So I went to see a chiropractor/acupuncturist because I would rather go about this in a more ""natural"" way rather than shoving a bunch of fertility meds down my throat. So I have two doctors my RE and my chiro. I seen my chiro first, he requested my records and told me to come back in a few weeks. The next week I went to see my RE he said that really he thinks it might be genetic, still... as we all know, but he wanted to try a few things. He ran a few tests, put me on an antibiotic, and then whenever we get a positive OPK to call and we would start a regium of progesterone and  baby aspirin. He also threw out the idea of doing clomid, for the ""more eggs in a basket"" approach. I don't really agree with that, so my husband and I finally decided NOT do that. 

&#x200B;

I went into the chiropractor for a follow-up from our first appointment. He thinks its most likely a hormone imbalance, most likely a progesterone thing, BUT is annoyed that the RE isn't even checking my progesterone before starting on the regium. He also thinks all the tests they have ran are dumb. Now I have two doctors with two different opinions. My chiro even said that he thinks that clomid isn't what I need, since I have gotten pregnant EVERY time we have tried. 

&#x200B;

My chiro wants to start checking my progesterone soon to see where my levels are. I want to try again soon but all this shit stresses me out.
